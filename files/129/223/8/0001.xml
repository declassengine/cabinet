PRIMARY HEALTH CARE

^^^^pandum by the Secretary of State for Social Services

I have propo^pji^ubstantial redirection of primary health care

priorities forKw important reasons.    First,   last year&apos;s Primary Health

Care Review sh^fcd^he need to reform primary care - the family doctor

service in parti^R|^    We need good doctors in all areas, but

particularly in thQ^^k attractive inner cities and in remote rural

areas.    There has t^pk^i^reater emphasis on prevention, with more

vaccination,  immunisafciojkcervical cytology and screening for heart

disease and hypertensi^K^Services have to be better targetted at the

vulnerable, eg children and the elderly.    The worst surgeries in inner

cities are appalling and must be upgraded.    The key to improvement is a

performance-related remuneration system designed to encourage doctors to

provide better services, more comnetition between doctors by giving

patients a more informed choic^^^^ more effective Family

Practitioner Committees.    Expeo^JjXfcs that we will act to improve primary

care are high following last yeai^B^iew and the Bill will give the

necessary powers. ^^^^

2. Secondly,  there are Public ExpeH|LaAe Survey (PES) considerations.

I have agreed with the Chief Secretary^^^^sury to raise  80 million next

year by selling off the loan portfolio qjTO|kGeneral Practice Finance

Corporation and to take action to meet my^^K^c substantial inherited

commitments  from earlier surveys.    This me^s ^^t it will not be possible

to leave things just as they are in the fieLd^^c%patient charges. There

is no realistic possibility of raising additional revenue outside the

dental and optical areas (prescription charge exemptions will be examined

separately in my PES negotiations with the Chief Secretary, Treasury). To

raise patient charges merely to meet my existing PES commitments would be

seen as essentially negative,  leaving us open to accus^bns over National

Health Service  (NHS)  financing and failure to act on^Awrimary Care

Review.

3. My proposal is  to raise  140 million per annum by enRitf^^he free NHS

sight test  for those who can afford to pay;  by introduc ing^L emerge for

dental examinations,  currently free for everyone; and by movjd^^o a 75

per cent proportional charge basis  for NHS dental examination^B^^k

treatment.    The effects of the proposed dental charges are gi-v 5^B|k

Annex 1.    The new charges would not be applied to those at prese^^

entitled to free dental treatment  (nearly half - see Annex 2) or spj^fccle


vouchers.    But those who can afford to pay would do so.    New revenue from

Vpatients would allow me to meet my existing PES commitments and to deliver

highly desirable primary care changes.    Annex 3 lists a range which we

^^elieve should be achieved.    These could not be afforded otherwise - I

dVw&gt;ld not feel justified in bidding for new money, given the demands of

rfcoatoitals, for AIDS etc.

The Home and Social Affairs Committee (H) discussions have focussed

on the proposed charge for dental examination.    The ending of free sight

tests for those who can afford to pay has not presented colleagues with

similar difficulties.    But charges for dental work are well established

and the incj^asing emphasis on preventive dentistry means that the

boundary4Aen examination and treatment will become increasingly

blurred ^JR^kfuture.    Moreover,  the proposed examination charge is very

low.    At un^^^^2&gt;  its effect on demand must be expected to be slight and

short-lived^kXi^ time dental charges were substantially increased there

was a short-tern &lt;Bop in demand, which recovered quickly. Moreover,

dental health nll^^p roved substantially in recent years and this  is due

not just to dents^|Ae but to improved nutrition,  dental health education

and flouride.    Nev^bflKess,  I accept that some will seek to present a

charge for examinat^^Kiy* a change of principle, affecting access to NHS

treatment.    I believe^thjkit will be essential,  therefore,  to present the

new charge pattern in &lt;^recbntext of a consumer-related package of primary

care reforms, and for that we need to raise enough from patients to

deliver change without further call on the Exchequer.    The presentation

will have to be very positive highlighting the benefits to the public.

Nine out of ten contacts with the^HS are with the primary care services

and the average patient sees thte^^iily doctor about four times a year.

Improvements in this area will^J^^v visible politically and welcomed.

I  intend to publish a White Pape^^Tkhe same time as the Bill and will be

circulating a draft to H Committeew^A^gues in due course.

5.      I invite colleagues&apos; agreement ^^tjdfcspackage of primary care

ANNEX 2

EXEMPTION AND REMISSIONS FROM CHARGES

A. Dental Charges

1 Treatment is free for:

- those under 18 (except that those over 16 and not in full-time

education pay for dentures);

- those under 19 in full-time education;

- expectant mothers and those with a baby under one year;

- low income groups, defined in terms of Supplementary Benefit or

Family Income Support levels (Income Support or Family Credit from

1 April 1988).

2 Those close to the low income level can apply for free treatment or

help with charges - individual assessments are made.

3 About 46 per cent of courses of treatment are provided free under

these arrangements.

4 All these groups would continue to get free examinations under the

proposed arrangements.

B. Optical Charges

1 Free NHS spectacles were replaced by vouchers in July 1986. Voucher

values are fixed at levels which allow the patient to obtain basic

spectacles without further payment (a more expensive selection can be

made if the patient pays the excess).

2 Those entitled to vouchers are:

- children under 16;

- those under 19 in full-time education;

- low income groups (as for dental charges);

- users of certain complex lenses, eg high power, prismatic form.

3 Those close to the low income level may apply for assessment for

full- or part-value vouchers.

4 Vouchers cover about 27 per cent of patients needing spectacles.

5 Those who do not pay for spectacles at present would continue to get

free NHS sight tests under the proposed arrangements, as would the

registered blind, the partially sighted and war pensioners with

optical disabilities.

1 GPs&apos; pay to be related to meeting targets

for vaccination, immunisation, cervical

cytology.   Special payments for surveillance

3 Performance-related pay designed to encourage

greater commitment by doctors. Consumer

awareness.   More choice for patients.  15m

4 Dental health campaign; more fluoridation;

dentists into under-dentisted areas; protected
