I//// THE QUEEN&apos;S SPEECH ON THE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT

Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council

I attach a drafiyoTSjThe Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament in the

form in which r^-h&amp;s been agreed by The Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future

Legislation CommitfreeY)  The text will have to be submitted to The Queen on

Thursday 18 June.\^^^)

2. The draft is buillJ/j&gt;n\our Manifesto and on the legislative programme

that was provisionally&lt;^^Vd by the Cabinet on 26 March (CC(87) 12.5).

It takes account of the fa &gt; ihat the Criminal Justice Bill, the Finance

Bill and the Local GoverrhteJ*T)Ril 1, most of which fell at the Dissolution,

will need to be reintroduci&amp;&gt;J- ^A.

3. The order of the Speech^oI&gt;^s the conventional arrangement but it

is, at some 1,100 words, appre^raM^longer than any Speech in recent

years.    We should not allow it t^^lfrpiw. any longer.

COMMITMENTS TO LEGISLATION

W  

4. We shall need to settle the detaiks/pyfj&gt;the legislative programme in

the light of the decisions that we takeV^ft The Queen&apos;s Speech.    At this

stage,  the main points to which I draw m^colleagues&apos; attention are as

follows -

a. Even if no substantial additions arejri?3k to the programme that

was provisionally approved in March, thisfos 4*1 exceptionally heavy

burden of legislation.    We shall be in an &gt;3b^8-9^ble position if many

of our larger and more contentious Bills cannQtA/e- introduced until

the New Year. ^~~y/1l

b. Work is still needed to settle the policy ovt^k^&amp;\pi. our most

politically important Bills.    Since these are the BiYLs^that will

take up most time in both Houses, however, we must ^Jp oj*r\utmost to

ensure that they are ready for introduction as soon a^jjpjlaible. I

believe we shall need to take a view on the way in whuriJ^LVyislation

on housing should be distributed between the coming SessAow^md the

following one. ^1 IS\

c. The Secretary of State for the Environment has now obtVinj^^

colleagues&apos; approval for the modified approach to water privarlsa^on


that was foreshadowed when Cabinet last considered the legislative

S. programme.    The letter of 15 June from the Chancellor of the

)j Exchequer&apos;s office explains his reasons for wishing to see the main

yCtS.      Water Privatisation Bill included in the forthcoming Session. Under

&apos;&quot;^V.    the provisionally approved programme, however, the Department of the

O///    Environment already have three major Bills.    The letter of 16 June by

^/^^the Secretary of State for the Environment makes it clear that he

/^(es not believe that enacting this Bill in the 1987-88 Session is a

^^r^listic timetable.    We shall need to take a clear decision on this.

^k^yMe noted in our earlier discussion that there were arguments

b^n*^rays on proceeding quickly with legislation to implement the

WaWock Report on the alleviation of human infertility.    We should

setcie that question now.

e.     The Cabjnet noted on 26 March that further proposals might be

coming for^a&quot;r\h on matters affecting the City.    The Secretary of State

for TradeV^ajjd^Lcidus try has now told us, however, that the only City

matter on whAc^Tne sees a need to legislate in the forthcoming

Session is tTm-^Wgtly technical question of clearing arrangements in

financial mark^raywhich would not be appropriate for mention in The

Queen&apos;s Speech, v^v^^
