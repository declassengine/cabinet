EUROPEAN COMMUNITY FUTURE FINANCING

Memorancll^the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary,  the Chancellor of

the Exc^Hp^b and the Minister of Agriculture,  Fisheries and Food

As  in Brussels ,   the question of European Community  (EC) future

financing will diJmWfl^* the Copenhagen European Council on 4-5 December.

The prospects  for ^^^Mement are poor;  and the United Kingdom may be

blamed if no agreeme%^r5kreached.    Cabinet may therefore wish to be aware

in advance of the bacKgj^P^l,  our objectives,  the position reached in the

negotiation, and point^^elevant to our presentation of the outcome.

BACKGROUND

2. The Community has been 1 ivioj^beyond its means.    It  is  funded by

Customs Duties and agr icul tura AM^e s,  topped up by payments by each

member state of up to 1.4 per cafc^^^^its  (harmonised) Value Added Tax

(VAT) base  (equivalent  to 1.02 pe^h^fc of Gross National Product  (GNP) ).

But  its spending is now running at^^^Bfct29 billion a year,  equivalent to

1.63 per cent VAT  (1.17 per cent GNP^^^rhe Commission and most member

states now wish to validate this by a^^fl^ease ^n the &quot;Own Resources&quot;

ceiling.    The possibility of a further^T^BBase of 1.6 per cent VAT from

January 1988 was  foreseen in  1984,  when ^U^^^ per cent ceiling was set:

the Commission wish to go  further,  and ra^^t^R cei 1 ing to  1.4 per cent

GNP (2.2 per cent VAT)),   though they envisage^J^-ceilings to keep

spending below 1.3 per cent GNP (1.9 per cenli^^rj until 1992. All

Southern member states,  and the Irish,  agree.    Most Northern member states

find the Commission&apos;s ideas over-ambitious.    But all are anxious to secure

some extra provision for agricultural spending.    And it is clear that some

increase in the ceiling is necessary if the Community i^to get through

1988.    The Commission&apos;s  1988 budget proposals,  blocke^Wkus  (and - for

different reasons - Greece and Spain) contain pr ovis i^JfajL  2.5 billion

of spending above  the ceiling.    But  to raise the ceilin^BKjk^ires

unanimity.    This gives us real leverage.

3. The runaway growth of Common Agricultural Policy  (CAPT%^^king (up

from  9 billion in 1983 to  19 billion this year)  is the basi^^LJbe of

the overspending.    All member states accept,   though some  (eg tl^^H^ch)

more whole-heartedly than others  (eg the Germans)  that  it must ff^ved

in.    All also accept  in principle that  it cannot be right that tw^-thj^s

of the agricultural budget and half of the total EC budget is now s^Rir^on

the storage and disposal of surplus  food.    The French agree that the CAP


has become an inefficient means of farm support, and needs reform, though

I    they do not want to go as far as we think is right.    But the Germans,

^^unable to compete effectively with eg the French in a more competitive

kAnarket,  and anxious to maintain the structure of smallholdings  in Southern

W^fmrmany s want to slow the pace of reform.

^^.^ LBecause our abatement forms part of the system of Own Resources it

G^rr  part of the negotiations.    The mechanism secured by the Prime

Minister at Fontainebleau in 1984,  in the context of the last increase in

Own Resources,  ensures that two-thirds of the difference between our share

of Community VAT and of Community spending is deducted.    This has saved us

over  2.8 billion in the last four years.    Even so our annual net

contributio^^kfter abatement has risen from  550 million in  1984 to

 900 millRM^ ,  and we remain the second largest contributor.

OBJECTIVES &quot;^^I^L

5. In the negW^^Aons over the last nine months our aims have been -

a. to secure^K|^tem of effective and binding control over

Community spendi^^^^^

b. to build supp^^^^br keeping the necessary increase in Community

resources to the lowest feasible level which will cover 1988 needs

and credibly last through to 1992 and beyond; and

c. of unique importance to us, to maintain our Abatement.

PRESENT POSITION ^^^L

6. The current position in the nSfcp^^^ions is described in UKREP

telno 4094  (copy attached). ^^^^m

w

7. At the Prime Minister&apos;s insistence^EnJune European Council agreed

to strengthen budget discipline,  applying^^KAo all Community expenditure.

There now are proposals on the table for ^WWw^ budget discipline;

better monitoring of agricultural spending ^k^&gt;e^mit a swifter response to

threatened expenditure overshoots;  and the iny ^^tion of &quot;stabiliser&quot;

mechanisms for individual crops.    These would Turing prices down when

excess production threatened, and would mark a real improvement on present

arrangements.    But the Commission also seek a substantial once-for-all

increase in the provision for agricultural spending, already overshot:

and many member states want wide &quot;exceptional circumstar^^&quot; provisions

which would permit  further overshoots.    Several,  led b41A Germans, wish

to see weaker &quot;stabilisers&quot;.    We have made clear that w%^ud^an effective

control total,  constraining spending through &quot;stabi1iserg^^k^^ shal1 not

agree to an increase  in Own Resources. ^^^^^k

8. The accusation most often levelled at us now is that we cft^^^lding

out for an unreal is t ical ly rapid reform,  and failing to take aWe^G^

account of the social consequences  for small farmers in the CommKdW^ We

consider it essential to use our current  leverage to extract bind^^^^k

commitments to effective &quot;stabilisers&quot; and budgetary control proceSira^^

2


.    This  is  important also in the wider context of world agriculture and the

m  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    If it proves impossible to

^^omplete the  task at Copenhagen this week,  we shall have to keep going,

^^fctn the Dutch and the Commission.    The logic of the case for CAP reform

^ i^^trong,  and increasingly widely recognised,  and it must be  in farmers&apos;

^^^^interests that it  is tackled now.

9. The pressure for increased EC resources also arises from a political

link, made by Southern member states and the Irish,  between increases in

the Structural Funds  (ie primarily the Regional and Social Funds) and

their co-^^ation  in the drive to complete the Single Market by 1992.

SoutherAMi^er states make the claim,  economically tenuous but

pol i t icanff^mpel 1 ing,   that they need assistance to help them prepare for

the challe^E^3f more open competition.    The political reality is that

they could W^^^omplet ion of the Single Market,  which is a major United

Kingdom i n t e r^I        ome  increase in the Structural Funds  is also likely to

be necessary  in^d^^K to secure stringent control over agricultural

spending.    Our ai^K^^t be  to contain the  increase within the rates of

growth of such s p ea^^^L wh i c h are laid down  in the EC Treaty.

10. The Commissions^s^^^kposa1,  backed by all Southern member states, is

for a 100 per cent increase (in real terms) by 1992,  ie an increase of

some  5 billion.    This would drive a coach and horses through all budget

discipline.    With the French, Germans and Dutch, we have campaigned for

markedly lower numbers, and for offsetting savings, and the Prime Minister

will continue  to do so in CopenhJ^n.    The odds are that we shall be the

back-markers:     if the CopenhaAnm^et ing breaks down on this,  we can

accordingly expect criticism, ^^^^m.

11. On the United Kingdom Abatemgjri^^^e Commission propose a replacement

for the Fontainebleau mechanism whiB^-#t^ken together with their

proposals on the structure of Own Re^ttd^^| - would  increase our annual

net contribution by over  600 mi 11 i on ^&gt;r^p|fr estimates  ( 150/200 million

on theirs).     If all other issues are seW^H^t Copenhagen, the

negotiation  is unlikely to break down ove^^h^^batemen t:  but  if others

cannot be settled we shall come under pressur^J^We have made clear that

we will not accept any change to the Fontairl^leau mechanism which would

make our budget burden more onerous.    What we have, we hold.

12. If an overall  financing deal proves elusive at Copenhagen, several

member states may argue that the Community must at lea^X settle the 1988

budget problem.    There will be calls  for an  interim im^ase  in the

1.4 per cent VAT ceiling.    We shall have to block th^J|jAr allowing it

would significantly reduce our leverage to secure our jfl^J^ob jec t ive .

13. If at Copenhagen we can -  

a. secure measures ensuring effective and binding cod^^^Mof EC

spending,  particularly on the CAP;

b. sufficiently scale down Southern aspirations  for the S^rucjkral

Funds and hence the increase in the overall ceiling; and

3


L c.      maintain the Fontainebleau Abatement;

^At would  in our judgment be right  to allow some  increase  in the ceiling,

^^n^t  increase should be sufficient  to cover real  1988 requirements: and

ceiling should be durable,   lasting through and beyond this

S^^^^ment.

PRESENTATION

14. There will be no partial agreements at Copenhagen,   for all member

states liptf^l the key issues (except the 1988 budget); and maintaining

such 1 inMgm^including the  1988 budget)  is essential  to our strategy.

15. On mosMtThe plausible scenarios for a breakdown, many of our

partners wilr^^^^^o blame us.    But  this should not create serious

difficulties: ^Uie^tesence of our position is that it  is our duty to the

tax-payer to ensu^^^kat the same disciplines which apply to other

national public exJ^^ure apply also to Community spending.    We would as

necessary stress t[M^\

a. excess CAP s^A^g harms  the Community&apos;s  image,  both in

Europe and beyond ^and  is damaging to the long-term interests of

farmers themselves;

b. while some growth of the Structural Funds  is desirable,

uncontrolled growth would nqflfebe cost-effective;

c. our EC budgetary burde^K^kpgnised as excessive  in  1984, has

since grown, making our case^E^^n Abatement even stronger;

d. the solution to the  1988 pfcblw^lies  in real reform,  not a

fudge with hard decisions postponS|^^k

e. proper CAP spending control,  i^J^^^achieved at Copenhagen, will

come  in the end,  perhaps at the next^k^ba^n Council  (in Hanover),

for the need is  increasingly recognisea ;^^B^

f. our campaign for it has been in firm alliance with the Dutch and

the Commission, and with some support from the French, Danes, Spanish

and Portuguese.

Any more general criticism of us  for concentrating onAwmicing detail,

and so producing a parochial and unproductive mee t ing^Jj^k tras t to the

Reagan/Gorbachev summit,  should be  rebutted similarly. ^^^J^sive

agricultural surpluses and support are a worldwide problekjjfckkling it

will cause difficulties elsewhere too, but the Community i^TnaB.ng a

serious effort,   and some progress. ^^^^W

16. An overall agreement at Copenhagen,   if available,  could a^Cj^m.

presented positively.    There would be domestic criticism of inci^^w^Lin

the resource ceiling and the budget discipline limit on agricultulfel^SL

expenditure.    But we would stress that past budget discipline arran^Rnents

had proved an inadequate constraint,  that expenditure was in effect

4


already well above the ceiling,  and that, while retaining the Abatement,

Lwe had secured real improvements  in spending control for the  future which

P^hould ensure that expenditure is held within the new ceiling for at least

flwe years.    Parliament would of course have to ratify the increase.

accordingly invite Cabinet to note that -

a. Any agreement at Copenhagen would have to include unwelcome

elements, notably additional Own Resources and agricultural

expendi ture.

b. AW^our negotiating objectives are important:    securing them

wour^J^Aesent a significant milestone for the Community,  and a

succes^^B^our policies.

c. The ffscBsions  in Copenhagen will be difficult.    If no

agreement reached, we shall stick to our guns, drawing

attention tj^^^fcprogress already made,   the underlying wide support

for real CAP anc* tne likelihood that  it will  in the end be

achieved.    We a^^J^^play down talk of 11:1  isolation,  or of &quot;crisis

in the Community^,

2. IT  IS  NOW  OVER NINE MONTHS  SINCE THE  COMMISSION   FIRST PUT

ORWARD  ITS PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS  TO DEAL WITH THE COMMUNITY&apos;S

INANCIAL PLIGHT.  ONE EUROPEAN  COUNCIL,  TWO  CONCLAVES,  SEVEN FOREIGN

FFAIRS  COUNCILS,  NUMEROUS  STERILE  DAYS  AND  NIGHTS  IN THE

GRICULTURE  COUNCIL AND  MORE  THAN  THIRTY-FIVE  SPECIAL  COREPERS LATER

E ARE  STILL  SHORT OF AGREED  SOLUTIONS  TO  THE  MAIN PROBLEMS.

3. THE  COMMISSION HAVE   FARED  BETTER  THAN WAS ORIGINALLY EXPECTED

N HOLDING  THEIR PACKAGE  TOGETHER.   ALTHOUGH  THIS  CONTAINS ELEMENTS

E (AND OTHERS)   CANNOT ACCEPT,   SUCH  AS  DOUBLING OF THE STRUCTURAL

IhE   four  poorest member states off paying   for our abatement remain

jo haunt the   final stages, although  the tax  at least seems to be

jading.

4. IT  is now  CERTAIN that the european  council WILL have to

IrAPPLE  itself with the main elements of agricultural stabilisers.

i0alition politics  in germany,  cohabitation politics in   france and

(HE RELUCTANCE of most agriculture ministers to grasp nettles have

loNSPIRED to bring about that unsatisfactory state of affairs.

IrEVIOUS  experience of agricultural NEGOTIATION at european council

IEVEL is not encouraging.  but if,  a very  big IF, we, the dutch and

IhE commission can extract the right decisions on cereals, oilseeds

Ind  proteins  then the* rest of the  presidency  stabiliser proposals

lOULD   fall  into place. there could however be considerable pressure

jo avoid taking decisions at copenhagen on other products.

5. budget discipline  is the other  side of the cap reform coin, an

essential  complement to it but not,  as experience since

fONTAINEBLEAU has shown, a SUBSTITUTE   for it.  WE are not too far from

In acceptable outcome,  with a tightly  circumscribed exceptional

JlRCUM stanc e provision,  but the waters have  been greatly muddied by

IeLORS&apos;  revival of his proposal   for a reserve and CONFUSeO

Presentation of it. the stock disposal issue remains open, with

Considerable support for an off-guideline wiping of the slate but

lione for doing so on the basis of national financing. the choices

ire more political than financial here and an agreed outcome should

be achievable.

6. the structural fund argument will be pretty straightforward,

mow much? for whom? but it will not be easy to resolve, now that the

(southerners1 appetite has been whetted by the* doubling proposal,

there is solid resistance to that by most of the northerners (who

btand to lose more relatively than we do, given their greater

[prosperity and the operation of the abatement). an agreed outcome is

Likely to be more costly than we would wish, but, a uk position

(tougher than that of the other northerers, particularly the french

would seem hard to justify.

7. that leaves the level of own resources and the abatement. on

(the former, ratchetting down of the commision 1.4 percent gnp

[proposal is in full swing with french, german and dutch support. on

 the latter, the predictable attempt to squeeze us is being made but

imost member states are doing little more than go through the

[motions. the crucial thing is to switch the focus away from the size

md h ian 8320

f the abatement to the size of our budget burden even after

batement. the fact that our budget burden has more than doubled

ince fontainebleau and is set to go on increasing steadily (if

lowly, and changing more slowly than that of other member states)

f the revenue ceiling is raised, should bring acceptance that the

iontainebleau mechanism, technically adapted as necessary to fit a

our resource community, is the only possible basis for a

ettlement.

8. so much for the trees, but what about the wood? i believe

! here is a genuine desire on all sides to take decisions at

openhagen. the contrast between the copenhagen and washington

eetings is the flavour of the week amongst commentators and

iarticipants alike. it is a little facile, but it masks real concern

i hat, if the community cannot get its financial and agricultural act

! ogether after so many months of negotiation, then it will be unable

lo defend and to further its common interests in the increasingly

(ncertain world that faces it. the 1988 calendar (french

iresidential elections, greek presidency in second half of the year,

ower vacuum in washington) reinforces this concern.

9. nevertheless, it would be foolish to refuse to recognise that

Me odds have recently lengthened against a successful outcome at

openhagen. concern, and indeed a strong desire, to take decisions

here is one thing: willingness to take the right ones quite

nother. as you said yourself the other day, we need to avoid

&apos;apocalypse now*&apos; interpretations of failure or an

ver-dramatisation of the differences that led to it. not only is

uch an approach invalid in fact but it also in the longer-term

iilitates against the achievement of our objectives. the more the

ebate is polarised, the less easy it is for others to concede the

round they must if there is to be an agreement at hanover or

omewhere else. it is precisely because of that that some will wish

0 focus on the abatement and seek an alibi for failure there. our

nterest is to keep the debate firmly focused on agricultural

e form.
