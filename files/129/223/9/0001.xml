CABINET

1987 PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY

^^^^ Memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury

REPORT ON Tl^Sp^ERALS

At  its meeting^|^3^^) Cabinet set  itself the twin objectives of holding

the level of pub^^L^ppenditure as close as possible to the existing

planning totals anVaJsnsuring that its share of national income, without

allowing for privat^Ek^kn proceeds,  continued on a declining path,

keeping within the pa^ce^fcages in last year&apos;s White Paper.

2. I have conducted bilateral discussions with colleagues against that

background.

3. The starting point was that Cabinet had agreed in July to add

 1 billion to provision for loc^^^uthority current expenditure in

1988-89.    Subsequently figures ^^k^^greed for the later two years,

leading to additions of:

  billion

^^^88-89     1989-90 1990-91

TAkO 1.3 1.5

1 was  faced with further additional bids o^^Th^rema in ing programmes of:

7^0 9.6 12.3

In the course of bilateral discussions additions to programmes have been

agreed of almost exactly half these amounts:

3.6 fcCl 6-2

A large part of these  increases were unavoidable;  this ^^^k^rue, for

example,  of the very large estimating changes for expena^tj^^&gt;n social

security benefits,  and also of EC contributions.    Others ^re^lready

committed,  eg Launch Aid,  the carry through of the Review ^^fbw awards

in the National Health Service and the decision on compensatroVJbr income

support claimants of cost of 20 per cent rates contribution. I^jfw?

settlements also involved some difficult policy changes.    Detai^^i^ set

out in Annex A. ?


4. Thus total additions to programmes,  including local authority current

expenditure, are:

% 4.6 6.1 7.7

^W^mpared with the Reserves which have been published for the first two

yej^ of:

~ 5.5 7.5

leaving uncommitted only: 0.9 1.4 -

The sums wJflhch thus remain  in  the Reserves fall far short of those

publishe  ^^iis year&apos;s White Paper and are manifestly inadequate.

5. At CaD^P^j^he Chancellor will set out  the level of Reserves which he

believes wiry^^^^quired and,   in the light of this, he will then put

proposals  to omLlaft^ues on the increased planning totals  to be adopted for

the next three sB^P^

RUNNING COSTS ANdI^^^ER

6. Running cost pravL^ ,  though within the programme totals given in

the Autumn Statement,       not separately identified until publication of

the Public Expenditure White Paper.

7. Cabinet agreed in July that I should aim to keep roughly constant the

share of running costs  in total ^^lic expenditure,  and seek to reduce by

at  least half the bids  for 198^^B^(then  760 million,  since increased to

some  800 million by late bids^i^^^lso agreed that  firm provision for

the later years should depend on^Bfc^^reparation by all Departments of

management plans committing them ^^^ fc^al and progressive efficiency

gains equal at least  to \\ per cent^f ^ieir running cost expenditure.

Where these plans could not be prepa^R^J^agreed in time,  settlement of

the later years should be held over u^^J^e 1988 Survey.

8. For 1988-89,   I have reached settleme^^^^olving additions to

baseline of some   560 million.    This is hiyieijyian the target which I

proposed  in July but close to be objective c^^OTStraining running costs

to their present share of the planning total.    For the later years,  I have

agreed firm provision for ten Departments on the basis of suitable

management plans.    Others are committed to developing plans which will

provide a basis for similar agreements in next year&apos;s Survey.

9. Civil Service manpower for April  1988 will remaslme to the last

published figure of 594,000.    Present  indications are^H^^^aumbers will

fall to some 590,000 in  1988 and will remain roughly st^^kjy-iereafter.

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

10. Following the Government&apos;s response to the House of Lord JK^ai t tee

in July which said that decisions on science and technology sp^BB^ would

be reported in the Public Expenditure White Paper, arrangements^^^ejbeen


k     made to monitor the position during the Survey.    The net addition to

provision for science and technology spending is currently of the order of

^^ 230/ 270/ 200 million in the three Survey years.    This results in large

 ^irt from the agreement to provide Launch Aid  for Airbus and the additions

^^Jk^ universities and the Research Councils within the education programme.

^UfciS^f igures could change slightly as a result of the Department of Trade

^jn^pkndustry&apos;s review of innovation policy.    Overall it  is  likely that

s^rending on civil science and technology spending (including technology

transfer) will grow by 7i/3i/  per cent in the three years.

THE OUTTURN FOR 1987-88

11. The  ;^nnt: estimate  for the outturn in  1987-88 is  that  the planning

total wil^^B^gadershot by  1 billion.    This  is entirely accounted for by

higher proc^J^^fcrom sales of housing,  commercial property and land by

local authorlkS^fcnd new towns.    Other spending is  in aggregate more or

less in  line wwtiMans.    1 do not regard this undershoot as providing

room to accommo^lk^^^aims on the Reserve from other areas of expenditure,

particularly give^^fc^ na tur e .

^MMARY OF AGREED PROGRAMMES

  million

1988-89      1989-90 1990-91

Defence +228 +493 +671

The  additions  recognise  the pressures on the programme following

the   end   of   a   period   of   substantial real   growth.     The figures

also incorporate the additions agreed earlier this year for Lynx

helicopter orders for Westland.

2. FCO (Diplomatic Wing) -8 -5 -4

Increased provision for the BBC External Services (current),

the refurbishment of the Old Public Offices and some other minor

items are more than offset by reductions in the capital provision

for the BBC External Services and the estimated cost of the FCO&apos;s

overseas operations.

3. ODA +33 +63 +73

The revised plans provide for the programme to rise slightly

in real terms from its present level. Within the totals the

Foreign Secretary will accommodate the cost of a number of

international initiatives including the interest relief costs

of the IMF&apos;s Structural Adjustment Facility. If the Chancellor&apos;s

debt initiative for Sub -Saharan African gains international

acceptance the consequent costs will be met from the Reserve

or be accepted as agreed bids in subsequent Surveys.

4. EC Contributions +346 +396 +219

In order not to prejudice our position in the negotiations on

future Community financing, the projection assumes the continuation

of the 1.4 per cent VAT ceiling. The sharp increase in the net

contribution in all years is a result of an increase in our share

of gross contributions, reflecting higher customs duties and

levies and a revised forecast of our VAT base, and of a sharp

fall in our forecast share of agricultural receipts.


SECRET

(j^.      I BAP (excluding territories) -223 -208 -101

The main change here is to the estimated cost of CAP support

in the UK including savings on account of CAP reform already

agreed and still subject to negotiation. The projections make

some allowance for future devaluations of the Green Pound but

assume that EC support prices in ecus remain constant on average

in the next three years.

6. Other Agriculture +25 +24 +26

(excluding territories)

Increases   for   ALURE,   the   EC   extensification   scheme,   a variety

of minor programmes and increased estimates for demand-led schemes

are offset in part by savings on capital grants and from increased

_industry funding for R&amp;D and ADAS.

7. Forestry +6 +9 +9

Increases in forestry grants under the ALURE measures.

8. DTI +286 +292 +197

The greater part of the overall increase in the programme is

accounted for by launch aid for Airbus, the transfer of functions

from Department of Employment, and revised costing of demand-led

schemes. The Secretary of State is proposing a restructuring

of regional assistance. This will have an initial cost but will

produce increasing savings by the end of the Survey period. The

allocation between programme and running costs remains to be

decided.

9. ECGD +23 +93 +7 3

These changes mainly result from changed assumptions about interest

rates in the UK and abroad.

10. Energy +26 +27 -11

There are increases for increased estimates of .the cost of ..

redundancy   payments   to   miners    in   the    first   two   years, with


SECRET

^^ductions in the third year for the cost of new accommodation

and for increased payments to the Atomic Energy Authority for

work on decommissioning and nuclear waste management.

11. Employment +42 -4 -59

In the light of the improved unemployment prospect, the Secretary

of State is restructuring his programme to absorb the extra costs

for his department and the MSC of the January employment package

and the withdrawal of income support for school leavers. Measures

will include the closure of the Job Release Scheme and the New

Workers Scheme and savings on the Youth Training Scheme, the

Community Programme and adult training. He is planning also

to privatise Professional and Executive Recruitment and restructure

the Skills Training Agency.

12. Transport +32 +28 +33

The main increase is for the national roads programme, mainly

for a programme of bridge renovation. There is higher gross

capital expenditure by local authorities, offset by higher

receipts.

13. Housing -31 -127 -169

Increased projections of receipts will yield some  1 billion

over the three years. This will allow substantial additions

to gross capital spending in each year, including the setting

up of Housing Action Trusts. The figures shown are after

transferring to DHSS the Housing Benefit costs of projected

increases in rents.

14. Other Environmental Services -130 -3 +2

A higher level of receipts from New Towns and Local Environmental

Services will provide for increased spending on Urban Development

Corporations, the Development Commission, the Countryside

Commission, the Nature Conservancy Council and the Sports Council.


SECRET

15. PSA -22 -59 -56

A combination of higher receipts from disposals and rents and

a small addition to provision in 1988-89 should enable the PSA

to reduce the present backlog of maintenance over the next three

years.

16. Home Office +83 +115 +105

Over 80 per cent of the net addition is accounted for by the

prison building programme following H Committee&apos;s decision in

July that there should be a substantial expansion and acceleration

of the programme.

17. Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department +19 +26 +61

There are increases for court building, running the courts, and

for the phasing in of the permanent scheme of payments on account

for lawyers to which the Government is committed.

18. Education +260 +328 +327

Additions have been made to establish a fund to assist university

restructuring and for the consequences of the academic pay award

following last year&apos;s Survey. There are also increases for capital

work to schools, for science and for the cost to central government

of implementing the national curriculum.

19. Arts and Libraries +36 +47 +53

A significant part of the increase is for new estimates of the

costs of the British Library. For the main programme, a three-

year rolling settlement has been agreed under which the figures

will not be reopened in future Surveys except in specified

circumstances.

20. Health and Personal Social Services   +710 +790 +1230

The    increases    reflect    principally    increased    demand    on the -------

Family Practitioner   Services,   the   growing   cost   of   AIDS,   and the


SECRET

knock-on costs of this year&apos;s Review Body awards. In addition

the health service will benefit from service improvements financed

by the higher dental and sight test charges agreed in September

and by a new programme for generating income from non-NHS use

of hospital goods and services, including franchising. Part

of the overall increase is reserved for the financing of future

Review Body and negotiated pay awards.

21. Social Security +984 +1846 +3090

In spite of the improvement in the unemployment prospect, there

are very large estimating additions to this programme. The main

reasons   for   these   increases   include   larger   numbers   of Income

- .-Support     claimants;       the     reduction---i-n- .... unemployment---.being----

disproportionately among those with lower entitlement to benefit;

and an increase in projected expenditure on sickness and invalidity

benefits. The figures also reflect the agreement to raise benefits

to protect income support claimants against the cost of the 20 per

cent rates contribution. To offset part of these increases,

the Secretary of State has announced the introduction of the

new income-related benefits in April 1988 at levels slightly

below the illustrative rates given in the 1985 Reform White Paper

uprated in line with price movements. He has also announced

that child benefit will not be uprated in April 1988 and that

the housing benefit taper is to be increased to 65 per cent in

1988-89;    the taper will be further increased in 1989-90.

22. Scotland +78        +159 +210

The settlement provides for an increase to Scottish programmes

of industrial assistance so as to allow for a shift in regional

policy in line with the changes proposed for England. On the

Block, the Secretary of State has agreed to offset against his

formula consequentials on other programmes the  71 million by

which the increase agreed in July for his local authority relevant

provision exceeded the formula consequential of the increase

for England.


SECRET

^fc.- Wales +115 +104 +119

The settlement on the Block reflects the formula consequentials

of the agreements on English programmes. There is increased

provision for industrial assistance both to meet estimating

increases in demand-led programmes and to permit a restructuring

of regional policy in line with changes proposed for England.

24. Northern Ireland +94 +113 +146

Apart from the normal operations of the formula, the main increase

is required to meet revised estimates of social security costs

in the province.

25. Chancellor&apos;s Departments +156 +184 +217

Additional resources have been provided for the Revenue Departments

to deal with increases in workload and to strengthen controls

against drug smugglers. Nearly one-third of the overall increase

reflects changes in the estimates of the cost to public expenditure

of providing relief on life assurance premiums and mortgage

interest to non-taxpayers.

25. Nationalised Industries +345 +24 -330

The settlements provide for increases in capital investment

programmes particularly in the Electricity and Water industries.

To help finance these it has been agreed that the profitability

of the electricity industries in England and Wales and in Scotland

should be increased from its present low level. This will involve

an average electricity price increase of about 8*5 per cent next

April. There are substantial savings from a number of other

nationalised industries particularly British Coal and British

Steel.

26. Capital expenditure

Taking   all   the   programmes   together,    the   additions   to planned

capital   expenditure   are   likely   to   be   around   1 billion  in each

of    the    next    two    years,    mostly    for  local   -authorities    and -

nationalised industries.
