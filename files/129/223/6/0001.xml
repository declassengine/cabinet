ECONOMIC PROSPECTS

&lt;^^^ Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer

The economy has been steadily growing at a satisfactory rate for the past

six years.   Witlr^ Mustry competing successfully both at home and abroad

the prospect trfis $ar is for faster Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth

than in recent yeV^BT^and more than I forecast at the time of the Budget.

Unemployment has ^onjAmied to fall while inflation has remained close to

the expected path.^^Jp^far this year, the current account of the balance

of payments has been irp^rodest surplus.    We are also seeing, especially in

the rapid growth of mjrfxfra^turing productivity, some benefits from the

measures taken over the ptfW^seven years to improve supply performance.

2. All this provides an\*n /)i aging picture.    But we clearly cannot

count on the growth rate berrfrvJ^stained at this year&apos;s level over the

Public Expenditure Survey peVToo^2\And there are also evident dangers.

Abroad, the world economy cou^^afe^mpre depressed than now envisaged. At

home, pay settlements badly need/^^&lt;Rall, not least in the public sector.

It is essential that the Governirent^^onstrates its firm commitment to

the financial policies that have fiVoogfifc our present success and which

alone can deliver declining inflatiwf^aajK the continuation of steady

growth in the years ahead. ^~yv

3. Our prudent monetary and fiscal poWcies have stabilised financial

conditions, enabled us to avoid lurches of policy, and increased

confidence in the United Kingdom as a base for investment.    The reduction

of public expenditure as a share of GDP over th -oast four years has been

especially important.    It has enabled us to rrf&amp;uc^jthe Public Sector

Borrowing Requirement despite having to ad jus l\^5,^H*e sharp loss of North

Sea revenues.    But we have failed to make much pr/gr^Bs in reducing the

burden of non-North Sea taxation as a share of GD&lt;X^$t only is this

still well above the figure we inherited, but sinc^M&amp;3&gt;it has actually

been rising. C&lt;^v\

&lt;^&gt;

WORLD ECONOMY &lt;^$^\

4. The most obvious threat to continued steady United K^rJ^J^growth

comes from a weakening of demand and output in other major dwf\reiAped

countries.    Since the fall in oil prices at the beginning or^ltww output

growth in the G7 economies has been disappointing.    Last yearvwa^k^Vorld

demand originated in the developing countries who, as a group, v*ftiack

&lt;^2&gt;


their imports.      More recently many of the strains seem to reflect

\slowness in adjusting to the sharp realignment of exchange rates.

)Vomestic demand in the United States is understandably weakening; while in

,XS rmany and Japan it is not rising fast enough to offset the adverse

^^X^cts of currency appreciation on their exports.    Their loss of export

\a&amp;^Qtts has been made more acute by the  increasing shares taken by the

^yTy^industrialised countries, notably in South-East Asia who, with the

re^nt}accept ion of Taiwan, have held their currencies steady against the

5. I^fti^Lon rates in the major economies have been reduced, much as

expected/V^jJra there are now signs of some progress in correcting the

large cur^nt account imbalances in the United States, Japan and Germany.

The risk ov further turmoil in foreign exchange markets has been reduced -

although not eliminated - by successful co-operation between the G7

countries.    Following the agreement at the Louvre in February,  the G7

countries have s^ec^^ded in stabilising their currencies by a combination

of interventiont^mdvagreater willingness to adapt their monetary

policies.    And trrany&apos;Tyive been some further steps in Germany and even more

in Japan to suppor\(\JAiae tic demand and open markets.    It is vital that

these measures are su^reftned and strengthened.    Further reductions in the

United States budget d&amp;fct&amp;st are also needed.

THE BRITISH ECONOMY

6. A summary of the mos^S&amp;gjzohjL Treasury assessment is shown in the

attached Annex. SsSS&amp;

7. At home we have seen a con&lt;t iranfla*ion of what has by now become a

familiar pattern of strong and sl^pttfyvgrowth coupled with low inflation.

8. A year ago there was concern in s^jrfe quarters at the mild pause in

growth between mid-1985 and mid-1986x^-3^pthe event, despite disappointing

growth abroad,  performance at home hasyVcp^ded expectations.    In the

first quarter of this year GDP was jusrye&amp;^er 4 per cent higher than a year

earlier. &gt;\

9. The prospect  is  for continuing strong growth in 1987, with the

outcome in the year as a whole likely to be clos 3^ o 4 per cent than the

3 per cent predicted at Budget time.    Domesticf/em^pd growth is balanced,

with fixed investment rising in line with the gp2to^5^bkf consumers&apos;

expenditure.    With growth in 1987 above the trendfcf&gt;rfecent years, it

would not be surprising if the growth rate fell babk^^wittle next year.

10. The recent strong performance of output has conts^^CW to a further

rise in employment and in turn to the fastest recorded^avL^n

unemployment since the War.    This welcome fall in unemplqraJejSK to below

the three million mark has occurred at the same time as p^du/piyity

growth in manufacturing has been exceptionally high by hisroi^rt^w

standards.    Indeed increased industrial efficiency has been &gt;^lTN sJ  ntial

factor in the greatly improved unemployment prospect.    If over^j^wygrpwth


continues at a steady and sustainable rate, even if somewhat lower than

this year, there is every likelihood that the fall in unemployment will

,   also continue.

) HI.    We have always known that the United Kingdom, as a major oil

^ producer, would not benefit as much from the fall in oil prices as the

vCv^r major economies.    The necessary fall in sterling during 1986 largely

\&gt;o*yklet the beneficial impact on inflation of the lower oil prices,

ifcr^wr, we are still on course to achieve the Budget forecast of 4 per

cWfti^^rflation in the fourth quarter of this year, and the outcome could

wel^be^ little lower.    Nonetheless, this remains uncomfortably above the

averaj &lt; pete in most other major economies.    It is essential that

inflar^Sjy^s kept firmly on a downward path over the medium term.

12. So lower inflation has not been adequately reflected in lower

pay settlements.   The deceleration of private sector pay settlements in

1986 appears to have ended:    indeed if anything they may have begun to

edge up.    Some public sector settlements - notably by local authorities -

could also set /invmfor tunate precedent for the private sector and will

make it more dr&lt; f-ic)i4-  to control public finances.    Pay increases need to

be lower if the ha4^\on fall in unemployment is to continue.

13. The prospects  $*^cj   current account of the balance of payments now

look a little better QJm^khey did at the time of the Budget, and the

estimate of last year^ &lt;&amp;r*cit has been revised down almost to zero.

Over the past year British^ronroanies have competed successfully in the

home and international ma^K^fTsu   In spite of subdued prospects for world

trade and buoyant activity^^r^tfoe it now looks as if the current account

this year will show a smalle^vvTlf&amp;cit than the Budget forecast of

 2i billion, or half of one pW&gt;^t of GDP.

14. Since the Louvre agreement %*fvap&amp;s the end of February, sterling has

generally been very steady.    Indee^r^wing April and May there was a

pronounced tendency for the pound to-^^rengthen.    This was contained by

reducing interest rates and interven^jfi^ln the foreign exchange markets on

an unprecedented scale.    As a result, Ypfe^kchange rate has stayed within

a very narrow range over the past 4-5 mraxhs.    This in turn has

strengthened confidence within industry.v

15. Nevertheless, financial markets are closely watching the behaviour of

the economy, and in particular the outlook f or/^*? iation.    They will also

be on the look-out for any signs of a loosenir( o&amp;7the rigorous financial

policies that have brought our current success/^^Y^ys vital that we

maintain the firm control of public expenditure Secretary,
