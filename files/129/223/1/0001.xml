V^S^iDCASTING:   INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT OF PROGRAMME STANDARDS

Mrara&apos;andum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department

The purpose of this paper is to consider the proposal that the

Broadcasting Comp^^ints Commission (BCC) should be replaced or

strengthened in//ur^Broadcasting Bill and given new responsibilities in

relation to progxaswrtg^standards on radio and television.    This would

provide some response iJo public concern about taste and decency generally,

including the portrs^i^f violence.    The proposal would,  if acceptable,

need further work, bw^pa^obvious reasons an urgent decision of principle

is required. C^VVv

BACKGROUND

2. At present the BCC&apos; s reia^^V confined to adjudication upon

complaints,  brought by the  inv^^CT^party,  of unjust or unfair treatment or

invasion of privacy.    The Annex^^^es a brief account of the history of

the idea that the BCC should also/)2wleader and comment on the broad issue

of programme standards, whether vn LpKJ^vidual programmes or generally. In

brief the idea was considered, butv je^*ed by the Annan Committee (1977);

adopted by the last Labour GovernmerH^j^ks 1978 White Paper; but again

rejected by the present Government ii^\6^Zfinz up the Broadcasting Bill

1980 which led to the establishment of yn^ffCC as now constituted.

CURRENT PROPOSAL ^

3. The BCC has worked well since its inception Jji 1981,  though its task

is relatively narrow.    It would be possible to ^rengthen the membership

of the BCC (or to replace it with a new body) tv^-4v ^arge in addition a

wider task of keeping under review programme stand&apos;ardajon taste, decency

and portrayal of violence and the way broadcastersVE^^pf^id to complaints

about them.    It might publicise its views and commen^^Aa^occasion

demanded,  and in any event be required to make an anni/| i^p^por t.    It would

not be given formal power to overrule the decisions of ^fetfi^lnioadc asters.

ARGUMENTS FOR WIDENING THE BCC&apos; S ROLE

4. The advantage of the approach proposed above is that it^oMw provide

a mechanism to deal with the evident and recurrent public conc^rj^about

broadcasting standards.    Without disturbing the necessary constM&apos;wp^nal

independence of the broadcasters,  it would provide a body to whidir tb^v


public could turn, which would articulate, on a continuing basis, an

^.independent judgment on these matters,  a judgment  independent both of the

&apos;ybroadcasters and of Government.    As such it could certainly do something

channel public anxiety, and encourage the broadcasters to observe the

/^^etidards expected of them.

&lt;S^p^SITS AGAINST THE PROPOSAL

5. v^tf^he other hand it will be argued, as was accepted by the Annan

CommitJS^e,  that this wider role for the BCC would undermine the authority

of the^b^Slcasting organisations,  perhaps diminish their own sense of

responsrbiTi^y, and lead to an unhelpful confusion of roles. The

arrangem&amp;vr proposed might be welcomed by some at first, but could well be

followed       disappointment and demands for the BCC to be given &quot;teeth&quot;.

But if the BCC were given formal powers over the broadcasters the position

of the latter as trustees for the public interest would be hopelessly

compromised. /^&quot;^\

FINANCE AND EURCWA^^OMMUNITY IMPLICATIONS

6. The BCC, whicn*~S^ca:esent costs about  0.25 million per annum, is

financed by contributyya^/^from the broadcasters.    It is envisaged that an

enlarged role, which in&amp;ajC\k &gt;ub 1 e its costs, would be funded in the same

way.    It would not be easVjfe^ assess the value for money obtained by this

additional expenditure.   ^X^psSave no European Community implications.

CONCLUSION

7. The idea of strengthening^t^J^YBCC and widening its remit has

attractive features and might be Ar^cl^med by responsible opinion. There

are pitfalls which need to be examip^et^pnd refined further before

legislation is prepared.    I seek my^cp^^agues&apos; agreement to my setting in

hand work for this purpose.    In the w^aajE^me our public posture should

recall what we have done,  in particulaiyyncaugh the establishment of the

BCC in 1980; acknowledge that its remi&amp;^^prelatively narrow;  say that we

see advantage in giving it,  or some replacement body,  a wider role to

monitor programme standards generally on the lines set out above; and that

we will work out a specific proposal for approval by Parliament.

VOv/\ WIDENING THE ROLE OF THE BCC: BACKGROUND

1. Under^the^iroadcasting Act 1981 the Broadcasting Complaints Commission

(BCC) is esta^ shed to adjudicate upon complaints, brought by the injured

party, of unj5j5^op&gt; unfair treatment or invasion of privacy.   It must make its

findings known, &lt;&amp;m may give directions to the broadcaster concerned to ensure

that these are adequately publicised.

2. The BCC was originaTly)j)roposed by the Annan Committee (Report 1977

Cmnd 6753).   The Annan l^j^ffij^made several relevant proposals:

(i) That there should be/^rablic Enquiry Board for Broadcasting which

would have public meetings ev^rV seven years to review programme

standards.   This somewhat cutnoers^me arrangement has not been

implemented, partly on the grotn^s^hat ad hoc committees could better

meet the need. &quot; ^^(y^

(ii) That senior programme makers and^ffla^ers of the broadcasting

-    authorities&quot; should meet periodically w^w^members of the public to be

exposed to their views.   This has been immje^ented and over 100 public

meetings have been held by the IBA and BBC^ince 1977.

(iii) That there should be an independent Commissf^f\(to replace the

internal bodies established by the BBC and IBA respwptyely) to consider

complaints of unjust or unfair treatment or of inva&amp;^oj/pk privacy. This

&quot;became the BCC. ^^^^^&gt;

-(iv) That this Commission should not deal also with complai^jte^ttom the

- general public about taste, content or standards of individuatW^Sjammes

~     or programmes in general.   It took the view that &apos;complaints abt5uv)&amp;\e

programmes, general or individual, are matters for the authoritie&lt;s&apos;y^/U


3. The White Paper produced by the last Labour Government in 1978

^&apos;Broadcasting&apos; Cmnd 7294) accepted Annan&apos;s proposal for an independent

^4ftmmission to look at complaints of unfair treatment and invasions of

^^vacy.   The Commission it envisaged would however have gone beyond Annan by

a &gt;$5^&gt;nsidering and commenting on &apos;issues arising from complaints of a more

gen x X/nature relating to programme standards and on the broadcasting

autho^mjjk&apos; response to such complaints&apos;.   It envisaged that the Commission&apos;s

role wcrfrlyg^k to comment on general issues and trends - for example, in its

Annual Rejjoj*^ rather than concern itself with particular complaints and

particular p,p(^?ammes (save, of course, in respect of complaints of unfairness

and privacy)&quot;^v^^

4. When the present Government drew up its Broadcasting Bill (1980) it

deliberately rejected thi L wider role for the BCC; and accordingly the

legislation restricted( t v&gt; adjudicating on complaints concerning unfairness

and invasions of privacy.//tHh Government at that time accepted the view that

a wider remit would lead tb~^tonfusion of role and compromise the position of

the broadcasting authorities ^feJ^Xprimary responsibility it is to maintain

programme standards. yy^\ -

5. Since then the Government&apos;s resnon^e^o proposals that the BCC should be

given a wider role has been to ernphasi^e^hat the broadcasting authorities are

are appointed precisely to act as truste^s^i^Xthe public interest over matters

of programme standards, and that another bedy&gt;^buld displace or duplicate

their role. &lt;^^&gt; -  - .


public hearings in connection with any significant changes which it is minded to

make to the franchise areas. In considering such changes the Authority will

also be required to pay special attention to links of community interest. The

precise procedures for public hearings will need further consideration and

consultation, but it will be the intention to keep them as simple as possible.

Broadcasting Complaints Commission

77.  The Annan Committee considered that the present arrangements for

dealing with complaints, the BBC&apos;s Programme Complaints Commission and

the IBA&apos;s Complaints Review Board, do not command public confidence,

though they made it clear that they were not suggesting that the existing com-

plaints bodies were other than scrupulous, judicious and impartial in reaching

their decisions.  The Government&apos;agrees and welcomes the Annan Committee&apos;s

recommendation that an independent Broadcasting Complaints Commission

should be established to consider complaints against all the broadcasting

authorities of misrepresentation or unjust or unfair treatment in broadcast

programmes and that the Commission should also consider complaints about

invasion of privacy during the preparation of programmes.   The recommenda-

tion commands widespread support, and provision for the establishment of such

a Commission will be included in the Government&apos;s forthcoming legislation.

The Government has it in mind, however, to enlarge in some respects the func-

tions envisaged by the Annan Committee for the proposed Commission.

Complaints of misrepresentation and unjust or unfair treatment

78.  As regards the Commission&apos;s quasi-judicial functions in relation to

complaints of misrepresentation, unjust or unfair treatment or invasion of

privacy, it will be for the Commission itself to decide whether a particular

programme constituted misrepresentation or unjust or unfair treatment within

its terms of reference, but it is envisaged that the interpretation should not be

narrowly or legalistically confined to cases of misrepresenting the words or

deeds of a particular individual or company and should be extended to cover :

programmes which, taken as a whole, grossly misrepresent or traduce people&apos;s \

actions and motives.  The Commission will consider such complaints only if

they have been first put to the appropriate broadcasting authority and the

complainant is dissatisfied with the authority&apos;s response.  The Commission \

will therefore send any complaint of this kind which it receives direct from the  

complainant, to the authority concerned, and it will receive a report from the -

authority on the action taken.  If the complainant is dissatisfied with the reply

he has received from the authority, the Commission will proceed to consider

the complaint.  The Commission&apos;s adjudication will be published and it will

be able, where it judges this to be appropriate, to require the broadcasting

authority concerned to publish and/or broadcast that adjudication. The

Commission will have discretion to refuse to consider a complaint of this kind

if it considers it to be frivolous or malicious.

The legal waiver

79. Under the existing arrangements for dealing with complaints a person

who wishes his complaint to be considered by the BBC&apos;s Programme Complaints

* in


Commission is required, and a person who wishes to have his complaint con-

sidered by the IBA&apos;s Complaints Review Board may be asked, to waive his

right to institute legal proceedings in connection with the complaint. The

Annan Committee considered that the waiver was an unjustifiable interference

with individual rights, but suggested only that the question of the waiver should

be looked at closely before the Broadcasting Complaints Commission was

established. On the question of the legal waiver required in certain circum-

stances by the Press Council some members of the Royal Commission on the

Press* were firmly of the view that, although it might be reasonable for the

consideration of a complaint to be postponed until after pending legal pro-

ceedings had been concluded, the waiver was not justified and should be done

away with. Other members believed that, although the objections in principle

to the waiver were strong and the theoretical arguments in its favour uncon-

vincing, there was a practical argument for the waiver in that its abolition might

cause some editors to refuse to co-operate with the Press Council on some

complaints. The Press Council&apos;s waiver was also discussed in the Report of

the Younger Committee on Privacyf: they concluded that, although the waiver

might seem obnoxious, it was an unavoidable feature of the Press Council&apos;s

complaints system. They noted, moreover, that it was a common feature of

binding arbitration proceedings.

80. The arguments for and against the legal waiver are finely balanced.

On the one hand it can be said that the right to have a complaint considered by

an independent Broadcasting Complaints Commission established by law

should be regarded as an alternative, rather than an addition, to the ordinary

legal remedies, particularly since an adjudication by the Commission will be

published and, in some cases, broadcast. And it can be argued that a com-

plainant should not be able to use a favourable adjudication, or information

which he might not otherwise have obtained, as a basis for legal proceedings

against the relevant authority or the persons who made the programme in

question, especially since this could affect their willingness to co-operate fully

with the Commission. On the other hand it can be said that the proposed

complaints procedure is designed to give the public a new and important right

to an independent investigation, and that there is no reason why the broadcasting

authorities, as public bodies, should seek the protection of a waiver, thus denying

individuals the right to take legal proceedings. It is perhaps less clear that

there should be no protection for the individual programme maker. Before

reaching a final conclusion on the question of the waiver the Government will

wish to consider comments on these paragraphs of this White Paper.

Other matters within the Commission&apos;s remit

81. The handling of complaints of a more general nature about programmes

(concerning, for instance, the excessive portrayal of violence, failure to observe

the requirement of due impartiality in the treatment of controversial matters,

or an alleged breach of a code of conduct promulgated by a broadcasting

authority) raises rather different issues from those relating to complaints of

misrepresentation or unjust or unfair treatment. The Annan Committee

considered that complaints relating to the taste, content or standard of individual

tCmnd 5012 (July 1972).

29


programmes or of programmes in general were properly matters for the broad-

casting authorities, and the Committee made various proposals (eg for public

hearings) designed to ensure that the authorities were more open to such

complaints than they had been in the past.   In Chapter 10 the Government

comments on the obligations of the broadcasting authorities in relation to

programme standards, for example, as respects the portrayal of violence and due

impartiality.   Complaints of this kind amount to many thousands over a year:

they can range from the expression of an individual and highly personal view

to the expression of views which seem to command widespread public support.

Moreover the existence of an independent Broadcasting Complaints Commission

may be expected to encourage the public to direct complaints of these more

general kinds to it.   No single organisation could respond quickly to complaints

of this kind without a large and expensive staff to monitor programmes and

deal with correspondence.   Moreover, if the Commission were to attempt to i

substitute its judgment for that of the broadcasting authorities as regards the j

taste, content or standards of individual programmes, it would come close to

assuming part probably an increasing part of their responsibilities for the ;

day to day conduct of broadcasting.   On the other hand, the Government

believes that there is public concern about some general issues, to which the

,   broadcasting authorities have not always responded adequately.  It considers

,  therefore that there would be merit in giving the Broadcasting Complaints

; Commission, in addition to its responsibilities for adjudicating on individual j

complaints of misrepresentation or unfair treatment, some responsibility for j

reviewing, and commenting from time to time, on the nature of, and trends

I    revealed in, the other complaints it will undoubtedly receive about failure to

1 ;  observe acceptable standards by the broadcasting authorities.   However, the j

Commission&apos;s role here will be to comment on general issues and general trends j

rather than concern itself with particular complaints and particular programmes, j

82. The Government therefore proposes that the Commission should be

able to consider, and comment in its annual report, on issues arising from

complaints of a more general nature relating to programme standards, and on

the broadcasting authorities&apos; response to such complaints.  Where such &apos;;

complaints are received direct by the Commission it will therefore pass them to &apos;

the appropriate broadcasting authority, which will reply direct to the com- j

i plainant, sending a copy of its reply to the Commission.

i

83. The Broadcasting Complaints Commission will consist of a chairman, i

and perhaps four to eight members in the first instance, who will be appointed

by the Home Secretary.   It will employ such staff as are necessary. The

^Commission will be financed from contributions from the BBC, the IBA and the

OBA, and it will decide, subject to the approval of the Home Secretary, what

&apos; &apos;_/&apos; procedures to adopt for the purpose of carrying out its functions.   The aim

must be to ensure that these procedures are kept as simple and informal as ,

possible.   The Commission will be required to publish an annual report giving j

an account of the complaints of misrepresentation and unfair treatment it has i

received over the year and of the adjudications it has made on them; the report !

will also contain a review of the more general complaints received during the i

year and the issues these raise.  The Commission&apos;s report will be laid before ]

Parliament.   The Government also proposes to require the broadcasting &apos;

30


authorities to publish in their annual reports information about the volume and

nature of the complaints they have received during the year and about the

action they have taken in consequence. Parliament and the public will be able

to judge from the authorities&apos; and the Commission&apos;s annual reports how far the

authorities&apos; obligations in relation to programme standards have been fulfilled.

Annual Reports

84. It is central to the accountability of the broadcasting authorities that

they should produce annual reports for presentation by the Home Secretary to

Parliament. Information about the volume and the nature of complaints about

broadcast programmes and any action taken in consequence is one of the items

which the Government considers should be included in these reports, but there

are others which will be common to all broadcasting authorities. These are

dealt with in the appropriate places in Part II of the White Paper and are sum-

marised in paragraph 98. It is the intention that all the reports should be avail-

able at much the same time, that is, as soon as possible after the end of the

financial year, on 31 March.

Statutory codification of the constitutional arrangements common to all broad-

casting authorities

85. A number of the basic constitutional arrangements which govern

broadcasting in this country are the same for the BBC and the IBA and will also

   apply to the OBA.  These are discussed in Chapters 9 and 10. Moreover,

several of the proposals in this chapter, for example that the authorities should

conduct public hearings to ascertain the views of the public on the services for

which they are responsible, will be applicable in the case of all three authorities.

I   The Government considers that Parliament should have the opportunity when

I!   the forthcoming broadcasting legislation is debated to consider and approve these

I   common constitutional arrangements for all three broadcasting authorities at the

1  same time.  This presents no difficulty in relation to the IBA which is, and the

OBA which will be, bodies created and regulated by statute.  The constitutional

arrangements for the BBC, however, are set out in the Corporation&apos;s Royal

Charter, and also in its Licence and Agreement and related prescribing mem-

oranda.  It is customary for a draft of the Royal Charter for which the Govern-

ment intends to apply to be presented to Parliament, but the Charter itself is not

subject to any formal Parliamentary procedure.   The Licence and Agreement

requires the approval of the House of Commons, not however because of the

important constitutional arrangements which it contains, but because it makes

provision for the grant-in-aid for the BBC&apos;s External Services and is therefore a

contract which is not binding unless approved by a Resolution of the House of

Commons (Standing Order No 96).

86. As indicated in Chapter 5, the Government considers that the BBC

should continue to be a Royal Charter body. It believes, however, that the

constitutional arrangements which are common to all three broadcasting

authorities should be dealt with by statute. The forthcoming broadcasting

legislation will therefore contain provisions which will be common to the BBC,

the IBA and the OBA on the following matters:
