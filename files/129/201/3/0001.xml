DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 53 COPY NO 805 May 1978CABINETWEIGHTS AND MEASURESNote by the Secretary of State for the environment. This note sets out my reasons fcr believing that wl should not and need not make the use of imperial measures unlawful for many of the goods which people buy every day.    It arises from oar discussion on 27th April;summing up, the Prime Minister said the Cabinet recognised that thebalance of practical arguments was in favour of continuing with themetrication programme, but the instinctive dislike of many people for compulsory orders which would prevent the use of familiar measures had also to be recognised (CM(78) 16th Conclusions, Minute 1).THE POSITION SO FAR2. To a very large extent, industry, commerce and the professions havealready changed over to using metric measures without any compulsion. Intheir working lives, many people have adapted to this.    In the shops, somepre-packed goods are now sold in metric packs (although with the imperialequivalents shown);   while many others are sold in imperial measures withthe metric equivalents marked alongside.    But metrication has not yet had much impact on people&apos;s private lives either because metric and imperialunits are still being used in parallel or because onl/ imperial measures arein use (as in the case of unpacked meat, vegetables, fish, fruit and cheese).The public have certainly shown no enthusiasm for metrication. Theirreluctant tolerance of it arises, I believe, because it has had so little effecton them so far and most importantly, because there has been no element of compulsion.THE NEXT STAGE3. But the next stage in the metrication programme will change this.It proposes that, in the course of 1981, we should make it unlawful to useimperial measures for the sale of many everyday articles; for example,this would mean that people would not be able to buy meat, fish, fruit,cheese, potatoes and other vegetables in the measures they know.    They willbft forced to use metric units.   They will see no benefit for themselves in this.1
A lot of them will be confused;  many wiU fear that they will be cheated. Tosay the lease, an upsurge of public i\nease would be understandable. the target for this dissatisfaction will be the Government.    That is the course onwhich compulsion will set us.A SELECTIVE APPROACH4. I believe we have underestimated the strength of people&apos;s attachmentto the old measures.    There are cases - such as manufactured goods andsome pre-packed foods where there is an important export potential - whersthe arguments in favour of metrication are genuinely overwhelming, and here the logic of adapting to the accepted international standard speaks for itself.    The conversion has already happened without the need for compul-sion by law.    In other cases the arguments are not sufficient.    We haveconceded this in the case of the pint of beer, the mile and the pint of milk.We were right to single these out from the start as exceptions.    I believe itwould be both right and feasible now to add to these exceptions a range ofother unpacked goods in everyday demand - notably meat, vegetables, fish,cheese and fruit.    There is nothing sacrosanct about the 1981 date for theirmetrication suggested in the April 1977 Report of the Department of prices and Consumer Protection.    And I believe there is absolutely no case for ourattempting to outlaw the use of imperial measures and bring the machineryof the criminal law to bear on those who want to do no more than to buy andsell these basic domestic commodities in th** measures they are used to.5. It should be noted that our own proposals go well beyond what isrequired of us by European Economic Community (e.c.) law on thestandardisation of weights and measures.    The Council Directive of27 July 1976 stipulates no more than that, by the end of 1979, we should&quot;review&quot; the use of such vital units as the mile, foot, inch, pound, ounceand pint; it does not set any terminal date on their lawful use (the relevanrextract - article 1(4) and chapter D of the annex - from e.c. Directive76/770 is attached).    In fact, it would be quite practicable to allow the dualsystem to operate far beyond 1981.    The risks of confusion in retaining the dual system are often overstated and, in any event, do not outweigh the disadvantages of compulsion.    In my view we should make clear now that we intend to retain for the foreseeable future the units of imperial measurelisted in Annex D to the Directive.conclusion. To sum up, my argument is that opposition to metrication ha3 beenunderestimated because progress so far has had little direct impact onpeople&apos;s everyday purchases.    There are very strong reasons for avoidingcompulsion in this area.    We have recognised this already in the case of thepint and the mile.    We now need to recognise it in the case of a wida range of other goods - notably, those which are weighed out in the shops. Weshould pursue, therefore, a more selective policy, and above all we must2
eschew criminal sanctions.    People cannot see any good reason why theyshould be forced to adopt the new syctem for their ordinary domestic tran-section.   It would be intolerable - and I believe unenforceable - to attemptto prohibit the use of these familiar everyday measures.    We have already had clear warning that to do so would arouse fierce resentment, and in my view the resentment would be understandable and to a large extent justified.P department of the Environment5 May 19783
