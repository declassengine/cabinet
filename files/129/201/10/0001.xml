IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(78) 60 COPY NO 8022 May 1978CABINETDISCUSSION DOCUMENT ON THE ELDERLY:  COMMITMENT to eventual EQUALISATION OF PENSION AGESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Services and theMinister for Social security the Home and Social Affairs Committee (HS) has considered and approved for publication a Discussion Document on the elderly in our society.P0wever one matter is still unresolved, pending consideration in full Cabinet.^pter 3 of the Document, on Pension Age, is attached:  it refers to theResent retirement ages of 65 for men and 60 for women, and discussesya*ious options for bringing the standard ages together and for allowing the^dividual a greater measure of choice in the age at which he or she retires^d begins to draw a state pension.We were invited by the Committee to put a memorandum to Cabineteeking guidance on whether the Document should say, as the last sentence0* paragraph 3. 3 now does, that the Government regard a common pension-^iLjpr both sexes as being, in principle, the right long-term solution. In^Ur view there are a number of reasons for the Government to come out inVour of eventual equality:-i. &quot;Our present position - an unwillingness to consider anychange in pension age of 65 for men and 60 for women - is bothinflexible and unpopular.    Pressure for some change is widespread,and the best way to head off the pressure for men to retire at 60 isto accept in principle the case at least for a common retirement age.This brings in the argument for moving from 65 for men and 60 forwomen to, say, 63 for both&quot;.ii. A commitment to eventual equalisation has been asked for bythe Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) who are the body whomthe Government have set up to advise them on sex discrimination issues.The Government&apos;s record on sex equality is a good one: discussion onthe achievement of more equal treatment for men and women is a feature of the Supplementary Benefits Review (which is now before HS)and acceptance of the EOCs view that there should be a long-termcommitment to sex equality in retirement would continue this momentum
3.iii. The draft European Economic Community Directive on equal treatment in social security does not cover pension ages atpresent but makes clear in its preamble that it may be extended todo so.    In the debate on the Directive a number of our supportersmade clear that they would welcome progress in this direction.iv. The Occupational Pensions Board have reported to the effectthat equality of treatment for men and women in occupational pensionarrangements will be greatly eased once the state has taken the leadin moving towards a common pension age.v. On the other hand, failure to accept equalisation as the rightlong-term answer would be taken as implying that the Government sawsome inherent merit in the present five year differential in pensionages.    Ministers are already on record as saying that this has nobasis in logic, and it would be unfortunate if we found ourselves in theposition of attempting to defend it as a necessary feature of pensionarrangements indefinitely.vi. The Conservatives are on record as favouring equality inpension ages, and have called for inter-Party talks to draw up an agreed timetable.    If the Government appear to be committed to maintaining the status quo, the Opposition may see political advantage in presenting themselves as the new champions of equality.vii. The chapter as a whole does not under-state the difficulties inthe way of achieving equality of pension ages.    It stresses both thecost of paying pensions universally at age 60 and the political difficulties of requiring women to wait for a full pension beyond thatage.    But, by making clear that a sensible long-term policy for retirement can only be evolved if these difficulties are faced, it willcompel the EOC and other commentators to face up to the financialand social implications of what they are proposing, and will deterthem from claiming that equality can be swiftly or easily achieved.For all these reasons we invite Cabinet to endorse Chapter 3 in its^re8ent form, including the proposed statement in it that the government accept it as right in principle to seek a long-term solution which allows forComrnon pension age.D ES OUePartment of Health and Social Security19 May 1978
Chapter 3AGE&apos;1   The age for retirement from regular employment has become^reasingly formalised in this country, in that most people^e o^  compulsorily retired at the minimum state pension ages -men and 60 for women.   Some occupational pension schemes^vide for retirement before these ages.   Chart F shows the^eadily decreasing proportion of men who work beyond minimumsta-te pension age.This rigid pattern of retirement suits some people butothers. Some are ready for retirement at the set ages:others would either prefer to retire earlier or wouldUlilngly remain at work for longer.   Early retirement isconunon goal among people.whose health is declining or who^     lr* strenuous occupations.    It is attractive if backed uppension arrangements, but it is a quite different^   er if it involves accepting a substandard pension and thusInduced living standard in retirement.   Many people, on thefiand, are not interested in early retirement and place their^  a&amp;is on having the opportunity to stay on at work until a datetj^    ir own choosing.    As the health of the population improvesPreS ^Vou^) mav grow in numbers, possibly even giving rise to^ssure such as has developed in the USA to root out &quot;ageism&quot;g    0u-tlaw compulsory retirement under the age of 70.    There isPort on all sides, therefore, for a more flexible approach toensi** ages.^ the same time there has been in recent years a heightenedSs of the disparity between the pension ages for men andWomen, and an increasing number of proposals for greater equality0      1 them in the arrangements for retirement as in other aspects0      e&apos;   The occupational pensions movement have put forward a numberaimed at the eventual equalisation of pension ages.f0f ^Ual Opportunities Commission, who have been studying the issuefloc SOnie *ime, have recently published a valuable consultationxt * which asks for a firm Government commitment to the objectiveSing the Pension Age, EOC, Manchester 1978RESTRICTED

RESTRICTEDof a common pension age for both sexes.   The Government accept that it is right in principle to seek a long-term solutionalong these lines.3.4 The simplest v/ay in which equalisation could be achieved wouldbe by enabling men, as well as women, to draw their state pensionsat age 60.   This is a long-standing policy of the TUC, and it would bring male workers in general into line with those professions which already have 60 as their accepted retirement age.   But its cost would be large.   An estimated  500 million would be needed for eachof the five annual reductions which would be necessary to bring down the men&apos;s   pension     age from 65 - some  2^ billion a year in total -assuming that the process was accompanied by a return to a level of full employment at which no significant number of the vacanciescreated could be filled from among the unemployed.3.5 If present levels of unemployment persisted over the period(hiring which the pension age was being lowered the cost would be significantly less.   More job opportunities would be made availableto younger workers, and some savings in unemployment and supple-fcentary benefit would be secured.   The immediate effect on uneraploy-&amp;ent would not be great however and, even in the long-term, it islikely that a significant number of the vacancies created by menretiring earlier would not be filled.   On the other hand it seemsessential that a long-term, and irreversible, reform should becosted on the expectation that, in the medium and long run,Policies to restore full employment will succeed.3.6 The costings assume that the pattern of retirement between theHew pension age of 60 and 65 would be the same as it is now between65 and 70.   They reflect the cost to central government funds byv*y of the additional retirement and supplementary pensions whichvould be paid; the savings in social security benefits which would otherwise have been payable and the effect on contribution and taxAvenue.   They are based on the present level of pensions, so thatftone of the money would go towards raising pensions - nor is anyaccount taken of the cost of entitling men under 65 to the emerg-ing benefits of the new pension scheme.   Once those higher pensionsVere generally available, payment of them to men at 60 instead of^5 v/ould almost double the long-term cost of lowering the pensiona8e.   it follows that   even a phased reduction in men!s pension18
RESTRICTEDage would be a very expensive proposition and, though 60 as a commonpension age might remain an eventual objective, there could be little prospect of achieving it quickly unless other social prioritieswere set aside,3.7 In these circumstances it has been suggested - notably by theEqual Opportunities Commission - that it would be more realisticto think in terms of equalising the pension age, in the first instance,at some point between the ages of 60 and 65.   The EOC have putforward - not as a firm recommendation, but for discussion and further study - the possibility of a common pension ageof 63.   A proposal on these lines would allow some part, atleast, of the cost of earlier pensions for men to be met by post-postponing their payment to v/omen.   But, even as a transitional measure,it raises the fundamental issue of whether it would be justifiable to deprive women of the right, which they have enjoyed for nearly40 years, to a full state pension at age 60.   Clearly, it would bean unacceptable breach of faith if full pensions were withheld from those who expect to receive   them in a few years1 time. Atthe other extreme, to maintain existing rights until every 16-yearold girl now in the work-force and contributing for a pension at60 had reached that age would rule out the prospect of anychange on this basis until   v/ell into the 21st century.13.8 The approach discussed in the last paragraph also has implicatefor the introduction of greater flexibility into retirement.    If, in line with the EOCs thinking, the age at which v/omen can receivefull pensions were raised above 60, it might nevertheless seem reaso1&quot;to continue to allow for retirement at that age with less than fullentitlement.    (From next year, each year of postponement of retire^--&quot;&quot;beyond the minimum age will increase eventual entitlement by about 7*.per cent, and it would be possible for a comparable reduction to be-in the pensions of those who chose to retire early.)   It would not?however, seem appropriate that only women should be entitled to ta^ea reduced-rate pension before the standard retirement age: onceequality of pension ages had been established it would be naturalfor men to become eligible to retire on the same terms at any agefrom 60 onwards.   This v/ould allow for much greater flexibility in making individual provision for retirement.
3.9   On the other hand, the Government would not favour introducingarrangements of this kind if the pensions of those who retired earlywere generally below the supplementary benefit level: this would onlyincrease the extent of poverty and of reliance on means-testing in old age.   But the build-up of rights to the new earnings-related pensions(based ultimately on the contributors 20 best years of earnings) will mean a steady progress towards levels of benefit from which it will bepossible, without making people reliant on supplementary benefit,to make a deduction on account of early retirement. The longerthe time taken to reach a common pension age with provision forflexible early retirement, and the greater, therefore, the buildup of the new additional pension, the larger the number of people who could forgo their full pension entitlement under the new schemeand retire early without losing the prospect of an adequate livingstandard in old age.3.10  Thus comments are sought on the possibility of an eoualisationof men!s and women&apos;s pension ages at whatever age can be affordedbetween 60 and 65; pensions at less than the new scheme15 full level would, however, remain available to women - and become available toaen - on retirement at any time between 60 and the new standard age.If this approach finds favour, views are also invited on the time-scale over v/hich it would be appropriate for such developments totake place.3.11 But the arrangements for retirement are not solely a matterof the structure and financing of state pensions;    such changes would have a major impact on employment and retirement policythroughout the economy.   At present a firm or industry which allowsits employees to retire before the state pension age has itselfto meet the cost of providing for their earlier retirement! indeed,in the Governments view it is right that this cost should be borneby the employer and employees concerned, rather than by the generaltaxpayer or national insurance contributor.   In the long term,arrangements for flexible retirement within the s tate scheme wouldBake it easier for individual firms or industries to introduce earlierretirement provisions.   Meanwhile there are already some circumstances in which s tate money is available to assist those who give up workbefore the standard pension age.   People who do so because of ill-health can draw a national insurance invalidity pension at the
RESTRICTEDretirement pension rate;   under the new scheme these invaliditypensions will begin to contain an earnings-related element based,in the long run, on earnings in the contributor^ best 20 years.A more recent development, introduced in the light of the need toprovide job opportunities for younger workers, is the Job ReleaseAllowance which can be claimed by those who voluntarily chooseretirement within a year of the state pension age.    It is forconsideration whether, in&quot; advance of any long-term changesin the direction of flexible retirement, more should bedone to accommodate those individuals whose working lives,either through choice or because of conditions in their particular employment, come to an end before the standardretirement age.3.12 Finally any changes in retirement ages, such a shave been discussed in this chapter, would have substantialrepercussions on occupational pension schemes and on thearrangements for contracting-out of the new additional statepension.   It v/ould also be necessary to make sure that theopportunity given to employees to retire early with less thana full pension was not used to force them out of employmentearlier than they wished.    The economic implications of changing the proportion of the population   in active employmentduring the next century would also be important.   In this context, future trends in birth rates - and hence in the agestructure of the population - v/ould be relevant.    All these willrequire careful and detailed study before major structural change*in state provision could be introduced, and we v/ould welcomecomments on them.3.13 In the light of all this, the Government would also likeviews on other things that might be done to make provisions fogretirement more flexible.21RESTRICTED
