^ENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78)6Z COPY NO23 May 1978CABINETKMOS SEMICONDUCTORS LIMITEDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for industry i was asked by Cabinet last week (CM(78) 19th Conclusions, Minute 5) toAd discussions with the companies known to be interested in establishingManufacturing capacity for silicon chips in the United Kingdom in order to learne scale and firmness of their plans and the extent of Government support theyWould seek.    I have now consulted the General Electric Company Limited (G.C)the International Telephone and Telegraph Company Limited (ITT) in strictCOr*fidence, and have summarised below the answers I received and my ^elusion s.    I had seen Sir Leslie Murphy, the Chairman of the Nationalhterprise Board (not), beforehand and secured his agreement to my tellinge companies concerned that the not had under consideration a proposal fore manufacture of computer memory chips.Sir Arnold Weinstock, the Managing Director of G.C, confirmed thatEC was well advanced in negotiations with the United States FairchildOrporation for a joint venture, of which G.C would own 51 per cent, to manufacture computer memories and other products in Britain.    The projectWould cost about $50 million, and Fairchild were anxious for a significant^ount of Government support.    He understood that a maximum Governmentof up to 50 per cent had been mentioned in talks with theePartrnent of Industry at official level.3.GECs object was to get hold of Fair child&apos;s technology on terms whichi*o        Durden the *future profitability of the business with a liability to payValties.    The business plan envisaged gaining 25 per cent of the European^25        wkich, given certain assumptions about price, would mean sales of^    Million, of which more than half would be exports.    The labour forceWhi^ Duild UP to 500 over three years.    This compares with the not&apos;s projectj2 c** by the mid-80s is planned to provide exports of  100 million,^million of import saving and a labour force of 4, 000.4.g.^      Asked about possible alternative proposals before the Government,^^&quot;^rnold Weinstock said that he himself, though he could not speak forchild, would not be put off by such competition, even if it involved not, so
0ng as there was no special treatment, eg procurement preferences, for such^ not company.    He stressed the importance of acquiring American knowhowtechnology.    He knew from experience that very high personal incentivesWould be essential if these were to be secured.Mr Marsh, Technical Director of Standard Telephones and Cables, told***e that ITT had made a firm decision to be involved in at least one segment ofe world semiconductor business.    Computer memories were the largest^gment and ITT had already in Footscray (Kent) the technology to make 4, 000lt memories.    Their plans were to gear up the production of 16, 000 memories -ready in prototype - and to invest in the refinements in the technology^quired for 64, 000 memories.    They aimed at 10 per cent of the world marketr these products, for which Britain would be ITT&apos;s world source of supply.^ Following talks with officials ITT were counting on at least 20-25 per cent0vernrnent financial support, though they would like more, towards an^expenditure of some  10 million.    Their written proposals should reach theePartment of Industry within a few days.    They said their plans were firm, in       as they were part of ITT&apos;s general strategy, but the specific project hadt       not ciaim that their proposals would create any significantoptional employment unless they improved their share of the world market.eed they admitted that the investment was necessary to safeguard presentjobs.not so far received the approval of the ITT Board.8.Like G.C, ITT said unequivocally that they would not be deterred by theesence of competitors;  there should be room in the European and worldarkets for several European suppliers.9^        These talks confirm my conviction that KMOS should go ahead, whethere Projects of ITT and G.C/Fairchild do or not.    Both ITT and G.C made iti    ectly clear to me that a firm not project would have no effect whatever onentions they might have for ventures in this field.pt       It is therefore clear from my discussions with G.C and ITT that theirk^gcts&apos;     they come about, would be much smaller in employment terms thanq    s* would not clash with KMOS, and in any case would require substantial^vernment funding, without answerability to Government, whether in pay policy111 any other way.U.copy am more than ever convinced that KMOS should go ahead. I hope my^^ea8ue8 can agree that the not should now be given our approval to proceed^e ProJect they have unanimously recommended.    Sir Leslie Murphy hasme that further delay will place the project in jeopardy.EGVDePa^23 Y*rtrnent of industry may 1978
