document is the property of her bpitannic majesty&apos;s governmentI CP(78) 55 COPY NO gflj9 May 1978CABINETWEIGHTS AND measures memorandum by the Secretary of State for Prices and consumer Protection1. In his paper CP(78) 53 the Secretary cf State for the Environmentargues that certain imperial units should continue indefinitely in particularsectors of the economy.    I must sa/ that the paper gives a misleading impression of the present situation.     Ultimately we are committed by theTreaty of Accession to the sole use of metric units throughout the european economic Community.   More particularly, Parliament has already agreed tothe phasing out of many imperial units - including the yard - by 1979 and toa review of the remainder in 1979;  in this context &quot;reviewing1  clearly meansestablishing terminal dates.     The pint and mile aire not exceptions to this review.     On the pint all that we have said is that metrication will not leadto a change in the pint size of the milk bottle or beer glass.    So far as themile is concerned, the position of the Secretary of State for Transport is,as I understand it   that there is no pressing need to tackle this issue andthat there will be full consultations when *he time comes to make a change.2. I have not changed my view that the metrication programme on whichwe have been embarked for some time and which already involves the&quot;compulsory metrication&quot; of some products is essential for the wholeeconomy.    Nevertheless, I recognise that the summing up of the discussionof the Ministerial Committee on Economic and Industrial Policy recordedthat, whilst there was &quot;an overwhelming majority&quot; in favour of continuingwith our present programme, the Committee also felt that we should not do so if the Parliamentary Orders necessary for its implementation seemed unlikely to command a majority in the House of Commons.    Since the cabinet discussion on 27 April (CM(78) 16th Conclusions, Minute 1) I have had further conversations with the dissidents in the Parliamentary Labour Party, and itseems clear that there could be no guarantee of carrying in the House the twornajor Orders involving &quot;compulsory metrication&quot;.3. As I said at Cabinet on 27th April, my main concern now is to reducethe embarrassment to the Government which has resulted from the pressure to change our metrication programme.     It was my opinion that this was bestdone by presenting the Orders to Parliament even though a ParliamentaryMajority couJd not be guaranteed or by announcing that they were only being dropped because of the Parliamentary situation.    However, this was not asolution which commended itself to my colleagues, and I am thereforeobliged to think of an alternative strategy.1
4. My proposal is therefore that we should make an immediate announcement (thus bringing the matter to a head quickly) which includes the following points :-i.       After consulting trade, industry and consumer organisations,the Government is confirmed in its view that a move to metricationas a single form of measurement in the wholesaling and retailingsectors is desirable and that the &quot; cut-off dates we have alreadydetermined ought to remain our target.ii.        We are also conscious that there is much apprehensionabout the prospects of legal sanctions against retailers who donot apply the metrication programme after the prescribed date.We therefore propose to suspend any suggestion of &quot;compulsorymetrication&quot; at the point of pale to the consumer. MetricationOrders would continue to be applied to prepacks (as the Secretaryof State for the Environment says in his paper the arguments infavour of this are &quot;genuinely overwhelming&apos; ).iii.        We do, however, propose to use our influence to encourageindustry and commerce to adhere to the proposed dates, and, ifprogress does not prove sufficiently comprehensive to avoidconfusion, we would have to consider again the arguments infavour of a mandatory metrication programme at the point of retail sale.5. I ought to emphasise that I dc not believe that this solution willtotally avoid embarrassment to the Government.    Any change from thepolicy which ha 3 been publicly established for the last three years will beproclaimed as a defeat for us and as a victory for the Conservative party and the newspaper campaign which supported the anti-snetrication movement.However, within the terms of reference allowed to me by colleagues, Ibelieve the scheme set out above is the least damaging of the alternatives.R HDepartment of Prices and Consumer Protection9 May 19782
