MENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 59 copy no 8016 May 1978CABINETKMOS SEMICONDUCTORS LIMITEDMemorandum by the Secrstax-y of State for industry i am seeking the agreement of colleagues to a new venture by theNational Enterprise Board (not).     The latter seek my statutory consent toacquire  50 million of equity in a new company, KMOS Semiconductors Limited,million would be needed now;  the rest would be confirmed in late 1979.More details about the technology, the KMOS proposal, and other activities in this field are given in an Annex to this memorandum.     The mainP0mts that irnoress me are that if KMOS were successful it would ensure aritish presence in a most important growth field in high technology;   it woulda powerful British-controlled rival to the large United States and Japanese^0rnpanies who dominate the scene;  it would provide by 1984 4, 000 jobs inritain in several production units, which might be sited in Assisted Areas;a%1u if its full production were realised it would generate  100 million per annum0* exports and save  20 million in imports.j * The not has not, hitherto, had the opportunity of using its muscle in arge original enterprise of this kind.     For this reason I am anxious that they^ ould be given our consent.    If it is withheld there will be a correspondingScouragement to the not, whose Board are unanimously in favour of the project.     They regard it as involving a high risk - since this is a highly0nipetitive field - but holding a corresponding prospect of profit if the ventureSUcceeds.It is not our task to &quot;second-guess&quot; the not&apos;s judgment of the^&quot;ftrnercial prospects.    Several of my colleagues, however, expressed in thejni8terial Committee on Economic and Industrial Policy doubts on the011owing grounds:-a.       The industrial strategy being developed in this sector identifies asa first priority for Government support the capacity to design and produce &quot;special&quot; micro-circuits ie those designed and made for incorporation in advanced equipment.    The not regards KMOS ascomplementary to any venture in support of &quot;specials&quot;.r
b. The Sector Working Party had not considered the possibility of a&quot;green fields&quot; operation for standards but had recommendedGovernment encouragement and support for an operation in this field byone or more of the established companies.    In fact the Department ofIndustry has been informed by two groups, both involving Americanmultinationals, that they are considering manufacturing &quot;standards&quot; in britain.     The British Government would be expected to share part of therisk and provide some 20-30 per cent of the cost.    These prospects are described in the Annex (paragraphs 12-14).    Faced with KMOS these groups might withdraw.     Of course if the prospects were to proceed,Britain would, in the iield oi &apos;&apos;ci;andards&quot;, be little more than a base forforeign multinationals.c. The rewards for the founder1 s group are potentially very high.The not envisages arrangements worth perhaps several million poundseach for the three top men after 20 years of successful operation andlesser sums for the half-doaen second-level managers.    Rewards like this will attract criticism - but are indispensable if the venture is to betruly entrepreneurial and would only be realised if the venture were successful.     I believe that our decision on this issue will be of greatimportance in deciding whether the not is to fulfil the objectives forwhich it was set up, or is simply to be a passive holding company.I therefore recommend that the not be given authority to proceed withlheir first original venture, which I see as imaginative and capable of bringingCoH8iderable national advantage as well as profit to the not.E G V Department of Industry16 May 1978
ANNEXKMOS SEMICONDUCTORS I/TDBackground note The micro-electronics industry uses integrated circuit (IC)technology to put large numbers of electronic elements onto smallsilicon &quot;chips1.    Developments in this technology have been rapid and it is now possible to put as many as 100,000 elements on to asingle chip less than one quarter of an inch square.   The increasinglevel of integration has brought reductions in cost and power requirements, and improvements in speed of operation and in systemreliability.   The advent of ICs has opened up new markets; further stages of integration will again lead to improved and novel products.2 The circuits can be considered in two main classes;    &apos;special&apos;products designed for a specific purpose, and &apos;standard1 circuitsdesigned to meet general requirements.   Standard memory chips arenow widely used in the computer industry and it is on these that KMOSwill concentrate in the first place. It will also design and produce a range of micro-computers.3 The Sector Working Party is evolving a strategy for this important industry.   They believe that the priority area for supportis that of the design and production of &quot;specials&quot;, which theBritish designer of electronic equipment of all kinds - radar, militaryelectronics, alarm systems, communications, control systems, testequipment, etc. - will increasingly need.   He will thus requiretrustworthy and accessible sources of these circuits and the designskills that go with them.^      The Department of Industry has for several years supported thecivil micro-circuit activities of the three British firms - Plessey,^erranti and G.C - who design and manufacture special integratedcircuits for their own use and for sale to other companies. Thetechnology, however, is entering on a new phase (Very Large-Scaleintegration) and several other Governments are supporting their industries in correspondingly more ambitious research and development programmes.    In Britain the Department of Industry has been discussing/with ...
with the industry a new programme of support, of the order of some 55 million over five years.   The industry may not he able tofund its 50% share of this without some regrouping - which willprobably involve the not, who are in principle willing to helpdeal with the &quot;specials&quot; area.   Of course it is by no means certainthat such a regrouping can be achieved, taking into account our experience with the power plant industry.5 The KMOS proposal concentrates on producing certain standardcircuits.    The draft industrial strategy recognises that it wouldbe desirable to have a UK source of standard circuits but had assumed that it would not be cost-effective to start a freshenterprise making Standard circuits in competition with the UKcompanies.   The SWP envisaged, therefore, that the Government wouloencourage the manufacture of standard circuits by supportingactivities in Britain by or in association with United Statedmulti-nationals.   The Department has been informed of two suchpossibilities which are described in paragraphs 12 - 14 below. two other US multi-nationals have also made some tentative enquiries.6 The KMOS proposal has been made by a small group of people -and UK nationals - with established reputations in the industry.They would aim to design and produce a new product - a memory chipable to store 64,000 &apos;bits&apos; of information.   This product is understudy by a number of companies in the micro-electronics industry-Most companies have 4K and 16K memories to base themselves on, andif necess-ary fall back on;    KMOS will make only 64K.   They intend :minimise their disadvantage by laying down their prototype produce-line in the USA where an infrastructure of experienced IC designer5and other skilled personnel is available.   KMOS aims to beginproduction and sale of their 64K memory in 1980 from this US line*Meanwhile KMOS would be tooling up in the United Kingdom and would produce from their first UK factory in 1982-83.   A second UK factotfwould come on stream in 1983-4.   The US prototype production linewould continue, since this is a recognised means of putting thetechnology into high volume production.7 As it stands the KMOS business plan would make sales of  7in 1980 and could reach  140 million in 1984.   The total investm?-&apos;achieve this is said to be  50 million, of which a half would be- 2 - /commit^CONFIDENTIAL
committed initially.   The business plan forecasts a loss in 1981 butprofits before interest and tax of seventeen to eighteen percent onsales from 1982 onward or a return on capital of twenty-three percentin 1982.9      To meet the needs of a new enterprise, the proposed not invest-ment will take the form of Ordinary and Preferred shares totallingjust over  50 million.   Working capital requirements from 1981 wouldbe met by bank borrowings.   At the present time, a firm commitment of 25 million is sought, the remaining  25 million to be confirmed inlate 1979 following a review of progress from KMOS and the presentation of a refined business plan for 1980 - 84.   To attract the KMOS foundergroup from their present senior positions (mainly in US companies) andto establish the right motivation, the founders group would be expectedto subscribe over the first two years  87,500 for 550,000 ordinary shares of  0.25.   not would, by investing  25 million, receive 250,000Preferred ordinary shares of  100 and 350 ordinary shares of  0.25.-he founders&apos; shares would be the subject of conversion incentivesstill to be agreed;    they may seek firm rewards at an early date linkedto profit performance.   The founders group would, in favourable circumstances, make a gain of several millions of pounds.The not sought advice from one of the foremost consultants in theindustry - Mackintosh Limited.   Mackintosh confirm the stature of theConstituents in the founders&apos; group and also believe that the KMOS^proposal has the attributes, including entrepreneurial origin, whichnecessary for success.It will be seen that KMOS brings together British and CJS skills^ resources.   The US connection will contribute advanced technology^ key staff and access to one of the largest^malcerST of advanced8emi-conductor products.   Britain will contribute some R&amp;D skills;^sonnel for a large high technology manufacturing base; and access*0 the European market.   The business plan envisages by the mid-1980s--^rating some 4,000 jobs in Britain, a large proportion of whichCo^ld be in Assisted Areas and a volume of production earning  20^ilion in import saving and  100 million in exports.    It would beventure completely under British public sector control.
11 It is not our job to 1 second guess1 the not&apos;s commercialjudgements.    They recognise that the market for 64K memories willbe highly competitive but believe that they can gain 10 percentof the world markets as a number of other companies believe they themselves can.   KMOS would be competing for sc, nce skills, but would have the advantage of starting from scratch e ^d therefor of being able to attract the right people.   They woula not haveother products to learn by, as their competitors would, but bysame token, would be able to concentrate on their own originalproduct.12 The Department of Industry has been informed of two otherprospects for investment in UK production of &apos;standard1 memories &amp;micro-processors.    One would be a joint venture between the Arner^-0&apos;multi-nationals Fairchild and G.C with an investment of about 14 million, leading to sales of  25 million per year by 1982.Support from Government of about  4- million or  5 million would ^needed to ensure that Fairchild come to the UK.    Fairchild are ^amongst the world leaders in memory ICs and micro-processors wi^Hestablished world-wide market for their products and they now *xto have a European production base.   They would transfer their accumulated technology in this field to the UK, possibly allowi^G.C to have a controlling interest;    they say they would be rea^to market the UK products in the US and elsewhere if G.C so wis^&apos;They would develop the 64K memory from their 4K and 16K ranges,of which would be manufactured in the UK as the market develops-13 ITT are considering investing about  10 million leading t0sales of about  40 million by 1981/2.    They would expect Govern016 ^support of about  2 million and would build on their existingat Footscray which is already their world centre for the &apos;M0S&apos;technology used in memory chips.    ITT development work on memor-in the UK has a high reputation and they are major producers oisemi-conductor products in general but their IC activity in theis small.    They say they would develop 64K memories from their ^and 16M products and would like to make the UK their sole produccentre for memories.- 4 -H*cthethe1,015itovOfItope
nese two prospects would be aimed at essentially the sames as KMOS.   They envisage combined sales of  65 million by^     with subsequent but unspecified build-up in later years. this be COnipared with predicted sales for KMOS of  140 million by 1984.tc-tal investment in these proposals would be  24 million ( 7 millionj    0vernment) to be compared with  50 million (all from not),^d Fairchild&apos;s investment figure is less than that of KMOS^ey have   only planned to 1981/82; and because much of^rly R&amp;D and production technology either already exists in^ UK (y:       VITT) or would be transferred from the US (Fairchild). employment the inr1&apos;00o       exPected from Fairchild and ITT proposals would be aboutin 1982 to be compared with 4,000 in 1984 by KMOS.It ^      &quot;*&quot;s not possible to say whether these prospects would go aheadthey S Proceeds.   Both G.C/Fairchild and ITT have indicated thatWould not expect their proposals to be the only ones to receiveOf       uu support but would expect even-handedness m the allocation-y    Port;   they might feel, however, that to compete with a wholly0v6rnW     Qment-owned company could compromise their position in a UK
