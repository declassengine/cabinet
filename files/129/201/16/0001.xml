UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 66 COPYNO26 June 1978CABINETAFRICAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs*&apos; Africa consists of 49 states with total population of over 400 million.The Organisation of African Unity (OAU), founded in 1963, is the one body^hich speaks for the Continent as a whole (excluding of course Rhodesia andSouth Africa), but its record in resolving African problems is not encouraging,African problems are deep-seated and not new though they are newsworthy.The real threat to Africa is chaos, not Soviet influence.    The basic statis-tlCs on Africa are covered in Annex A.    Countries having significantbilateral relationships with African countries are covered in Annex B.united kingdom interests in africa the United Kingdom has the following major interests in Africa:a.       Commercial and FinancialUnited Kingdom exports to black African countries ( 1. 742 million in1977) go predominantly to Nigeria and other Commonwealth countries and comprise mainly machinery, transport equipment, manufacturedgoods and chemicals.    Net invisible earnings from African countries(excluding South Africa) totalled  232 million in 1975, excluding oilreceipts.    The book value of United Kingdom direct investment inthese countries is around  850 million.    Africa (excluding SouthAfrica) holds about 25 per cent of official sterling balances but with-drawal no longer poses any threat.    The Export Credits guarantee department (ECGD) commitment is  2.4 billion in 1977 and there areUnited Kingdom aid loans outstanding of  295 million in 1976.United Kingdom exports to South Africa in 1977 amounted to 581 million and included heavy capital and high technology goods.The United Kingdom has large direct investments in South Africa witha book value of  1. 4 billion and a current market value of  2.8 billion.There are also portfolio investments of  1. 9 billion and net bank\
claims of around  1. 3 billion in 1977.    Net invisible receipts, mainly from this investment, but excluding oil receipts, totalled around 340 million in 1975.    The ECGD commitment is  720 million.b. ResourcesThe United Kingdom obtains a substantial proportion of essential rawmaterials from South Africa as well as from Namibia, Zambia, Zaireand Ghana.    Further details are at Annex C.c. British CommunitiesApart from Rhodesia and South Africa, there are large Britishcommunities in some black African countries, eg Zambia 27, 500 andKenya 11, 000 excluding Asian United Kingdom Passport Holders.d. InternationalSeveial African countries play a significant role in international issues of direct concern to the United Kingdom, including Southern Africanas well as North-South issues.    Nigeria is a significant member ofthe Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.threat to united kingdom interests* The threat to these interest comes from:a. Continued racial conflict and guerrilla fighting producingeconomic disruption, initially from a failure to achieve a negotiated settlement in either Namibia or in Rhodesia and ultimately in SouthAfrica itself.    It is hard to exaggerate the effect of the existence ofminority white regions on the whole of Africa politically and economically.    It has already damaged the economies of Zambia,Mozambique, Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho.    It is also the issue which weakens the standing of the West generally within Africa and provides fertile ground for Communist subversion.b. Inefficient and corrupt administration which is widespread.Zaire is the current focus of attention but Nigeria faces growingproblems;  Ghana is in great difficulty and many others are affected.Corrupt regimes often turn to repression and gross violations of human rights to survive.    Uganda is the most publicised but theCentral African Empire is probably worse.    Ethiopia, Zaire,Equitorial Guinea and Benin have all got appalling human rightsrecords.
c. Artificial colonial boundaries bearing no relation to ethnicor tribal factors which conceal or create anomalies and fostertensions within and between states.    The Sahara, Chad, Eritrea,Ogaden and Zaire are areas of actual conflict but there are other areas of potential conflict.d. Economic dependence on one major commodity. Zambiaand Zaire are dependent on copper.    Botswana on beef, Cameroonon cocoa and Ethiopia on coffee.^TERVENTION BY COMMUNIST POWERSf&apos;        Since 1975 the Soviet Union has acquired a non-white, revolutionarylntervention force in the shape of the Cuban Armed Forces.    This can tip*he balance of power in localised African disputes.    The Soviet Union haskeen able over the years by supplying arms to liberation movements in africa to have an influence over their revolutionary clients when they have^tered government, e. g. the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola.They are investing for the future by supporting the South West African PeoplesOrganisation, the Patriotic Front and the African National Congress (SouthAfrica).    The central feature of Soviet action is to work in support ofindigenous African Governments and movements, never taking an overt lead.he problem is becoming more acute because opportunities for them are now^ore numerous and Soviet capability is greater.    Soviet activities are supported in a small but efficient way by the activities of the Germanernocratic Republic as well as by other East European countries. The0viet Union has, however, been rejected by some African states where they/ere previously influential e. g. Egypt, Guinea, Somalia and Mali.The Chinese have, after a lull, recently stepped up their activityagain.Actors working for the west^&apos;        Friendly bilateral ties have survived the post-colonial period between^ e United Kingdom and (in a very different way) France and many of theirrmer colonies.    The bilateral ties within the Commonwealth are aCo^siderable asset.    Although the Soviet Union can target its economic aidSeIectively and effectively, it cannot compete with the West in economic aidlIi the provision of markets to African goods. Islam remains a significantbo       ^ an^ conservative force in the north and west of Africa, an importantnd between anglophone and francophone countries in West Africa and an^fological force which acts against the extension of Soviet influence. Theth*-1CanS wan* to keep outside powers, especially the super powers, out of^ ^r affairs and are suspicious of Soviet motives.    Although the OAU has^sappointing, African countries have a number of regional agreements,uding a network of defence co-operation agreements between individualntrie8 or groups of states.
EXISTING UNITED KINGDOM POLICY&apos;*        We support fully the Charter of the OAU.    We use our influencepredominantly through our Commonwealth links.    We have a generous aid programme both bilateral, multilateral and through Lome.    We are, however,gravely weakened because of our inability to settle Rhodesia and because of0ur ambivalence over South Africa.    We are at long last seen to be genuinelTi Qur search for a settlement over Namibia and Rhodesia.    We havelncreased substantially our support for genuine liberation movements though^8 does not totally offset our inability to supply them with arms. Ministers^Ve made the decision to try and reduce our economic dependence on SouthAfrica, to discourage new investment voluntarily and to seek out newresources of minerals.    This policy is, however, still in its infancy. we continue to offer investment insurance and export credits, and to promotee*ports to South Africa.    While we do this we shall continue to be highlySuspect and vulnerable to African criticism.    We aim to keep within the collective decisions of the United States, Canada, France and Germany, to^0 no more than they, but also to do no less.    We can expect continuedPressure to do more and the other Four countries will almost certainly movefester at times than we appear to wish.oWe alone of our Western partners have broken diplomatic relations^ith Uganda.    We managed to persuade the European Economic Communityj**EC) to change their aid pattern under Lome to avoid as far as possibleStressing the regimes of Uganda and the Central African Empire. Most0* our partners were, however, reluctant and we now have difficulty,Particularly from the French, in introducing any human rights considerationslnto Lome II.o*        We are co-ordinating policy towards Africa far more than ever before.he Five Western Security Council powers Initiative over Namibia and the^nglo/United States initiative over Rhodesia are buttressed by frequent^0Uective discussion at Foreign Minister level between my United States,rench and German counterparts.    We are using the Political Co-operationMachinery of the Nine and from this stems the Code of Conduct forJJ0mpanies operating in South Africa.    We are also trying to encourageaudi Arabia and other oil rich states to increase their aid to Africa and to^rd them politically.^TURE POLICY^*      Our present policy should be maintained.    Most of the policies which^ in the United Kingdom and the West generally should adopt to help avert^os will also help to reduce Soviet influence or penetration.    We should. consider increasing our aid to Africa and consider alsowhether there is greater scope for politically motivated aid focussedwhere political instability threatens, and we should also be preparedto make aid conditions on political and economic reforms, as in Zaire;4
b. increase the training of Africans, particularly for administration;c. increase our training of military personnel both because ofthe continuing importance of the military in most African countries and to enable them to maintain the security of their countries withoutthe need for outside intervention.    This applies particularly tofriendly countries to whom we also supply arms, such as Kenya;d. act with greater urgency to reduce our economic dependence on South Africa;e. use our influence in the e.c., with the Americans and through our Commonwealth links, to help Africans resolve their problemsespecially through the OAU or the United Nations.D A L Oforeign and Commonwealth Office26 June 19785
