DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(78) 70 COPY NO 8029 June 1978CABINETFINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR 16-18 YEAR OLDS IN FULL-TIMEEDUCATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and Science and paymaster General and the Secretary of State for wales. In accordance with CM(78) 18th Conclusions, Minute 5, I have consulted the local authorities about possible arrangements for a mandatorysystem of support for young people aged 16-18 in full-time education. TheCouncil of the Local Education Authorities (CLEA), the Welsh JointEducation Committee (WJEC), the Secretary of State for Wales and I havenow jointly adopted the paper at Annex I.    The Secretary of State for wales and I are reporting to our colleagues on the basis of that joint view.2. The announcement of the Government&apos;s commitment in principle toimproved financial support arrangements for 16-18 year olds in full-timeeducation has been generally well received, in particular by the Party, theTrades Union Congress, organisations representing young people and the educational world.    It has also been widely publicised.    It is generally felt and, as the paper at Annex I shows, the local authorities endorse theview that a comprehensive fully mandatory system of support is needed;we would not favour a system which is partly discretionary.    It will beseen also that full attention has been given to the standards and relevanceof the education available to young people in this age range - matters onwhich the Secretary of State for Wales and I acknowledge colleagues&quot;concern.    Neither the local authorities nor we consider that it would bedesirable or practicable to attempt to discriminate in making awardsaccording to the course which a student intended to follow.    Rather wewould point to the value of the wide range of educational opportunityalready available and assert with some confidence that the quality of thateducation will continue to improve.    The pattern of provision is kept under review in any case;  and where this process reveals deficiencieswhich need remedy, we think the proper answer is to make changes as a deliberate act of educational management, not to seek to operate indirectlythrough an awards system.1
3. Concerning the size of awards, the local education authorities arethinking in terms very similar to those discussed in CP(78) 54, and ourjoint note has been prepared on the basis of a maximum award of  7. 50a week payable in both schools and further education in respect of those from families on supplementary benefit or equivalent income.    We proposemeans-testing on a net family income basis, taking account of family size,on much the same basis as the present assessment for free school mealspurposes.    The minimum award would be  1 a week, payable at a cut-offpoint somewhat below the median income of families with children aged 16-18.No award would be paid at incomes above that point.4. The cost of this scheme will depend very much on the extra numberswho decide in consequence to stay on in full-time education.    Depending onthe assumptions adopted, the scheme is estimated to produce from 26, 000to 63, 000 additional participants.    We wish to maximise these numbers,and would hope in the event, by presenting the awards in association withthe  4 a week child benefit payable from April next year, to reach a target of 50, 000 extra participants.    If that is achieved, the additional recurrent expenditure (England and Wales) will run at a level of about  110 million a year when the scheme is fully operational, ie three /ears after itsinception.    That sum would cover award costs in respect of those whoalready stay on (some 190, 000 out of a total of about 620, 000 in maintainedschools and further education establishments), awards for new participantsand the additional education costs, in schools and further education, of thelatter.    There would be savings on supplementary and unemploymentbenefit estimated at present to rise to  23 million a year.    There wouldalso be capital expenditure totalling  74 million, spread over some fouryears, required to provide the additional capacity in further educationcolleges for the 20, 000 extra participants expected to go there - but not in schools, which should be able to absorb their share of the extra numbers.(Further details of these figures are given in Annex II).    In terms of income distribution effects, some 70 per cent of expenditure on awardswould go to the poorest 25 per cent of families.5. A number of important questions remain to be settled in further discussion, such as whether the payment should be made to parent or theyoung person, how parity of treatment can best be secured as between theschool and further education systems and the proportion of the award costs which should be met by the Exchequer.    Our present view is that theExchequer share of the award costs should be 90 per cent, as withmandatory awards to students in higher education, but we propose to have further talks on the matter with the local authorities.    Non-award costs would rank for rate support grant in the ordinary way.6. We have also considered with the local authorities the implications of adopting a new support scheme for 16-18 year olds for the presentdiscretionary awards system for students aged 19+ not now entitled tomandatory awards.    We recognise that the discretionary awards review2
already in hand is given added urgency by the prospect of a mandatoryscheme for 16-18 year olds, but have reached no conclusions about the kindof changes which ought to be introduced for this 19+ field.    The cost of changes in this area might be up to  20 million per annum.7. The local authorities have impressed on us the need to work fast ifthe new system is to be introduced for the academic year 1979-80.    A firm commitment is needed to the principle of a 16-18 awards system and to thenecessary expenditure, so that the operational details of a scheme can besettled in consultation with the local authorities, so that preparations for legislation can go ahead, and so that local authorities, schools and collegescan begin preliminary work towards a September 1979 start.8. The Chief Secretary, Treasury is opposed to proceeding in this waypartly because of the doubts that he has already expressed about the effectiveness of the scheme and because of the resentment that it is likelyto cause to those families whose income is above the level that qualifies forthe award.    The main reason for his opposition is, however, that the largeadditions to public expenditure which the scheme would involve - in Scotlandand Northern Ireland as well as in England and Wales - would be incompatible with the strategy that he has proposed in CP(78) 69.    That is,first, that there should be no net additions to total programmes in the next two years 1979-80 and 1980-81 beyond the changes set out in his paper and,secondly, that although   some additions may be possible in the twosubsequent years, the scope is limited and it will be necessary to considerpriorities between different programmes before making a major commitment to one of them.9. The Secretary of State for Wales and I nevertheless seek theagreement of colleagues to:a. an announcement that the Government intends to proceed tointroduce a scheme of the kind described above, to start inSeptember 1979;b. recurrent expenditure in England and Wales of nearly 60 million in 1979-80 rising to  115 million in 1982-83, and capitalexpenditure totalling  74 million spread over the same period. Thiswould be an addition to the education programme in the 1978 public expenditure Survey Report;c. preparations being put in hand for appropriate legislation tobe introduced early in the next Session.S WJ MDepartment of Education and Science29 June 19783
AririEX 116-18 STUDENT SUPPORTJOINT NOTE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE, THE COUNCIL OFLOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES AND THE WELSH JOINT EDUCATION COMMITTEEINTRODUCTION1-   This note records the substance of our first two meetings on       16-18 studentsupport arrangements.   It deals with the case for an improved system; outlinesthe form which a new scheme might take; offers estimates of likely overall costsSfld the effect on rates of participation by young people in continued full-timeeducation; and explores the administrative and financial implications for localauthorities of a scheme administered by them.   More detailed examination of theform, scope and cost is being undertaken jointly by DES, DHSS, WOED, CLEA andWJEC officials.THE NEED FOR IMPROVED ARRANGEMENTS?*   The case for an improved 16-18 awards system rests mainly on the desirabilityQf increasing participation rates significantly above present and projected levelsWe are convinced that there would be very real value to individual young people^d to the nation in a policy which secured that aim, and the education servicestands ready to provide worthwhile courses for those who would be led to stay oneven modest levels of award.3.   We are concerned that none should decide against education at the 16+ decisionPoint for purely financial reasons.   Real family poverty may have been eradicatedV the development of the social security system, with &quot;hardship&quot; in an absolutesense no longer being a disincentive to continued education.   Yet for low incomefamiiies there are very real sacrifices involved in having one or more of theiroffspring stay on in education.   We believe that young people themselves perceivethose consequences and are influenced accordingly in their staving-on decisions.wish to remove that bias against education.   Clearly 16-18 awards cannot andshould not try to compete with paid employment.   Equally it is unrealistic toe*Pect them to be offered universally at the same levels as the Manpower ServicesCoi&amp;mission allowances for young people on the Youth Opportunities Programme; that^schatcht cost up to  1,000m a year, including the cost of meeting the additional^mand for education    What -re think is needed is an award which, although modest^ relative .erms, will help the poorer families significantly (particularly when^Plied on top of the  U Child 3enefit payable from April 1979) and so relieve
young people and their families of undue financial pressures to leave educationprematurely,   (in this connection we accept that much of the award money paid under any arrangements of the kind we envisage would go to the families of thosewho would stay on in any case.   But that is not, in our view, to be seen as&quot;wasted&quot; money, since means-testing would ensure that it would all go to families of below-average income, and mostly to the poorest of those.   Rather than wastedmoney, we would regard it as an important social benefit to do something to helpthose who currently make such financial sacrifice.)k.   The reduction in youth unemployment which would follow from increased partic-ipation would be an important by-product -of a 16-18 awards system.5. We think that at this stage a realistic target for increased participationmight be of the order of 50,000 for England and Wales, and we believe that a schemeof the kind outlined in later sections could produce that result, and also makeuseful contributions in relation to family hardship, freedom of choice and youthunemployment.COURSES FOR THE 16-18 AGE GROUP6. Concern has been expressed that those who would choose to stay on in education should not do so for wrong reasons and that they should spend their time to goodpurpose.   We note that all who stay on after 16* are volunteers and thereforelikely to be motivated towards education, unlike some of those in the final year(s)of compulsory education.   We also note that there is no sense in which those whostay on because of an award can be regarded as having been &quot;bought&quot; into continuededucation.   All the other options would pay them personally larger amounts ofmoney; only for those with a prior bias in favour of continued education will an award be sufficient to tilt the balance of the decision.7. We regard it as vital that those who are led to stay on by the availability of an award should spend their time in relevant education which will benefitthem as individuals and the nation as a whole.   That applies equally to thosewho would stay on in any case.   We are clear that no standard prescription will serve.   The future needs of industry, commerce and society at large are veryvaried and difficult to define.   Equally, young people differ widely as regards their needs and aspirations - in ability, aptitude, attainment, maturity, personal
and family situations, and degree of certainty about future plans. What theeducation service must do is to provide effectively and economically for thatdiversity of need.8. The education service has traditionally made provision through *A&apos; leveland equivalent examinations for those intending to proceed to higher education.It also provides for those with a clear vocational commitment through a wide range of full-time vocational courses in further education, at a variety of levels and leading to nationally recognised qualifications awarded by the Technicianand Business Education Councils (TEG and BEC), Joint Committees, the City andGuilds of London Institute (CGLl), Regional Examining Bodies (REBs), the royal society of Arts (sforza) and a host of professional and trade bodies.   In totalthere is a comprehensive range of vocational courses at all levels and covering the full spectrum of occupation - from banker to builder, from agricultural workerto accountant.9. The benefits of continued education are not confined to those of above-average academic ability and/or clear vocational commitment.   Much attention^handicapped.focuses at present on the less able, the uncommited andine/,je believe that is right; we are also very much aware that the development of appropriate courses for such young people presents the education service with a major contemporarychallenge.   Again, there is a range of needs to be met.   For some the right course will be to seek to improve their ,0I level or CSE qualifications. Somewill need to follow non-examination courses, perhaps of a remedial character,to help them into subsequent employment.   There is also room for improvement inthe further education of the handicapped, as recognised in the recent Report ofthe Warnock Committee.   Many will need courses of a general pre-employment orPre-vocational kind.   We note a number of valuable initiatives in these latterareas:i. the development of CGLI foundation courses in schools and colleges, aimed at general occupational areas (construction,engineering, food and agriculture industries etc) but not atspecific jobs;ii. the broadly similar Certificates of Further Education offered by REBs in a variety of areas (engineering, construction, pre-nursing, and business and commercial studies);
iii. &quot;second chance&quot; opportunities for those aiming at employmentin business and commerce, through the Certificate of OfficeStudies, now being administered by BEG;iv. bridging courses designed to improve the continuity of provisionbetween schools and colleges of further education.We note that the general possibilities in this area are under review by a study group set up by the Secretary of State under the chairmanship of Professor Keohaneto look at the present pilot courses in schools for the Certificate of ExtendedEducation.   And perhaps in the longer term there is the possibility of the evolution of school sixth form curricula which take advantage of the work of bodies such as TEC and e.c..10. There is undoubtedly much to be learned about Provision for the less able and less committed of our 16-18 year olds, and a continuing drive is needed toimprove quality and relevance. Processes of review, reform and revitalisation areperennially at work in the education system - currently we have not only thedevelopment work of bodies such as TEC, BEC and CGLI, but also the new KeohaneGroup review of options in the Certificate of Extended Education area, the recently completed review of 16+ examinations by the Waddell Committee, andthe Schools Council work on 18+ examinations.   Such continuous adjustment andadaptation is part of the stock-in-trade of the education service.   The needfor it always existed but may become sharper as more young people stay on in education, as a result of improved support arrangements or for other reasons.11. Associated with the need for continued scrutiny and up-dating of courses and examinations are parallel need  for more effective careers education andguif^jance programmes in schools (so that young people may be helped to the rightchoices for them at 16+) and for improved provision for those who stay on,whether in schools or in further education colleges, through the work of the localCareers Service and of the institutions themselves.   Again, these needs exist now,but are given added importance by the prospect of increased 16-18 participation in the future.LIMITATION OF AWARDS TO PARTICULAR COURSESt12. We have considered carefully the possibility of limiting awards to particularcourses, being those which are perceived as relevant to national or individualneeds.   Such a notion of &quot;preference for relevance&quot; suffers from grave objectionsof educational principle and practice.   From society&apos;s point of view, there is no
satisfactory manpower planning base from which to suggest that some coursesshould be regarded as more worthwhile than others; from the individual&apos;s pointcf view, particularly for those at this transitional age, there is no way ofAssessing the relevance or otherwise of a particular course to a young person1slong-term needs in working life.   Moreover, we fear that any attempt to drawdistinctions between courses would lead to distortions of course design to ensurethat they conferred eligibility for an award, to the neglect of many importantareas (eg languages) which might not be able to prove a direct employment relevance,and to ossification of course provision by institutions.13.   We consider that any attempt to limit eligibility for an award by the courseundertaken would be administratively unworkable.   There are no accepted criteriawhich courses oould be classified centrally.   Full-time TEC courses for thisage group, for example, commonly consist of a large number of independent studyunits, many of which are devised at college level and validated by TEC. would all such units have to be scrutinised for eligibility or would all TEC coursesbe automatically eligible, no matter what their content?  Would all &apos;A&apos; levelsubjects attract an award?   If not, what would happen in cases where a studenttook a combination of eligible and ineligible subjects?  Again, how could oneuistinguish between a cgli certificated course and its college certificatedequivalent?   Any attempt to tackle such complexity centrally or locally wouldinvolve a formidable workload and even so, in our view, would have no realProspect of providing genuinely fair treatment for all courses and students.In short, we see no case for limiting awards to those following particularcourses.   In our view the proper approach to dealing with defects in courseProvision for this age group is to laake improvements or replacements -that, as already noted, is a separate and continuing concern and a main objectivecf educational policy.Nature of schemeWe are agreed that the new scheme must be fully mandatory, if it is to havethe desired affect on participation rates and to avoid unwarranted distortionsbetween courses and undesirable differences of treatment between areas. All^tisfying the conditions of eligibility for an award should therefore receive0l*e.   We are clear that the new scheme must be means-tested, first, because the costs of any worthwhile scheme would otherwise be prohibitively high and, secondly,because means-testing would help to redress present imbalances in particpationta-tes between different sections of the population.   We are also concerned that
the axrangements should provide for parity of treatment as between schools andfurther education.ADMINISTRATION OF A MANDATORY SCHEME16. We have considered a number of possible ways of administering a means-testedawards scheme.   One suggestion was that DHSS should undertake the work; theGovernment view was that in the DHSS field only the Supplementary Benefit system could provide an appropriate mechanism but that there was no possibility of the supplementary Benefit Commission agreeing to undertake the task on top of theirpresent responsibilities.   We have also considered whether means-testing could bearranged satisfactorily by making parents liable for tax on a flat-rate award;we rejected that because it would provide a significant award even for those fromvery well-off families and because it would pay the sane net award across the very wide range of family income liable to standard rate tax.   We still have underreview a suggestion that satisfactory means-testing could be arranged throughthe taxation system; the principles and practicalities of such an arrangement,including provision for clawback, are now being explored with the Board of InlandRevenue.17. There are in any event positive arguments  in favour of an LEA axiministeredscheme.   LEAs* considerable experience of administering educational awardsschemes means that they are well placed to run the new scheme as an extension ofthe existing activities.   If they did so it would greatly ease the problems involved in dealing with families with children benefiting under more than oneawards scheme at the same time.18. While the LEAs might prefer any scheme to be administerd through DHSS orthe tax system, they recognise that such approaches may prove not to be practicalIn that event the authorities are prepared to say that they could and would take on the job of administration.   Our discussions are proceeding for the present onthe assumption that the scheme will be administered by LEAs - with due recognition that -this would entail increases in local authority manpower and expenditure.We return to this in paragraph 25 below.ESSENTIAL SCHEME DETAILS19. We have examined an illustrative scheme based on the following propositions
a. the same maximum award would apply to the full 16-18 age range;b. The total payment in respect of a young person from the poorest unilies would be broadly equivalent to the Supplementary benefit which he would receive if unemployed, after account is taken of continued eligibility for Child Benefit of  k a week (from April1979). Accordingly we have worked on the basis of a maximum award of  7.50ic. The award would run for all 52 weeks of the year, provided theyoung person remained in full-time education;d. the possible need for a cash differential in favour of further education to compensate for benefits in kind received by schoolpupils is left for later decision;e. assessment would be based on net family income calculated in a waysimilar to that used in the free school meals scheme (ie gross family income from all sources, less tax, national insurance, net housingcosts and work expenses, allowing for the size of the family);f. any award would be tax-free and disregarded for the assessment ofexisting family benefits;g. the maximum award should be payable to those from families on SBor equivalent income (now about  1,700 net).   Awards would reduce by 3** a year for every  100 by which net income exceeded that level upto the point where other family income support schemes cease  to havean impact (a net income of just under  2,100 at present) and by  50 ayear for every  100 in net income above that, running to a cut-offwhere /the award scheme would cease,point at an award of  1 per week,/ At present this would be at a net income of some  2,500 (equivalent to a gross family income for a two-childfamily of about  /f,300, compared with the current median income of families with children aged 16-19 of about  5,000).No clear view has emerged as to whether payment should be made to parents0* to young people themselves, and we see merits in both arrangements. There^ arguments against making payments direct to young people in this age-group*hich have to be weighed against the possible reduction in the influence on atoung person&apos;s decision to stay on in full-time education if payments are madeto parents. LEAs&apos; practical experience of the variety of family circumstancesykich can arise lends some weight to the argument that this be left to the
discretion of local authorities, at least in the early years of operation ofthe scheme.   We shall return to consider this matter further, along with a numberof operational details of the scheme - starting dates, method and frequency of payment, residence requirements, Easter leavers etc.NUMBERS ATTRACTED AND AWARD COSTS21. Reliable evidence on which to base any calculation of likely numbers and costs is scarce.   The best available derives from a 1977 survey of the attitudesof 3,000 fifth-formers in England and Wales; this provides an indication of theproportion of the age group who might be attracted to stay on by particular ratesof grant paid directly to them, but gives no information about their family income*For the purposes of calculation, therefore, one might adopt alternative assumptions about family income distribution: an &quot;optimistic&quot; assumption (in terms of staying-on rates) that all those prepared to stay on for an award of the level proposed would be concentrated in the bottom Z^o of the family income range; and acorresponding &quot;pessimistic&quot; assumption that they would be distributed evenlyacross the whole family income range.   These bounding assumptions produce very wide ranges of estimates for cost and numbers.22. On the basis set out above, and quoting for illustrative purposes the mid-points of the ranges derived, DES calculations suggest that under a scheme with amaximum award of  7.30 Per week some 2i3,0O0 young people would receive awardswhen the scheme was in full operation (in year 3).   About 26,000 of those wouldbe new participants, and the total award cost would be some  53m.   These calcul-ations, however, take no account of the possible effect of a universal Child Beneof  4 per week payable to parents in respect of 16-19 year olds in full-time educ^tion.&quot; Although in itself the Child Benefit might be thought to be insufficient t0significantly affect leaving/staying decisions, taken together with an award of up to  7.50 it offers the prospect, of a further increase in participation. Thusif the full CB payment were to&apos;be seen- by young people and their parents as a benefit of staying on in addition to any award which might be payable, then theIt
number of new participants attracted by the scheme might be as high as 63,000out of a total of some 250,000 award holders, and at a total award cost of some 66m a year.CONSEQUENTIAL COSTS AND SAVINGS23. There will be both capital and recurrent education costs to be met in respectof the increased participation.   If new participants choose to stay on at school or go to an FE college in the same proportions as those who stay on at present,then DES calculations put the total recurrent education costs at  21m if 26,000extra young people stay on, rising to  53m if 63,000 stay on.   The capital costof providing new places would be  38m or  93m respectively, assuming for thePurposes Of the   calculation that schools will have sufficient capacity to accommodate&quot;their share without additional capital expenditure and that further education willhave no spare capacity.24. The reduction in the unemployment register might be about 9tf&amp; of the numberof new participants, allowing both for the additional teachers required and thefact that not all those attracted to contining full-time education, or not all of those who got jobs the latter might otherwise have taken, would have registered as unemployed.   The resultant savings in SB payments are estimated at some  12m andsome  29m respectively.ADMINISTRATION COSTS25. A means-tested scheme of the kind outlined above administered by LEAs mighthave to handle some 300,000-350,000 award claims annually.   The work would peakin the summer months and the arrangements needed would be similar to those already adopted for the administration of existing HE and 16-19 awards.   On this basis,and assuming termly payments, the local authorities estimate that they would need to take on the equivalent of about 500 extra staff, many of them perhaps on atemporary basis, and that the total cost of administering the scheme would amountto some  2m- 3m annually.SUMMARY OF COSTS^6.   The table below summarises the costs and effects of the illustrative scheme:
*Case A Case BMax Award  7.50: Max Award  7.50:(assume no increased (assume fullparticipation on account      perception of andof Child Benefit payments)   reaction to ChildBenefit payments)ParticipationTotal numbers receiving award (000&apos;s) 213 250New participants: numbers (000fs) 26 63: as percentage of 16-18 1.1 2.6age groupRocurrent CostsAward (less savings on existing 53 65education benefits)    ( m pa)Costs of administering awards system ( m pa)      2.5 2.education Costs ( m pa) 21 53Total Gross Recurrent Cost ( m pa) 76.5 121.5Possible SB Savings ( m pa) 12 29Capital Cost of additional 38 93FE capacity ( m)NOTES: (i) Calculations based on 1979/80 numbers and November 1977 prices andrelate to the time when the scheme would be in full operation (ie threeyears from its inception).(ii) All figures represent the mid-points of wide ranges (cf paragraphs21 and 22).
27. The proportion of total awards expenditure going to those who would havestayed on in any case will vary according to how many new participants areattracted: thus if 26,000 extra young people stayed on some QO% of the awardsmoney would go to those who would have stayed on in any case, whereas if as many as 63,000 extra stayed on that proportion would fall to some 6$C.   The means-testing arrangements would mean that virtually all new participants would bre from the lower income groups.   In terms of income distribution effects*some70% of gross awards expenditure would go to the poorest 23&amp; of families.19+ AWARDS28. There is considerable pressure to improve the awards arrangements for 19+home students who do not already qualify for mandatory awards, and the localeducation authorities are committed to reviewing the operation of the discretionaryawards system covering such people.   The introduction of a mandatory system for16-18 year olds could only strengthen the case for such a review, not least becauseof the need to avoid anomalies at age 19.   We have not reached any conclusionabout the form any consequent changes might take.   If it were decided, forexample, that the mandatory HE awards scheme should extend to cover all 19+home students, the cost in respect of existing students would be of the orderof  20m pa; if more modest changes were adopted, the cost would be correspondinglylower.FUNDING29. We started from the premise that if possible the introduction of new arrangements should not increase the rate-borne burden of award and administrationcosts, which in respect of EMAs and 16-18 further education discretionary grantswe estimate at approximately  2.7% at present.   On the basis of 90% specificgrant towards award costs, the additional rate-borne cost of the scheme discussedabove would be of the order of  5-6m pa.   The administrative costs of operatingthe scheme would be counted as relevant expenditure for RSG purposes, and would add a further  lm to rate-borne costs.   Together these would produce an increasein rate-borne expenditure of about  km on award and administration costs. the implication   of this would seem to be that in order to avoid an increase in rate-home costs on account of the introduction of the scheme, a grant rate above 90%would be needed.   We note the long-standing local authority objective of 100% grant towards HE award costs, and the general desirability of the same grant practiceapplying to the HE and 16-18 fields.   Tte illustrative scheme is based on theassumption of 90% grant rate, but the local authorities may wish to return tothis matter at a later stage.
30. The recurrent education costs (teaching and non-teaching) arising from newparticipants would count as relevant expenditure in the usual way.TIMING31.   We are agreed that if possible the scheme should come into operation inSeptember 1979.   If this is to be possible, however, the local authorities need to be sufficiently certain that the scheme will have a firm foundation in lawin time for schools and colleges to make the necessary preparations and forauthorities to recruit and  train the additional staff they will require and toset up the appropriate administrative machinery.   This means that legislationought to have had a S second Reading in the Commons  preferably by Christmas and *the latest by the end of January 1979, . with regulations followingsoon after the Royal Assent.   If this is not achieved, we shall need to review the position early in the New Year.
