DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(78) 57V    &apos; COPY no May 1978CABINETASSISTANCE TO KIRKBY MANUFACTURING and engineering COMPANY LIMITED (KME)Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Employment* The memorandum by the Minister of State, Department of Industryattached to CP(78) 56 acknowledged that this was a difficult case on which toreach a decision, but in my view sufficient emphasis was not given to thePoints in favour of granting further assistance.2* The first of these is that PA Management Consultants, a firm of thehighest repute, came to the firm view, after a careful examination of KME&apos;sProspects, that the company would become viable if it were granted theassistance which it requested.     They maintained this view in spite of thefurther information supplied to them by the Department of Industry about&quot;le plans of KME&apos;s competitors.     I do not think that we should underrate thisreport, nor do I think we should overlook the fact that KME&apos;s prospects arelikely to be substantially improved by the closure of their loss-makingactivities and by the strengthening of their management structure, both ofwhich were recommended by the Consultants and accepted by the presentManagement.    The Consultants also drew attention to the improvement inthe morale of the workforce and the increased tempo of the production lines,koth of which, in my view, augur well for the future.* Secondly, the Exchequer cost of clocing the factory, making 645workers redundant and inevitably adding that number (even if not the actualWorkers involved) to the total of unemployed on Merseyside, would be approaching  1.8 million in the first year.    Moreover, a not much less cost^would  be incurred in subsequent years for so long as unemployment remainedhlgh on Merseyside.4Furthermore, we must view the application in the context of the present8Uuation on Merseyside.    The area has over the past few months suffered asPate of redundancies (notably British Leyland&apos;s plant at Speke), the unemploy-jrient rate is currently 11. 1 per cent (male 12.9 per cent) and in Kirkby thecal situation is much worse than this.    At its recent meeting with the Primemister a delegation from the Liverpool City Council was told that the0vernmentwere fully aware of Merseyside1 s problems and would do what theyQuld to help.    This means that news that Government help for KME had been^thheld, with the result that the firm had to close and make its whole^Qrkforce redundant, would be particularly ill-received.
I accept that the Government have been unable to do anything aboutmost of the recent closures on Merseyside, but this seems to me to be no good reason why we should accept redundancies which we can prevent. Iwould urge my Cabinet colleagues to reconsider the majority decision of el for the reasons I have stated, bearing in mind also the social problems which are building up alarmingly on Merseyside as the result of its very high unemployment.A E BDepartment of Employment9 May 19782
