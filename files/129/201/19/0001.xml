DOCTJMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS government cp(78) 69 OACOPY NO27 June 1978CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE, 1979-80 TO 1982-83Memorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury. In this year&apos;s public expenditure review, we need to take firm decisions for 1979-80 and provisional decisions for 1980-81, 1981-82 and1982-83,    The factual material is set out in the survey report by officials,which I am circulating separately (CP(78) 67).2. We should decide as much as we can, especially about 1979-80, beforethe summer recess.    This will enable Departments to prepare in an orderlyway for the rate support grant negotiations in November and the 1979-80Estimates and cash limits.THE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE total. The Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s paper (CP(78) 68) concludes that over the next two years, 1979-80 and 1980-81, we must hold to the planningtotals in last January1 s White Paper (Cmnd 7049), which implied growth ofabout 2 per cent in each year, and that for the later years we should againproject annual growth of 2 per cent as a prudent maximum.    I start from this conclusion.4. If Departments succeed in reducing shortfall over the years ahead, asis expected to happen in the current year, actual expenditure will then continueto grow faster than the planning figures.    But I do not propose scaling down the 2 per cent growth path of the planning figures on that account:  the amounts of shortfall from year to year are too unpredictable.IMPLICATIONS FOR PROGRAMMES:   1979-80 AND 1980-815. The expenditure planning totals for the next two years, as they nowstand, lie some way below the totals in January&apos;s White Paper (see Annex A,lines 1-3).    This is mainly due to reductions in the estimated financingrequirements of nationalised industries.    These are inevitably uncertain.Departments have also found some useful &quot;good housekeeping1 savings, in response to the Civil Service Departments recent exercise.6. The &quot;headroom&quot; shown in line 3 of Annex A means that we can add 365 million to the 1979-80 planning figures and  424 million to the 1980-81figures without exceeding the White Paper totals.
7. But this &quot;headroom1 is more than used up over the next two years by -a. estimating changes on demand-responsive programmes,particularly social security and housing subsidies, which it may be impracticable or inappropriate to offset fully by savings in the sameDepartments programmes (see Annex A, line 4 and Annex B); and b. the new employment scheme concerning short time working(or some equivalent scheme), to which we are effectively committed(see Annex A, line 5).These unavoidable increases leave us with excesses over the White Papertotals in both 1979-80 and 1980-81 (Annex A, line 6).    (The estimatingchanges in line 4 may be revised between now and October.)8. Hence keeping to the announced path for the total will leave no scope for other net additions to expenditure in the next two years.     In thesecircumstances I suggest that, with such re-ordering of priorities as isnecessary, each Department should contain its other requirements within its existing provieion in the survey baseline.9. This will clearly be difficult.    The bids proposed by Departments inthe survey report, including those mentioned in paragraph 7, amount to 1.8 billion in 1979-80 and  2.4 billion in 1980-81 (Annex A, line 7, and annex C).    Many of the individual bids are attractive, and I recognise thatthere will be pressure on us to make announcements about particularprogrammes over the next few months.    But we stand to lose much more from any appearance of slackening control of expenditure than we stand to gain from promises of extra expenditure on individual programmes. our recent experience of market reactions illustrates the importance of maintaining the credit we have gained from bringing public expenditure under control.10. The policy of holding the published totals need not necessarily rule out some increases in priority areas, provided they can be matched bysavings.    Within a public expenditure total of the order of  65 billion a year it must be possible to make room for some changes in this way.IMPLICATIONS FOR PROGRAMMES:   1981-82 AND 1982-8311. In the two final years of the survey period, there is room for someadditions to expenditure within a 2 per cent growth path, even after allowing for estimating changes on demand-re sponsive services and the short time working scheme (see Annex A, line 6).    We shall have to consider prioritiesThe total of additional bids put forward exceeds the remaining headroom by 2^ billion in each year.    And the figures include no allowance for any increase in child benefit after 1979-80.2
CONCLUSIONS12.       In accordance with the Chancellors conclusion that we should stickto the White Paper totals for 1979-80 and 1980-81, implying growth of some per cent in each year, and plan provisionally for growth of not more than2 per cent a year in the two subsequent years, I propose that we:-i.       For 1979-80 and 1980-81 -a. agree the planning totals in line 1 of Annex A;b. agree that there should be net additions to programmes to cover estimating changes on demand responsive servicesand the new employment scheme, to the extent that thesecannot be contained within the programmes concerned(lines 4 and 5 of Annex A);c. agree on how to eliminate any remaining excess(line 6 of Annex A);d. to the extent that any other of the claims in Annex Care accepted, identify offsetting savings.ii.       For 1981-82 and 1982-83 -e. agree the planning totals in line 1 of Annex A;f. agree that there should be net additions to programmes to cover estimating changes on demand responsive servicesand the new employment scheme, to the extent that thesecannot be contained within the programmes concerned (lines4 and 5 of Annex A);g. agree that I should discuss with the Ministers concernedpriorities within their bids with a view to bringing back to cabinet in the autumn detailed proposals for alloacting the limited headroom available (line 6 of Annex A).J treasury Chambers27 June 1978
