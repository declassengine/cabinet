IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 56COPY no May 1978CABINETKIRKBY MANUFACTURING AND ENGINEERINGCOMPANY LIMITEDNote by the Secretary of State for industry. I attach a paper by the Minister of State, Department of Industry,about Government assistance to Kirkby Manufacturing and Engineering(KME).    It was discussed by the Ministerial Committee on Economic andIndustrial Policy (El) on 5 May,    A large majority of the Committee feltthat no further assistance should be given to the company.    A minoritythought that there was still a case for continued support.    I understandthat the Secretary of State for Employment is circulating a paper setting out his arguments for this course.2. The main points made at El were these.For further assistance -a. The report from PA Management Consultants Limitedindicates the prospect of small profits.b. The political commitment to the success of workerco-operatives.c. The fact that closure costs (at  2.9 million) are almost exactly equal to the proposed further support;   taking the costs of unemployment into account it would be cheaper to continuesupport.d. The problems of Meroycide in general, and of Kirkby inparticular are such that we ohould not let 650 jobs go.Against further support -e. The Consultants&apos; report was very optimistic and did not take full account of the company&apos;s market position or of itscompetitors1 plans.    (These competitors include the Welshcompany Peniad which is being given further support by the welsh Development Agency and the Welsh Office after itscollapse in 1977.)1
f. The Industrial Develop*-nent Advisory Board unanimouslyrejected KME&apos;s application for further assistance.    If furtheraid is given, we must therefore be prepared for the IndustrialDevelopment Agency Board to exercise its rights under Section 9(4)of the Industry Act 1972, requiring me to make a statement to theHouse.g. Even with further assistance the company will be unable to repay past advances and will not generate enough new cash to finance fresh investment;  it is thus not viable now, and wil?. not become so in the longer term.h. The cost per job is much higher than we should normally be prepared to pay,i. We have twice given support to the company on a publicly announced &quot;once only  basis, and since the last tranche of help,have publicly turned down two further applications for assistance.We shall lack credibility if we now give further support.j.        It is difficult to distinguish KME from other companies inassisted areas:   why help KME when we were forced to let Spekeand Western Ship Repairers go?k.       There is a chance cf saving some of the jobs at Kirkby ifanother company in the same field which is known to be seeking a site, can be persuaded to move to the area.    We will not knowone way or the other though before the end of May.3. The Committee decided, subject to Cabinet&apos;s decision, against further support.    I should add, on the basis of the Attorney Genera?&apos;advice at El, that we should not delay a decision lest our action shouldinduce the company to go on trading when it-is no longer viable.   To do so would risk leaving the Government with responsibility for meeting thecompany&apos;s debts when it collapses.    If we do decide on further supportthe Attorney General stressed that we should avoid giving even the leastimpression that the company was viable oi would become viable.E G V Department of industry May 1978
APPLICATION FOR FURTHER INDUSTRY ACT ASSISTANCE TO KIRIG3YMANUFACTURING AND ENGINEERING COMPANY LIMITED (KME)Memorandum by the Minister  of State for IndustryAssistance ReGuested1 KME has submitted a further application for assistance under Section 7 of the Industry Act 1972.   The request is forthe sum  2.9m to meet KME&apos;s fixed and working capital require-Eents up to 31 March 1981 and includes  820,000 to repay the tank overdraft.background The Committee will recall that KME has already receivedtwo tranches of assistance under Section 7&apos; an initial grant^  3.9m in 1974 and an additional grant of  860,000 in 1977, eachon the understanding that no further assistance would be forthcoming.    In addition Temporary Employment Subsidy of 681,000 was paid to KME in 1976/77 making total assistance from public funds of  5.44m.3 The Committee also considered on 12 October a furtherapplication for assistance of between  3m- 6m and concluded- 1 -
that this could not be Justified because the proposals lackedviability.    KNE subsequently submitted a slightly revisedapplication on 18 October, but members of the Committee agreed in correspondence that is was not essentially different fromthe previous proposals and confirmed their view that assistance should be refused. resent Applications     In support of the current application KME have submitted adeport which they have commissioned from PA Management Consultants^td (PA).    This considers the market for each of KME&apos;s continuingProduct areas and assesses the company!s productive capacity.The report suggest a strategy for KME to achieve profitabilitysets out forecasts of the results of KME&quot;a operations and ofits cash flow and capital requirements for the period to31 March 1981.   The summary and conclusion of that report areat Annex 1 with a brief comment by Department of Industry officials on some of the crucial factors       at Annex 2.The main elements in the company&apos;s plans are not significantlydifferent from those that the Committee considered last Autumn.*t is planned to close the major loss-making lines r food and*iGht storage heaters - making 130 people redundant and eliminatinglosses running at the rate of around  700,000 per annum. AlthoughProduction has more or less stopped, these redundancies have not&quot;Deen implemented pending a decision on further assistance. TheQther product areas (Accadiair ventilators, contract presswork
and radiators) will continue, providing employment for 64-5People, and the PA report assumes substantial growth in sales.6        It is clear from Annex 2 that officials have serious doubts about a number of the assumptions on which the forecasts are&quot;based.   They have these doubts because the Accadiair sales arecritically dependent on the satisfactory production and marketing of a new slim-line model.   While development work is quite well advanced, there may be delays in putting it into full productionand the ultimate acceptability of the product to its customershas yet to be established.   They are also concerned that inthe meantime there could be difficulties in maintaining salesQf the existing model.   In contract presswork the market is highly competitive and KKE is unfortunately not well placed,since it is not equipped for tooling up for special orders.7      The most important of the company&apos;s products is, however,radiators and here again my officials doubt KME&apos;s ability to achieve forecast results.   These assume that the present^oyancy in the market will continue and that KH2&apos;s market sharebe maintained.   This takes no account of investment plans of other companies (about which we have received information in confidence), some of which will come on stream in 6-9 monthstime.   With relatively inadequate product development thissuggests that KME&apos;s market share will gradually diminish andtfcat the substantial increase in sales forecast in the report willnot be sustained.
mm3        KME&apos;s past record of trading losses - (15 months to31 March 1976  1.5m, year ended 31 March 1977  1.1m, year ended31 March 1978 estimated  1.4m) - and repeated failures to matchforecasts with perforulance do not inspire confidence this time.Members of the Committee will make their own judgement betweenthe outside view of PA that the assumptions in the report areconservative and the view of Department of Industry officialsthat the forecasts are over optimistic.Advice of the Industrial Development Advisory Board (IDAB)9      The application was considered &quot;by IDAB on 27 April. Asummary of the paper presented to the Board is at Annex 3 and aaote of the Board1s conclusion is at Annex 4.    IDAB&apos;s advice isSuite unequivocal and the Board unanimously and strongly urges&quot;that further assistance would not be justified for lack ofviability of the proposals.   We must therefore be prepared for1MB to exercise its rights under section 9(4) of the industry act 1972, requiring the Secretary of State to make a statement to the House, if we decided to give further assistance to KME.lavementno    Before receiving Hffi^s advice, I met the directors of KMEto give them an opportunity to bring to my attention any additionalActors that they wanted us to consider.   They assured me of theirintontion to implement the strategy in the PA report, includingrecommendations for the appointment of a new chief executive
and non. executive chairman as well as other changes in themanagement structure.   It is important to find men of the rightcalibre, although PA believe they have two suitable employeeswhom they would be willing to second to KME for a period.Economic Considerations11    The unemployment situation in Kirkby and in Merseyside asa whole continues to be a matter of serious concern. TheCommittee is aware of demands for special action to be taken toPrevent further industrial decay in the area and finding alternativedeb opportunities in the area remains far from easy.   On the wider economic implications, the temporary increase in importsoccasioned by KM &apos;s closure would be more or less balanced byefficiency gains of transferring production to more efficientUK competitors.   The net exchequer effects of closure would alsofce broadly neutral, the estimated costs of redundancy and^employment benefits etc. being roughly equivalent to the  2.9massistance requested.   However, unless KME achieved the resultsit forecasts, the assistance would only be preserving jobstemporarily and the costs associated with closure would only be postponed.   And, if equivalent assistance were given to other projects currently being considered for Merseyside, more permanent gains in employment opportunities in the area might^e obtained.
12    As on previous occasions the Committee is faced with anun-attractive choice.   The only case for supporting KME ison social grounds, but those remain strong.    If we refuse toassist KME, it is unlikely that ifsbankers will continue tosupport it much longer and the directors would in any casenave to consider their personal position in relation to Section 332of the Companies Act 19^8.    In addition to the 130 people dueto be made redundant anyway, closure of the company -would leadto the loss of a further 64-5 jobs in the Merseyside (a SpecialDevelopment Area) where male unemployment is already 13-5%. Onthe other hand to assist an enterprise which, in the view of officials and IDAB, had no prospects of viability would breachour criteria for financial assistance.   Ve would be setting asideagain our statement that previous assistance to KME was &quot;once for all&quot;, with every likelihood of being faced with further^quests for assistance in the future.   And it would make it more difficult to apply our normal criteria in dealing withother applications without encountering charges of unequaltreatment.   Assistance would of course require prior clearance^ith the e.c. Commission.15    I invite my colleagues views on this application fordistance.^epartnent of Industry A V
ANNEX ISUmARY OF PA CONSULTANTS REPORTOver the past three months vc have completed a comprehensive appraisalo* the Kirkby Manufacturing ond Engineering Company Limited.   As aresult of this appraisal it is our opinion that providing the employeesat all levels arc prepared to accept their normal responsibilities theCompany can earn a trading profit in the financial year commencingApril 1st 1978.preparing this forecast vc have adopted a conservative approach andit is possible that in some areas we may have been too pessimistic.However, in view of the Company&apos;s failure to achieve previous forecasts,* consider it essential on this occasion to err on the side of caution.Thc forecast incorporates a number of key assumptions which must beconsidered when assessing its validity.   These are detailed below alongvUh a summary of the evidence to support the assumption.1*     Radiator production and sales will be held at an average12,000 units per week until 31st December 1978 and there-after at 12,200 units per week.In our earlier report we accepted that it should be possibleto sell at least 12,500 units per week.    A more detailedsurvey of the market has convinced us that sales could infact exceed 13,000 units per week.Production of radiators in reqent weeks has averaged 12,900radiators.    However we have reservations about this levelbeing sustained over a period of a year.    Therefore, wehave based our forecast upon an output of only 12,000 units for the &quot;first 9 months and 12,200 for the remaining 3 months,
2,     Ail increase in radiator prices of in real termswill&apos;not reduce the demand below the level of 12,000\inits per week.Our research indicated that KME prices were approximately2Jo below competitors levels.    Demand since October liasaveraged over 13,000 units per week which is well inexcess of the planned requirement.    Consequently a realprice increase slightly above 2Jo is unlikely to reducedemand by more than 7o$*3*     Increases   in material and payroll costs can be passed onin increased prices.tiCompetitors arc seeking price increase approval on chesegrounds.h,     Accadiair production and sales will total 2*1,000 units overthe year.Actual sales in 1977 were 2-&apos;i,000 units but the Chairmanof Accadiair expects to sell over 3ujO00 units in thecoming financial year.    Production facilities arc capableof providing in excess of this 3uj000 level.5*      The price of the Accadiair will increase by  2.50 per unitat 1*4*78 and by a corresponding amount in October 1978*The proposed increases have already been put to theAccadiair Directors and has been accepted in principle.
Contract press-work will total  800,000 in 1978/79 withcontribution averaging &apos;i6jo.In the calendar year 1977* Contract Press-work sales totalled 65&apos;jfOOO anil provided a contribution to labour, overheadsand profits of 50Jo.    These figures would undoubtedly havebeen higher but for the strike at British Ley]and - Spckcin the latter part of 1977.    The Company has recently beengranted MOD approval and this should generate some additionalsales.The Constor and Food lines will be closed at 31*3*78 andthe total labour force will be reduced to 6&apos;i5 persons.An announcement of these closures lias been made end the reduced complement agreed with the General Manager.The spare factory space resulting from these closures willbe cleared by the end of June 1978 and a reduction in rates will be obtained.Knowslcy UDC have agreed in principle to a rate reductionproviding the spare area is completely sealed off from theremainder of the factory.The Constor and Foods operations will be sold at a price that provides about 50$ of stock values.A number of enquires I avc already been received and discussionsarc taking place.    If the operations can be sold as on-going activities then a much higher price may be realised.
10.     The Board and senior management will be strengthened bythe appointment of a non-executive Chairman and thesecondment of a Chief Management Ilxecutive.We believe these appointments to be essential if the company is to achieve the planned turn-around in 1978/79. Thisis not a criticism of the existing management but simply&quot;a recognition of the size of the task involved.Based upon these assumptions, Wc are forecasting that the Company willjust pass the break-even point on trading in 1978/79.   We should mention,however, that if discussions now being held with the landlord resultin a reduction in the annual building rental, proportionate to thereduction in factory space used, then the profit should reach - 50,000Whilst this &quot;is obviously a modest return on an investment which alreadytotals  &apos;i.76 million, it does represent a massive turn-round whencontrasted with the loss of  1.24 million recorded in the first 10months of the current financial year.   To achieve this improvement anumber of major changes will have to be made which will involve thecompany in additional &apos;oncc-off costs.    We estimate that these costs*ill total: 2*15,000*t is expected that all of this cost can be met from the proceedsarising from the sale of the Constor and Food operations. Howeverthese proceeds may not be realised in time to meet some of the largertransitional costs and consequently it would be prudent to arrangeioan facilities tp. provide temporary finance for the transition.
The cash position has been critical for some months and it is anticipatedthat by the end of March 1973 the overdraft could reach  820,000, com-porcd with a limit of  830,000 recently agreed by National WestminsterBank.    \;c nave produced a forecast for 1978/79 which:assumes ilia t the proceeds from the sale of theConstor and Food operations be used to meettransitional costsassumes a rise in stock and debtor levels in line with sales of the retained productsignores capital expenditure requirements.&quot;it. demonstrate, that the overdraft is likely to reach  968,000 in June1978 and despite some improvement in the subsequent months will rise to 1*us,000 at &quot;the end of March 1979.* this figure must be added the capital expenditure requirement, whichin 1978/79 is forecast at  187,000.   This brings the probable cashMortage at the end of 1978/79 to 1,332,000Poking beyond 1978/79 we believe that profits in 1979/80 should rise*0  208,000, given only modest increases in productivity.    In 19S0/81U further increase to  285,000 should be attainable if the re-equipment^lo6rainme pi aimed for the next three years, is instituted.    Ilowcvcr, it^Pears that during the period 1979/81 the cash generated from profits0r allowing for depreciation) is unlikely to exceed  773*00^* ofall but  30,000 will be required to finance the additional stocksdebtors required to service the extra sales.    This means that an^tional  1,296,000 will have to be obtained to finance the programme^  capital expenditure which is essential to the Company&apos;s long termeVolopment.
In summary, you require a minimum cash input of  2,628,000, and it wouldbe prudent to allow a further to cover short term fluctuations indebtor and stock levels.    This brings the total requirement to:f2,Q00t00QIbis cash would be used to:Finance capital expenditure -  1,513*000Finance working capital -        567,000Tay off the Bank loan -        820,000*t would enable KME to get away from the &quot;hand to mouth&quot; cash situation*hich has been a permanent feature of the last years trading and tor*Place that part of the plant which is approaching the end of itsuseful life.no vay however will this cash have the effect of enabling the managc-*cnt and shop floor workers of KME to avoid the realities of businessThe need for sustained high levels of productivity still remainsalo&quot;6 with the need to obtain sales and control stock and debtor levels.Those tasks arc the responsibility of every employee at KME and ultimately the future prosperity of the Company rests in their hands.
16. CONCLUSIONSince vc prepared our initial report in December 1977, there bus un-doubtedly been a change in the atmosphere at KME.   This change is evident not only in tltc improved tempo on the production lines butalso in the mere positive and confident approach of management atall levels.    The drive and enthusiasm always evident in the directorsand senior managers has spread throughout the Company.Maintaining this approach is the main task facing management.    If this can be achieved then we are confident that the forecasts contained in report will be met.this^thusiasm however is not everything and if KME is to survive an early^put of cash is essential.    This will enable the Company to effect the changes required if it is to become profitable.   Without that cash it / * doubtful whether the Company can continue to trade for very long.
officials&apos; critique of pa reportPA&apos;s brief was to advise on a future viable strategy forthe co-ooerasive. . Their report examines each of tneproposed&quot; continuing operations and concludes in1977/78 a break even position can be attained, f?llowedby profits of  205,000 and  285,000 in each of the succeeding years.   The main points of the report are summarised below with officials&apos; comments :-RadiatorsThore is presently a boom in the radiator marketfollowing&apos; the 30C strike last autumn and an increase in new housing starts.   PA feel-that the critical constraint onsales is likely to be production.   Productivity has improvedir* recent weeks following a meeting of co-operativemembers at which the seriousness of the situation wase*dained.    PA stress that this commitment must be maintained.PA forecasts assume a 26% increase in production and sales in 1973/79 and a further 40 increase per annum there-after.^o risks are that:-(a) a 26% increase may be optimistic since it is basedon order levels subject to &quot;double-ordering iecustomers placing the same order with two or moresuppliers and only taking delivery from the firstavailable\(b) the present boom is likely to be temporary but the4% increase for 1980 and 1981 is built on to a base of the 26% increase reflecting the present boom.Co)(d)commitment of the workforce may not be maintained,^resent production levels have never previously been achieved and sustained;Increases in capacity planned by competing UK manu-facturers to come on stream in the next six to nine months have not been taken into account by PA.as iqnS^317 that sales levels in 1978/79 will be the samePfod&apos; Although the report recognised the need foraS3uaC^--evelopment in this area, the forecast made notha^?i10n as to the introduction of a new model other thanU^if. y- such a product came on stream it would replace,*or unit, sales of the old model.
^fce model now being developed appears to meet all marketRequirements.    However, pa and KME now accept that unless it is in production by early July, the forecast will not e met.     KME believe this production can be achieved but^ir?laVe 3^ated that, in their opinion, losses up to^100,000 could be suffered as a result of possible delaysln Pitting this new model into production.Contract Presswork^he forecasts assume that almost all presswork capacitynot^utilised by radiator production will be used by sub-contract work.    PA believe this is possible following MoDapproval and a recent increase in orders from GKN.^he forecast represents an increase in contract presswork01 20% over 1977/78.    In a highly competitive and volatileMarket the achievement of such an increase must be uncertain,Particularly in view of the fact that no sales force existsand KME do not have the facility to tool-up for specialooos.&quot;das   Consider that management must be strengthened at senior^d middle levels if the strategy is to succeed.    The most.mPortant; vacancy is that of chief executive.    Since the^ssue of their report, they have stated that two suitableandidates for this position are available from withinueir organisation on a secondment basis.    No candidatesave been identified for the middle management positions.* should be borne in mind that the present directors havev^rong personalities and the chief executive could findJs task difficult.   Recruitment in other areas is problem-Alcal given the co-operatives low pay structure ar.d poor,J0Q security.^ lemeno-ation of the plan0 e -forecasts assume that an action plan was implementedJ? i April 1978.    This plan includes price rises, thel^nSUre 0*&apos; loss-making operations with the consequence of30 redundancies and management recruitment.- .Ve delayed the introduction of this plan until aa crsion is taken by HMG on the provision of further^Slstance.    This action is understandable but is costing16 co-operative in the region of  15,000 per week. $ elusionWit-2 ac&quot;^on plan, if successfully implemented, would deala many of the weaknesses which have been apparent inP0? 2Q&quot;&quot;0Perative since its inception.   However the following&amp;ts must be considered:-2
even if all went well the strategy does notdemonstrate a rate of return likely to generatesufficient cash to finance future capital requirement in view of the risks identified above and the delay in implementation of the plan, the forecasts mustbe considered optimistic;on the basis of its past record (trading losses of 1.5m in the fifteen months to end March 1976, 1.1m for 1977 and  1.4-m for 1978) there must be serious doubts as to the ability of the enterpriseto carry through the plan successfully or makethe business viable in the longer term;although the losses of the lines to be discontinued(orange Juice and Constor heaters) are running at 700,000 pa and would be eliminated by closure ofthese activities, the losses on the remainingoperations are running at a similar annual levelduring the past 3i- years.-3-
KIRK3T MA:?J?ACTURING AND ENGINEERING CO LTDSECTION 7,  CATEGORY C. INDUSTRY ACT 197?SUMMARYI ASSISTANCE REQUESTED:    Immediate assistancetotalling  2,900,000 to avoid receivership and preserve645 jobs in Kirkby, Merseyside - a Special Development Area.This application is in addition to &apos;once and for all1 grants and Temporary Employment Subsidy received as follows:- 000Initial grant 1974 3,900Additional grant 1977 860TES in 1976 and 1977 6815,441II DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS:    The manufacture of domesticradiators, night storage heaters and ventilators and contractpresswork mainly for the motor industry and the blending of fruit Juices.III PROPOSAL:    A future strategy for the co-operativehas been prepared by PA Management Consultants. this involves the closure of the major loss-makers, storageheaters and fruit juices, resulting in 130 redundancies;recruitment of senior and middle management; taking actionto strengthen the market position and remaining production facilities of the co-operative.    The cost of this operation is estimated at:- 000Finance capital expenditure 1,51.3Finance working capital 567Pay off bank overdraft 8202,900A further  1 million of assistance could be required ifHHG were to purchase the presently leased factory for KNEas has tentatively been suggested.Except for the recommendations regarding management this plan is broadly the same as the one which formed the basisof KNE&apos;s lass application in October 1977 and which was rejected by IDAB as not being viable.IV VIABILITY:    IDAB has nor in the past consideredthat the business has potential viability.    The tradingloss of KME for the year ended 51 March 1978 is expected
to be in the region of  1.4m (1977 trading loss  1.1m,15 inoilths to end March 1976 trading loss of  1.5n). Theplan shows KME breaking even in 1978/9 and making orofitsof  2C5,OCO and  285,000 in the two following years.The plan requires a substantial contraction of operations,management changes, including the appointment of a secondedchief executive, and the complete and sustained commitment of the co-operative members, the outcome of all of which is uncertain.    There are underlying the forecasts a range ofassumptions which could well prove difficult to activate.For example, the contraction and redundancy plan, price increases and the search for a new chief executive were due to be put into effect on 1 April 1978 and have been deferred pending a decision by HMG on financial assistance,with consequent increases in costs.The level of radiator production assumed in the forecast hasbeen achieved only in the last two months and it must be doubtful whether this would continue during a period whenthe workforce as a whole is being reduced.    In any case,although the radiator market is buoyant at the moment,investment already in hand by other UK manufacturers will come on-stream shortly and with inadequate production develop-ment KME is likely to find its market share declining.The Accadiair sales are heavily dependent on the development and successful marketing of a new slim-line model.    And the contract presswork, which is assumed in the PA reportto be running at almost full capacity utilisation, is in a highly competitive field and the forecasts appear veryoptimistic.Taking all these factors into account, it must remain unlikelygiven previous performance, that KNE can achieve viability.V EMPLOYMENT:    Kirkby has exceptionally high unemploymentwithin the Liverpool travel-to-work area which itself has 11.5%unemployment compared with the national average of 6.8%.In the event of receivership, the 64-5 jobs saved under theplan would be lost with little prospect of reemployment inthe medium term, apart from 100 semi-skilled workers who could possibly find other jobs.If the proposal is implemented, KNE would make approximately130 of the 775 members of the co-operative redundant with little prospect of re-employment elsewhere.KHE have complied with the Governments anit-inflation policy.VI INDUSTRIAL CONSIDERATIONS:      The closure of KMEmay contribute to the possibility of imports&apos; of radiators inthe short term because of a lack of capacity.   Projects nowunderway will rectify this situation within a year, however,and there are no underlying industrial grounds for support.
VII EXCHEQUER AND RESOURCE COST:    It is estimated thatthe closure of KME would have neutral consequences from aresource cost benefit analysis.The Exchequer costs of closure are estimated to amount toa maximum of some  3-3*m over the next three years andare thus broadly equal to the assistance proposed.VIII CONCLUSION:    The prospect of wWivebecoming commercially viable is remote.   Altnough the.e isJ substantial case for giving support on social groundsit is considered that this application does not meet the criteria and that this request for assistance   which couldinvolve an open-ended commitment, should be refused.
CONFIDENTIALANNEXINDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT ADVISORY BOARD6TH MEETING 2? APRIL 1978SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONSkkeShe Board noted that the Company had already obtained 5.4M in Government financial support, the bull, on aonce for all&quot; basis , and the company had persistentlyfailed to fulfil   its forecasts.   The current P^P?^*as essentially the same as had previously ^en submittedto the Board, the same basic weaknesses remained and the?oard considered the proposal was not a viable P^PO8^0?;Unilst recognising the efforts made by the workforce and the severe ennlfyment and social problems of the area, the Boardunanimously ^strongly urged that further assistance would*ot be justified under the Government&apos;s criteria.Board further considered that one of thWessons*i this case was that an essential part ?f        5f f.!1!^^of co-operatives should be the freedom of &quot;^eis^ra^cana5ement if performance is inadequate, and the importanceof exercising this freedom should be stressed.
