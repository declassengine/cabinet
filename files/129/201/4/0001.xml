DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 54 COPY NO 808 May 1978CABINETFINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR 16-18-YEAR-OLDS IN FULL-TIMEEDUCATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. On 23 June 1977 (CM(77) 23rd Conclusions, Minute 3) the cabinet endorsed a proposal that there should be a study by officials of support arrangements for those continuing full-time education beyond school-leaving age.2. The Home and Social Affairs Committee (HS) have recentlyconsidered this report - of which the summary and conclusions areannexed - together with proposals by the Secretary of State for Education and science and Paymaster General for a scheme of mandatory awards based on one of the options presented in the report.PROPOSALS3. The Secretary of State for Education and Science and paymaster general proposes a means-tested scheme, with maximum awards of  9 perweek for those staying on in further education (FE) and  7 per week for those staying on in school;  the differential reflects benefits in kind, egmeals and books, received by school pupils.    Maximum awards would bepaid for children from families on supplementary benefit (SB) or equivalentincome, with the means test reducing those progressively to zero a littlebelow the median income (currently about  4, 500) of families with childrenaged 16-19.    The awards, administered by local authorities, would attract90 per cent central Government grant.    They would be payable, whether tothe parents or young person direct, on top of the  4 Child Benefit which is tocome into force next year.EFFECTS AND COSTS4. It is estimated that such a scheme would attract an additional 45, 000young people in England and Wales to continue in full-time education, ofwhich half would opt for FE.    Because of means testing all the new1
participants would be from lower income groups, with some two-thirds ofthe gross expenditure incurred going to the poorest 25 per cent of families.5. The additional gross recurrent costs (including education costs)would be about  100 million per annum.    There would also be once-and-for-all capital costs (to provide extra places) of about  78 million.    In addition -and it might be regarded as an inevitable consequence if mandatory awardswere introduced for 16-18-year-olds - the Secretary of State for education and Science and Paymaster General would like to introduce mandatoryawards at higher education rates, involving an additional cost of  20 million per annum, for some 25, 000 home students aged 19-plus, who are atpresent eligible only for discretionary awards.     The costs of the scheme for16-18-year-olds make no allowance for possible savings on SB payments tostudents and teachers who would otherwise be unemployed, currentlyestimated at  24 million per annum.6. Excluding possible SB savings on the one hand and the 19-plus costson the other, the annual per capita cost of the scheme for 16-18-year-olds,attributed wholly to the additional participants in full-time education, wouldbe about  3, 000 per annum in the first four years, dropping to  2, 575thereafter when the capital costs had been met.CONSULTATIONS WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES7. The Secretary of State for Education and Science and paymaster general wishes to enter into early consultations with local authorities on thebasis of a declared commitment to a mandatory scheme of awards but without commitment to the level of awards.    This would enable her to formulate precise proposals in good time for the introduction of legislationnext Session or for prior announcement at a General Election.DISCUSSION8. A majority of HS supported the Secretary of State for Education and science and Paymaster general s proposals.    Apart from the views of theNational Executive Committee and references in Labour Party programmes,there have been strong representations from the Trades Union Congress fora mandatory scheme of awards for 16-18-year-olds;   and before the recentelections the Association of Metropolitan Authorities had been pressing for amore generous system.    Particular concern has been expressed about theanomaly whereby young people in Manpower Services Commissionprogrammes receive an allowance of  19. 50 per week while theircontemporaries in full-time education are receiving little or nothing (theaverage discretionary award for FE amounts to  2. 20 per week coveringonly 10 per cent of students).    Contrasted also with the higher educationsystem of support, the 16-18 age group in full-time education faresparticularly badly.    It was also strongly argued in HS that the loss ofvaluable skills, through the proportionately low level of participation incontinued education of the lower socio-economic groups, should no longer be tolerated.
9. Against this, it was argued that thsre was already a clear upward trend in the proportion of 16-18-year-olds staying on (an estimated 33. 5 percent in 1981-82 compared with 30 per cent today), and that the scheme wouldhave a low cost-effectiveness, with 80 per cent of the awards (though 70 percent of the money) going to young people who would have stayed on anywayand with the proportion of stayers-on rising by only two percentage points.More fundamentally scepticism was expressed whether it would be an effective or worthwhile exercise to seek to offer financial inducements as a means of persuading 16-year-olds to stay on, many of wh)m would be poorlymotivated towards education, particularly school education from which therehad been a substantial alienation of young people.    In this connection it wassuggested that a hard look needed to be taken at the whole system of educational provision for 16-18-year-olds;   arguably this had an inbuilt biasin favour of the professional and middle classes which in the long run could bebuttressed by a mandatory scheme of payments.10. The Chief Secretary, Treasury, was opposed tc any declaredcommitment, in advance of this year&apos;s public expenditure survey, to a new scheme which would involve a new and continuing addition to public expenditure.CONCLUSIONS11. The Cabinet are invited to consider -a. whether, as a majority of HS favoured, there should be anearly Government commitment to a mandatory system of means-tested awards for 16-18-year-olds in full-time education as a basis for consultations with local authorities about the details of such ascheme, including a possible range of award levels; orb. if not, whether discussions with local authorities on improving the present arrangements should be entered into without commitment on the part of the Government to any statutory change in those arrangements, leaving the possibility of a statutory scheme to beconsidered further in the light of those consultations.M RHome Office8 May 19783
ANNEXEDUCATION SUPPORT FOR 16-18 YEAR OLDSGEM 93 REPORT: SUMMARY AND conclusions*     The context of the decision by Ministers to institute an examination&quot;by officials of the support arrangements for those continuing theireducation beyond school leaving age, was the likely impact of the manpower Services Commission (MSC) reoomronded programme of training and work experience opportunities for young people and the possible need fora complementary education initiative.   This is reflected in the Group&apos;sterns of reference which required us to take into aocount a wide range of relevant factors.2. The family support and social security systems arc designed toProvide against hardship, differentiating in some measure between those under 16 and those over 16 in full-time education.   In Digland and Waleseducational maintenance allowances (EhUa) for school children and the maintenanceeleneut *f discriminatory grants (2Grf) for further education (FE) students have notfceen wiiely or consistently used.    (There has fceen less occasion for criticism on either of these tounts in Scotland where the awards are discretionary but followPrescribed scales.)3. There is a clear trend towards increased staying on in full-timeeducation:    it is estimated that by 1981-82 about one-third of tho 16-10 agogroup over school leaving age (and about half the 16 year olds) will bein full-time education.   There is no clear economic cr other yardstick bywhich to judge whether the overall trend is satisfactory.   There is acorrelation between staying on and the socio-economic group of the fatherancl, less marked, tho family income group.4. Recent criticisms have focussed on tho lack of a sufficient financialincentive to continue in full-time education, as compared with payments under the ISC programme and, to some extent, the level of supplementary&quot;enofit (SB) payments for the unemployed.   The principal short-torm economicalternative to stajTing on is to get paid employment.     In theoorvtcxt of alternative choices, however, a high rate ofunemployment is likely to reduce the attractiveness of paid^ployment since there is less certainty of its availability. The1
incentive to stay on in full-time education is therefore increased: andthis is reflected in the forecast figures for staying on rates in 1981-82,This incentive would obviously be greater were it not for the &quot;safety net&quot;of social security benefits for the unemployed.   The Group do not see these benefits as a direct disincentive to remain in full-time education but theymay act, in some measure, as a disincentive to return to full-timeeducation, particularly perhaps in the case of those who draw SB afterleaving school and have not found employment by September.5*     Because MSC training courses usually last for a relatively short period and the programme is aimed particularly at the unqualified and poorlymotivated (with no guarantee of a place except after the best part of ayear of unemployment), it is questionable whether this programme and thepayments under it will have more than a marginal influence on decisions toleave full-time education.   There could however be difficulties, in theabsence of comparable payments, where unemployed young people wished tomove from the programme into EE.6.     Criticisms of the present system also reflect a more general concern that 16 year olds from families in lower income groups do not in practicehave the same educational opportunities as those in higher income groups.This concern can be translated into two possible objectives of educationsupport which to some extent overlap:   to prevent hardship for those stayingon and to provide a financial incentive to stay on.   Some reduction in umemployment would be a by-product of increased staying on. Measuresdirected towards cither of these objectives should, in the Group1s view,bo means-tested both because of the cost implications of doing otherwiseand because more children of better off families stay on anyway; and measuresdirected to the second objective should involve a payment to the pupil(whether or not conjoined with a payment to the parent).7*     If the objective of education support is simply to prevent hardship,&quot;there is a case for abolishing EMAs and the maintenance element of DGs asanachronistic in the light of the development since 1944 of the familysupport and social security systems and of their potential for further2
development (Option A).   There would &quot;be obvious prosentational difficultiesin this course which might however be reduced if it were to coincide witha substantial increase in other forms of family support.   Because of thecost and other implications, however, changes in the family support and social security systems would not be the right way of providing an incentive to continued full-time education;   nor would the young be likely to perceivesuch changes as an incentive.o&quot;.     A system of mandatory awards (Option B) would be addressed primarily to the provision of an incentivo to continue in full-time educationthough it would also reduce the greater degree of financial sacrificeinvolved for poorer families whose children stay on.   However theinformation available for calculating the number of new participants atany given level of award is limited;   it is based on a 1977 survey of theattitudes of 3,000 fifth formers in England and Wales which was unrelated&quot;to family income.    On this basis three illustrative schemes havo beencosted (for Great Britain) at  167 million,  105 million and  33 million a year, les3 possible SB savings, and involving capital costs of some 117 million,  87 million and  24 million respectively.   The maximumawards for each of these schemes, payable for 52 weeks in the year,would be  9.50 (school) and  11.50 (FE);     7 (school) and  9 (FE); and 4 (school) and  6 (FE).   It is assumed that they would be disregarded for SBand family income supplement-purposes.   Tha estimated nuiubor cf now partisipantsunder each.is 67,000, 48,000 and 13,00J, representing 21 per cent, 20 per cent,and 8 per cent respectively of the total number who receive awards.Because the schemes would all bo means-tested, all the now participantswould be from the lower income groups.   Ihe figures throughoutrepresent the mid-points of very wide ranges, and relate to the timewhen the scheme would be fully operational, ie three years from itsinception.3
9*     A system of discretionary awards, building on tho present system outbolstered by persuasion of statutory action designed to secure a moreuniform approach by local authorities (on tho same lines as the Scottishscheme), in principle offers a more cost-effectivo way of achievingincreased participation (Option C).   On the other hand, the extent towhich local authorities would bo prepared to exercise the award-makingdiscretion is uncertain; and, to avoid criticism of the discretionaryelement, a relatively modest level of awards might in any case need to bopostulated.   A discretionary scheme could cost very much less than themandatory schemes in Option 33.   With a 90 per cent specific grant andstatutorily prescribed scales, however, the effects and costs might comeclose to those for the mandatory schemes.10. The introduction of mandatory awards or of a 90 per cent specific grant for discretionary awards for 16-18 year olds might make it difficult to avoiddoing the same for 1J+ students now on discretionary awards.    This wouldinvolve extra costs of up to  20 million.Conclusions11. The Group&apos;a main conclusions are set out below.     To deal first withrecent concern about tho relative attractions of full-time education in thepresent context of high youth unemployment and measures taken to rolicvo it -(1) A high rate of unemployment will itself tend to act as an incentive to stay on in full-time education.(2) It is questionable whether the MSC programme will have more than amarginal influence on decisions to leave full-time education; andthose who regard fUll-time education as a real choice are unlikely to be influenced in their decision to loavo it by the level of social security benefits for the unemployed.     But in both cases the level of payments,once received, rntsy act in somo moasurc as a disincentive to return to full-time education.If
Looking at tho problem in a widor and longer term context -(3) If the purpose of education support is to prevent hardship to young pooplc who stay on in full-time education or their families, itis arguable that tho most appropriate method nowadays is provided bythe system of social socurity and family support.     In logic thiswould point to abandoning the present system of education support;in practice Ministers might prefer to preserve those arrangementsunaltered.(4) On tho other hand, Ministers may sec tho chief purpose as being to increase tho number staying on in full-time education. this involves essontially political and social judgments. relevant considerations include the expectation that tho overall trend of increased staying on will continue (and, comparod with the early 1970s,increase);   and tho oxistenco of a correlation between staying on andthe socio-economic group of the father and, less marked, family income.(5) If Ministers docide that positive action should be taken to increaseparticipation in full-time education, they should consider theintroduction of a fully mandatory system of awards or of a discretionarysystem with statutorily proscribed scales of award.(6) &apos; A mandatory scheme would provide, for all those whoso families motits moans-testing requirements, a financial incentive to extend theirf\tll-time oducation and it would alleviate the greater degree of financialsacrifice which this involves for poorer families.     It would also, byattracting additional students, help to roduco youth unemployment. in cost-effectiveness terms such a scheme suffers, however, from the1 deadweight1 cost of paying awards to the largo number of thoso who wouldstay on anyway.    Tho cost would vary according to tho scale of awards(see paragraph 8 above).     In addition, it would probably bo necessaryto extend a mandatory scheme to 19+ studonts now on discretionary awards.5
(7) A discretionary scheme, with proscribed scales of award, could &quot;bomore cost-effective to the extent that local authorities wore selectivein making awards.     But there would always be some uncertainty whetherlocal authorities would apply their award-making powers with reasonableconsistency;   and to ensure the grant of awards on a scale which wouldsignificantly increase participation, a 90 per cent specific grant wouldprobably be necessary.     The cost wouxd then approach that of a mandatoryscheme.Possible linos of action(8) The legislation that would be required to give effect to (6) or (7)cculd not be introduced thi3 Session.     If therefore Ministers decide in favour of positive action, they have a choice between -i,   announcing in principle now a decision to legislate forcither (6) or (7) but leaving tho scales of award and othordotails to lie settled in the light of consultations with thelocal authorities and of this year&apos;s Public Expenditure Survey.ii.   entering without declared commitment into consultations withthe local authorities.     Such consultations might initially explorehow far local authorities would be prepared, without legislation andwith little or no now money, to grant awards more freely and ontho basis of a uniform, voluntarily adopted scale.6
