I circulated a revised text of the White Paper on Industrial Democracyto Cabinet colleagues last week (under cover of my Private Secretary&apos;s letteroi 11 May) and asked for drafting comments.    The revised version nowattached (Annex C) takes account of some of the comments received. for convenience these are also listed separately at Annex B.2. The other amendments proposed, which seemed to go beyond simplydrafting changes, are listed in Annex A.    I invite colleagues to consider the amendments in Annex A and, subject to decisions on them, to agree that the text of the White Paper circulated with this note should be published beforethe Whitsun Recess.S w department of Education and Science16 May 1978

Mr Shore suggestedother amendments later in the paragraph but they do not seemessential to me (see his Private Secretary&apos;s letter to mine,dated 15 May). araRraph T ?Mr Shore also points out that paragraph 12 leaves unansweredthe question of what happens if the proposals made by the IDC/ACAS on the composition of the JRC did not prove acceptable.As he recognises, this is a point of substance not drafting.*fae object of the proposals in this paragraph is that agreement0n a voluntary basis should be reached if the JHQ is to be ableto exercise any statutory rights.     The alternative of animposed solution does not seem practicable.     I recommendthat the paragraph be left unchanged.Paragraph 1?Mr Shore says that the heading poses a question which the paragraph does not answor.     The answer is that we are not proposing any specific sanctions.     It may be better to amend the heading so that it reads &quot;What would happen if companiesdo not comply with their statutory obligations.&quot; paragraph ??Kr Booth has suggested that the first sentence should be deleted^o the following inserted &quot;The approach in the Bullock majority report was that, while employee representation on the board shouldimplement existing collective bargaining arrangements, the role(confidential)
(confidential)of employee directors would significantly extend these by enablingemployees to participate directly in the management of the company and to share responsibility for its decisions.&quot;     The purpose of this amendment is to remove any suggestion that representation on theboard is different in nature from and superior to collective barg-training.     The TUC made much the same point about an earlier draft ofthis passage and it was amended as a result.     This suggestionis intended to meet the tuc&apos;s view rather more fully.     But ittends to weaken the contrast between the different views aboutthe role of employee representatives on boards which paragraphs21 and 22 are drawing.     i am inclined to make no change.Paragraph 26lir Shore suggests that the last sentence cannot be right and thatthe ballot is surely required to test workers&apos; opinions in a democratic way.     This last sentence has been amended before.It used to say that ballot was necessary because board represent-ation involves a major restructuring of the company.     The intention is to indicate that the major step of exercising the right to board representation should not be taken without testing allemployees1 view through a ballot.     It might accordingly bebetter to replace the last sentence on the following lines &quot;TheGovernment considers that a ballot is necessary because it believes that the views of all employees should be tested before such a major step is taken.&quot;ParagraphMr Booth would prefer there to be a reference to parity on the li^eSof the summing up to the Cabinet discussion on 4 Hay.     He would accordingly like the third and fourth sentence to be deleted andthe following inserted &quot;The Government does not exclude this an an objective but it believes that the development of industrial democracy should go ahead on a step by step basis.&quot;Paragraph 7-VMr Booth proposes that the second and third sentences should be deleted.     He considers that paragraphs 55 and 36 explain thenature of the dilemma mentioned in the first sentence of paragraph57i and the summary in the following two sentences is thereforesuperfluous.     Moreover, as they stand the second and third(confidential))
(confidential)sentences in his view unnecessarily present too stark acontrast between the approaches outlined in the earlier two paragraphs.     I am inclined to go along with this amendment.garap;raT)h s71 would prefer to omit in the first sentence the words &quot;thegreater and meaningful participation by employees in shapingBritish industry.&quot;     The TUC are not keen on references to participation and I think our earlier wording, &quot;the develop-nent of industrial democracy&quot; is more suitable.     The words in the second sentence, &quot;to plan the future of companies inWhich they work&quot; may be taken by the CBI as an indication that industrial democracy will be used to enforce planning agreementsthis may sour the 031 response.     I would prefer to say&quot;to share responsibility for the future prosperity of the com-Panies in which they work.&quot;     I think the emphasis on sharedresponsibility is the right note on which to conclude.(confidential)
2 MARSHAM STREETLONDON  SW1P 3EBMy rcfYour rcf15 May 1978INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY DRAFT WHITE PAPERYour letter of 11 May to Jeanette Darrell asked for urgent comments on a revised draft White Paper on Industrial Democracy.   From thisDepartment, we have the following comments:Para 1   It is not clear if &quot;industrial democracy&quot; as used at thebeginning of the fifth sentence is meant to contrast with &quot;participation&quot;at the beginning of the sixth, or whether the two labels are being used indiscriminately as synonyms.   Some further clarification seemsessential.   The description in the ninth sentence of our industrial relations as &quot;characterised by conflict&quot; is not happy.   The sentencefflight be better redrafted to read &quot;But there is still room to reducethe scope for conflict in our industrial relations.   Of course, someconflict is inevitable, even healthy: people in industry ...&quot;. Andin the next sentence, is &quot;lack of information&quot; merely a repetition of the preceding phrase &quot;poor communications&quot;, or does it meansomething?   The grammar of the next sentence seems to require thefinal phrase to read &quot;encourage them to use it&quot;.jjara ft   The final sentence should presumably read &quot;This White Papersets out the Government&apos;s legislative proposals ...&quot;J3F8 7   The opening phrase &quot;In this same spirit&quot; seems unnecessary,53 might be better ommitted.Para 11   The last two sentences might be less obscure if they read as follows &quot;They should also be a positive stimulus to the voluntarydevelopment of joint discussion of company strategy, for which they*ould be a natural focus.

The heading to the paragraph poses a question, which the paragraph itself does not answer.5j g 16   The second half of the sentence might be less clumsy andJore accurate if it read as follows &quot;Distinguishing carefully betweenwe information which employee representatives might pass on to theirconstituents nnd that which^hould not relay.&quot;

(confidential)DRAFT WHITE PAPER ON INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY1.    In a democratic society, democracy does not stop atthe factory gate or the office door.   We spend a large partof our lives at work and invest our skills and livelihoodin industry.   There is growing recognition that those of uswho do so should he able to participate in decisions whichcan vitally affect our working lives and our jobs. this development is no longer a question of &quot;if&quot; but &quot;when and how&quot;.   Industrial democracy in this White Paper stands forthe means by which employees at every level may have a realshare in the decisions within their Company or firm, andtherefore a share in the responsibility for making it a success.   The objective is      positive partnershipoetween management and workers, rather than defensiveco-existence.   Through their trade unions, employees play an increasingly active part in the affairs of theircompanies.   Legislation exists to protect people from unfairdismissal, bad conditions and exploitation.   But our industrial relations are still characterised by conflict.Some of the conflict is inevitable, even healthy. people in industry have different interests, and differ aboutohjectives and how they are to be achieved.   But part ofthe conflict is due to poor communications, lack ofinformation and lack of trust.   One way to change this isto create a framework for employees and their representa-tives to join in those corporate decisions that affect themand to encourage them to do so.   Where decisions aremutually agreed both sides of industry must then shareResponsibility for them.   Such shared responsibilitywiU improve the efficiency of British industry and opennp a range of new and creative ideas that can greatlybenefit this country.   This White Paper holds out theProspect of a major step forward in industrial democracyand we hope that both trade unions and employers seize&quot;hat should be an exciting opportunity.(confidential)
rapidly and has accelerated since 1968 when its importance was analysed in the Donovan report.   At national andindustry levels trade unions and employers work togetherwith government in the formulation of social and economic policies.   But at company level there remains a major gap in the development of the employee role.   Many of thedecisions which are taken by company boards have direct and sometimes major implications for the long term interestof employees.    The advantages of industrial democracy willnot be won unless employees in companies and nationalised industries alike have the opportunity to take part in thedevelopment of corporate strategy, to contribute to decisionsbefore they are taken and equally important to share inresponsibility for their implementation.   The GovernmentRelieves that these advantages are already recognised by^lightened management and within the trade union movement.5.     The potential benefits of industrial democracy can onlyoe achieved through co-operation between employers and employees.   Hence it is a fundamental principle of theGovernment&apos;s policy that as far as possible those concerned should be encouraged to work out the detailed arrangementsthemselves.   However where agreement proves impossibleemployees should be able   to claim certain basic statutoryrights.   Accordingly, the Government proposes that thereshould be legislation which would give statutory fall-hack rights to employees and unions.6-     In setting out its proposals for a statutory procedure,^e Government reiterates that it wishes - and would much prefer - to see employee participation proceed by voluntaryagreements between employers and the representatives oftkeir employees.   It is not the intention to impose a standard pattern of participation on industry by law.object of participation is understanding andThe-operation and it is obvious that the chances of successare i n,improved where employers and employees agree together11 the procedures for involvement which suit their wishes3.
and circumstances.   The Government expects that this willbe the basis on which most developments in participationwill take place in industry and that recourse to statutoryfallback arrangements will be the exception.7*    The Government intends to consultwidely on its proposals so as to achieve the greatest possible agreement on the measures finally introduced. we hope that all engaged in industry will discuss these proposals with the same objective.   As an aid to the consultativeprocess, the sections which follow discuss the main issues which arise on these proposals.DISCUSSION OF COMPANY STRATEGY8. The Government believes that it is possible to build uponand develop the best practice and arrangements which havebeen worked out jointly between companies and their tradeunions.   In many cases both in the private and public sectorsemployees are already involved in the determination ofcorporate strategy.   Many large private sector companies andpublic corporations have already devised procedures forinvolving employees in major policy decisions.9. In order to encourage the extension of these developments,we propose that the law should put employers in companiesemploying more than 500 people in the United Kingdom under an obligation to discuss with the representatives of employeesall major proposals affecting the employees of the businessbefore decisions are made.   These discussions would encompasssuch matters as investment plans, mergers, takeovers, expansionor contraction of establishments, and major organisationalchanges.   Further guidance on the subjects to be covered mightbe given in a Code of Practice akin to the existing Code on the disclosure of information for collective bargaining purposes.An Industrial Democracy Commission (IDC) if one is set up, orthe Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) (see
para 52) might be invited to draw it up with a view to its being submitted to Parliament for approval.10.   The Government expects that in the majority of companiesProcedures for this purpose will be set up by agreement. Thesystem should nonetheless be backed by the statutory provisionsset out below.   The disclosure of the relevant information would be a natural part of the discussion process, and would fall into place in that context.iiibo,should exercise these statutory rights?11 -   It would not be practicable for companies to discuss their corporate plans separately with each recognised trade^ion.   The issues are likely to affect all employees and itwould be in the interest of all that their organisedrepresentatives should discuss them collectively with thecompany.   The Bullock Committee in their discussion ofarrangements for employee representation on company boardsrecommended that the shop stewards and other lay representativesQf the various trade unions in the company should form acommittee, to which all the independent recognised trade unions in the company should be entitled to belong.   The purpose ofthis committee would be to negotiate with the company and todecide how employee representatives should be selected. they proposed that it should be known as the Joint Representationcommittee (JRC).   The Government believes that the formationQf JRCs would provide an important basis for inter-unionco-operation.   They should also be a positive stimulus to the voluntary development of joint discussion of company strategy,for which they would be a natural focus.   Either the board orJRC would be able to initiate the discussions.^-   To provide for cases where, contrary to the Government&apos;shoPes, procedures for joint discussion were not establishedvoluntarily the Government proposes that there should be a8tatutory fall back right to require the board to discuss5.
company strategy.   This right should be vested in a JRCbroadly representative of the independent recognised tradeunions in the company which in turn would be broadlyrepresentative of the employees as a whole.   Members of theJRC would be employees of the company.    If any trade unionconsidered that the composition of the JRC was inequitablethen it could appeal to the IDC/ACAS.    The IDC/ACAS coulddelay the operation of the obligation to discuss until it was satisfied with its composition and could make proposals but could not impose a solution.   There would be no stautory obligation on companies in respect of employees who were not members of unions but where it was agreed between the parties,nominees of non-union members could be admitted to thediscussion with the JRC.   This would be possible regardless of whether the discussions were on a voluntary or a statutoryfooting.    If no agreement were reached companies would be free to set up parallel arrangements for consultation with non-union members if they wished to do so.Should there bo sanction:; for companies which do not complywith their statutory obligations?13.   The Government believes that it will only be in a minority of cases that the statutory obligations will be invoked: caseswhere the obligations are invoked but not observed should be relatively few.   There are two possible ways of dealing with cases in which unions are dissatisfied because the companyfails to comply with its obligations.   One would be for the JR^to have the right to refer the matter to the IDC/ACAS for investigation.   After investigation the IDC/ACAS would draw upa report and, if appropriate, make recommendations.   The report would be published when the IDC/ACAS considered this to be appropriate.   The other would be for the JRC to have the rightto appeal to the Central Arbitration Committee (CAC) whichwould handle the matter following a procedure akin to thatoutlined in Section 19 of the Employment Protection Act 1975which concerns complaints about failure to disclose information for collective bargaining purposes.6.
(confidential)few should the confidentiality of information disclosed be reserved?Arrangements for safeguarding confidentiality ofinformation disclosed through these procedures is an importantissue and one upon which the Government intends to consultfurther with the CBI and the TUC before legislation is introduced.   The sensitivity of information on company strategyvaries greatly.   Some of the issues under consideration mayalready be public knowledge.   Others may not be generally known, but are not so material to the company&apos;s competitive position that they cannot be discussed among the employeesgenerally.   Yet other decisions, for example those concernedwith new product development and certain new investmentintentions will be such that their disclosure to competitors*ould cause substantial injury to the undertaking.15.   The risks should not be exaggerated.   Union representativesoften receive sensitive information in the context of theirlisting dealings with companies and it is the commonexperience that confidentiality is respected.   There is noreason why the representatives of the employees whose working^ives and welfare are bound up in the welfare of the company8nould be any more likely to betray confidentiality thanErectors of a company, provided that the nature andsignificance of the information is made clear when it is disc*   An appropriate course might be for companies to discuss^ agree with the unions the arrangements needed to preserve^e confidentiality of information to be disclosed, distinguishingCat,efullybetween the information employee representatives mightPass on to their constituents and that which they should not^elay.    if this is done it is unlikely that confidentialitywill**i in practice, present any serious difficulties.   It is ready possible for civil actions to be brought against thosemisuse confidential information to the detriment of theCo*Pany.7.(confidential)
while employee representation on boards should complementexisting collective bargaining arrangements, the role ofemployee directors would go beyond this and would enableemployees to participate directly in the management of thecompany and to share responsibility for its decisions.23. The Government believes that it would not be satisfactory to rely entirely on voluntary progress and it proposes that, where they wish it, employees should have a right torepresentation on the board of their company.   The Government&apos;policy, however, is to avoid inflexible legislation whichwould require the adoption of one approach rather than another.We discuss in paragraphs 24 - 36 below what form this legislation might take.24. As in the case of discussion of company strategy, muchcan be achieved by agreement without the intervention oflegislation.   It will be open to companies and their employees,as it is now, to negotiate whatever form of representation,procedures for the selection of those who are to representtheir colleagues, and whatever other arrangements seem to themappropriate to their wishes and circumstances.   Indeed it isto be expected that in the majority of companies board levelrepresentation will develop through arrangements negotiatedvoluntarily in this way.   To encourage such progress theGovernment intends to legislate so that a two tier boardstructure with separate policy and management boards is an option for any company.   Its study of this subject hasconvinced the Government that regardless of the question ofemployee representation, the two tier board structure can offer companies certain advantages over a unitary board. its proposals on this subject form a major part of its review of company law and are discussed in detail in the Appendix tothis White Paper.   Where employees are represented on theboard the Government believes the two tier structure will befound to be especially appropriate.   The policy board will play a major part in the formulation of company policy andthe taking of major decisions and employee representatives will10.
(confidential)he able to play their full part in this sitting alongside therepresentatives of shareholders.   It will also promoteParticipation arrangements throughout the company.   The policyhoard will not become involved in - or responsible for - theday-to-day running of the company   This will be the task ofthe professional management and this will be the functionattributed to the management board in the law.   The opportunityfor employees to share in day-to-day decision making will comeseparately through arrangements developed for participationhelow board level.25.   All directors on the top board, however   appointed, willshare the same legal duties and responsibilities.   As under thePresent law all directors will be required to act on their ownauthority and responsibility.   Company law prohibits themandating of a director to vote in a particular way. TheGovernment believes, as did the Bullock Committee, that thereshould be no departure from this principle and that thereshould be no question of employee or shareholder directorsbaing mandated to vote in accordance with the instructions ofthose by whom they are appointed.   Nevertheless it isessential that they should keep in touch with the opinion ofthose they represent.   Employee directors in particular shouldD* in close touch with the employees and the trade unions.*hiS will be important if they are to be able to reflect theviews of the workforce and to provide an effective channel ofcommunication to them.   It will be for those in each company*o devise arrangements which suit the particular circumstancesof the company and the information to be reported.2&amp;-   Where agreement cannot be reached, employees in companies^Ploying 2,000 or more in the United Kingdom should be ableif they wish to claim a statutory right to have representatives0n the board.   This right will be to representation on thePolicy board in the proposed two tier structure.   The employeedirectors should be employees of the company.   As in the caseof employees&apos; rights to discussions on future company strategy,11.(confidential)
exercise of the statutory right to board level representations should be initiated by a request from the JRC described inparagraph 12.    In the case of board level representation theJRC would have the right to require the company to organisea ballot of all the company1s employees to decide whetherthey wanted to be represented on the board.    If the result ofthe ballot was in favour the company would be able toreconstitute its board so as to adopt the two tier structure(if it had not already chosen to do so) and to admit employees to the top board.   Alternatively the company would have the option of offering representation on an existing unitary board.The Government believes that a ballot is necessary in the caseof board level representation since the consequences of theexercise of this right could involve fundamental changes inthe legal constitution of the company.27. The Government proposes that there should be a period of or 4- years from the date of establishment of the JRC before thestatutory right to board level representation comes intooperation.   This will allow for the necessary improvement ofparticipative machinery at all levels, in particular throughexercise of the statutory right to discuss company strategy.28. In its consideration and consultations on the detailed arrangements which should apply under the statutory provisions for board level representation the Government has encounteredtwo important issues on which views are divided.PROPORTION OF EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS29. The Bullock majority report is based on the principle of equal representation of shareholders and employees on theboard:    the composition of the board to be based on the&quot;2x * y&quot; formula with equal numbers of shareholders and employee representatives (2x) choosing a third section of theboard (y) by agreement between them.12.
50. This principle of equal representation derives from their view that the role of employee directors is to enable employees to share in the making of board decisions and to accept equalresponsibility for them.   Hence it is argued that employeedirectors cannot be expected to accept equal responsibilityunless, through equal representation on the board, they are tonave equal influence on the decision making process; thattheir credibility will be reduced in the eyes of theirconstituents if they can always be outvoted by the shareholderside,   it is argued too that in any case it is no longer accept-aole that in the last resort the shareholders&apos; view must prevail51. The main argument   used against equal representation isthat it would lead to deadlock.   Parity on the policy boardoan also be seen as upsetting the balance of collective^gaining which requires, for its effective functioning true^dependence of the two parties involved, trade unions andthe management board.   On this view if employees have an equals*v in the appointment and conduct of company boards this wouldresnlt in their having an unequal and greater force at the^Saining table, and this might affect the confidence ofinvestors making it more difficult to raise capital.1diffThe Government will continue to seek to resolve theseerences.    It recognises that there are strongly held views^Oog trade unionists in favour of parity as well as equallystrong views on the other side held by employers. The0vernment&apos;s view is that whatever the final objective may the development of industrial democracy should go aheadon a .^  a step by step basis.   The final objective itself may wellshaped by the experience gained in the practical working ofHew arrangements.    It considers that a reasonable firsteP would be to give employees the right to appoint up to^nircl of the members of the policy board in the proposed^a.er system.    After a period of experience there might beler statutory changes which would be subject to whatever13.
conditions seemed appropriate in the light of that experience.Companies would, of course, be free at any time to agree withtheir employees to make changes on a voluntary basis.Selection of employee representatives33. The majority of the Bullock Committee proposed that the JRCwould be responsible for devising a satisfactory system for theallocation of seats between the different employee interestgroups and choosing the method of selecting employee representa-tives.    The decision would rest solely with the JRC as to how this should best be done in the circumstances of the company.34. The complexity of the structure of British industry andtrade unions undoubtedly makes the problem of choosing a methodof selection for employee representatives very difficult.   To be effective on the board these representatives must have stronglinks with the shop floor and clear lines of communicationwith their constituencies - and they will also need to be ableto balance the interests of the different occupational groups in the company and of employees in different geographicallocations.    The Government agrees with the Bullock majority thatthe circumstances vary so greatly within British industry thatno legislation could be devised to cover them all.35-    Difficulties nevertheless remain.    It is argued that industrial democracy should provide for the involvement of allemployees and should not exclude some individuals or groupsfrom participating in the selection of those who are to representthem.    In particular it is said that to give unions the sole responsibility for organising this representation might be particularly damaging to the morale of certain groups of employees such as middle managers, whose commitment and loyalty to the company are no less important than those of any othergroup of employees and who in the main are not highly unionisedas a group.14.
^*   On the other hand, it is argued that board representations should not be designed in such a way as to undermine tradeUr*ions&apos; representative capacity.   Effective collectiverePresentation based on trade union machinery entailscollective organisation, and a structure for board level^presentation separate from trade union machinery wouldCr*eate tension and a potential for industrial disputes.Representation through this machinery would provide theexPertise and independent strength to enable employee representa-tives to play their full part in board decision making and provide an efficient and trusted channel of communication tothe shop floor and to their constituents.Thus there is a clear dilemma.    One view is that industrial democracy should mean that every employee has a right to beErectly involved in selecting representatives on the board.e other view is that any arrangements should be consistentWj-th the established system of collective representation ofei&amp;ployees in British industry.    One solution might be to build0tl the procedure proposed by the Bullock majority whereby the^0 would have the right to determine how the employee seats0ri the board should be filled, but if any trade union consideredthat the method or results of the system proposed was inequitablen could appeal to the IDC/ACAS.    The IDC/ACAS could delay thellaPlementation of the scheme until it was satisfied of itsa^ness, but could not impose a solution.38A further possibility would be for a similar right ofaPPeal to be extended to any substantial homogeneous groupemployees.    The statute could set out the criteria by^ch any appeal would be judged and these could cover the^graphical and occupational distribution of employees inn,ecompany;    and in the event of a successful appeal there0uld also be a requirement for elections based on nominationcandidates by trade unions and by groups of at least 100^Ployees whether or not they are members of trade unions.ere could be other criteria, if it was thought desirable.I
Groups and Multinationals39*   The Government believes that arrangements for employeeparticipation should apply at whatever level decisions are taken and in all companies incorporated in the UK where the number employed meets the stated thresholds, irrespective of thelocateof their parent companies.    In relation to board level represent^&apos;tion the Bullock Committee recommended that employees shouldhave a right to board level representation in the company inwhich they work, and, if that company is a member of a group,in the company which ultimately controls it.    The considerationshere differ from those relating to arrangements for the discussi0&apos;of company strategy.    A right to representation on the board atall levels in the group might well prove cumbersome, and in thelong term unnecessary if the presence of employee directors onthe top holding board leads to the development of representation at lower levels.   On the other hand representation at subsidiaryand top holding board level only could lead to a situation wheresome issues, which would otherwise be resolved at a lower levelin the group will be referred to the top holding company for decision.&apos;*0.   The Government has also studied the position of british companies which employ substantial numbers of people overseaseither directly or through subsidiary companies.    It recogniseSias did the Bullock Committee, the force of the conflictingarguments on the one hand that it would be unjust for representstives of a group&apos;s British employees to sit on a board which takes decisions affecting the unrepresented employees of a company&apos;s overseas subsidiaries and that on the other hand&quot;it would clearly be unjust to exclude some employees in theUnited Kingdom from representation at board level just becausethey work in a group which had employees overseas&quot;.    While thereis no easy answer, the Government could not accept any systemwhereby substantial numbers of employees in large firms in thiscountry would be deprived of the right to representation whichwill be extended to others.16.
^*   The Government believes that further consideration and discussion will be needed on both these issues. Whateverdecisions it finally takes will be consistent with theMaintenance of control over subsidiaries.    Any other courseWould not only depart from the practice in all other countriesbut would inevitably have considerable and adverse effects on future overseas investment in this country.POSSIBLE EXEMPTIONS FROM INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY LEGISLATION( 2.   it was suggested to the Bullock Committee that certain categories of companies or certain sectors of the economyOhould be exempted from the requirements of any legislationQa board representation.    The Committee left it to thosewho prepare legislation to consider in detail the case foraiVy such exemptions, but expressed the view that: &quot;GenerallysPeaking we are opposed to exemptions for particular groups0r classes of companies, or particular sectors of industrial0r commercial activity&quot;.    While the Government wishes to avoidexemptions since this would be to deny certain groups of employees rights otherwise extended generally throughoutlridustry and commerce, it is ready to examine the arguments111 the few cases where special consideration may be thought to aPply which might justify exemption from the requirements0f the legislation on board representation.   The case for anyexemptions must clearly be considered in the light of thedecisions to be taken on the various issues discussed in^is Paper.    But the Government does not consider it likely^at there would be any exemption from the right to discusseorapany strategy.Nation.nationalised INDUSTRIESIndustrial democracy is of special importance for the nationalised industries, and the Government intends that theyshould set an example to the private sector while recognising^e differences - in the nationalised industries there is the17.
public interest to be taken into account and there are no share-holders.    Most of the nationalised industries are unionised toa much greater degree than even the largest companies. certain of these industries have statutory obligations to promoteindustrial democracy.    Management and the unions in these industries are already making progress in developing new arrangements for participation.   The Post Office has begun an experinie^1lasting for two years, based on agreed proposals put forward bythe management and the unions for a new Board with, in additionto the Chairman, seven management and seven union members, anaindependent members including two with experience in consumeraffairs.   To enable this experiment to go ahead Parliament hasenacted legislation to increase the maximum number of board members from twelve to nineteen.   The Secretary of State for industry has made a formal offer to the Chairman of the TUCSteel Industry Committee of six trade union seats on areconstituted and expanded board for the British Steel CorporateBritish Aerospace and British Shipbuilders are required, underthe Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977, to promoteindustrial democracy.   Reports from both corporations have been laid before Parliament and discussions are continuing. Theproposed legislation for the reorganisation of the electricity supply industry, in England and Wales, set out in the White ^ ^:(Cmnd 7134) will include similar provisions requiring the pro^0of industrial democracy.    Discussions are under way in the otne&apos;nationalised industries.44.    In some of the nationalised industries the management and ^the unions have chosen to put the emphasis on the developmenttheir existing procedures.   For example in the energy sectorrecently established national Joint Co-ordinating Council in electricity industry and the Planning Liaison Committee of thBritish Gas Corporation discuss policies over a wide range Q^ ^ Jindustries&apos; activities.   Tripartite discussions of coal indusstrategy involving unions, management and Government began in1974.   They now include provision for the National Coal Board&apos;18.
after consultation with the mining unions, to submit to theecretary of State an agreed development plan as the vehiclefor a formal planning agreement to be renewed annually. TheSecretary of State for Energy has also established an EnergyCommission which will advise him on the development of energystrategy for the United Kingdom.    The Commission includesrepresentatives of unions and management in the energy1ndustries, as well as representatives of other interests.Other nationalised industries are similarly improving and developing their participative and consultative arrangements.^&quot;5-   In all this the Government is taking a close and positivelr*terest.    It intends to encourage further progress in developingand improving schemes of industrial democracy at all levels innationalised industries.    It has asked the Chairmen of^ke nationalised industries to consult with the unions ineach industry, where they are not already doing so, and to*alce joint proposals, by August 1978* for further improvements111 consultation and participation.   They might range fromeiQPloyee representation at Board and lower levels to further developments in consultative and participative procedures.is likely that any proposals which emerge can go aheadSickly under present legislation.   However, if in any^tionalised industries it is necessary to amend the statutes0 allow for an experiment, or for new arrangements, thekQvernment will introduce the necessary legislation, as it did for the Post Office experiment.&apos;   When legislation is introduced on industrial democracy^8 will give employees in the nationalised industries ar:iKht to representation on main boards.   This right will^ave to take account of the special responsibility of theT\ r* A i1onalised industries to Ministers, and through them to^liament.19.
EDUCATION AND TRAINING4-7.   The increase in employee participation envisaged in this white Paper will give rise to new training needs.    Until now,the functions of employee representatives have for the mostpart been concerned with collective bargaining on terms andconditions of employment, with general industrial relationsproblems, and with their duties as officials in their ownunions.    Direct involvement with overall company policies andstrategy, whether as board members, in the context of planningdiscussions, or in joint negotiation, will demand a wider knowle -on the part of employee representatives of subjects such asbusiness finance, management and forecasting techniques, and statistics.   They will also need a broad general knowledge ofthe business of the organisation for which they work. Manage?5and shareholder representatives will need to learn more aboutlabour matters and participation techniques.48.    It will be essential to ensure that these requirements are met.   Training concerned with the business of the organisation will probably most appropriately be undertaken within theorganisation itself but the more general education and traini11^of employee representatives will need to be provided elsewhere*Much of it will fall to be funded by Government.4-9.   The details of such education and training will need toconsidered - as to content, length, location etc - in consult with those most directly concerned, in particular the TUC. ^eamount of special training needed by particular representative^will vary according to the type and   level of participation 1/which they are involved.    Representatives on boards may needbetween 4 and 8 weeks (depending to some extent on whether oVnot courses are residential).    A variety of institutions and organisations will need to co-operate in devising and provid^^appropriate courses.   These might include public sector colle^with relevant experience in management and industrial relate0education, the TUC and independent trade union colleges.20.
50.   Whilst the major training needs will clearly be those of employees representatives, whether board or JBC members, someQf the training provided for them will also be helpful to membersof management and to non-executive directors.^*   The Government accepts the Bullock recommendations thatGovernment money will be needed for training employee representa-tives.    It will discuss with the TUC and others the best waythis should be done.INSTITUTIONSThe Bullock Committee recommended the establishment of an industrial Democracy Commission (IDC) to provide advice and conciliation, to give rulings on disputes, and to monitor andevaluate the operation of the legislation proposed in theirReport.Responsibility for advice and conciliation in industrialelations generally, and on collective bargaining and jointCoasultation in particular, currently resides with the^dependent Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service(ACAS), set up under the Employment Protection Act 1975-^here would clearly be a substantial overlap between the^actions of an IDC as envisaged by the Bullock Committee and^kose of ACAS.    Indeed, ACAS is already active in the developing^ield of employee participation below board level and ittogether with the Central Arbitration Committee would beCQmpetent to undertake the advisory and other functionsCoanected with the disclosure and discussion of companyegy.strat54&apos;   On the other hand the Bullock Committee concluded that**e duties envisaged for the IDC in relation to board^presentation involve an important difference in kind fromSe of ACAS in that the IDC would be concerned not only with21.
(confidential)industrial relations but also with company law and administrationThose functions could not, according to the Report, be satisfactofidischarged by ACAS, even if that body were to be reorganised and strengthened, since the aims and objectives of the Service arerelated entirely to industrial relations and its strength lies in the coherence of its various tasks.   To widen the ambit ofACAS to include the new fields of industrial democracy would,it was thought, not only fail to ensure that important taskswere carried out as well as possible but would also subject theService itself to damaging strains and pressures.55. The Government is disposed to accept the Bullock recommend^and to provide in legislation for the setting up of a newinstitution.    It will however explore the matter further withthe TUC, CBI, ACAS and other main interested parties.    In themeantime, to ensure the necessary institutional support duringthe initial phase the Government proposes to consult the Counci-^of ACAS about the Service expanding its existing role in theof employee participation - for example, the provision of volurlenquiry, advisory and conciliation services to employers andtrade unions on participation procedures, and the monitoringof developments on industrial democracy.Northern Ireland56. The proposals in this White Paper are for the United King^0as a whole,   The law governing industrial relations in Norther11Ireland is in general very similar to that in Great Britainthough there are some institutional differences which will need ^to be taken into account.    For example ACAS functions are car^1out by a separate statutory body, the Labour Relations Agency-CONCLUSIONS57*   The Government believes that its proposals will providepractical assistance and encouragement for the greater andmeaningful participation by employees in shaping British ind^$lThey will help to create a framework in which those among the22.(confidential)
workforce and in management who are most closely concerned withachieving real co-operation in industry can come together to plan the future of the companies in which they work. TheGovernment looks to those who work in industry to make industrial democracy succeed so that it may make the contribution that isaeuded to improve the efficiency of our industries and the prosperity of our country.
(confidential)APPENDIXC0MPAttY BOARD STRUCTUREWe are accustomed in this country to the unitary company^oard whose members are appointed by the shareholders and,having been appointed, are competent to take any decisiona Meeting the operation of the company, save for certain^portant matters which have to be referred to the generalbating of shareholders for decision.     In many european countries including Germany, Denmark, France, netherlands and Belgium, the two tier company board structure is usedeither as an option available to companies which wish it0r as a requirement for large companies.The German example is most often quoted.     The two tier^^Ucture has been a requirement in Germany for large companiesSlriCe the late nineteenth century and was originally intro-selected for reasons which had nothing to do with industrial^ftc-democracy but with the aim of giving the shareholders moreffective control over the way in which the company was run^  n they could exercise through the general meeting. In^foan law, large companies must have a supervisory board a Management board.     The management board is responsibleday to day management of the company and it alone hasCJ- to bind the company vis a vis third parties. The^Pervisorv board appoints and can dismiss for good reasonMembers of the management board.     It receives regular re-Pc^ts from the management board and has the power to requiree management board to refer certain categories of decision00 it -pxor prior approval.     The role of the supervisory board is fjooversee and supervise the way in which the company is^ &apos; out not to get involved in running it.     Members of theQ^ a^eraent board cannot be members of the supervisory boardvice versa.(confidential)
3 But this rigid division of functions between the two boards,which is attacked by the opponents of two tier boards in thiscountry as inconsistant with our flexible tradition of companylaw, is not the only model.     In Denmark for example the upperboard has considerable powers over the determination of policy andthe taking of major decisions, and within prescribed limits itis     impossible for individual directors to be members of both boards.4 Its study of this subject has convinced the Government thatthe two tier board structure can offer certain advantages over a unitary board whether or not the employees are represented atboard level.     It helps to clarify on the one hand the role of directors as managers and on the other their function of directingthe company.     Many United Kingdom companies already operate inpractice a two tier system in which the board of directors delegatesexecutive management functions to a committee or committees. TheGovernment believes that there would be advantage in formalisingthis arrangement by introducing a new legal structure for companiesconsisting of a main policy board and a management board.5 The powers and duties of each board would be specified in thelaw.     The policy board would control strategic decisions affect-ing the future of the company; it would appoint the managementboard which would be responsible in law for the day to day manage-ment of the company under the supervision and control of thepolicy board.     All matters within the competence of the policyboard would have to be referred to it by the management board for decision.In the case of the nationalised industries the arguments are different.     Each board is responsible to a Minister and so theappointment of a statutory two tier board would mean three formallayers of authority with some overlapping of responsibility.This is why the proposal for a statutory two tier structure is rejected in paragraphs 14-17 of the White Paper on the National-ised Industries, Cmnd 7131-     As is noted there the nationalised industries themselves do not want statutory two tier boards. Forthese reasons our proposal for two tier boards will apply only to companies.(confidential)
(confidential)The functions and responsibilities to be allocated tothe two boards are set out below:I FUNCTIONS OF THE POLICY board a   Appointment of the Management Board and fixing the remuneration of its members,h   Setting the company&apos;s objectives and approving itsstrategic plans (including major expansion andcontraction of the company&apos;s business).c   Monitoring the performance of the management board andapproving its decisions in certain areas to be spec-ified beforehand,d   Supervising the conduct by the management board of thecompany&apos;s financial affairs, in particular through theapproval of programmes for capital investment and forthe general allocation of resources to meet the comp-any&apos;s objectives.e   Determining the company&apos;s policy on takeovers of andmergers with other companies,f   Convening general meetings of shareholders: making recommendations to the shareholders on any matters where this is required and on other matters as appropriate.6   Setting overall guidelines for employment and personnelpolicies.II MANAGEMENT board the Management Board, appointed by the Policy Board, will normally consist of the executives of the company at themost senior level, sitting under the chairmanship of theChief Executive.     This is the body to which the law willassign the responsibility for the day-to-day management ofthe company.     The main functions and responsibilities ofthe Management Board will be defined in the legislation.This will distinguish it from the type of executive sub-committee which may at present be appointed by the Board,and which only has such powers  as may from time to time be delegated to it by the Board.     The Management Board will need to be given the powers necessary for the purpose offulfilling its management role, though still under the(confidential)
supervision of the policy board.      The main task to be given tothis board will be to manage the business of the company in thesame way as Table A of the Companies Act 1948 ascribes this tas^to the directors.     This will mean that in general the existingduties of directors under the Companies Act will apply in future to the management board except where they are specifically asin the new legislation to the policy board to enable it to perforC1the functions set out above.     In the broadest terms the manage&apos;ment board will be responsible for the running of the companysubject to the overall supervision and control of the policyboard.     Wore specifically, it will be responsible for acting for the company in relation to third parties.      It will have all the duties at present imposed upon directors in the law &quot;tokeep proper accounts and prepare the annual report and account3and will be required to submit them to the policy board. Itwill have special responsibility towards the policy board in anumber of areas to ensure that the latter was in a position tocarry out its functions and responsibilities.     In particular it will need to report regularly on prospective business polic^.pand other fundamental questions and on such other important w3as may be specified by the policy board.7 Members of the management board may also be appointed to ^policy board, but the majority of the shareholder directors 011policy board should not come from the management of the compasince the independent supervision of management will be anessential function of the policy board.A8 The Government has decided that the two tier system descabove should be introduced into UK company law.     However, eA ^,where employees claim their statutory right to board level T ^sentation, in which case except where agreement is reached tocontrary the representation will be on the policy board, the structure will be available as an option.     Companies wishing to retain their unitary board structure, or to incorporatewith a single board, will be able to do so.
