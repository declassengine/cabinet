UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 63 copy no 8019 June 1978cabinetPARLIAMENTARY AND MINISTERIAL pay memorandum by the Lord President of the council I. The pay of Members of Parliament and of Ministers and office-holdersir* the Commons may now, under the 12-month rule, be increased (the operative date being 13 June) whilst that of Ministers and office-holders in the lords may similarly be revised from 30 July.    This memorandum discussesthe issues involved and invites colleagues&apos; agreement *o the action i proposeto take in relation to a debate on these issues shortly.members&apos; pay2- Because of the voluntary waiver some Members signed in relation to^eir 1976  6 per week increase, Members&apos; salaries in practice currentlyrange from  5,958 por annum to the  6,270 specified in last year&apos;s^solution.    No doubt some Members will propose a variety of figures forthe increase to be paid in this round but i am convinced that the course that^ most consistent with our pay policy and which is the most easily presentedPublicly is to pay an increase of 10 per cent of the actual salary a Memberreceives.Pensionable pay3- Members&apos; pensionable pay currently stands at  8. 208 per annum whichcomprises the  8, 000 per annum recommended by the Top Salaries Review&amp;ody (TSRB) in 1975 together with the  4 per week increase paid last year.111 my view, there is no particular logic in having failed to incorporate thel976  6 per week in this figure and I propose that it should now be done.Moreover, recognising that pensions are a long-term affair, i see merit in maintaining pensionable pay at a level near to a &quot;correct&quot; rate for the job.&quot;Accordingly, i also propose that in addition, 10 per cent should be added to reflect this year&apos;s pay round.    This would result in pensionable pay rising to372 per annum.    Not only do i think this right but, in practice, i doubt if^e mood of the House would be met by anything far short of this.
LONGER TERM4.        I think it would be valuable to have at least one further reference to theTSRB on Parliamentary pay and allowances.    I would hope that they mightreport in sufficient time for their Report to influence next year&apos;s pay debate and, further, I would invite them to consider again the question of establishing,for future salary determination, a salary link between Members&apos; pay and thatof a public service grade.5- Motions relating to Members&apos; salaries have always been regarded asabstract, ie opinion-expressing Motions, with the result that Members havebeen able to move amendments to increase the amounts proposed.    But the ministerial Salaries and Members&apos; Pension Act 1965 (now replaced by theParliamentary and Other Pensions Act 1972) had the effect of deprivingMotions increasing Members&apos; salaries of their quality as abstract Motions,although this was not discovered until 1977 and in practice Members have continued to move amendments proposing increases.    Accordingly, I planthat the Parliamentary Pensions Bill now before the House should restore toback-benchers the opportunity of moving abstract Motions on their salarieswnich they technically lost under the 1965 Act.MINISTERS&apos; PAY6- Pay policy still precludes our taking action to implement the^commendations on Ministers&apos; pay contained in TSRB 8 but, in my view, an^crease of 10 per cent in both Ministerial and abated Parliamentary salaries(*3,208 Cabinet Ministers,    3,908 junior Minister and  4,220 Whips) wouldbe entirely appropriate.    I attach, for information, an annex showing currentra*es, TSRB 8 recommended rates, and the result of a 10 per cent increase.MEMBERS&apos; SECRETARIAT ALLOWANCE7- The secretarial allowance currently stands at  3,687.    This ises6entially a reimbursement allowance designed to recompense the Memberfo*- the cost of employing a secretary and to defray other office costs. I^ve received continued strong representations from Members that increasesln this allowance should be sufficient not only to allow them to increase their8ecretary&apos;s pay by the amount of the current guidelines but also to meetinereased employers&apos; national insurance contributions.    I see the force ofthis argument and I propose therefore that the allowance should be raised to*4.200 which should cover the increases in national insurance contributionsthat have arisen since TSRB 7 looked at this issue.InclusionQCabinet is invited to agree that:-
i. Parliamentary and Ministerial salaries should be increased by10 per cent.ii. Members&apos; pensionable pay should be increased to  9, 372 perannum.iii. There should be a further TSRB Review of Parliamentary pay and allowances.iv. Members&apos; secretarial allowance should be raised to  4,200 perannum.M privy Council Office19 June 19783
