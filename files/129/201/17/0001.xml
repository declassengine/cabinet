1978 PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEYMAIN REPORTThis report sets the scene for the decisions which Ministers will need to take on the 1978 public expenditure survey, namely (i) firm decisions on the level and composition of expenditurein 1979-80 as a basis for cash limits, Estimates and therate support grant, and(ii) a provisional view on the level and composition of expendi-ture in the three succeeding years.The plans incorporating these decisions will be published in thenext public expenditure White Paper.Existing policy . The Governments stated policy, in the White Paper of January1978 (Cmnd. 7049), is that the planned growth rate for total public expenditure should be within the prospective growth rate of national income, and that the aim should be a greater degree of stability in expenditure plans than has been achieved in recent years, so thatprogrammes can be managed with confidence that they will not be subjected to the disruption of sudden cuts. The White Paper statedthat on present prospects a growth rate for the economy as a wholeof as much as per cent should be possible provided inflation was contained and world trade recovered, but a growth rate higher than this could not be assumed in advance as a basis for planning public expenditure and even a 3J per cent rate could not be taken for granted unless inflation was controlled.3. Following Ministers&apos; decision to increase the plans for 1978-79by  1 billion in last year&apos;s survey prices, with consequent increases in succeeding years, the White Paper provided for the planningtotal of public expenditure* to grow by around 2 per cent a yearbetween 1977-78 and 1980-81. The highly provisional figures for1981-82 showed further growth of a little under 1 per cent for thatyear. The White Paper figures, revalued to 1978 survey prices, are summarised in table 1, lines 1-5.* See footnote 2 to table 1.

It is planned to discontinue this adjustment in next years survey, when the transition from childtax allowances to child benefit will be substantially completed.(2) This total, the focus of the White Paper, comprises programmes plus contingency reserve, including all net borrowing other than short term by the nationalised industries (not only their borrowing from the Government).(3) See paragraphs 9-11 and table 2.4. Ministers&apos; decisions since the White Paper, including the Marchemployment measures, increases in child benefit in November andnext April, and the decision not to put up the school meals chargein the autumn, have used up three-quarters of the contingency reserve for 1978-79. They have also added to some programmeplans for the later years, with the result that the contingency reservesfor those years have been drawn down by over  700* million in1979-80, around  500 million in 1980-81 and around  450 million in 1981-82 (see annex 15).* All figures in this report are at 1978 survey prices unless otherwise indicated.CONFIDENTIAL 3
5. The contingency reserve can be smaller as a year draws nearerand the plans for it firm up. The amount now left in the reserve for 1979-80 is around the level that will need to be published in thenext White Paper. But the amounts left for 1980-81 and 1981-82are less than those provided in the White Paper for years 3 and 4of last year&apos;s survey period, by about  200 million in each year.It is necessary to reconstitute adequate reserves for these years.Hence the survey baseline figures in table 1 incorporate contingencyreserves on a similar scale to those provided for the correspondingyears in January&apos;s White Paper.6. Other changes since publication of the White Paper have been mainly in the opposite direction. Some reductions were agreedduring preparation of the 1978-79 Estimates, and the figures forborrowing by the nationalised industries after 1978-79 have beenreduced substantially-by  250 million in 1979-80,  650 million in1980-81 and  450 million in 1981-82. These reductions, which account for a large part of the difference between the White Paperfigures and the present position, are subject to considerable uncer-tainties. They reflect recent discussions between departments andthe industries in preparation for the separate annual review of theindustries&apos; capital programmes and financing requirements: thefigures are subject to the decisions which Ministers will take onthat review.7. The baseline for the new survey is derived from the white paper figures but takes account of the above changes. The figures are set out in lines 6-10 of table 1.8. The forecast for debt interest has risen since the White Paperby  300 million in 1978-79 and 1979-80,  400 million in 1980-81and  600 million in 1981-82. Debt interest does not form part ofthe expenditure planning total and is therefore not included in the table. But it does affect the public sector borrowing requirement.Planning figures and actual spending9. If shortfall can be reduced over the survey period, actual expenditure will grow faster than the planning figures. This isexpected to happen in 1978-79. The Budget forecasts assumed some 2 billion of shortfall in volume terms (3-3J per cent) in 1978-79,compared with the  3J billion, or about 6 per cent, which occurredlast year (see annex 14). On this forecast, actual spending will rise by over 5 per cent in real terms this year well above the 2Jper cent increase in the White Paper planning figures (see table 2).

There are a number of reasons for expecting that shortfall willbe less this year than last year. Lending to the nationalised industries and housing subsidies are unlikely to show shortfall again on lastyear&apos;s scale, and the change in the arrangements with the clearing banks, which contributed to the reduction in export credit refinanc-ing, will not be repeated. The experience of the last two years has-emphasised the need to achieve a closer match between plans andoutturn; the attention which departments are giving to this experience (see the Part Two chapters) and greater stability in public expenditure planning should help to promote this. Pro-gramme requirements have also been re-assessed and some estimatingreductions identified in the White Paper provision for 1978-79.11. If shortfall could be further reduced, actual expenditure over the survey period would grow faster than the planning figures.For example, if shortfall were reduced to  1 billion by 1982-83, thatwould add an extra li per cent to the increase in expenditure between1978-79 and 1982-83, on top of whatever growth is agreed in the planning figures between those years. It would however be premature to assume this. Some shortfall is likely to continue. If shortfallremains constant at around the 1978-79 forecast level the growth of actual expenditure will be similar to that of the planning figures,which will thus give a good indication of the likely path of actualspending after 1978-79 (see further table 2).Scope for changes12.

13. If the especially provisional figure for 1981-82 were revised and provision made for expenditure to grow by 2 per cent in 1981-82and 1982-83, the resulting growth path would be as shown in table 3,line 1. The scope for considering additions to programmes within this growth path is shown in line 3.TABLE 3   million at 1978 survey prices		1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-831.

The proposals for additional expenditure which departments have tabled are much larger than the amounts available within theWhite Paper plans or the enhanced totals shown in table 3 for thelast two years of the survey period. Even allowing for reducedrequirements, proposals for additional expenditure in 1979-80exceed the &quot; headroom &apos; within the Cmnd. 7049 plans by approach-ing  1J billion. The problem in the later years is similar. Proposalsfor additional expenditure, less reduced requirements, exceed the&quot; headroom &quot;. within the growth path discussed above by around 2 billion in each year.m -^iTIoiite lateaig one (ntjjqsrb owl im^ onJ S32) donsndqxa15. The Part Two programme chapters give details of the proposalsfor additional expenditure, offsetting savings, reduced requirements and options for reductions on the basis approved by Cabinet. all of these are measured relative to the survey baseline. their inclusion in the report does not imply that they will be implemented:that is for Ministers to decide.16. Annexes 4-5 and 9-10 summarise this material. Table 4 shows the relevant totals.TABLE 4   million at 1978 survey prices1979-80  1980-81   1981-82 1982-831.

The prices which the public sector pays for goods and services,including pay, have tended over time to rise faster than pricesgenerally.   The real cost of the expenditure is thus not fully
measured by the survey figures in volume terms. Last year, how-ever, prices paid by the public sector rose less fast than pricesgenerally. It is expected that this relationship will persist this yearand next; but that thereafter a more normal relationship will begin to emerge. On these assumptions, the growth in the real cost ofexpenditure over the next four years is expected to be little different from the growth in volume terms. Annex 12 provides a fullerdiscussion.Local authority current expenditure18. The baseline figures for the total of local authority current expenditure in England and Wales show an increase of approaching2 per cent in 1978-79 followed by under 1 per cent a year from1979-80 onwards. While the departments with responsibilities for local authority services have mixed views about the practicability of restraining authorities to such a low rate of growth towards theend of the survey period, they are agreed that it would be unrealistic to plan for under 2 per cent in 1979-80. A similar minimum rate of growth is predicted in Scotland. These assessments imply increases in the baseline figures of  165 million in 1979-80 and of at least that amount annually in subsequent years (see supplementary analysis Ain Part Two). By way of illustration, if a growth rate of 2 per cent ayear were maintained after 1979-80, this would require further provision, in addition to that mentioned already, of around  135million in 1980-81,  305 million in 1981-82 and  570 million in1982-83.19. Within the totals, the distribution between individual servicesdepends largely on the guidance issued by departments, in accordancewith Government policies and priorities, but partly on the exerciseof local discretion by individual authorities. At times therefore theactual pattern of expenditure on local authority services maydiverge from that shown in the Governments public expenditureplans. There is some evidence to suggest that a slightly differentpattern is in fact now emerging and that the distribution shown inthe present baseline figures may need correction.20. If this is confirmed when local authorities submit revised estimates of their expenditure in the autumn, the present baselinefigures should be adjusted as necessary. But the question will arise in England and Wales whether these changes should be handledon a functional basis in the same way as other additional bidsaffecting baseline figures for individual programmes; or whetherthey should be dealt with separately as technical adjustments withinthe total of local authority current expenditure.CONFIDENTIAL 7
Public service manpower21. The survey baseline programmes are estimated to imply anincrease of about H per cent in total public service employmentover the period to 1981, followed by a small decrease between 1981and 1983. About half of this increase is in the health service and halfin local authorities: see annex 13. Public service employment as defined in annex 13 currently accounts for around 20 per cent oftotal employment.22. Civil service manpower is projected to remain at about 740,000throughout the survey period. After 1980 this repiesents a small increase on the estimates in last year&apos;s survey, reflecting the effects of higher unemployment assumptions on the staffing of the Depart-ments of Employment and Health and Social Security and of agreedincreases in prison staffing levels. Acceptance of all additionalbids would add between 3,000 and 4,500 staff to the forecasts foreach of the last 3 years.23. National health service manpower is projected to be about 2iper cent above present levels by 1981, but the baseline expenditure figures imply little further growth after that date.24. Local authority manpower is projected to rise by some 1J percent between now and 1981, reversing the recent downward trend.This increase is due mainly to housing, law, order and protectiveservices, other environmental services, and personal social services in England and Wales. After 1981 local authority manpower isprojected to fall back to below 1976 levels, as the reduction in staffin the education service is no longer offset by increases on other services.Regional expenditure and devolution25. The next White Paper will need to provide information aboutexpenditure on services for which responsibility will pass afterdevolution to the Scottish and Welsh assemblies. On present plans,the devolution referenda will precede publication of the White Paper,and vesting day for the Scottish assembly will occur during 1979-80.Public interest is likely to centre on the relative shares of England,Scotland and Wales in total expenditure on devolved services, and onthe ways in which this expenditure will be financed. Supplementaryanalysis D brings together baseline expenditure on devolved services.Analyses B and C show expenditure for which the Secretaries ofState for Scotland and Wales are responsible.
CONFIDENTIAL Main ReportCapital expenditure, including construction26. The share of capital expenditure in public expenditure as awhole is now much lower than in the 1960s and early 1970s. Thiswas mentioned in the March Cabinet discussion as deserving offurther study. The proportion is now of the order of 15 per cent.27. The main reason for the change is that the volume of construc-tion expenditure, which accounts for most of the public sectorsdirect capital expenditure, has declined in absolute terms, whileother elements in public expenditure, notably transfer payments,have risen. The survey baseline figures provide for public expendi-ture on construction to remain fairly constant over the survey period, at a level of around  7 billion a year (see supplementaryanalysis E in Part Two, which also discusses the prospects for private demand on the construction industry).28. Lower public spending on construction has resulted in part from the constraints on expenditure programmes in recent years(though the increases in construction expenditure announced lastyear broadly offset the 1976 cuts in 1978-79 programmes). But themain influence has been the changing requirements of individual programmes, including demographic changes. Less investment isnow needed in roads, water and power stations than in the late 1960sand early 1970s. With the fall in total pupil numbers, less newschool building is needed. In the housing programme, the era of absolute shortage is over, as pointed out in the recent Green Papers.In the national health service, the main priority in allocating theresources available over the last few years has been to maintainstandards of service, and this has checked development of the major hospital building programme which began in the 1960s.29. In some programmes there is scope at the margin for altering the mix of current and capital spending so as to smooth the courseof public spending on construction in the shorter term. The measures taken in the last two years to help the construction industry tookadvantage of this flexibility, although the allocations have so far been substantially underspent and have therefore contributed to shortfall.But expenditure designed to help the construction industry does notnecessarily reflect priorities in terms of programme objectives, andthe needs of individual programmes remain the dominant influence on the size of the public sector&apos;s capital expenditure.CONFIDENTIAL10714c* 2

ANNEX 12The relative price effectGeneralThe main figures in this survey report are at constant prices in volume terms. This presentation has considerable practical advant-ages because it enables discussion to focus on the content of the programmes, leaving aside the uncertainties about future rates of inflation.2. In reality, however, the prices of the various things which public expenditure buys change at different rates. Mainly becauseof the large labour content, they also tend over a period of years to rise faster than the average of prices in the economy as a whole.3. Volume figures do not therefore give a full measure of the growth in the real cost of public expenditure; and, in general, they tend tounderstate it. However, as explained in paragraph 7 below, thegrowth in the real cost between 1978-79 and 1982-83 is projectedto be little different from the growth in volume terms.Expenditure in &quot; cost terms &quot;4. To illustrate this &quot; relative price effect &quot; (RPE), a separate seriesof figures is prepared in &quot; cost terms &quot; (see the table on page 40).These are still at constant prices in that the effect of general inflationhas been removed, but they allow for the way in which prices ofdifferent types of expenditure have moved in the past and maymove in the future. The figures for the individual programmes thusreflect their changing relative costs. The charts which follow the table illustrate the movements in the relative prices of variouseconomic categories of expenditure (chart A), and the effects ofthese movements on some expenditure programmes (chart B).5. The relative price movements are measured relative to theaverage of domestic prices generally (the deflator for GDP at market prices). The figures of expenditure in &quot; cost terms &quot; can thus alsobe used to assess the relationship between public expenditure andGDP.6. Between 1973-74 and 1977-78 public expenditure increased from40i to 41 i per cent of GDP at market prices. Over this period,real GDP grew by R per cent, and the volume of public expenditure by 2 per cent, but the increase in &quot; cost terms &quot; (including the RPE)was 3J per cent. Thus even without any growth in the volume ofexpenditure, because of the relative price effect the share of GDPwould have fallen only slightly.
7. In volume terms the baseline expenditure shown in this reportgrows by 5J per cent between 1978-79 and 1982-83, and in &quot;costterms &quot; by 5J per cent. However the &quot; cost terms&quot; projectionsassume that there will be no large short-term fluctuation in public sector pay, such as was experienced in the last four years, or inland prices.Basis of &quot; cost terms &quot; figures8. The allowances for future relative price movements are basedon price assumptions consistent with those used in preparing thevolume figures for the forward years. The main assumptions are shown in the table below :1978-79   1979-80   1980-81   1981-82 1982-83Per cent increasesMarket price GDP deflator	8-5	8-0	60	6-0 60	Per cent increases relative to GDP deflator			Average earnings index	2-8	-0-5	I -4	1-4 1-4Retail price index	-1-4	-0-5	-0-5	-0-5 -0-5GDFCF.....	 	-0-5	-0-9	-O-Q -0-9Public  sector  pay  and other				employment costs .	-1-2	-0-8	1-4	1-4 1-49. The estimates of the RPE depend upon the movements in theprices associated with the various items of expenditure. They alsodepend upon the movements in the GDP deflator against whichthey are measured. This deflator is not affected directly by import prices, but it is affected by the introduction of the national insurancesurcharge and changes in indirect tax rates and in employers&apos;national insurance contribution rates.10. Earnings tend to rise faster than prices in general. Relative tothe GDP deflator, public sector pay increased sharply in 1974-75,but fell in the subsequent three years. In the last two years pay inthe public sector has risen less than pay in the private sector. It is assumed in these projections that from now on public and private sector pay rise steadily and at the same rate, so that this differentialis not eliminated. The assumption being made for pay in the forward years implies that the relative cost of employing staff will rise after 1979-80.11. The introduction of the national insurance surcharge in 1977-78affected employment costs but also increased the GDP deflator and hence had little effect on the RPE.   The changes in employers
national insurance contribution rates under the new pension arrange-ments will tend to reduce for a time the cost of employing staffin the public sector. This is expected to contribute about - 400million to the RPE in 1978-79 and later years, thus accounting for most of the apparent negative RPE.12. In 1973-74 procurement costs began to be affected by theworld increase in commodity costs; and in 1974-75 they were particularly affected by the increase in oil prices. As the GDPdeflator is not directly affected by import prices, this led to anincrease in the relative cost of procurement. The national insurancesurcharge indirectly increased the cost of procurement, and it isthought that the changes in the national insurance contribution rates will also give rise to a slight increase. Because the GDP deflator isalso affected, no significant effect on the RPE is expected. After1979-80, the price of procurement is assumed to rise in line withdomestic prices generally.13. The defence, education and health programmes in particularreflect these movements in the relative costs of employing staff andof procurement.14. In the case of land prices, the outstanding feature is the explosion in 1972 and 1973 and the subsequent collapse which gave rise to a large negative RPE in 1975-76. A relative increase in landprices is assumed in 1978-79 and 1979-80, but thereafter they areassumed to move roughly in line with domestic prices generally.15. Construction contract prices also rose sharply in 1972, butthere was a delay before this fed through into construction costs.After a peak in 1974-75 prices declined in relative terms, as con-tractors cut their profit margins in a depressed market. It is assumed that profit margins will remain at about their present level, and thatconstruction prices will fall relative to the GDP deflator.16. The environmental programmes in particular reflect these movements in the relative costs of land and construction.

ANNEX 13Public service manpower implied by survey baseline1. Table 1 summarises the detailed manpower estimates in tables2 to 5 for the civil service, the health service, the armed forces andlocal authorities. The figures are for the most part in terms of whole-time equivalents, and the projections are broadly consistent with the baseline expenditure estimates.2. The broad picture which emerges is of public service employ-ment increasing by about l1 per cent from present levels to 1981and then decreasing slightly to 1983. About half the expected increase is in the health service and half in local authorities. How-ever, due to the greater size of the local authorities, it amounts to21 per cent in the former case and only H per cent in the latter.3. It should be noted that the figures are not comprehensive, nor do they correspond precisely with the estimates of wages and salariesincorporated in the baseline expenditure figures, because they refer to 1 April and not to annual averages, and for other reasons; inparticular they exclude most public service employees in NorthernIreland.Civil service. The figures in table 2 were prepared by the Civil Service Depart-ment and show, to 1983, the forecast numbers of industrial and non-industrial civil servants provided for in the baseline. although there is no corresponding financial provision in the survey baseline,the numbers of staff in the trading funds and services, which form part of the civil service, are included in the table. Shortfall of the1 April 1978 staff in post figure against approved levels for that date is about 1 per cent, due mainly to high wastage and recruitmentdifficulties.National Health services. The figures in table 3 were prepared by the Department ofHealth and Social Security and by the Welsh Office and the scottish home and Health Department. In line with the conventions usedin &quot; Health and Personal Social Services Statistics 1976 &quot;, the figuresfor hospitals, community health services and other health services are in whole-time equivalent terms, whereas the figures for the family practitioner service are the numbers of general medical practitionersand dentists in the National Health Service.
6. The projections are estimates based on the assumption that theproportion of expenditure going on remuneration will remain broadlyconstant and that the effect of the management costs exercise inEngland will be a switch between staff groups rather than an overallreduction in staff numbers. In addition, for hospitals and community health services in England, the growth in whole time equivalentsover the period is expected to be less than the growth in wages and salaries, reflecting among other factors, a relatively higher increasein the number of medical staff.7. The figures for England and Wales exclude civil servants whosepay is allocated to the health programme including those working at, for example, special hospitals. The figures for other health services in Scotland include the common services agencies (which provide the ambulance, blood transfusion and some other services)and also staff at the State Hospital.Armed forces8. Table 4 gives figures for personnel in each branch of the Services.The figures for 1978 onwards come from the 1978 long-term costingforecast of tri-services manpower (February 1978) and are consistent with a level of expenditure above the baseline. Those for 1976 and1977 are actual numbers in post at 1 April in those years. Figuresfor locally engaged personnel represent men recruited outside theUnited Kingdom for full-time service including Gurkhas. The&quot; paid reserves &quot;, not included in the public service totals, comprisethe part-time members of the Paid Reserve Forces and the UlsterDefence Regiment.9. Figures for the civilian defence staff, excluding locally engagedstaff, are included in the table of civil service manpower.Local authorities10. The manpower figures in table 5 are in whole-time equivalentterms and take account of part-time employees who make up about one-third of total local authority employment in Great Britain ofabout three million. The figures shown include employees in localauthorities&apos; trading services, e.g. housing and passenger transport, aswell as those in rate fund services. The estimates for individual services are based on departments&apos; returns.11. The figures relate to the baseline figures in the survey report,and therefore do not take any account of additional bids for expendi-ture or reductions which might be achieved by the adoption of lowerexpenditure options.
12. The figures show local authority manpower rising by some 1 per cent between now and 1981, reversing the recent downwardtrend. The increase is due mainly to housing, law, order andprotective services, other environmental services and personal social services in England and Wales. After 1981 local authority manpoweris projected to fall back to below 1976 levels as the reduction in staff in the education service is no longer offset by increases on other services.13. Local authority staffing in England and Wales has been moni-tored since the middle of 1975 by the Government and local authority associations through the joint manpower watch group reporting tothe Consultative Council on Local Government Finance. A similarwatch on staff numbers in Scotland was instituted in consultationwith the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities in March 1976.These manpower watch figures up to December 1977 have been used as the base for the projections in the table in almost all cases.In the few cases where figures other than those of the joint manpowerwatch have been used, because more accurate information is avail-able, the differences are minimal or relate to staff who are excludedfrom the joint manpower watch, such as some 14,000 whole-timeequivalent part-time firemen and some 2,500 staff of inner-Londonpolytechnics.14. Public service manpower as defined in this annex accounts forsome 20 per cent of total employment. It includes familypractitioners and dentists which are counted in the private sectorin the statistics of employment published annually by the central statistical Office in &quot; National Income and Expenditure&quot; and&quot; Economic Trends.&quot; Employees of the nationalised industries andother public corporations are excluded, as are the staff of universities, which are private sector bodies.Public service manpower projections summaryAt 1 April (thousands)KITS^l health service- 7 forcesNorities!Total of above1976	1977	1978	1979	1980	1981	1982	1983748	746	736	739	741	741	738	740961	969	989	991	1,000	1,015	1,017	1,018337	330	322	323	324	324	324	3232,362	2,350	2,343	2,368	2,370	2,378	2,367	2,3484,408	4,395	4,391	4,421	4,436	4,458	4,446	4,429*ENTIAL 45

ANNEX 14Shortfall in 1976-77 and 1977-781. Table 1 compares the public expenditure outturn figures for1976-77 and the provisional outturn figures for 1977-78 with the levels planned in the public expenditure White Paper of January1977 (Cmnd. 6721). The differences indicate the level of shortfall in each of those years, subject to one qualification in each case.For 1976-77, at least  300 million of underspending had alreadybeen incorporated in Cmnd. 6721, so these figures are an under-statement. For 1977-78, there have been a substantial number ofannounced policy changes since Cmnd. 6721, which are distinguished from other changes in table 1. These have been met from the contingency reserve or, to a lesser extent, from reductions else wherein expenditure, and hence contribute little to the difference betweenthe planning and outturn totals.2. In 1976-77 shortfall was over 3 per cent of the Cmnd. 6721equivalent of the planning total (including all nationalised industryborrowing instead of government lending to them) in volume terms well above the level of the three previous years but of the same order as in 1972-73. Substantial shortfall occurred in the pro-grammes for trade, industry and employment; roads and transport;housing; and on the borrowing of the nationalised industries. Therewas, however, some underspending on every programme.3. In 1977-78 the shortfall in terms of the planning total was  3-7billion or about 6 per cent. In terms of total public expenditureexcluding debt interest returns from departments now indicate a shortfall  of just over  3  billion at 1978 survey prices. This compares with a figure of about  2  billion in 1976-77 and an estimate of 3J-4 billion at 1977 survey prices (say  3J-4i billion at 1978survey prices) made at the time of the Budget and published in theFinancial Statement and Budget Report. About  2  billion of this had already been identified when the last public expenditure white paper, Cmnd. 7049, was published.4. A great deal of the shortfall in the planning total for 1977-78was attributable to nationalised industry borrowing and other government net lending and similar transactions, including in particu-lar the refinance of fixed rate export and shipbuilding credit. Muchof the reduction of some  700 million in the last item was due todeliberate changes in the arrangements, under which the banks took alarger share. Excluding net lending and similar transactions the shortfall in expenditure on goods and services, grants and subsidies
in 1977-78 was no more than  1 -3 billion. This is less than 2\ percent of the planning figures: the corresponding figure in 1976-77 was per cent. A major contributor to this element of shortfall washousing subsidies. These were  300 million less than estimatedand this was almost entirely due to the unforeseen fall in interest rates. There was also substantial shortfall on employment measures and other items (besides export credit refinancing) in the trade andindustry programme, and on the roads programme. An estimatingreduction for social security largely reflected the fact that prices roserather more last year than assumed in Cmnd. 6721.5. The fact that inflation in 1976-77 was faster than assumed insetting the cash limits must have caused some of the volume shortfall in that year. But much of the shortfall in 1976-77 occurred in areasof expenditure outside or not directly controlled by cash limits.Cash limits probably allowed adequately for inflation in 1977-78; butcentral government cash limits were about 3 per cent underspentin cash terms. At least half the shortfall in that year, however, arose in lending to the nationalised industries and areas not covered bycash limits.6. Table 2 shows an analysis of shortfall in expenditure on pro-grammes other than lending to nationalised industries (the firstsection in table 1). The total column for 1977-78 excludes the contingency reserve. However announced policy changes correspondbroadly in total to the contingency reserve, and the column of other changes indicates the allocation of shortfall, taking the reserve intoaccount.7. As in the previous year most of the shortfall on programmes in1977-78 was in central government expenditure, with local authoritiesand those public corporations not given &quot; nationalised industrytreatment&quot; contributing last year only about one fifth of the totalbetween them. In the cases of both central government and localauthorities the shortfall in current expenditure on goods and serviceswas much larger than that in investment. More than half the shortfall on current grants and subsidies and on central governmentnet lending is attributable to the effect of interest rates on housing subsidies and to export and shipbuilding credit refinance respectively.

ANNEX 16Basis for preparation of 1978 survey reportIntroduction1. The purpose of the 1978 survey is to enable Ministers to decide the level of public expenditure programmes as a basis for control in 1979-80; and to review the programmes for later years, and extend them into 1982-83, for provisional planning purposes. the survey report prepared by officials is intended to provide the materialon which such decisions can be taken. The analysis of additionalproposals and options for reductions does not imply that ministers will necessarily adopt any or all of them, but is intended to enablethem to discuss a wider range of choices and priorities within public expenditure as a whole.The starting point2. The 1978 survey takes as its starting point the levels of expendi-ture programmes published in &quot;The Governments ExpenditurePlans: 1978-79 to 1981-82 &quot; (Cmnd. 7049).3. For the years 1978-79, 1979-80, 1980-81 and 1981-82, thefigures to be included in the survey baseline tables are those published in Cmnd. 7049, adjusted for:(i) revaluation to 1978 survey prices;(ii) any changes approved by Ministers up to 19 May 1978, andany offsetting savings agreed in connection with such changes;(iii) any reductions in the volume of expenditure agreed duringthe examination of 1978-79 Estimates;(iv) for 1979-80 and subsequent years, &quot; good housekeeping &quot;savings agreed with the CSD;(v) any approved classification changes.4. For 1982-83, the baseline figures should be equal to those for1981-82, except where it is agreed between the Treasury and thedepartment concerned that some lesser figure is appropriate. Anyrequirements going beyond the 1981-82 level should be identifiedfor Cabinet decision.
The survey report5. The survey report should provide the following information:(a) The Cmnd. 7049 figures, after revaluation and classificationchanges;(b) agreed changes since Cmnd. 7049;(c) the resulting baseline figures for the new survey;(d) proposed additions and reduced requirements (see para-graph 7 below);(e) options for reductions (see paragraph 8 below).The items at (d) and (e) apply only to 1979-80 and the three subse-quent years. Proposals for additional expenditure in 1978-79 shouldnot normally be made in the context of the survey: any such proposals will be dealt with as they arise through the year as partof the operational control of the contingency reserve.6. The chapter on each programme should set out the maincomponents of the baseline figures and describe the implications of keeping expenditure on the services concerned within these figures.Each of the items under 5(d) and (e) should also be briefly describedand tabulated. The description should include an indication of the spending authority concerned (i.e. central government department,local authorities, or public corporation). Any consequences for civil service or local authority manpower should be stated.7. In the case of items under 5(d) the report should describe thenature of the proposed changes (e.g. noting whether they arise fromchanged economic or demographic assumptions or for other reasons).It should also indicate whether the level of the expenditure concerned is governed by existing legislation or regulations or is within theGovernments administrative control. Any savings that could bemade to offset proposed additions to expenditure should be identified.8. As regards the options under 5(e) the report should illustrate the most feasible reductions in programmes in 1979-80 and later years, amounting to at least 2\ per cent each year. These options may include the offsetting savings mentioned in paragraph 7 providedthat the latter savings could be made on their own, without theaccompanying increases in expenditure. Programme texts should indicate whether main or subordinate legislation would be required and whether legislation in which the change could be included isalready planned. The responsible department and spending authority
should be stated, and the specific areas where the reductions would fall should be identified. As noted above, the inclusion of optionsin the report in no way implies that Ministers will adopt them, butit enables them to examine choices and priorities within the overalltotal.9. The nationalised industries will be the subject of a separateinterdepartmental report to Ministers on the investment programmes and financing for each industry, including appropriate options inrespect of individual industries. The financing figures for the nationalised industries as a whole will be summarised in the surveyreport. If the proposals for total net borrowing are higher thanthe figures in Cmnd. 7049, the reasons for this will be summarisedand options for offsetting reductions will be set out. Any changesin the net government lending figures which result from changes inthe assumptions on the pattern of net foreign currency borrowingwill be explained.10. In preparation for any changes which may result from thelegislation on devolution to Scotland and Wales, it is hoped toinclude a special analysis of expenditure which, under the proposed legislation, would be devolved to the Scottish and Welsh Assembliesand its financing, together with the corresponding expenditure inEngland.

In 1976-77 99 per cent of the money availablewithin the defence cash block was spent and the resulting small shortfall of 1 per cent was equivalentto  75 million at 1978 survey prices. In volumeterms the underspending against the Defence Budgetceiling given in Cmnd. 6721 was greater (3-3 percent or  238 million); the fact that price increasesduring the year were greater than was allowed forin the cash limit, mainly as a result of exchange rate changes, meant that the cash limit rather thanthe volume budget acted as the effective check on expenditure. Most of the volume shortfall occurred on equipment procurement, including lower pay-arrangements than had been expected on collaborativeprojects. Progress on works services was slower than planned, partly as a result of delayed decisions and changed requirements due to late budgetarychanges. The rate of billing by industry was alsoslower than expected, and this helped to containexpenditure within the cash limit2. Final outturn figures for 1977-78 will not beavailable until later in the year. Provisional figuresagain show a small shortfall of about 1 per centagainst the cash limit, equivalent to  76 million atsurvey prices. The volume underspend against theDefence Budget ceiling given in Cmnd. 6721(2 per cent or  140 million, a significant improve-Ncnt on the previous year) was again greater thanthe underspend against the cash limit. If occurredlargely on the equipment and works programme,partly due to uncertainties about future defence budget levels, and also to some delays in decision-taking, for example on provision for airborne early warning. The preliminary outturn figure given in cmnd. 7049 reflected a shortfall of about 1-3 percent ( 95 million).3. The planned Defence Budget for 1978-79 was reduced by  298 million, or 4 per cent, as part ofthe public expenditure savings on which theGovernment decided at the end of 1976. the resultant Defence Budget for 1978-79 is thus lower than for any previous year since 1950, and loweralso than those planned for the two following years.Funds will therefore be particularly tight in 1978-79.Preliminary monitoring results suggest that some slight underspending on the naval equipment pro-gramme, primarily because of delays in purchasingtorpedoes from the USA, is likely to be offset byhigher spending on the air programme. It is too early to judge whether an unusually high rate of spendin March 1978 is a pointer towards overspendingor underspending in 1978-79. The Ministry ofDefence are monitoring expenditure closely and ifsigns of underspending were to develop would drawon a reserve list of items which will make a valuable contribution to defence capability. Whilethe position may change in detail in the course ofthe year, there is no reason at this stage to expect any significant underspending.CONFIDENTIAL
Implications of survey figures4. For 1979-80 Ministers decided in the 1977 surveyon the Defence Budget shown in table 1 above. Thisreflects the agreement by NATO Ministers last yearto aim for 3 per cent annual real increases in defence spending over the period 1979-84 to avoidcontinued deterioration in the relative defencecapabilities of NATO and the Warsaw Pact.5. For 1980-81 Ministers also agreed in the 1977survey to a further increase in line with the NATOMinisterial guidance, subject to review in the presentsurvey in the light of economic circumstances. Themilitary and political reasons which led to thisdecision are still valid, and the Ministry of Defence,while not submitting any additional bid for 1980-81,believe that the baseline figure should be confirmed.Subject to the view taken by Ministers, of theeconomic prospects, Treasury officials are not proposing a reduction in the baseline figure.6. For 1981-82 no firm figure was set in the 1977survey; the 1980-81 figure was simply repeated,following the practice in earlier surveys. The base-line figure falls short of the projection of defence expenditure made at the time of the 1974 to 1975Defence Review by  290 million. The Ministry ofDefence believe that the baseline figure would be seriously insufficient to support the programmeendorsed by Ministers at the time of the defence review. Budgetary cuts made since that Reviewhave necessitated substantial deferments of expendi-ture, notably on equipment and works items.Resultant delays in the delivery of equipment willhave their effect on the age of equipment in servicethroughout the 1980s, to the direct detriment ofthe fighting capability of the forces. This lostground needs to be restored as far as possible.For 1978-79 new works expenditure in the UnitedKingddm will amount to about  180 million, whichis significantly lower than planned in the defence review. If the lower level of works spendingcontinues there will be disproportionate cfTects in the mid-1980s because priority will by then have to begiven to new operational works to support front-linesystems such as Tornado. This will result in theworsening of living and working conditions for theforces into the late 1980s. These cumulative delayshave already been criticised by the expenditure committee. In sum, if the level of front-linecapability decided upon by Ministers in the defence review is to be sustained in the 1980s a progressiverestoration of the position will be necessary,involving some increase in defence expenditure mthe early years of the decade.7.   Furthermore, various commitments both majorand minor, for which insufficient or no provision wasmade in 1975 in costing the critical level of capability&apos;are likely or liable to continue, while other assump-tions made in 1975 have been falsified in variouways.   On present planned force levels the peacekeeping commitment  in Northern  Ireland wicost  30 million a year in 1981-82 and 1982-83 overand above the provision in the Defence Review pr0&quot;objections of defence expenditure. The Defence Reviewdecision to withdraw from Cyprus has now been suspended; this will mean expenditure of as much as 48 million a year in 1981-82 and 1982-83 (thoughMinisters have decided that various suggestions fojreducing the size of the garrison should be cxammin detail).   Other commitments not originally P1&quot;0&quot;vided for, and for which no end is in sight, ind jythe keeping open of Gibraltar dockyard andreinforced garrison in Belize.

confidential. defence programme (see paragraph 13 below) would be ruled out. Moreover, endorsement of the baselinefigures would by definition represent a negativeresponse, at any rate as far as these two years were concerned, to the NATO Ministerial guidancecalling for increases in defence expenditure (seeparagraph 4 above).9. Adherence to the baseline would mean that a wide range of specific programme cuts would haveto be considered. For the Navy the programmes forship contruction, weapons and aircraft would haveto be reviewed. Possibilities for deferment includethe destroyer, frigate and mine countcrmeasiresvessel programmes and the purchase of new mines.Candidates for cancellation or deferment would include the proposed new class of conventionalsubmarine, purchases of anti-ship missiles and thepurchase of Lynx helicopters. Programmes outsidethe equipment field, notably works and general support, would have to be pruned notwithstandingtoe cuts which they have already sustained.Present and future operational capabilities would suffer, as would our ability to make a worthwhilecontribution to the NATO Long-Term defence programme. The industrial effects on the ship-building programme would mainly be felt in areas where unemployment is already high. For the Armya wide range of equipment projects would need tobe reconsidered; projects for low-level battlefieldair defence and for a new light anti-tank weaponwould come under particular scrutiny. The building up of operational ammunition stocks to the increasedlevels now judged to be necessary would be jeopardised. Cuts in training ammunition stocksa&quot;d in activity levels for operational training wouldtave to be considered. In particular, standards of readiness, training and equipment in BAOR would*N suffer further. Recovery from past cuts inProvision for works would have to be still furtherdeferred; the effect would be felt in living andforking conditions. A choice would have to be^de between lower expenditure on manpowerfwhich could ultimately affect the force levels&quot;Maintained in Germany in accordance with our^ty commitments and the expansion of the Ulsterdefence Regiment approved by Ministers last year)&amp;nd still heavier cuts in equipment and works, whichai worst could total as much as 20 per cent of^e content of those programmes other than main-^nce. The effect would be to degrade the Army&apos;present fighting capability (already judged by theExpenditure Committee to be inadequate), as wellas to undermine the force improvements recom-mended under the NATO Long-Term defence programme. For the Air Force any significantcuts would necessarily fall mainly on equipment,and major programmes would be at risk. Top-uppurchases of Harriers and Jaguars to sustain thefront-line, and planned improvements in thoseaircraft, would have to be reconsidered. Thedevelopment of a replacement aircraft for theHarrier and Jaguar, either as a United Kingdom or as a collaborative project, would be placed at risk,since a purchase from the USA would be easier to finance within the restricted Defence Budget.Any of these options would be industriallydamaging, and would entail a greater or lesserrundown of design and manufacturing capacity inthis field. Other projects to be placed at risk would include the purchase of Puma helicopters; the estab-lishmcnt of additional Rapier squadrons to the detriment of our air defences in the UnitedKingdom; development of a new anti-ship missile;deliveries of air-to-air missiles for the defence ofthe United Kingdom; and timely delivery of elcc-tronic counter-measure equipment for Jaguar andTornado aircraft. Any combination of these measures would reduce the RAF&apos;s operationalcapability and have damaging industrial effects;while several of the possibilities described wouldfrustrate an effective British contribution to NATO&apos;s Long-Term Defence Programme.10. Apart from the direct impact on the three services, cuts would probably be necessary in theMinistry of Defence&apos;s research and developmentcapability, in civilian numbers and in otherancillary programmes, with resultant damage to industry and employment.Additional bids11. The Ministry of Defence propose the following additional bids:  million1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 1982-83Defence Budget proposals 7,190-6 7,417-8 7,641-0 7,641 0*Increases compared withthe baseline in table 1       -        -      217-0 217-0** provisional.^NFIDENITAL5
These extra sums would be spent by the Ministryof Defence and the Property Services Agency who,together with the Department of the Environment,carry out all Defence Budget expenditure.12. The Defence Budget proposed for 1981-82shows a 3 per cent increase over the previous year,and is thus in line with the NATO Ministerialguidance described in paragraph 4 above. It falls 74 million short of the Defence Review projectionof expenditure in 1981-82, and furthermore con-tains no specific allowance for the increased costof commitments such as peacekeeping in NorthernIreland and our continued presence in Cyprus.The Defence Budget would therefore absorb theseextra commitments without compensation. Thefigure of  7,641 million is however judged by theMinistry of Defence to be just sufficient to main-tain the planned front line capability and allow the equipment programme to be sustained, allowing for the increased production commitment which willbe arising from projects such as Tornado. Itshould encourage confidence, investment and jobcreation among defence suppliers. It should allowcontinuation of the vital process of restoring thesupport base from its currently run-down level,and allow long delayed improvements to servicebarracks and other accommodation. It should enable some improvements to be made to the UnitedKingdom&apos;s home defences, which are the subject of current Ministerial discussion. The Treasury accept that a lower figure could not be achieved without some reduction in the currently planned front-linecapabilities.13. The proposed figure would also allow theMinistry of Defence to plan an effective contributionto the NATO Long-Tcrm Defence Programme. InMay 1977, on the initiative of President Carter, this programme was put in hand to adapt NATO forces to meet the changing defence needs of the 1980s.International Task Forces have made specific recom-mendations in areas where collective action isespecially necessary: readiness, reinforcement, re-serve mobilisation, maritime posture, air defence,communications, command and control, electronicwarfare, rationalisation, consumer logistics andtheatre nuclear forces. Many of the proposals arealready covered by the Ministry of Dcfcnce&apos;s forwardplans or could be accommodated within them. Theremaining proposals would involve either increased expenditure overall or a significant re-ordering ofdefence priorities. Detailed studies are required;these cannot be done quickly, and it will be sometime before the full implications can be assessed.14. The Ministry of Defence and Treasury officialswould be content to sec the 1981-82 figure repeatedfor 1982-83 in the public expenditure White Paper,supported by a comment that a firm figure will bedetermined in the light of developments in defence plans, including further consideration of the Long-Term Defence Programme.15. Nevertheless the Ministry of Defence wish tomake clear that a bid for continued Defence Budgetgrowth in 1982-83 may well be made in the nextsurvey. The case for this has been underlined bya recent NATO study of long-term trends in East-West relations which was undertaken in parallel withthe Long-Term Defence Programme. This studypredicted that Soviet policy will continue to layemphasis on military strength in the absence ofeconomic and technological parity with the UnitedSlates, and the lack of resolve to maintain themilitary balance on the part of Western Govern-ments would encourage the USSR to seek to dominate Europe through political or militarymeans. Forthcoming discussions on disarmamentshould make it clearer whether there is any genuinedisposition on the part of the Soviet Governmentto negotiate a lower level of armaments. Failingprogress in this direction, some continued upgradingof the United Kingdom&apos;s defence efforts may benecessary, with consequential implications for theDefence Budget.Options for reductions16. The 21 per cent option savings would requirereductions of the following amounts below the table 1 figures:  million1979-80	1980-31	1981-82	1982-83180	185	186	186Such reductions would fall on voted expenditure by the Ministry of Defence and the Property ServicesAgency.   No legislation would be required.17. For 1979-80 and 1980-81 the baseline figuresrepresent in the MOD view the minimum level ofexpenditure necessary to support the defence programme, even though they themselves involve
deferrnent of some expenditure planned in the^lence Review.  The announcement of the 3 perincreases for 1979-80 and (provisionally) for1980-81 was warmly welcomed by NATO; not toMaintain the increases would be highly damagingPolitically as well as indefensible in military terms.fte planned increases implied by the figures haveelPed to restore the momentum of the defence programme after four years of successive short-term^k; downward revision after only a year would damage the renewed confidence of British industry111 the stability and continuity of defence procure-^t plans, and would damage also present effortsdevelop international collaboration on defence for 1981-82 and 1982-83 the implications oference to the baseline have been described above,er reduction of 2\ per cent in those yearsadhA forthcouldournot be achieved without major reductions in&quot;Ur defence capability and commitments.  It wouldjJVolve finding annual savings of about  400-475&apos;on below the Defence Review levels.  For thisl^plete reappraisal of policy would be required..0 save sums of this size by 1982-83 would require5rv^&apos;ate act&apos;on&apos; Perhaps including withdrawal oftroops from BAOR (with implications for our^Jaty obligations, possible MBFR negotiations and.    current   Anglo-German   offset argreement),ediate withdrawal from Cyprus, disbandment ofed Army regiments, withdrawal from a completeAir Force role ie.g. specialised reconnaissance) andswitch of major aircraft purchases to the UnitedStates rather than collaborative European projectsinvolving a big role for British Aerospace. Majorcuts would have to be made in the shipbuilding programme; these could include the cancellation ofall future Cammell Laird destroyers, the defermentof orders for nuclear-powered fleet submarines andthe third anti-submarine warfare cruiser. Serviceand civilian redundancies and a rundown of Britishindustrial capability would be inevitable.19. Cuts below the baseline would therefore have a damaging effect on front-line capabili-ties, would be very badly received by our allies andwould adversely affect employment in United King-dom industry.Royal Ordnance Factories20. Henceforth programme 1.2 will show only theRoyal Ordnance Factories&apos; (ROFs) net borrowing from and repayments to the National Loans Fund.The baseline figures above show the value of netrepayments, estimated in cash terms, revalued to survey prices. It is expected that, over the survey period as a whole, the ROFs will be able to financeall necessary investment without any net borrowing from the National Loans Fund. The baselinerepresents fixed repayments and any 2\ per centoptions for reductions would result in only minimalchanges ( 0 -1 million or less).

Cmnd. 7049 made provision for the aid programme to rise steadily in real terms by 6 percent a year from 1978-79 until 1981-82. the survey figures maintain the 1981-82 level of expen-diture for 1982-83. They thus imply an increaseof 19 per cent in total over the survey period equalto     per cent a year.2. On this basis continuing progress may beexpected towards the United Nations target of1-7 per cent of GNP for official developmentassistance which the Government accepted inprinciple in 1974. No commitment was undertakenas to the date for reaching this target, and it hasbeen made clear that progress towards it must besubject both to the pace of the United Kingdom&apos;economic recovery and to the other calls on our resources. The United kingdom&apos;s performanceagainst this target was 0-38 per cent in 1972; itdeclined to 0-34 per cent in 1973 and returned to0-38 per cent in 1976 and 1977. The average per-formance of Development Assistance Committeecountries in 1976 was 0-33 per cent.3. During the survey period calls on the aid programme are likely to increase because of anumber of factors including providing short-termaid for developing countries with acute problems arising from changed economic circumstances, andthe need for us to play our part in any initiativeto provide aid for an independent Zimbabwe or for those central and southern African countries affect-ted by the political situation in that region. Onthe other hand, the growth built into the surveyfigures and the flexibility within the programme should prove adequate to cover these contingencies.The aid programme was underspent by some  40million in 1977-78 but the Ministry of overseas development is taking action to correct the causes of recent underspending and believes that under-spending on this scale is unlikely to continue.4. No new legislation would be required to change the level of expenditure on overseas aid, which is within the Government^ administrative control.But in order to plan and spend the aid programme to the best possible effect it is often necessary toenter into commitments at least two years ahead.This reduces the room for manoeuvre in 1978-79and 1979-80.New developments5. There is increasing pressure from the developing countries for more aid, for all donors to achieve the 0-7 per cent UN target and for a new8CONFIDENTIAL
accommodation between donors and recipients. TheUnited Kingdom will need to be able to play its full part in this process. It is not possible to fore-cast accurately the additional demands whichmight arise from the factors summarised in para-graph 3 but the Ministry of Overseas Developmentestimates that the additional funds required to meetdisbursements on new developments and makeacceptable progress towards the 0-7 per cent targetarc as follows:  million1979-30	1980-81	1981-82	1982-8336-6	46-7	75-2	158-7These figures would imply a growth in the aid programme over the survey period of 41-2 per cent. The Treasury take the view that the costs of these new developments can be met, and progress towards the 07 per cent target demon-demonstrated. within the survey totals, which show growth in the planned aid programme roughly 3 times as great as that for public expenditure as a whole.Options for reductions6. The effect of reductions of 21 per cent in1979-80 and later years would be savings asfollows:  million1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 1982-8319 0 20-1 21-3 22-6Reductions of this order would mean that theUnited Kingdom would make slower progress towards the 0-7 per cent UN target during the survey period and would mean a reduction in thegrowth rate envisaged in Cmnd. 7049. reductions of this order would be unlikely to lead to savings in administrative costs.Other overseas services. The four programmes dealt with in paragraphs to 21 below, either in whole or, in the case ofother external relations, in part, are the respon-sibility of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office(FCO). The policies underlying much of this expenditure are the subject of continuing Ministerialdiscussion in the context of the Review of overseas representation published in August 1977. Theyhave also been recently reviewed by the defence and External Affairs Sub-Committee whose reportMinisters will wish to take into account. At thisstage, therefore, illustrative options for reductions of 2\ per cent in 1979-80 and later years are shown on a strictly pro-rata basis.Overseas representationImplications of survey figures8. A comparison of estimates for 1976-77 and1977-78. as shown in Cmnd. 6721 and 7049 respec-tively. with out turns for those years (all expressed at 1978 survey prices) is as follows:  millionCmnd. 6721      1978 survey Cmnd. 7049     1978 surveyestimate outturn Difference estimate        provisional Difference1976-77 1976-77 1977-78 outturn1977-78Diplomatic Service .      .      . 149-7 144-6 5 1 J43-4 141-6Diplomatic estate   .      .      . 40-7 30-1 10-6 29-3 24-6Total      .      .      . 190-4 174-7 15-7 172-7 166-2y On the Diplomatic Service side for 1976-77. theTerence of  5 -1 million was due first to thelimit crisis caused in that year by the drasticAuction of the foreign exchange value of sterling,^cause of the pressures on the cash limit, planned(&apos;m identialactivity had to be cut back temporarily in some areas and not proceeded with at all in others.Secondly, because of late changes in Post Officecosting procedures, there was substantial under-spending on the provision for administration costs9
of issuing British Visitors&apos; Passports. The balanceof the difference was due largely to excess volumein the survey provision which was adjusted to amore realistic level during the course of 1977. the adjustments made were mainly in the provision forstaff both United Kingdom based and locallyengaged.10. The substantial underspending in the diplo-matic estate in 1976-77 and 1977-78 reflected the uncertainties of those years and previous years which, taken together, had a strongly inhibitingeffect on the buildings acquisition programme andassociated furnishing. The commencement of the cprs Review and, in December 1976. of themoratorium on new building, caused the postpone-mcnt of a number of projects for which provisionhad been made. The purchase programme, alreadyinhibited by the 10 per cent discount rate, also felloff to a marked degree.11. For the Diplomatic Service, the provision for1979-80 onwards is in line with the provisionaloutturn for 1977-78. This reflects the continuedefforts that have been made to bring provision,particularly in regard to manpower related cxpen-diture. into line with realistic requirements.12. In the case of the diplomatic estate, the annualprovision in the 1978 survey has been set to allow for a realistic level of activity in the building pro-gramme following the removal of the constraintsduring the period of the CPRS review and thebuilding moratorium. The new programme willhave to provide for a number of projects which havebeen held up as a consequence of the two con-straints, or of the period of uncertainty which preceded them. Another relevant factor is therecent change in project appraisal in the public services. This allows scope for increased purchasingoppoFtunities.Offsetting savings13. The survey figures take account of &quot;goodhousekeeping savings&quot; made in response to thePrime Ministers minute of 21 December 1977.Options for reductions14. On a pro rat a basis for the two main elementswithin this sub-programme, cuts in planned expen-diture of 2  per cent in 1979-80 and in later years would be:  million	1979	1980	1981	1982	-80	-81	-82	-83Diplomatic Service, etc.	3-2	3-2	3-2	3-2Diplomatic estate	0-9	10	10	1-0Total .	4-1	4-2	4-2	4-2Options of this magnitude would involve restrictions in the conduct of business with foreign governments and international organisations, as well as cuts inexport promotion services which would reduce thequality of service offered to exporting businessmen.Some post closures and staff redundancies wouldalso be entailed. Consular work and passportservices would also have to be curtailed if these services were to bear an equal burden of reductions.Where and how such reductions might best be madeis a matter for judgment. They would depend onthe decisions finally taken by Ministers on our overseas representation. Such cuts would also leadto a further slow-down in the purchase and building programme for the diplomatic estate.Overseas informationImplications of survey figures15.

Underspending in past years was due mainly toslippage in the FCO&apos;s relay stations capital pro-gramme, lower production of films by the COI,cutbacks by the COI and FCO on the sponsoredvisits programme and reductions by the british council to ensure that they kept within their cashlimits. In 1977-78, the British Council under-spending was increased by the collection of revenuein advance of related expenditure, the appreciation of sterling, and slippage in the capital programme.The figures for 1978-79 onwards have beenreduced, from the Cmnd. 7049 levels, in line withrealistic requirements.Options for reductions16.

This*as not set up, however, until late March 1978.and no funds were required in the year. In addition.CONFIDENTIALcertain provision for the costs of conferences etc.,on Rhodesia was not required.18. The forecasts for 1978-79 onwards representa realistic programme in the light of the outturn in previous years. Reductions for realism have beenoffset by the need to include provision for the UNMiddle East peacekeeping forces which have been
included on the understanding that the provision will be surrendered if and when the Force mandatesare allowed to lapse.Additional bids19. ODM have, in close consultation with CSDand Treasury and on the best assumptions that canbe made, reviewed their total commitments; netvolume increases arise for all years as follows:  million	1979	1980	1981	1982	-80	-81	-82	-83Baseline	39-7	39-7	39-7	39-7Amount now proposed	43-2	42-5	41-8	41-3Proposed increase .	3-5	2-8	21	1-6These increases relate to growth in the numberof supplements paid on attaining age 55 both to pensioners receiving pensions for public service with overseas governments and also to pensioners for whom the Government has undertaken to makedirect payments. In addition the average amountof supplements has been increasing as a result ofpensions coming into payment at a higher rate thanthat of old pensions which were ceasing. Pensionpayments are demand-related; savings cannot befound to offset this growth which stems from policy decisions taken some years ago.Options for reductions20. Cuts of 21 per cent in 1979-80 onwards would amount to:  million					1979	1980	1981	1982*	-80	-81	-82	-83Commonwealth War Graves				Commission	01	01	01	0-1	2-8	2-8	2-9	2-8Total	2-9	2-9	30	2-9Since international obligations rule out unilateralreductions in United Kingdom subscriptions to international organisations, savings of the aboveorder could entail, for example, drastically reducingor eliminating the grant to the CommonwealthInstitute and reducing or eliminating other smallgrants in aid.21. The Commonwealth War Graves Commissionreduced its staff by 37 (to 1,399) in 1977-78following reductions of 25 in 1976-77 and 250during earlier years as a result of reorganisationfrom the then total of 1,711. The provision of5-7 million in 1978-79 reflects a saving of over 0 1 million. A further saving of 2\ per cent or over  0 1 million in 1979-80 and subsequent yearscould only be achieved by an additional staffreduction of about 35 (to 1,364) which would seriously reduce the Commission^ power to carryout its duties.Military aidImplications of survey figures22. In 1976-77 there was shortfall of  0-3 million on Cmnd. 6721 provision of  1-8 million, and in1977-78 there was shortfall of  0-7 million onCmnd. 7049 provision of  3 0 million (all at 1978prices). Underspending in previous years was due mainly to countries being unable to take up trainingplaces offered to them: the degree to which thiswill happen cannot be assessed until towards theend of the financial year. In addition, in 1977-78funds allocated to the Belize Defence Force couldnot be fully spent owing to delays in procurement.Expenditure is level throughout the survey periodexcept for a small reduction from 1981-82 whenthe Belize Defence Force Project is to be completed.Contributions to the European Communities (net),and to the European Investment BankImplications of survey figures23. This comprises United Kingdom contributions to the European Communities&apos; budget (excludingamounts attributed to aid and other programmes),capital contributions to the European InvestmentBank, and receipts by the United Kingdom fromthe Communities&apos; budget. Following agreement atthe European Council in December 1977 on theintroduction of the European unit of account forthe Communities&apos; budget, conversions from the unUof account into sterling have been made at the rateof 1-55 units of account to the   (based on the rate at the beginning of March).12CONFIDENTIAL

The forecasts byCommunity areas have been calculated on theassumption that the United Kingdom share of thebudget in 1978 and 1979 is in accordance with ourinterpretation of Article  131  of the Treaty of accession.  However the United Kingdom will also have to pay its share of the gap resulting from theagreement reached at the European Council last december on member states&apos; contributions to the1978 and  1979 budgets; this clement is shownseparately in the following table.   The UnitedKingdom will also have to pay over full own resources initially, but will receive quarterly refundsof  the  difference  between  full  own resources and our actual contributions for 1978 and 1979 as this results from the European Council agreement.Full own resources payments commenced in the first quarter of 1978 and continue until the fourth quarterof 1979.   Quarterly refunds are assumed to com-mence in the second quarter of 1978 and continue until the first quarter of 1980.   Translating these payments and refunds into United Kingdom financial years results in a payment of  73 0 million in1977-78 (not covered by the table) and net refundsin 1978-79 and 1979-80 as indicated separately inthe following table.

Expenditure inNorthern Ireland on price guarantees for sheep and potatoes, on production and capital supportMeasures, and on support in special areas is includedln programme 15, Northern Ireland.* Most of the expenditure on agricultural supportir,d market regulation is determined in the context of the national and e.c. annual reviews ofagriculture.Out I urn in 1976-77 and 1977-783. Net shortfall on this programme was about1$ per cent in 1976-77 and about 5 per cent in1977-78. Some two thirds of the 1976-77 shortfallarose from Ministers&apos; decision to terminate theconsumer subsidy on butter earlier than planned.A similar proportion of the 1977-78 net shortfallis explained by lower expenditure on demand-determined schemes under the eec&apos;s common agricultural Policy; as these schemes are fullyConfidential15
financed from the e.c. budget, this part of the shortfall was largely offset by an increase in our net contribution to the e.c. (programme 2) resultingfrom the corresponding drop in receipts. e.c.-determined expenditure is particularly unpredictablefor the reasons given in paragraph 5.Additional   or   reduced   requirements   for themaintenance of existing policy. In general, the latest forecasts indicate that itwill not be possible to provide within the baselinefor the continuation of existing policies.Market   regulation   under   the   eec&apos;s common agricultural Policy (CAP)5. This expenditure is incurred by IBAP in implementing the CAP. and the baseline includes the estimated effects of the decisions on CAPsupport prices and related measures taken in May1978. The main components are intervention buy-ing, various production and storage subsidies, and payments on imports and exports (including  71 mil-lion for monetary compensatory amounts on sugarimports). Almost all of it is mandatory under EECregulations and most is funded from the e.c. budget.This programme covers IBAP&apos;s gross expenditure,the associated receipts from the e.c. being credited to programme 2 where they serve to reduce theUnited Kingdom&apos;s net contribution to the e.c..Expenditure is particularly unpredictable, as it depends, inter alia, on trade volumes, world com-commodity prices, exchange rates, and the day to dayoperation of the CAP instruments of marketmanagement. The provisional forecast of additional requirements in gross terms is:  million1979-30	1980-81	1981-82	1982-8341-4	40-7	40-7	36-other agricultural grants and subsidies6. The provision for price guarantees relates tonationally-determined price guarantees on products(sheep, wool and potatoes) not yet covered by or outside the scope of the CAP. The figure has been estimated on a conventional basis.167. The other principal grants and subsidies arcthose under the CAP for compensatory allowances in less-favoured areas, for farm and horticulturedevelopment, and to promote the production of beef and sheepmeat and encourage farmers to move outof milk production; and the national schemes forfarm and horticultural capital grants. The surveyfigures include the effects of the e.c. decisions takenin May 1978.8. These are all demand-determined servicesgoverned by existing legislation or regulations andthe latest estimates of expenditure by MAFF andDAFS indicate the following changes from the base-line figures:  million					7979	1980	19S1	19S2	-80	-81	-82	-83Production grants and sub-				subsidies ....	2-9	2-9	0-4	10Support for capital and other				improvements .	90	8-6	4-8	5-5Support   for   agriculture in				special areas	-0-6	0-3	0-7	01Total	11-3	11-8	5-9	6-of which: MAFF	2-8	3-9	-0-9	3-0DAFS .	7-7	7-2	5-9	2-9WOAD	0-8	0-7	0-9	0-79. The principal cause of the additional require-ments is the increasing level of investment under theEECs farm and horticulture development scheme,partly offset by a decline in the uptake of the nationalgrant scheme. Although negotiations are in progress on e.c. regimes for sheep and potatoes it is too early to say when the regimes will come intooperation or what would be their Exchequer cost.Other expenditure on agriculture and fisheries10.

Almost all expenditure by IBAP is directlydetermined by e.c. Regulations, and no cutsare feasible. The same is true of some agricul-tural expenditure by MAFF, DAFS and WOADand this limits the scope for reductions. further savings on staff and administration could not beachieved without abolishing functions.

Research17. The figures above assume no growth in cxpen-diture on agricultural research and development. Itcontinues to be Government policy to encourage thegrowth of agricultural productivity and the agri-cultural departments consider that this dependslargely on the previous flow of R &amp; D results.MAFF also consider that the removal of any growth in R &amp; D expenditure over the next five years would severely restrain the ability to commissionnew work to meet the industry&apos;s identified needs.Reductions in agricultural support18. It has not previously been the practice to alter support levels except in the light of the statutoryannual reviews of the economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry. If reduc-tions in support have to be considered, the leastdifficult area would seem to be the capital grants.The reductions would have to be applied both tothe national schemes and to the e.c. farm andhorticulture development scheme (FHDS). Other-wise some farmers and horticulturists would switchtheir investment plans from the national schemes to the FHDS and this might prevent the savingbeing achieved. Reduced FHDS rates would entail a corresponding reduction in the 25 per cent contri-bution from the e.c..19. A contribution to savings might also be made from the guidance premiums. These are payable to farmers whose development plans under theFHDS are concentrated on cattle and sheep for meatproduction and the rates are prescribed in an EECdirective. The United Kingdom has already pro-posed in Brussels that these rates should bemaxima. If this is accepted and the directiveamended accordingly, the rates paid in the UnitedKingdom could then be reduced. There would bea corresponding reduction in the 25 per cent EECcontribution.Conclusions on options20. If the reductions referred to at (b) in para-graph 16 were met wholly from capital grants, one way of achieving this would be to reduce mostrates of grant by about 2 or 3 percentage points.The agricultural departments point out, however,that the basic grant rates under the national schemehave never been lower than at present.  The higher18rates of grant for field drainage, and those intro-duccd as recently as 1976 for cattle buildings, grasssilos and certain other types of investment, are intended to give special encouragement where it willbe of most benefit to the expansion of economicproduction, e.g. by encouraging the better use andconservation of grass. The volume of capital invest-mcnt has fallen over the last three years, and thedepartments consider that reduced rates of grant would have further harmful effects on investment. Reductions in either the capital grants or the guidance premiums would necessitate the amendment of the appropriate statutory instruments, which requires Affirmative resolutions of Parliament. Either proposal would in additionhave to be referred to Brussels and the procedure for consultation would probably take some months.As noted above, a cut in the guidance premiums isalso conditional on a change in an e.c. directive.21. The agricultural departments consider that the implementation of these options would be regarded by farmers and growers as evidence that theGovernment no longer intended to maintain theconditions needed for a continuing growth in pro-productivity and efficiency and a moderate expansion in agricultural production.FOOD SUBSIDIES22. Provision is made for the e.c. butter subsidywhich it has been recently agreed should continue until end-March 1979. A small spillover allowance is necessary in 1979-80.FORESTRY23. This item covers the Forestry Commission^activities in promoting the interests of forestry, theestablishment and maintenance of adequate reserves of growing trees and the production and supply of timber. The activities divide between the ForestryEnterprise (a Government trading service) and the forestry Authority. The survey figures comprisemainly the current expenditure of the ForestryAuthority (including the grants it makes to theprivate sector), the capital expenditure of the forestry Enterprise (including depreciation, and interest at the target rate of return of 3 per centon the current value of capital employed) and sub-subsidies on activities which are not capable of producing the target rate but which are undertakenCONFIDENTIAL
for social reasons. The first quinquennial re-valuation of the plantations and fixed assets wascarried out at 1 April 1977 and the resultingincreases in depreciation, interest and planting sub-subsidies are reflected in the survey figures from1977-78 to the end of the period. It has beendecided that the survey figures should no longerinclude the subsidy to the Forestry Enterprise,representing the difference between its target rate of return of 3 per cent and a notional cost of capital employed measured by the ruling governmentlending rate.24. The shortfall on this	programme		was	slight.amounting to 0-5 per cent	in	1976-77	and	I percent in 1977-78.				Additional bids				25. Additional bids are set	out	in the table		belowwith supporting arguments for the proposals				in the subsequent paragraphs.							  million		1979	1980	1981	1982	-80	-81	-82	-83(i) Net increase in value of				stocks ....	 	 	 	0-2(ii) Road construction .	0-3	0-4	0-5	0-5uii) Buildings	0-3	0-3	0-3	0-3Ov) Forest management pro-				tection and fertilisation .	0-4	0-4	0-4	0-4(v) Vehicles, machinery and				equipment	 	 	 	0-4(vi) Land acquisition	 	0-6	0-6	0-6fai) Research	01	0-1	0-1	0-1Total	1-1	1-8	1-9	2-5Nothing can be offered by way of offsetting savings.0 Net increase in value of stocks26. This consists of additional interest at 3 per^nt on the continuing investment in plantationsand other assets in 1982-83 partly offset by anincrease in the transfer value of timber to be felled* that year.Road construction*7- In recent years the provision for road con-action proved to be inadequate and it has only^en possible to carry out roadwork essential for^westing by transferring funds from elsewhere in^e programme. The additional bid has been^termined in relation to the harvesting programme which increases from 21 million to 2-7 million cubic metres with income increasing from  26-7 million to  33-6 million over the survey period.(iii) Buildings28. Mainly for the maintenance and modernisation of housing for the labour force as both have sufferedin recent economy cuts, but also includes  0-million for essential repairs to an historic buildingused as a conservancy office.(iv) Forest management, protection and fertilisation29. These programmes have been held to a mini-mum during the period of economic stringency,accepting long-term losses in timber production for the sake of short term savings, and partly in thehope of recovering the lost ground when financial resources allowed.(v) Vehicles, machinery and equipment30. While the fleet of machines and vehiclesrequired for other activities remains fairly constant,the requirement of harvesting machines increases indirect relation to the increase in the harvesting pro-gramme. As a result of the strict application of theground rules in recent surveys, the annual pro-gramme for capital VME has levelled off; it isnecessary, therefore, to provide for an increase inthe annual requirement in order to carry out the increasing harvesting programme mentioned inparagraph 27.(vi) Land acquisition31. The planting programme in recent years hasbeen achieved only through the rundown of un-planted reserves of land. It is now necessary toraise the acquisition target to the same level as theplanting target.(vii) Research32. In recent economy measures the research anddevelopment budget has been cut by  0-1 million.As a result normal crop surveying has fallen behindand additional surveys are now required on wind-throw problems and a census of private woodlands.Research in a number of subjects is also necessary.Options for reductions33. As in previous exercises reductions requiredby the ground rules have been calculated on the cash expenditure element in the survey figures asCONFIDENTIAL 19

This option would reduce the planned pro-vision of new facilities for the public.Planting35. The existing funds in the survey are onlysufficient to maintain a combined annual newplanting and restocking programme of some19,000 hectares rather than the 22,000 hectares set in 1972 and endorsed by Ministers in 1973 and1974.  In order to achieve the reductions in expen-diture it would be necessary to reduce theprogramme of new planting by a further 1.Whectares in 1979-80 and 1980-81 and 2,000 hectaresin 1981-82 and 1982-83. This would mean a lossof some 30 industrial posts in 1979-80 rising to 60industrial posts in 1981-82, which could involveredundancy.Land acquisition36. The annual provision for the purchase of laD(*is already insufficient to sustain  the desirabeprogramme of new planting. Any cut would furtherreduce the amount of land that could be acquired-Commercial recreation37. The reduction of  0 1 million in 1981-82 aod1982-83 would reduce campsite construction vabout half.   These projects are now yieldingeconomic return, besides providing a popular source of recreation to the general public.Vehicles, machinery and equipment38.   Reductions of  0-6 million in 1979-80. ^million in 1980-81 and  0 1 million in 1981.would only be possible at the expense of &quot; ^replacement of vehicles and other equipmentslowing  down  investment  in  major ^arJC^.machines.   Such measures would increase theculties and costs of maintaining serviceabilityachievement of the rising harvesting programme-

The totalcost of the latter is now estimated at  19 million: 11 million of this is expected to fall after 1982-83.Underspend, which was more than 15 per cent in1976- 77. was reduced to less than 5 per cent in1977- 78.
Research and development contracts11. Cmnd. 7049 included provision for a significantexpansion (some 20 per cent) of expenditure on research and development contracts with industry;and for the maintenance of the current level of support ( 2-2 million per year) for the DesignCouncil. In 1976-77 and (provisionally) 1977-78there was a shortfall of expenditure on this pro-gramme in excess of 20 per cent, partly as a resultof the introduction of cash limits. In recognitionof this the department have accepted a reductionfor realism of  3 million (10 per cent) in 1978-79,and are introducing new procedures for the controlof research expenditure in future years.National  Research Development Corporation12. The National Research Development Corpora -tion (NRDC). whose programme of support forinnovation is running at about  7 million per year,is entirely self-financing and is expected to continueto be throughout the survey period. Provision hasbeen made for the premature repayment, from within the Corporation^ operating surplus, of 3 million (cash) worth of loans in each of the years1978-79 and 1979-80. This will discharge almost all of the NRDCs debt to the Government.Technological and industrial sponsorship13. The survey figures provide for a major increasein expenditure on industrial support and develop-ment contracts over the survey period: nearly100 per cent compared with (forecast) actual expenditure in 1977-78 when, as in 1976-77, therewas a shortfall of over 30 per cent against plannedexpenditure. The department have accepted areduction for realism of  1 million (9 per cent) in1978-79; the new procedures referred to in para-graph 11 above should reduce the tendency tounderspend in future years.Space14. The existing provision for both the national and international space programmes should be adequate to maintain existing policies. There wasno significant shortfall in either programme in1976-77 or 1977-78.Aircraft  and  aero-engine  general  research anddevelopment15. The 1978 survey baseline shows a shortfall of 2-7 million in 1976-77 over the Cmnd. 6721forecast and an excess of  1-0 million in 1977-78over the Cmnd. 7049 figures, all at 1978 survey prices. The  2-7 million shortfall in 1976-77 was caused by an underspend on the technology demon-strator programme. This arose from unavoidabledelays in obtaining proposals from Industry becauseof limited resources available there for such pro-grammes. In 1977-78 the creation of BritishAerospace entailed a withdrawal of direct Govcrn-mcnt funding from research work relevant to itscommercial activities. The savings were estimatedat  3-5 million (1976 prices) based upon a phasedwithdrawal of  21 million in 1977-78 and  1*4 million in 1978-79. The  10 million excess in1977-78 was attributable to the delayed vesting ofBritish Aerospace and the consequent resolution ofthe problems of HMG withdrawal of funds.Concorde16.   The 1978 survey baseline shows an excess of 6-9 million in 1976-77 over the Cmnd. 6721forecast and a shortfall of  1-1 million in 1977-78over the Cmnd. 7049 figures, all at 1978 survey prices.   The  6-9 million excess for 1976-77 was mainly attributable to an increase in airframedevelopment and production costs arising out of adecision to postpone the closure of the Fairfordflight test centre, an under-cstimate of payments toMOD (PE) for work on the Concorde programme in MOD research and development establishments,offset in part by a postponement of the implement-tation of the financial provision of the inter-companyagreements  between  BAC and  Aerospatiale inrespect of the  airframe and  Rolls-Royce andSNECMA on the engine. The  1 -1 million shortfall in 1977-78 was the result of slippage in the develop-mcnt and production programmes, together with areduction in major fatigue testing.RB21117. The 1978 survey baseline shows an excess in1976-77 of  6-3 million over the Cmnd. 6721forecast and a shortfall of  4-6 million over theCmnd. 7049 figures, all at 1978 survey prices. The 6-3 million excess for 1976-77 arose out ofadditional work on, and a slowing down of, thcdelivery programme from the RB 211-22 engineand a provision for payments, not made in 1975-76to Boeing for the cost of modifying Boeing 74?aircraft to take the RB 211-524 engine. The short-fall in 1977-78 is due to the earlier than forecast24confidential
completion of the 555 RB 211-22B engine pro-gramme: certain production receipts formerlyexpected in 1978-79 therefore occurred in 1977-78.18. The programme provides for government support to Rolls-Royce Ltd for the development and production of the RB 211-22B engine and forthe development of the RB 211-524B derivative, Atpresent there is no provision for other derivatives ofthe engine which are currently being considered byRolls-Royce. For 1978-79 Ministers have agreedthat in order to help to meet the expected negativecash flow of Rolls-Royce Ltd, additional launch aid for the RB 211-22B and -524B engines should bepaid to the company retrospectively and certainGovernment levies from the sales of engines shouldbe waived. This total additional assistance of  37million at 1978 survey prices ( 40 million cash) hasbeen offset by a corresponding reduction in theNEB survey provision for 1978-79.Other aircraft and aero-engine projects19. The 1978 survey baseline shows excesses of*M million and  2 0 million for 1976-77 and1977-78 respectively over the forecasts in Cmnd.6721 and Cmnd. 7049 respectively, at 1978 survey prices. The  11 million excess in 1976-77 reflects the decision to provide extra funding for the design*ork on the HS 146 aircraft and an under-estimateof payments to MOD (PE) for their technical super-vision of DO I sponsored projects. The excess of 2 0 million in 1977-78 is attributable to the continuing funding of design work on the HS 146ai*d a change in the method of calculating (from a percentage to a head count basis) the cost of MOD&quot;*E)&apos;s HQ staff employed on contractual work andProject monitoring on behalf of the DOI.20- The Department of Industry have submittedlhe following rephasing of the programme:  million1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 1982-83-0-1 -0-1 0-2GENERAL SUPPORT TO INDUSTRYNational Enterprise Board2l- Cmnd. 7049 provided for the maintenance ofGovernment support for the National Enterprise^NFIDENTIALBoard (not) at a constant  275 million cash per year (net of forecast loan repayments). The figures in table 4 express this at survey prices. In 1978-79they take account of the repayment of  275 million(cash) worth of short-term loans advanced to british leyland (BL) in 1977-78; and of the transfer of 40 million cash to the RB211 support programme(see paragraph 18), and of  75 million cash to theprogramme of selective assistance under Section 8of the Industry Act 1972 (to permit the advance bythat route of  150 million cash towards the  450million worth of equity purchased in BL under the recently agreed package). In 1977-78 net support for the not totalled  368 million cash, of which 325 million was for BL (the apparent overspendwas matched by underspend in the programme onselective assistance, following the decision to advance all the support required for BL in 1977-78via the not). The Government is committed inprinciple to a further  400 million (cash) worth of support for BL (beyond the  450 million advanced in 1978) over the period to 1981-82. Provision is included for two thirds of this ( 267 million) withinthe not&apos;s overall allocations for those years, andfor the remaining  133 million within the totals forassistance under Section 8.22. Under the Industry Act 1975 total outstandingborrowings and guarantees by the not (and itswholly owned subsidiaries) may not exceed  1000million cash. This ceiling is likely to be reached in1979-80: new legislation to raise the limit will berequired, and is envisaged, in the next parliamentary session.23. The not&apos;s net financing requirement is reducedby virtue of forecast loan repayments (in all yearsexcept 1979-80 when a lower level of repayment isnow expected) as follows:  million1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 1982-8310 -40 -0-5 -90It will be for further consideration whether, in the published White Paper, the provision for the NEBshould be expressed in survey prices or (as in previous years) in cash terms.25n
Selective assistance to individual industries, firms and undertakings24. The survey figures provide for expenditure onsupport for British Leyland (BL) by way of directivesto the not under section 3 of the Industry Act1975; on loans and grants (against losses incurred in 1977) to Chrysler UK Ltd; and schemes of selective assistance to encourage investment andproduct development by private industry.25. The department have the following additional(and reduced) requirements for the maintenance ofexisting policies:  million1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-8322-6	12-8	13-3	-40-8The additional resources in years up to 1981-82 arerequired to provide for the rephasing of expenditure under schemes of selective assistance (much of whichhas slipped from previous years, when there wassubstantial underspending as a result); and forincreased provision for BL ( 150 million cash in1978-79 and  75 million cash in 1979-80 comparedwith  60 million and  50 million respectively pro-vided for in Cmnd. 7049) towards the  1 billioncash programme of support (see paragraph 21above). With the completion of this programme,and the rundown of expenditure on existing schemesof selective assistance, requirements are reduced by 40 million in 1982-83.Refinancing and  interest support costs of homeshipbuilding lending26. This programme provides for the refinancingof part of the guaranteed fixed rate credit madeavailable to domestic buyers of United Kingdomships; and for the cost of supporting the subsidisedfixed -rate of interest. The figures for refinancinginclude provision for the additional costs of thescheme, announced by the Secretary of State for trade on 8 May. to allow certain shipping companies some easement of their loan repaymentobligations.27. Both refinancing and interest support forecasts are subject to considerable margins of error.Expenditure on refinancing in 1976-77 amounted to 71 million compared with  75 million forecast in cmnd. 6721: the difference was well within theusual margins of estimating error.   In 1977-7826net receipts on refinancing amounted to  92 million compared with  43 million forecast mCmnd. 7049. The difference was mainly the resultof a more rapid than expected increase in the banksnon-interest-bearing sterling sight deposits: maddition, there was a higher volume than usual opremature loan redemptions. In Cmnd. 6721 therewas no separate forecast for interest support costs.which were then included in total debt interest.Theoutturn for 1977-78 was almost exactly as forecast in Cmnd. 7049.28. The latest forecasts for refinancing showreduced and additional requirements in the survey period as follows:  mill&apos;001979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-83^9-3	-01	-17-2	7-8These are partly the result of forecasting correclions to the allowance made for the new refinaD^arrangements which have been negotiated withbanks (described in detail in the section on e3CP^lt/credits in paragraphs 94 to 98 below); and P3reflect revised assumptions about the proporfwhich home orders will bear to total orders ^United Kingdom ships, the average building P211and the average period of delay between Paorders and the commencement of construction.rt sho*&apos;29.

Expenditure on this programme m ^amounted to about  14 million compared ^ 37 million forecast in Cmnd. 6721. That1 ^stantial shortfall mainly reflected the fact t *^need for major subsidies for the industryrather later than expected: in addition. Prmade for redundancy payments to ship^^^workers was premature, as the necessary Wwas not enacted. In 1977-78 expenditure was ^ 32 million compared with  41 million *
Cmnd. 7049, the difference being largely accountedfor by another premature provision for redundancy payments and by the fact that a  3 million call on ahome shipbuilding loan guarantee, which had been expected to arise in 1977-78. was deferred to1978- 79.31. The bulk of the present provision is for two main items: the shipbuilding intervention fund andredundancy repayments to employees of BritishShipbuilders under the recently passed Shipbuilding(Redundancy Payments) Act. It is not easy in either case to forecast the precise pattern ofexpenditure between years. For the interventionfund, the provision is intended to cover theremaining disbursements flowing from subsidycommitments made up to the end of 1977-78 underthe first tranche of the fund; plus commitments of 75 million in 1978-79 under the second trancheof the fund, which is currently subject to negotiation with the e.c.. For the redundancy paymentsscheme, the provision is intended to cover thosebecoming eligible for payments in 1978-79 and1979- 80.Other support services32. Pending completion of a review, provision hasbeen excluded for expenditure beyond 1978-79 on educational activities in support of the developmentQf industrial manpower. Allowing also for therephasing of the United Kingdom&apos;s contributions towards the International Tin CounciPs buffer stock,the department have the following reducedrequirements:  million1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-83-0-2	-0-3	-0-5	-0-3^ture industrial support^3.

Thereare additional (and reduced) requirements for anumber of programmes which have access to thefuture industrial support programme: for selectiveassistance under Sections 7 and 8 of the industry act 1972; for the provision of land and buildings;and for other support services. When allowance ismade for these requirements (details as under eachprogramme above), the remaining unallocatedprovision for future industrial support is:  million1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-839-7	280	48-6	109-4Proposals for new developments34. The department have accepted a  8 millionreduction for realism in 1978-79. For later yearsthey have proposed the following additions (and reductions) to meet anticipated additional rcquire-ments on existing and planned programmes insupport of the industrial strategy:  million1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-8320-3	220	21-4	-9-4Central and miscellaneous services35.

The department have submitted additional bidsof  0-6 million in each year to provide for extrastaff  required  to  implement  the Governmentsindustrial strategy.SCOTTISH OFFICESummary37. The Scottish Office component of programmes4.1 and 4.3 comprises selective assistance to industryin the assisted areas; the Highlands and IslandsDevelopment Board; residual expenditure under thelocal Employment Act; the Scottish DevelopmentAgency; the Scottish Tourist Board; and the cost27
of the careers service in Scotland. There was short-fall against total provision of some 28 per cent in1977-78. Most of the underspend is attributable tothe Scottish Development Agcncy^s investmentfunction. The Agency is now pursuing a more active investment policy and underspending shouldnot recur.Additional bids38.

The shortfall of expenditure of some  1 million in 1977-78 was due to the operating deficit in 1976-77 being less than the Board had forecast,principally because of reduced power supplies tothe smelter as a result of the fire there in October1976, and the unexpectedly good performanceduring 1976-77 of Hunterston B nuclear power station.Implications of survey figures45.

Option cuts would yield  1-2 million in eachyear. Given the nature of the programmes, theywould have to fall largely on the WD A, DBRW andthe Wales Tourist Board&apos;s project assistance.REGIONAL SUPPORT AND REGENERATIONSpecial assistance for rural and highland areas51. There is an additional bid for the development board for Rural Wales for  1 -9 million in 1979-80and  2 1 million a year thereafter. Following the october construction package and transfers fromother Welsh Office programmes, the DBRWsprovision in 1978-79 is  7-5 million. The additional provision sought would enable this current level of activity to be maintained.Welsh Development Agency52. There is an additional bid of  11-2 million in1979-80 and  3-5 million in 1980-81 to finance a site preparation and factory building programme in Ebbw Vale and Cardiff announced on accountof the steel closures. Additional provision forthat purpose in 1978-79 was announced in theBudgetPromotion of tourism53. There is an additional bid of  0-2 million ayear for the Wales Tourist Board to extend tourismproject assistance under Section 4 of the Develop-mcnt of Tourism Act 1969.

The shortfall of expenditure,  1-6 million in1976-77 and  2-2 million in 1977-78, was due to
slower progress than expected on research anddevelopment contracts.Implications of survey figures55. The Department of Energy&apos;s non-nuclearresearch and development programme covers the fields of offshore oil and gas technology, research and development into coal technology, geologicalstudies, safety of offshore installations, energy con-servation and new energy sources.Additional bids56. It is expected that, to carry out sea trials onwave energy devices under the wave power programme, additional but as yet unquantified sumswill be required.Options for reductions57. In order to make the reduction required onthe Department of Energy&apos;s non-nuclear expenditure as a whole, the following contribution would berequired of R and D expenditure:  millionI979S0	1980-81	1981-82	1982-830-2	-	0-8	-This would place a constraint on important and expanding areas of work, and would weaken thedepartments R and D effort at exactly the timewhen the emphasis is on further expansion.GENERAL SUPPORT FOR INDUSTRYSelective assistance to individual industries, firms andundertakingsComparison of outturn figures58. The shortfall of expenditure,  3-3 million in1976-77 and  7-9 million in 1977-78, was due tofewer claims being received than expected on theoffshore supplies interest relief grant scheme.Implications of survey figures59. The Department of Energy&apos;s offshore suppliesinterest relief grant scheme, which forms the major part of this provision, will continue. Increases inthe figures which would otherwise be necessary because of increases in the estimates of platformetc. costs in real terms are offset by the proposedrestrictions of the scheme from 1979 onwards tomeet the e.c. Commission^ concern about itscompatibility with the Treaty of Rome. Provisionfor assistance under Section 8 of the Industry Act1972 is limited to approved projects. any additional projects would result in a claim on the contingency reserve.Additional bids60. The possibility of a gas gathering pipeline fromthe Northern Basin of the North Sea has been understudy. The future of such a project is uncertainand no estimate can be made of any possible claim on the contingency reserve were it to go ahead.Options for reductions61.

The increase in expenditure for 1977-78 of 6-8 million was due to the Huntcrston guaranteebeing paid earlier than expected. The departmentscontribution to the offshore protection force and themissile safety system on the Cardigan Bay rangewill be met and the regional energy saving advisory service will continue to operate. There is little scope for reductions in this area since individual items ofexpenditure are both committed and small.SUPPORT FOR THE NATIONALISED INDUS-TRIES (OTHER THAN THE transport industries)Assistance to the coal industryImplications of survey figures63.  The shortfall of expenditure of  5-1 million in1976-77 was due to fewer redundancies than expectation-ted; the shortfall in expenditure in 1977-78 of  1-1 million was due to higher receipts in respect of30CONFIDENTIAL

This expenditure takes for the most part theform of grants paid under the powers vested in theSecretary of State by the Coal Industry Act 1977^d, since both the decision to use the powers andtoe levels at which support will be offered are theobject of Government commitments there is not inPractice, any scope for reductions.Other compensation^- The shortfall of expenditure of  1 -4 million in1977-78 was due to a rephasing of expenditure intokter years. The Department of Energy will meetll* commitment to compensate the CEGB for the^t of accelerating the construction of the Ince &apos;B&apos;and Drax 4B&apos; power stations. There is no scope for further reductions, since payments are statutorilyfoverned.CENTRAL AND MISCELLANEOUS SERVICESImplications of survey figures67. The shortfall of expenditure,  4-9 million in1976-77 and  2-9 million in 1977-78. was mainly due to fewer claims being received than expectedfor the electricity discount scheme (1976-77) andmore receipts than expected in respect of oil storage(1977-78). The Department of Energy can continueto carry out its functions which include maintaining and operating the Government owned oil storage and pipeline system and its share of the energy conser-vation measures announced on 12 December 1977.The oil storage and pipeline system, which ismanaged on an agency basis by the BNOC, ismaintained primarily for defence purposes. Govern-ment owned stocks of oil may be used if necessaryin emergencies. In order to meet the costs someof the facilities arc hired out on a commercial basis,others on a cost recovery basis. However, thecurrent annual cost of maintaining and operating thesystem exceeds receipts by some  4 million and the deficit is met by the sale of Government ownedstocks of oil. BNOC are reviewing the commercialviability of the system but the costs of maintainingGovernment owned oil stocks, which account for about half of the annual deficit, will remain a charge on public funds.Additional bids68. No provision has been made for giving assis-tance to domestic energy consumers in the winter1978-79. The cost of any such assistance wouldbe decided under the contingency reserve operational control procedures; the cost in 1978-79 would be 25 million or more depending on the nature ofthe scheme.Options for reductions69.

The underspend of  6-2 million in 1976-77was primarily due to a reduction in the contractsplaced with the Nuclear Power Company. the apparent overspend in 1977-78 of  4-9 million was partly due to a decrease in ore receipts and partly due to the late agreement reached to purchaseplutonium after the Atomic Energy Authority(sea)&apos;s programme had been reduced on grounds of realism in the light of the then expected outturn.Although the 1977-78 outturn is in excess of the reduced figure published in Cmnd. 7049, it is wellinside the original provision in Cmnd. 6721.Implications of survey figures71. The figures are derived from the 1974 survey.They have been adjusted to take account of recentdecisions on the Joint European Torus (JET) andon thermal reactor policy but do not, however,reflect the changes in policies and priorities whichhave taken place in the field of nuclear power inrecent years e.g. with regard to environmental issues.Policy on the fast reactor is currently under review.So too are the sea&apos;s non-JET fusion work, thefuture of the Winfrith prototype SGHWR and the programmes on environmental aspects of nuclear power following the Governments response to the sixth Report of the Royal Commission on Environ-mental Pollution. Whilst there is substantial existing provision for the programmes under review some ofthem are likely to call for significant additional expenditure, particularly from 1979-80 onwards.Additional bids72. The sea have put forward proposals for thefurther development of the fast reactor which would at the maximum involve the following increases in expenditure.  Ministerial decisions will be needed.  million7979 1980    1981 1982-80 -81      -82 -83PFR operation (including re-placement tube bundles) 14-2 13-1    10-8 5-9Demonstration of closed fuelcycle at Dounreay 4-9 7-1     9-2 12-1CRF design and developmentbyNPC   ....   -2-2 2-4     5-6 8-4Total16-9    22-6    25-6 26-4The sea also propose to bring forward Pr0*grammes on the safe disposal of radioactive wasteand the temporary or permanent storage of irradiated fuel and radioactive waste, given the greaterpriority now attached to these areas and the changein public attitudes towards them.

74. The White Paper figures are the minimum necessary to implement Ministers&apos; recent decisions onthermal reactor policy and JET and to maintain our existing effort on the fast reactor and other programmes. Any reduction would seriously weaken the Authority&apos;s capability in one or more of these areas.DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT75. Over the Department of Employment Group&apos;programme as a whole (Functioning of the labour market. Health and Safety at Work and part of central and Miscellaneous Services) the baselinefigures reflect the savings shown below in central and local government expenditure arising from a review of current policies and certain estimatingchanges.  million1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-8312-7	2-0	6-8	10-7The only large reduced requirement is the newestimates of expenditure from the Redundancy and maternity Pay Funds ( 18-20 million a year). Thisis not reflected in the baseline.76. In 1977-78 underspending amounted to about15 per cent on the Manpower Services Commissions(MSC) grant-in-aid, to about 7 per cent on the restof the DE Group&apos;s cash limited expenditure andahout 15 per cent on expenditure excluded fromcash limits. For the MSC, expenditure was lower than expected on training activities, rents andPremises costs. For the rest of the group there weresavings on salaries generally and slippage in capitalc*penditure by the Health and Safety Commission&apos;HSQ from the cash limited provision. A sub-stantially lower take-up than expected for the jobPlease and temporary employment subsidy schemes*as the main cause of shortfall in the expendituredeluded from cash limits. These shortfalls have^en taken into account in preparing the currentforecasts but some difficulty in precise estimatingremain while very substantial proportions of thefotal provision relate to special employment andGaining measures which are to a large extent^roand determined.   The employment programmeconfidentialfor 1978-79 again contains new demand-determinedschemes and it is too early in the financial year to assess any possible shortfall.FUNCTIONING OF THE LABOUR MARKET77. This programme aims to improve thefunctioning of the labour market through theservices provided by the Department of Employ-mcnt. the MSC and local authorities.Manpower Services Commission78. The expenditure of the MSC is financedmainly by a grant in aid which is borne on the vote of the Department of Employment but fundedin part by the Scottish Economic Planning Depart-ment and by the Welsh Office. The Scottish and welsh contributions reflect that part of the MSCsplans and programmes for Scotland and wales which can be presented separately. Identifiableexpenditure in the forward years will be of theorder of  60 million a year in Scotland and  35million a year in Wales.79. Following a structural reorganisation theexecutive of the MSC has become a singlemanpower services body absorbing the formerEmployment Service Agency and Training ServicesAgency. The MSC carries out its functions withina general policy framework agreed with the Secre-taries of State for Employment, for Scotland andfor Wales. The provision includes extra resources for additional employment and training facilities to mitigate the effects of high unemployment ( 80million in 1978-79 rising to  156 million a yearthereafter) for the youth opportunities programme,which aims to provide work preparation courses and first hand work experience for 190,000 unem-ployed young people.Employment services and employment rehabilitation80. Provision is included for the continuingdevelopment of the programme as described in cmnd. 7049, and assumes some economies on theemployment transfer scheme. Provision for localauthority expenditure on the careers advisory service and the specific grant for strengthening that service (Cmnd. 7049 II page 27, paragraph 42)includes extra staff required by the continuing high level of unemployment, the development of the33
youth opportunities programme and inescapabledemands by higher and further education students who became a responsibility of the service underthe Employment and Training Act 1973.Additional bid81. An additional provision of  0-4 million is sought in 1982-83 for 200 staff for new jobcentresand the strengthening of placing services for those with special employment needs.Industrial training82. Provision has been made in 1978-79 ( 51million) and 1979-80 ( 25 million) to assist appren-tice and other training in industry in a period of high unemployment. From 1979-80 onwards theCommission will introduce a scheme for the supportof training for vital skills. This will replace theexisting arrangements whereby financial assistance for training in industry is provided through annualspecial measures programmes and key grants. Itis assumed that the overall cost will be maintained at a similar level. In Cmnd. 7049 the Commission^targets for direct training, mainly in skillcentrcsand colleges of further education, included young people for whom financial provision is now madein the youth opportunities programme. The pro-gramme for the direct training of adults is set at83,000 in 1978-79 rising to some 90,000 in1982-83.Redundancy and maternity pay funds payments83. Demands on the maternity pay fund have proved to be less than predicted when the fund was set up; payments to employers are now expectation-ted in respect of 100.000-110,000 women a yearcompared with the 221,000 for 1978-79 onwardsforecast in Cmnd. 7049. Payments from the rcdun-dancy fund are expected to be marginally higherthan&apos; in the previous survey. The resulting netreduced requirements, which are not reflected inthe baseline figures, are as follows:  million1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-8320-3	18-3	18-3	18-3Additional bids84. Rebates to employers from the redundancyfund were reduced from 50 per cent to 41 per cent from August 1977 as one of the measures toreduce public expenditure. Additional provisionof  12 million in each year is sought to reinstate therebate at 50 per cent.Industrial   relations   and   other  labour marketservices85. Substantial provision, amounting in money terms to  333 million in 1978-79 and  95 million in 1979-80, is included for the continuation of theexisting   temporary   measures   to   alleviate thecurrent high level of unemployment.   In addition 45 million in 1978-79 and  42 million in 1979-80is provided for a temporary scheme of short time working compensation to counteract the modi-fications  made   to   the   temporary employmentsubsidy  in  the  textile,  clothing  and footwearindustries required by the European economic commission.   Provision of  10 million in 1978-79and  76 million in subsequent years has also beenmade   for   the   special   temporary employmentprogramme   run   by   the   Manpower services commission which will replace for adults thetemporary employment hitherto provided underthe job creation programme.   Provision of  13million in all years is made for CommunityIndustry.   Provision for these programmes will besubject to annual review in the light of the levelof unemployment.86. Provision is also included for an experimentalsubsidy in limited areas of  20 a week for 6 months to employers to encourage engagement of adultswho have been unemployed for long periods ( 1*million in 1978-79 and  2-5 million in 1979-80).The programme includes  0-7 million in 1979-80rising to  1-2 million in 1981-82 and 1982-83 for grants towards the education and training of tradeunion members to enable them to play an effectivepart in the implementation of employment pro-tection legislation and the improvement of industrial relations generally. The rate of increase reflects the planned build-up in training capacity which isconsidered practicable and necessary. Equalamounts are being provided by the Department ofEducation and Science.Additional bids87. There is an additional bid of  0-3 million in1982-83 to extend into 1982-83 the progressiveincrease in the grants towards the education andtraining of trade union members.34CONFIDENTIAL
Implications for inner cities88. Certain expenditure on Programme 4.7 favourshigh unemployment areas over others, therebyinherently favouring inner city areas. The mainexamples are the youth opportunities programme(YOP), community industry (CI) and the specialtemporary employment programme (STEP). Inaddition STEP and the special employment needsdevelopment programme (SEN) have been biasedexplicitly towards inner cities. The funding arrange-ments for the former allow for priority to be givento schemes in areas which are hardest hit by unem-ploymcnt and those inner city areas which thegovernment has stated to be in need of special assistance. So far as the latter is concerned halfof the 47 SEN employment advisors provided forthe one year experiment have been assigned toinner city jobcentrcs and employment offices.Programmes which do not explicitly favour innercities over other areas but which nevertheless benc-fit them include the jobecntre programme and thetraining opportunities scheme. The additional posts in the Careers Advisory Service arc being related tothe level of unemployment among young people and will similarly favour inner city areas. from july 1978 the small firms employment subsidy is tobe extended specifically to the inner city partner-ship areas.Additional bidsProposed permanent short time working arrangements			  million1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-83245	490	490	490A consultative document has proposed aPermanent 2-ticr system of short time workingcompensation to replace the temporary employmentsubsidy and temporary short time compensation^heme in 1979. The scheme would be national and encourage short time working as an alternativelo redundancy and as an aid to overcoming shortfctBl problems. The first tier, which would operatecontinuously, would provide for 50 per cent of thetoit of the short time payments to employees to be repaid to employers from a fund to which govern-^nt and employers collectively would contributedually. The second tier, for use in times of highff,MlDENTIALunemployment, would provide for Government topay the remaining 50 per cent and the employeesrelated National Insurance contributions where an employer could satisfy the Department of Employ-mcnt that the short time working was an alternative to redundancy. The estimated gross public expen-diture shown above would depend on the levelof unemployment and short time working at thetime. The estimate assumes that both tiers will operate throughout the survey period. The cost would be offset in part by reduced RedundancyFund payments (perhaps  30 million in a full year)and might lead to reduced social security paymentspossibly reaching  200 million in a full year.90. The alternative of extending the temporaryemployment subsidy and temporary short timecompensation scheme would cost an estimated 220 million a year from 1980-81 onwards. But theGovernment would lose the benefit of the collectivecontribution from employers to the permanent scheme, which would also have a larger effect onthe unemployment register.central and miscellaneousservices91. Because of the difficult trading conditions thegrowth in the numbers of workers in shelteredemployment in 1977-78 provided for by the Depart-ment of Employment in Cmnd. 7049 was notachieved. Provision is made for resumption ofmodest growth, and for an increase in the sub-scription to the International Labour Organisationrequired because of the depreciation of the USdollar against the Swiss franc.health and safety at work92. The Health and Safety Commission (HSC) isfinanced by a grant in aid which is borne on the vote of the Department of Employment. The fore-casts are adequate to support the policy outlined inparagraph 53 of Cmnd. 7049 and therefore make some provision for increasing staff of the factory inspectorate in accordance with Ministerial under-takings. There is now also provision for the dispersal of 1,000 staff of the HSCs executive arm,the Health and Safety Executive, to Merscyside, but35
not for any capital expenditure for re-location of the occupational medicine and hygiene laboratories, ifdispersed.Options jor reductions93.

Ifexpenditure from the redundancy and maternity payfunds is taken into account, a further saving of 9 million would be required in most years. By thenature of the Department of Employments expendi-turc other options would involve:(i) severe staff cuts in addition to the goodhousekeeping savings already found.(ii) cutting back expenditure on measures intendedto mitigate the effects of high unemploymentFor instance, reducing the special temporaryemployment programme by 10 per centequivalent to 2,500 places) would bring a saving of about tl\ million each year. Anycutting back of short-term schemes would only significantly affect expenditure in1979-80.Similarly reductions in the HSCs expenditure wouldhave to fall mainly on staff. The effect would be areduction in the Commission^ ability to maintain and enforce health and safety standards.EXPORT CREDITS GUARANTEEDEPARTMENTINTERNATIONAL TRADERefinancing and interest support for fixed rateexport credits94. Expenditure on refinancing in 1976-77amounted to  505 million compared with  544 mil-lion forecast in Cmnd. 6721; the underspend was due to a lower level of net advances than expected.In 1977-78 expenditure on refinancing amountedto - 263 million compared with - 131 millionforecast in Cmnd. 7049; the difference was due both to a lower level of net advances than forecast anda more rapid increase in the level of non-intcrest-bearing sterling sight deposits than expected. Tbelatter led to the banks carrying a higher proportionof the net advances on their own books thanoriginally forecast.95. As explained in Cmnd. 7049. the scheme wasrenegotiated last year with the result that com-commitments taken on after 1 April 1978 are refinancedon a different basis from commitments taken onunder the old scheme which are now divided between the banks and ECGD in the proportionprevailing at 31 March 1978. The following tablecompares the latest estimates for refinancing withthe forecasts in Cmnd. 7049:  million		1978 -79	7979 -80	1980 -81	1981 -82	1982 -83Latest estimates						Commitments	before					1 April 1978		103	-113	-233	-278	-255Commitments	after					1 April 1978		6	27	74	128	173Total	-	109	-86	-159	-150	-82Cmnd. 7049						Commitments	before					1 April 1978		117	-91	-267	-303 (-	-303)Commitments	after					1 April 1978		11	53	151	260	(260)Total Reduced requirements		128	-38	-116	-43 (	-43)		-19	-48	-43	-107	-39The latest estimates show reductions in all years.96. The erratic profile of the estimates is due tothe interaction of expenditure under the old schemeand under the new scheme. It is estimated that thetotal amount of ECGD refinance outstanding under36CONFIDENTIAL
toe old scheme will be  1,980 million by the end of1978-79. Repayments will not be complete untill990 but after 1978-79 the Governments contribu-uon to these credits will start to decline asrePaymcnts to the banks exceed advances on existingCornmitments.

Expenditure on interest support represents thedifference between an agreed market rate on suchborrowing and the fixed rate of return charged by thc banks. It also includes on refinanced loansthe cost to the Government of borrowing forrefinancing less the fixed rate of interest on the loans. The following table compares thc latest estimates with the forecasts in Cmnd. 7049:  million	1978	1979	1980	1981	1982	-79	-80	-81	-82	-83Latest estimates	130	132	121	108	85Cmnd. 7049 .	117	114	110	103	(103)Additional bids/re-					duccd requirements	13	18	11	5	-18These figures arc highly provisional as they dependdirectly on assumptions about interest rates. Therewas no separate forecast of this expenditure in cmnd. 6721 as this item was then included in totaldebt interest. The outturn for 1977-78 was  116million compared with  80 million forecast in cmnd. 7049.Options for reductions100. There are only two ways in which public expenditure on the refinancing of fixed rate exportcredit scheme can be curtailed:i. by obtaining or attracting a larger contri-bution from thc private sector financial institutions which would not be refinance-able with ECGD;ii. by restricting exporters&apos; access to fixed ratesterling credit.The scheme has only just been renegotiated and the banks have been prevailed upon to take on an in-creased share of this finance. It is therefore unlikelythat the banks could take on more without endanger-ing their ability to provide funds for this and othermedium term lending. Any attempt to restrict export-ters&apos; access to fixed rate sterling credits further wouldmake little difference to the forecast for the first two years of the survey because this expenditurerelates largely to commitments already taken on.The scope for securing further switching intocurrency financing is limited by the risk of damagingour exporters&apos; interests. There is some resistancefrom buyers to switching on the present scale.
101. Expenditure on interest support could onlybe curtailed:i. by increasing the fixed interest rate charged;ii. by increasing the proportion of creditfinanced in currency where interest rates have tended to be lower than in sterling.The interest rate charged is usually fixed in relationto the minimum rates allowed under the inter-national consensus governing export credit terms,although where the competition allows, higher rates are charged. A general increase in rates wouldbe difficult to sustain if our competitors did not follow suit. As with refinancing, any attempt toincrease the proportion of credit financed incurrency would only produce material savings inthe later years.Cost escalation scheme102. This scheme was recently extended to 26March 1979 after which, if it were to be continued,ECGD&apos;s powers would need to be renewed byParliament. For 1977-78 a shortfall of  9-3 million in premium income resulted in net expenditure of 1-3 million as against estimated net receipts of 7-7 million forecast. This shortfall in premiumwas due mainly to delays in signature of somecontracts and to other anticipated contracts notbeing awarded to United Kingdom exporters.Additional bids103. Revised estimates since Cmnd. 7049 lead tothe following additional bids and reduced require-commitments :  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-83-1*1	-0-2	-4-0	1-2	2 1The additional bids in 1981-82 and 1982^83 are almost entirely in relation to commitments alreadyassumed by ECGD and are thus unavoidable.DEPARTMENT OF TRADESummary104.

It was agreed in 1977 that specific grants tolocal authorities and other bodies for ConsumerAdvice Centres (CACs) should be extended for oneyear pending the outcome of a PAR-type study of advisory services to the citizen (which in turndepends on the Report of the Royal Commissionon the Legal Profession). It is now clear that sucha study will not get underway for some time andthe department is seeking full provision for CACsfor a further two years and minor provision in1981-82 and 1982-83 for final payments.120. On present plans, substantive provision for support to the National Association of CitizensAdvice Bureaux (NACAB) also ends in 1978-79with only modest contribution towards their centralexpenses continuing throughout the survey period.Like the CACs, support for Citizens Advice Bureauxwill be reviewed in the proposed study of advisoryservices. The DPCP is therefore seeking  0-8 mil-lion in 1979-80 and 1980-81 in order to maintainthe existing level of support to the NACAB for afurther two years, although the full  0-8 milliondoes provide for some expansion.  The department is also seeking an additional  0-1 million in 1981-82and 1982-83 to meet increases in the centralexpenses of the NACAB.121. The department seeks an additional  0-2 mil-lion a year to continue specific grants for local pricecomparison surveys until the end of the survey period.122. The extra  0-2 million a year sought for nationalised Industry Consumer Councils is mainlyrequired to cover the costs of the Ministerialdecision to extend the Councils powers and capabilities and not to overhaul thc present structure-123. An additional  0-7 million a year is sought to cover increased local authority expenditure onthe enforcement of new safety regulations and pricedisplay orders and the enforcement of further orders under the Consumer Act, 1974.of standards and quality assurance124.

confidential.  Roads and Transport3. Under these policies expenditure on the con-struction of trunk and local roads will be main-tained at a broadly constant level, but below thatof earlier years&apos; plans. However in 1977-78 the start of a number of major schemes was delayed,in particular as a result of delays of highwayinquiries, and outturn for trunk road construction in1977-78 is expected to be approximately  60 millionbelow the planned level (as in the 1977 surveyreport). Similar difficulties are expected to causeslippage in the programe in 1978-79. resulting in expenditure some  45 million below the (higher)provision which was made for that year in Cmnd.7049. but this is partly offset by increases in trunk road maintenance, local road construction anddriver and vehicle licensing. These changes havebeen reflected in the baseline figures.4. The Report of the Review of HighwayProcedures (Cmnd. 7133) announced new proceduresto be adopted in highway inquiries. These,together with action on the recommendations inthe Leitch Report and the publication of thegovernments trunk road proposals in Cmnd. 7132,should progressively decrease in the later years the delays in inquiries that have hitherto led to slippagein the programme.5. The outturn of expenditure on local road con-struction in 1977-78 is expected to exceed slightlythe planned level. The provision in Cmnd. 7049for 1978-79 is some  45 million above the earlierPlanned level; as mentioned above, this has been increased by a further  15 million. A sum of  12million has also been transferred from programme8 to cover the transport element of the urban programme for that year. For subsequent years,the Department and the local authority associationsare reviewing the balance between the trunk andiocal road programmes. The Department has also agreed to contribute towards the resources requiredfor transport projects included in the urban pro-Srarnme. but the extent of these is not yet known.Some adjustment in the balance between central*nd local programmes may therefore be necessary*t a future stage.^ Cmnd. 7049 showed a reduction of  55 million on local authority current expenditure in 1977-78compared with the planned level, the reductionsfa&quot;ing mainly on maintenance and administration.Firm information on the outturn is not availablefor some months after the end of the financialyear, but the latest indications are that outturnin 1977-78 will prove to have been closely in line with the Cmnd. 7049 estimate and that expenditurein 1978-79 should not fall below provision, althoughtrends in some of the items, such as bus subsidies,arc difficult to forecast7. Provision for concessionary fare schemes forthe elderly, blind and disabled rises by  33 million over the survey period to cover both increasingtake-up of existing schemes and the improvement ofschemes in areas where present arrangements aredefective. Support for local public transport risesmainly to meet expected increases in the cost of rural bus services. Allocations between the differentlocal transport services arc subject to further review in the ordinary way following discussion with thelocal authority associations and the receipt offurther information on the present level of expen-diture during the autumn. Local authorities havebeen asked to take full account of the problemsof their inner urban areas in preparing their trans-port policies and programmes but the Department ofTransport consider that this should not altersignificantly the balance of spending between thedifferent services.Additional bids8. The progressive application of the EECRegulation on drivers&apos; hours (over 3 years from 1January 1978) may result in an increased require-ment for revenue support payments to bus operators.It is not yet possible to assess the scale of this withany precision but the Departments consider thatallowance should be made at this stage for it tobuild up to some  6 million a year. They expect to be able to provide for this from within theirexisting total provision. Cmnd. 6836 said that new bus grant will be phased out by 1985. Thepublic expenditure effects of this cut in grant are shown in the baseline, but the possible implications for the level of bus revenue support have not beentaken into account.9.

The 2\ per cent reductions in England wouldbe:  million1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-8342-5	42-8	430	430These savings could be made on the trunk road programme, but only at the cost of abandoning thepolicy in Cmnd. 6836. and with adverse effect onthe construction industry. Alternatively part of the saving might fall on local authority expenditure, butthe extent of this and the distribution betweenservices would depend largely on the decisions ofthe local authorities.11. The 21 per cent reductions in Wales wouldbe  3-9 million in each year. As in England itwould be feasible to make savings on road con-struction. But almost the whole of Wales has some form of Assisted Area status and although there hasbeen considerable road building in recent years, the welsh Office believe that the road network is stillinadequate. Any reduction in expenditure wouldhave to be made by deferring the starting dates ofsome planned schemes. That would not only be contrary to the policy of providing a stable level of road building but would also delay roads for whichthere is an industrial need-and possibly put at riskthose of importance to Cardiff and Ebbw Vale.MOTORWAYS AND TRUNK ROADS, ANDLOCAL TRANSPORTSCOTLANDImplications of survey figures12.   By comparison with the figures in the 1977survey report, the out turns in 1976-77 and 1977-78showed the following percentage changes:	1976-77*	1977-7SMotorways and trunk roads	-11	-5	-18	-22	-7	-7Total	-11	-11* Some of the shortfall in 1976-77 had already been taken intoaccount in the survey report figures.13. Because of slippage in some road schemes, theestimated outturn for motorway and trunk road construction in 1977-78 was about  4 million belowthe planned level, but expenditure by centralgovernment on road maintenance was close to the target. At present, there are no indications thatthere will be underspending in 1978-79. The Cmnd.7049 provisions for 1979-80 and thereafter, whichare broadly similar to those in the preceding years,are considered to be adequate for the agreedprogrammes.14. For local transport, latest estimates indicatethat capital expenditure in 1977-78 may have been about  20 million below the planned level. Theoutturn for current expenditure appears to havebeen close to the original estimate. There is, as yet.no reliable information on how expenditure in1978-79 is progressing.15. The allocation of the provision for local trans-port in 1979-80 and later years will depend in parton decisions by Regional and Islands Councils. Itis expected that some major schemes of public transport investment in Strathclyde will be post-poned.  Some reduction in the requirement for con-cessionary   fares   is   also   expected. However,against these savings must be set likely increases on other local transport services. Strathclyde RegionalCouncil plan to accelerate certain road schemeswith industrial benefits or intended to give helpin areas affected by  steel closures.  Additions arealso likely on road maintenance and revenue supportboth for rail and bus services.   Overall, the pro-visions for local transport during the survey periodare expected to be adequate but some switchesbetween services will be necessary after discussion&apos;&apos;with local authorities during the summer haveclarified the adjustments required.Options for reductions16. The 2\ per cent reductions would be  7 million in each year.  It would be possible to find48CONFIDENTIAL
such savings from the trunk road and local transportcapital programmes and perhaps revenue support.However, reductions in capital expenditure would adversely affect the construction industry. Areduction in revenue support would result in citherfares rising more rapidly than inflation or reductions in services, in conflict with the policy in Cmnd. 6836.CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SUPPORTBritish Railways BoardImplications of survey figures17. The largest item in this block is support tothe passenger services of the British railways board. As proposed in the Governments white paper on Transport Policy, the provision for passenger subsidy will remain at the 1975 level in real terms until 1979-80 when it will be reducedby  10 million and by  20 million thereafter. Totalsubsidies are:			  million1978-79 1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-83534-5         533 1	521-4	521-4	521-4Options for reductions18. The illustrative reductions amount to  13-3 million in 1979-80 and  13 0 million in subsequent years. As the pension provision represents the expected cost of existing statutory commitments,the railway business would bear the brunt of any*uch reductions. They could not however be im-mediately absorbed by operating economies or price^creases, the benefits from which only mature overa period of years. The impact would therefore fallon maintenance and thus risk a curtailment of services.National Freight CorporationAdditional bids and reduced requirements  million		1979-80	1980-81	1981-82-2-4 -- 	-3-1	30  The saving of  2-4 million in 1979-80 willavailable to help meet additional ports invest-^nt (see paragraph 26).   There is also a timingchange between 1980-81 and 1981-82.ConfidentialOptions for reductions20. The illustrative reductions are  0-2 million in each year. The application of the illustrativereductions might mean a weakening of the Govern-commitments  reconstruction measures whose aim is toput the NFC onto a sound financial footing in orderto comply with its statutory obligation to breakeven taking one year with another.Scottish Transport GroupOptions for reductions21. The 2t per cent reductions would be  0-1 million in each year. The question of reductionsdepends entirely on fares. If the Government wereprepared to accept corresponding fare increases thesubsidy could be cut.New  bus  grants to  nationalised  industries and private operatorsImplications of survey figures22. &apos; New bus grants arc made for 50 per cent ofthe capital cost of new buses used on stage services.Total investment in new buses by local authoritiesappears as part of their public transport investment and only the grants to the National Bus Company.Scottish Transport Group, the Post Office and private operators are shown here. In the transport policy White Paper (Cmnd. 6836). the Governmentstated its decision that the grant should be main-tained at its present level until 1980-81 and wouldthen be phased out by 1985. This has been takeninto account in the baseline.Options for reductions	23.  The illustrative	reductions   would involvesavings of:		  million1979-80 1980-81	1981-82 1982-830-6 0-6	0-5 0-4Such reductions would conflict with the white paper policy for the level of support for investment by the bus industry.OtherAdditional bids24. The existing provision for Scotland coversinternal shipping services in Orkney. The scottish office wishes to grant-aid shipping services between49
the mainland and Orkney and Shetland. Anadditional  0-7 million each year is needed for this purpose. The Treasury consider thatsuch grants should be the responsibility of thelocal authorities concerned, and should be found from within the existing provision for local trans-port. The Scottish Office consider, however, thatthis would be contrary to the policy that support for trunk routes, where necessary, is provided bythe government.Options for reductions25. The illustrative reductions in grants madeunder the Railways Act 1974 would be  0-2 million for 1979-80 and later years. While such reductionsmight be taken to imply a weakening in theGovernments commitment to secure transfers of freight from road to rail where these are justified on economic, environmental or social grounds, inpractice they would be unlikely to prevent theapproval of suitable schemes for grant.PORTS AND SHIPPINGPorts26. The Department of Transport is proposing anadditional bid to meet the continuing needs of oil-related developments, particularly at Sullom Voe,and to accommodate the provision for non-oil-relatedinvestment that was given up to oil-related invest-ment in the  1976 survey.   The Department isbidding for a net increase for investment		in ports asfollows:				  million1979-80 1980-81	1981-82	1982-8310-6 2-6	2-6	2-4agairist which the following	savings may be possible:			  million	1979 1980	1981 1982	-80 -81	-32 -83Subsidies to National Freight		Corporation	2-4 -	_ _Transport research	0-9 0-7	1-8 1-8Options for reductions27. These would entail reductions of  1-3 million in 1979-80 and  1-2 million in subsequent years.It would not be possible to accommodate cuts and still ensure that supporting port facilities would beavailable to meet industrial needs, particularly theneeds of North Sea oil and oil-related developments.Shipping servicesAdditional bids and reduced reqirements28.  The reduced requirements and additional bidsfor the maintenance of existing policies are asfollows:  million1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-83-0-8	2-2	-0-6	-2-2These largely reflect slippage in construction workon the new building for the Inter-governmentalMaritime Consultative Organisation (IMCO). Thishas resulted in savings in 1978-79 and 1979-80.and additional requirements in the following twoyears, offset partly in 1980-81 and fully in 1981-82by the fact that the provision made in Cmnd. 7049for a rented building for IMCO is no longer necessary. Following the grounding of AmocoCadiz. Ministers have asked for a reassessment ofcontingency planning measures for coping with oilpollution. This may give rise to additional cxpen-diture requirements throughout the survey period.A review of civil hydrographic requirements whichcould also lead to new expenditure proposals isunder way.CIVIL AVIATION SERVICESCivil Aviation AuthorityImplications of survey figures29. The grant in aid to the CAA was underspentin 1977-78 by approximately 40 per cent, mainly for exceptional reasons, such as exchange gains,and also because of savings on staff costs, etc. It isexpected to fall from  17-8 million in 1979-80 to 3 1 million in 1980-81, largely because of higherreceipts from euro control charges. Capital grantsarise only in 1978-79 and 1979-80 for a new controltower at Aberdeen airport. NLF loans are for investment, which will increase with further develop-ment at Sumburgh airport to cope with the increasing traffic generated by the offshore oil industry.    Some of the development costs will50CONFIDENTIAL
initially be met from foreign borrowing but all willbe recovered in due course through higher chargeslevied on the users.Additional bids30.

This item comprises mainly expenditure oncentral government administration, as well astransport research and certain minor items. Policiescan be continued at the present level within the survey provision.Options for reductions35. The illustrative reductions would be  1-2 mil-lion in 1979-80 and subsequent years. reductions in expenditure on transport administration could notbe achieved without a reduction in the presentworkload.   Reductions in extra-mural research of:  million1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-830-9	0-7	1-8	1-8have been offered to offset additional expenditureon ports.

made accordingly but the subsidies requirement in1977-78 was lower than had been predicted.Prospects for 1978-79 are still uncertain.4. There are various complicated reasons for the shortfall on capital expenditure. Some programmes were trimmed, and controls over new housebuildingreintroduced in July 1976; the impact of the controls which were generally being applied to capital programmes will have affected the outturnfigures for 1976-77.5. For 1977-78, there is a complex mixture of under- and overspending on different programmes.Later monitoring returns indicate both less totalunderspending and in particular less underspendingon capital programmes. This underspend is anywayexaggerated by the effect of increased local authoritysales receipts and mortgage repayments. On thepresent provisional figures, it would appear that thevarious measures taken by the department to reducethe shortfall have had their effect.6- For capital expenditure the DOE believe thatthe programme can be managed in 1978-79 so thatthere is a full take-up of resources. The underspendon overall capital allocations made to localauthorities in 1977-78 is likely to be as low as 15 million, and authorities have now gainedexperience with the system.7- Within this overall total, the local authoritynew housebuilding programme estimates are influ-experienced by three main factors: the reduced number ofapprovals in 1977-78. the full take up neverthelessexpected on this part of the programme and theAction taken by Ministers to make full use of theresources provided in the 1978-79 housing investment programme (HIP) allocations. The departmentexpects savings on the new house-building baseline,but these are likely to be offset by an increasedrequirement for the local authority funded housing association programme where outstanding commit-ments are much greater than were previouslySported.^rrentSubsidies^ The baseline subsidy figures are those in Cmnd.7Q49, revalued to 1978 survey prices.  The Cmnd.7049 forecast was based on the following assumptions:i. a forecast of the local authority pool rateof interest based on the economic assump-tions issued in November 1977ii. legislation to allow average rent increases to be in line with the index of money earnings from 1979-80 onwards.9. The baseline forecast has been recalculated,using the same assumptions on earnings, prices and interest rates as Cmnd. 7049, but taking intoaccount changes in data and in policies. The maindata changes are:i. the use of information on local authorities&apos;actual and proposed rent increases for1978-79ii. the revision of the data base from which the forecast of the local authority pool rate ofinterest is derivediii. the use of new data on local authorities&apos;estimates of their spending on items in theHousing Revenue Account for 1977-78 and1978-79.The policy changes are:i. the removal of the rent increase condition for payment of high costs subsidy in 1978-79,in accordance with the announcement on March 1978ii. the introduction of the voluntary borrowingcode (not unique to housing), whereby localauthorities have agreed, at the urging of central Government, to increase the lengthof their borrowing.10. The cost in 1978-79 of removing the rent increase condition for payment of high cost subsidyis estimated at about  0-2 million.11. The average rent level in 1978-79 is estimatedat  6 per week. This is calculated on the basisof local authorities&apos; proposed rent increases for1978-79 as notified to the Department, whichaverage 31 p. If rents go up in line with forecastearnings the average rent level in 1979-80 isestimated at  6-50. This figure would needrevision downwards if legislation is not available59
in time, contrary to the assumption in paragraph(i) above, because of the impact of the no-profitrule. The resulting increase in expenditure would fall to be considered by Ministers, as a policychange.12. The cost of the voluntary borrowing code isestimated to be about  6 0 million in 1978-79 rising to about  31 0 million in 1982-83.13. The effects of the data and policy changes aregenerally to reduce the subsidy forecasts, compared to the revalued Cmnd. 7049 figures. The differencesare as follows:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-83-30-5	-251	-30-9	1-8	62-7These differences arise in particular from a reduc-tion in the forecast pool rate of interest due to the revision of the data base; and a reported rent increases for 1978-79 somewhat greater than the rent increases estimated for Cmnd. 7049 for thatyear.14. The overall effect of the changes in theeconomic assumptions however is to increase thesubsidy forecasts (including new towns and rent rebates) from 1979-80, as follows:	  million1978-79      1979-80      1980-81 1981-82	1982-83-4-5          38-6          82-4 107-6	125.2The combined effect of these changes baseline is thus:	to the   million1978-79      1979-80      1980-81 1981-82	1982-83-35-0         13-5          51-5 109-4	187-9Rent allowances15. The take-up of direct rent allowances hasincreased considerably since the last survey; thedepartments latest forecast shows increased require-ments as follows:  million1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 1982-83-f-7-6        +13-6       +18-6       + 19-6       + 18-6Option mortgage subsidy16. The proposed Budget changes in the rate and structure of income tax will affect expenditure onoption mortgage subsidy. There arc a number ofpossibilities which are as yet unresolved. one possible option is to keep the subsidy related tothe basic rate (i.e. 33 per cent or 34 per cent).This could encourage many existing mortgagors to convert to option mortgages, and additional surveyprovision would then be necessary. A secondoption would be to set a subsidy rate somewherebetween 25 per cent and the basic rate. This wasthe practice in the early years of the subsidy, when there were several tax bands. The survey provision would depend on the level set, and assumptions about take up. A third option would be to set the subsidy of 25 per cent, relating to the reducedband, keeping the subsidy in line, as in recent years,with the lowest normal rate of income tax. Presentcalculations suggest that this would result in public expenditure savings.17. In these circumstances, it is too early toattempt to quantify the public expenditure effect.This must await decisions by Ministers on theappropriate subsidy levels. Any increase in expen-diture would, of course, be an additional bid madenecessary by changes to the tax system rather thanin the interests of housing policy. Taking a neutralposition, i.e. making no allowance for the Budgetchanges, the Department would make the followingforecasts of changed requirements from Cmnd. 7049revalued:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-83-14	7	24	29	33The reduced forecast for 1978-79 reflects lowermortgage rates than previously expected.New arrangements for local authority mortgageinterest rates18. The department consider that from 1979-80a contingency provision should be made for thecost of subsidising local authority mortgage interest rates. The present level of local authority interest rates is causing hardship to many mortgagors andthe Government has proposed legislation to enableauthorities to link the rate they charge to prevailingbuilding society rates rather than to the cost of60CONFIDENTIAL
borrowing, meeting any deficit from, and creditingany surplus to, the rate fund. Although thesurpluses should balance deficits over time thedepartments estimates of interest rates over the survey period suggest that there will be deficits ineach of the years covered.

The Home Purchase Assistance and housing corporation Guarantee Bill was introduced inJanuary 1978 and will provide loans and bonusesfor first time buyers. The baseline figures include a preliminary estimate of the cost of these benefits.On current assumptions the benefits will start tobecome available during 1980-81, after a two-yearsavings period, and an up to date estimate^) of thecost is:  million1980-81    1981-82 1982-83Bonus     .... 7-5 10-5 10-5Loan      ... 57 0 82-5 82-gross total      .      .      . 64-5 93 0 93 0Repayments     ... - -1-0 -40Net total     .      .        64-5        92 0        89 0The net total represents changes to the baseline asfollows:  million7980-8/ 1981-82 1982-83-15-8 11-7 8-7 altered estimate of the cost of this scheme isCQvered by the specific Green Paper commitmenttnat costs of the scheme would be met from^vings elsewhere in public expenditure on housing.Capital&apos; &apos;nal authority investment^- The baseline figures are those in Cmnd. 7049w&apos;lh a reduction of  46-7 million in 1978-79,!) Based on the Bill as amended by Commons Committee,11 April 1978.Confidentialtransferred to other environmental services. On theother hand there are agreed additions of  13-9 mil-lion in 1978-79 and  23-2 million a year thereafter to finance grants for thermal insulation in privatehouses.21. Under the new system of housing investment programmes local authorities are given capital allo-cations in three blocks viz:Block 1 New housebuilding.   Slum clearance.Improvements to their own dwellings.Acquisition of existing buildings.Block 2 Private sector renovation grants. Grosslending to private persons for house purchase and renovation.Block 3 Gross lending to housing associations.Except for allocations for insulation of public sector housing in block 1, authorities are entirely free toswitch funds between programmes within the sameblock, to vire up to 25 per cent of any one block toanother, and to carry forward to the succeeding yearany underspending up to 10 per cent of theallocation for the expenditure block; or to bring forward from the succeeding year an extra amountup to that limit. This means that projections ofexpenditure for the various programmes within theblocks must necessarily be tentative and table 2.7in Cmnd. 7049 did not show a detailed breakdown of provision for local authority investment pro-grammes for 1979-80 onwards. Nevertheless thebaseline figures for the various investment pro-grammes have been individually examined. But it follows from the new system that if trends point toa shortfall or overspend in one programme therecan be an expectation that there will be offsettingadjustments in another.Block 1-New housebuilding22. The major component of Block 1 will continueto be the acquisition of land and the provision ofnew dwellings. The figures in Cmnd. 7049 assumed75.000 dwellings in tenders accepted in 1977, 114,000in 1978 and 100,000 for subsequent calendar years,having regard to assumptions about phasing of workand unit costs of construction. A more recentassessment by DOE suggests that these assumptionsshould be modified, in particular as regards the size of dwellings being built. On this assessment theCmnd.  7049  figures  are  sufficient for 110.00061
approvals in 1978 and 97.000 for subsequent years.It is, however, largely for the local authorities todetermine the size of the programmes within the block and some counter-balancing shifts may beexpected within the block from time to time.23. In the event there were only 64.400 localauthority tender approvals in 1977; the returns in1978 show a slight recovery. At the end of April,there were already 23,000 approvals, over 3.000more than at the equivalent point in 1977 and the trend in recent weeks has been a rising one.24. There were several reasons for the disappoint-ing 1977 figures. During 1977, for the first time,cash limits were extended to all the capital programmes included in HIPs. This control, super-imposed on the unit control system, caused manyauthorities to hesitate. There were also practical problems land acquisition delays, site problems,yardstick and design difficulties and some authoritiestook policy decisions to reduce new building programmes.25. The department accepts that the new buildschemes to be brought forward in 1978 are unlikely to require the full baseline provision. But localauthorities are being encouraged to improve per-formance in 1978; increases to the yardstick inDecember and March should help them. Unitcontrol has now been abandoned, and a greaterfamiliarity with the new investment control pro-ccdures is expected to bring greater skill and confidence in mounting and managing programmes.26. Analysis of the first round HIP bids suggestedthat local authorities might transfer resources from new build to improvement and other programmes in later years, but the department treats these firstreturns with caution. There is doubt about thereliability of the data supplied for later years, andthere is still a considerable backlog of housing needwhich will have to be met by new building,particularly for special groups. It is proposed thatthe survey figures should support a programme of100,000 approvals in 1978 and subsequent years. Onthis basis, and making an estimating increase of 30 million a year to take account of evidence in theHIP returns which suggests that the forecasts forhousebuilding have previously been understated forthe reasons mentioned in paragraph 22. the followingchanges would fall to be made to the baseline. (the forecast assumes steady approval start lags andshortening start-completion lags.):  million1978-79    1979-80    1980-81 1981-82New dwellings -60*       -58 12 32* - 107 million on Cmnd. 7049 revalued.27. If however local authorities chose to continueto propose schemes at the rate of approvals achievedover the last 12 months, or a little more around75.000 dwellings a year further reductions on thebaseline figures would be:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-8340	200	275	300	300The Treasury note that the reduced levels ofapprovals over the past year have occurred through-out the country from all types of authority. Theyarc not convinced that approvals over the next year or so are likely to rise above this level, and considered that for 1978-79 and 1979-80. at least,this represents the more likely course of events. Thedepartment point out that the approval figures for1977 (the lowest since records began) follow directly from the imposition of controls. The department donot believe that if authorities had not been heldback by the various constraints they would pitchIhcir continuing programmes at the level theTreasury hypothecate. Further, any consequentialassumption of overall underspend is invalid becauseof authorities&apos; ability to programme with greaterfacility under the HIP system.Acquisitions, improvements28. The provision for acquisitions has been con-sistentJy underspent in recent years, and a majorincrease in activity seems unlikely in the short-term,beyond a slight increase on the particularly lowfigure for 1977-78. The DOE consider that thissaving will be absorbed by the requirement forslum clearance expenditure for which the baselineestimate is too low and by the increased emphasis on improvement work to the local authority stock.As the following table shows such adjustmentsinvolve changes to the baseline totals only1979-80.62CONFIDENTIAL

The allocations for 1978-79 have beenSeised as insufficient response to the proposals^0ntained within the HIPs and the department i(V\    Propose that an additional allocation of^ million a year from 1979-80 onwards should^ade to the Block 1 programmes.j&quot; There is ample evidence of a backlog of^ Slng need in various parts of the country: it^ Climated that there are nearly 800,000 unfit.^uses which will either need to be cleared orIj Proved; there are large numbers of substandard0uses in ^c        authority stock; there are grow--8 sPecial housing needs.   All of these justify anQ eascd level of local authority investment. The[een Paper indicated that in 1976 there were 2-7&quot;lliiof this need will have to be dealt with by^l0n on the part of the public sector. Authoritiesjjl be expected to respond to enhanced^^tions to the benefit of those in housing needjr *CU as to the construction industry. Theasury point out that the estimate of 2-7 millionl0n households in England and Wales living inKable conditions: it is reasonable to expect thathouseholds in the Green Paper includes those whoshare voluntarily; that the majority of unsatisfactoryhouses are in the private sector whereas the bid isfor increased investment in the public sector; andthat, as mentioned in paragraph 62 below, on the green Paper projection a level of public expendituresome  250 million a year lower than that containedin Cmnd. 7049 would be sufficient largely to over-come this backlog of unsatisfactory housing by1986.Block 2 Private sector improvement grants31. The department expects expenditure on private sector improvement grants to increase significantlyin the early part of the period both as a result ofthe changes in 1977 in the cost limits and theadditional publicity drive. On the assumption thatthe average level of grant will increase from about 1.000 to about  1.600 the baseline provision from1978-79 onwards provides broadly for an increaseof 30 per cent on the present level of 60.000 grantsa year. There is not enough evidence to justifyfurther increases in later years, but an improvementin general economic conditions could stimulateadditional demand.32. Legislation has been introduced to providegrants for the thermal insulation of private houses.Initial provision of  13-9 million in 1978-79 and 23-2 million a year thereafter has been includedin the baseline figures.Repairs only Grants33. The 1976 House Condition Survey shows thatthere are some 2 million houses with major defectsin foundations, walls and roofs where the cost of outstanding works exceeds  500. DOE proposea repair grant scheme under which grant aid wouldbe offered towards the cost of remedial action on major structural repair without at the same timegrant aiding routine repair work which the house-holder should be expected to shoulder. At anaverage cost per grant, of say.  500 (towards  1,000
of work) the total cost, assuming say 30,000 grantsa year, would be of the order of  15 million perannum.34. The Treasury recall that the proposals in the green Paper for &quot; repairs only&quot; grants (for a somewhat less ambitious scheme) and other changes to the improvement grant system were included onthe clear understanding that the extra costs wouldbe found from savings elsewhere in the housing programme.Inner cities35. Of the total cash allocation of  2,484 million,for local authority housing expenditure in 1978-79, 775 million (31 per cent) went to partnership andprogramme authorities as compared with 30 percent in 1977-78.Local authority mortgage lending and repayments36. The baseline figures for gross lending reflect the very large reductions made during the 1976survey. The provision of  130 million a year from1978-79 onwards compares with an annual averageexpenditure of  470 million in the five years1972-73 to 1976-77. By 1976-77 lending had beenreduced to  196 million. In 1977-78 and 1978-79the provision has been complemented by the build-ing societies agreeing to make  154 million and 257 million respectively available to local authoritynominees under the support lending scheme.37. In 1977-78. however, only about 66 per cent of the support scheme allocation for England was spent and it is unlikely on present trends that the improvements made in the scheme for 1978-79will secure a full take-up.38. The reductions in gross lending made duringthe 1976 survey have reversed the net balance between expenditure and repayments. If the base-line gross lending figure remains at  130 million a year, the home loans programme will be a sub-stantial net credit to housing up to the end of the survey period. This will increase the pressure from local authorities to recycle the repayments fully in further loans.39. In view of the limited scope for further pro-gross with the building societies support lendingscheme and the continuing high level of loanrepayments on local authority lending, the depart-ment consider the opportunity should be taken tomake additional provision for local authoritymortgage lending. The reduction of  150 millionmade in this programme in December 1976 wasmade on the understanding that further con-sideration would be given to the public expendituretreatment of block lending by building societies tolocal authorities for &quot; on-lending&quot; to mortgagors.But no way has been found of justifiably excludingsuch transactions from the public expenditure figures. The baseline provision of  130 million for1979-80 onwards falls far short of local authorities&apos;HIP bids ( 352 million for 1979-80 and  365 million for future years). The department believes there isa pressing need to make up some of the reductions in local authority lending and suggests an additional 100 million per annum.40. The Treasury point out whatever the case for allowing local authorities to increase their level ofmortgage lending, authorities can choose to virespending into mortgage lending within their HIPtotals. Under the rules such switching could give an increase in mortgage lending of up to  70 million in 1978-79. The substantial mortgage lendingcuts in 1975 and 1976 in face of the overriding need to contain public expenditure stemmed fromdeliberate decisions on priorities by housingMinisters. It follows that reconsideration of thosepriorities does not provide a basis for increasing thehousing totals.Sales (local authorities and new towns)41. The provisional estimates indicate localauthority sales of around 14,400 in 1977-78 and.with 30 per cent of the proceeds covered by privatefinance, net receipts about  10 million greater thanforecast in Cmnd. 7049. The baseline figuresrepresent the price of houses and land sold by localauthorities and new towns, and include provisionfor sales of land as well as dwellings. As they standthey imply council house sales of around 20,000per annum with 80 per cent of the requisite financefrom private sources.42. The department believe that this level of saleswill be reached and that a higher level of landsales is probable. The previous estimate of 80 percent private finance is, however, over-optimistic.An assumption of private finance at 60 per cent in64CONFIDENTIAL

The long term requirements ofe new towns have since been reconsidered in theSnt of the Governments reappraisal of the new^was programme and the new targets which haveen set. As a result, it is considered that the newRebuilding programmes should be reduced to theblowing approval levels:1978 10,3001979 9,0001980 8,0001981 7,0001982 6,000Such1 a reduction is estimated to yield the following&apos;ngs from the baseline figures:v^^^   million*    ^79-80 1980-81 1981-82 1982-832-512-532-542-5*4.^ On house improvement, it is proposed that the-/development corporations  should  become moreved wjtn they- \ocz\ authorities in the work ofi\aQ. rencwal. which would involve an extraMillion on the baseline provision from 1979-80Wards.45,,IS,n8 associations^ch^ ^aselme n8ures are those in Cmnd. 7049,reflect the reductions to housing associationprogrammes made in 1976 which were offset tosome extent last year by a contribution from the october construction package.Housing Corporation programme46. The programme of loan approvals for 1978-79to which the Housing Corporation is now workingis as follows:New building Rehabilitation1978-79      .       . 15,760 15,330(1977-78      .      . 16,735 17,708)There was a shortfall of around  40 million on this programme in 1977-78: but, given the considerabletake-up of loan approvals towards the end of1977-78 and a switch in that year of some  30million of approvals from new building to rehabilitation-tation with a consequent shorter spending profile,the DOE believe that expenditure for this pro-gramme will accord with the baseline provision.The public expenditure provision for this programme is, of course, now supplemented by the use of 34-4 million of private finance (at 1978 prices)as agreed in 1977. It has been announced that additional use of private finance will normally fall to be included in the survey. However, theDepartment does not wish at this stage to make a specific bid for further private finance in thecurrent survey.Local authority funded programme47. On the estimates now made by local authoritiesin HIP proposals of the total of their commitments to housing associations, the forecast of expenditurebased on loan approvals of  85 million per annum(the cash limit and basis of previous forecasts)results in changes to the baseline as follows:  million1978-791979-801981-82+ 60 0+30-5*39-4+ 14-8Training in housing services48. The Department also consider that an urgent need has been demonstrated for improved and increased training in the housing service. Proposalsfor central government to take action and allocatefunds are under consideration, although themachinery is not yet determined. The Treasury note that the cost of the new Housing Training Council65
in Scotland has already been offset within theScottish housing programme, and suggest that theEnglish proposal should be handled in the same way.Summary of savings and additional bids49.

The increased subsidy requirement derivesentirely from the new economic assumptions.Treatment of subsidy increases arising from suchvariations is the subject of discussion between theDepartment and the Treasury.51. The capital programmes have been reviewed in the light of the submitted strategies and theassessments of housing requirements, in line withthe undertaking of Cmnd. 7049. This examinationresults in additional requirements in 1978-79 andthe later years of the period. All the items in list Bare subject to cash limits and controlled by expendi-ture allocations to spending authorities, so there canbe no question of additional expenditure arisingexcept as a result of policy decisions. Thement consider the additional expenditure reqcannot be found from within the existing nprovision.52.   Legislation is required for items A2(d)-and possibly B2(b).   There is no rc(luireIIlC^)rityadditional civil servants but further local au ^manpower will be needed for Bl(c), and Bapossibly Bl(d).53.   The Treasury consider that: 0t(a) Leaving aside item Al the extra bids repa claim on priorities within the housing jand that insofar as they are Jgramme,
worthy or irresistible they should be accommo-dated within the existing baseline total. this total itself runs at a level rising to some 250 million a year above that which the green Paper projected to be sufficient largely to overcome the backlog of unsatisfactoryhousing conditions by 1986 (see paragraph62 below).(o) The HIP system gives local authorities a significant measure of discretion to determinepriorities within their HIP allocations. it follows that additional bids should not be founded on claims for individual componentsof local authority capital expenditure. Therecan be no certainty that any additional money would be spent for the particular purpose forwhich it was sought(c) As noted in paragraph 27 above extra short-fall on local authority new housebuildingunlikely to be switched into other housinginvestment now amounting to some  200million in 1979-80 may well now be in prospect.0pTlONs FOR REDUCTIONS^ The survey rules require illustrative options to^ shown giving the most feasible reductions in^grammes in 1979-80 and later years producinge following minimum reductions to the Englishgramme:  million1979-80 1980-81 1981-821982-8311111411511555   Tf .p^j. 11 savings were to be obtained as a matter ofCv the following action is technically feasible.(q) SubsidiesMinisters&apos; scope for influence is effectivelylimited to the average increases in rents yearby year. Assuming effective legislation in1979-80, the average rent increase obtained for that and later years could be higher thanthe &quot; with earnings &quot; formula so far envisaged.A rent increase of 5 per cent above earnings in 1979-80 and later years would yield savings of about  56 million in 1979-80 and  120million in 1980-81, rising in subsequent years.(b) Local authority capital investmentCommitments will limit the possibility of cutsin 1979-80 but reductions of  50 million inthat year and  100 million a year thereaftercould be made.

It is not possibly to identify precisely whatthe impact of such capital cuts would be; it would depend which programmes were reduced. But if,for example, they were concentrated on the localauthority new building programme, it would involvereducing the 1978 programme by 8,000 approvals ayear, taking action from July 1978.57. All the evidence of the HIPs whatever reser-vations there may be about its precision points to requierements for greater rather than less expenditureprovision. There are no justifiable grounds forpolicy reductions to block 1 programmes. Preser-ving the general stability of the annual allocationsis, in the departments view, a priority. The Govern-ment is under criticism for not meeting statedrequirements already, and arbitrary cuts to theprovision for later years cannot but be damaging tothe whole future of the housing investment system.58. The Treasury point out that additional bidsappear in programme 8 rising to over  320 million by 1982-83 for which DOE can identify no offsetting savings. In view of the fact that the programme 8baseline reflects the DOE&apos;s assessment of prioritiesacross the board, the Treasury believe it to be appropriate, in considering options for reductions onthe housing programme, to identify possible offsetsto the programme 8 bids.67
59.   This would imply the following savings:  million	1979 -80	1980 -81	1981 -82	1982 -83Bids from programme 8 with no				offsets (England and Wales) .	200	232	295	3352^ per cent housing option				(England) ....	111	114	115	115Total	311	346	410	45060. In considering the results of the Housing policy review in 1977, Ministers agreed that there was agood case on merits for reducing the level of generalassistance to housing; and (by a small majority) thatit would be right in future to look for a modestreduction in the level of housing investment.61. On general assistance, modest savings of around  40 million a year could be realised by bringing the rate of option mortgage subsidy into line with the new lowest 25 per cent rate of incometax introduced in the Budget.62. On public sector housing investment, theTreasury note that Cmnd. 7049 contains provisionfor housing capital expenditure rising over the survey period to some  250 million in excess of thecentral Green Paper projection and that the pro-jection would be sufficient to cope with the increasein the number of households and largely to overcome by 1986 the problems of families living in physicallyunsatisfactory houses, crowded or sharing involun-voluntarily as follows:Green Paper projection of housing progress (Englandand Wales)197619811986Households living in overcrowdedconditions, or inhouses that areunfit or lackbasic amenities(thousands)1,800825165Households and families sharingaccommodation(voluntarily andinvoluntarily)(thousands)1,010765555Vacantdwellingsas percentageof stock4- 35- 46- 563. This is the only measure of housing progressprovided in the Green Paper. No estimate is avail-able of the further progress that would be forgoneby reducing provision by up to  250 million ayear in line with the Green Paper central projection.64. The Treasury further suggests that in principle the same progress could be achieved in meeting thebacklog of inadequate housing conditions indentified in the Green Paper at a lower overall level of investment by rearranging priorities as between public sector new house building and private sectorimprovement. The Treasury have identified as an option a reduction of 10,000 a year in the rate ofpublic sector new house building projected in the green Paper offset by the rehabilitation of a&quot;additional 4.000 private sector houses a year andthe acceptance of a vacancy margin rising to 6 percent rather than 6J per cent by 1986. This optionwould imply some modest increase for the immediatefuture in the level of public sector new housebuilding achieved over the last year and could wellrequire new measures to direct resources to theprivate sector houses most in need of improvement-would he65.

In the departments view, the foreg^^0Jsine,licGEN 65graphs are an inadequate description of the ..csituation and of Ministers&apos; decisions on expenditure on housing as recorded mdiscussions.
confidential . Housing68. The department contend that Ministers agreed by a clear consensus that no commitment shouldbe given in the Housing Policy Review to reduce thelevel of investment in housing. As was noted inthe 1977 survey, the Lord Chancellor in his capacity as Chairman of GEN 65 recorded in his note tothe Cabinet that the proposals involved no commit-ment on the future level of housing investment,except to say that we still need a substantial levelof investment in both public and private sectors tohelp with the backlog of poor housing conditions and special needs to provide for future households:and that the level of investment must be determined in the light of the needs identified in the localauthorities&apos; housing investment programmes.69. Indeed the Government has, in the light ofthose needs and the desire to assist the construction industry, made substantial additions to housinginvestment programmes since the 1977 survey.70. The first Treasury option is to bring the rateof option mortgage subsidy into line with the newlowest rate of income tax. The department considerthat the practical and policy implications of doing so go wide of the survey and that it is quitepremature to assume that this option could beviable.^1. Secondly, the Treasury have proposed reducingthe provision for public sector investment by amountsrising to  250 million over the survey period, onthe grounds that the rate of progress projected inthe Green Paper would still be attainable.72. This assumes however that the only form of progress required is to reduce those categories of housing use identified in these particular green paper projections, viz. physically unsatisfactoryhousing, overcrowding, and sharing. But the Green^apcr goes out of its way to emphasise that this13 only part of housing need and that housing111 serious disrepair, housing unsuitable for itsoccupants, and individual housing needs for whichtne public sector has not traditionally catered must also come into the reckoning. The overall objective0f the Government is plainly stated at the outsetto be that all families should be able to obtain adecent home at a price within their means; and that because serious problems remain the Governmentcontinue to give a high priority to housing.73. For these reasons the department has neveracknowledged the Green Paper projections as more than a technical assessment of the implications of trends prevailing at the time. In particular,apparently favourable projections of certain problemsas at 1986 are no guide whatsoever to the optimumrate of attack on all the problems outlined aboveover a survey period through which even thoseprojections are clearly much less favourable. Havingregard to the reservations about these projectionsplainly stated in the Green Paper the department would resist their being invoked in any way tosubstantiate such decisions as the Treasury envisage.74. The department has also considered the secondTreasury proposal to save up to  120 million a yearby rearranging priorities between new public sectorhousebuilding and private sector improvements.75. The proposed net saving accrues largely fromthe proposed reduction in the rate of net additionto the public sector. But housing improvements inany case reduce need only to the extent that theyabate housing unfit or lacking basic amenities, orprolong the life of housing about to be withdrawnfrom the stock. They do not increase the net supplyof housing in the same way as a new house; andthe rate of take up in the private sector cannot even under the most favourable terms be guaranteed.Any reduction in the proposed rate of improvementin the public sector could seriously affect its appealto the desired mix of tenants and impose an effectiveconstraint on tenure choice.76. It follows from what has already been saidthat to plan for a rate of net addition to the public sector even lower than the Green Paper projectionswould be quite unacceptable. It cannot and shouldnot be assumed that the current level of approvalswill prevail throughout the survey period. Nor can the performance of the private sector be taken for granted when the Green Paper projections take no account of adverse monetary and other macro-economic factors.SCOTLANDOutturn and prospects for 1978-7977. The outturn in 1976-77 and 1977-78 was asfollows:

Current expenditure varies mainly with subsidy-dies which in turn vary with interest rates. prospects for 1978-79 are still uncertain but current indlca-tions are that the provision for subsidies is likely tobe exceeded.79. The shortfall in capital programmes in 1976-77was mainly due to the major stock-taking andadjustment of programmes undertaken by housing authorities following local government rcorganisa-tion in the previous year. The provisional shortfallof  9 million in 1977-78 is only li per cent of theprovision, but may require adjustment as more upto date information is obtained.80. In 1978-79 the capital provision, althoughconsiderably less than the authorities&apos; bids, isthought to be sufficient to meet their needs andthose of the new towns and the Scottish special housing Association and is expected to be fullytaken up.General81. The total provision now shown in the baselinehas been reduced each year by about  15 million as a consequence of DHSS assuming responsibilityfor the direct payment of rent rebates and allow-anccs to supplementary benefit recipients. otherwise it allows for the continuance of the programme on the same rising trend and at the same level asproposed in Cmnd. 7049. A substantial part of theprogramme relates to subsidies which are subject to changes in forecast interest rates and other economicassumptions; the balance of the programme con-desists mainly of capital expenditure which depends on the use made by the local authorities, theScottish Special Housing Association, the new town development corporations and the Housing Cor-poration of the capital allocations made to them.It includes the provision of  1-6 million for1978-79 and  2-5 million each year thereafter forthe insulation of private dwellings announced inthe Budget.Subsidies82. Subject to the adjustment referred to in the paragraph above, the baseline subsidy figures arethose in Cmnd. 7049 revalued. Using the sameeconomic assumptions the provision required hasbeen re-estimated taking into account more up todate information about subsidy claims, higher actual expenditure on management and maintenance, andactual changes in the rate at which housing debtis being repaid because of the changing mix betweennew building and improvement investment. Themethod of estimating rent rebates has also been changed. No policy changes are proposed. Thedifference is:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-8310-1	2-2	1-8	6-4	12-783. The forecasts have then been further adjusted to take account of the revised economic assumptions.The general effects arc the same as described above for England. The effect is to increase the subsidyforecasts (including new towns and rent rebates)from 1979-80 as follows:  million1978-79 1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-83-3-4 8-6	18-9	25-8	31-484.  The Treasury	and the	department	are dis-cussing how these changes should be handled inthe survey.Housing investment85. The capital expenditure incurred by the localauthorities, the Scottish Special Housing association and the new towns is mainly on the provision ofnew dwellings and the improvement or modernisa-tion of their existing houses. In addition the localauthorities meet modest expenditure on slum clearance and other investment (e.g. shops, depots70CONFIDENTIAL
and vehicles). The combined baseline figures [i.e.the Cmnd. 7049 forecasts) are expected to be broadly sufficient to meet the programmes presentlyplanned by the local authorities, the scottish special Housing Association and the New Towns;the distribution under the various programme headshas, however, been altered to show a re-assessment of needs as currently estimated by these threeagencies. The detailed breakdown shown in table7 under local authority investment is historical forpast years and tentative for the forward years, thelatter figures being subject to revision followingscrutiny of the yearly housing plans submitted bythe District Councils. The forecasts would besufficient to permit a programme of tender approvalsin the public sector as follows:	1978	1979	1980	1981	1982Local authority .	8,000	9,000	10,000	10,500	10,500SSHA .	2,500	2,500	2,500	2,500	2,500New towns	2,300	2,300	2,300	2,300	2,300Total .	12,800	13,800	14,800	15,300	15,300					together with substantial continuing investment inthe improvement and rehabilitation of older councilhousing the latter particularly in &quot;inner city&quot;circumstances.Dampness /condensation8b\ An additional bid is proposed of  2 million per year to combat serious problems of conden-sation and dampness in public sector houses. AsWell as assisting to achieve reasonable standards ofcomfort in a large number of council houses this expenditure might result in some energy saving to complement the energy conservation measures (at 4 million per year) introduced in the public sectorin December 1977.0&apos;/ier bids I savings87- In addition the following bids/savings are proposed:(a) an increase of  3 million a year in localauthority mortgage lending so as to maintainactivity from 1978-79 in respect of olderhouses and properties not normally accepted for building society finance at broadly the1977-78 level;(6) an increase of  1-1 million in 1980-81 and 1-4 million in 1981-82 and 1982-83 forcentral government loans and grants to first-time purchasers.  The new savings bonus and loans scheme under the Home PurchaseAssistance Bill is expected to attracta larger number of borrowers than previouslyestimated;(c) extra provision for an increase of 300 newdwellings per year from 1980-81 in the housing association programme to meet increasing demands for provision for special needs;(d) offsetting increases in the repayment of loans.The increased requirements and savings are:  million7979 1980 1981 1982-80    -81    -82 -83(i) Improvement/investment(condensation) 2-0 20 20 2-0(ii) Mortgage lending .      .      . 3 0 3 0 3 0 3 0(iii) Loans and grants to first-time purchasers   .      .   1-1 1-4 1-4(iv) Housing Associations   .      .   0-3 2-1 3-9(v) Repayment of loans     .      . -2-1 -2-1 -2-4 -2-6Total ..     2-9    4-3    6-1 7-7Total bids (including sub-subsidies).      .      .      .   13-7  25 0 38-3 51-888.   The Treasury point out that:(a) items (i), (ii) and (iv) fall within the annualblock housing capital allocations made to housing authorities and the Housing Cor-poration, and can and should be offset withinthe existing provision.(b) item (iii) is covered by a specific commitment in the Scottish Housing Green Paper (Cmnd.6852) that the costs of the scheme will bemet from savings elsewhere in Scottishpublic expenditure.Options for reductions89. The survey guidelines require the mostfeasible options to be shown of a 2\ per cent reduction for 1979-80 and later years. Such totaloptions covering all programmes would be:  million1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-8316-1	16-8	17-1	171and, spread evenly, would range from  0-1 million a year on housing administration to between 7 million and  8 million on subsidies.  Savings ofConfidential71
that order on subsidies would require rent increasesparticularly in 1978-79 and 1979-80 at rates much higher than envisaged in the Green Paper Cmnd.6852. A 2\ per cent option on subsidies is therefore not illustrated. On the remainder of the programme the most feasible cuts would be:  million	1979	1980	1981	1982	-80	-81	-82	-83Improvements	6-5	4-8	51	5-1New dwellings, etc.	9-6	120	120	120Total	16-1	16-8	171	171The former would cancel out some of the increasesagreed in 1977 and the recent increases for energyconservation. The cut illustrated in new housebuilding would reduce programmes by about 1,000houses per annum and would, like the cut in im-provement, further reduce public sector demand onthe construction industry. A cut in mortgage lendingwould depress the growing interest in home owner-ship and any reduction in capital grants to housing associations would blunt the impetus being givento housing association activity.90. The Treasury suggest that very substantial savings could be secured in Scotland by acceptinga lower target for public sector new housebuilding.The proportion of vacant housing in Scotland isalready higher than in England and Wales.91. The baseline figures include provision foraround 15,000 new public sector houses a year after1979. The assessment of future requirementspublished in the Scottish Green Paper was that onthe basis of present trends around 10,000 newdwellings a year were needed. Public sector bodiesstarted 10,000 houses in 1977, so the proposal is toallow activity to continue at its present level.Savings rising to about  60 million a year couldbe secured in this way, as follows:  million1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-83			-30	-45	-55	-6092. The Scottish Office point out that the green paper figures were illustrative of needs over a tenyear period but claim that policy considerations,supported by indications in local authority housingplans, require a higher programme in the first fiveyears rather than an even spread, and probablywith a greater emphasis on modernisation as corn-pared with new building than the baseline figuresuggests. They do, however, accept that reductions in new building beyond 2\ per cent would bepossible and could be used to offset Scottish Officeneeds on other programmes.walesOutturn and prospects for 1978-7993.   As in England and Scotland actual expenditurein both 1976-77 and 1977-78 fell below the pro-vision made:  million	Original			provision	Estimated	Per	including	shortfall!	cent	policy	outturn		changes		1976-77			Current	87-1	4-3-7	4-4-2Capital	. 190-2	-43 0	-22-6Total	. 277-3	-39-3	-14-21977-78			Current	99-5	-9-3	-9-capital	115-5	-8-6	-7-4Total .	2150	-17-9	-8-3Current expenditure in Wales varies for the samereasons as in England and Scotland. The Secretaryof State for Wales set up a Working Party in 1977to explore the reasons for the underspend on localauthority capital expenditure in 1976-77. The mainareas of underspend were improvement grants andnew housebuilding. The Working Party reportedthat the significant shortfall on improvement grantswas due to unfavourable economic conditions and high interest rates and that the shortfall on newhousebuilding arose because 1976-77 was the first year in which expenditure had to be containedwithin a financial ceiling. This had created a needin the summer of 1976 for a moratorium onspending with lasting disruptive effects. problems with the weather and with building contractors were also noted.94. The Welsh Office have taken special steps for1978-79 designed to prevent any significant shortfall in capital expenditure. Present indications are thatthere will be no underspend this year.72CONFIDENTIAL

The Welsh Office consider that the!976 Welsh House Condition Survey has established that there remains a great housingneed in the Principality. New housebuildingar,d municipalisation must play a substantial part in meeting this need. Whereas the HIPs.vstem has not yet got fully under way in^ales, authorities have expressed a firm desireto increase their expenditure. The Secretaryof State for Wales considers it important toestablish local authorities&apos; confidence in for-Ward  planning  by  facing  them  with the challenge of a steadily rising programme. Thiswill require additional provision in the later years of the survey.(b) Block II renovation grants and mortgages.The 1976 Welsh House Condition Survey hasunderscored the great need for rehabilitationin the private sector. The baseline provisionfor both grants and mortgages is significantlylower throughout the period than local author-hies&apos; requirements. Extra provision is soughtfrom 1979-80 ( 8-9 million) to 1982-83 ( 13-9million).101. The 1976 Welsh House Condition Surveysuggests that there are about 150,000 houses withmajor defects. The cost in Wales of the &quot; repairsonly&quot; grants scheme, proposed in paragraph 33above, would be about  1-1 million per annum.New towns102. The Secretary of State for Wales has announ-ced an expansion of Cwmbran New Town whichwill require funds above those currently available.Housing associations103. The baseline provision for 1979-80 andonwards drops considerably below that for 1978-79( 28-8 million). Housing associations have beenvery active in the rehabilitation field in Wales andare willing to sustain their efforts in the future.The Secretary of State for Wales proposes theincreased provision necessary for a level programmeof work.Summary of savings and additional bids104. The Welsh Office maintain that offsettingreductions cannot be found from their housingprovision for these increases.105. Treatment of subsidy variations arising fromchanged economic assumptions is the subject ofdiscussion between Welsh Office and the Treasury.As for the other items, the Treasury accept that itmight be sensible to direct more resources towardsimprovements in the private sector, where as the1976 House Condition Survey showed the vastbulk of poor housing conditions are; but considerthat this change, and the others proposed, shouldbe handled by a rearrangement of priorities withinexisting Welsh allocations.&apos;Hdential73

The illustrative options would give savings of  5-2 million in 1979-80 and  5-5 million in subsequent years. The Welsh Office would propose,if necessary, to take these reductions in localauthority housing investment, leaving local author-ities to decide which items to cut within theirallocations for housing expenditure.107. The options proposed by the Treasury for england and Wales are set out in paragraphs 60-65.As indicated in paragraph 66. the Treasury considerthat in view of the faster rate of household formationin Wales and the higher percentage of unfit andolder housing compared with England, the share ofthe proposed reductions to be borne by wales should be 3 per cent instead of the 5 per cent implied by the Welsh share of housing capital expenditure.On this basis the following savings would berealised:  million1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-836-3	9 3	12-3	12-3108. The Welsh Office consider that even a 3 percent share is too high in view of Welsh housing conditions and the fact that the Welsh per capitahousing expenditure provision is much lower thanthat in England. For these reasons, together withthose advanced by the Department of the Environ-ment (paragraphs 67-76 above) the Secretary ofState for Wales considers the Treasury options tobe unacceptable.

The authorised capital expenditure allocationsfor the water authorities were underspent by thefollowing percentages in 1976-77 and 1977-78:Percentages	1976-77	1977-78RWAs	5-4	4-6 (provisional)WWA	43-4	17-2The baseline figure for the WWA in 1978-79 hasbeen reduced to a realistic level in relation to theactual level of spending by the authority in 1977-78.In both England and Wales the moratorium on capital expenditure imposed in December 1976 notonly contributed directly to the underspend in1976- 77 but also had a disruptive effect on thecapital programmes of the water authorities in1977- 78 with a consequential underspend in thatyear. In England, DOE consider that a furtherimportant factor in underspending by the RWAs in1977-78 has been the need to restrict new capitalstarts so as to contain spending within the lowerceiling imposed by Government for 1978-79. they therefore do not expect significant underspending tocontinue.3. The Governments declared priorities for thewater industry remain the provision of services tomeet urgent public health needs, for new housing77
and for industrial development. The authorities&apos;latest plans are intended to meet these objectives.But there are other important issues of concern to both the industry and the Government which can beexpected to have substantial implications for the size of the capital investment programmes notably themaintenance and replacement of old and out-wornassets, the reduction in levels of pollution of rivers,tidal and coastal waters and the need to deal withthe health risk arising from lead in drinking water.The DOE consider that all these issues could leadto additional capital expenditure towards the end ofthe five year period and beyond. The level ofcapital expenditure proposed may therefore requireupward revision in due course. The National WaterCouncil (NWQ has looked at the plans submittedby the RWAs and their general conclusions bear out this view. Expenditure on the schemes to alleviatepollution will be affected by implementation of thcControl of Pollution Act 1974 and the EECDirective on Bathing Waters. The major problemon replacement of assets lies with sewers and watersupply pipes. Although the state of these buriedassets is known to vary considerably throughout thecountry, their condition and, in some cases, theirwhereabouts, cannot be known precisely untilthorough underground surveys of thc network havebeen completed. But in the opinion of thc DOEand the NWC there is clear evidence that in someof the older industrial areas (e.g. Greater Manchester)a policy of major renewal is now required in theinterests of public safety and the protection ofpublic health. Whilst most authorities are at presentable to operate a policy of renewal as and when necessary, the major exception is the North WestWater Authority whose programme is discussed at paragraph 9 below.4. A significant constraint on the level of capital investment is the implications for charges. Mostauthorities accept an aim that average charges should not rise faster than the general rate of inflation, unless this is necessary to finance a realimprovement in the standard of service. Thepresent plans are expected to result in a realincrease in water services charges of only about1 per cent a year. This calculation is, however,very sensitive to the assumptions made about thefuture rate of inflation and the continued use of historic cost accounting. If inflation were to declineor current cost accounting were to be used todetermine prices, the proposed rate of capital investment would result in larger real increases iaprices. Alternatively, if the rate of inflation wereto increase above the 10 per cent a year assumed by the water authorities, the real increase in PnceSwould be correspondingly lower.5.   The authorities&apos; plan divide up capital expenoVture by 14 categories of purpose.  In principle suchan analysis provides a valuable aid to assessment of the plans by showing how much will be allocato various forms of maintenance (31 per cent m1978-79 in the latest plans), and how much to new development (34 per cent), increased demand (per cent) and improvement (14 per cent),practice, however, most schemes are multi-purp0^so that for example many essential maintenanceprojects incorporate a prudent margin for higher standards or greater capacity and part of the cis accordingly allocated to &quot; improvement&quot;. Thus-although the analysis of the programmes sn ^about 15 per cent being spent on improvement e ^year over the survey period, a strict policy ofmailermostimprovements&quot; would result in much ssavings.   Further work is in hand on the. .   . jnyCSt&apos;useful method of analysing thc authorities i&quot;ment plans.6.   An important general feature of the *atindustry is the long term nature of mve (hedecisions both in terms of their impact on condition of the system and on the level of chafgeSto consumers, so that the main impact of en ^(upwards or downwards) in capital allocationstend to be felt towards the end of thesurveytendsunds 1period and beyond.   This considerationreinforce the case on management groiavoiding  marked   fluctuations  in  the &apos;eve spermitted expenditure.Decisions required in the 1978 surveylicies7.

If the savings by the WWA are treated separately, the net additional bid by the^glish authorities is as follows:  million1980-811981-821982-83Total25-832-567-1v far the largest contributor to the additional bid islhe North West Water Authority, which has bid fortoial extra provision of  55-5 million over the survey period. The Anglian Water Authority alsoWlshes to increase its capital spending, primarily in^er to deal with the removal of nitrates fromnnking water and the alleviation of foul water&quot;ooding.^&apos; The North West Water Authority has a particu-,v bad inheritance of old buried assets which4Uhs, for example, in at least one sewer collapseand 30main bursts every day. The replacement costSewcrs alone in their area is estimated by thetoQrity to be in the region of  6,000 million, with much as 15 per cent of this ( 900 million) relatingsewers which arc more than 100 years old, the JQrity of which the authority say are seriously^&quot;loaded and have reached the end of their safeuseful life.  Because of fears that these rates ofapse and bursts might increase in future to a^lnt where resources would no longer be available Cope with essential repairs as they occurred, andanadclil^ 31 ^OI* ^ct) tne authority have taken aUse of their legal liabilities both to third partiestheir own employees (under the Health andKuKaifo    ate decision to plan for a policy of majorProvement to the present standards of their under-recUnd services which they regard as unsatisfactory,0gnising the implications of this for charges.k .1CQ will largely be felt after the end of the surveynod.10. T.da   ine DOE argue that there are environmentalpfo rs in considering a level of capital expenditurev,sion lower than that proposed by the RWAs intheir plans. In particular, failure to increaseexpenditure on the replacement of buried assetswould lead to increasing frequency of sewercollapses, burst water mains, risks to public health and a general deterioration in standards of services.For these reasons the DOE and the NWC accept that the North West Water Authority^ buriedasset problems are more severe than those foundelsewhere in the country and accept that their policyin this respect is justified. The Treasury note thatthe North West Water Authority accept that their previous programme would be sufficient to satisfyGovernment priorities and provide for modestimprovement where the existing level of service isconsidered unacceptable by modern standards; andthat the Authority have consciously decided toadopt a policy on replacement of buried assetsdifferent from that of other authorities faced withthis problem on a significant scale. The Treasuryalso point out that detailed survey evidence on thestate of underground assets is required to providea proper basis for an alternative replacement policy to that of renewal as and when necessary which hasbeen adopted hitherto by all authorities (advancingreplacement by, say, six years can increase the realcost by as much as 50 per cent). Whilst DOE andthe Treasury have some doubts about the NorthWest Water Authority&apos;s ability in practice to achieve a 50 per cent increase above their currentspending capacity, the DOE consider it important that the Authority be given a clear indication ofthe Governments endorsement of their policy andthat this should be implemented as quickly aspracticable.Options for reductions11. 2\ per cent reductions on the baselineprovision for the RWAs in England would amountto the following:  million1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-8311 1	111	11-2	11-2Most of the English authorities&apos; plans involve no significant change from the baseline provision.For them, a 2V per cent reduction would representa relatively small adjustment with little immediate effect on service to customers, although, as notedabove, the effect would become more significant inthe longer term unless the reductions could be
quickly reversed. But for the two authoritiesproposing a significant increase in capital spending,the implications of a decision to hold capital invest-ment by the industry to the baseline level or, afortiori, to impose options for reductions, would ofcourse be much more serious. In this event, theDOE would wish to consider the possibility of some adjustment in the allocation between authorities toavoid a disproportionate reduction in the planssubmitted by these authorities. This could resultin more serious reductions in standards of service in all authorities and in the DOE&apos;s view couldplace Government priorities at risk in some areas.British Waterways Board12. In 1978-79 and 1979-80,  5 million extra was provided each year to deal with the most urgentpublic-safety elements in the backlog of maintenanceidentified in a report by consulting engineers (theFraenkel Report) published in 1977.Additional bid13. It is proposed that a further extra  5 million ayear be provided for the years after 1979-80 toenable the Board to continue to deal with the most urgent work identified by the Fraenkel Report, theextent and urgency of which is likely to be increasedby more detailed investigations now being instituted by the Board. This will help prevent further deterioration and will not pre-empt decisions on the detailed organisational and financial arrangements which will be needed to implement the proposal inthe Governments 1977 Water White Paper to mergethe BWB with the water industry.Options for reductions14. Options for reductions amount to  0-5 million in 1979-80 and  0-3 million in subsequent years.Cuts in the amount of grant available to BWBwould inevitably fall mainly on their maintenanceeffort with consequent increased deterioration,danger to the public and operational difficulties.SCOTLAND15. Provision is included for capital and current expenditure by Regional and Islands Councils inScotland on water supply and the disposal and treatment of sewage to match domestic andindustrial requirements.Capital16. On provisional estimates of outturn, spendingwas about 7 per cent below provision in 1976-7780and about 15 per cent below provision in 1977-78.There were delays in major schemes due to bad weather and industrial disputes in 1976-77; andthe programme was again disrupted by bad weather and by the low level of new housing starts in1977- 78. With so much of the programme-just under half-committed to major projects costingover  2 million, the effects of a slippage will be toincrease the level of committed expenditure in1978- 79 and 1979-80.17. With important new starts to renew outwornassets, to relieve water shortages or to provide adequate standards of disposal ofsewage to &amp;eaccommodated, scope for desirable schemes to im-prove the environment or to meet new legislativestandards will be severely limited. In the Garnockvalley which may be affected by steel closures, a major trunk sewer and disposal facilities will he required to improve its attraction to alternateindustry. A major reservoir will also be requiredto augment the supply of water to Huntcrston.Current18.

Inthe view of the Scottish Office reductions of  2-7miHion in capital expenditure could be achieved with  particular difficulty in 1979-80-by imposinghrther delays on major projects already planned*0r improvements in water supply or standards of^wagc treatment. In the years after 1979-80 itwould be possible by further postponement toCrease the reductions to  4 0 million per year.^ The Treasury notes that this investment pro-frarnme has been significantly underspent in the,ast two years and that it has not been the subjectof a recent thorough review of the kind which in^gland and Wales resulted in significant reductionsln the level of survey provision.   In the light ofthethe;Se considerations, the Treasury&apos;s view is thatre should be scope for additional reductions of^ to  5 million per year to provide offsettingtowards the additional bids made by the^ttish Office elsewhere in this programme.*-and drainage: England and Wales^&apos; The baseline includes the following provisionr e*penditure on the Thames tidal flood protection^me and on other arterial drainage:  million0^ tidal scheme^ arterial drainage1978 1979 1980 1981 1982-79 -80 -81 S2 -8370-2 810 53-2 52-6 350380 33-8 33-8 33-8 35-8^ional bids^&apos; Proposals for additional expenditure (net ofbating reductions) are:  million7979-801980-811981-82tidal scheme:/^&apos;Qnal water authorities%!*] authorities .arterial drainage:^onal Water authoritiesTotal .18-3	22-7	-4-3-12-3	-0-9	11-720	20	208-0	23-8	9-4The requirements for the Thames tidal scheme havebeen considerably revised in order to compensate for slippage which has already occurred. Theincreased requirements for other arterial drainageallow for additional expenditure on urgent floodprotection work arising from the exceptional flood-ing in the 1977-78 winter.Options for reductions23. Reductions required to achieve savings of 2\per cent in 1979-80 and later years would be:  million	1979	1980	1981	1982	-80	-81	-82	-83Thames tidal scheme	2-0	1-3	1-3	0-other arterial drainage .	0-8	0-8	0-8	0-9Total	2-8	2-1	21	1-8There are no possibilities of reductions in expendi-ture on the Thames tidal scheme without exposingparts of the area concerned to an unacceptable riskof flooding. A reduction in capital expenditure on other arterial drainage would force the water authorities to cut back on land drainage and floodprotection work at a time when there is an urgent need for improvements to the sea defences following the winter floods.LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES24. These services include refuse collection and disposal; the provision of parks and recreationfacilities; the provision of municipal offices and administration services; planning and environmentalhealth activities; and a miscellany of other services.The forecast of local authority current expenditure is subject to consultation with the consultative council on Local Government Finance and theConvention of Scottish Local Authorities in thecourse of the annual rate support grant negotiations.ENGLAND AND WALESCurrent25. Thc 1979-80 provision is effectively at thesame level as the provision for 1978-79. thereafter the provision rises by about 1 per cent per yearto reflect additional costs arising from changes inthe number and pattern of distribution of dwellingsand the ongoing consequences of capital investment.
26. Expenditure on these services is not withinthe Governments control. Moreover, the services concerned are subject to considerable local pressures.In both 1976-77 and 1977-78 provision and outturnappear to have been in line, though local authorities as a whole underspent on current account.27. The expenditure provision underlying the rate support grant settlement for 1978-79 was howeverover 2 per cent below the expected outturn for1977- 78. That implied continuing reductions inthe standard of services provided and further economies in the use of staff. It would have been for authorities individually to decide how to make these reductions in the light of local needs and circumstances, having regard to their statutory obligations.28. The evidence from their Budget plans for1978- 79 is however that local authorities are plan-ning to spend some  100 million above the provisionfor local environmental services. This is within the context of a projected overspend on local authoritycurrent expenditure generally of some  200 million.In recent years these estimates have overstatedoutturn by varying amounts, and it is probable thatin the event local authority current expenditure,taken as a whole, will be broadly on target. within that total however authorities are likely to havefinanced a level of expenditure on local environ-mental services above the survey provision at theexpense of other services.29. The Department of the Environment and the welsh Office believe that the pressure on authoritiesnot to let services drop below current levels, and indeed to undertake some small measure of improvc-ment, will be such that the 1978-79 level of services will be maintained. Additional provision is there-fore required to reflect what authorities actuallyspend and to ensure the credibility of the surveyprovision to local authorities, bearing in mind thatthere may not be scope for virement in the futurewithin the aggregate planned provision for localauthority current expenditure.Additional bid30. The Departments therefore make the following additional bid which assumes that outturn in1978-79 will be  75 million above planned provision:  million the bid assumes that savings of  15 million r*ryear from 1979-80 will be obtained by the intro-duction of charging for building regulations wor -A decision on this was deferred last year in vie&quot;of the state of the construction industry. H 1assumed degree of overspend in 1978-79 provesbe correct, the suggested provision would allo&quot;local authorities to make only a marginal increasein expenditure on these services after meehUSadditional costs arising from demographic change and the revenue consequences of capital programme-31. How authorities spend any additional provision would be for them to decide. Within this amoun.however, the Department would propose to introduce a new planning statistics return from 1 April ^which is badly needed to improve knowledgelocal planning activities. The additional ProV,^otwould also allow for the small extra coststhatn of the would be incurred by authorities as a resuuimplementation of the Safety of ReservoirsAct-The Department would also be urging authoritiesmake additional provision for the disposal of u -waste over and above the minimum level requby the Civic Amenities Act and intensifyenforcement of existing legislation on litter,ticularly against shops and street traders. Theannual cost of these measures would be less 5 million.Options for reductions32.

Insofar as authorities are likelyo,^0nunue to use revenue to finance these andr activities within the LDS. expenditure isexpected to be considerably higher than the provision in Cmnd. 7049. The Department of the Environ-ment and the Welsh Office, therefore, consider thatthe provision for 1979-80 should be not less than 210 million. In order to maintain the improvedlevel of provision in 1980-81 and later years alreadycontained in Cmnd. 7049. this would requireadditional bids of  70 million in each year. TheDepartments&apos; view is that, even with this additional provision, it will be difficult given the limitations of the Governmenfs means of influence to containexpenditure within planned provision and there willbe little scope for new initiatives.35. The Departments also submit further additionalbids as follows:(i)  2 million in each year to provide for additional smoke control conversion tocomply with a forthcoming e.c. Directiveplacing limits on concentrations of sulphurdioxide. As the Directive is being supportedby the United Kingdom, it is important that progress should be seen to be made towardscomplying with the limits by the expectedimplementation date of 1 April 1982.(ii)  60 million over the survey period fornecessary improvements and renewal of wastefacilities to enable local authorities todischarge their responsibilities under alreadyimplemented provisions of Part 1 of theControl of Pollution Act 1974.^IDENTIAL83

The Treasury notes the view that the Govern-ment lacks the power to enforce such low levels ofexpenditure as those planned for 1979-80 onwards;but points out that these low levels of expenditurereflect the policy choices exercised by the secretaries of State concerned within the totals of expenditure(including housing) for which they are responsible.On the further additional bids in respect of controlof pollution measures, the Treasury notes that inpractice there remains a considerable measure of flexibility in the timing of this expenditure and that,given the nature of the LDS arrangements, there canbe no guarantee that extra resources would in fact be used by local authorities for these purposes.Key sector : coast protection and derelict land37. The 1977 report (paragraph 8.25) said that the incidence of coast protection work was unpredictableas it was determined by the effects of sea andweather rather than by any long-term planning, andalso warned that there could be no guarantee thatthe Cmnd. 6721 provision would be adequate ifmuch major work had to be carried out. Since then there have been the serious storms of the 1977-78winter. The situation now is that the cost ofcoast protection schemes submitted and programmedby local authorities is considerably higher than thepublic expenditure provision and little if any of this can be deferred as authorities tend to leave coastprotection work until it is urgently needed. Allschemes are submitted and investigated by DOEand Welsh Office engineers to see whether savingscan be made or work postponed. An additional provision of  6-0 million, making a total provisionof  11-2 million for 1978-79, was made as part ofthe April 1978 Budget package. In addition, thefollowing bid is made for further resources requiredto cover expenditure on schemes in progress, submitted. or in the pipeline for future years. ^0allowance has been made for emergency works.  miH&apos;oD1979S01980S1        1981S2 1982S32-31-31-31-3The circumstances described above preclude theillustration of any option reductions.38. In England, Government policies forregeneration of inner city areas are creating incrtheeasedliablepressure on the present level of resources avalfor derelict land clearance. Derelict land clearancein Wales is undertaken by the Welsh DevelopmentAgency for which provision is made in programme. In the DOE&apos;s view option reductions could notbe achieved without damage to the Governmentinner cities initiative.LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICESscotlandCurrent39.

^ The Scottish Office consider that thc reduction&quot;nplied by existing provision for 1979-80 is not^z\y to be attained. Expenditure priorities arelocally determined and demand, particularly for^isure and recreation facilities and on refuseElection and disposal services, can be expected to&quot;Crease rather than diminish against the expectation-tat&apos;on of modest growth. There have beenAuctions in manpower since 1976 but furtherAuctions could not be achieved without substan-lial reductions in thc standard of services since there will also be further revenue consequences fromthecontinuing capital expenditure programmes.ne following additional bid is therefore proposed:  million1979-80    1980-81    1981-82 1982-8311-712012-212-4nc above bid assumes eventual spending in78-79 will be  10 million below the budget levelail(l would allow for modest growth (of about 1^T cent) to accommodate the costs of bringing new capital facilities into use but does not include^Pccific amounts for legislative duties arising fromUrther implementation of the Control of PollutionJ?* 1974 or e.c.

Expenditure on replacementsand renewals is expected to continue at a high leveland with ongoing commitments to accommodate,allocations will necessarily restrict many schemes to which authorities attach a high priority. Inorder to allow for additional coast protectionmeasures to remedy storm damage and for thescheme to refurbish Hampden Park the following additional bid is proposed:  million1979-80    1980-81    1981-82 1982-83Capital2-63-63-83-8It would have thc additional merit of maintaining the level of demand on the construction industry.Options for reductions and offsetting savings43. 2\ per cent reductions for this sub-programme would amount to  4-0 million on current ex-penditure,  1-4 million on capital expenditure and 5-4 million in total for 1979-80 and later years.44. In the Scottish Office view, reductions on current expenditure arc unrealistic, requiring severereductions in manpower, closure of facilities and reduced standards of service. Reductions in capitalexpenditure allocations of up to  5 million wouldbe feasible but further delay projects to whichauthorities attach a high priority including assis-tance to industry-and reverse the effects of measures to assist the construction industry in1977-78 and 1979-80. Demand on the block isat a high level in 1979-80 and 1980-81 because ofslippage and delays in schemes in earlier years andfurther constraints on block allocations will divertauthorities to greater capital expenditure fromrevenue for essential replacement of vehicles andsmaller projects which is not subject to direct control. Any reductions would, therefore, fallheaviest on construction work.45. The Treasury notes that the Scottish office have not offered offsetting savings on this pro-gramme to cover the additional bids on localenvironmental services and would therefore expectsuch savings to be found on other programmeswithin the Secretary of State&apos;s responsibility.THE URBAN PROGRAMME46. Expenditure under this programme is con-tained within a number of functional programmes.The full programme is described in more detail insupplementary analysis G.
england and wales47. In England, the Department of the Environ-ment is responsible for co-ordinating the urban programme in consultation with other departments.In Wales the urban programme is administeredthrough Welsh Office functional programmes.48. Ministers decided last year as part of theGovernments new policies for the regeneration ofinner city areas announced in Cmnd. 6845 that thetotal resource provision for the urban programme should be greatly enlarged from a level of under 30 million in 1976-77 to over  120 million from1979-80. This increase was financed largely bysavings in other mainly local authority pro-grammes but also through a limited injection ofnew resources.49. In the view of the Department of the environment and the Welsh Office, despite thelarge increase in resources so recently agreed, the flat level of provision in the years from 1979-80gives rise to both practical and presentationaldifficulties. Current expenditure, whether arisingdirectly, for example assistance to voluntary bodies or additional social workers, or indirectly, asrevenue consequences of capital projects such as new nursery schools and community centres,represents a continuing resource commitment. Theeffect of this is to reduce year by year the quantumof resources available to finance new projects underthe urban programme unless older current expen-diture projects are withdrawn or additional resources are allocated to the programme.50. There is provision for all current projects tobe reviewed after five years and this review will be adhered to strictly. However, the enhanced urban programme is barely one year old and little turnoveris ppssible within the survey period. TheDepartments argue that while a reduction in the requirement for new resources can be expected asthe policy pays off. it would be unrealistic to suppose that this position will be reached early on,and that, on the contrary, without an adequate inputof resources in the early years, it may never bereached.Additional bid51. The Departments therefore submit bids which,on the assumption that new capital expenditureauthorised will be two to three times greater thannew current expenditure, are intended to enable a constant level of new projects to be financed a1succeeding years.  The additional bids are:  mill&apos;0&quot;mo-a i1981-821982-83DOE .Welsh Office301-4602-7904-0The  Treasury  recognise  that  the  inclusion 0recurrent expenditure projects in the urban Pr0gramme inevitably restricts the room available fofthe authorisation of new projects in succeedingyears, and would expect the Departments concerned  to  have  this  point much  in  mind 1determining the selection, balance and turnoverof approved projects.  Although Government pohj-)is to give priority to inner urban areas withinresources available for public expenditure, th^is no commitment that the extent of this prionOshould be increased from year to year, orresources should be provided to finance a consvolume of expenditure on new current expenditur^projects, as well as supporting existing recurprojects.  The partnership and programme aUtn(^eties are now drawing up their first plans on basis of resource allocations for the three yarevie&quot;period 1979-80 to 1981-82.   Until these plans &apos;available later this year, in the Treasury&apos;s viVi neeu5there is no proper basis for determining tneof the inner urban areas and considering the Prtoevision  of  additional   resources. However,Departments consider that by the time these PAr withn1are available it would be too late to proviae wthe 1978 survey the additional resources whichregard as necessary to provide a modest but supply of new resources.52. The Treasury note that, although expend^under the urban programme involves a &quot; ^fof functional programmes, the additional 01 ^England has been submitted by the DcPartnie&quot;tj1erthe Environment.

53- The additional resources for construction workln inner cities in England announced in the 1977Budget were allocated in Cmnd. 7049 as  10-7 million in 1977-78 and  70-2 million in 1978-79.Local authorities have taken longer than anticipatedto get this work started. This, together with the lateAgnation of two partnerships, means that expen-^tare on these schemes will run over to 1979-80.pte Department of the Environment consider it essential that resources be provided for thise*Penditure both for presentational reasons andlo avoid penalising authorities taking part in the^heme. An additional bid, which reflects the expected underspending on the package in 1977-783nd 1978-79, is therefore made for  16 million inl979-80.^- The Treasury note that the phasing of expen-ure under the package incorporated in Cmnd.49 reflected substantial slippage in expenditure^topared with the assumption in the 1977 surveyat one third of the expenditure would fall in?-78 and two thirds in 1978-79; and that the^turn in 1977-78 is now estimated at no morean  5-3 million.   In the light of the sluggishaie of spending achieved so far, the Treasury areuhtful  whether the  amount  of the packagegaining unspent at the end of 1978-79 will inact be as small as  16 million.The figures for 1979-80 and later years reflectmajor expansion of the programme made possible^ lne Governments decision in April 1977 to0cate additional resources to assist deprived innerf(jy areas.   The programme for 1978-79 has beennhtr increased by an allocation of  1 milliona0ni tne extra resources for environmental workjounced in the Budget speech.

In England the public expenditure provisionfor new towns industrial and commercial investmenthas been less than the development corporations&apos;own expenditure bids for several years and theprogramme has therefore been under pressure.Housing investment has gone ahead at a faster rate and the additional bid would restore the balance.There is a particular problem in the big thirdgeneration new towns whose programmes are nowapproaching a peak of development which couldnot be accommodated within the existing totals.There is already a relatively high level of unemploy-ment in the new towns more than half of them have unemployment rates significantly above theirregional averages and the additional investment would provide jobs to take up much of theunemployment. Expenditure in 1978-79 has alreadybeen increased by  8-4 million in a switch of resources within the DOE&apos;s programme. TheDepartment have undertaken to identify offsetting savings for the following consequential expenditure.  million1979-80	1980-81	1981-8218	10	8extra is also required to maintain scopeIn Wales, commercial and industrial developmentwithin the existing designated area of Cwmbran isexpected to be virtually completed by 1982-83.There are small consequential savings in 1979-80

This provision covers the purchase, adminis-trative and interest costs of the local authorities of buying and making available land for privatedevelopment in their areas. The provision is shown on a net basis. Receipts from land disposals willenable the scheme to grow at a greater rate than is suggested by the net public expenditure provision.The scheme is being controlled at present by separateborrowing approvals but it is hoped to move tocontrol mainly by programmes for 1979-80 onwards.58. In the last two years there has been substantialshortfall on expenditure under the scheme: in 1977-78 actual spending was less than 50 per cent of the planned level. In the Department of the Environ-ment&apos;s view, this underspending was largely thcresult of continued sluggishness in the land market and the discouraging effect of the December 1976cuts at an early stage in the land schemes life.For 1978-79 and future years local authorities shouldbe in a position to build on experience gained andto take advantage of the more active land marketnow developing. In the light of this and of the changes being planned to streamline the adminis-tration of the land scheme, the Department of the environment expect that a substantially higher levelof expenditure will be achieved. They accept,however, that 2\ per cent option reductions on thcprogramme would be feasible. These would amountto:  million1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-831-4	1-6	1-9	1-7In the Treasury&apos;s view, the basic factor in the slowdevelopment of the scheme has been the unwilling-ness of Conservative-controlled local authorities toparticipate in it.   The Treasury believe that thestantially underspent in 1978-79. and that reductions should be made on the provision for later years on grounds of realism.   This is discussed furtherparagraph 78 below.wales59.

The transfer of  0 1 million fromngland to Scotland has therefore been made forfoe survey period.Options for reductions^- With the exception of central administrationexPenditure, reductions of 2  per cent would produce savings of  0-3 million in each year from&apos;9-80. This would mean the virtual elimination0* major new works, or further reductions in the^eady restricted provision for minor new works.^toric buildingsMonumentsAND ANCIENTS//gat ions of survey figures^&apos; As from 1 April 1978 accounting responsibility^ancient monuments in Wales and Scotland has^ n transferred from the Department of theFnv&apos;ronmcnt to the Welsh and Scottish Offices.Jorn 1978-79 onwards present figures reflect theaasfer from England of  2-3 million to Scotland^  0-6 million to Wales and the transfer of  0-7&apos;on to the departmental administration sub-^ gramme to cover the cost of non-industrial wagesl Gotland and Wales.   In addition  0-5 millioneach year will be transferred to programme 9Jibilowing the Home Offices assumption of respon-lly for custodians at the Houses of Parliament.. * Comparison of the survey figures with those^Crnnds. 6721 and 7049 (1978 transfers retainedrealism) is as follows :(q) In 1976-77 there is a shortfall of  0-7 millionQn Cmnd. 6721 revalued to 1978 survey prices( 23-6 million) due largely to slippage of several new works schemes in England and negotiations relating to acquisition ofmonuments and compensation to owners.&apos;) In 1977-78 there is a shortfall of 2-5 millionQn Cmnd. 7049 revalued to 1978 survey prices( 25-0 million) due mainly to three factors:tuc starts moratorium of December 1976,delays in the maintenance programme andlhc fact that funds allocated under the con-struction package ( 1-1 million) were notsPent as quickly as expected.V^ENTIALThe shortfalls in 1976-77 and 1977-78 were inparticular circumstances of those years and thereis no reason to expect they will recur. A  2 millionprovision is made for repair grants for historicchurches in use in England by using constructionpackage funds in 1979-80. The survey requirementsmay be to some extent affected by the current policy review on admission charges.Options for reductions67. A 2\ per cent reduction each year would produce savings in England of  0-7 million in1979-80 and  0-6 million in subsequent years.In the Department of the Environments view thesecuts would need to be applied to services that haveno staff clement as any reduction in staffingcomplements would have a serious affect on morale,and on management staff relations. Nor wouldthey want to apply the cuts to money spent directlyon the heritage; reductions would therefore have tobe concentrated on the plans for the provision ofcar parks, toilets and other facilities for visitors(with possible effect on hygiene) and administrationcost unless, in exceptional circumstances, ministers were to agree to a real terms increase in admissioncharges.CENTRAL AND MISCELLANEOUSENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES68. This covers expenditure on departmentaladministration, on environmental research and on environmental bodies (including the Sports Council,the Nature Conservancy Council and the Country-side Commission) and a number of other smallitems.Environmental bodiesAdditional bidsSports Councils69. An additional bid of  2 million in 1979-80 andthe succeeding three years is proposed to enable theSports Council for England to put greater resourcesinto sports facilities in urban areas of special needs and to resume its programme of providing nationalcentres for certain amateur sports. additional provision for the Sports Council for Scotland of 0-2 million in 1980-81 and  0-4 million in later89
years and for the Sports Council for Wales of  0 -1 million from 1979-80 onwards is required to enablethe Councils to develop their schemes of grant aid for sports projects in areas of special need.Nature Conservancy Council70. An additional bid of  1-6 million is proposedin each of the years 1979-80 to 1982-83. TheNature Conservancy Council has never beenequipped on a reasonable financial basis to fulfil the role for which it was set up in 1973, and in DOE&apos;view there are political and policy arguments forsustaining resources at the higher level of 8 million.Countryside Commission71. Additional bids of  1-3 million in each ofthe years 1979-80 to 1982-83 are proposed toenable the Commission to meet an increased call upon their grant aid scheme for tree planting by voluntary bodies and individuals, and to finance a major new 5-year experiment to resolving the&quot; urban fringe &quot; problems of a city of upwards ofan   million population.Other72. An additional bid of  0-4 million is requiredfor each of the years 1979-80 to 1982-83 tosupport OECD activities on the control of toxicchemicals in the environment and to mount anational campaign for the reduction of noisenuisance. The revised role of the Location of offices Bureau will require an additional  0-3 million in 1979-80; requirements for later years will be assessed in the light of the Bureau&apos;s per-formance. To complete the provision for theUnited Kingdom contribution to the united nations Environment Fund an additional  0-million is required for 1981-82 and 1982-83. after taking account of savings elsewhere, the netadditional bid amounts to  0-2 million in 1979-80and  0-4 million in subsequent years. TheTreasury note that, in so far as these bids arise from a rearrangement of DOE programmes in1978-79, the Department have undertaken to find the necessary provision for the later years within its overall allocation. In any event, in the Treasuryview there should be scope for meeting these smadditional requirements through a marginal adjusment of priorities.Options for reductions73. 2\ per cent option reductions applied to these bodies would amount to about  0-6 milhon1979-80 and thereafter.  Such a reduction howevedistributed would be disruptive to some v ^concerned but not impossible given a needsome general retrenchment.Environmental researchImplications of survey figures74.

In the Treasury&apos;s view, however, signifi-cant reductions in the present provision for thecommunity land scheme should be made on grounds of realism, in the light of the slow progress of thescheme so far and the substantial underspending in prospect in 1978-79. These might provide at least 20 million per year towards the option require-ment on this programme. In the view of the depart-mcnt, a cut of this magnitude would do severe damage to the credibility of the land scheme, and could lead to shortages of land in future years.79. There is no prospect of finding the full amountof the offsetting savings required for the additionalbids within the programme. In the Treasury&apos;view, it is necessary to look to the provision for housing as a possible source of these savings, andfor the balance of the option requirement on theprogramme (see paragraph 36 above).80. Option reductions on Welsh Office expenditure would amount to about  3-5 million in all years.In the Welsh Office&apos;s view, the most feasible sourcewould be the capital investment programme of the welsh Water Authority. This would involve afurther reduction in the level of provision indicated by the Authority&apos;s latest plans, which is signifi-cantly lower than the survey baseline.SCOTTISH OFFICE EXPENDITURE:SUMM/VRY OF ADDITIONAL BIDS,OFFSETTING SAVINGS AND OPTIONSFOR REDUCTIONS81.

Apart from the bid for current expenditure onsewerage and sewage treatment, which could be covered by a reduction in capital expenditure onwater services, the Scottish Office have not offeredoffsetting savings on programme 8 expenditure.In the Treasury&apos;s view savings of up to  5 million(in addition to those included in the options for reductions) might be found in the provision for capital expenditure on water services. Insofar asoffsetting savings have not been identified on this programme to cover the additional bids, theTreasury would expect these to be found on other programmes within the Secretary of Statc&apos;s responsi-bility.82.

ENGLAND AND WALESHOME OFFICEGeneral1. Expenditure in law, order and protective serviceshas to be seen against the background of thecontinued increase in crime. Serious offences knownto the police have increased, on average, at a rateof 7 per cent a year over the last 10 years. Thereis little cause to suppose that this long term trendwill not continue. The crime rate has differingeffects on the various services, but has some effecton most of them.2. Over recent years successive cuts have beenmade on capital expenditure and the present profileof that expenditure for the programme as a wholeshows a substantial fall in the later years.  million						1976	1977	1978	1979	1980	1981	1982-77	-78	-79	-80	-81	-82	-83119 1	102-5	111-8	810	770	80-8	80-8The profile of current expenditure does not fullyreflect the prospective growth in crime or thedemands on the services.  million1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-83	Average growth rate1,641-8	1,665-8	1,691-9	1,714-6	1,731-3	1,750-8	1,750-8	1-1%3. In 1976-77, the main shortfall occurcd in prisons( 4-9 million on a planned expenditure of  199-4 million, or 2-46 per cent), and police ( 8-8 million on  1004 million, or less than 1 per cent). Althoughthe final figures are not yet available, the estimateof outturn for 1977-78 shows little shortfall overall.4. In both years prisons net shortfall includedabout  10 million on capital, partly offset by over-spending on goods and services. As a result thebuilding programme has been rephascd and account has been taken of these factors in the provision which is sought for the forward years of the survey.Implications of survey figuresADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICEMagistrates&apos; courts5. In the view of the Home Office the baselinefigures for current expenditure are insufficient tomeet the expected increase of 6 per cent a year incourt business. Revenue from fees and fines, whichoverall exceed the cost of these courts, is expectedto rise but not necessarily at the same rate asexpenditure.6. The provision for capital expenditure will allow the completion of court houses under construction and a small programme of new starts.Legal aid* The survey figures are expected to be adequate&quot;ntil 1980-81 but insufficient thereafter.Criminal Injuries Compensation Board8.   The survey figures are not expected to be adequate in 1982-83 to cover the latest estimates of the growth in applications.TREATMENT OF OFFENDERSPrisons9. The daily average inmate population in 1977-78was 41,600 and is expected to rise to about 44,500in 1982-83. On any one day the population mayexceed those figures by 1,000 or so. In the viewof the Home Office the present provision for current expenditure is inadequate to ensure proper standards of security, control and regime given an increasingly difficult population held in overcrowded conditions.10. The survey figures will allow the completionof building schemes already in progress providing3,900 places over the period (of which about 500are expected to replace existing accommodation)and for a start to be made on one new prisonin 1981-82.Probation and after-care11. The survey figures provide for an increase inthe number of probation officers (outside prisons)from 4,760 to 5.150 by 1982-83; for extension ofthe community service schemes and for the strengthening of existing schemes; for an increase from 960 to 1,080 places in adult probation hostels
and from 108 to nearly 400 places in adult bailhostels. Grant-aided after-care hostel places areexpected to rise from 2,230 to 2,380 by the end of1978-79 and then to remain at that level. Thereis also provision for some capital expenditure onprobation offices within the magistrates&apos; courtsbuilding programme.GENERAL PROTECTIVE SERVICESPolice12. The Home Office assume that Ministers willcontinue to take the same view of the priorityattached to police recruitment as they have in thepast (reflected in previous White Papers in thestatement that if numbers should exceed theestimated growth, provision will be made for additional expenditure within authorised establish-commitments ). The number of police officers fell by 1,300during 1977-78 to 108,200, that is 1,900 below theassumption in Cmnd. 7049. The survey provisionallows for an increase to 113,000 by 31 March 1983.In the view of the Home Office this will not be adequate to cater for an expected increase inrecruitment following the Edmund-Davies inquiry into police pay. The Home Office estimate thatthere will be 116,000 police officers by 1982-83.The survey figures assume an increase in civiliansfrom 41.065 at 1 April 1978 to 44.175 by 31 March1979. but a fall to 42.300 by the end of 1982-83.Additional provision will be required to continuethe increase provided for 1978-79 in the Budgetpackage.13. The provision for capital expenditure on policebuildings allows for completion of schemes under construction and for a modest programme of newstarts on major schemes.Fire services14. The survey figures assume that the existingstandards of fire cover will be maintained; and thatthe number of whole-time firemen, part-time andjunior firemen and of civilian staff will remainconstant. The Home Office consider that theprovision for whole-time firemen would have to be reviewed if the introduction of the shorter working week required an increased number of firemen andthat some reappraisal of capital investment may benecessary when the implications of a shorter working week in the fire service can be fully assessed.of15.

25. The Treasury note that the &quot; Review of criminal Justice Policy 1976&quot; published by theHome Office last year, stated as an objective ofpolicy a reduction in the size of the prison popula-tion and set out ways of achieving this. Non-custodial treatment appears to be more costeffective than imprisonment. The Treasury recog-nisc that the upward trend in the prison populationcannot be reversed quickly but it might bepossible to achieve a stable population bythe end of the survey period. They arc aware of the present overcrowding in prisons, and thelegacy of Victorian prisons, but a continuing pro-gramme of new prison building as proposed by theHome Office would result in a very substantialbuild up of expenditure, for example to about  15million in 1985-86, and there would be conse-quential current expenditure. In the view of theTreasury, any decision to allocate further resources to prison building should take into account thepolicy objective set by the Home Office and thehigher cost effectiveness of non-custodial treatment.26. The Home Office stress that the level of the prison population reflects the rise in serious crimeand the conclusion of courts in many cases that theoffenders must be removed from society for a timewhatever the cost. In the Home Office view thecrime rate is most unlikely to fall. The most that can be realistically hoped for is that by the use ofnon-custodial penalties, where these are appropriate,further increases in the prison population will bekept to the minimum possible, but this would leave a disturbing degree of overcrowding.Police27. The Treasury note the expectation of the HomeOffice that the Edmund-Davies inquiry will resultin a substantial increase in the number of police officers. However, the figures of 116,000 can be no more than a broad assessment of the effect of any new pay settlement on the number of recruits andthe number of those retiring. Should the bid beaccepted but, in the event, the recruitment notachieved, any shortfall would be returned to the contingency reserve.Offsetting savings28. The table below sets out certain offsetting savings which the Home Office consider can beachieved.Home Office offsetting savings			  million at 1978 survey prices		1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-83Magistrates&apos; courts-increased fines, etc. (partly dependent on additional bid)........

The requirement for the years 1979-80 onwardsis a total of 2\ per cent ( 45 million) of the presentprovision of about  1,800 million. The Home office see no practical way of achieving such savings;the following possibilities are purely illustrative.30. Subject to main legislation, some savings couldbe made by reducing or abolishing legal aid orexpenditure on the anti-discrimination bodies but such action would run counter to Government policyover recent years.31. The requirement could be found by closing a quarter of prison establishments, with an appropriatescale of remission and an amnesty, and redundancyof staff. The savings would probably be more than offset by the cost of lump sum redundancy payments and necessary maintenance of establishments while they were being disposed of.32. An alternative option would be to combine the closure of, say 12 prison establishments at a saving of  23 million with a reduction in police manpowerof about 4,000 officers ( 22 million).   This would
take the police service back many years and reverse the much publicised policies of successive Govern-ments. Abolition of traffic wardens would saveabout  15 million a year which would enable the cut in police officers to be reduced to 1,200. None ofthese proposals is feasible, and major legislation toreduce police establishments and to control civilianestablishments would be necessary.33. The Treasury believe that some savings couldbe achieved by an adjustment to the rules for an award under the criminal injuries compensation scheme. This could be done without legislation. Atpresent no compensation under  150 is awarded.A deduction of  150 from all awards would give a saving of about  2 million a year. The Home Office,however, do not consider the suggestion feasible.In their view it would deprive a large number of applicants of a substantial proportion of theirawards under the scheme, would be difficult tojustify on merits, and would encounter severeParliamentary criticism. Moreover the HomeOffice do not think that further economy measures,which would penalise applicants, should be intro-duced now because the number and seriousness of crimes of violence had increased.LORD CHANCELLOR &apos;S OFFICE34. Over the past two years there have beenshortfalls of about  2-5 million a year on expendi-hire on legal aid. The baseline for 1978-79 hasken adjusted accordingly, and the past shortfallhas also been taken fully into account in theoffsetting savings for 1979-80 to 1981-82 shown inParagraph 36 below.Additional bidsThe following bids are to cover the costs of^itional judges, court staff and other costs (egjurors) to service the courts being built, to cope*ith the increasing amount of business and touaprove the legal aid scheme. The larger increases^ these services for the later years reflect a likelyfrowth of 4-5 per cent a year.

These arise from the withdrawal of legal aid from undefended divorce as follows:  million1979-80	1980-81	1981-824-2	5-9	2-6Options for reductions37. The 2\ per cent options amount to  3 million in 1979-80 and  3-2 million in subsequent years. Ifthere were to be no improvement in the legal aidscheme these amounts could be met in 1979-80 and1980-81 from the above savings. Further savings on legal aid in 1981-82 and 1982-83 would require legislation, either to make financial qualificationsmore stringent (difficult to achieve in practice) orto remove entitlement to criminal legal aid in certainclasses of case (which would be controversial).Savings on current expenditure in the higher courts,or in the court building programme would mean even greater delays in the hearing of cases in the CrownCourt. The alternative of increasing civil fees(already raised substantially in recent years) would tend to deny access to courts to poor litigants.CIVIL DEFENCE: FOOD STOCKS38. The baseline contains expenditure of some  4 million per year by the Ministry of Agriculture on food stocks for civil or defence emergencies. Theprovision (about 2f per cent of the value of the stocks) is sufficient for the operation of the depotsand for the regular turnover of the stocks of flourbut not of any of the other stocks.Additional bids  million	1979	1980	1981	1982	-80	-81	-82	-83Re-refining of fat .	1-8	1-8	1-8	1-8Turnover of biscuits	. 0-5	0-5	0-5	0-5Turnover of yeast .	01	01	01	0199
The programme previously contained provision forthe turnover of the stocks of fat, but this was suspended while a new and cheaper method (re-refining instead of sale and purchase) was tested.Scientific advice is that the renewal of about halfthe stocks, which has to be spread over five years,must be restarted as soon as possible, and not later than 1979, if substantial losses are to be avoided.The  1-8 million includes  0-3 million for the replacement of the fat loss in the re-refining process.The  0-5 million is for the purchase of biscuits to begin the turnover of these stocks, which are ageing. 0-1 million is for a similar turnover programme forthe yeast stocks and also for an increase in these stocks to a level corresponding more closely to the flour stocks, which have been doubled in recentyears.Options for reductions39. The 2\ per cent options of  0-1 million in eachyear would involve a policy decision to reduce the stocks below the levels previously authorised by ministers as the minimum necessary to providecover against emergencies.SCOTLANDImplications of survey figuresADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE40. Expenditure on court services and other legalservices is expected to be contained within Cmnd.7049 estimates with the exception of legal aid wherethere has been an increase in demand followingchanges in divorce law and the introduction of legal aid to district courts. This increase is expected to run at 1\ per cent a year. An additional bid hasalso been made to cover the implementation inScotland of the changes proposed by the LordChancellor for increasing the number of peopleeligible for legal aid.Criminal Injuries Compensation Board41. The Scottish Office meet a fixed proportion ofthe cost of the scheme. Additional provision wouldbe required as a consequence of the Home office proposals for the maintenance of the existing schemeand its extension to cover victims of violence withinthe family referred to in paragraph 22.TREATMENT OF OFFENDERSPrisons42. It is estimated that the total number of prisoners in Scotland will increase by about 4 per cent overthe period from an average of 5,000 in 1978-79 toabout 5,200 in 1982-83. a slower rate of increasethan was assumed in Cmnd. 7049. Scottish Officeconsider that the capital provision is insufficient atthe rjeginning of the period for essential maintenance and improvement of the prison fabric and prison officers&apos; housing, and would also have to be supple-mcnted in the later years for phase 2 of the building of Shotts prison.GENERAL PROTECTIVE SERVICESPolice43. The number of police officers at 31 March 1978was 12,000. 600 below the level assumed in Cmnd.7049; police authorities have compensated to someextent by increasing overtime. Taking account of theforthcoming Edmund-Davies report on police pay.the Scottish Office expect police strength to rise toabout 13,000 (close to the authorised establishmentlevels) during the period. Additional provision would be required in the later years of the period to meet the forecast rise in numbers. It is assumed that Ministers will continue to take the same viewof the priority attached to police recruitment as theyhave in the past and that if the growth in numbersis more rapid than expected, provision will bemade for additional expenditure within authorisedestablishments.44. Additional provision is also required to meet the expected rise in pension payments and for commonpolice services requirements and for the establish-ment of the Police Complaints Panel for Scotland,which is contingent on the passage of new legislation.45. The survey figures for capital expenditure on police buildings show as a result of previous cuts,a fall of 38 per cent in the two-year period 1977-78to 1979-80. Police authorities&apos; financial plans showthat this decrease would mean postponing projects which they consider important for operationaleffectiveness. In the view of the Scottish Officeextra provision is required to permit reasonableprogress with the most urgent projects.Fire services46. The survey figures for current expenditurereflect the assumption that existing fire cover will be100CONFIDENTIAL
maintained. The Scottish Office consider provision would have to be reviewed following the introductionof a shorter working week for firemen. They also consider that additional provision for capital expen-diture is required for the replacement of vehicles andequipment and for new construction mainly arisingdirectly or indirectly from North Sea Oil activity.In the view of the Treasury a review of provisionfor the fire services will be required in the light ofthe Home Office report of their investigation into theeffects of the firemen&apos;s strike.civil defence47. There is no provision for the Scottish shareof the replacement of the warning system providedby the United Kingdom Warning and MonitoringOrganisation; this would require additional pro-vision from 1980-81.Additional bids48. Additional bids for Scottish services in this programme are set out below:Additional bids Scotland  million at 1978 survey pricesLegal aid-maintain existing scheme .Legal aid extension of schemeCICB maintain existing schemeCICB extension of schemePrison building programme .Police manpower.....Police pensions   .      .      . .Police vehicles and central support .Police-building programme .Fire-training school running costs .Fire-replacement of capital equipmentFire-building programme (North Sea Oil)Civil defence replacement of equipment .Total.....of which: central government .local authorities.1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-832-3	2-8	3-4	4-40-2	0-4	0-6	0-6 	 	 	010-2	0-2	0-2	0-20-6	01	0-6	1-7 	 	 	0-8 	 	0-7	1-00-3	0-1	0-2	0-21-2	1-2	1-2	1-20-1	0 1	 	0-4	0-2	0-2	0-20-6	0-8	0-8	0-8 	0-5	0-5	0-55-9	6-4	8-4	11-73-4	4-2	5-5	7-72-5	2-2	2-9	40The additional amounts for legal aid are requiredto meet the growth in demand mentioned above and to implement the Lord Chancellors proposals in Scotland. If the proposals by the Lord Chan-cellor, for the improvement of the legal aid scheme in England and Wales, and the proposals for theextension of the criminal injuries compensation scheme, do not go forward, or are modified as suggested by the Treasury, there will be con-sequential adjustments to the Scottish bids.Offsetting savings49.  Possible offsetting savings are set out below:Offsetting savings Scotland  million at 1978 survey pricesCourts-Scottish courts administration increased fines and reduced costsCourts-building programme (PSA).......Courts district courts capital........CICB and other services related to crime......Prisons current expenditure........Pdfce............Total..........of which: central government.......local authorities......1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-830-3	0-4	0-3	0-2 	1-3	 	0-3	0-3	0-3	0-30-9	0-8	0-5	1-0	0-9	0-7	0-70-7	 	 	3-2	3-7	1-8	1-22-6	3-4	1-5	0-90-6	0-3	0-3	0-3
Options for reductions50. The requirement for the years 1979-80 onwardsis a total of 2\ per cent of the base provision ofabout  185 million a year: about  4-6 million ayear. The police service accounts for over 60 percent of expenditure and the Scottish Office considerthat the full option requirement could be reachedonly by supplementing the offsetting savings identified-fied in the previous paragraph by a restriction ofpolice numbers and overtime working, and an almost complete freeze on police building projects. Totalpolice numbers are already well below establishment and a reduction would be a reversal of the policyof recent years and might require legislation to be effective; a reduction of 150 to 250 police would save  1 to  1$ million. The remaining requirement of l\ million to  2 million would have to be found from the building programme. It is very doubtful if cuts in prison establishments and manpower couldbe implemented unless there were drastic changes inthe criminal justice system requiring legislation.

The shortfall on central government expenditureon education and libraries in 1976-77 was about1-7 per cent in volume terms, and in 1977-78 isprovisionally expected to be around 8-4 per cent.Most of the increase in 1977-78 is attributable toa once-for-all technical change in the timing of university grant payments, agreed during the year;without that change, the shortfall would have been about 3-7 per cent. Figures for individual pro-grammes are as follows:SHORTFALL1976-77(*)(at 1977survey prices)  million per cent1977-78(2)Estimated(1978 survey prices)  million per centSchoolsHFELibrariesOther?)Total(Vote)3 04 13 06-45-50-513-619-2064-7[23-5](J)2-46-608- 4(3-0]9- 219-116-51-773-7132-5]8-4(3-7]Notes:(&apos;) Compared with Cmnd. 6393 revalued, adjusted for announcedchanges during 1976-77.(2) Compared with Cmnd. 6721 revalued, adjusted as above.(J) Figures in parenthesis show the remaining shortfall after allowing for the changed timing of university grant payments.(4)The shortfall in this relatively small and miscellaneouscategory was attributable to a number of factors. these included deferment of new regional committees pending theOakes Committee Report, temporary fluctuations in capital grants to community centres and village halls, and in com-pcnsation payments to redundant college of education staff,and administrative savings in the Department of education and Science.In the light of these figures some adjustments havebeen made to the forecasts for capital expenditurein higher and further education and for the BritishLibrary so that there should not be any significantshortfall in 1978-79.Local government. During 1976-77 the Government issued circularsto local authorities in May and August 1976 seekingreductions on prospective capital and current expenditure to counteract an overspend estimated That time to be about 2-8 per cent of total locagovernment current expenditure. In the result, therewas a shortfall on local authority current expend^ture on education and libraries in volume terms1-6 per cent compared with the figures acceptein the 1976-77 RSG settlement. This was largelyaccounted for by savings on the school meal serviceand on non-teaching costs in schools and colleges-SHORTFALL____  million P&quot;&quot;*(Shortfallj^l^+0-6-3-21976-77 (near actual)Schools.....FE......Other education (administration, in-spection, etc.) .School meals and milk .Libraries, museums, etc.Other (e.g. Urban Programme)Total (local authority)-1-22-5-28-7-37-3-47-5-6-4-f 10-5-86-9-1(M-10-2-3-5(N/A)-1-6-   rjQ ^yillProvisional actual outturn figures for 1977-&apos;0not be available until September but infonnau0from the Return of Expenditure and Rates suggea shortfall of about 1 - 5 per cent on local autn0fl.current expenditure on Education and Libraries1977-78 compared with the RSG settlement figu&apos;for that year.

The long-term aim is to provide nursery education for three and four year olds, mainly ona part-time basis, to achieve the aims recommended in the Plowden report: 90 per cent of four yearolds and 50 per cent of three year olds. present policy allows for the number of under fives in infantclasses to remain constant at the level reached inthe academic year 1977-78 and for the number ofnursery places to rise progressively throughout the survey period. The annual building programme will allow local authorities to provide nurseryaccommodation on a limited scale through the conversion of surplus places in primary schools. Itis expected that 27 per cent of the three and fouryear age-group will be in nursery classes in 1982-83;the proportion of this age group in nursery classes and in ordinary classes in infant schools will be just over 49 per cent.Primary and secondary6. There will be a 17 per cent reduction inprimary rolls during the survey period, owing to thefall in the birth-rate since the mid-1960s. Pupilsover the school-leaving age are expected to increase,but altogether there will be a 4 per cent reductionin secondary numbers. The fall in the total numberwill produce overall savings on current schoolsexpenditure although the increase in proportion of older pupils will at the same time give rise tosomewhat higher average unit costs. The reduc-tions up to 1981-82 are already reflected in thebaseline figures; the further reduction in 1982-83is estimated at  33 million.7. It was recognised in Cmnd. 7049 that, if stan-dards of staffing were to be broadly maintained during a period of falling school rolls, teachernumbers could not fall at the same rate as pupilnumbers. The main reason for this is that there arelimits to the extent to which, in practice, localauthorities can transfer teachers from one schoolto another or between primary and secondary schools. In addition, as secondary numbers begin to fall from 1979 it will become increasingly difficultto maintain the balance of the curriculum. in recognition of these facts, provision was made in cmnd. 7049 for a margin of 7,600 teachers in eachyear from 1979-80. Provision was also made forthe employment in each year of 1,000 more teachersfor disadvantaged pupils. These provisions are carried forward to 1982-83.   The slight reduction^NFIDENTIAI107
10.   Education and Libraries, Science and ArtsCONFIDENTIALin the pupil: teacher ratio in 1982-83 is mainlyattributable to the changing balance between pupilnumbers in primary and secondary schools. TheDepartment and the local authorities are togetherstudying the rationale of the provision needed to offset the diseconomies of falling school rolls andare seeking to refine the calculation of what isrequired. The large falls (of about 12,000 eachyear) in teacher numbers projected for 1981-82 and1982-83 will intensify both the difficulties in trans-fcrring teachers and the pressures on the secondary school curriculum, and for this reason an additionalbid, which would restrict the falls, is recorded inparagraph 23 (3) (ii).8. The building programme component for basicneeds in primary and secondary schools (secondtable, paragraph 4) is intended to provide the extraplaces to cope with the movement of population from one area to another. The method of cal-circulating this component is under review and thestarts figures mentioned in paragraph 4 are thereforeprovisional. The improvement programme inschool building, augmented in 1978-79 to acceleratesecondary reorganisation, will enable progress to bemade towards remedying the many deficiencies inold schools in areas of special social need. Theprovision for special education, resumed in 1978-79,will provide for a programme to replace the worstold buildings but will leave a substantial backlog.The Department will be discussing with theTreasury the method of assessing school buildingneeds in the light of &quot; A Study of School Building &quot;and the Warnock Committee Report on handi-capped children.School meals9. The baseline figures, taking account of theGovernments recent decision not to increase thecharge in autumn 1978, now imply that the subsidywill first increase from the present level of 50 percent, yet still be reduced to about 25 per cent by1980. That would require the following run of charges for a school meal.Autumn	1978	1979	1980	1981	1982	25p	48p	50p	55p	57pThe increase in 1979 is not realistic. The educationdepartments have therefore reviewed the policy on school meals subsidy and an alternative proposal with the expenditure consequences in the form ofan additional bid, is described in paragraph23(l)(i) below.Higher and further education10.

recurrent cost of moving beyond the 1981-82 totalof 530,000 students is identified as an additionalbid in paragraph 23 (2) (ii) and (iii). Policy on overseas students is at present under review but theexpenditure consequences of the new policy will be contained within Cmnd. 7049 levels of provision.These envisaged that overseas student numbers in higher and further education would fall to 66,000by 1981-82. Projections of non-advanced studentsare now markedly lower than in Cmnd. 7049.Expansion up to 1975-76 was checked in theAllowing year. The reasons for this are being investigated by the Department.

Policy objectives are similar to those inEngland and Wales (see paragraph 5). The annualbuilding programme will allow local authorities toprovide nursery accommodation on a limited scalemainly in areas of social deprivation. It is expectedthat 35 per cent of the 3 and 4 year age group willbe in nursery education by 1982-83; the proportionof this age group in nursery education and inordinary classes in primary schools will then be just under 42 per cent.Primary and secondary17. There will be a 15 per cent reduction inprimary rolls during the survey period, due to thefall in the birth-rate. Pupils over the school leaving age are expected to increase, but overall there willbe a 4 per cent reduction in secondary numbers. Asin England and Wales, these two factors taken together will produce net savings. Those up to1981-82 are already reflected in the baselinefigures: the further savings in 1982-83 are estimatedat  3-6 million.18. The projected pupil-teacher ratios in theforegoing table will permit the employment of 500additional teachers in areas of urban deprivation(mainly &quot;in primary schools), allow for a progressiveincrease in the scale of in-service training, and provide a margin of about 500-700 teachers to offset the operational difficulties of declining rolls aswell as meet the staffing standards recommended inthe Scottish Education Department Circular 819of 1972 (primary) and the Survey &quot;secondary school Staffing&quot; published in 1973. The SEDtake the view that an improvement is required inprovision for teaching staff, particularly in secondary schools because of the need to maintain an appropriate balance of specialist staff in view ofthe likely intensification of operational strains asthe decline in rolls continues. Details of anadditional bid for the purpose are given inparagraph 26 (3) (ii).19. The building programme component for basicneeds in primary and secondary schools is intendedto provide the extra places to cope with the movc-ment of population from one area to another. the schools improvement programme will enable limitedprogress to be made towards remedying deficiencies in old schools.

In^der to provide for essential maintenance of existing^d newly completed premises in the Nationalibrary of Scotland, additional expenditure isQuired as set out in paragraph 26(2)(iv).40DITIONAL BIDSEn8land and Wales^ In the table in paragraph 24, four kinds ofadditional bids are identified;(1) Those related to decisions announced in theBudget statement of 11 April 1978. (the related claims for 1978-79, and in the caseof milk also for 1979-80, have been charged to the contingency reserve and are therefore in the baseline figures.)(i) School mealsThe decision, for reasons of incomes policy,not to increase the charge for the school mealin September 1978 has led to a review of theexisting subsidy policy by the educationdepartments. This presented a number ofoptions. The new policy proposed, which isstill to be referred to the Home and social affairs Committee, would be one of maintain-&apos;ng the charge at about half the cost of theschool dinner approximately equivalent, on present forecasts of inflation, to an annual increase in the charge of 3p from September1979. The expenditure consequences arcshown in the following table as an additionalbid.(ii) Capital expenditure for some years the outturn of local authority expenditure on educational buildings has beengreater than provision in the survey. the excess in 1978-79 is put at  40 million, whichhad to be met from the contingency reserve.The department has established that this dis-parity has arisen in the course of revaluationbetween surveys and by using defectiveformulae linking starts with expenditure andby incorrect recording of expenditure by localauthorities. The additional resources now estimated to be required to match the startsprogramme are shown in paragraph 24. Inthe absence of additional resources on this scale it would be necessary to reduce thetotality of the starts programme set out inparagraphs 4 and 10 by the following amounts:  million1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 1982-8313 8 5 5Even these reductions would not secure morethan  4-6 million savings in 1979-80.(iii) School milkThe additional bid shown in paragraph 24arises from the decision to extend free milk to junior pupils at the discretion of localeducation authorities. The bid assumes a 4lprate of subsidy from the e.c..(2) Those required to maintain existing standards(i) Local authority currentThe number of students in further education in 1976-77 turned out to be less than had been expected in Cmnd. 7049. Unit costs were therefore higher and additional resources would be required to provide at the achievedstandard for the current projection of studentnumbers. The department regards this as abid to maintain existing standards and the costis identified in paragraph 24(2)(i). The treasury on the other hand sees it as a bid to improveCmnd. 7049 standards.(ii) Local authority capitalThe increase in student numbers in bothnon-advanced and advanced further educationbeyond 1981-82 would call for starts pro-grammes of  10  million  and   6 million
respectively from 1979-80. The expenditureconsequences are shown in paragraph 24(2)(ii).(iii) University capital and recurrentTo provide for the growth in universitystudent numbers from 310,000 to 319,000 in1981-82, a starts programme of  10 million from 1979-80 would be needed. The expendi-ture consequences are shown in paragraph24(2)(iii).(iv) Proposed European school at CulhamProvision needs to be made for agreedcapital expenditure on the purchase of suitablepremises for this school for the children ofthose employed on the Joint European Torusproject. The bid arises because this expendi-ture will now be incurred in 1979-80 ratherthan 1978-79 for which the corresponding provision is being surrendered.OFFSETTING SAVINGSThere is a  33 million reduction in localauthority current expenditure in 1982-83,mainly on schools, as a result of fallingnumbers (see paragraph 6). There are also some small savings on Vote expenditure asshown in the Table.(3) Other additional bids. These policies are forthe most part described in the rubrics in the table of additional bids, but notes are providedbelow on certain bids.(i) The Government have announced thatthey will be ready in due course to commit themselves to a mandatory scheme of means-tested awards for 16-18 year olds who stay infull-time education, but that the details and timing will need further discussion. Thedepartment propose a scheme under whichthe full weekly awards would be  7 at schooland  9 in further education. It is estimatedthat awards at this level might attract some45,000 young people to stay on. The expendi-ture figures cover the awards themselves, the related additional institutional costs bothrecurrent and capital, and the cost of payingmandatory awards to students aged 19-f oncourses at present covered only by discretion-ary awards. Possible savings on supplementary benefit payments of about  24 million a yearmight arise but not on this programme.(ii) Sec paragraph 7. The bid implies theemployment of an extra 7.400 teachers in1981-82 and 14.600 in 1982-83, and represents a development of last year&apos;s provision.(iii) This proposal would encourage the recruitment of support staff such as techniciansand librarians and help to make good recentcuts in books and equipment.(iv) This proposal represents an additionalannual programme of  28 million starts from1979-80. It is expected that the greater part,say  17 million, would be used to make it possible to complete secondary reorganisationin most areas by the mid-1980s and  8 million to permit an enlarged programme of otherimprovements in England. The proposalincludes  3 0 million for improvements in wales, of which a quarter would be to com-plete secondary school reorganisation. Theremainder would go some way towardstackling the backlog of improvements partic-particularly in the primary sector (over one quarterof primary schools are pre-1903) and for the adaptation of sub-standard secondary schools,including those on split sites.(x) Under this proposal the number ofadditional places provided last year to comp&apos;e&apos;ment the Manpower Services CommissionsSpecial Opportunities programme for unem-ployed young people would be increased from.000 to 15,000.(4) Bids specific to WalesThese proposals would provide for theestablishment of a permanent body witnresponsibility for promoting the welsh language and for the establishment of a thirdresidential centre for outdoor pursuits and welsh language training.24.

(a) This option saves current expenditure but no capital as the nursery building programme is mainly directed to the conversion of existing primaryaccommodation. Its effect would be to end the gradual movement towards Plowden targets throughthe utilization of spare places in primary schools.(6) This operational margin was introduced onlylast year for the reasons discussed in paragraph 7.Its removal would lead to the deterioration of staffing standards within the schools and toarbitrary reductions in the curriculum.(c) This option would more than cancel out themeasure of improvement introduced last year.id) This option would represent a reversal of apolicy which the Department has been urging on local authorities as an essential contribution to improving the quality of education.115
(e) This option would mean requiring localauthorities to meet only their statutory obligations in the provision of school transport. Legislation toremove discretionary powers would be required tosecure full compliance.if) To suspend the school improvement starts afterthe suspension of the 1977-78 programme wouldmean a standstill for nearly six years in replacingor remodelling the worst of the primary schools.This would bear particularly hard on Wales, for thereason given in paragraph 23(3)(iv).(g) Given the co-operation of local authorities, the savings from school closures could be increasedparticularly if a greater proportion of the places tobe closed were in temporary accommodation, whichis more expensive to maintain.(/i) Suspending special school starts would makeit more difficult to provide adequately for thephysically and medically handicapped at a timewhen the Warnock report on handicapped childrenwill be discussed publicly. It would not be possiblefor the Welsh Office to implement this option: thenumber of places in special schools in Wales issignificantly smaller in proportion to those inEngland.(0 Reducing further education building starts by50 per cent would prevent demand in this age rangebeing fully met.(j) Any of the three versions of this option wouldhave the effect of limiting access to higher education.They all imply the suspension of the Robbinsprinciple.(k) This option is a way of curtailing resources for higher and further education which would notovertly limit opportunities for students, but wouldbe likely to have this efTect to the extent thatinstitutions regarded the resulting staff: studentratios as intolerable.(0 This option would have the efTcct of reducingthe Computer Board&apos;s capital expenditure by 25-30per cent.(m) This option would reduce standards in 1979-80 below the level of provision in 1976-77, reversingthe measure of improvement introduced last year.(n) An annual charge of  2 per borrower is assumed, with exemptions for pupils in schools,students, pensioners and the disabled. It is alsoassumed that legislation could be achieved to enablecharges to be introduced by April 1980.116Scotland30.

The shortfall on the Science Budget in 1-in volume terms, compared with Cmnd.revalued, was some  9 million at 1977 survey Pricf&quot;or about 3 \ per cent.   The shortfall arose because tcash limits did not allow sufficiently for price nexperienced during the year, particularly the sharpincreased sterling costs of international subscnp^tions.   In 1977-78 the corresponding amounjio0very provisionally estimated to be about  6 m^?jat 1978 survey prices compared with Cmnd. ^revalued, or about 2\ per cent.

32. The baseline figures for expenditure by the research councils are as follows:  million1978-79      1979-80      1980-81      1981-82 1982-83267-4 265-7 263-3 263-4 263-4This broadly stationary provision takes account ofan increase in resources agreed last year and included in Cmnd. 7049 of  4 million (at 1977survey prices) in each year of the present survey period, with a further  4 million construction programme in 1978-79 only.33- The redeployment of the Science Budgettowards engineering and other basic scienceswhich underpin Government policies in agriculture,health and the environment has reduced expenditureQn bigscience (high energy physics, space science and astronomy) by some 25 per cent in real termsnetween 1973-74 and 1977-78. There will be afurther reduction in the next year or two but its size will depend mainly on the extent to which&quot;nternational scientific organisations (over whosedecisions the Science Research Council (SRC) hasQnly partial control) are prepared to cut their activities. Before the end of the survey periodSuPport for big science will have fallen to them&apos;nimum required to preserve the UK&apos;s capabilitym important scientific areas in which it excelsand in which beneficial discoveries may be made.^0 further redeployment of resources from bigscience will be possible and the growth of other work will end.Additional bids  million1979-80    1980-81    1981-82 1982-8310 0       15 0 15 0 15 0of whichinstruction .   .   0-4        0-6 0-7 0-7^-  Increases in the Science Budget of this order^ould be used mainly to push forward the Scienceescarch Councils engineering programme, in which growth areas include polymer engineering, marinecnnology, micro-electronics, grinding technology,^mputers,   laser   technology   and postgraduate. ln&apos;ng schemes organised in association with,industry. A substantial sum would also go to otherSearch councils to enable them to take the fullest possible advantage of the many opportunities whichoffer themselves for high-quality research of potential benefit in such fields as genetic manipula-tion, deep geology and the photosynthetic process incrops. All the councils are continually reviewingtheir programmes and priorities, but to support thework described above within the limits of thepresent survey figures would require the abandon-mcnt on a substantial scale of fruitful researchalready in progress, some of it falling within thesame categories as the developments for whichadditional funds are now proposed. This wouldmean the loss of any benefit from past effort and investment.Options for reductions35. Reductions of 2\ per cent in 1979-80 and thefollowing years of the survey period would requiresavings of  7 million in each year. These savings would exceed the increase in the Science Budget justmade in Cmnd. 7049. They would probably be divided equally between the SRC and the otherresearch councils taken together. On the SRC sideno reductions in big science would be possible andthe cuts would have to be borne entirely by itsengineering and other programmes. For the othercouncils, new initiatives would be ruled out and existing activities would have to be reduced. Oldbuildings and obsolete equipment would not bereplaced, redundancies would be likely and therewould be a danger of the permanent emigration of outstanding young scientists.ARTSImplications of survey figures36. The shortfall on central government expendi-ture in 1976-77, compared with Cmnd. 6393revalued, was  1-2 million at 1977 survey prices, or about 1-7 per cent. The shortfall arose becausean expected re vote for the Arts Council, for which provision had been obtained, was not in the eventrequired; this was specific to that year. In1977-78 the corresponding figures are expected tobe about  0-1 million (compared with Cmnd. 6721revalued) at 1978 survey prices, or about 0-1 percent.37. Provision for capital spending on the nationalmuseums and galleries in England in 1979-80 and later years is related to the planned construction programme.   In departments views, largely as a
result of the cuts in 1976, this will not be sufficientto allow more than a minimum programme ofadditional major works to be started during theperiod. Provision for their recurrent expenditure is designed to enable them to open the extensions dueto be completed in 1979-80 and to maintain their general activities at the same level in succeedingyears.38. Cmnd. 7049 allowed for an increase in pur-chase grants for museums and galleries of  1 million from 1978-79 and a further  1 million from1979-80 to help meet the increased sales of heritageobjects. As regards the Arts Council the baselinefigures include an ad hoc transfer mainly from theBritish Library, of  3-5 million for 1978-79.Similar transfers have been made in previous years but they have all been without prejudice to future years. To sustain the level of grant in real terms,an additional  3-2 million would be required from1979-80 onwards. Departments fear that thereduction of 6  per cent in support which the base-line figures imply would fall mainly on the nationalcompanies and the Regional Arts Associations.The reduction would be particularly severe on thclatter because the volume of subsidy provided tothem by local authorities has been declining inrecent years and this trend is likely to continue.Additional bids39. In order to meet these difficulties and providefor expanded services, Departments propose thefollowing additional expenditure in Great Britain.The bids are grouped in 3 orders of priority:(1) Maintenance of existing policies(i) Arts Council and other arts 3-2 million each year from 1979-80 toenable the 1978-79 level of subsidy to bemaintained;(ii) South Bank Theatre BoardCapital expenditure rcphasing,  0-4 million,is now likely to slip into 1979-80.(2) Extension of policies(iii) Royal Opera House, Covent Garden 1 million in 1979-80 as a contribution towards the purchase of the site of theexisting building and  0-8 million in sub-sequent years as a contribution towards thecost of an extension to improve backstagefacilities etc.118(iv) National museums and galleries 0-5 million in 1980-81 and  1-0 million in later years for additional purchase grants to enable the national collections to respond to a continuation of the present trend fofincreased sales of heritage objects.(v) Export control 2 million in each year for the extra costof extending export control to objects oversixty years old.(vi) Public Lending Right 0-5 million in 1980-81 to set up the initialmachinery for the introduction of a schemeof PLR and thereafter  2 million per year for administrative payments and costs toauthors.(3) Extension of policies of lower priority(vii) National Film Archive 0-3 million in each year from 1979-80* toenable provision to be made forsafeguardingthe nitrate-based stock from deterioration.(viii) Arts Council 0-5 million in 1979-80 and 1980-81, &amp;\million in  1981-82 and  1-5 million &amp;1982-83, over and above any increase neces-sary to maintain existing policies, to ProV)scope for new initiatives in artistic activities-40. These additional bids have been put forward in thc first instance by DES although part of t^resources (e.g.  for purchase grants) wouldreallocated to SED and the Welsh Office. Spec&quot;10additional bids relating to Scotland and Wales are shown in the Scottish and Welsh sections. It win&apos;for the Scots and Welsh to decide on the relateorder of priority of these bids as against their sof a Great Britain total.Offsetting savings ^41. Savings towards the cost of the additional ^could only be found within the arts field ^reduction, with consequences of thc kind mentiin paragraph 42 below, in the very activities w ^these bids are intended to enhance.   Some sahave been identified (see paragraph 13 abovthe provision for libraries, which is essensimilar in nature and purpose to that covenn.^tter.arts and is administered together with the:ONFlDEKn^
&apos;n the view of the DES, these savings should be offset against the cost of the additional bids forlhe arts. In the view of the Treasury, however,^vings may not be earmarked for particular usesonly within the programme-they are availabletowards the cost of any additional bids accepted.Options for reductions42. A reduction of 2\ per cent in 1979-80 and later years would result in a cut of  2-2 million ineach year. If the reductions were spread evenly0ver the Arts programme as a whole and theadditional bid to maintain the level of the arts council grant-in-aid were not accepted, the total reduction from the 1978-79 level of central govera-ment provision for the Arts Council would beabout 9 per cent. It would be for the Arts Councilto decide how to allocate the reduction. By wayof illustration there could be a reduction in support for theatre companies and orchestras, RegionalArts Associations, and the programme of con-auction and renovation of theatres and arts-Centrcs in the regions, and the cessation of touringDv the national companies. The museums&apos; and galleries&apos; share of the reduction could well result,n their abandoning their plans for making more01 their contents available in the regions, and in ageneral lessening of the accessibility, security and^nservation of their collections.Wales^&quot;plications of survey figures43- There has been no shortfall on centralGovernment expenditure in recent years, nor do the^clsh Office expect any shortfall in 1977-78. the major part of expenditure (about 85 per cent) is onlhe National Museum of Wales-the remainder isComrnittcd to support specific projects (theEisteddfod and the Cardiff Concert Hall). PlannedProvision falls in real terms during the survey periodkecause these specific projects will be completed.4dditional bidsThe planned provision does not allow forpertain capital works to be carried out at theNational Museum of Wales which in the view oflhe Welsh Office are necessary to improve the level0* maintenance and provide better facilities. Anadditional bid of  0-1 million in each year from97Q-80 to 1982-83 is therefore proposed.Options for reductions45. Given the size and nature of the programme a2\ per cent cut would have to be accommodated inthe capital works programme of the NationalMuseum of Wales which, in the view of the welsh office, is already running at below the level atwhich small but essential maintenance and minorcapital works can be carried out.ScotlandImplications of survey figures46. The shortfall on central government expen-diture in 1976-77 was about  0 1 million or 3 per cent. This shortfall arose from staff vacancieswhich have now been filled. The Scottish education department do not expect any shortfall in 1977-78.The aim of the Scottish Office in this programme for national museums and galleries is to continuethe standard of service of 1978-79 into later years.Insofar as the Scottish Office believe that the levelof provision is insufficient to secure this, anadditional bid, as set out below, is in their viewrequired to meet the needs of essential maintenance and servicing of existing and newly built accom-modation. The Scottish Education Department,moreover, think it is desirable that improvementsshould be effected in the accommodation for theScottish United Services Museum, the NationalMuseum of Antiquities of Scotland and the RoyalScottish Museum. This would involve additional capital expenditure also set out below. So far as local authority expenditure is concerned, the pro-jected level of provision envisages no change in thestandard of service for which there is provision in1978-79.Additional bids47. i.  For maintenance and upkeep of nationalinstitutions:  0-3 million in each year,ii. For improved accommodation for nationalinstitutions:  0 1 million in 1979-80 and 0-2 million in later years. In the scottish education Department view savings to finance these additional bids could only befound by reductions in the very activities which these bids are intended to enhance.Options for reductions48. No options are offered under the arts part ofthe programme, since the 2\ per cent options forthe total programme have been met from education and libraries.

This programme covering Great Britain comprisesthree elements: the hospital, community health(H&amp;CH) and centrally financed services; the family practitioner services (FPS); and loca] authoritypersonal social services (PSS). The cash limitsapplicable to the National Health Service are inEngland DHSS 2, in Scotland SHHD 1 and in wales WO 2. These blocks cover expenditure on health authority revenue, health authority capital and central services. In 1976-77, the allowance madefor expected changes in pay and prices was in-sufficient, so that the actual volume available fell short by about 1 per cent of that planned. In additionvolume is affected by under or overspending indifferent parts of the cash block. In 1976-77 cashspending on all the blocks taken together was almost exactly equal to the cash limit there being a veryslight excess on DHSS 2, and slight underspends onthe other blocks. For 1977-78 present indications are that spending on all blocks overall will be abouti per cent below the planned figure. Plannedexpenditure on the family practitioner services, whichis not-cash limited, depends upon the most recentforecasts of the demand for and availability of services. In 1976-77, the actual outturn was lessthan 1 per cent below the forecast.2. The system for the local authority personal social services is differenL Although the cash limited rate support Grants are based upon central forecasts, asincorporated in the Governments expenditure plans,it is for individual local authorities to take theirown decisions on the totality of their expenditure and its allocation between services. In 1976-77 localauthorities restrained their spending on personal social services to about \ per cent below the Cmnd.6393 level no doubt influenced by the terms of therate support grant settlements in November 1976.which not only reduced the percentage grant for thefollowing year but also included an abatement ofthe cash limits which had been set for additions tothe 1976-77 grant in respect of pay and price increases. Information on the out turns for 1977-78is not yet available.Implications of survey figures3. For the years 1978-79 to 1981-82. the provision is as in Cmnd. 7049. increased in 1978-79 to take account of the special injection of  51-9 millionannounced in the Budget, and in Scotland the extraprovision ( 0-3 million) for probation and after care.For 1982-83 the baseline figure is equal to that for1981-82. in accordance with the basis for preparationof the survey.4. With these adjustments, the basic survey figuresimply the following percentage growths:  million	1978	7979	1980	1981	-79	-80	-81	-82Total programme .	0-9	1-6	2-0	Major components:				H and CH current	0-5	10	1-8	PSS current (local authority)	2-2	20	2-9	NHS capital	-3-5	1-9	-0-4	PSS capital (local authority)	-2-9	13-0*	0	FPS.....	2-9	3-2	30	* This arises from the additions made after the 1977 survey,following reductions in the PSS capital programme in earlier years.122CONFIDENTIAL
5- These baseline figures would:(a) generally allow hospital, community health and personal social services to keep pace withdemographic change and family practitionerservices to keep pace with demand up to and including 1981-82. (This would not be so for hospital and community health services in1979-80-because of the special injection in1978-79-or for all services in 1982-83);(b) allow little improvement in standards before1981-82;(c) not provide for a continuation of the 1978-79injection in later years;W) mean that capital expenditure continued at a level well below that in the first half of the decade;(e) include provision made for the new DHSSresponsibilities at MRE Porton and for vaccinedamage, but not for e.c. directives.4 additional requirementsn w responsibilities6- e.c. directives on the first level general nursefining are to be implemented from 29 June 1979.^ey require for student nurses experience inPsychiatric, geriatic, obstetric and commnunityDursing and mean a loss of service given by students and a need for more supervisory staff.

AND PERSONAL SOCIALSERVICES8. The departments&apos; main policy objectives con-tinue to be the development of priority services (asset out for example in &quot; The Way Forward &quot;, theDHSS 1978 Planning Guidelines. &quot;The WayAhead&quot; and Welsh Office WHC (77)20) and the geographical redistribution of resources with the aim of providing equality of access to health care.These objectives are complementary but progress on both is at present very slow. There are in additionpressures arising from, for example, implementation of the latest government policies on employment,health and safety at work and fire regulations, whichdivert expenditure intended for service develop-ments. The injection of  51-9 million for 1978-79will help with some of the more urgent problems,though if it is not continued in future years thebenefit will be lost. But in the view of departments the real need of the HPSS is for a steady and sustained growth rate at a level significantly abovethe minimum required to maintain standards. Thebaseline growth rates, which fluctuate considerablybetween 1978-79 and 1981-82, do not meet this need even in the last year when the improvementmargin is greatest.9. To make credible progress towards the policyobjectives, departments consider that an annualgrowth rate of some 3 per cent overall for these services on the new 1978-79 base is required, the elements being as follows:H &amp; CH current expenditure (excluding jointfinance) growing at 2\ per cent annuallyPSS (local authority) current expenditure (ex-cluding joint finance) growing at about 31 percent per annum123
plus regular increases in the level of NHS and PSScapital expenditure across the period. Theseadditions would permit significant progress in deal-ing with the kind of deficiencies set out in paragraph10. which illustrates some of the specific ways inwhich progress is being delayed. The additional provision required would be:  million	1979-80 1980-81	1981-82	1982-83H and CH current H and CH capital LA PSS current LA PSS capital	104-2 1821 37-4      62-1 18-3 39-5 8-4 8-2	222-3 93-1 51-7 17-6	352-3 121-9 100-5 29-5The baseline figures for HCH in England include amounts for jointly financed schemes of:						  million	1979-80 1980-81	1981-82	1982-83Current .

The term &apos; centrally financed services &apos; covers the items shown in the HPSS programme as t otherhealth&apos;, &quot;central government personal social ser-vices &quot;, and &quot; central and miscellaneous services &quot;.These include special hospitals for the treatment of patients under conditions of special security, youthtreatment centres, laboratory and similar servicesassociated with health authorities, services for the disabled, the assessment of health service supplies,research, and central contributions to training(including nurse training). Virtually no growth hasbeen allowed for in these services in recent public expenditure plans, and pressures for improvement and development are now very strong. For example,departments believe funds are needed to cover extratraining needs arising from the implementation ofthc Court Report, to promote more preventive work through the Health Education Council and to allowcentral laboratory services to expand in line withthe growth in hospital services. The additional provision sought is as follows:  million1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-834-3	8-4	9-4	10-3EXAMPLES OF PRESSURES ON THE HPSSPROGRAMME11.   Departments would point to the examples given below to illustrate the general problems in more detail.A. Access to hospital services the waiting list for hospital treatment now stands at nearly 600,000-5 per cent more thanthe figure two years ago. The length of time required to obtain in-patient treatment or even to see a hospital specialist for the first time as an out-patient is increasing. In Englanthere are 40.000 &quot;urgent&apos; cases over 60 pefcent of whom have to wait more than one month for treatment. Although some of theadditional  51 -9 million was provided specif&apos;cally for this and will help, more needs tobe done.B. Quality and quantity of services(a) The number of beds for the elderly and theseverely mentally infirm in England is some25 per cent below thc departments targets-Elderly people take up facilities required to treat others or have to be discharged prefliaturely and cared for at home in conditionswhich place an increasing load on distnnurses  and  general  practitioners  and 3unreasonable burden on relatives.   This canresult in an uneconomic use of domicil&apos;3^services or, where these are not availaserious neglect.  The inadequacy of provisions&quot;00for elderly people with dementia is particulserious.   Much of the accommodationexists is wrongly sited, antiquated and 1adequately staffed.   Unfortunately the sameis often true of accommodation that migntreleased through rationalisation of servi(e.g. isolated maternity units).(b) The department has accepted in principle thathospitals should accept remands of mendisordered offenders when resources and m &quot;power permit.   Cost up to  3 million.^.annum; earliest year of introduction l&quot;8(c) Medical advances ^It is important that an up-to-date )eve)^tmedical treatment and technique is ITia&apos;ntaJjjcainot least because the results of new me ^&quot; breakthrough &quot; can prevent apatient^veloping chronic illness, with a continuing
cost of care. For example, joint replacementsimprove personal mobility and lessen the pressures upon health and personal social services.(d) ChildrenMore resources are needed to improve stan-dards. particularly in disadvantaged areas, toreduce the number of children born handi-capped and generally to reduce infantmortality. More health visitors and screeningprogrammes, to detect defects at an early stage, are needed to be able to comply withthe recommendations of the Court Committee,which the Government has accepted inprinciple.C-  Age of capital stockOver half our hospital stock is over 50 years old and there is a backlog of building and engineering maintenance requiring expenditureof over  250 million. The mean age of medical equipment is increasing, with the replacement of radiological equipment become-ing increasingly urgent . The balance betweencapital and revenue is being considered in theDHSS review of capital; meanwhile extracapital is also needed to provide the buildings and equipment required for the priorityservices.^- TrainingFurther expenditure is needed to improve the standards and methods of health service train-ing. The Government has accepted the BriggsReport for new patterns of nurse training,though the timing of implementation remains to be settled. Once set in hand it would cost about  7 0 million in year 1, rising to about 40 million in year 7 and thereafter. TheCourt Report requires improvements in train-ing for a number of health professions con-cerned with children. Additional training isa prerequisite for increasing numbers of re-allocation of staff to under-provided areas e.g.district nurses, health visitors, nurses forgeriatric, psychiatric and mental handicapservices.**ERSONAL SOCIAL SERVICESDomiciliary servicesLocal authorities generally appear to be mak-ing satisfactory provision for the developmentof day care services for the elderly. However,there is a need to increase domiciliary pro-vision home helps, care attendants, meals onwheels. A recent OPCS survey of elderlypeople shows that disabled old people needhelp with basic personal tasks but are notgetting it. Voluntary effort could be helpfulbut requiries additional social work staff toorganise and promote it.F. Residential provision in order to enable the numbers of residentialplaces for elderly people to keep pace withthe projected population increase, taking account of the greater dependence of thoseaged 75 years and over, capital expenditure would have to increase at twice the rateplanned at present. Housing authorities expressincreasing concern that sheltered housing ishaving to be used for elderly people who require the more intensive care of an oldpeoples home. At the level of capital expendi-ture now planned, it will take 15 years andmore to meet White Paper targets for residen-tial provision for the mentally ill and mentally handicapped, and to case the pressure on thehospital services. There are also seriousshortfalls, especially in Scotland, in residentialprovision for the physically disabled and foralcoholics, particularly women.G. Service for the disabledDepartments are concerned at the wide varia-tion in the level of services provided, and seethis as an indication of the large amount ofunmet needs. Faster growth in resources wouldenable them to put more effective pressure on local authorities to implement the ChronicallySick and Disabled Persons Act. There is a particularly serious backlog in the provisionof aids and adaptations.H. ChildrenMajor sections of the Children Act 1975should be implemented to improve theoperation of the care system and make it easier to find substitute homes for childrenwhose own families have broken down. for young offenders, more revenue is needed for&quot; intermediate treatment&quot;. In Scotland funds are needed to provide improved services for children in the community including moreConfidential125
facilities for children appearing beforechildren&apos;s hearings and for developments suchas the community parents scheme and toprovide youth treatment centre facilities. Inaddition, there is a considerable shortfall inthe provision of day care facilities for children under five who have special social or healthneeds.I. training the amount of training for social workers,both in-service training and post-qualifyingstudies will be less than that recommended bythe Birch report on the Management andTraining of Social Workers unless moreresources arc available.J.  Offenders in ScotlandTreatment of adult offenders in Scotland is part of this programme. There is an acknow-ledged lack of community services for suchoffenders including non-custodial alternatives to imprisonment.12. The additional bids for Great Britain are summarised below.  million	1979	1980	1981	1982	-80	-81	-82	-83Welfare foods	2-2	2-2	2-3	2-4FPS demand	4-6	6-6	8-6	56-3FPS revaluation change	7-1	6-6	6-7	6-4H and CH current .	104-2	1821	222-3	352-3H and CH capital .	37-4	62-1	93-1	121-9LA PSS current	18-3	39-5	51-7	100-5LA PSS capital	8-4	8-2	17-6	29-5Centrally-financed services	4-3	8-4	9-4	10-3Total	186-5	315-7	411-7	679-6Offsetting savings13. The departments have already taken accountof a number of measures that might produce savingsduring the survey period, including reduction in management costs, in promulgating guidelines tothe health authorities (e.g. Appendix III of &quot;TheWay Forward&quot;. September 1977). In Englandadditional savings of about  100,000 per annumeach might result by the formation of single-districtfrom multidistrict Areas, and 8 such proposals are under consideration. However, in advance of thereport of the Royal Commission, the government cannot press such a policy beyond what authorities themselves bring forward. Furthermore a nationalpattern of single-district Areas would mean moreAreas and the same savings could not be assumed.Departments have also reduced forecast net expen-diture on family practitioner services to take accountof the savings in expenditure on drugs as part ofthe NHS contribution to the 1976 economy measures.Departments therefore take the view that the only way of substantially offsetting the additional expen-diture required would be by increasing the level of present charges (see paragraph 16 below) or intro-ducing new charges (e.g. visits to GPs. &quot;hotel&quot;charges) which will significantly change the presentsystem, and undermine the principles on which thehouldNHS is based.14.   In the Treasury&apos;s view new programmes sbe financed by savings or from cuts in expenditureof   lower priority.    As   regards   demands for additional resources these can only be justified mterms of a ranking of relative priorities sincepotential demands for expenditure on health a personal social services are virtually limitless. An-systematic assessment also requires in addition todemographic factor used to measure standsgenerally, a range of measures of client service outputs to help provide a sound basis for assessingclaims for new resources.   The Treasury arenotsatisfied that sufficient account has been taken ^the possibilities of greater economy in the use^eexisting  resources,  in  the   formulation ofadditional bids in paragraphs 6 to 12 above.Options for reductions15.   A reduction of 2\ per cent in expenditure onthe health and personal social services in iyiand later years implies cuts of:1979-801980-811981-82208211215if such cuts for 1982-83 were made from a starting point which excluded bids necessary because ofdemography they would imply a reduction of some4 per cent from the levels needed to maintain thosestandards. The health departments therefore consider that the demographic addition requiredfor 1982-83 should be incorporated in the surveyfigures before cuts are considered.126confidential
&apos;6- Even so. the departments believe the reduc-tions could only be achieved by drastic measures,deluding some that might be seen as contraryto the basic principles of the NHS. The scope for increasing dental and ophthalmic charges is restricted&apos;n the light of recent increases, so that almost all of the cuts would fall on services. ImportantPriorities for relatively deprived services for thernentally ill, the mentally handicapped and the elderly-would have to be postponed whilst services in the acute sector would be seriously restrictedwith consequent constraint on the treatment thateould be provided for individual patients.17 Possible measures that could be considered in circumstances where there was an overriding needlo reduce expenditure are shown in the table belowand explained briefly in the notes that follow. Itmust be emphasised however that none of these measures is recommended by departments.  million1979SO1980SI1981S2(a) Increased charges:0) Increased yield* from pre-scription charges from April1979 (maximum 50p) .(ii) Family planning items at halfprice from April 1979C&quot;) Cuts in services:Health capital/revenue .l^S capital/revenueWelfare milk ....Total .* Includes both the extra income from the charge, and the^imatcd saving from the deterrent effect of such increases.description chargesl8- The net cost of drugs prescribed in the NHScould, given subordinate legislation, be reduced by^creasing  the  present  20p  prescription charge49 0	490	47-97-1	71	71		7103-9	1060	109-442-8	43-6	4505-2	5-3	5-5208	211	215across the board; the additional yield from a chargeof 40p (less than the real value of the charge in1971) would be about  32 million; that from 50p,about  49 million. However, the Government hasnot so far been willing to take this step.Family planning items19. A cost-related charge for items supplied underthe family planning service could save  7 -1 million.However, if the charges led to no more than anincrease of about 7.000 unintended births a year the savings would disappear. Subordinate legislation would be required.Cuts in expenditure20. Departments would not propose to cut revenue expenditure below the minimum needed for demo-graphic change and advances in medical treatment.The balance would come from capital cuts whichwould have a severe effect on the health services.They would require a moratorium on all new capitalschemes, including health centre projects and innercity developments, and restricting capital expen-cliturc to the minimum required for maintenance andfor contractual obligations.21. In the personal social services, departmentsbelieve there would also be serious problems if localauthorities were required to reduce capital expen-diture as shown in the table. The provision of accommodation for the elderly, disabled andchildren already falls short of existing targets.Welfare milk22. A small saving could be made by withdrawingwelfare milk benefits from large young families notneeding it on income grounds and by withdrawingthe one third pint of milk per child per day providedfree for approved local authority and privateday nurseries, play groups and child minders.Subordinate legislation would be required.

Theprogramme figures and therefore critically depen-dent on. and indeed can only be calculated by reference to. the economic assumptions providedby the Treasury. Accordingly, there is a signifi-cant margin of error either way.Additional   requirements   to   maintain existingstandards3. There is a legislative commitment to increasenational insurance long-term and short-term bene-fits. Consolidated Fund benefits are similarlyincreased: it is normal practice for the scalerates of supplementary benefits to be increased at each uprating by the same cash amount asthe associated national insurance benefits.Although the Secretary of State is required to review the rate of child benefit annually, no pro-vision for uprating this benefit beyond theannounced changes in November 1978 and April1979 is included in the programme and a realdecline in value thereafter is assumed; similarly,a real decline has been assumed for national insurance death and maternity grants for whichthere is no legislative commitment to review.129
4. Child benefit was increased to  2-30 a week for all children in April 1978 and the premium forthe first child of a one-parent family doubled to 1. The increased cost was partly offset by areduction in child tax allowances (CTAs). Thebenefit is to be increased to  3 in November 1978;the premiums to  2; and in April 1979 childbenefit will be increased to  4 with the completephasing out of CTAs with the exception of those for certain students and children living overseas.These changes and the consequent adjustment of child dependency additions to benefit have been allowed for in the relevant projections in part 1 of table 12.The real improvement of benefits5. The following table shows the cost of the realimprovement in social security benefits after taking account of the new economic assumptions andestimating changes. The comparison is with thcaverage levels of benefit in force in 1978-79.  million					1979	1980	1981	1982	SO	SI	S2	S3Long-term benefits	205	394	594	798Short-term benefits	9	46	53	66Child benefit (net of CTA				change-over)	-126	-207	-279	-342Other benefits	-2	-4	-6	-8Total	86	229	362	5146. The following factors account for the total netreal improvement in benefits shown above. On the survey assumptions, the three upratings from november 1980 onwards will lead to improvements in the real value of long-term benefits, since earn-ings are expected to rise faster than prices. since there is no provision for uprating child benefit, thereal value falls as indicated; and a similar declineapplies to death and maternity grants. The esti-mating changes shown in part II of the table alsoreflect later forecasts of the numbers (other thanthe unemployed) expected to claim the variousbenefits.Proposals for additional expenditure. The following proposals are put forward for additional expenditure:(a) Supplementary benefit. From next november the difference between the long and short-termscale rates will be  4-35 for a single person and  6-30 for a married couple. The depart-ment consider that such a gap can no longer be justified for the long-term unemployed and for one-parent families who have to rely on short-term rates even though they havebeen on benefit for a long time. Accordingly&apos;amending Regulations arc proposed to enablethe long-term rates to be payable with effect from April 1979 to all those on supplementary benefit for more than one year at an annual cost of  79 million rising to  89 million by1982-83.(b) Disablement(i) Under present legislation mobility alloW&quot;ance may not be awarded after pension age and allowances awarded before thatage should be withdrawn. Withdrawalis considered politically unacceptable antherefore it is proposed that paymentsonce awarded should continue to bepaid at least to age 75.   Moreover, it l*also   proposed   that   women shouqualify for mobility allowance up to thesame age as men, ie age 65 (althougwomen&apos;s retirement age is 60). To avowithdrawals amending legislation wobe needed in the 1978-79 session.(ii) The Industrial Injuries Advisory Councilarc expected to recommend an extensionof   industrial   injuries   cover to additional   range   of   workers whoshearing is impaired through workingvery noisy processes.   This would c 2 million in 1979-80 rising to  6 mil&quot;0111982-83.(c) Family income  supplement.    Approval ijjprinciple   has   already   been   given toreduction from 30 to 24 in the part-time hou. on of work rule for one-parent families a ^estimated cost of  1^ million whenevernecessary resources become available. **ever, following pressure from the intersorganisations, the department now proPJthat from April 1979 lone parents should^eligible for family income supplement if 1work at least 20 hours a week.  The chan *wou&apos;0which can be made by Regulations,cost about  4 million a year.(d) Retirement pensions. The special non*contgnbutory retirement pension for people over130co
is at present subject to a 10-year residence testwhich must be satisfied before age 80. It isproposed to change the relevant regulations to enable the test to be satisfied after that age at an estimated annual cost of the order of   million.(e) Reciprocal agreement with Canada. TheCanadian Government is pressing for a fullreciprocal agreement which would involveimproving the pensions of United Kingdompensioners living in Canada which are currently frozen at the rate payable when the pensioner left the United Kingdom. It isproposed that from 1979 these pensionersshould receive the current United Kingdomrate provided that they are not receiving afull Canadian pension and that future UnitedKingdom pensioners in Canada should also receive the current United Kingdom rate.(/) Fortnightly payment of unemployment benefit.This bid by the Department of Employment isa consequence of a contribution to the civilservice cuts exercise (the effect of which hasalready been taken into account in the survey)and would provide for the payment of un-employment and supplementary benefits tothe unemployed fortnightly instead of weekly.As a result benefit expenditure will beincreased in the first year when fortnightlypayments are introduced since benefit willbe paid in advance and it is also expectedthat there will be a higher continuing level ofbenefit overpayments.Additional bids  million7979 7950 7957 7952-80     -81     -82 -83Pplementary benefit: exten-s&apos;on of long-term rate to allafter one year .Mobility allowance: age ex-tension ....Industrial injuries: extensionfor occupational deafness .Famiiy  income  supplement:reduction in full-time workrule.....0ver 80s&apos; retirement pension:residence testReciprocal agreement with canada :fortnightly payment of un-employment benefit .^ Total79 0 82 0 86 0 89 05 0 10 0 13 0 16 02-0     5 0      5-5      6 040	40	40	400-5	0-5	0-5	0-520	40	50	5 0160	20	20	20108-5   107-5   116-0 122-58. The social security programme provides forcash benefits which are demand-determined and accounts for well over 20 per cent of total public expenditure. Moreover, significant savings cannotbe secured on this programme. As is made clear in paragraph 3. the figures already provide forannual increases in the main long-term and short-term benefits in accordance with the statutorycommitments. Ministers have already approvedsubstantial improvements in the rate of childbenefit for implementation in November 1978 and april 1979 at an additional cost of  165 million in 1978-79 and  515 million in 1979-80. Theadditional bids included in the table above would add about an additional  110 million to expenditurein 1979-80 rising to about  125 million by 1982-83;and this would represent a permanent extension ofthe programme in addition to any further improve-ment that Ministers choose to make when taking decisions in the future on the annual upratings. Inthe Treasury view, however desirable the proposedimprovements may seem on merits, they are not essential requirements.Pressures for increases in expenditure. Child benefit. The rate of child benefit hasbeen fixed for April 1979 and no specific bid forthe future is being put forward. But until there isa specific Government commitment to increaseregularly the cash value of this benefit, which wouldbe reflected in the social security programme, the potential expenditure commitment is understated.10. Christmas bonus. Although DHSS do not give great priority to an additional payment at christmas to pensioners, etc. and therefore havenot put forward a bid in preference to those setout in the table above, there is now a publicexpectation that such a payment will be made thisyear and in subsequent years. A  10 bonus costsabout  100 million. Regular payments either byway of a bonus or an additional week&apos;s pension would result in a continuing increase of expenditurein the programme.11. Pearson Commission. Although no firm pro-posals for measures to be taken in response to thcPearson Commission recommendations are likely tobe formulated in time for consideration in thisCoNFlDENTIAL10695131r2
year&apos;s survey, it should be noted that the possibilityis currently being considered of devising a schemefor paying a loss of faculty benefit to severelydisabled people under pension age, whatever thecausation, as an alternative to the Pearson recom-mendations for paying such a benefit to severelyhandicapped children and to the victims of roadaccidents. The details of any such possible schemehave not yet been worked out. It would in any event be a possibility for the long term; even ifa decision to go ahead were taken next year, itwould probably be 1981 at thc earliest before a start could be made in phasing in such a scheme.By the end of the survey period, the cost could have risen to around  60 to  70 million a year on certain very provisional assumptions. Eventually,thc cost would be well over  100 million a year.(a) 3 per cent less than the present statutorycommitment on uprating benefits. i.e. long-term in line with earnings or prices whichever is the higher and short-term in line with prices. This would save  140 million in1979-80 and  370 million in a full year.(b) Abolition of earnings-related supplements to sickness and unemployment benefit about 200 million net in 1979-80, maternity grant 14 million in 1979-80 and death grant  &apos;5 million in 1979-80.Any attempt to make changes of this sort wouldbe highly controversial and would be unlikely tobe politically acceptable. The department do notconsider therefore that any of thc theoretical possi-bilities are in fact feasible.Options for reductions12. A reduction of 2\ per cent in the social securityprogramme for 1979-80 would require a saving of around  400 million. Since social security cxpen-diturc is almost entirely governed by legislation,savings of this magnitude could not be achieved without amending legislation. The sort of changesrequired would be:STAFF OF DHSS13. It is expected that between April 1978 and april 1983 the non-industrial staff of the depart-ment (including the central administrationof the health and personal social services) will risefrom93,300 to 94,600.   This increase will be requiredprimarily to deal with the growing work loads (orecast in connection with the administration of socisecurity benefits.

These shortfalls inPenditure could not have been foreseen. New*s and maintenance were affected by the generalOratorium of December 1976 and by other factors which inhibited forward planning in 1977. A con-tinuing small level of shortfall on parliamentaryaccommodation could however occur in all the survey years except 1980-81 and a small reductionof  0 1 million in those years has been accepted bythe Department of the Environment to provide more realistic figures.3. The level of expenditure on parliamentaryaccommodation during the survey period will maintain essential work for the provision andmaintenance of accommodation and services forthc Houses of Parliament, although a major airconditioning scheme has been deferred beyond1981-82 to allow priority for essential and over-due modernisation of the heating system in the palace of Westminster. Accommodation for broadcasting and the new Parliamentary telephoneexchange will come within this programme for1979-80 and 1980-81 and if any marginal extraprovision is needed for that it will be covered byoffsetting savings.c0nfidential133
Options for reductions4. Reductions of 2\ per cent on parliamentaryaccommodation would produce savings of  0 1 million in each year from 1979-80. Cuts of this level would have to be found by deferring and reducing maintenance expenditure, but this would reduce the operational efficiency of parliamentaryaccommodation services.Parliamentary election expenses5. The forecast covers only by-election expenditure and the replacement of election equipment. Itdoes not include the costs of the general electionwhich must take place not later than October 1979,or the cost of elections to the European Parliament.ECONOMIC AND FINANCIALADMINISTRATIONTax and rate collectionCUSTOMS AND EXCISEImplications of survey figures6. This expenditure consists almost entirely of pay and related administrative costs. economies which would lower existing planned standards riska serious loss of revenue, and damage to thedepartments control of revenue collection. the survey figures allow for minor changes in staffinglevels and in the overall volume of activities duringthe period.Options for reductions7. Sizeable economies in addition to the contri-bution towards the previously announced savingsand the action required to comply with the PrimeMinisters directive to offset growth could not beachieved without considerably greater loss ofrevenue and serious damage to Customs and excise,&apos;s capacity to collect revenue and exerciseimport and export controls. What follows aremeasures which would have to be adopted to achieve the 2\ per cent target. These measures were considered and rejected by Ministers in the context of the preparation of the 1976 proposals to reduce expenditure on the civil service.(i) Significant reductions in the standard of customs control of goods and passengersbelow a certain level could save  0-7 million a year.

Expenditure is for the following services note issue, debt management, exchange control andthe management of the exchange equalisationaccount. The level of service required is in eachcase largely determined by factors outside the Bank&apos;s immediate control. The cost of the work undertaken by the Bank does not fluctuate greatly from yearto year; a reduction of 2\ per cent would yieldabout  1$ million, but it has not been possible to identify any specific areas on which such a reductionmight fall.national land fund16.  4-2 million is included for payments from theNational Land Fund. There was underspending of 1-3 million in 1977-78 because of delays incompleting certain transactions. The timing ofexpenditure from the Fund is always uncertain. Itis proposed to maintain provision at the 1977-78level for the survey period.royal mint17. The programme now includes governmentfinancing of the Royal Mint instead of its capitalexpenditure.central management of the civilservice and royal commissionsImplications of survey figures18. This expenditure covers the managementfunctions of the Civil Service Department, royal commissions etc., government hospitality, and theOffice of the Parliamentary Counsel. The figuresenable existing policies to be maintained but thecontinued deferment of some planned developmentswill be necessary. At 1978 survey prices the outturnfor 1976-77 was  22-6 million compared withplanned expenditure of  25-3 million. This under-spend was substantially due to early implementation of the 1976 civil service economies exercise. For1977-78 the corresponding figures are  21 million and  21-8 million respectively, mainly due to a failure to achieve planned staff complements. Inview of new developments in the survey period which will have to be absorbed within the lower level of resources provided, it is not expected thatsignificant shortfall will recur.confidential135
Options for reductions19. A reduction of 2\ per cent would provide 0-5 million in each year from 1979-80. The mostfeasible single reduction of this order would be afurther retrenchment in the Civil Service College.RECORDS, REGISTRATIONS AND SURVEYS20. This includes expenditure by several govern-ment departments (the Office of Population Censusesand Surveys, the General Register Office (Scotland),Land Registry, Ordnance Survey, and other minordepartments) and some local authority expenditure.Provision is made under the Office of population censuses and Surveys (OPCS) for social surveyscarried out as an allied service for governmentdepartments.Implications of survey figures21. Shortfalls in the allocations for OPCS andthe General Register Office (GRO) (Scotland)for the years 1976-77 and 1977-78 amountedto  0-6 million and  0-3 million respectively.These resulted from under-recruitment and economy measures. The allocation in Cmnd.7049 for OPCS and GRO(S) includes provisionfor a 100 per cent census of the population in 1981 required by the Census Act 1920 and EECDirective (73/403/e.c.) of 22 November 1973.Agreed changes to Cmnd. 7049 reduce provision in 1978-79 for the 1981 census in England andWales and for census computer costs in 1979-80for GRO(S). Provision for OPCS in 1978-79 isfurther reduced in respect of social survey activity.Good housekeeping measures in 1979-80 and sub-sequent years result in reductions in manpower(57 staff) and general administrative expenditure.The new year provides for work on the 1981 census.The resulting baseline figures for the new survey are :  million	1978-79   1979-80 1980-81	1981-82	1982-83OPCS GRO(S) .	9-6       10-4 13-9 1-4         1-7 2-0	34-3 50	13-6 2-2of which	the following provision	is for	the 1981census:			  million	1978-79   1979-80 1980-81	1981-82	1982-83OPCS GRO(S) .	0-7         1-6 5-4 0-2         0-5 0-8	25-5 3-8	5-0 1022.

There is a minor requirement for additional expenditure for the Public Trustee Office to meetreduced income from charges.Devolution29. This programme covers the additional costs of devolution, i.e. the additional costs arising fromdevolution after allowing for reductions devolutionmakes possible in other public expenditure pro-grammes. For Scotland the baseline includes  1-9million for 1978-79; this covers only the cost of acquiring and adapting the Royal High School,Edinburgh, which it is intended should be ready for the Scottish Assembly by April 1979, and avery small amount of expenditure on office buildings.This expenditure will not constitute a net additionto the survey baseline since PSA have foundoffsetting savings in programme 14. For Wales theonly expenditure included in the baseline is  0-1 million for 1978-79 covering preliminary conversionand rent and maintenance of the Welsh Assemblybuilding. All other devolution expenditure, includ-ing additional staff costs, the costs of holdingreferenda and elections, will, if necessary, be treatedas claims on the contingency reserve. It is currentlyestimated that the potential claim on the contingency reserve is about  5 million in 1978-79 and about 10 million in 1979-80.Welsh Office administration30. There is an additional bid of  0-5 million in1979-80. Half of the manpower reductions for the welsh Office agreed as a contribution to the cut incivil service staff have been postponed until 1980-81so that implementation will not adversely affect theGovernments plans for devolution. No offsetting savings are identified.Confidential137

The outturn in 1976-77 was about  19 million or 5 per cent below the expenditure planned at thebeginning of the year and that in 1977-78 about 10-4 million or 3-1 per cent above. The shortfall in 1976-77 was almost all on rents, and much ofit was due to reversal in the House of Lords of earlier court decisions which would have obligedPSA to make additional payment of rents. In1977-78 PSA took over from Rating of Govern-ment Property Department responsibility forsome payments to water authorities. Theseextra costs, and over-estimation of receipts from the National Insurance Fund, were partly offset by increased sales of property and bya shortfall on new works resulting mainly fromdifficulty in estimating the effect of the moratoriumon new starts.Implications of survey figures2.   The total for 1978-79 is below Cmnd. 7049, ^those for 1979-80, 1980-81 and 1981-82 are neor at previous level; it has however been necesto offset reductions in some areas against increelsewhere.

Apart from an increase in 1978-79from the construction industry package, maintenance and running costs remain at  95 million1979-80 onwards despite a 1$ per cent increase inthe area of the estate.3. Rents now rise from just under  123 million nj1977-78 to  127 million in 1979-80 and then fcflto  122 million in 1982-83 due to replacement ofleased accommodation by owned accommodation-

Thisk*s been criticised from time to time in reports of^rliamcntary Committees.- Under present expenditure plans, the proportion0* owned property should rise to 42 per cent in1979 and about 45 per cent by 1982, provided that^ere is no increase in the size of thc civil service,^lus will be achieved, because the PSA regard it asan Important objective of their management of theProgramme so to operate and maintain the estate^ to enable the maximum amount within the^location available for the sub-programme to beUscd for this purpose.

A 2\ per cent reduction on this programme would amount to about  8-7 million a year. Inthe PSA&apos;s view, in 1979-80 the  5 million allocated for purchasing could, if necessary, be foregone andother smaller cuts made on building projects,furniture, minor works and maintenance. In later years the main weight of any cut would fall on thebuilding programme. Further restrictions on theamount of money still left in the programme forreplacing leased accommodation would have the opposite effect to the proposed increase in investment in new building and purchasing. Reductions inminor works and maintenance programmes wouldbe at the expense of acceptable standards.9. In thc Treasury&apos;s view, it should be possible toprotect construction expenditure to some extent by seeking further marginal savings in furniture and inmaintenance and running expenditure.Stationery and printing (home)10. Departmental demands for HMSO services have remained over the past year at the low levelexperienced in 1976-77, partly because departments have been pressed to restrict their demands uponHMSO in the interests of economy and to enableHMSO to keep within its cash limit. The level ofexpenditure in 1978-79 has been reduced by  10million compared with Cmnd. 7049. In the follow-ing years, on the assumption that continuing effortswill ensure that the use of HMSO&apos;s supplies and services remains at the minimum level consistent with departments&apos; necessary requirements, HMSOhas accepted reductions, which arc included in thebaseline, as shown below. Options for further reductions of 2\ per cent would mean askingdepartments to accept a lower quality service.

Computers and telecommunicationsImplications of survey figures11. At 1978 survey prices, the net outturn for1976-77 was  43-2 million compared with plannedexpenditure of  43-3 million and in 1977-78  53-5 million compared with  51-7 million.12. The survey figures allow no general provisionfor extending computing to new areas of governmentadministration; this arises from the exclusion of all such provision in the 1977 survey allocation, apartfrom certain committed items. In the view of theCivil Service Department the survey figures also make inadequate provision for the replacement ofexisting computer systems following re-sizing andreassessment since the 1977 survey, and any defer-ments of replacements would put important govern-ment computer operations at risk. There is also intheir view insufficient provision in 1981-82 for capital for shared telecommunications facilities fordispersal offices on Merseyside (this capital isrecoverable in later years through rentals met fromother programmes).Additional bids13. The following additional bids have been madeby the Civil Service Department:  millionmo-811981-821982-83(a) revised estimate of replacementcosts.....5-3(o) revised estimate for tclccom-munications ....(c) new applications for computersTotal    .... 9121 -- 0-7 -3-8       5-8 19-78-619-7Line (c) would in the view of the CSD provide forall known cost-effective new computer applicationsand some other large projects which appear tothem to be fully justified by policy and legalrequirements. No offsetting savings can be identifiedfor the reasons given above.14. The Treasury have discussed the detailedcontent of these bids with the department. Thefigures for the last two years include provision forcertain substantial projects (notably Inland RevenuePAYE assessment and some DHSS schemes) onwhich policy decisions have yet to be taken andto which considerable uncertainty attaches at thisstage as to their timing, or even their starting withinthe survey period.15. The Treasury note that if these projects were excluded and a steady level of provision made iQtthe most cost-effective and the most essential othe new applications for computers, the proposeaddition for this category might be expressed as abid for around  4 million a year from 1980-81onwards.

Even if it werePoetical to change the scheme to provide lesser^nefits, the reductions could apply only to thosewho retire in future and the bulk of the expenditurein the survey period arises from payments to people who have already retired or who will have reservedrights to existing benefits.21. In this programme, 1978 survey prices areconventionally assumed to continue throughout theperiod and no provision has been made for futureuprating of pensions. While, therefore, a decisionto increase pensions by less than the rate of inflationwould bring about a reduction in expenditure in cash terms, the saving could not be scored as areduction in the constant price figures shown.Other common services22. The Treasury Solicitor anticipates that theprovision made to meet the cost of providing legalservices for other government departments will be insufficient to meet the cost of the Crown Agentsinquiry. The cost of this inquiry is impossible toquantify with any accuracy at this stage. The best estimate that can be made is that an additional 0-2 million will be required in 1979-80 and therewill be further expenditure in 1980-81.

Examination of the outturn figures for 1976-77and the provisional outturn for 1977-78 in com-parison to the relevant survey report forecast shows a gross shortfall compared with original spendingplans of the order of  170 million and  113 million respectively for these years. The major areas ofshortfall in both years were in the trade, industryand employment, fuel, housing and law, order andprotective services programmes. The main reasonswere as follows:(i) lower than anticipated expenditure in indus-trial development because of the UK recessionand Northern Ireland&apos;s image overseas;(ii) slippage in capital expenditure on the Kilrootpower station and in addition, in 1977-78,a reduction in government lending to theNorthern Ireland Electricity Service;(iii) a slowing down in the construction of newdwellings as the emphasis in the housing programme shifted towards rehabilitation; and(iv) slippage in the programmes for prisons and police buildings and failure to achieve prisonofficer recruitment targets.There was general underspending in the education and libraries, science and arts programme in 1976-&apos;particularly on capital works.2. The gross amounts of shortfall were reducedthrough the absorption within programme 15 aSwhole of new expenditures of  48 million in 1976-and  68 million in 1977-78, plus a surrender o 3 million to the contingency reserve in 1977-leaving the net shortfall figures at  122 million a&quot; 42 million (provisional) respectively.  For 1978-there are proposals for further reallocationsexpenditure to allow on the one hand for a continuumlower demand for financial assistance towards inco03ing investment and on the other for continuesmeasures to maintain employment, for exampleagriculture and in temporary public sector schemccombining training with the creation of work.Implications of survey figures3. Some  17 million has been reallocated in 1978-&quot;79 with the aim of creating or maintaining emP^ment and special efforts are being made to dt **jmore resources towards areas of special social neparticularly in Inner and West Belfast.

This wouldnot be feasible and consequently, if option cuts hadto be made in the Northern Ireland programme, theywould have to be taken entirely from social, environ-mental and economic expenditure programmes. Theabove table takes account of this. The effect of taking up the illustrative option cut on a sample of services would be :(a) a cessation to job creation initiatives an-nounccd in recent months;(b) a need for average rent increases of some 0 - 60p per week higher than increases in GreatBritain or a reduction from an average of 75per cent to 50 per cent in the level of private sector house renovation grants;(c) a reduction of about 600 in the number of direct industrial training places; and(d) the loss of a major proportion of the growth rate for health and personal social services.Any options for reductions in expenditure by MAFFwill fall to be determined in the light of agricultural policy for the United Kingdom as a whole.7. It is not envisaged that the taking of optionswould require legislation, except as regards thereduction in the rate of house renovation grants,although the Northern Ireland situation would depend to some extent on that in Great Britain.

Totals and components have beenfunded separately.  Figures rounded to the nearest  0.1 million are shown in tables A7 and A8.The table shows a broadly similar pictureWhichever of  the  various  definitions  of totalf*Penditure is considered.   The very rapid growth,Q local authority expenditure in the first three^ears covered by the survey, which reached almostPer cent in 1974-75. was brought to an abrupterid in 1975-77 and resumed at the much morej^est rate of around 1 per cent in 1977-78. The8Ures shown in the table for 1978-79. both in total*nd for each individual programme, are thosesumed by the RSG settlements, as amended bye last Budget.  In England and Wales this implies0vvth in expenditure of about 1^ per cent. Forr years thc baseline provides for growth rates alittle below 1 per cent in 1979-80 and 1981-82 anda little above in 1980-81 (survey definitions). InScotland there is a small reduction in local authoritycurrent expenditure in 1978-79 on survey definitions(which virtually disappears on RSG definitions) andthere is very little growth in the baseline figures for later years. Total expenditure is only  - per cent higher in 1982-83 than in 1978-79.3. In England and Wales the recently receivedDOE/CIPFA returns of expenditure and ratessuggest that local authorities are in total budgetingto spend around  200 million (2 per cent) more thanthe provision in volume terms.  But the experience50NFIDENTIAL145T
Supplementary Analysis of the last two years has been that these returnshave significantly overstated actual spending levels.In 1976-77, when Government action was taken to cut back expenditure after receipt of the returns,the margin of difference was as much as  500million (5 per cent). In 1977-78 the present esti-mate suggests that the margin is likely to be at least 200 million (2 per cent) and may prove to be rather higher when final outturn figures are avail-able in September.4. In assessing the prospects for 1978-79 it couldbe misleading to place too much weight on thisrelatively limited experience, particularly since it covers a period when the general economic climatewas rather different from what it is now. But thereare a number of a priori reasons for expectinglocal authorities to continue to budget for morethan they will actually spend and the general viewof the Departments responsible for the main localauthority services, reached after discussion withthe local authority associations, is that, unless some-thing unexpected happens during the course of theyear, expenditure in total is likely to turn out to be close to the survey provision. No allowance has there fore been made at present for an overspend on local authority current expenditure in 1978-79 as a claim on the contingency reserve.5. A potentially more difficult problem is posed bythe service breakdown of the local authorities&apos;budget estimates. The budgeted overspend is concentrated on local environmental services, trans-port and personal social services with a slight under-spend planned for education. It would be consistent with the view taken about the total, and with past experience, to expect the outturn for the year toshow lower figures for all services, reducing oreliminating some of the overspends and increasingthe underspend on education. The precise impli-cations of the budget estimates are being looked at by the RSG sub-groups, who will be preparingrevised forecasts of the 1978-79 outturn for their services for the Consultative Council meeting inJuly, and again in September by when near finaloutturn figures for 1977-78 should be available.6. This is not a new problem. In 1977-78 present estimates suggest that local authorities spentsome  100 million (or 1 per cent) less thanprovided for in the RSG settlement. Within thisreduced total they spent around  130 million (or  per cent) less on education and around  55million (or 6 per cent) less on local transport.7. Given the limited degree of influence which theGovernment can exercise over the distribution oflocal authority current expenditure it is not neces-sarily surprising or reprehensible if the sum of thedecisions of individual authorities on the distributionbetween services differs somewhat from the alloca-tion shown in public expenditure surveys. Thediscrepancies for 1978-79, however, appear to be particularly striking and to have implications fofthe forward years of the survey. If this is confirmedwhen revised estimates for 1977-78 and 1978-79become available in the autumn, the distributionshown in the present survey figures should be adjusted. It will be for consideration then whether these changes should be handled on a functionalbasis in the same way as other additional bids affect-ing baseline figures for individual programmes. orwhether they should be dealt with separately astechnical adjustments within the total of locaauthority current expenditure for England anWales.8. In  Scotland, the local  authorities&apos;  1978-79budget estimates show that they are planning 10spend  about   30 million  (2\ per cent) morethan the provision made.   The intended overspending is concentrated on local environmenservices  and  education.    The  figures  are sbeing discussed with the Convention of ScottjLocal   Authorities   (COSLA)   and  the scottish office are hopeful that some of the overspenwill prove to be due to technical deficienciesthe returns and that in the light of experience in previous years, most, if not all, of the remaincan be discounted on the grounds of realism.Additional bids9.

Thereare also bids of  11 million in 1980-81rising to  52 million in 1982-83 for additional expenditure on the urban programme someof which would, if agreed by Ministers, fallon other programmes. (The balance of theadditional bids for the urban programmementioned in the programme chapter affectscapital expenditure.)(&apos;v) the largest of the additional bids on thelaw, order and protective services programme is accounted for by the Home Office&apos;estimate of the cost of additional recruitment of policemen arising from an anticipatedimprovement in their pay and conditions asa result of the Edmund-Davies Report.(v) of the additional bids for education, around 100 million in each year is related to thebudget decisions on school meals and milk.A further  2 million in 1980-81 rising to 70 million in 1982-83 is, in the view ofCoNFlDENTIALthe Department, required to maintain existingstandards in local authority further educationestablishments. Most of the remainder ofthe bids are for new developments, of which by far the largest is in respect of awards for16 to 18 year olds.(vi) the additional bids for personal social services are required, in the view of the Departmentto improve the existing levels of provision and. as far as 1982-83 is concerned, forsome additional demographic element.11. In considering the prospects, and the additionalbids, for individual local authority services, it isnecessary to assess at the same time the realism ofthe totals for local authority current expenditure.Could local authorities be persuaded to spend in total at the planned level; and what action would the Government need to take to persuade them todo so?12. Recent experience appears to be that in both1976-77 and 1977-78 local authority current expenditure was very close to the provision madein Government plans and, as indicated in paragraph4. it may be that the outturn in 1978-79 will alsobe close to the target (in total, if not for each ofthe individual services).13. The credit for this notable achievement mustbe shared between local authorities and theGovernment. Local authorities have recognised the national importance of the level of their current expenditure, which accounts for around one-fifth of total public spending; and they have respondedwell to the appeals made, and the actions taken,by the Government. The Government, for its part,has been able to show that the national economicsituation required restraint; that comparable re-straint was being exercised over its own spendingand over that elsewhere in the public sector; andthat the rate support grant settlements, howevertough they may have seemed, did not require large increases (on average) in rate poundages.14. What was achieved was a fairly stable level ofexpenditure from 1975-76 to 1977-78, which is now expected to be followed by an increase approaching2 per cent in 1978-79. The question is whether itis realistic to assume that this rate of growth cannow be reduced, as the baseline figures imply, to less than 1 per cent in 1979-80 and to continue at about this rate in 1980-81 and 1981-82 (survey147
definitions). No growth at all has yet been pro-vided for 1982-83. On RSG definitions, the growthrates will look slightly smaller.15. In the view of the departments with respon-sibilities for local authority services, the general attitude taken by Ministers towards public expenditure as a whole will be a most important consideration. Moreover, local authorities are aware that there has been an improvement in thegeneral financial climate; there are strong pressuresfor higher levels of expenditure in some services;and some authorities have already been com-plaining that local government is not being givenits fair share of the overall increase in public expenditure of around 2 per cent which was announced in Cmnd. 7049. It seems unlikelytherefore that the Government could persuade localauthorities to accept a rate of growth in their total current expenditure in 1979-80 significantlybelow 2 per cent. This would require additional provision of about  140 million and, if the presentbaseline growth rates were maintained for 1980-81onwards, additions of  140 million in each of thoseyears also.16. The Departments concerned have moremixed views about the prospects for 1980-81onwards. On the one hand, it is argued that thisis too far ahead for any firm conclusions to bedrawn; and that the continued reluctance of authorities to make large increases in ratepoundages may enable the Government to control the situation through its determination of the levelof rate support grant. On the other hand, it isargued that the reasons for expecting a rate of growth of around 2 per cent in 1978-79 and1979-80 will continue to operate; and that actionsalready taken by the Government on public expenditure generally and, for example, oninitiatiyes in inner cities, may tend towards a higher rate of growth in subsequent years. By way ofillustration, if a growth rate of 2 per cent a year were maintained after 1979-80, this would require futher provision (in addition to that mentioned inthe previous paragraph) of around  110 million in 1980-81,  260 million in 1981-82 and  500million in 1982-83.17. Very similar considerations affect the realismof the baseline figures for Scotland, where theSecretary of State allocated some additional provision to local authority current expenditure for1481978-79, and the planned figures for subsequent years show an even lower rate of growth than inEngland and Wales. The additional amounts overand above the baseline required to produce a 2 pefcent growth path would be  28 million in 1979-80. 53 million in 1980-81.  72 million in 1981-82 and 99 million in 1982-83.The financing of rate fund expenditure18. Table A3 shows estimates of local authorityrevenue expenditure at outturn prices and the way in which it was financed from 1973-74 to 1977-78,and how it is expected to be financed in 1978-79-19.

In England and Wales a distinction is made between key sector projects, which are subject to specific departmental approval, and the locally determined sector, within which local authoritiesare free to set their own priorities.   Key sector expenditure in total is now planned to increase b)around 11$ per cent in 1978-79 compared wit11latest estimates of outturn in 1977-78, rises by further 2 per cent in 1979-80 and is then held aroughly the same level over the next three ycaTS150CONFID
% the end of the period, total expenditure is equivalent to around two thirds of the level itreached in the peak year of 1974-75. The provisionfor the locally determined sector, which was sub-stantially overspent in 1977-78, falls by 25 per centin 1978-79 and by a further 6J per cent in 1979-80and then returns to roughly its 1978-79 level in the&apos;ast three years.In Scotland, where no distinction is made between key and locally determined expenditure,the baseline figures in total provide for broadstability throughout the survey period.2s- Housing accounts for nearly two-thirds ofthese totals and provides what buoyancy there is inthe baseline figure for future years. The estimates for other programmes-whose capital expenditurecan have significant consequences for the rate of growth of local authority current expenditure-imply some reduction after 1978-79, as Table A5shows.Local authority capital expenditure on housing table A5   million at 1978 survey prices1974 1977 1978 1979 1980 1981-75 -78 -79 -80 -81 -82housing:England and Wales 3,250 1,730 1,930 2,065 2,085 2,090Scotland     .      .    300 215 205 230 250 250Other programmes:England and Wales 2,025 1,335 1,280 1.170 1,190 1,185Scotland     . 350    295    325    320    310 30526.

Supplementary Analysis D CONFIDENTIALD.   Expenditure on devolved services and its financing1. This supplementary analysis of devolved and english equivalent expenditure is presented on theassumption that following affirmative referendumvotes, devolution in Scotland will be effective from1 October 1979 and in Wales from 1 April 1980.As explained in the White Paper on &quot; Devolution:Financing the Devolved Services&quot; (Cmnd. 6890),under the Governments devolution proposals theScottish and Welsh administrations will become responsible for determining expenditure priorities ondevolved services. Table 1 below provides assess-ments of devolved expenditure included in the survey baseline, together with the English equivalent,reflecting the Governments present policies for these programmes.2. After devolution the Government will determinein discussions with the Scottish and Welsh admin-istrations. aggregate totals for devolved expenditure.This expenditure will be financed in part by blockfunds from Government Votes, in part by borrowingand in part by local contributions from rates. the block funds and the limits on capital expenditurefinanced by borrowing will be presented to Parlia-ment in the form of draft orders subject to affirmative resolutions.3. Table 2 uses historical data to show how&apos;expenditure on these programmes was financed mthe years 1973-74 to 1977-78 and shows how it *expected to be financed in 1978-79. On the assump-tion that the devolved administrations would have adopted the same expenditure priorities as thepresent Government and that thc same patterns of financing would have applied illustrative figures are provided of the amounts the Government wouldhave paid into the block funds and of thc aggregateborrowing limits. These are order of magnitudefigures only at this stage and further work onrefining them will continue.4. On this basis it is estimated that if the proposedsystem had been in operation in 1978-79 the blockfund for Scotland would have amounted to about 2.550 million and the block fund for Wales toabout  1,225 million.

Supplementary Analysis ECONFIDENTIALE.  The Construction industry. Table 1 shows the path of output for the maintypes of construction work since 1970-71. total output of the industry fell in four successive yearsafter 1972-73; and by 1976-77 it had fallen by 21per cent. During this period, there was a markeddecline in all types of construction work other thanpublic housing. The industry&apos;s manpower (includingthe self-employed) did not fall as fast. Thus, in1976-77 it averaged 1-68 million, which was about300,000, or 15 per cent lower than in 1972-73. Asizeable fall in output per head is implied by theserelative movements.2. In 1977-78, there appears to have been a slightrecovery with total output estimated at 2 per centup on 1976-77. New house-building, particularlyin the public sector, was lower. In the public sector this was partly due to the over-reaction tocash limit constraints: in the private sector reduceddemand caused by previous decreases in purchasingpower and high mortgage rates, coupled with thecost of new house-building and consequent lowlevels of return to contractors, contributed to thelow figures. Public non-housing work also declinedduring the year as the July and December 1976measures took effect. However, private industrialwork (factories etc.) showed a significant increase on 1976-77 and there was a modest increase for private commercial new work. Repair and main-tenance work, which accounts for one-third of totalconstruction activity, has also risen.3. In the second half of 1977 there were indications that margins on tender prices were easing. these had been very tight in 1976 and early 1977.4. Construction manpower fell by 50,000 between january and October 1977 when manpower was estimated to be 1,610,000. As output was risingthroueh the year there was a sharp rise in output per head to take the level of output per man tolevels last achieved in mid-1974.5. Unemployment in February 1978 was 205,000,having been little changed since February 1976.Unemployment amongst craftsmen, which reached a peak of about 65,000 early in 1977, had fallen to61.000 in the first quarter of 1978 and there was afurther sharp reduction in April to 55,000.The Short Term Outlook6. Output in the first quarter of 1978 is likely toshow some reduction from the levels of the second half of last year because of the exceptionally severewinter weather. Thereafter, a sustained but slowrecovery in activity is expected. Output in 1978-79is expected to be nearly 4 per cent up on 1977-78and a further increase of about 3 per cent is expected in 1979-80. Of the new construction categories,private house-building is expected to rise quitebriskly in 1978-79 as rising building societyadvances and house prices stimulate demand, while in 1979-80 a further but more modest increase moutput is expected. The decline in public sectornew house-building is expected to continue until theend of 1978-79 and then increase slightly in 1979-80-Public new works output, which probably declinedby nearly H per cent between 1976-77 and 1977-78.is expected to remain at this lower level through1978-79 and to increase in 1979-80 by about 3 percent. These projections, like those for public house-building, are based on thc survey baseline figures shown in Table 2.7. Demand for private non-housing work is closely related to the level of investment in privatemanufacturing and distributive and service indus-tries. The forecasts for these imply a further risein output in 1978-79 for private industrial and private commercial new work, of 11 per cent and per cent respectively. These increases are eon-sistent with the recent path of contractors&apos; new&quot;orders. For 1979-80 the position is less clear buta further small increase in activity in these sectorsappears likely.8. Total repair and maintenance work is expectedto be rather more buoyant than new work overthe next 2 years.   The survey baseline projectionsimply substantial increases in improvement arepairs and maintenance work for public housingfrom 1977-78 to 1979-80.   Local authorities have some discretion as to how they allocate funbetween new work and repairs and maintenance sothat the split between new work and repairs amaintenance work should be regarded as tentative-Private housing repair and maintenance, Pa
dependent on local authority improvement grants,is expected to increase only slowly up to 1979-80.Non-housing repair maintenance work in both thePublic and private sectors is expected to increase.9- Projections of future manpower levels in con-struction arc difficult to make after a period of falling output per head. 1977 saw a reversal ofthis trend. If output per man were to remain atthe average of the level in the second half of 1977then an increase in employment of about 100,000could be expected over the next 2 years. allowing for an increase in output per head of 1^ per cent per annum implies an increase in employment ofabout 60,000 over the next 2 years and a reductionQf unemployment of about 50,000.The Medium Term Prospect: 1980-81 and beyond10. Output projections for public sector activityshown in Table 1 rely on the survey baselineProjections. No allowance for shortfall has beenmade in these projections. For private sectorProjections it is assumed that GDP grows at 3  percent a year.11. For the years between 1979-80 and 1982-83output of new dwellings is projected to grow on average by about 3J per cent per annum. Thisgrowth is entirely accounted for by expansion inthe private sector where output is expected to expand by about 6\ per cent per annum. Howevereven in 1982-83 private housing output would beabout 15 per cent less than the levels achieved inthe peak years of 1972-73 and 1973-74. On theassumption that there is little change from thecurrent average size and quality of houses throughthe survey period, the projections imply a level of housing completions of between 140,000 and 150,000in 1982-83 in the public sector and 180-200,000 inthe private sector. This compares with figures for,977 of 160.000 in the public sector and 140,000lri the private sector. The projections for housingrePair and maintenance work including improve-ments work is for a rather slow growth between1979-80 and 1982-83 of perhaps 1  per cent a year.This allows for quite a brisk rise in output ofprivate repair and maintenance work but staticpublic repair and maintenance and improvementwork and private improvement work.12. The survey baseline figures imply that outputof public works, which includes nationalised indus-tries&apos; expenditure on new construction, will remainbetween 1979-80 and 1982-83 at a level of some 7 billion a year-slightly above that in 1977-78.Little significant change is expected in the allocation of work in the medium term. The miscellaneouscategory, which includes some defence expenditure,and health and personal social services programmeshow slight increases while the road and transportprogramme shows a decrease. Fuller details of thenew construction programmes implied by the base-line figures are shown in table 2.13. The proposals for additional expenditure putforward by Departments have a relatively lowconstruction content. Taking those items where ithas been possible to make some quantification ofthat content, the total is of the order of 15 per cent.14. In 1979-80, after 2 years of rapid growth,private industrial and commercial new constructionincreases only slightly. Thereafter a modestexpansion of 3-4 per cent per annum is likely.Repair and maintenance work is expected to growin line with new work.15. By 1982-83 the projections suggest that totalconstruction output will be about 12 per cent abovethe level of 1977-78, an average growth of 2\ percent per annum. New construction work may increase more slowly than this; repair and main-tenance a little faster. Those projections dependcritically on the assumption that GDP will growby 3  per cent a year, and they assume that public sector demand on the construction industry willremain broadly stable after 1979-80. Growth will therefore depend on the demand for housing and investment by the private sector.Confidential163

F.  Employment and training measures1- Since 1975-76 a series of temporary measures and some longer term schemes have been introducedlo mitigate the worst effects of high unemployment,especially for hard-hit groups such as young people.The aims are to maintain and improve the level oftraining, particularly in skilled trades; to providerecruitment subsidies; to give unemployed peopletemporary jobs  and  work experience;  and toencourage workers to retire early to provide employ-ment opportunities. The resources made availableto the various schemes are shown in the attachedtable.2.

G.   The Urban ProgrammeENGLAND AND wales. The urban programme is being recast with full effect from 1979-80 to cover economic and environ-mental as well as social projects and the resources available to it have been increased as part of theGovernment^ policy for the inner city areas.Responsibility for the urban programme hasbeen transferred from the Home Office to theDepartment of the Environment and the welsh office.2. Under the new policy in England, seven partner-ships have been entered into with nineteen localauthorities, fifteen authorities have been madeprogramme authorities, and a further fourteendistricts and London boroughs are, along withthe partnership and programme authorities, tobe designated under the Inner Urban AreasBill as areas which are to have increasedpowers to assist the regeneration of industry.A number of authorities in Wales, five initially,will be designated under the Bill and will be accorded special attention and a measure of priority for allocations within the overall urbanaid programme.3. The resources available under the expandedurban programme, including the inner citiesconstruction package announced in the 1977Budget, are summarised in tables 1 and 2.Although the main provision is at present heldwithin programme 8 (other environmental services), it is intended that resources shouldbe allocated between programmes according tothe service distribution of the expenditureauthorised under the urban programme. As a first step, the construction package for 1977-78and 1978-79 has been allocated to functionalprogrammes on the basis of the projectsaccounting for the full amount of the packagewhich have now been approved. The servicemix of the programme may of course changein subsequent years and patterns of actual expenditure will not correspond exactly withthe present allocations between survey programmes.4. For 1980-81 and later years, the DOEand Welsh Office maintain that further provision will be needed in order to ensure that a constant rate of new resources becomes avail-able for new projects each year. Additionalbids have been submitted under programme 8although any additional resources would ofcourse be available for use in other services which the urban programme.5. The injection of resources into the urban programme for construction work in inner cityareas in 1977-78 and 1978-79 has been reflected in an emphasis on capital expenditure for thoseyears. Partnership authorities have been advised to aim at a 3:1 capital: current expendituresplit for 1978-79 (excluding the constructionpackage), but in future years the split may be rathernearer 2:1.6. There has been considerable slippage jnexpenditure under the construction package forinner cities. In consequence, the constructionpackage resources of  80-9 million for Englandare not now expected to be fully utilised beforethe end of 1978-79. It is estimated that some 64-9 million will be spent by that date andthe balance of  16 million is the subject of anadditional bid for 1979-80. (The figures intable 1 reflect shortfall of  5-4 million on theCmnd. 7049 estimate of expenditure in1977-78,but not the underspending of  10-6 million now expected in 1978-79.)7. Programmes were approved for constructionpackage authorities during 1977-78 and work isunder   way   on   a   wide   variety   of projects-They  include  the  rehabilitation  and improve&quot;ment of old housing (both public and private sector), industrial site preparation, the building of    advance    factories,    school improvement,community buildings, day centres, health facilityrecreational   facilities   and   the   reclamation ^derelict and neglected land.    On the basis the approvals given, 31  per cent of the cofl^struction package resources in England willallocated to industrial projects, 21 per centhousing,  17 per cent to transport, 9 pcr cto recreation, 8 per cent to education, 4cent to social services, 3 per cent to health a
7 per cent to various other services. This shouldnot, however be taken as a guide to the eventualbreakdown of resources under the main urban programme, which will have both capital and current expenditure components.8. Provisional allocations from the enlargedurban programme for 1979-80 to 1981-82 havebeen made to the partnership and programmeauthorities who are currently producing their first plans covering the whole three year period.Partnerships have been allocated on averagearound  10 million a year and programmeauthorities have between  1 million and  million a year each. The plans will be avail-able later this year and will provide the basis for decisions on the detailed service allocationQf resources available under the urban pro-gramme in this period.9. Experience of the 1978-79 urban programme&apos;n partnership areas (where the range of pro-jects has already been widened) suggests thatth-e expanded programme will support the follow-&apos;ng kinds of activity:Industrial provision acquisition of sites, sitepreparation, construction of advance factories,conversion of old premises.Transport improved access to industrial sites and more generally to industrial areas.Environmental improvements landscaping ofneglected sites, removal of eyesores, tree planting.Sport and recreation youth club buildings and leaders, play areas, provision of equip-ment, new allotments.Education nursery school facilities and staff,improvements to old classrooms, and play-grounds, extension of facilities for sport, homevisitors.Personal social services extensions to homes,day care facilities and luncheon clubs for the elderly; day nurseries for children; hostels for single homeless; and day care facilities for the mentally disordered.Health premises for new group practices.For the community provision for communitycentres, promotion of good neighbours schemes.In addition to getting direct help under the urban programme local authorities are expectedthemselves to give a preference to their inner urbanCONFIDENTIALareas. Government departments are also expectedto introduce an inner cities dimension into their service programmes and an interdepartmentalworking group is considering ways in which this canbe done. The current position on the various main programmes is summarised in the following paragraphs.Transport11. Local authorities have been told that theSecretary of State for Transport expects their transport policies and programme (TPPs) to havean inner area dimension. i.e. to include projects tohelp their inner areas, and that he will take accountof these projects in determining the distributionamong countries of expenditure accepted for transport Supplementary Grant (TSG). But it is too early to say what proposals local authorities will be making.Local environmental services12. The bulk of local environmental servicescapital expenditure is within the locally determinedsector and is therefore at the discretion of localauthorities. The sharp reduction in the locally determined sector borrowing allocation for 1978-79left no margin for weighting the borrowing allo-cation in favour of inner urban areas and thc localauthority associations refused to co-operate in anysuch weighting. However, local authorities were asked whenever possible to pay particular attentionto the special needs of areas of urban decline andand deprivation in deciding their expenditure programmes. Priority is given to inner cityschemes in the derelict land programme and thiswill increase with the designation of innerBirmingham and London Docklands as derelict landclearance areas where 100 per cent grants will beavailable. Local authorities have been advised that community land projects in inner cities will beconsidered favourably wherever possible and inaddition community land resources may be usedto finance development in those areas.Health services13. The 1978 planning guidelines issued by DHSSto all health authorities and copied to localauthorities, emphasised the priority to be attachedto catering for the needs of inner city areas, and tothe special needs for social care and support insuch communities with significant ethnic minority169
populations. This includes the development of adequate primary health care facilities andespecially the provision of out-of-hours medical services. The guidelines also emphasised the con-tinuing importance for health authorities to securearrangements for effective joint care planningacross the full range of local services, with localauthorities, education authorities and transport authorities.Family practitioner services14. The funds required by health authorities tomake payments for the family practitioner services(general medical services, general dental services,general ophthalmic services and pharmaceuticalservices) are provided as required to meet payments due.Hospital and community health services15. The available capital and revenue funds arcallocated by Department of Health and social security to Regional Health Authorities havingregard to the relative health care needs of thepopulation served. Similar considerations apply toallocations within regions. To the extent that theproblems of inner cities affect health, this is reflected in thc allocation arrangements. In addition, until a further distribution of resources is achievedjudgements about the extent and pace of changehave to take account of local factors, including theproblems of providing health care in inner cityareas. In particular, the distribution of thc capitalsums to be spent by health authorities on theprovision of health centres and other primary carepremises is heavily weighted in favour of the inner city partnership and programme areas, as isthe part of the additional funds allocated to health authorities following the April 1978 Budget for personal social services projects jointly financedwith local authorities.Personal social services16. The personal social services key sector loanapprovals are made in response to an annualbidding system, having regard to local priorities and to the total value of bids per head of population.The total programme has been heavily cut inrecent years but, provided bids of a sufficient valueare received from inner city authorities (and thctendency is for Metropolitan Districts and London boroughs to bid more heavily than shire counties),there is some natural bias towards them because.regardless of population, it would be very exceptional for any authority&apos;s top priority schemenot to be selected. In addition there is a marginalbias in favour of inner cities in the 1978-79 pro-gramme because, where the available allocation is insufficient for a complete scheme of limitedpriority, allocations have been made for such schemes from partnership and programme authon-tics at the expense of similar schemes arisingelsewhere.Employment17. Certain expenditure on programme 4.7 favourshigh unemployment areas over others, thereby in-herently favouring inner city areas. The mainexamples are the youth opportunities programme(YOP), community industry (CI) and thc specialtemporary employment programme (STEP)- ^addition, STEP and the special employment needsdevelopment programme (SEN) have been biasedexplicitly towards inner cities. The funding arrange-ments for the former allow for priority to be givento schemes in areas which arc hardest hit by unem-ployment and those inner city areas which theGovernment has stated to be in need of special assistance. So far as the latter is concerned, halfof the forty-seven SEN employment advisors pr0&apos;vided for the one year experiment have beenassigned to inner city job centres and employmentoffices. Programmes which do not explicitly favourinner cities over other areas but which neverthelessbenefit them include the job centre programme andthe training opportunities scheme.18. The additional posts in the careers advisory service are being related to the level of unem-ployment among young people and will similarlyfavour inner city areas. From July 1978 the smallfirms employment subsidy is to be extendedspecifically to the inner city partnership areas.Education19. The local authorities&apos; allocations of key sectorcapital starts programmes have where possibletaken account of the needs of the inner cities andeprived areas, in the case of the schools improvements programme, the special programme toassistcomprehensive reorganisation (SPAR) and the mainnursery education building programme. Forlatter it has been possible to meet nearly 90 VcXcent of the bids received from such areas compawith 66 per cent of the bids from other areas.
Supplementary Analysis GProportion of the SPAR programme has beenspecifically devoted to additional projects in innercity areas.20. Provision was included in the Rate support grant settlement for 1978-79 to allow for theemployment by local authorities of an additionalUOOO teachers to meet the needs of disadvantagedchildren.Housing21. Partnerships and programme authorities receivespecial priority in the allocation of local authority housing resources. In 1977-78 this was  663 million(30 per cent) rising to  725 million (31 per cent) in1978-79.Home Office services22. The Home Office local authority programmes,of which the police is the most important, aremanpower intensive and demand-led. They are supported by specific grant and this system broadlyenables the needs of inner cities to be met, althoughthe services concerned cannot be explicitly biasedon a geographical basis.Urban programme: EnglandTable gi  million1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 1982-83Other environmental sen ices 4-5       4-2       51 701977 Budget construction package .

The urban programme in Scotland, which isa service to be devolved under the Scotland Bill,is co-ordinated by the Urban Renewal Unit of thcScottish Development Department.24. The urban programme figures for 1979-80and later years reflect the major expansion of theprogramme giving effect to thc government&apos;s decision in April 1977 to allocate additional resources to assist deprived inner city areas. Muchof Scotlands  10 million share of the constructionpackage announced in the Chancellors April 1977Budget was allocated to the urban programme forthe years 1977-78 and 1978-79. These resourceshave been further increased by the allocation ofan additional  1 million for 1978-79 from Scotland&apos;s share of the extra resources for environmentalwork announced in the 1978 Budget speech.25. Expenditure supported by urban programmegrant is allocated to a single public expenditure sub-programme (in programme 8. other environmental services) and is not, meantime, allocated tofunctional sub-programmes. The attached analysis of expenditure by main services is illustrative only as the actual pattern of expenditure for forecastyears will depend on the priority needs identifiedby local authorities in submitting schemes for grant. The anticipated pattern of expenditure andsplit between current and capital expenditure derives from applications received during the course of theyear in respect of major comprehensive schemes andapplications in respect of projects traditionallyassociated with the urban programme. Theadditional construction resources for 1977-79 areexpected to be taken up as planned.26. Within the expanded programme for 1979-80and later years, most of the additional resourceswill be available to assist agreed renewal pr0*grammes in major areas of urban deprivation ordereliction with the emphasis on projects hiGlasgow, particularly in the early years. The need to maintain the scope for new revenue projects asmajor renewal schemes develop such as the GlasgowEastern Area Renewal Project, is reflected in theswitch of capital provision to current expenditurein 1981-82 and 1982-83. To maintain the impetusof major renewal schemes and to allow fQtimplementation of the Inner Urban Areas Bill,additional resources will be required and anadditional bid has been included in chapter 8 ofthc report.27. Although the urban programme provides a valuable source of launching assistance for priorityprojects in areas of deprivation, continued emphasis is being given to the slanting of other main Scottishexpenditure programmes to the needs of depriveurban areas.
