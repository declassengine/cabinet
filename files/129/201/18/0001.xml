I set out in this paper the economic background against which we must consider our future public expenditure plans.GROWTH PROSPECTS:   1978 and 19792. When we made our decision on the 1977 Survey last autumn the economy was beginning to pick up.    Consumer spending, which had been veryweak in the early part of 1977, was recovering, helped by the decline in therate of inflation.    Investment was rising and the balance of payments wasmoving into surplus.    On the crucial assumption that earnings in the 1977-78pay round would be within the Governments limit of 10 per cent it seemedreasonable to look for a growth of output of nearly 3^ per cent through 1978.And on the assumptions that we would continue to contain inflation successfully,that world trade would recover and that we would improve our industrialperformance, it appeared that we might sustain a rate of growth of that orderover the ensuing years.3. I warned a year ago that the balance of risk was not symmetrical:there was a greater chance that we should do worse than that we should do better than the projections suggested.    In the event, the past year has fallen short of justifying the assumptions we then made.4. First, the level of pay settlements in the current round is likely to beabout 13-14 per cent.    This is lower than many outside observers hadpredicted but well above the 10 per cent we had earlier assumed.    The facethat we nevertheless reached our inflation target is due to the unexpectedappreciation in the   which has since been reversed.    Meanwhile the higher level of earnings will reduce our competitiveness.5. Secondly, world trade has been more sluggish than had been expected.In most countries activity has been low and unemployment has risen. Onlythe United States has expanded faster than the growth of its productive potential and the United States is now reining back its expansion.6. Thirdly, our industrial performance has not improved as much aswe assumed.    Our import propensity, particularly for manufactured goods,has continued to rise.    We have not yet seen the recovery in productivity forwhich we hoped last year, and indeed there has been very little rise in1
recorded productivity in the past four years.    The precise reasons for this are not clear.    It may reflect both the low levels of investment in the recentpast and a failure to introduce new processes at a time when activity and profits were depressed.    It would be wrong to be dogmatic about what this implies for the future trend.    Evidence is accumulating that the economy ison the move again.    It still seems reasonable to expect productivity toimprove as output rises and we benefit from the sharp recovery in manufacturing investment now under way.    Over the medium term all thework done under the Industrial Strategy should produce more substantialresults.    But it may be some years before productivity regains the rate of growth that obtained before 1973.7. In consequence, the balance of payments has not improved over thepast 12 months as much as had been expected.    Export performance was good last year - we increased our share of world trade - but has faltered thisyear, while imports have continued at too high a level.    The improvement inthe balance of payments has been reduced also by slippages in the productionof North Sea oil.    Though in time these should be made up, it is unlikely thatwe shall achieve in the next two years the levels of oil production earlierpredicted.8. It was against this general background that we felt it necessary at thetime of the Budget to revise downwards to some 3 per cent our expectationsfor growth to mid-1979.9. On the capital account of the balance of payments outflows of capitalhave reflected a weakening of confidence both in the foreign exchange market -where we have at times had to intervene to support sterling on a substantial scale - and in the domestic financial markets.    In both attention has focussedon the growth of money supply ( M3) and the problems of funding a public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) of the size now in prospect.    We tookaction on 8 June to deal with this situation, which had been aggravated by theOpposition amendments to the Finance Bill.    Though financing problems havegiven us no reason to diverge from our original Budget strategy, they remainan important constraint on our room for manoeuvre.GROWTH PROSPECTS BEYOND 197910. Looking further ahead, the prospect is coloured by the samepersistent uncertainties concerning the level of world trade and the rate of cost inflation in Britain compared with that in our competitors, our lowproductivity, and rising import propensities.    So inflation and the balanceof payments continue to limit our room for manoeuvre.11. The prospects for financing the PSBR - so far as they can be assessedat this early stage - also look tight, at least for the next two years. Thelatest projections both by internal and by outside forecasters continue tosuggest a PSBR in 1979-80 and 1980-81 running well above thc level this year,when I deliberately went to the margin of what I felt able to finance, consistencywith keeping monetary growth under control.    And this is on certain assumptions which are pretty restrictive - that tax allowances and specific
duties are indexed strictly in line with inflation.    The implied increases inindirect tax rates would raise the retail price index.    It could be moredifficult to achieve the necessary moderation in pay bargaining if we couldnot offer income tax cuts which go beyond compensation for inflation.    If weindex tax allowances in line with prices, while the social security benefits are indexed to earnings (where these are higher than prices), the povertytrap will be widened again after the narrowing in recent Budgets.    For bothsocial and economic reasons we should be planning instead to raise taxthresholds in real terms.12. From about 1981 onwards the growing revenue from North Sea oil mayreduce these constraints.    However, projections that far ahead are at thisstage speculative.    We shall need to be more sure of the size and timing ofany fiscal margin before we begin to allocate it in policy decisions.    And, asI have suggested, there are arguments for using a large part of any fiscalmargin for tax reliefs.    In any case after our experience in recent years,we should be unwise to commit it before we can confidently expect it toaccrue.IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PLANS13. Economic forecasts can at best be no more than a rough guide to policy.No one concerned with producing or using them would place much weight on the detailed figures in numerical projections.    But there is little doubt about thegeneral nature of the prospect.    At the time of the Budget we had to revisedown our short-term expectations for growth to 3 per cent.    We shall need to succeed in our present efforts both to strengthen our own industrial perform-ance and to increase world trade if our economy is to sustain an averagegrowth rate of that order over the medium term.    If the projections for thePSBR in 1979-80 and 1980-81 are anywhere near correct, even our present plans for public expenditure may give rise to difficult decisions on tax ratesand allowances.14. The current prospect shows the wisdom of last year&apos;s decisions tokeep the planned growth of public expenditure well within the prospectivegrowth of national resources.    As a result, the factors which have caused usto lower projections of Gross Domestic Product growth need not compel us toreduce our expenditvre plans.    But I see no room for further increasing the totals for public spending in 1979-80 and 1980-81 which we agreed in lastyear&apos;s survey, or for planning now to increase it more than 2 per cent a yearthereafter.D W treasury Chambers28 June 19783
