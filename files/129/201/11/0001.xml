IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78)6l COPY NO gO22 May 1978CABINETREFORM OF SECTION 2 OF THE OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT 1911:DRAFT WHITE paper memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Departmentj* f      The Queen&apos;s Speech at the beginning of this Session stated that^^alative proposals would be brought forward for the reform of Section 2 ofto&amp; ^*^c*a* Secrets Act 1911.    Shortly afterwards we announced our intentionProceed by way of a White Paper to allow full discussion of all the issuesEvolved.1I circulate herewith a draft White Paper for the approval of the Cabinet.3.with the first and main section of the draft (paragraphs 1 to 38) deals withreform of Section 2.    It has been discussed and agreed in the Ministerial^roUp 0n the Enclosure of Official Information (GEN 29).    The proposalse rnuch as I announced in my statement of 22 November 1976, subject toV a few points of difference:  for instance, I have further considered my proposal for a &quot;DEFENCE AND INTERNATIONAL - CONFIDENTIAL&quot; categoryclassification, and I now conclude that it is undesirable for the scope of therninal law in that field to be as wide as had been intended (seepai,*graphs 16 to 22).4,t^       We should now get our proposals on the form of Section 2 clearly on 0^Or^*    It is a subject which we have had under review since we took office0 .r years ago.    We are firmly committed to publication this Session, now by The Queen&apos;s Speech but by statements made since then by the Primemster and by me.5.Though the reform of Section 2 - which deals with the use of theQ    na-l law as a sanction against unauthorised disclosure - is technicallylriceParate issue from that of open government - which is concerned with at *eas*ng the volume and range of information published - the two subjectsseen as related, and there are many people, not least among ourSecj\0rters in Parliament, who would think a White Paper on the reform of011 2 incomplete without a section on open government and preferably^ey would see it) a commitment to freedom of information legislation.ca 8
The draft White Paper has a second section (paragraphs 39 to 50) which deals*ith this matter.    It has been written to take account of feelings in the party on the subject.    It has been agreed with the Lord Privy Seal but not, in this form, discussed in GEN 29.    It is clearly difEcult to achieve the rightbalance of arguments.    We have sought to go as far as possible inRecognising the point of view of those who advocate freedom of informationiegislation (though not underrating its disadvantages), while maintaining theGovernment&apos;s stance that the need for legislation to achieve the desiredobjectives is not proved.6- This will not go far enough to satisfy everybody.    But we should notW sight of the fact that it is the reform of Section 2 with which we havebeen mainly concerned and to which our commitments relate.    We are in aPosition to announce our proposals about this, and it is my consideredjudgment that we should now do so.    As to open government, we can point^ what has been done;  and we can justifiably take (as the draft White Paperdoes) the position that, given that Section 2 has had some effect in creating a general aura of secrecy, we should see what the reform of Section 2 doest0 dispel that aura and change attitudes in the public service, before weconsider whether to proceed to legislation which would be cumbersome and costly and may be unnecessary.7- I invite the Cabinet to approve the publication of a White Paper, intbe form of the draft attached, before the Summer Recess.M R^e Office22 May 19782
^fiM OF SECTION 2 OF THE OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT 1911^ WHITE paper i^oductipnemocracy, people should have information about the workings of government.out it, they cannot call their representatives to account and make informed useOf the&apos;eir rights as citizens and electors.   Nevertheless all Governments find itessary, in the national interest, to keep some information secret.   In theS hands certain information cculd undermine our vital interests or even our^ety aJ as a sovereign and independent country.   Therefore, for us, as for all^cies, there is an inescapable tension between the need to keep some informa-Secret and the requirements of openness if people are to participate innment as they should.   A balance must be struck and it has to be reviewedto time to see thai it is in keeping with current perceptions of the6at tnuo our security and the needs of democracy.)lnce 1889Si,we have employed the criminal law as one important means of preservingt.hs secrecy.   The United Kingdom is not alone in using the criminal law for^P08^.   In France it is a criminal offence to disclose or publishformat -*   ion &quot;v/hich ought to be kept secret in the interests of the defence of the^      &apos;   ln- Sweden a public servant may be prosecuted for disclosing informationtief    1S sPecified in the Secrecy Act including, for example, information about$4.   06 matters, and international relations and Cabinet records.   In the Unitedtes of A0 America it is an offence &quot;knowingly and wilfully&quot; to communicate, furnishf*Uf      ai^&quot;a^ie to 011 unauthorised person, or to publish any classified informationC(w       to codes or cyphers etc, or to devices used for cryptographic orot       **nons intelligence purposes, or to communications intelligence activities^Uth tilrous^ suc^ activities.   Indeed in most Western countries, thefyi    0r*sed disclosure of at least certain types of official information is a^ offence.6ecf.    ase the main criminal offences relating to official information are inc0h        &apos; and 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911.   Of these, section 1 is with disclosure for a purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of\
^6 state, whilst section 2 covers the unauthorised disclosure of officialformation irrespective of the discloser1s purpose.   It is the view of theernment that the time has come to reform section 2.   This White Paper describesW Section 2 might be replaced by legislation which would apply criminal sanctionsa more limited area of information.The Off-iiicial Secrets Acts 1911 to 1939 are intended to prevent the unauthorised-&quot;-osure of official information.   Section 1 of the 1911 Act makes it an offence,purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the state, to communicatey information which might be directly or indirectly useful to an enemy. The*minimun penalty is fourteen years&apos; imprisonment.   Section 2 of the 1911 Act makes^ offence for any person holding office under Her Majesty to communicatez authority to any person any information which he has obtained because ofis off -X1cial position and for any person to receive such information.   The maximumcy is tv/o years&apos;  imprisonment.   It has been widely suggested that section 2$would  v.De repealed or amended and it is now generally agreed that the section is satisfactory as it stands..  Use 2 of the Official Secrets Bill was not discussed in the Parliamentary debatesg       &apos;*   Although the Bill was presented as essential on grounds of nationalrityi clause 2 v/as included because an earlier attempt to prevent leaks oflal information (section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1889) had proved to^  efActive.   The 1911 Bill passed through the House of Commons in one August1^ernoon with very little discussion.   The debates on the Official Secrets ActV;ere not concerned with section 2 of the 1911 Act and the first Parliamentary&apos; on section 2 came 28 years after it first came into effect in the debates onCf        Bill.   Lord Strabolgi, then Opposition Chief Whip in the House of Lords,0  lc^Sed section 2 as &quot;capable of indefinite expansion ... to cover all manner0lnrnuni cat ions and information which may have been received from any one wholds or unas held office under His Majesty&quot;.   He proposed that section 2 should*      0n^y to disclosures made &quot;for any purpose prejudicial to the safety or1^     s of the state&quot;, but his amendment was held to be outside the scope of theBUl (Official Report, 7 March, cols 30-39)&apos;.3&apos; Silrice then and particularly in the last 10 or 15 years criticism of section 2grQwn.   The report of a joint working party of Justice and the British Committee
f the International Press Institute in 1965 recommended that the scope ofction 2 should be limited.   In the late 1960s there were several Private Members&apos;aesigned to amend section 2.   The Fulton report proposed that &quot;the Governmentshould p .set up an enquiry to make recommendations for getting rid of unnecessarycrecy in this country.   Clearly, the Official Secrets Acts would need to becluded in such a review&quot;.   A Departmental Committee under Lord Franks was pointed by the then Home Secretary in April 1971 &quot;to review the operation ofs^c t ion 2 of the Official Secrets Act.1911 and to make recommendations&quot;. Itsit *nc&quot;l&quot;uded representatives of both Houses of Parliament and the media and received a formidable volume of written and oral evidence.s the Home Secretary announced in a statement to the House of Commons onr 1976, the Government1s proposals are based on the recommendations ofcommittee.   It will not be possible to introduce legislation in theent Session of Parliament so the Government has taken the opportunity to make-15 proposals in more detail.   The proposals are carefully considered butconnaent6 and public discussion would be welcome on all of them.   There v/ill be^ to^ take full account of all the comments before a Bill is brought beforelament.22 Novembethe Franksth efore discussing how section 2 might be replaced it is necessary to considerCom&amp;ii ^ features of section 2 itself.   The main offence is the unauthorisedUriication of official information by any person who holds or has held office6r Hper Majesty.   But the section prohibits many other forms of behaviour. For^     &apos; a person may not communicate to an unauthorised person information v/hichb      en entrusted in confidence to him by any person holding office underkeh y or which he has obtained as a person who holds a contract made on0- Her Majesty.   Other parts of section 2 make it an offence** tnuse information for the benefit of any foreign PowerJj0 communicate information about munitions of war directly or indirectly0 a foreign Power*&quot; tnretain official papers which should be returned** tn efail to take reasonable care of official papers and
to receive information knowing or having reasonable ground to believe thatit is communicated in contravention of the 1911 Act *^* Thne Franks committee made a study of prosecutions under section 2 and^ised the position as follows (paragraph 25):Hpooecutions have been few.   Recently they have averaged about one a year.rom 19^5 to 1971 twenty-three prosecutions were brought involving thirty-our defendants, of whom twenty-seven were convicted and six acquitted; in^ne case the charge was withdraw/n.   Nearly two-thirds of the defendants wererown servants or former crowdy/n servants, including a number of police andPrison officers.   Only two cases since the war have involved professionalJournalists.   Well over one-third of the twenty-three cases involved^formation relating to matters of defence, national security or intelligence.. e-third concerned police or prison information.    In three cases theinformation related to international affairs&quot;.but ^ere kave been three prosecutions under section 2 involving four people0nly one person was convicted, in 1975;    the rest were all acquitted. There0 tv/o cases, involving four people, now before the courts.^      e major objection to section 2 has been that it makes it criminal to discloseNecessarily wide range of official information.   It catches all informationAct        lstln-ction.   There must be hundreds of technical contraventions of theVery aav ag Qrown servants tell friends and relatives trivial details about^    0rK*   There are two devices which help to make sense of this catch-all.lri Government there is a concept of implied authorisation by which communicationen to be authorised if it is part of an officer&apos;s jcb.   The Franks committee^enteo that Ministers were, in effect, self-authorising.   In addition the&amp;a ,      0f ^e Attorney General is an essential pre-requisite of any prosecutionthat fys- .u, urivial and technical breaches never reach the courts.    In Scotland,&apos;6 tCaf        Advocate has direct responsibility for all such prosecutions.   But thecll-al]^ x quality of section 2 is not the only objection to it. It is common for^ oa to have to be shown to have mens rea or guilty knowledge before he canConvictce^ of a criminal offence.   The Franks committee considered this inl0n to section 2 (paragraph 20):c** Section 2(l)(a), which creates the offence of unauthorised disclosure,off a:i&quot;n3 nothing to imply directly that mens rea is an ingredient of thejjj , nce*   There has been one recent judicial decision, not binding on thehaj\er courts, that mens rea is an ingredient of this offence.   On the othertv/o previous obiter dicta by eminent Judges have described this offenceby eminent Judgeevi?1 &quot;^solute&quot; one not involving any element of guilty knowledge. Theence we receive showed that there is still uncertainty on this point&quot;.\
** Franks committee summarised its view of section 2 by describing it as a mess.it uncertainty and obscurity needed to be replaced by a new and more limitedBt*tute, straightforward to follow and surer in its effects.^Llganks Reporti1   The committee, which reported in September 1972, recommended that section 2&quot;     Official Secrets Act 1911 should be repealed and replaced in a new OfficialNation Act by narrower and more specific provisions.   These provisions can beised as follows:* The Act should apply to classified (see II below) information in the areasof;(i)   defence and internal security;(ii)    foreign relations; and(iii)   currency and the reserves.^    Classification should be handled as follows:(i)    Information should count as classified if it is correctly gradedas SECRET or above or DEFENCE-CONFIDENTIAL.(ii)   There should be detailed regulations about classification.(iii)   The responsible Minister should personally review the correctnessof the classification of information before its diclosure becomes thesubject of a prosecution.   If satisfied that it was correct he shouldSive a certificate to that effect to the court which should be conclusive evidence of the point.(iv)   The Government and the news media should discuss the possibilityof establishing an informal committee on classification which would be consulted about the regulations on classification and would act as a reference point for queries from, for example, a journalist about the classification of information which had come into his hands.*   The Act should apply to all information, irrespective of classification,^e following categories:
(i)   Law and order, for example, information likely to be helpful inthe commission of offences.(ii)   Papers and minutes of Cabinet and Ministerial Cabinet Committeesprovided the document or a substantial part of it or information toallow the reproduction of the document or a substantial part of it istransmitted.(iii)   Information given to the Government by private individuals orconcerns.(iv)   Information which is used for private gain or disclosed with a viewto private gain by some other person.IV   It should be an offence for a Crown servant to communicate information towhich the Official Information Act applies, contrary to his official duty.V There should be specific provisions for Government contractors and personsentrusted with official information in confidence.VI   It should be an offence for other persons to communicate, withoutauthority, information which they know or have reasonable ground to believehas already been communicated in contravention of the Official InformationAct.VlH In England and Wales, there should be no prosecution without the consentof the Director of Public Prosecutions, in the case of some offences, ortlle Attorney General, in the case of others.h.        a House of Commons debate on 29 June 1973 there was general support forvipV/ that the Franks committee1s proposals were broadly acceptable althoughticui^ ^    *ar points needed to be studied further.   The specific proposals of thereport summarised above and set out in more detail on pages 102-9 of thePort ,^ i snould therefore be seen as the starting point for the Government&apos;s present(jj, The relevant pages of the Franks report are reproduced as an annex toWhite Paper.aiiiScope of an Official Information Bill&apos;0-  It the&quot; ***y to proposals in this White Paper command support, the Government would introduce a 3ill based generally on the recommendations of the Franks
committee.   The receipt of information and the unauthorised disclosure of a wide range of official information would no longer be a criminal offence.   The newcriminal offences v/ould include carefully defined defences so that the doubt about whether section 7 created a strict liability offence (see paragraph 1^ above)vould come to an end.   The result should be to improve the quality and effective-ness of the criminal law and to remove the theoretical threat of prosecution forconduct v/hich does not warrant it.11. After further detailed consideration of the proper scope for the offences inthe Bill$ the Governments general approach is that laid down by the HomeSecretary in his statement of 22 November 197&amp;:&quot;... in considering the categories of information that ought to be protected by the criminal law we think it right to draw a clearer distinction betweenhome and economic policy on the one hand and security and intelligence,defence and international relations on the other.   The unauthorised disclosure of any official information is wrong because it is unauthorised.   But in the domestic area it will generally result in embarrassment to the Government ofthe day and not in any serious damage to the national interest.    In the fields of security and intelligence, defence and international relations onthe other hand, such damage may veil result.&quot;   (Official Report, col 1879)The following three paragraphs deal with topics where the Franks committee recommended provisions which the Government does not intend to embody in an official information Bill.   The Government has also decided to provide greater safeguards^an those recommended by the Franks committee for people under threat ofprosecution for unauthorised disclosure of classified information.   Although it will still be for the responsible Minister to certify that the information in question had been properly classified, his decision will require endorsement by the Attorney-General, or, in Scotland, the Lord Advocate before prosecution is practicallyFusible (see paragraph 2b below).12.  he Franks committee recommended that the criminal law should protect informa-tion relating to any proposals, negotiations or decisions connected with alterations^ the value of sterling, or relating to the reserves, including their extent ormovement in or threat to them. The recommendation for singling out information*bout currency and the reserves from the whole range of economic policy was made intll* climate of 1971-72.   The committee were impressed by the argument that, in a
.R.system of fixed exchange rates, premature disclosure of the Government&apos;s intentionscould have an especially serious effect on the national interest.   The government cannot see a clear basis for distinguishing between different types of economic information.   Who is to say that a leak about the currency and reserves would always be more damaging than a leak about monetary or fiscal policies? TheGovernment, therefore, considered whether it would be right to apply criminal sanctions to all types of economic information.   Although there is no doubt thatthe unauthorised disclosure of some economic information can do serious damage tothe interests of the nation as a whole, it is not generally of the same kind as the damage that could be done by a leak of, for example, defence or security and intelligence information.   As there is no longer a logical basis on which to restdistinctions in the economic field the Government, accordingly, concluded that the criminal offence should not extend to economic information.13*  The Franks committee also recommended (at No 11 of their proposals) that thecriminel offence should apply to Cabinet and Cabinet Committee documents, that is,documents submitted for the consideration of the Cabinet and Cabinet Committeesand documents recording the proceedings or conclusions of the Cabinet and cabinet committees, irrespective of subject matter and security classification. Thepurpose of this recommendation was to safeguard the collective responsibility ofthe Cabinet;   and it was limited to the communication of the actual document or information based on the document in a verbatim or virtually verbatim form. TheGovernment attaches major importance to the security of Cabinet and Cabinet Committeedocuments.   For the generality of these documents, however, the great majority ofwhich deal with home and economic affairs, the Government considers that it isenough to rely on special distribution and handling procedures, on the sanctionsQf Civil Service discipline and on the judgement of Ministers.   It is therefore proposed that Cabinet and Cabinet Committee documents should be protected bycriminal sanctions only if they fall into one of the specific categories of informa-tion to be so protected.&quot;9  The Franks committee recommended that it should be an offence for a crown servant and certain others to use official information for the purpose ofStaining private gain for himself or any other person, or to communicate theformation to any other person with a view to enabling that person or any otherPsrson to obtain private gain.   The committee recognised that this would in effect a
form an extension of the existing law on corruption.   Since 1972 the RoyalCorjnission on Standards of Conduct in Public Life, under the chairmanship ofLord Salmon, has been appointed and reported.   In its report (Cmnd 652k) theCocnission made recommendations about the misuse of official information in the context of its study of legislation on corruption in public life.   They madedetailed recommendations for offences concerned with the corrupt use of official information which seemed to them more appropriate for legislation on corruptionthan for legislation on official information.   In due course there will belegislation as a result of the Salmon report although the results of extensiveconsultation about its implications are still being digested.   As the misuse of official information for private gain is widely recognised as a matter of thelaw of corruption it seems appropriate not to seek to deal with it in anOfficial Information Bill but to reserve it for legislation on corruption. .15. The Government has decided to retain the categories of defence and internal security, international relations, law and order and confidences of the citizenwhich were recommended by the ?ranks committee, and to create a further category of intelligence and security.   It will also be necessary to apply criminal sanctions to protective security measures.   These matters are discussed in more detail below.Defence and internal security and international relations16, There is likely to be a broad measure of agreement that information aboutdefence measures and equipment deserves to be protected by the criminal law. TheGovernment is in no doubt about the Franks committee&apos;s recommendation for acategory of defence and internal security.   Amongst those who gave evidence to theconanittee opinion was more divided about international relations.   It is,perhaps, less self-evident than in the case of defence that some information inthe field of international relations deserves protection by the criminal law. Butthe Government1 s firm view is that, as the Franks report recorrjnended, there shouldbe a category of international relations in order to cover, for example,^formation about the international negotiations on the success of which couldturn matters of vital national interest.   In the case of some international legislation, as the Franks committee pointed out, &quot;the frank and honest exvosureQf differing points of view, the exploration of possible concessions, the strikingQf bargains, is handicapped if conducted in the open&quot;.
E.R,17*   Having argued the need for these two categories the committee went on topoint out that there is no reason to protect a piece of information with criminal sanctions just because it is concerned with defence or international relations.Some defence and international relations information is public knowledge; other information is about to be made public and it would do no serious damage for itto be disclosed a little earlier than the Government had intended.   So it followed that in these categories the Franks committee had to find a way to distinguish between information which deserved protection and that which did not.   There is a legitimate public interest in the way our country is defended and the way our international relations are conducted.   It v/ould be quite wrong for the naturaltension between the need for secrecy and the public wish for information to be resolved by applying the criminal law to the unauthorised disclosure of all information in these categories.   The Government, therefore, endorses the Franksapproach, though the task of giving detailed effect to this broad approach hasthrown up one of the more difficult issues in the Government&apos;s own considerationof how best to replace section 2.18. The Franks committee recommended that information in the categories of defence and international relations should only be protected if its disclosure, by a crown servant, contrary to his official duty, would cause at least serious injury tothe interests of the nation.   In order that Crown servants and others would know where they stood in relation to particular information, the Franks committeesuggested that documents should only be protected if marked with the word SECRETor, in the case of certain defence information, marked DEFENCE CONFIDENTIAL. Inhis statement to the House of Commons in November 1976, the Home Secretary proposedthat the concept of DEFENCE CONFIDENTIAL should be extended to become DEFENCE and international CONFIDENTIAL in order to cover a wider range of defence and interna-tional relations information than the Franks committee had suggested,19. One important question in this area is whether the right test for criminalityis serious injury to the interests of the nation, which is the current definitionfor the classification SECRET for official information.   The Franks reportrecognised (in paragraph 118) that some people might consider it anomalous not toProtect to the fullest possible extent information in the defence field whichcight not meet the high test of serious injury to the nation but was still capableQf doing some damage to our interests.   A sensible case can be made out for drawingthe line somewhat less tightly than the Franks committee recommended, for example,adopting the test of whether the disclosure would be prejudicial to the
interests of the nation, which is the current definition for the classificationCONFIDENTIAL for official information.   It could be argued that if informationjustifies the various physical measures that are required to protect what is class-ified CONFIDENTIAL it is reasonable to employ the criminal law as a deterrentagainst unauthorised disclosure.20. Problems arise in the field of international relations.   There is material, nowclassified CONFIDENTIAL, which might if revealed either prejudice the success ofinternational negotiations, damage relations with other countries or endanger the safety of United Kingdom citizens overseas or of foreign nationals.   This material is properly classified CONFIDENTIAL rather than SECRET because its disclosurewould fall short of the test of causing serious injury to the interests of the nation,whatever might be the other effects of its disclosure.   It was to safeguard- this type of material that the Government proposed in 1976 extending DEFENCECONFIDENTIAL to DEFENCE AND INTERNATIONAL CONFIDENTIAL.   However, it could equallybe held that the risk of unauthorised disclosure of such information does not warrant the additional safeguard of criminal sanctions.   In which case, the test of criminality in the foreign affairs field would be &quot;serious injury&quot; (ie thecurrent test for SECRET) as the Franks report recommended.21*  The question of where to draw the line is complicated by the difficulties which led to the recommendation in the Franks report for information classified DEFENCECONFIDENTIAL to be protected by the criminal law.   Some information in the defencefield which really satisfies the test for a marking of SECRET is neverthelessmarked CONFIDENTIAL for reasons which the Franks committee took into account. Thefirst reason is the very large quantity of classified information in the defencefield.   Every effort is made to reduce the requirements for the handling ofSECRET and SECRET information in the Ministry of Defence and by defencecontractors so that resources can be conserved and more effort can be devoted to tie close protection of especially sensitive information.   Secondly, the disclosureQf a large number of individual items of information, each properly classifiedCONFIDENTIAL (for example, details of the performance of new military equipment)Vould in many cases cause serious injury to the national interest, if it were all^sembled together, for example, on a computer tape.   Thirdly, there are special^angeraents, particularly with the USA, for the safeguarding of defence information^ich is known to more than one country.   Much of this information, though highly^sitive, bears a security marking of CONFIDENTIAL in agreement with the USauthorities.   The Franks committee saw the force of these arguments but recommended
that its solution of a marking of DEFENCE CONFIDENTIAL should only be used inrelation to information about military weapons and equipment.   The Government is satisfied that DEFENCE CONFIDENTIAL should be used for a wider range of defenceinformation than Franks suggested.   Similar considerations arise in relation to information about defence policy and strategy, as the Home Secretary said inNovember 197&amp;i and in relation to the other types of defence information, that is,intelligence and security, military treaties and arrangements with other countries and internal defence and security.22.  Although it is necessary to take account of the origins of DEFENCE confidential and the Governments decision to apply it to a wider range of defence information,these considerations do not help directly in deciding what should be the test forcriminality.   V/hile criminal sanctions might be justified for some of the information which meets the &quot;prejudicial&quot; test but not the &quot;serious injury&quot; test, to adopt the&quot;prejudicial&quot; test would necessarily bring in a considerable volume of other information v/hich does not need this protection.   The Government believes, however,that the scope of the criminal law in this field must be restricted.   The Governmentspresent view is that, despite the arguments rehearsed in paragraphs 19 and 20, itwould hi best to follow the recommendation of the Franks committee by adopting thete6t of &quot;serious injury in the defence and international relations field. DEFENCEconcernedCONFIDENTIAL would not be extended to information/with international relationsoutside the defence field and it would not be extended to defence information which would be no more than &quot;prejudicial&quot; to our interests if disclosed.   This canQaly be a matter of balance and judgement.^3.  In the categories of defence and international relations the Franks committee proposed that the offence should be based on the classification marking of documents.8* Government accepts that Crown servants, contractors and members of the publicneed to know whether or not they are handling protected information, and that this can only be done sensibly in this area by marking documents.   But it was recognisedl&amp; the report that qualifications were needed to this general approach in the case0? oral disclosure and documents from which markings have been removed withoutauthorisation.   The Government has also identified one or two other situations, not mentioned by the Franks committee, where an approach based only on marking wouldquite fit. For example, if a document contained extremely sensitive information^ was known to do so by the person who originated it, it would not be satisfactoryIf he could escape liability under the criminal law because he deliberately failed
to mark the document.   For these reasons it will be necessary when it comes to the precise definition of an offence to make it clear that the test of criminality isthe likelihood that the disclosure of information will seriously damage our interestand not simply the fact that a document has been marked.   Partly because of theneed for people to know v/here they stand and partly because offences involving the disclosure of a marked document should be readily capable of proof, marking will still be very important.   The system of classification markings would be embeddedin the Bill, as the Franks committee recommended, by including the definitions ofeach security marking in the Bill and providing an enabling power for regulationsabout classification to be made.   It would also seem desirable, in view of the*ay the offence would be drafted to provide that, where the accused was alleged to have handled a classified document, the fact that it was marked in accordancewith the provisions of the Bill should raise a presumption that the accused knewor had reasonable cause to believe that the information in question v/as protected by the Act.   It would, of course, be open to the accused to show that this wasnot so.2**.  The Franks committee recommended that before there was a prosecution for the disclosure of information in the categories of defence and international relations,the responsible Minister should review the information in question to see whetherits unauthorised disclosure would cause serious injury to the interests of thenation.   If he was satisfied on the point, he should give a certificate to that effect to the court and only in that case would a prosecution take place. Thiscertificate was to be conclusive evidence that the disclosure of the information would cause serious injury to our interests.   The Government accepts that the onlyappropriate person to conduct the review of the status of the information is the responsible Minister.   In almost every case he will not have been involved in any decision about the proper level of classification marking so that he will bring tocear a fresh and independent mind.   Only he can be fully aware of the contextVr-ich would determine whether the disclosure would cause serious injury.   As anadditional safeguard, the question will also be studied by the Attorney General0r, in Scotland, the Lord Advocate.   If he agrees that the information meets thec-serious injury test, he will authorise the certificate to be entered in evidence in the trial.   Otherwise, he will not authorise the certificate to be entered inevidence, which would mean in effect that there could be no prosecution.25.  It was suggested in the Franks report that the Government should enter into discussions with representatives of the news media and with any other interests
directly affected with a view to the establishment of an informal committee onclassification.   The Home Secretary would be ready to initiate the discussions as recommended, nearer the time that it seems likely that a Bill is to be introduced.Law and order26,  As is mentioned in paragraph 15 above, the Franks committee recommended thatthere should be a law and order category.   The Government agrees that it should bea criminal offence to disclose information (including police, prison and Post Officeinformation) which comes within one of the three following descriptions:(a) it is likely to be helpful in the commission of offences;(b) it is likely to be helpful in facilitating an escape from legal custodyor other acts prejudicial to prison security;(c) its disclosure would be likely to impede the prevention or detection of offences or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders.It is central to the continuation of our way of life that law and order should be preserved.   There is a legitimate and desirable public interest in information relating to the organisation and conduct of the police, the courts and the prisons0ut there can be no legitimate interest in information which, for example, would help directly in the commission of a crime.   Nevertheless the Government isconcerned that when the definition of this category comes to be drafted for theBill, it should be framed so that there can be no doubt that the criminal sanctionapplies only when there are strong reasons, as set out above, for preservingconfidentiality.Confidences of the citizen2?*  The Franks committee recommended that the new offence should catch informationSiven to the Government by private individuals or concerns, whether given byreason of compulsory powers or otherwise, and whether or not given on an express0r implied basis of confidence.   The report based the case for criminal sanctions^0r this category on the need to maintain the relationship of trust between the State^d the citizen, and not on considerations of privacy.   This accounted for thelimitation to information given to the Government.   Nevertheless, in the HouseQf Commons debate on the Franks report in June 1973. both the Government and the^position took the view that, in view of the current concern with the protection
of privacy, the area of information to be protected should be wider than thatrecommended by the committee.   The Home Secretary of the day, now Lord Carr, saidthat confidences held by a Government department, however acquired, requiredprotection by the criminal law from improper disclosure.   The Government agrees with this view.   The offence should cover all confidences of the citizen held byCrown servants (see paragraph 32 below).   The main consideration is the paramount importance of reassuring individuals and companies etc that any information about them held by Crown servants will not be improperly disclosed.   Another practicalconsideration is that many files contain an amalgam of information given to aCrown servant and information acquired by other means.   It is not always practicablemonths or years later to identify the category to which a particular piece ofinformation belongs.   Examples of the type of information that would be covered bythis category are damaging information about private citizens or organisations thatis gathered by the police but does not lead to a prosecution, personal detailsgiven to civil servants by social security applicants and particulars given to therevenue departments by individual and corporate tax payers.28. It must be recognised that as a result of this category a very high proportionof the papers in Government Departments etc, particularly those where a largenumber of officials is employed on personal cases, will continue to be subject tocriminal sanctions for unauthorised disclosure.   But the Government regards theseproposals as an important contribution towards safeguarding privacy and believes that they will be generally welcomed.29. Confidences of the citizen would include assessments and opinions about an individual or concern as well as facts.   An assessment of one private individualanother private individual, for example in connection with a job application,could be a confidence of both individuals.   In practice it would sometimes be hard to see the dividing line between fact and opinion, even if the Bill were to seek to draw one.   A confidence will not include information which has already been communicated to the general public, for example, by publication in a newspaper orjournal on sale to anyone.   Much information finds its way on to files in the formQf press cuttings.   It would be wrong for a Crown servant even theoretically to be liable to prosecution if he mentioned to another person something that he had seen in a press cutting.
30. Apart from protecting information about individuals, information aboutorganisations will also be protected and the Government agrees with the franks committee that the confidences of private firms and other private bodies only shouldbe protected.   Any distinction between the private and public sector is difficult to frame with complete consistency.   Careful attention will be given to this point in drafting the Bill and it will be possible then to take account of any views expressed as a result of the publication of the White Paper,Security and intelligence etc31. The Franks committee recommended that security and intelligence information should be protected only if its disclosure would cause serious injury to theinterests of the nation, ie if it merited classification as at least SECRET. Asthe Home Secretary announced, the Government has concluded that information relatingto security and intelligence matters is deserving of the highest protection whetheror not it is classified.   This is pre-eminently an area where the gradual accumulation of small items of information, apparently trivial in themselves, could eventuallycreate a risk for the safety of an individual or constitute a serious threat to theinterescs of the nation as a whole.   Information about security and intelligenceBatters will, therefore, be a separate category in the Bill.   It will also benecessary to apply criminal sanctions to information about such measures for theprotection of official information as ciphers, keys, passes, communicationsequipment and other physical and technical means of preserving security and informa-tion about such measures.   Further thought will need to be given to how best to coverprotective security measures v/hen the Bill comes to be drafted.Offences by crowdy/n servants32. The Franks committee proposed that, under a new Official Information Act, thez^xi offence would be committed by a &quot;Crown servant&quot; rather than, as at present^er section 2 of the 1911 Act, by &quot;a person holding office under Her Majesty&quot;.The definition of Crown servants was to include:(a) Ministers of the Crown;(b) civil servants including the Northern Ireland Civil Service;(c) members of the Armed Forces;(d) members of police forces;
(e) members of the Atomic Energy Authority and the Post Office;(f) persons employed by or serving under the direction or control of anyof the above classes, and members of the legal profession acting for the Crownor for the police in bringing prosecutions;(g) former members of any of the above classes.The report suggested that the general criterion for deciding whether the new Actshould treat officers of bodies which ore not Government departments in the same way as Crown servants is whether the regular functions of the body involve dealingon its ov/n account with information protected by criminal sanctions, and whether that body itself generates information of this kind.   The Government has reviewedall organisations and groups in the public sector not mentioned in the definitionin the Franks report to see whether any satisfy this criterion.   The Government is satisfied that the Civil Aviation Authority needs to be added to the list because it regularly receives and generates sensitive information relating to defence and internal security.   Gaming Board inspectors must also be included because their work is very similar to the work of the police.   There are also some other bodiesthe work of which is connected with that of the Ministry of Defence or the atomic energy Authority, which v/ill have to be covered.33*   The offences which will apply to Crown servants will be as described at 15-17of the summary of proposals in the Franks report save that, for the reasons described in paragraph 23 above, the defence in the categories of defence and international relations will be that a person did not know, and had no reason to believe, thatthe information was covered by the Act.Contractors and persons entrusted with information in confidencey**  In the main the Government proposes to accept as they stand the recommendationsof the Franks committee about contractors and persons entrusted with official information in confidence.   But in addition the Government intends to make it an offence for a contractor or person entrusted with information in confidencewrongfully to disclose a confidence of the citizen.   This follows from the emphasis on the privacy of personal information described in paragraphs 27 and 28 above.&quot; it is necessary, as it may sometimes be, for a Crown servant to entrust a non-Crovn servant with a confidence of the citizen, the citizen is entitled to think thatthe protection of his confidence has not been diminished.
35*  Under the Official Information Act as proposed in the Franks report it wouldnot be a criminal offence for a contractor to disclose information which had beenreceived direct from a foreign government or international organisation. Inparagraph 265 of the report, the committee said that there may be a case for considering how far the same protection as the law gives to contracts placed bythe British Government could and should be given to defence   contracts placed by allied powers.   In a modern military alliance, a country does not normally relyentirely upon military weapons and equipment produced in its own country. Sincethe trend is -towards even greater international co-operation in procurement theGovernment has decided that information given to a defence contractor by a foreign government or international organisation should be protected by the criminal law.There would be provisions to ensure that the offence applied only where UnitedKingdom interests (including international and defence interests) were at stake,The citizen36,  In relation to those who have no kind of special relationship to centralGovernment, as a Crown servant or contractor and so on, the main change will bethat the mere receipt of protected information will no longer be a criminal offence.This has been one of the most widely criticised features of section 2, after careful study the Government believes that the main offence to be committed by a citizen should be a modification of the definition in the Franks report (at 20 ofthe proposals in the annex) so that it would be an offence for a person to communicateinformation (other than information covered by the confidences of the citizencategory) otherwise than in accordance with an authorisation given on behalf of theCrown if the information was covered by the Act at the time and if the accused knewQr had reasonable cause to believe that the information was so covered.   This omitsthe requirement that a contravention of the Act by some other person should beProved and the requirement of proof that the citizen had cause to suspect thatthe information had reached him as a result of a breach of the law by someone else.These are replaced by an onus on the prosecution to show that the accused knew orhad reasonable cause to believe that the information was protected.   The formulationrecommended in the report does not cover a series of possible circumstances wherea Becber of the public might obtain protected information without a breach of the*ct by someone else.   For example, it is possible to steal documents or to read0r Photocopy documents to which one should not have had access or to hearformation on the telephone because of a crossed line.   It does not seem defensible*0r a person to be liable to conviction for disclosing information handed to him in
breach of the Act but not if he had stolen the document containing the information.The proposed changes fill this gap but without removing the safeguards againstunjustified prosecution which are implicit in the above definition of the offence.37.  As a result of the change it will be possible to dispense with the specificoffence recommended by the Franks committee of communicating a document classifiedand marked S^TOST.   There will be an additional ancillary offence of failing orneglecting to comply with a direction issued by a lawful authority to return a document covered by the Act which is in someone&apos;s possession without an authorisatiifrom the Crown.   This is needed to make sure that a citizen returns a documentwhen asked to do so.   Civil procedures would not always be sufficiently urgent oreffective.Ancillary matters38. The Government proposes broadly to adopt the recommendations of the franks committee set out in the report on matters such as control over prosecutions and penalties.   In addition the Bill will have to make it clear that the communication of information includes handing over material as well as communication bydocumentary means or by word of mouth.Section ? and Open Government39. The Franks report suggested that there was some link between the practice of0Pen Government and the need to replace section 2, though not perhaps as close a link as some would have it:&quot;...the evidence as a whole, from within the Government as well asoutside it, indicated that section 2 has some effect in creating ageneral aura of secrecy.   As a result some civil servants are probably less forthcoming than they would otherwise be.   This applies particularly to junior oivil servants, and some of the evidencesuggested that those working in the provinces are more affected thanthose in London.&quot; (para 68)^*  The Government accepts the view of the Franks Committee that section 2,c-cause of its very wide ambit, does have some inhibiting effect on openness in^ernment though strictly speaking, questions of open government do not depend onAction 2, which is concerned only with the information that needs to be^otected from unauthorised disclosure by criminal sanctions, and not with
increasing the output of information whose disclosure is authorised.   But, morethan that, it is a matter of concern to the Government if there is a general impression abroad that the wide scope of section 2 has generated a whollyunacceptable degree of secrecy in government.   The Government have this considerationmuch in mind in proposing reform of section 2.41. The Government recognises and shares the widespread concern that the analysisand reasoning &quot;behind Government policies and decisions should be more widely known and understood.   The longstanding practice of successive Governments in this fieldshould not be underrated.   A large amount of material flows from Governmentdepartments to Parliament and the public; this includes White Papers, Green papers and other consultative documents; a wide range of regular and ad hoc HMSO and departmental publications; information given in answer to Parliamentary Questionsor in debates; written and oral evidence to Select Committees, ministerialcorrespondence with MPs and others; Press Notices and briefings; ministerialstatements and speeches; departmental replies direct to enquirers and assistanceto research students.   In the ordinary course of events, the flow of this typeof information has been steadily increasing over recent years, and will continue todo so.42. Put the Government accepted that more must be done.43. In July 1977 the Head of the Home Civil Service issued, with the approval ofthe Prime Minister, instructions to departments designed to make officialformation even more generally available.   The working assumption now is that,^-ce Ministers have reached their conclusion on a particular major policy study,the associated factual and analytical material will be published unless Ministers^ve good reason for deciding otherwise.The Government believes that this initiative represents an important strideupward in freedom of government information.   But it is too soon to attempt a considered assessment of the results of so recent a development.These arrangements do not go as far as the legislative action that has been^en in a few foreign countries, notably the USA and Sweden. The Government has^turally been concerned to examine the practice in these countries.^* The US Freedom of Information Act provides that any person is entitled to&quot;c*ss to all US Government agency records except to the extent that the record,Part of it, is exempt.   There are nine exemptions covering roughly
&quot;classified&quot; defence and foreign relations information; limited kinds of purelyinternal matters such as personnel rules and practices; matters exempted &quot;by various other statutes; trade secrets; privileged intra-govemmental documents;personal files, the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy; law enforcement investigations, the supervision of financial institutions; and geological and geophysical information on oil wells,47. In Sweden, the Freedom of the Press Act - first introduced as part of theConstitution in 1766 - incorporates the right of free access to public documents.Official documents may he inspected on their arrival at or despatch from public offices and may be seen in public offices.   Again there are exceptions which are all detailed in the Secrecy Act; they relate to national security, foreign relations,criminal matters, private financial matters and information concerning the personalintegrity and safety of individuals.   There is also an exception for &quot;workingpapers&quot; prepared by an authority for the purpose of reaching a decision.48. The exemptions and exceptions in these provisions, it will be remarked, coverat least as wide a range of matters as that to which legislation to reform section 2of the Official Secrets Act, as proposed in this White Paper, would apply. Outsidethose matters, these two Acts clearly put a great deal of official informationinto the public domain in the countries in question.   Eut the operation of systems of this kind presents considerable resource problems.   In his report in 1977, thetTS Deputy Attorney General said that, in the Department of Justice alone, 607,000ran hours were spent in handling requests in one year.   In the Department of State,the requests in the same year covered nearly half a million pages of documents. Intheir Green paper legislation on Public Access to Government Documents&apos; theCanadian Government estimate the cost of operating the US Act to be in excess of^150,000,000 a year, excluding the costs of judicial review.49. Other criticisms, though of a more speculative nature, have been made of thet&apos;S Act.   Journalists are thought to have found the legislation of limited useCocause the administrative machinery is often too slow to cope with the short dead-lines to which they work.   Nor is the Act immune from the possibility of^nipulation for purposes not in the mind of its promoters: corporations are thought to use it with the objective of stalling or harassing regulatory agencies orPeking- proprietary information developed by competitors.   Furthermore, there has^en conflict between the Freedom of Information Act and the US Act on privacy.It is clear that the Swedish and American Acts are much more limited in theirf
scope than is sometimes supposed, with exceptions to cover much of what theGovernment is &quot;being pressed to expose in this country; and even where the AmericanAct does apply it presents very considerable difficulty, partly over cost and theamount of litigation to which it gives rise, but also over delay in administering the machinery.   &quot;Fbcperience in both countries suggests that we should see whetherthe benefits which they have obtained by legislation could in our circumstances beobtained as effectively and more cheaply by enlightened administration and thesensible use of discretion.   The Government proposes to continue to pursue thepossibilities of progress by these means, carrying forward and building on what has already been achieved, and ccnsiders that the time to reach conclusions on whether a legislative system could have a part to play or is needed in thiscountry, and could be intrcduced without excessive costs and other disadvantages,will be when legislation to reform section 2 of the 1911 Act has taken effect and has had a chance to influence the attitudes of the public service on theseratters.CCTCIDSION51. It is widely agreed that section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 shouldbe replaced.   This White Paper has explained the new legislation, broadly basedon the Franks report, which the Government have in mind.   It would depart fromthe Franks Committee1s proposals in some important respects.   The criminal lawwould not apply to the disclosure of information about the currency and reservesor of Cabinet documents; and greater protection than the Committee recommendedwould be given to information about individuals and private firms.52. The proposals for legislation raise many points of principle and some verytechnical points.   The Government wants to see public discussion of all theproposals and will take full account of the comments it receives.53. The reform of section 2 will help to dispel the belief that the Governmentand its servants are wedded to secrecy for its own sake.   Good government requiressome things to be kept secret, and this is so whether or not the information isProtected by the criminal law.   Put it is equally important that citizens should know what their Government is doing and why it is doingit.   This Government wants to create an atmosphere in which the flow of communication between the Governmentand the public is broadened and increased, and.in which confidence in theMachinery of government can be encouraged.   The reform of section 2 will be a
*** to that end, heoause it will delimit the area in whioh nnauthorxsed**We needs to he subject to criminal sanctions; hut there is a need, to of-Positive aotion, and the White Paper desorihes the steps that have been,and*exng, taken.   The White Paper has set out to desorihe in some detail howGovernment would reform section 2, hut it has also explained some of theAcuities that would lie in the way of adopting freedom of informationleeislation on American or Swedish lines.%-   The Government is not persuaded that such legislation is needed in this^try to achieve the purposes envisaged for it, or that it could he xntroaucedacceptable limits of cost and other disadvantages.   It welcomes, however,^Wnuing informed public dehate about ways in whioh the flow of Government^nation can he developed and increased so as to serve the ends of gooddemocratic government; and it will continue its policy of making more offxcxal^txon available.   It is confident that the new arrangements described in*ra^h   k3    MiU, as they take effect on policy studies within Whxtehall,I*0Ve a substantial contribution to that policy.
277  It should be an offence under the Official Information Ac -a. for a Crown servant to communicate informationfte^which the Actapplies, contrary to his official duty;b. for a Government contractor or a persc-tf entrusted with official information in confidence to communicate information of one of the kinds in paragraph 276 a., b. and c^otherwise than for the purposesof the contract or for which it was entrusted;c. for any person to communicate information of one of the kinds inparagraph 276 a., b. and^, which he knows, or has reasonable groundto believe, has reaphed him as the result of a contravention of theOfficial Infornu^ron Act;d. to communicate or use official information of any kind for purposesof priy^rc gain.^josccu^ons should require the consent of the Attorney General in the case^[jpforniation of the kinds mentioned in paragraph 276 a., c. and d., and^Pnhe Director of Public Prosecutions in the case of b. and of private gain.SPECIFIC proposals the replacement of section 21 Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 should be repealed, and replaced by narrower and more specific provisions.(Chapter 7, i.c. paragraphs 88-100.)I The new provisions which we recommend, in place of section 2, should form a separate statute, to be known as the Official Information Act.Paragraphs 101-3.)formation to which the Official Information Act should apply: defence, foreign relations, currency.3 Wencc and internal security. The Official Information Act should applyto official information relating to matters which concern or affect thedefence or security of the realm, including in particular those mattersset out in the subparaeraphs below. Information relating to the defenceor security of allied Powers, covering matters of the kind mentioned in^paragraphs a. to f. (but not g.), should be included in this catcgory:-a- the Armed Forces of the Crown and matters relating thereto;b. military weapons, stores and equipment of all kinds, includingnuclear weapons, ships, aircraft, vehicles, communications systems and all means of warfare;
d. defence policy and strategy and other military planning, includingplans and measures for the maintenance of essential supplies and services in the event of war;c. intelligence and security services, and information obtained by them;f. military treaties and arrangements with other Powers, and negotiationsof such treaties and arrangements;g. internal defence and security, and plans and measures relatingthereto, including plans and measures for the maintenance andrestoration of public order or of essential supplies and services incontingencies short of war.(Paragraphs 122-5.)4 foreign relations. The Official Information Act should apply to official information relating to any matters which concern or affect foreign relations or the conduct of foreign relations. By &quot;foreign relations&quot; wemean the relations between the United Kingdom Government and anyother Power or any international body the members of which arcgovernments.Paragraphs 126-134.)Currency and the reserves. The Official Information Act should applyto official information relating to any proposals, negotiations or decisionsconnected with alterations in the value of sterling, or relating to the reserves, including their extent or any movement in or threat to them.(Paragraphs 135-9.)Provisions on classification^ The Official Information Act should apply to official information withinthe three categories described in proposals 3, 4 and 5 above if it has beenclassified, in accordance with the provisions of proposal 7 below, on theground that its unauthorised disclosure would cause at least serious injury10 the interests of the nation. The prosecution should have to satisfy thecourt that the information fell within a category, and that it was so classified,but the court should not be concerned with the effect of the disclosure onthe interests of the nation.^aragraphs 147-9.)The Official Information Act should contain the following further provisionsQn classification:-a. Information should count as &quot;classified&quot; within the meaning of theAct if-i. in the case of a document, it is marked with the word SECRETor words including the word SECRET, or it relates to militaryweapons or equipment (as defined in proposal 3 b. and c.) andit is marked DEFENCE-CONFIDENTIAL, and in cithercase it has been classified in accordance with the provisionsof the Act and of regulations on classification made under it;
ii. in the case of a communication by non-documentary means,the information relates to the contents of a document which is classified in accordance with i., or is information which, if ithad been contained in a document, ought to have been soclassified.b. The Secretary of State should make regulations about the classificationand declassification of documents, which should include provisions on levels of authority at which decisions on classification may betaken and on arrangements for review and dcclassification.c. The unauthorised removal of a classification mark, or the making of a copy of a classified document without the mark, should not affect the classified status of that document.(Paragraphs 150-7.)8 Before a decision is taken whether to institute a prosecution for the disclosure of classified information within one of the three categories, there should bea review of the classification of the information which had allegedly been disclosed without authority. This review should be carried out by the responsible Minister himself. He should be required to consider whether,at the time of the alleged disclosure, that information was properly classifiedSECRET or above or DEFENCE CONFIDENTIAL, in the sense thatits unauthorised disclosure would cause serious injury to the interests ofthe nation. If he was not satisfied on this point, then no prosecutionwould be possible. If he was satisfied, he should give a certificate to that effect to the court. This certificate should be conclusive evidence of thefact that the information was classified within the meaning of the Act.All other ingredients of the offence should be proved by evidence in theusual way.(Paragraphs 158-161.)9 The Government, and the representatives of the news media and of anyother interests directly affected, should enter into discussions with aview to the establishment of an informal Committee on classification ofthe kind outlined in paragraphs 165-6 of the Reportparagraphs 163-6.)Other information to which the Official Information Act should apply10 Maintenance of law and order. The Official Information Act should applyto official information (including police, prison and Post Office information)which comes within one of the three following descriptions: a. it is likely to be helpful in the commission of offences;b. it is likely to be helpful in facilitating an escape from legal custody orother acts prejudicial to prison security;c. its disclosure would be likely to impede the prevention or detectionof offences or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders.(Chapter 10, i.e. paragraphs 170-5.)
W TJie Cabinet. The Official Information Act should apply to cabinet documents, that is. documents submitted for the consideration of theCabinet and documents recording the proceedings or conclusions of theCabinet, irrespective of subject matter. &quot;Cabinet&quot; for this purpose includescommittees of the Cabinet the members of which arc Ministers. cabinet documents to which the Act applies should be marked in a mannerprescribed by the Secretary of the Cabinet. The Act should provide that the communication of a Cabinet document means cither the trans-nussion of that document or a substantial part of it, or the communication of information about the document by other means which enable another person to reproduce the document or a substantial part of it in verbatim orvirtually verbatim form. The provisions in proposal 7 c. about theremoval of a classification mark, or the making of a copy of a classifieddocument without the mark, should apply also to Cabinet marks.paragraphs 182-190.)12 77*ne confidences of the citizen.  The Official Information Act should apply to information given to the Government by private individuals or concerns, whether given by reason of compulsory powers or otherwise,and whether or not given on an express or implied basis of confidence,paragraphs 192-200.)^ Official information used for private gain. The Official Information Actshould contain the following provisions, which would in effect form anextension of the existing law on corruption: a- It should be an offence for a Crown servant, contrary to his officialduty, to use official information for the purpose of obtaining privategain for himself or any other person, or to communicate the informa-tion to any other person with a view to enabling that person or anyother person to obtain private gain. &quot;Private gain&quot; means themaking of a gain, or the avoidance of a loss, in money or moncy&apos;sworth.D- This offence should also cover i- a Government contractor who uses or communicates official information for private gain, otherwise than for the purposes ofthe contract;u. a person entrusted with official information in confidence, whouses or communicates that information for private gain, otherwise than for the purposes for which it was entrusted.C It should be an offence for a recipient of official information, whichhe knows or has reasonable ground to believe has been disclosed bya Crown servant contrary to his official duty, or by a Governmentcontractor or person entrusted with ofikial information in confidencecontrary to b. above, to use that information for the purpose ofrp obtaining private gain for himself or for another.V aragraPhs 201-5.)
Who should be liable to prosecution14  The Official Information Act should place the primary duty to protectofficial information to which it applies upon: a. Ministers of the Crown;b. members of the Home Civil Service and the Diplomatic Service;c members of the Armed Forces;d. members of police forces;e. members of the Atomic Energy Authority and the Post Office;f. persons employed by or serving under the direction or control ofany of the above classes, and members of the legal profession acting for the Crown or for the police in bringing prosecutions;g. former members of any of the above classes,paragraphs 208-215.)Crown servants*5  It should be an offence for a Crown servant to communicate information to which the Official Information Act applies, contrary to his official duty,paragraphs 216-7.)^ In relation to prosecutions of serving Crown servants for the offence inproposal 15, the Official Information Act should provide as follows: a. The prosecution should have to prove that the Crown servant haddisclosed information to which the Official Information Act applies,contrary to his official duty.b. The Crown servant should have the defence that he believed, andhad reasonable ground to believe, that he was not acting contraryto his official duty.c. The Crown servant should also have the defence that i. in the case of classified information relating to defence orinternal security, or foreign relations, or the currency or the reserves, he did not know, and had no reason to believe, thatit was classified;ii. in the case of an offence of disclosing a Cabinet document, or information covered by our proposals on the maintenance oflaw and order and the confidences of the citizen, he did not know, and had no reason to believe, that it was such a document,or was information of one of the kinds specified in proposals 10and 12.Paragraphs 218-221.)^ Failure by a Crown servant to take reasonable care of an official document0r information to which the Official Information Act applies, or failure to comply with directions given on behalf of the Crown about the return0r disposal of such a document, or the retention of such a documentcontrary to his official duty, should be offences.Paragraph 222.)1061 ,W- -mm
Government contractors and persons entrusted with official information inconfidence18 a. It should be an offence for a Government contractor to discloseinformation to which the Official Information Act applies (otherthan the confidences of the citizen) and which has come into his possession owing to his position as a Government contractor if i. the provisions of the Act have been drawn to his attention as applying to that information or that kind of information; and ii. the disclosure is not made for the purposes of the contract or inaccordance with an authorisation given on behalf of the Crown,or it is made contrary to restrictions imposed on behalf of theCrown.b. A person charged with this offence should have the defences i. that he believed, and had reasonable ground to believe, thathe had disclosed the information for the purposes of the contract,or in accordance with an authorisation given on behalf of theCrown, or that the disclosure was not contrary to any restrictionimposed on behalf of the Crown;ii. that he did not know, and had no reason to believe, that theinformation in question was classified, or was of a kind protected by the Official Information Act (see proposal 16 c).c. This offence should also cover a person entrusted with official information in confidence by a Crown servant, with the modificationthat a. ii. and b. ;. should refer to the purposes for which the infor-mation was entrusted and not to the purposes of the contract.d. The offences of failing to take reasonable care of official documents and information and failing to comply with directions for the returnor disposal of such documents (sec proposal 17) should also applyto Government contractors and persons entrusted with official information in confidence.(Chapter 14, i.e. paragraphs 223-8.)The duty of the citizen19 The mere receipt of official information should no longer be an offence.(Paragraphs 232-3.)20 Where a person knows, or has reasonable ground to believe, that informa-tion in his possession has been communicated (whether or not directly to him) in contravention of the Official Information Act (other than theprovisions relating to the confidences of the citizen and private gain) itshould be an offence for him to communicate that information otherwisec than in accordance with an authorisation given on behalf of the Crown.&quot;The prosecution should have to prove (a) that there had been a contra-vention of the Act by some other person, and (b) that the information inquestion was still covered by the Act at the time when the accused com-rnunicatcd it, and (c) that the accused knew that the information had atsome earlier stage been communicated in contravention of the Act, or
that he had reasonable ground to believe that this was the case. the accused should have the defence that he believed, and had reasonableground to believe, that he had communicated the information in accord-ance with an authorisation given on behalf of the Crown to him, or givento some other person but in terms applicable to him.
