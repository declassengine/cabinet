;umentIS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 65*9 June 1978cabinetCOPY NO   g QREFORM OF SECTION 2 OF THE official secrets ACT 1911:  DRAFT WHITE paper note by the Secretary of State for the Home department on 25 May (CM(78) 20th Conclusions, Minute 6) the Cabinet invited me to prepare a revised version of the White Paper, in consultation withthe Lord Privy Seal, after I had seen the National Executive Committee (NEC)deputation.2&apos; I saw the NEC deputation on 13 June.    They brought with them the text of an &quot;Access to Information Bill&quot;, and the gist of what they at firsthad to say was that if the Government was unwilling to go far enough to meet them on access to information, they would prefer us to do nothing at all onthe reform of Section 2.    However, I think they saw the force of the argument that reform of Section 2 was a necessary precursor to the further development of openness in government.On 15 June the House of Commons debated the Official Secrets Act,at the choice of the Opposition.    The general approach indicated in thePrevious paragraph was vbiced by some of our back-benchers. TheOpposition front bench touched on access to information very lightly. TheLiberal spokesman put great weight on it.   The Minister of State, Home0*fice (Mr. Brynmor John) repeated our commitment to a White Paper onSection 2 and indicated that the Government, while having an open mind onfarther developments in access to information, regarded the reform ofSection 2 as the necessary immediate step.Against all this background, and guided by the  Cabinet1 s conclusions0* 25 May, I have prepared the attached paragraphs to replaceParagraphs 39-54 of the text circulated with my memorandum CP(78) 61.I now invite my colleagues to agree that the White Paper, so amended,8 hould be published as soon as possible.M RHome Officel9 June 1978
DRAFT WHITE PAPEROPEN GOVERNMENT39, This W^ite Paper is about the reform of section 2 of theOfficial Secrets Act 1911.    Strictly speaking, questions.of opengovernment do not depend on section 2, which is concerned only withthe information that needs to be protected from unauthorised dis-closure by criminal sanctions, and not with increasing the output ofinformation whose disclosure is authorised.     Nevertheless, the franks report suggested in paragraph 68 that there was some link between the two topics and that section 2 had some effect in creating a general aura of secrecy.    Even if section 2 is reformed, and the range of information protected by criminal sanctions is narrowed asProposed in this White Paper, there will remain some especially-sensitive areas which will have to continue to be protected, includinginformation whose unauthorised disclosure would be an unwarrantableinvasion of the privacy of the individual.    None the less, theGovernment accepts that section 2 in its present form, because ofits very wide ambit, does have some inhibiting effect on openness ingovernment, and has this consideration much in mind in proposingreform of section 2.    It is in no doubt that that reform is a nece-ssary preliminary to the degree of openness in government which we want to achieve.40. Government departments already make public, or make available on request, a great deal of information;    both factual and statisticaln&amp;terial and documents setting out the reasoning and analysis behindGovernment policies and decisions.    The volume of information madeavailable has been increasing substantially over recent years. Thereis a wide range of regular and ad hoc HMSO and departmental publi-cations, and Departments respond to many requests direct from^searchers and members of the public.     To the traditional white papers have been added an ever-increasing flow of Green Papers andother consultative documents.    In our system of government theExecutive is under continuous scrutiny by Parliament, and Members ofCONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL -
tCONFIDENTIAL- 2 -Parliament have a variety of means and opportunities for seekinginformation about Government policies and actions.   Much information is given to Parliament, in answers to questions, in speeches, inevidence to Select Committees, and indeed in letters to Members ofParliament.41.     It is settled Government policy to continue to expand the flow of information to Parliament and the public, in particular insetting out the background to major policy decisions.    In July 1977the Head of the Home Civil Service issued, with the approval of thePrime Minister, instructions to departments designed to make official information even more generally available.    Since that time all departments have been increasing the volume and range of informationftade available.    To take only one example, there is what is nowbeing done in the field of road planning.   The Report on the Reviewof Highway Procedures / Cmnd. 1133/   set out in some detailwhat is now done to meet the increasing demand for more and betterinformation about road plans.    The presumption now is that theevidence available to Departments will be accessible to objectors andthe public, except where its release might be damaging to individuals.The instructions,issued in July 1977, which will need time to achieve their full effect, do not mean that all announcements of government decisions will or should be accompanied by an appendix of supportingdepartmental papers:    for instance, when an announcement follows thePublication of a White Paper or the report of a committee of inquiry,that document is likely itself to provide a full background to thedecisions.   But the working assumption is now that, once Ministers^ve reached their conclusion on a particular major policy study,associated factual and analytical material will be published un-*ess Ministers have good reason for deciding otherwise.^2.. So the Government accepts an obligation to publish as muchlnformation as it feasibly can, and will continue to develop its^actice accordingly.   The question is whether to go further,create a statutory right of access to information, on the lines0^ the legislation in force in some other countries, notably in the^ited States and Sweden.nnmnnrntinf
CONFIDENTIAL- 3 -43. The U.S. Freedom of Information Act provides that any person is entitled to access to all U.S. Government agency records except to the extent that the record, or part of it, is exempt.    There arenine exemptions covering roughly &quot;classified&quot; defence and foreign relations information;    limited kinds of purely internal matters;matters exempted by various other statutes;    trade secrets; privilegedintra-governmental documents;    personal or other similar files,the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion ofprivacy;    law enforcement investigations;    the supervision offinancial institutions;    and geological and geophysical information on oil wells.44. In Sweden, the Freedom of the Press Act - first introduced as part of the Constitution in 1766 - incorporates the right of free access to the documents of public agencies.    Such documentsmay be inspected on their arrival at or despatch from public offices and may be seen in public offices.    Again there are exceptions whichare all detailed in the Secrecy Act;    they relate to national security, foreign relations, criminal matters, private financial matters and information concerning the personal integrity and safety of individuals.    There is also an exception for &quot;working papers&quot;prepared by an authority for the purpose of reaching a decision.45. Legislation on these lines would of course completely change the nature of the Governments obligations:    instead of acceptinga declared obligation to make available as much information asit feasibly can, operating on a voluntary and discretionary basis,the Government would be under a statutory duty to disclose alland any information that might be demanded, unless it wasspecifically exempted from doing so.   There would have to beexemptions and exceptions, as there are in the U.S. and Swedishlegislation:    it will indeed be remarked that the exemptions andexceptions in those provisions cover at least as wide a rangeQf matters as that to which legislation to reform section 2 of theOfficial Secrets Act, as proposed in this White Paper, would apply.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL- 4 -46. United States experience suggests that there would be considerable resource costs:    in its Green Paper legislation on Public Access to Government Documents1 the Canadian Governmentestimates the cost of operating the U.S. Act to be in excess of$150,000,000 a year, excluding the costs of judicial review.47. Perhaps more fundamentally, it is at least for considerationhow far the analogy from foreign experience should be pressed.In order to achieve the reasonable objectives of open governmentin the British context, where the policies and decisions of theExecutive are under constant and vigilant scrutiny by Parliamentend Ministers are directly answerable in Parliament, it may be neither necessary nor desirable to proceed to legislation of a kind and to incur costs of a magnitude which may be justifiable in other and often very different contexts - for instance, that of the UnitedStates.48. This is a matter on which the Government has come to noconclusion and has an open mind.    First, however, we regard the reform of section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 on the lines set out in this White Paper as a necessary precursor of any furtherstatutory changes, as well as of improvements of attitudes in thepublic service.    Secondly, we shall continue to develop the practice of0pen government on the lines and in the directions of recent changes.Thirdly, we need to extend our understanding of overseas analogiesand experience, so that there can be more fully informed study and discussion of these matters in this country.   The Government willke ready to contribute to this study and discussion.    But it remainstoe case that, however far the practice of open government may be developed or the law on access to information changed, there willremain some categories of information - including information whosedisclosure would invade individual privacy - which cannot and^ould not be disclosed, and which will need to be protected not only byCriminal sanctions against unauthorised disclosure but also by?*emption from any obligation, statutory or otherwise, to publish on&quot;request.
