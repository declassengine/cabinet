The 10th Report of the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) making recommendations about the pay of senior civil servants, members of the armed Forces, the Judiciary and Nationalised Industry Board members(NIBMs) has now been submitted.2. The main recommendations can be summarised as:-a. New pay scales some 31 per cent on average above thoserecommended in 1974 (in TSRB-6) &quot;should be paid with effect from1 April 1978&quot;.    Details of the recommended rates are set out inthe Annex.    Because not all of the 1974 recommendations have beenfully implemented (in the case of the NIBMs not implemented at allso that their present pay is still essentially based on 1969 ratesupdated in 1972), the weighted average of the recommended increasesover the salaries currently being paid are:  Senior Civil Service -33.7 per cent; Armed Forces - 34. 4 per cent; Judiciary - 34.3 percent;  NIBMs - 44.7 per cent.    The overall weighted average increase is 35. 0 per cent.b. The increases, if staged - &quot;in not more than three stages&quot; -should reach &quot;the full recommended levels not later than April 1980&quot;.c. The current recommendations should be &quot;brought up to date by the normal review process in the intervening period&quot;.d. The new pay scales should be introduced immediately &quot;in fullfor pensions purposes&quot;.1
*&quot;        In addition to the special position of the NIBMs, about a quarter ofthose covered by the Report have not yet received the full award madeunder the TSRB-6 Report in December 1974.    The Attorney General hasadvised that those concerned in the Civil Service - but not the Armed Forces -Probably have an enforceable legal right to payment of the second stage ofthat award.    Although the Attorney General has not specifically advised on^r case the Judiciary probably have a legal claim at least as strong as thatof the civil servants.    In the case of the Civil Service this right would arise from 1 January 1978 and in the case of the Judiciary from 1 January 1977.The lack of a similar right in the Armed Forces appears to be an historicalaccident on which it would be unsafe to rely in the modern courts.THE ISSUES FOR DECISION^&apos; The Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy, Sub-Committeeon Pay Negotiations (EY(P)) has discussed the Report.    Our aim was not toreach agreed recommendations but to clarify the issues for colleagues.There are eight such issues.    These are:-a. Should the recommended salary scales be accepted in principle?The argument for this course is that we appointed the Review body and asked them to advise us.    Having done so, and in the light ofour reaction to the similar reports from the Doctors and Dentistsand Armed Forces Review Bodies we would be on very weak ground in refusing to accept the advice offered.    Almost all of those present at the Sub-Committee meeting thought that acceptance in principle was inevitable despite the very large percentage increases this wouldinvolve for some individuals especially in the nationalised industries.b. Should the recommended salary scales be adopted now for pensions purposes?    There are three arguments in favour of this.First the Review Body has recommended it;  second we have adoptedthis procedure in respect of the recommendations of the other ReviewBodies;  and, third, unless we do so for senior staff the pensionentitlements of those below them in the salary scale will rapidlyovertake theirs and create new anomalies.    It was, however, pointedout that we have not yet adopted this course in respect of unversity teachers so that nc question of principle is involved. Myunderstanding of the university teachers&apos; position is, however, thatthe overwhelming majority of them have the alternative protection of inland Revenue Circular No. 12 so that questions of notional salarydo not arise.c. Should we accept the TSRB recommendation that the stagingof implementation of the present award should be completed by1 April 1980?    There are three arguments for this course: it hasbeen strongly recommended by the Review Body; it accords with thetreatment we have agreed for both Doctors and Dentists&apos; and Armed
forces settlements;  and it provides a possible quid pro quo for asatisfactory settlement on the &quot;legal entitlements&quot; discussed below.As against this, there is the view that highly paid groups should not receive such big increases at the same speed as the rest of theworkforce;  and that there may be a link with whatever we may decide to do about pay policy in the coming year including any possiblearrangements for dealing with anomalies in the private sector.d. Should the first stage be one of 10 per cent in this round?EY(P) was virtually unanimous in agreeing that we should offer10 per cent, but not more than 10 per cent, to all of those concernedin the present round.    This need not exclude the operation of a &quot;kittyprinciple&quot; if for other reasons this seems desirable.e. Should we accept the Report&apos;s recommendation that theproposed rates of pay should be &quot;brought up to date by the normalreview process&quot; during the staging period?    Again this is a practice which we have accepted in respect of the Doctors and Dentists&apos; and armed Forces&apos; Review Body recommendations and is recommended in TSRB-10.    We have also adopted a somewhat similar approach inthe case of the firemen, and are likely to do so in the case of thepolice.    Alternative views expressed in the Sub-Committee were on the one hand that unless some such procedure was adopted, wewould simply create a new anomaly which would cause trouble infuture and on the other, that we needed to take into account, and avoid prejudicing, the success of the general pay policies we mayadopt for the next round.f. Should special arrangements be made for the NIBMs?There is no doubt that the history of the NIBMs pay issue has createdan awkward situation and is having adverse effects both onrecruitment to, and the operation of, our major nationalised industries.    As the Sub-Committee saw it, the question is notwhether, but how, the position could best be corrected.    On the onehand, it may be that a firm commitment both to quantum and timing of the staging process will serve our purposes.    There is however acase for inserting a special bias into the system in favour of theNIBMs, perhaps by differential staging.    Such a bias, if adopted,would have to take effect from next year because the Sub-Committeewere quite clear that the right course in the present pay round wasto give the NIBMs 10 per cent - subsuming as necessary the5-10 per cent increase we agreed in March (CM(78) 8th Conclusions,Minute 4).g. What should be done about the possible legal right of somecivil servants and members of the Judiciary to payment of thewithheld part of the 1974 award?    The existence of these legalcommitments is a fact which we must take into account in deciding3
our attitude to the Report as a whole. It also bears on the dateof implementation of a 10 per cent settlement this year. three courses are open to us:-i. To offer 10 per cent to all concerned from1 January this year and persuade those with residual legalclaims - particularly the Judges - to forgo them.    Such a date would accord with the present settlement dates of those concerned with the exception of the High Court Judges whohave July dates.    It need not conflict with the report s (much higher) recommended rates for April this year.    If weadopted this course we would then move to an April settlementdate through the staging process.ii. To offer 10 per cent from 1 April this year either as a straight addition to pay (without any more to meet legalentitlements) or as a kitty or kitties from which any legalentitlements would be paid at the expense of others without such entitlement.iii. To pay the legal entitlements from their due datesplus topping up to 10 per cent where appropriate from1 April.h. The first course minimises the difficulty of the legalentitlements by reducing the size and content of outstanding claims and accords broadly with existing pay dates; the second maximisesthe difficulty of accommodating the legal claims and might well notbe acceptable to those concerned.    It would also further reduce thepayments made to NIBMs in this round;  and the third would breachpay policy.i. What should be done about consequentials?    The present report covers directly about 690 members of the higher Judiciary,150 NIBMs (excluding flat rate part-time members), 240 senior officers in the Armed Forces, and about 970 civil servants. Thereare, however, in addition some 315 members of public boards,together with about 850 staff in the Civil Service and controlled fringebodies whose pay is adjusted consequentially with the TSRB groupsdirectly covered in the Report.    The Sub-Committee did not discussthe treatment of consequentials, but the simplest course, following the example in the main Civil Service settlement earlier this year,would be to allow them to follow the main groups according to their traditional pay relationships.    We shall also have to consider the subsidiary issue of the payments to be made to flat rate part-time members of the boards of nationalised industries which is also dealtwith in the Report.
