HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(78) 51 (Revise) COPY NO3 May 1978CABINETINDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY:  EXTENT OF UNIONISATIONNote by the Secretary of the Cabinet1. At their meeting on 27 April (CM^78) 16th Conclusions, Minute 4)I was instructed by the Cabinet to provide information about the extent ofunionisation in companies employing 500 or more employees.2. There is no firm information on the distribution of unionmembership by size of firm or by size of establishment.    The best available evidence suggests however that establishment size is a criticaldeterminant of unionisation.    The larger the establishment the more likelyit is to be unionised.    Unionisation in all manufacturing industry was62. 2 per cent in 1974.    It is estimated that unionisation in manufacturingestablishments employing over 200 people averages 89.2 per cent. Itseems reasonable to assume that the percentage will be higher still in manufacturing establishments with over 500 employees.3. Information about the density of unionisation by industry variesconsiderably.    Excluding a number of industries which are dominated bysmall firms (agriculture, forestry, fishing, distribution, construction andcertain services) and manufacturing firms employing fewer than 200 workers,the average level of unionisation has been estimated at 81.2 per cent.4. All these figures derive from work by Professor Bain of the SocialSciences Research Council Industrial Relations Unit and relates to 1974.It wa6 the data drawn on in paragraphs 12-14 of the Bullock Report.5. It should however be noted that the figures quoted in paragraph above include establishments in the nationalised industries, where thereis an overwhelming degree of unionisation, and relate to establishments notcompanies.    The average percentage of unionisation in private sectorcompanies will be correspondingly lower.1
6. Moreover, although the non-manufacturing industries referred toin paragraph 3 above do include a large number of small firms, some ofthem - such as construction, banking, insurance and distribution - do also include a considerable number of large companies, and specificallycompanies with employees in the 500-2, 000 range;  and there is a markedtendency for these companies to have a relatively low degree of unionisation7. It is impossible to draw any firm conclusions from all this.However, taking the Bullock figure of 70 per cent for companies with over2, 000 employees in the private sector, and an average density for smallercompanies of 20 per cent, the average density for companies employing500 to 1, 000 may be around 40 per cent or 50 per cent.    There would ofcourse be very large sectoral variations around this figure and a substantialdifference between white collar and blue collar density.8. All these figures and estimates must, however, be treated withreservation.Signed   JOHN hunt cabinet Office3 May 19782
