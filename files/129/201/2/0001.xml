^HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S government cp(78) 52 COPY no May 1978CABINETCHILD BENEFIT AND CHILD TAX ALLOWANCES FOROLDER CHILDRENMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Services and theChief Secretary, treasury. The Cabinet decided on 4 April (CM(78) 11th Conclusions, Minute 1)that child benefit should be increased by 70p from November 1978, as thefirst instalment of an increase to  4 from April 1979.    The decision was presented in these terms in the Budget statement in order to avoid the april 1979 increase appearing too small to offset the phasing out of childtax allowances (CTAu) at that point.2. The Cabinet deferred, however, a decision on whether CTAs for children over 11 as well as those for children under 11 should be withdrawnin April 1979.    It would now be helpful to settle this.    Withdrawal of theCTAs for older children will:-i. substantially complete the phasing-in of child benefit;ii. save 800 staff for the Inland Revenue and enable them to plan ahead more firmly;iii. reduce the net Exchequer cost of the child benefit increasein 1979-80 by some  50 million.3. It is also essential to settle this question because we shall be pressed to state more precisely the net gain to families from the benefit increase and tax reductions in April 1979-   In doing so we shall need to present thetwo increases as part of one package.    As CP(78) 29 explained, the increaseof  1 to  4 in April 1979 will not in itself be enough to cover losses sufferedthen in respect of children over 16 through withdrawal of CTAs, and a minority of children over 11 of parents whose housing benefits are reducedas a result of the child benefit increase.    But taking the November and Aprilincrease together, as in the Budget presentation, will give an overall gainto all families paying tax at the basic rate.1
4. Withdrawal of the CTAs for older children will also remove thepresent small elemsnt of age relation in general family support since therewill be a flat rate of child benefit for children of all ages.    We made itclear during the passage of the Child Benefit Act that the full child benefitscheme would be launched with the best possible flat rate, subsuming theCTAs for children of all ages.    But this does not inhibit us for the future.From April 1980 we shall have the capacity to pay age-related child benefit and we shall be weighing the arguments for and against this carefully.We should recognise, however, that whilst the main argument for agerelation, that older children cost more to keep, is well understood, thereis less general understanding of the distributional advantages of a flat rate.The most expensive child is not the one which costs most to feed and clothe;it is the young child for whom the mother stays at home and thus deprivesthe family of its second earner.    Older children also tend to be not only intwo-earner families but in families where the main earner&apos;s job is betterpaid as he or she has advanced up the earnings ladder.conclusion. We therefore seek the Cabinet1 s agreement that CTAs for childrenover 11 should be withdrawn in April 1979 together with those for children under 11, and that a suitable opportunity should be taken to announce this.D EJ BDepartment of Health and Social Security4 May 19782
