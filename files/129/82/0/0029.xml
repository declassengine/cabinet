secret.P.(56) 17919th July, 1956COPY NO.CABINETAUSTRALIAN TRADE TALKS: WHEATMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and FoodoThe Australian demand for special measures of assistance on wheat is in the following terms:-&quot;An engagement by United Kingdom to ensureannual sale to the United Kingdom of wheat or flour of,say, 40 million bushels wheat equivalent (the averageof pre-war wheat/flour sales to this country) whenprice quoted is competitive with normal commercial(non-subsidised) competitive capacity of alternativesuppliers&quot;.2. This demand for a restoration of their pre-war place in our market - notwithstanding the great change in our own agricultural production and in the world wheat supply position - could only be met bythe adoption of one or a combination of the following measures:-(i)        the drastic and speedy curtailment of our own wheatproduction so as to return to the pre-war pattern of supplies;(ii)        the imposition of a tariff on wheat so as to give adecided preference to Commonwealth supplies;(iii)        the imposition of quotas on wheat imports so as to reserve a prescribed share of the imported supplies for Australia;(iv)       the imposition of detailed controls on flour millersand bakers to regulate the proportion of home grown and Australian wheat and flour used for flour millingand for the manufacture of flour products;(v) the return to Government bulk purchase of wheat and flour;(vi) the adoption of a deficiency payments system for australian wheat by which the United KingdomGovernment undertake to guarantee a prescribedprice to Australia;(vii)        the negotiation with the flour milling industry of anagreement whereby the millers undertake to buy a prescribed quantity of Australian wheat in return forGovernment financial compensation.-1 -
3.   Reduction in our own wheat acreageIt is our policy, in view of the Commonwealth surpluses ofwheat, to reduce the special incentives given to wheat production in thiscountry.    It would not be possible, however, politically or technicallyto make a violent reduction in our domestic wheat production on thescale which would be necessary to help the Australians.    The best wecould do is to tell the Australians that the policy of the Governmentremains as stated in the last White Paper, i.e. &quot;that there is no longer any special reason to justify exceptional encouragement for theproduction of wheat&quot;.4.   TariffsA tariff on foreign wheat would enable protection to be givento Australia without any detailed interference with day-to-day trading operations.    However, apart from the domestic political problems ofa &quot;tax on bread&quot; at a time when we are seeking to lower the cost ofliving, it is agreed that the imposition of a preferential tariff on wheatcould not be negotiated even if it were compatible with our internationaltrading obligations.5.   QuotasIt is agreed that the imposition of quotas on wheat imports would also be inconsistent with our international trading obligations.It would be a major reversal of our domestic policy and would bring toan end the present free trading system in wheat.     An elaborate licensing system would be involved and there would have to be further interferenceif fair allocation of the available supplies to the trade were to be assured.It would not be possible to limit these restrictions to the flour millingindustry.    They would extend to the animal feeding stuffs trade, since itis impossible to identify feed wheat as a separate commodity.6.   Detailed control of wheat and flour utilisationA system of control which sought to regulate the proportions of home grown and Australian wheat used by millers would involvedetailed interference in the day-to-day activities of the industry.    Itwould be necessary to extend the control to flour - otherwise bakers would increase their imports of flour to maintain the quality of their bread.If the system were to be at all effective it would involve far-reachingcontrols, including transport eqtialisation charges to ensure that the inlandmillers could maintain their competitive position.    I could not justifydetailed intervention of this character.7.   Return to Government bulk purchaseThis is the solution which would be most acceptable to the australians, since it provides the firm guarantee which they would like.It would be a major reversal of our policy.    It would be costly, sincethe Government would be &quot;dumpers&quot; of wheat in an otherwise freemarket.    I do not see how we could then avoid returning to theGovernment purchase of home-grown wheat.    The forced sales of australian wheat would depress the price of home-grown wheat and soincrease the cost of our home-grown wheat deficiency payments.    It isnot improbable that in order to save public funds the restoration ofbulk purchase in one sector might make it necessary for the Governmentagain to become the sole importer of all wheat.    Clearly this is something which we could not contemplate.
A scheme could be devised by which the United KingdomGovernment undertake to make a payment to guarantee the Australiansthe difference between an agreed guaranteed price and the average price realised on sales made to the United Kingdom market.  It/wouldinvolve the United Kingdom taxpayer guaranteeing a minimum price fora commodity which is in world surplus.    The payment would be in effectan export subsidy paid by the importing country.    It would be costly tothe Exchequer and would expose the Government to risks of recklessselling by the Australian Wheat Board.    If other countries tried tomaintain their place in the United Kingdom market by price cutting,such a scheme could be extremely costly.    It would be contrary to thespirit of our international obligations and to the general trade policieswe have so far pursued.    Export controls would presumably benecessary and it might well prove that more drastic measures ofcontrol would be required.9. It would also lead to renewed pressure for the extensionof a deficiency payments system to other commodities from commonwealth sources.    When the bulk purchase of butter and cheesewas abandoned, both Australia and New Zealand pressed for ascheme on these lines.    A concession now on wheat would reopen this approach.10.   A negotiated arrangement with the millersA final possibility might be to see if the millers could be persuaded - we have no power of compulsion - to undertake to buy annuallya specified quantity of Australian wheat.    It is impossible to convertsuch an agreement into a binding and enforceable commitment uponindividual millers.    It would certainly involve some financial arrange-ments with the millers to safeguard them against losses and also some protection against flour imports.    Even if it were possible to reachsuch an agreement with the millers, it has not proved possible to devisefinancial arrangements which would be defensible from the point ofview of public accounting.11,   The price fixing problem1Government bulk purchase, a deficiency payments scheme,and a negotiated agreement with the millers all involve reaching agree-ment with the Australians on the price of their wheat.    This will be amost difficult task and could lead to bitter negotiations unless we con-ceded the Australian price proposals.    It would be difficult for the australians to agree to sell at a price below the International wheat agreement (l.W ,A.) minimum price.    This is, from our point of view,unjustifiably high in view of the present world surplus.    At a time whenworld supply conditions justify lower prices for wheat - and other grains -it would be wrong for us to enter into commitments to support wheatprices at a high level.    Nevertheless, if the principle of an agreedprice is accepted, it will be difficult to avoid conceding a price equalto the Australian interpretation of the current I.W.A, minimum.Conclusion12, There are clearly the greatest objections to any concession on wheat that is practicable.
13. If a concession is to be made, in my opinion a deficiency round scheme with an upper limit on the quantity on which payment will be made and - if we can get it - a maximum financial liability isthe least objectionable course.14. I could not agree to any final commitment being accepted without an opportunity for consultation with the farming and trade interests concerned.H.A.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,S.W.1.,18th July, 1956.
