CP. (56) 1624th July, 1956CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME: 1956-57 session memorandum by the Lord Privy seal the Future Legislation Committee have recently completed, with the help of all Ministers whose Departmental interests are affected, a comprehensive reviewof the legislative programme for next Session.2. As a result, there are, at the moment, more Bills with claims of high priority than can be fitted into the time likely to be available for legislation. Thisis far from unusual at this stage in the preparation of the programme. But the calculation is additionally, and seriously, complicated this year by the possibility that the Cabinet may decide to introduce legislation for the reform of the Houseof Lords. Without prejudice to the decision on that point, the mere arithmeticof the programme stands as follows.3. So far as can be foreseen at present, the time likely to be available for legislation on the hypothesis of normal provision for Supply, the Finance Bill,Debates, &amp;c. should be about 45 days.4. The candidates for a place in the programme originally numbered about100. These have been reduced by careful scrutiny to the two lists annexed to thismemorandum.   List A consists of:(a) Those Bills for which the Ministers concerned can claim high priorityon grounds of major policy.(b) Those Bills which are contingent, in the sense that they may become essential in certain circumstances, whether by reason of developmentsoutside our control or as a result of policy decisions which we may take in the next few months. The contingent Bills are indicated by anasterisk.List B is a reserve list, comprising a selection of Bills of which some might beintroduced if time permits.5. The Bills in List A are estimated to demand about 60 or 70 days, accordingto whether they include, or exclude, a substantial Bill on House of Lords Reform.At this stage this estimate is, of course, only approximate. But it indicates:  (i) that the Bills in List A exceed the time likely to be available by about15 or 25 days, according to the hypothesis about Lords Reform. and merely to eliminate this excess will not suffice; we must provide also some extra margin for the unforeseeable contingencies, including thepossibility that the Death Penalty (Abolition) Bill may have to be given a second run next Session;50116Printed for the Cabinet.

(ii) that, in any case (i.e., even if the Cabinet decide not to introduce legislation for Lords Reform), a fairly substantial cut in List A will therefore benecessary; while, if a Bill to reform the Lords is to figure in next session&apos;s programme, an even more drastic surgical operation will haveto be performed on that List;(iii) that, while the candidates in List B will be accommodated within theprogramme to the extent which time permits, there can be no guarantee at present that any of them will be found a place.6. While the decision on Lords Reform must necessarily remain in abeyancefor the moment, I suggest that our best course would be to accept the Bills inLists A and B as a basis for planning, in the sense that all those Bills should be cleared, where necessary, with the Home Affairs Committee and the Treasury,and should be regarded as authorised candidates for purposes of drafting. Thefinal selection must wait until rather later in the year, i.e., until we approach theperiod in which the Queen&apos;s Speech has to be prepared. But, as against thepossibility that some fairly drastic cutting of List A may be necessary, I shouldvalue the views of my colleagues on the following possible candidates for the axe:(a) Agricultural Marketing and Guarantees Bill. The main purposes of this bill would appear to be to give permanent legislative form to variousarrangements which at present rest on emergency powers, and perhapsalso to give effect to whatever new policy on long-term assurances tothe farmers the Cabinet may finally approve. I suggest that the Billshould remain in the programme for the time being, without prejudice to a further scrutiny later in the year. I must emphasise, however,that it will not be easy to find time for this Bill.ib) The Electricity Bill (to give effect to some of the recommendations of theHerbert Report). In view of the political implications of any actionaffecting the fuel and power industries, the case for this Bill is being submitted separately, in the memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power, CP. (56) 164. As against the important considerations whichthe Minister sets out, it must be remembered that (i) In view of the new arrangements for financing the capital requirements of the nationalised industries, it will not be possible,for the time being, to take action on the recommendations ofthe Herbert Committee on the capital financing of the electricity industry; and that the Bill may be to that extent less attractive to our own back-benchers.(ii) A Bill on this subject might provoke a demand for legislation onthe structure and management of other nationalised industries,which might not be very opportune.(c) The Gowers Legislation. The Future Legislation Committee have taken note of three possible Gowers candidates Shops (Closing Hours);Health, Welfare and Safety in non-Industrial Employment; and factories (Railway Premises). Even on the most optimisticassumption, there is room for only one of these Bills in theprogramme; and the Committee have come to the conclusion that itshould be the Shops (Closing Hours) Bill both because it is the GowersBill to which the Government are most heavily committed, and because, unlike the other two Bills, it will impose no significant financial burden on the interests affected. But if the programme has to becompressed still further, are we prepared to sacrifice even the Shops(Closing Hours) Bill?(d) Betting and Gaming Bill. The Future Legislation Committee weredoubtful about the priority which should be given to this Bill. Butin view of the delay which has already occurred on the subject and theextent to which the Government are committed to legislate &quot; at theearliest opportunity,&quot; they thought it right that the Home secretary should himself submit the case to Cabinet. This he has done in cp. (56) 163. It is, in my view, impossible to deal with both the shops (Closing Hours) Bill and the Betting and Gaming Bill in one and the next Session. I would give priority to the Shops (closing hours) Bill.
(e) Local Government Re-organisation and Finance. The issues involvedhere are complex. The provisional conclusion of the Future legislation committee is that, while we should continue to aim at publishing a white Paper on Local Government Re-organisation in the summeror early autumn, there is no strong case for legislation until the 1957-58Session particularly since this would help to defer publication of thefirst report of the proposed new Local Government boundary commission until after the next General Election. There may be a stronger case for legislating next Session on Local Government Finance;for if the Cabinet approve the introduction of some degree of industrial,and perhaps agricultural, re-rating (on which proposals will shortly becoming forward), it may well prove desirable to give the taxpayer assoon as possible whatever relief it may be practicable to provide as aresult. Nevertheless, the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentfeels and the Future Legislation Committee do not disagree that,if the choice lies between legislation to reform Local government finance and legislation to reform the House of Lords, the latter shouldhave priority. (This is on the assumption, which will need to be checkedwith the Law Officers, that it will be possible if the legislation isdeferred to use certain powers under the Local Government Act, 1948,to deal with a particular problem in connection with the rating of the nationalised industries.)7. I must also draw the attention of my colleagues to the fact that theAgricultural Marketing and Guarantees Bill in List A (together with the Agriculture(Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the Hire Purchase Bill, and the Inventions and designs (Defence) Bill in List B, if time can be found for any of them andthe Hire Purchase Bill would be a substantial measure) will represent the onlyprovision next Session for replacing emergency powers by permanent legislation.I do not see how, in the circumstances, this can be helped; but it will not be welcome to our supporters, and we must try to remedy the deficiency in the1957-58 Session.8. Finally, I must emphasise that it is only with the greatest difficulty thatthe programme has been compressed within the limits indicated in thismemorandum; and it is still too long. It will impose a very heavy burden on ministers; and it will provide no relief for our own supporters, who are findingeven the present Session too exacting, owing to the large number of Committeedays. There is still too much legislation; and we must all try, by every possiblelegitimate means, to reduce it.R. A. B.Office of the Lord Privy Seal, S.W.1,2nd July, 1956.
