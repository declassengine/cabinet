OPEN-CAST MININGMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 31st January, 1956, the Cabinet appointed a Committee of ministers under my Chairmanship to formulate and apply a revised policy for open-castmining and to report from time to time (C.M. (56) 8th Conclusions, Minute 9).2.     We have received reports from officials on:-(i) the production programme for the next ten years;(ii)  procedures and compensation provisions.Production programme.     The officials&apos; report set out the opposed views of the Minister ofAgriculture and the Secretary of State for Scotland, on the one hand;  and ofthe Minister of Fuel and Power, on the other, with regard to the use ofagricultural land for open-cast coal production.    There are three possible courses:-(a) The suggestion of the Minister of Agriculture, viz., that the sitesnow &quot;frozen&quot; for agricultural reasons should remain frozen; but that alimited number of other first-class agricultural sites should be selected for exemption until the end of 1958 on a basis that had regard to coal supply aswell as agricultural considerations.    The Secretary of State for Scotlandwants to continue the ban on open-cast coal working and prospecting on first-class and near-first class land in East Lothian, together with ageneral ban on working on all other land which the Department ofAgriculture for Scotland consider to be first class.    Adoption of these policies would give a total output for 1957 and 1958 of about 23j million tons.(b) The Minister of Fuel and Power considers that in the present coal situation, having regard to our balance of payments, open-cast production should not be limited to twelve million tons a year.    He would, therefore,wish to bring the sites frozen for agricultural reasons into the production programme after the end of this year, since the next two years will becrucial.    If his proposal is adopted, it would give an output of 25. 6 million tons in 1957 and 1958 and an average of 12.6 million tons a year over thewhole period 1957 to 1965.(c) The Official Committee have put forward a middle course.    Thisis that in future there should be no general ban on open-cast working withoutprejudice to individual cases, where very strong agricultural or amenityobjections may exist; and that sites now frozen should remain frozen, exceptSECRETC.P. (56) 194 COPY NO. J_&apos;28th July, 1956CABINET
for three in East Lothian which are not of the same very high agriculturalquality as the other exempted sites and which are assumed to contain about one million tons of coal.    The frozen sites would be reconsidered in theevent of output being lost if it was decided to change over from defence regulations to semi-permanent legislation.    This compromise course is acceptable to the Minister of Agriculture, but the Secretary of State forScotland reserves his position as regards East Lothian.    The Minister of fuel and Power, however, for the reasons given above, wishes to modify the compromise proposal to obtain greater production in the two ensuingyears.4.     Increased production in 1957 and 1958 can, however, only be obtained by releasing sites which have so far been exempt on various grounds.    Wehave reviewed these and their continued exemption is being examined againby the Ministers concerned.    We have agreed, however, that, with regardto sites frozen on amenity grounds, undertakings already given precludeany working at Wentworth Woodhouse in Yorkshire and at Delhi Extensionin Northumberland, but that the adjacent site at Blyth River inNorthumberland may be brought into production at the end of 1957 when thepresent undertaking expires.    Further consideration on their merits isalso being given to eight separate sites in Yorkshire - mainly woodland -which have been preserved on amenity grounds and whose working would arouse considerable opposition from the local authorities.    The extra coal which could be obtained if the sites mentioned were permitted to be workedis calculated to be as follows:-5.     Fresh examination is also being given to the exempted agriculturalsites with a view to making available for working any which do not clearlyfall within the category of first-class land, but we are not yet able to give an estimate of the possible additional yield.    Subject to these reviews werecommend that the modified compromise course be adopted, the Secretaryof State for Scotland reserving his position on the three sites in East6.     Ever since open-cast operations began, the need for coal has been so urgent that work has followed hard on prospecting and much of thishas been on good agricultural land.    If more of this land is to be saved from open-cast working, it is essential to build up a reserve of sites wherecoal has been proved in order that a choice can be made where land ofdifferent agricultural qualities is involved.    The National Coal Boardcannot speed up prospecting to the extent required without a considerable increase in their technical staff; they will, in fact, need to increase their staff in order to maintain the present rate of production.    If they are to recruit and retain staff, they need to be able to offer them security ofemployment over a number of years, and this will be greatly helped by aGovernment announcement that as far as can be foreseen open-castproduction will continue at a high level for at least ten years.    We there-fore ask our colleagues to authorise the Minister of Fuel and Power tomake such a statement.Blyth River:1.2 million tons (of which only 200, 000 tons would be obtained by the end of 1958).Seven sitesin Yorkshire:435, 000 tons (the Minister of Housing andLocal Government and the Minister of fuel and Power have agreed that the eighth siteshould not be touched, and that the otherseven should be examined: possibly200, 000 tons might be obtained by this process).Lothian.
11.    We accordingly invite the Cabinet to agree -(1) that the compromise production programme outlined in pai*agraphs 3(c), 4 and 5 should be adopted, theSecretary of State for Scotland reserving his position on the proposal to bring three sites in East Lothianinto production;(2) that the Minister of Fuel and Power should announceon a suitable occasion that open-cast production isexpected to continue at a high level for at leastten years;(3)  that more generous compensation should be paidboth to landlords and tenants;7.     The report of officials was prepared on the basis that Defence Regula-lions could not last indefinitely and that, therefore, within the next fewyears, they must be succeeded by some more permanent form of legislation which would conform to normal peacetime requirements, including thelodging of appeals by affected parties and the holding of public enquiriesor hearings.8.     We recognise that if it is decided that Defence Regulations relatingto land must be abolished within the next few years, a new Bill will berequired to enable the National Coal Board to obtain land for open-castmining.    Nevertheless, we are impressed by the difficulties of legislation on this subject, apart from the difficulty of fitting such a Bill into thelegislative time-table.    In debate, the whole open-cast programme mightbe called into question, and even if there were an overlap in the cominginto operation of the new Bill before the expiry of Defence Regulations -which in itself would give rise to awkward anomalies - there would be an inevitable loss of production while the new and slower procedures took effect.   - It has been estimated that this &quot;once for all&quot; loss might be as high as 2 million tons.9.     We recommend, therefore, that the existing procedure under defence Regulations, which has worked for fourteen years, should bemaintained as long as possible.    We recognise that it is capable of improve-ment, more particularly since the Regulations were drafted in a war-timecontext.    Certain improvements, including better compensation, wererecommended by officials and will make the procedure more acceptable.The greatest need for improvement is in compensation; we recommendthat this should be much more generous, and officials are working outdetails of a modified scheme.    An improved scale of compensation might go some way towards lessening the objections by owners and occupiers torequisitioning.10.    Increased compensation to owners and occupiers does nothing tomollify other objectors, such as planning authorities, and the normalopportunities for appeals and public enquiries will still not be available.Nevertheless, we think that for the reasons already given the disadvantagesare outweighed by the merits of the present system.Summary
