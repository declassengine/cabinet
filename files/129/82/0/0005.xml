THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER. BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1956SECRETCP. (56) 155g   25th June, 1956FORCES&apos; CONDITIONS OF SERVICE IN germany memorandum by the Secretary of State for WarThe drastic reduction and eventual cessation of support costs from theGerman Federal Government which we now face make the utmost economy inour Forces&apos; expenditure in Germany imperative. Officials of the War Office andAir Ministry have studied the subject in conjunction with the Treasury; appreciableeconomies have already been agreed upon and others are in prospect.2. One field in which savings must clearly be made is that of the conditionsof service of British Servicemen in Germany. This is a particularly sensitive fieldat a time when Service conditions and recruiting and the future of National service are much in the public eye. We have already agreed to substantial economieshere but we are being pressed to go further than I consider wise and the purposeof this paper is to seek a Cabinet decision on the outstanding points at issue.3. Because the stationing of British troops in Germany started with the Forcesof Occupation and because their Deutschemark costs have hitherto been met bythe Germans, officers and other ranks have so far enjoyed the benefit of a numberof concessions not found elsewhere. Many of these must naturally now be given up and among the economies already accepted are the following:  (a) The Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes (N.A.A.F.I.) have so far receivedbenefits which were equivalent to a subsidy of about  2\ million a year.These are now being given up except for certain items worth some 300,000 which have been agreed with the Treasury. The loss toN.A.A.F.I. will have to be made up by substantial increases in prices and some deterioration in service;(b) the amount of free leave travel to the United Kingdom has been curtailed;this will produce a net saving of some  200,000 in a full year;(c) German civil labour hitherto available to units at cheap rates has been stopped.4. There are three items, however, on which agreement has not beenreached:  (a) Normally Service families overseas purchase their food from civilian shopsor N.A.A.F.I. and are given cash allowances towards the cost of doing so. Families in Germany get no such allowances because they are allowed to buy Service rations. This is a relic of the days when foodwas short in Germany and British personnel were forbidden to buy food from German sources. Now, with food so plentiful in the Germanshops, most families do in fact buy much of their food on the Germanmarket rather than from the Royal Army Service Corps and the factthat they do not get the usual cash allowance towards the cost of doing so is much resented. The Treasury agree that the present position isoutdated and that families have a right to the normal allowance but have asked for the change to be,postponed until 1st April, 1957. If thisis done, some  800,000 will be saved in the remainder of this financialyear.(b) Up to the present, married officers and other ranks have been ableto have a servant at special concessional rates, a concessions which has been worth about  1-2 million a year.

2given allowances to enable them to employ one or more servants(depending on station and climate) this is not the case when they are stationed in Europe because the climate is a temperate one. TheTreasury accordingly press for the immediate reduction of this concession to a cost of some  500,000 and its complete withdrawal by 1958.(c) Officers in static establishments in Germany at present enjoy a slightly higher scale of batmen than in the United Kingdom. This costs some 90,000 a year and is justified by the fact that officers in Germany (wear uniform constantly and are so frequently required to go out on training exercises. The Treasury press for the withdrawal of this concession.5. Whilst fully recognising the need for considerable economies, I regard it as of great importance that we should not too drastically worsen conditions ofservice in Germany. There are many reasons for this. The regular soldier nowspends two-thirds of his service overseas, much of it in very unattractive oruncomfortable stations or circumstances. Germany is the only big station wherereasonably comfortable conditions obtain and the soldier not unnaturally looksto service in Germany to compensate him in some measure for his hardshipselsewhere. We have no hope of attracting a sufficient number of regular recruitsunless we offer conditions of service which are overall not too unattractive.Germany is a very big factor in this and a serious worsening of conditions therewill make service in the Regular Army less attractive than it is now and vitiate thegood effects of the pay increase. Another factor is that following the recent pay increases the theory was widely canvassed that having given with one hand, theTreasury and Service Departments would soon start taking the money back withthe other. It would be extremely unfortunate if the wholesale withdrawal of thebest of the conditions of Service in Germany lent force to this accusation.6. The economies already agreed will worsen the position of Servicemenand their families in Germany reduced leave travel, higher N.A.A.F.I. prices andprobably a poorer N.A.A.F.I. service. This must be accepted. But I considerthat to add to this the withdrawal or too drastic reduction of the domestic serviceavailable to officers and senior other ranks would produce a deplorable effect. I accept that the present system of letting families have domestic servants atconcessional rates must stop. But I regard it as of great importance that marriedofficers and other ranks down to the rank of sergeant (this is the stage at whichmost N.C.O.S have to decide whether they will make the Army their career) shouldbe paid a local overseas allowance which will in sOme measure compensate them forthe loss of this concession and enable them, with some contribution from their pay,to continue to employ a servant whole-time or, at least, part-time. The concessionbeing withdrawn is worth about  1-2 million. In my view nothing less than theinclusion as a permanent feature of the married rate of local overseas allowance in Germany of an element in respect of domestic service, which will on present strength cost  750,000 (proportionately less if the strength is reduced), will prevent this deterioration in conditions having a most adverse effect on the outcome of our efforts to recruit more regulars.7.   / accordingly recommend as follows:  (a) the married rate of local overseas allowance for officers and other ranksdown to and including sergeant in Germany should include an elementfor domestic service which will cost some  750,000 at present strength(and proportionately less if that strength is reduced);(b) the special scale of batmen for static establishments (paragraph 4(c)above) should cease;.   (c) the normal family ration system should not be introduced until 1st April, 1957.8.   My recommendations at 7 (b) and 7 (c) are conditional on the acceptanceof 7 (a). If 7 (a) is rejected, I must reconsider the other two matters.9. I have made the above case on the basis of the needs and conditions ofthe Army. The Royal Air Force is similarly concerned, however, and theSecretary of State for Air fully agrees with my views and proposals. The figuresof cost quoted in this paper therefore includes the Royal Air Force.A. H.The War Office, S.W.1,23rd June, 1956.
