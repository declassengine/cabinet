secret,P.(56) 199 COPY NO. c^K*31st July, 1956CABINETNORTHERN IRELAND: SPECIAL AGRICULTURAL grant for 1956-57Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department and Minister for Welsh affairs in November, 1953, the agricultural guarantee arrangements werechanged to new arrangements based on a free market, in accordance withthe policy outlined in the White Paper on Decontrol of Food and marketing of Agricultural Produce (Cmd. 8989).    It was then expected that producers in remote areas would receive lower returns than producers near to the markets, because of greater transport costs.    There was particularanxiety amongst producers in Northern Ireland because so much of theirproduce has to be shipped across the Irish Sea and their transport costs are especially heavy.    In recognition of the problem that would arise inNorthern Ireland my predecessor made a statement in the House on10th February, 1954, in which he said:-&quot;The Government do not expect Northern Ireland producersto carry the whole burden of a greater degree of price differentia-tion than that borne by other distant producers on the mainland.They have therefore decided that a financial adjustment should bemade betv/een the two Governments, a grant, the amount of whichwill be determined annually, being placed at the disposal of theGovernment of Northern Ireland to use for the purpose of assist-ing the agricultural industry. &quot;2.     Subsequently, grants were determined for 1954-55 ( 1,030,000)and 1955-56 ( 1, 245, 000),    It is now necessary to determine the grant for 1956-57.    An official working group have sifted the relevant dataabout the prices realised in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain duringthe year 1955-56, on which the calculation of the grant for the current year must be based.    The only commodities on which there is a differential to be considered in connection with the grant are fat cattle,fat pigs and potatoes.    A note about the calculation for each commodityis annexed to this memorandum.    There was disagreement between officials of the different Departments concerned about the amount of theaward which should be given to Northern Ireland in the light of the agreed amount of the differentials.    The following summarises thedifferent viewpoints:-(i)  The Ministry of Agriculture for Northern Ireland,supported by the Home Office, recommended an award of  1,491,000.(ii)   The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foodrecommended the award of  1, 133, 000.
(iii)    The Treasury and the Department of agriculture for Scotland recommended  624,000.The United Kingdom Government Ministers concerned agreed on a settle-ment at  864, 000 based on an award of 9s. a cwt. for fat cattle, with noaward for potatoes or pigs.    The Financial Secretary was not convincedthat on merits any increase over  624, 000 was justified, and agreed to 864, 000 only as a final settlement.3.     This decision was communicated to the Northern Ireland Govern-ment, with the result that the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland,Lord Brookeborough, accompanied by the Minister of Finance and theMinister of Agriculture for Northern Ireland, came to London on23rd July to represent to the United Kingdom Ministers the grave view which the Government of Northern Ireland took of the smallness of theaward.    They foresaw acute difficulties arising in the Northern ireland parliament and thought that the view would be taken throughout NorthernIreland that the United Kingdom Government regret their original decisionto assist Northern Ireland and were gradually &quot;whittling away&quot; the amountof the grant.    They argued that it would be reasonable for the award to bebased upon the same proportion of the ascertained differential as in theprevious two years.    United Kingdom Ministers concerned have held theview that each commodity should be examined on its merits and that aglobal calculation should not be made.4,     The main point of difference between the Northern Ireland Govern-ment and ourselves is on potatoes.    Because of the shortage last yearhigh prices were received by producers throughout the United Kingdom,which were substantially above the guaranteed support price levels.    Onthe other hand yields per acre were comparatively low, but on balancemy colleagues and I took the view that no award was due for potatoesbecause of the high prices received.    The Northern Ireland Governmenton the other hand think that an award should be made because even higher prices were received in other remote areas of the United Kingdom -in particular the north of Scotland:  and in the submission of the NorthernIreland Government it is the difference between these prices and NorthernIreland prices which matters and not simply whether the Northern Irelandproducers have already done very well.5.      The Financial Secretary is of the opinion that  864, 000 is the absolute maximum that should be awarded.    He cannot see any reason why the British taxpayer should be required to provide a further  269,000to improve the already satisfactory price received by the Northern Irelandpotato growers and he does not consider that any of the argumentsproduced by Northern Ireland Ministers justify any alteration in thefigure previously agreed.    But in view of the strong representations made by Lord Brookeborough and his colleagues about the political difficulties which would face them in Northern Ireland if we persist withan award of  064, 000, I am convinced that it is expedient to award alarger sum.    The United Kingdom Government Ministers (with theexception of the Treasury Ministers) propose that the figure originallyput forward by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, namely 1,133, 000, should be substituted.6.     The Northern Ireland Ministers told us that they v/ere certain tobe under heavy pressure about the amount of the award this year andthere would be demands for them to reveal how the calculations weremade.    If the United Kingdom Government insist on an award of
 864, 000, the Northern Ireland Ministers would be bound to inform theNorthern Ireland Parliament that the amount of the award had been impose upon them in the face of their strong representations, and they might find it necessary to explain how the calculation had been arrived at.    It seemsto me highly undesirable that details of the calculation should be revealed,as the arguments which have to be taken into account in preparing thefigures are extremely complicated and the figures are at times somewhatarbitrary, although I have no doubt they are substantially correct.    the calculation of the award is a matter for the United Kingdom Governmentand it appears to be inappropriate for details to be revealed by NorthernIreland Ministers.    I would suggest, therefore, that, if the higher awardwhich I have mentioned is decided upon, we should, in communicating itto the Northern Ireland Government, make it on the conditions that they shall not reveal any details of the calculation, and that they shall not represent it as an imposed settlement.7.     I ask my colleagues to decide on the amount of the award to bemade to Northern Ireland for the current year and recommend that theyadopt the figure of  1,133, 000.g.

ANNEXNORTHERN IRELANDDETAILS OF THE CALCULATION OF THESPECIAL GRANT FOR 1956-57Fat cattleThe differential with England on which the previous grants were based was 9s. a cwt.; of this it was decided to award 5s. a cwt., giving 630, 000 for 1954-55 and  725, 000 for 1955-56.?...     This differential in 1955-56 widened to 16s. a cwt.    This is by-comparison of die producers in Northern Ireland with the average producerin England;  to reach a comparison with the remote producers on the main-land it would be right to make some discount from the figure of 16s. a cwt.It is impossible to say what the amount of this discount should be, but itmight be put at about 5s. to 6s. a cwt.    To award as much as 10s. a cwt.would, however, bring the returns to producers in Northern Ireland above those of a significant number of producers on the mainland.    Vfhilst theMinistry of Agriculture for Northern Ireland claimed 10s. 8d. a cwt.(a total of  1,024,000) officials of the Ministry of Agriculture, fisheries and Food recommended an award of 9s. a cwt. which would represent thesame proportion of the price differential with England as ministers decided to award last year.    (9s. a cwt. would give a total grant of 864, 000.)   Officials of the Treasury and the Department of agriculture for Scotland regard 10s. a cwt. (the standard price) as the maximum claim of the Northern Ireland producer and considered that not more than6s. 6d. of this should be awarded (giving a total of  624,000).3.      The United Kingdom Ministers concerned decided to award9s. a cwt., giving a total award to Northern Ireland for fat cattle of 864, 000.Fat pigs4.     The figures for 1955-56 show that producers in Northern Irelandreceived prices at least 3d. per score higher - not lower - than thosereceived by producers in the area taken for comparison, namely, NorthScotland, and officials agreed that no claim arises in the current year inrespect of fat pigs.    The Treasury and the Department of Agriculture forScotland have maintained that, since Northern Ireland producers receivedmore from pigs than Scottish producers, their advantage on thiscommodity should be offset against their disadvantage on other commodities.    Officials of the Home Office and the Ministry of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food opposed this suggestion, since it cannot be maintained that the higher prices in Northern Ireland are due to the remoteness of producers from their market;  rather they are &quot;in spite of&quot; that distance,and the advantage in the prices received by Northern Ireland producersmust be the result of other factors, such as better quality and bettermarketing arrangements.5.     The United Kingdom Ministers agreed to leave fat pigs out of account in determining the grant to be paid.
6.     The present support price arrangements for potatoes operated forthe first time in the case of the 1940 crop and, when the special grant for last year was determined, there were no data on which any claim inrespect of potatoes for that year could.be assessed; consequently, anyaward for this commodity must be considered for the two years 1955-56and 1956-57.7.    The figures used by officials show that potato producers in NorthernIreland last year received about 36s. a ton less than producers in north Scotland.    There is an accepted difference in the regional supportprice for Northern Ireland as compared with North Scotland of 10s. perton, and the amount of the differential between North Scotland andNorthern Ireland to be used for the calculation of the grant is therefore26s. per ton, which gives a figure of  273,000 for 1955-56 and  422,000for 1956-57 - a total of  700,000.    Officials of the Northern IrelandMinistry of Agriculture, supported by the Home Office, recommended an award of two-thirds of this sum - a figure of  467, 000.     The treasury and the Department of Agriculture for Scotland thought that, in view ofthe high prices realised everywhere for potatoes, producers in NorthernIreland could not be regarded as having suffered any undue burden byreason of their remoteness, and thought that no award on potatoes shouldbe made.    Officials of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foodthought that some allowance should be made for the fact that the high prices received last year were to some extent offset by the exceptionallylow yield of the crop which was only some 6. 5 tons per acre comparedwith a normal yield of 7.6 tons.    Allowing for this factor, officials of theMinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food considered that a fairaward on potatoes would be 10s. a ton - a total of  269, 000.8.      The United Kingdom Ministers decided not to make any award forpotatoes, but a majority now propose that the Ministry of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food figure of  269, 000 should be accepted.summary. The recommendations of the different Departments may, therefore,be summarised as follows:-(1)The Ministry of Agriculture for Northern Ireland,supported by the Home Office:-Fat cattle - 10 s. 3d. per cwt. -  1, 024,000Potatoes - 17s. 4d. per ton -  467,000Total -   1, 491, 000(2)The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food:-Fat cattle  -  9s. per cwt.Potatoes    - 10a. per tonTotal 864,000 269,000-    1, 133,000The Treasury and the Department of agriculture for Scotland:-Fat cattle - 6s. 6d. per cwt. -  624,000Potatoes    -  Nil.Total  624,000
