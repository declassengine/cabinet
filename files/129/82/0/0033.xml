THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1956CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.  2!CP. (56) 18319th July, 1956CABINETECONOMIC STATISTICSNote by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and President of theBoard of TradeIn the Budget Speech, an assurance was given that the Government would deal with the problem of improving our economic statistics. There is no doubt thatwe still do not have enough up-to-date knowledge of changes in the economicsituation. We are now clear what steps are needed to improve the position andwe feel that a statement of what we propose to do ought to be made before theHouse rises. We attach a draft of the statement we have in mind and seek theagreement of our colleagues to it.2. One of these proposals is that we should get more reliable and compre-hensive information from the distributive and service trades, notably about their capital expenditure and stocks.3. Both as a basis for getting up-to-date figures and as an annual check on them, an annual sample enquiry is necessary and this can only be taken if returns are obtained under the compulsory powers already given by the Statistics of TradeAct, 1947.4. Because this is more far-reaching than the other proposals we feel that our colleagues should know about it before any statement is made in the House..5. We do not expect any serious difficulty in making this enquiry whichwill, of course, be directed to the relatively small businesses to be found outsidethe manufacturing field. The information to be sought will be simple in character and fairly easy for them to supply on an annual basis. Powers conferred by the statistics of Trade Act, 1947, are already being used in a number of enquiriesdirected to small businesses. We believe that it will be possible to convince thetrades concerned of the need for the information, and of the advantages that will come from the use of sampling procedures, even though this involves the use of statutory powers.H.

DRAFT STATEMENT ON ECONOMIC STATISTICS BY THECHANCELLOR OF THE exchequer in my Budget Speech I said that I was considering ways of improving our economic statistics and that I hoped to make progress as soon as more immediatepreoccupations were out of the way. A thorough review of the statistics available and of the additions needed has now been made.2. During the last two years important improvements have been made inour economic statistics, with the full co-operation of industry. But the information available still does not provide us with enough up-to-date knowledge of changesin the economic situation. It is certainly in the interests of everyone that this information should be available. The earlier the Government has it the moretimely can be its action to keep the economy on an even course. In economics,as in medicine, early diagnosis is the essential preliminary to effective treatment.The Government does not need this information only for its own use. The business community and the public need it just as much.3. I can now indicate the general lines of a programme to meet theseneeds:-1. Our first need is to be up-to-date. We are, of course, largely in thehands of the people who supply the information. I cannot stress too muchhow important it is that firms should provide the statistics we need just assoon as they can.2. Secondly, some material which informs us about the state of industryis received at intervals which are too long in relation to the speed with whichevents can move. Figures about the production of goods or about the ordersreceived are much more valuable when they are available month by monththan when the intervals between one return and another is three or six months,as is sometimes the case. From some important industries which are not now providing them we shall be asking for monthly statistics about their production and orders. And in a variety of industries we shall be seekingmore frequent returns or new returns where none are now made.3. Thirdly, there are serious gaps in our information about fixed investment and stocks. Yet fixed investment and stocks are two of the mostvolatile elements in the economy. They are liable to fluctuate widely, causingsubstantial changes in the economic climate and in the balance of payments.It is therefore particularly important that we should have comprehensiveinformation about them. The information which we are now getting fromthe annual census of production and from the quarterly returns provided by companies and the nationalised industries is of great value. But this coversonly part of the field. We have very little information, even annually, fromthe distributive and service trades. These trades are of special importancebecause they carry very large stocks. We propose, therefore, to institute anannual sample enquiry which to yield reliable information must be of a compulsory character so that the value of the figures willingly supplied bythe majority of traders will not be nullified by a minority of non-respondingbusinesses. The figures we need are few in number but vital to us and Ibelieve that businessmen in the distributive and service trades will be ableto provide them without undue trouble.4. Fourthly, one of the matters on which up-to-date information islacking is the current trend of profits. A few companies are now publishingquarterly or half-yearly estimates of their trading profits. Whether companies should publish such information is, of course, a matter for themselves. but since many companies keep quarterly or half-yearly estimates of profits fortheir own purposes, we propose to invite a number of companies, on a voluntary basis, to provide such estimates, in confidence, to the InlandRevenue Department. Of course, only summaries of the returns, which willnot reveal the affairs of any individual concern, will be published, or indeedmade available to anyone outside the Department.5. Fifth, we have felt an urgent need for more information aboutinternational transactions, especially those on capital account, affecting thebalance of payments. We are studying, in co-operation with the Bank ofEngland, how improvements in this field can best be made.
6. Sixth, fulki information is needed aboui trends in the pattern of personal incomes and expenditure. An excellent foundation exists in thelarge-scale enquiry conducted by the Ministry of Labour for 1953-54, forwhich 13,000 households provided detailed accounts. It is now proposedto have a continuing enquiry among a smaller sample of households in orderto provide up-to-date information about changes in income and expenditure.4. We are very much aware that all this information depends on the willingco-operation of the public. I am sure this will be forthcoming. For it really is inthe public interest.5. We are considering what improvements and extensions can be made inthe presentation and publication of statistics so that Parliament, industry and thepublic may be kept as well informed as possible. One important objective is to combine the available information into quarterly estimates of the national expenditure and its components, similar to the annual figures given in the national income Blue Book and Economic Surveys.6. I would add that, while these are our immediate objectives, theimprovement of our statistical information is a continuing process.
