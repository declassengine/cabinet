secret.P. (56) 186 COPY NO.19th July, 195611CABINETTHE LAW OF MURDERMemorandum by the Lord chancellor the Cabinet, on 11th July, 1956, appointed a Committee   -&quot;To consider and report to the Cabinet on thepossibility of framing a Government measure toamend the law of murder and to restrict therebythe scope of capital punishment, &quot;   (C.M.(56) 48thConclusions, Minute 5.)The Committee was composed of the Lord Chancellor (Chairman), HomeSecretary, Secretary of State for Scotland, Attorney-General and lord advocate.    The Chief Whip and the Solicitor-General were co-opted to theCommittee.Except for further consideration of points of detail, theCommittee have completed their review and their conclusions are set out below.2. The Committee are satisfied that it would be practicable to frame legislation amending the law of murder so as to reduce the crime in four ways:-(a) By extending the defence of provocation so that thenature of the provocation will be immaterial, andit will be open to a jury to return a verdict ofmanslaughter notwithstanding that the provocationwas by words alone.(b) By eliminating from English law the doctrine of constructive malice.(c) By introducing into English law the Scottish doctrine of diminished responsibility, the effect of whichwill be that where the jury are satisfied that the prisoners responsibility was substantiallydiminished by reason of mental abnormality theywill bring in a verdict of manslaughter./^&quot;it is proposed that in order to establish a defence ofdiminished responsibility the defence should be requiredto satisfy the jury of something on the following lines:-
that at the time of the commission of the actwhich caused the death the accused -(a) was suffering from a disease ordisorder of the mind, or(b) was a defective within the meaning of the Mental Deficiency Act, 1913,and in consequence thereof was labouring undera defence of reason or disorder of emotion tosuch an extent that his responsibility was substantially diminished^(d) By providing that the survivor of a suicide pact whohas not himself killed the other party shall be guilty of a new offence of aiding and abetting orinstigating suicide and not of murder.3.       As at present advised the Scottish Ministers do not think itnecessary that legislation dealing with the four points mentioned in thepreceding paragraph should be applied to Scotland.4.       The Committee do not believe that a limited reform of the lawin relation to these points alone would command a sufficient measure of support among Conservative Members of Parliament known to favour thetotal abolition of the death penalty.    They therefore recommend that capital punishment should in future be reserved for a limited number of specified categories of murder somewhat on the following lines:-(a) Murder in the course of, or immediately before or after and in connection with,theft or attempted theft, or entry orattempted entry into a building with intent to steal.(b) Murder by the use of fire arms orexplosives.(c) Murder of prison officers.(d) Murder of police officers and othersassisting the police in the execution oftheir duty.(e) Murder following a previous murder.UIn view of the difficulty of dealing with cases of hmultiple murders&apos;, such asthose committed by Christie and Heath,it may be necessary to evolve a procedure by which two such murders may be triedin the same indictment^y7Murders falling outside these specified categories would in future bepunishable by life imprisonment.
5.        The Committee were unable to agree whether murder by poisoningshould be added to these categories.    Murders of this kind may be heartlessand cruel;  on the other hand a large number of them are either &quot;mercykilling&quot; or murder by a distraught woman of her children and in thesecases there is invariably a reprieve.    The Cabinet are invited to decide whether, on balance, murders of this kind should continue to be punishableby death.6.        A table is attached showing roughly what would have been theeffect on the number of executions during the last ten years of legislation to restrict the use of the death penalty to the categories of murders setout in paragraph 4 above.    This table does not take account of the fourchanges in the law of murder proposed in paragraph 2: the effect of these would be to reduce the number of convictions of murder, and hence toreduce still further the number of executions.7.        The Committee emphasise that it will be desirable to consult theLord Chief Justice and other representatives of the Judiciary before adecision is taken on the final form of the amendments to the law of murder or of the definitions of categories of murder for which the death penalty should be retained.    If, therefore, the Cabinet approve theproposals contained in this memorandum as a basis for informal soundingsby the Chief Whip among Government supporters, it is essential that nothing should be said which would commit the Government to anyparticular form of words.K.Lord Chancellor^ Office, S.W.1.19th July, 1956.
