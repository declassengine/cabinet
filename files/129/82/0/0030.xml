Printed for the Cabinet,   July 1956SECRET n- Copy No.CP. (56) 18025th July, 1956CABINETSOMALILAND PROTECTORATE AND THE HORN OF africa memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies on 29th March the Cabinet considered the difficulties created for us by the resumption of Ethiopian administration over the Haud and Reserved Area called &quot; the Territories.&quot; A map of the area it attached (Appendix D). Theyauthorised the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(Mr. Dodds-Parker), leader of the United Kingdom delegation to Ethiopia in April,to explore the possibility of a cession of the territories by Ethiopia to the protectorate and they agreed that the policy statement for the Protectorate shouldbe made (Appendix B) (CM. (56) 26th Conclusions, Minute 1).2. Mr. Dodds-Parker tried to persuade the Ethiopian Government to cedethe Territories but was met with so vehement a refusal that one must conclude that no attempt on our part to obtain the Territories by lease, barter or purchaseat any price which would be considered possible is ever likely to succeed. TheUnited Kingdom delegation then discussed with the Ethiopian Government thepractical methods of an harmonious working of the 1954 Agreement and receivedsome assurances that appeared to be satisfactory.3. Recent events in the Territories and in particular the interference by the ethiopians with the internal tribal organisation of British Somali tribes(Appendix C) indicate that the Ethiopian Government have no real intention of keeping the 1954 Agreement. A strong protest has been delivered regarding the incident but the Ethiopian Government are already contesting the facts. It seems clear that the deliberate policy of the Ethiopians is to try to absorb the Somalitribes in the Territories with a view to the later incorporation of the wholeProtectorate and ultimately of all Somalis in the Horn of Africa within the boundaries of the Ethiopian Empire.4. When, last May, Lord Lloyd made the policy statement authorised bythe Cabinet, there was bitter disappointment amongst Somali leaders at the lackof any reference to the Territories. In his Report (Appendix A) Lord Lloyd has confirmed that the Somalis in the Protectorate will not rest until they haverecovered the Territories which they, regardless of the 1897 Treaty, regard asrightly theirs. Indeed the National United Front has once more asked her majesty&apos;s Government to facilitate their approach to the International Court ofJustice for an advisory opinion on their petition to the United Nations which theyfirst made in 1955. No reply to this request has yet been given, but the replycannot be favourable for the same reasons which led us to reject their appeal for support for their petition in 1955.5. In the meantime as a result of recent Ethiopian behaviour in the territories the Somalis are becoming increasingly bitter and less confident of the ability of her majesty&apos;s Government to assist them. If no new initiative is taken there is likelyto be serious trouble in the Protectorate itself and we cannot rule out the possibility that senior officers of the Government might ask to be relieved of their posts in a situation which they might regard as hopeless. It has become urgently necessaryto reconsider our future policy in the Protectorate and in the Horn of Africagenerally.  The courses of action open to us would appear to be as follows.50197 b
6. We could allow an approach by the Somalis to the International Court.This would call in question our domestic jurisdiction in respect of all ourProtectorate Treaties and might even concede to the United Nations the right of interference in a wide range of Colonial issues. The result of such an approachcould only be embarrassing to Her Majesty&apos;s Government and would not in facthelp the Somalis.7. We could repudiate the 1954 Agreement. This would leave the Somaliswith only their rights under the 1897 Treaty which are very vague and less satisfactory than those under the 1954 Agreement.8. We could repudiate the 1897 Treaty. For this to be effective we shouldhave to occupy the Territories which would be an act of war against Ethiopia.This course can scarcely be considered except as a last resort after all other measures have been tried.9. We could withdraw from the Somaliland Protectorate. This wouldinvolve abandoning our responsibilities towards the Somalis and, apart from what might be considered over-riding moral considerations, is open to the following further serious objections:  (a) we should lose the confidence of all those who look to us for protectionthroughout the Commonwealth;(b) even if we were to continue to subsidise the new State there would not bethe indigenous technical, or administrative, talent, or material to enable it to stand on its own feet. We should, therefore, both politically and economically, create a vacuum which the Russians and the egyptians would be quick to exploit;(c) there are strategic arguments against withdrawal, particularly in relation toAden;(d) an independent Somaliland Protectorate whether or not associated withSomalia would inherit our obligations under the 1897 Treaty. Wecould not therefore support the new State in any attempt forciblyor through an international tribunal to repudiate that Treaty. Anyguarantee of the frontiers of the new State (which would be expected by the Somalis) would only extend to the present frontiers of the protectorate and would not include the Territories.10. We might encourage an Ethiopian/Somali rapprochement. Ethiopia isin the strong position of being in possession of the Territories. Any rapprochementtherefore would inevitably, be upon Ethiopian terms. Some qualified observersregard some form of federation between the Somalis and the Ethiopians, whereby the Somalis would regain the Territories, as the only logical solution. The factmust nevertheless be faced that the Ethiopians are hated and distrusted by the somalis, and that the Somali leaders are publicly committed to precisely the opposite policy. There is therefore no chance at the present moment that theycould be persuaded to adopt this line and any attempt on our part to encourage them to do so would merely bring additional odium upon our heads.11. We could arraign Ethiopia before the United Nations for breach of the1954 Agreement. We have clear evidence of such a breach. Under the 1954Agreement the position of the Protectorate tribes in the Territories is morefavourable than their position simply under the 1897 Treaty. In particular theAgreement allows the Protectorate tribes to have their own tribal organisation,supervised by liaison staff of the Protectorate Government. For various reasons,however, it has been found almost impossible to compel the Ethiopians in practice to observe the terms of the Agreement, and although we now have clear evidencethat the Ethiopians have broken the Agreement, this difficulty still remains.Even if we were to take the case to the United Nations the most we could hope to achieve would be an admonition to the Ethiopians to observe the Agreementfollowed by an assurance as valueless as that given to Mr. Dodds-Parker in addis ababa.  The difficulty of enforcement would still remain.Admittedly there is a certain publicity value in such a course, but on the otherhand there is still a considerable danger since the United Nations may be swayedless by concern for Somali welfare than by a wish to score off a &quot; Colonial Power &quot; that the debate might become enlarged into an examination of the 1897 treaty or that it would take some other undesirable turn embarrassing to Great Britainand perhaps other Colonial Powers, such as the French or Belgians.
Finally even if successful it would fail completely to satisfy the Somalis whohave, with justice, no confidence in Ethiopian promises and whose object in anycase is to recover the Territories.12. We might try yet again to persuade the Ethiopians to cede the territories. For many years before 1954 attempts were made to persuade the ethiopians to cede the Territories, e.g., by an exchange of the Zeia Corridor, but all failed. In view of the present expansionist policy of the Ethiopians in SomaliI areas, in addition to the traditional reluctance of the Emperor of Ethiopia to letgo any part of his Imperial heritage, it seems quite clear that the Ethiopians willnot give up the Territories unless the strongest possible pressure is brought tobear upon them. The Governor of Kenya has recently suggested that an area,the Mandera Quadrilateral, in the Northern Province of Kenya might be offered to the Ethiopians in return for the Territories. This suggestion is being studiedand it is too early to say whether it is possible to offer the Ethiopians this area.Even if it should prove possible, and even if we managed to persuade the Frenchand Americans to bring pressure upon the Ethiopians to cede the Territories in exhange for it and a sum of money, which would undoubtedly have to be verylarge, it is doubtful whether the Ethiopians would agree to dp so. To reopen thepossibility of cession at this stage is likely simply to result in delay, delay whichwill be dangerous at a time when the situation is so rapidly deteriorating.The Kenya Governments offer will of course be borne in mind as a possiblemake-weight in some other solution to the problem.In considering any solution involving cession of the Territories, careful thoughtwill have to be given to Ethiopian suspicions that these areas are coveted becausethey are believed to contain oil. Ethiopia^ interests in any such oil might haveto be safeguarded to her satisfaction, which would require very skilful negotiationsso as not to offend the Somalis unnecessarily.13. Finally, we can try to create a Greater Somalia which would include the territories. Logically and objectively the best policy for the Horn of Africa wouldbe the creation of a Greater Somalia, which would include from the outset theItalian Trust Territory (due to become independent in 1960), the SomalilandProtectorate and the Ogaden. (There are also parts of Northern Kenya which areinhabited by a predominantly Somali population, but the inclusion of these, aswell as Djibuti, in Greater Somalia need not be considered immediately.) Thecreation of a new Muslim State in the Horn of Africa is admittedly not withoutdangers from our own point of view, but the risk of the area falling under Egyptianand Russian influence through such a scheme seems less than the extreme likelihood of the same thing happening under any alternative course. Moreover an earlyinitiative in this direction by Her Majesty&apos;s Government would succeed, as nothing else would, in convincing the Somalis of the Protectorate, at the present crucialtime, that we really had their interests at heart.The revival of the Greater Somalia idea, which came to nothing when advanced by Mr. Bevin in 1946, none the less confronts us with formidable difficulties. First,we shall have to face the obvious prospect of Ethiopian opposition. Secondly, thescheme is likely to antagonise the French, who will probably regard it as a threat to Djibuti and who in any case have a profound suspicion of British policy in theHorn of Africa. Thirdly, even the Italians, though they may be easier to persuadethan the French, may suspect that we intend to bring the new State within theCommonwealth.I do not regard these difficulties as fatal, but they undoubtedly make itnecessary for us to prepare the ground with extreme care. The first essential wouldbe to persuade the French and the Italians (particularly the former) that the presentsituation is as inimical to their interests as to our own and that our aim in theHorn of Africa is to maintain not British influence as such but joint Westerninfluence. Once we can convey to our Western allies that our aim is to pursue a combined policy with them (as indeed it must be if there is to be any hope of success)and not to increase our influence at their expense, I feel that the dangers ofresurrecting the Greater Somalia idea will be much reduced. We may then,moreover, be able to bring the French in particular to understand, as they do not seem to do at present, the full dangers of the present position. They tend to regardus as having wilfully created Somali nationalism. Nothing could be further fromthe truth. Somali nationalism has created itself, and the problem will in any casecome to a head in 1960. All that we are trying to do is to contend with the fact as we find them, and to keep the situation under control.   The present Ethiopian50197
attitude in the Territories which the French seem almost inclined to encourage, isthe one thing which above all else will drive the Somalis into the hands of the egyptians and make them bitterly and permanently hostile to the West.If this line of thought is accepted by my colleagues, a positive course of actionbegins to emerge. The stages would be as follows. First, we should enter intoclose and confidential consultations with the French and the Italians on the linesof the preceding sub-paragraph. I would like once again to stress the importanceof this stage, since I regard the achievement of a mutual understanding with ourWestern allies as one of the most vital factors in this whole problem. At the sametime it would be equally important, perhaps even more important, to explain ourideas and plans to the Americans, if only because of their decisive influence inEthiopian foreign policy. If we were able to secure American, French and Italiansupport, a joint approach would be made to the Ethiopians. It would be brought home to them with renewed force that their present policies towards the Somalisare likely to have a disastrous effect on themselves by exposing their eastern flankto Egyptian and probably Russian influence. Some more positive bait than thiswould, however, be needed; and I suggest that the Ethiopians should be told that greater Somalia, once created, could federate with Ethiopia if, of its own free will,it decided to do so. This prospect would provide the Ethiopians with some incentive to behave decently towards the Somalis in the future.The above suggestion admittedly leaves some points unanswered. First, howwould the Greater Somalia scheme be launched? The details of this could be worked out with our allies, but it may be necessary to propose at an early stage the convening of an international conference. Secondly, what would be the status of Greater Somalia after it had come into being? Here again, discussion with our allies would be required. The objective would presumably be that Greater Somaliashould from the outset form an independent State but it would almost certainly have to be supported by financial and other assistance from the Western powers concerned. This would in fact amount to an unofficial &quot; consortium,&quot; with whichEthiopia might be offered the prospect of participation, dependent upon good behaviour towards the Somalis from now on. (This condition would not be anidle threat, since in the present state of Somali feeling any association of Ethiopiawith the control of Somali affairs, however unofficial, would be out of the question.)It might be necessary, however, to envisage some more formal type of consortium,under the aegis of the United Nations. This would present dangers and difficulties,and if we were to embark on any such course it would be doubly essential that the americans, the French, and the Italians and ourselves should first be in full agreement on the whole policy. Otherwise there would be no guarantee whateverthat a United Nations sponsored consortium would not simply let in the russians and the Egyptians through the back door.14. Conclusions. Despite the difficulties it involves, I believe after serious consideration that renewed sponsorship of a Greater Somalia project is the best course for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to take in the present situation in whichall the possible courses of action appear to involve great risks. I therefore invitemy colleagues to agree that we should initiate confidential discussions with theFrench, American and Italian Governments on the lines outlined in the preceding paragraph. I must stress that in view of the present deteriorating circumstancesspeed is of vital importance. In the meantime there is no alternative but for the protectorate Government, aided by the firm action now being taken by our ambassador at Addis Ababa, to persist in trying to make the 1954 Agreement work.A.

APPENDIX AREPORT BY LORD LLOYD ON HIS VISIT TO SOMALILAND20th-31st May, 1956GeneralI spent ten days in the Protectorate during which time I was able to see a fairamount of the country and to meet a large number of Somalis from different sections of the community. Details of my programme are in the Appendix (notprinted) to this Report. At the end of my visit I made a statement on the radioregarding Her Majesty&apos;s Governments future policy for the Protectorate.2. There were inevitably a large number of detailed matters which I discussed with the Governor and his officials and on which I was able to form a view. Thesematters will be pursued in the Department but for the sake of brevity are not covered by this report, the object of which is to endeavour to give a general picture of the political situation and prospects in the Protectorate as they appeared to me.Political situation. Two factors appear to dominate political thought in the Protectorate.First and most fundamental, the bitterness which is felt generally over the loss ofthe Haud and the Reserved Area and, secondly, political development in Somalia.4. It will be a great mistake I think to under-estimate the feeling that existsregarding the Haud and the Reserved Area. Everywhere I went it was the first and in some cases the only topic that was raised, and in the minds of the majorityof people at the present time it occupies a much more prominent place than evenpolitical and economic advance. The reasons are not far to see. One has only to travel through the barren and water-less land of the Protectorate and subsequently to visit the country adjacent to the Haud and Reserved Area to realise the infinitelysuperior grazing value of these latter Areas and it is clear that no agricultural development that could be economically undertaken within the Protectorate could possibly compensate for the loss of the best grazing land in the whole area.5. The loss of the Haud and the Reserved Area is therefore a mortaleconomic blow to the Somalis. It may be said that they still enjoy the use of boththe Haud and the Reserved Area and with qualifications that is certainly true.It must be remembered nevertheless that they only do so in constant fear of beingmolested and persecuted by the Ethiopians and the public execution of 7 Somalis(not it is true British Somalis, but Somalis nevertheless) in Jigjigga some months ago has undoubtedly made a profound impression, as also did the case ofMohamed Bogorreh. I will deal with the present situation in the Haud and reserved Area at a later stage in this report.6. Apart from the economic aspect, the Somalis feel a real sense of injusticeover this matter. Rightly or wrongly they have always regarded these territories as an integral part of the Protectorate. The fact that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenthas allowed the Ethiopians to resume the administration there, they regard as agrievous betrayal of trust.7. Whilst there is a demand for political and economic advance amongst al!sections of the community, it is, as one might expect, most vociferous amongst thesmall number of professional politicians. There is one main political party inthe Protectorate at the present time, namely the National United Front which has for the time being more or less absorbed the Somali Youth League and SomaliNational League, though how long this alliance will last is a matter for conjecture.Its chief spokesman is Mr. Michael Mariano. Its official policy is first and foremostthe return of the Haud and the Reserved Area; secondly, independence for british somali land and, thirdly, association with Somalia.8. The demand for independence is conditioned by two particular factors.First, there is a strong feeling that if Somaliland were an independent State thedispute with Ethiopia over the Haud and Reserved Area could be taken to international arbitration with a good chance of success.  The fact that this view* Not printed.
is over-optimistic does not affect the strength of Somali feeling on this point. Nextthere is the feeling that they must not be left behind Somalia and that whenSomalia becomes independent they should be in as strong a position as their neighbours, both politically and economically, in any negotiations that may takeplace regarding association. It is the same basic feeling which is behind thedemand for a timetable for self-government and more definite financial commitments in respect of development by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.9. The party, like all political parties, has its different sections. There arethe tribal rulers whose main concern is the restoration of the Haud and the reserved Area and to whom political advance is on the whole subsidiary. Thereare the extremists whose main preoccupation like that of the Somali Youth Leagueis the earliest possible independence regardless of their readiness for it and,finally, there are the moderates of whom Mariano is leader, who although just asanxious for independence as the extremists, would probably if left to themselvesbe rather more reasonable about the method of achieving it and the pace at whichit can be achieved.10. In any assessment of the political situation mention must be made ofthe Somali Officials&apos; Union. In the Somali Officials&apos; Union, as one would naturallyexpect at this stage of the Protectorate^ development, is found a large proportionof the most intelligent and level-headed Somalis. It is significant, leaving asidetheir direct personal interest in achieving a speedy acceleration of the entry ofSomalis into the higher posts of Government, that they are widely regarded astaking a no less advanced line than the political parties on the burning questionsof the Haud and Reserved Area, and of the future pace of constitutional andeconomic development vis-a-vis Somalia. After talking informally with variousSomali officials, I have little doubt that they do in fact feel very strongly on these points. It was indeed reported to me that one or two of the more prominentSomali officials were considering whether to resign or not in order to enter thepolitical fray.11. Generally, although there is much talk of independence there is I believeamongst the ordinary people little realisation of its implications, and in practice Ibelieve at the present time most of them are not really looking much further aheadthan internal self-government and would be much distressed and shocked if ourprotection and, above all, our financial assistance, were suddenly removed.12. In the economic and social field, there is a quite genuine demand amongstall sections of the community that more should be done for them. There is nodoubt that the money which we have spent in the Protectorate compares veryunfavourably with what the Italians have spent in Somalia although much of theItalian expenditure has been for the shop window. For example, I was frequentlytold about the 200 primary schools built by the Italians compared with the numberbuilt by us in the Protectorate. This view exaggerates both the number and quality of the Italian primary schools, and ignores the fact that Italian numbers are, ascompared with Somaliland, out of balance with their single intermediate and singlesecondary schools. It is probably true therefore to say that what money we have spent we have spent more wisely than the Italians. Nor do the Somalis take intoaccount the superior natural advantages of Somalia which has two rivers. Noragain do they remember that education in the Protectorate was held up for manyyears by the violent campaign against it waged by their own religious leaders or that agriculture was similarly handicapped by the prejudices of the graziers.Nevertheless the fact remains that insufficient development, either social or economic, has in point of fact taken place and in any case the Somalis are veryconscious of this.13. Finally in this connection it should be noted that Mr. Mariano hasbeen very imprudent over the question of development. When he returned from london, although no specific financial promises were made to him by the Secretaryof State, he told everybody that he had got  5 million out of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment over the next 5 years. It is conceivable that he misunderstood theallocation of  1 million from Colonial Development and Welfare funds over thenext 5 years and took it to mean  1 million a year for the next 5 years. It isalso possible that he deliberately misrepresented the fact in order to maintain hisprestige with the extremists.
The Policy Statement14. Towards the end of my visit I was authorised by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to make a statement of future policy and this I did over HargeisaRadio on Tuesday, 29th May. I had had one meeting with the Elders and NationalUnited Front leaders in Hargeisa the day after my arrival and had met them on various social occasions in the interval. They had asked, however, for a further meeting after the making of the policy statement in order that they might havean opportunity of discussing it with me, and I had arranged to set aside the wholeI of Wednesday morning for this purpose. Half an hour before this meeting was dueto take place I received a letter from the National United Front expressing theirbitter disappointment with the statement and informing me that in thecircumstances they felt that no useful purpose could be served in having themeeting. As a result Mr. Stebbing, thq Chief Secretary, and Mr. Morgan of theColonial Office, met the leaders of the National United Front and expressed tothem my disappointment at the discourtesy and also the irresponsibility of their action. As a result they later asked if they might see me after all, and I ultimatelymet them for half an hour during the afternoon.15. The sharp reaction of the National United Front was a considerablesurprise to the Governor and all of his officials. They had none of them expectedthat the statement would be acclaimed, not because the offers which it made wereunreasonable, but because no politician dared express unqualified approval of any statement which did not offer immediate independence and an annual grant of 10 million a year. They had not, however, expected that the National united front would take so extreme a line and the cause of this reaction was not immediately apparent to any of us. In the course of their conversations with theleaders of the National United Front, the Chief Secretary and Mr. Morgan elicitedthat although there were a number of subsidiary causes for their disappointmentwith the statement notably the absence of any timetable for progress towards self-government and the absence of any figures relating to the aid which her majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to give the main reason for their boycott of the meeting had been in order to demonstrate their bitter disappointment atthe lack of any reference to the return of the Haud and the Reserved Area in thestatement, and that since they had avoided any other demonstrations during my visit they felt that they must make this protest before I left. They indicatedincidentally that the protest was not aimed at me personnally, but at Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment as a whole.16. During the brief meeting in the afternoon the question of the Haud wasnot further discussed and they contented themselves with asking for certainassurances regarding the statement itself. They asked in the first place that thestatement should be published as a White Paper. I pointed out that this wasnot usual where a statement had been made personally by a Minister, but they attached such importance to it, that, whilst fully safeguarding my position, Ipromised them that I would give it further consideration. They asked, secondly,that the statement should be repeated in Parliament and I gave them an assurance that this would be done. They next asked for early publication of details of thedevelopment plan and the amount of money that is to be spent. In view of hisvery imprudent promises in this respect to which I have already referred, Marianois under heavy pressure on this point, and it was agreed that as soon as ever the plans were finalised they should be announced either by the Governor or inthe new Legislative Council, whichever was most agreeable to the National united front leaders. They asked that a Development Board with Somali members upon it should be set up and this the Governor expressed his willingness to do, probablyas a sort of sub-committee of the Legislative Council. After I left Mr. Morganalso gave them certain explanations regarding development finance and the methodsof constitutional development, which he says they appeared to receive with satisfaction: he has reported separately on this.Economic Development17. In the course of my visit I was able to see a certain amount of thecountry and, although I did not go into either the Haud or the Reserved Area, Iwas able to see the country adjoining, which is fairly similar.   The greater part
of the Protectorate is arid and waterless and water is the key to any agricultural development that we can do there. The Somalis have an idea that there is waterover wide areas which could be used if we were prepared to spend sufficient money on drilling wells, &amp;c. Something can be done, and must be done, on these lines,but the Somalis&apos; own ideas of what can be achieved are greatly exaggerated.18. There is however a great deal I believe that could be done by makingthe maximum use of the rainfall through dams and bunds. Near Borama I sawa valley which had been bunded in this way and where excellent crops of sorghum gwere being grown, and I have no doubt that a great deal more on these lines couldbe done. Indeed the District Commissioner, Borama, believes that in this way the protectorate could be made completely self-sufficient in sorghum within acomparatively short space of time.19. Similarly there is probably a reasonable future for date gardens whichequally might make the Protectorate self-sufficient in dates. I am sure that theseagricultural development schemes should now be pursued with vigour not only because economically they are most important to the Protectorate, but also becausethey would be widespread and a large number of people could see with their owneyes the work that was going on. From the propaganda point of view this is mostimportant, and I was interested to see the effect that even a few tractors had onthe minds of the local people.20. There is a rather expensive scheme for the development of the Port ofBerbera. Certain aspects of this may need further investigation but benefits will certainly come from it although they will only be apparent to a limited, thoughimportant, section of the population.Education21. There is a growing demand for education which I am sure we have gotto try to satisfy. The publication of a target of 200 scholarships was very well received. Whilst I do not propose here to discuss the problems of education inany detail, it is fair to say that, whilst there is a need for more schools everywhere,the chief need is for more intermediate and secondary schools.22. There is also a serious problem over the question of teachers. Owing tothe shortage of schools there are not at present sufficient Somali teachers for eventhe existing, let alone an expanded, educational programme. Since there is nowritten Somali language and since some Arabic is needed for religious purposes,there is a tendency to look to Egypt for teachers. This is a danger which somehowor other we have got to overcome. It is a real problem since the sources ofobtaining properly qualified Arab teachers are very limited, but somehow or other the gap between the present time and the time when the flow of Somali teachersbegins to make itself felt must be bridged. It is, moreover, most important that theeducation programme should go ahead quickly.23. In this connection it is worth considering again the whole question of theintroduction of a written Somali language. This is an old problem and thedifficulty has always been that the Somalis, both in British Somaliland and Somalia,are quite unable to agree whether Arabic or Roman script should be used and, ifthe latter, which of the three possible varieties. If we wait for the Somalis to agreewe shall never get a written Somali language. On the other hand, if we take theplunge and introduce in the Protectorate a written language with a Roman script,it is possible that, despite a good deal of initial criticism, the idea would appeal toSomali national pride and be followed in Somalia. And if it came off it wouldhave the great advantage of making the use of Arabic unnecessary in the schools,though, of course, Arabic would continue to be taught in the Koranic schools forreligious purposes.The Problem in the Protectorate24. We are undoubtedly in an extremely difficult position in the Protectorateat the present time. It would I believe be quite unrealistic to think that you cantell the Somalis that they must face the facts of life and forget about the Haud
and the Reserved Area. They are not prepared to do so and are determined ifpossible to take their case to the United Nations and to take any other steps whichare open to them to regain the lost territories. One of the greatest disasters ofthis whole business is the loss of confidence in Great Britain that has resulted from this event. They are now very doubtful about our ability to protect themagainst the Ethiopians and are sceptical of any promises unless they are given soprecisely that there is no chance of our wriggling out of them.25. Our only hope is therefore to divert their thoughts as far as possible into other fields, such as political advance and development, and it is of the first importance that we should really get moving with the promises made in the policystatement. Financial assistance from Her Majesty&apos;s Government will of course be essential. It was clear during my visit that recent assistance to Cyprus, jordan and the High Aswan Dam has not gone unnoticed by the Somalis, and if they donot themselves receive reasonably generous treatment there is clearly a danger that they will draw their own conclusions. Even so there is one great difficulty,namely, their renewed demand to be allowed to take their case to the international court. When I was in Hargeisa, I deliberately held up the proposed reply to this demand since to have made that reply at that particular moment would have been completely disastrous from the point of view of the policy statement. Nevertheless,a reply cannot now be long delayed, and if it is unfavourable there is thereal danger that at the present moment they may refuse co-operation with theGovernment including possibly a boycott of the new Legislative Council andit is almost certain that they will turn a much more attentive ear to hostile propa-ganda.  This will also have a damaging effect upon our prestige in Somalia.Present Situation in the Haud and Reserved Area26. During my visit, although I did not go into the Haud or the ReservedArea, I went out to the frontier adjacent to both and at Tug Wajale I met MohamedBogorreh, who has now been safely returned to the bosom of his people. I also had the opportunity of having discussions with Mr. Drysdale and Mr. Hilliard,the Liaison Officers concerned. In the Haud at the present moment things aretolerably peaceful, not I think because of any change of heart by the Ethiopians,but because they have realised that it is impossible to stop the people crossing the frontier and that it is much more difficult in the Haud to establish a case thattribes are sedentary. Finally, the Ethiopian police, which is more or lesssynonymous with the Army, is concentrated on the Somalia border owing to thefrontier dispute with Somalia and there are comparatively few police in the Haudat the present time.27. In the Reserved Area things are very different. Here it has become increasingly clear that the Ethiopians have not the slightest intention of observingthe spirit of the 1954 Agreement. I understand from Mr. Drysdale that none ofthe minor Ethiopian officials have even heard of what went on during the conversations at Addis Ababa, that Colonel Kifle has not been near the area sincethose conversations and that in the meantime the Ethiopians are encouraging theGadabursi, one of our tribes, to plough up land. This breaks the clause of theAgreement which prohibits the restriction of grazing, and the object of thismanoeuvre is fairly simple. If the land is ploughed up it is easy to say that thepeople who have ploughed it up are sedentary and do not come under theAgreement. The eventual object no doubt is to get the whole of the Reserved Areaploughed up, whereupon the Ethiopians will claim all those living there asEthiopian subjects and say that the 1954 Agreement is no longer applicable to anypart of the area. Nor is it easy for us to do a great deal about it. Although we know that the Gadabursi tribe are being actively encouraged by the Ethiopians toplough up land by a combination of threats and blandishments, it is very difficultto get positive proof. If, as we should like to do, we were to go in and arrest ourown tribesmen who are ploughing up traditional grazing lands, the Ethiopianswould immediately claim them as Ethiopian subjects, and there is evidence that many of these people in return for being allowed to plough up the land are beingobliged to make their mark on a document certifying that they are of Ethiopiannationality.28. For these reasons, although there is a strong demand in the Protectoratethat the Protectorate Government should be allowed to take more positive action
to stop what is going on, such action presents real problems. However, I have nodoubt that we must consider what can be done and that we probably have enoughevidence to enter an early protest with the Ethiopian Government at their failure to implement any of the promises which they gave in Addis Ababa.Ethiopian Policy29. Even so, I very much doubt whether any amount of diplomatic activityby Great Britain alone will have much effect. It is difficult to be certain aboutEthiopian policy, but the impression one gets is that the Ethiopians are determined to cling to the Haud and the Reserved Area as a bargaining counter to be used to persuade the Somalis to some sort of association with Ethiopia after 1960.Although this is purely conjecture it is fair to say that the absorption of the Somalishas always been an Ethiopian dream ever since the days of Menelik. Moreover,when I was in Rome the Italians told me that the Ethiopians were deliberatelymore forthcoming to the Somalis when the Italians were not present than whenthey were and that the Ethiopian delegates deliberately indicated to the Somalisthat they would be prepared to be much more accommodating once the Somaliswere independent.Future Policy in the Horn of Africa30. At the present moment we do not appear to have any very definite policyin the Horn of Africa as a whole. It is I believe the policy of the United states to support the Ethiopians as the only stable force in the Horn of Africa and, aslong as the United States continue to take a pro-Ethiopian line in all circumstances,it is very difficult for us to bring much pressure upon the Ethiopians. Yet, unlesseffective pressure is brought upon them over the Haud and Reserved Area thereis a serious danger that the Somalis both in the Protectorate and in Somalia willbe estranged and they will be driven into the arms of Egypt. If this should happenwe shall probably be faced in the early 1960&apos;s or before with an extremely serious situation in the Horn of Africa: an, as always, unstable regime in Ethiopia will find itself ringed by hostile Islamic peoples, widely subverted by Egyptian influence,from Eritrea right round to the Somalis in the Northern Province of Kenya; as aresult traditional Sudanese hostility to the Ethiopians will without doubt be stimulated; British and indeed Western influence among the Somali peoples islikely to have been reduced to negligible proportions, because we will have shownourselves in Somali eyes to have betrayed their interests and to have been incapable of recovering their territory for them; the measure of Egyptian and possibly Sovietinfluence which will by then exist in the Somali area of the Horn of Africa willconstitute a grave threat to our strategic interests in East Africa and of course in Aden; similarly it will constitute a grave threat to our potential oil interest inthe Somaliland Protectorate, Somalia and even in the Ethiopian Ogaden.31. This is clearly a situation which must be avoided. One way of avoidingit might be to back the Ethiopians wholeheartedly and to allow and even assist them to absorb the Somalis, which is what they themselves would like to do. Thishowever would constitute a major betrayal of people whom we are bound toprotect, a betrayal which in itself seems to me quite unthinkable and which wouldbe so manifest that it might have serious repercussions in other Colonial territories and in other Islamic countries. If this view is accepted the only alternative wouldappear to be to assist the Somalis to achieve their own real ambition which is a united Somali State, either completely independent or within the Commonwealth.There are risks and difficulties in this policy also:  (a) to implement it, pressure will have to be put upon the Ethiopians to give up the Haud and the Reserved Area.  The Ethiopians will certainlydislike this and the Americans may dislike it;(b) the French are opposed to the idea because they fear it would create ademand in Jibuti for incorporation within the new State;(c) the Italians would not oppose an independent Somali State but would strongly resent it coming within the Commonwealth;(d) unless oil is found neither Somalia nor the Protectorate are viable and money would have to be provided from somewhere. An Anglo-Italian-Ethiopian consortium is the obvious solution but the inclusion of
Ethiopia would not be acceptable to the Somalis. An Anglo-Italianconsortium is a possibility but would not be acceptable to the ethiopians. In any case our financial commitment would inevitably be greater than at present. When I was in Rome I tried to find out from the Italians how much money they would be prepared to put up after 1960. The impression I got was that although they would beprepared to put up some money they would not be prepared to put upanything like the amount which they are at present contributing. Onthe other hand if you do not have a consortium of friendly Powersthere is a grave risk that you may get a new State financed by, andunder the influence Of, unfriendly Powers.32. On the assumption however that an independent Somali State is what we are aiming for and that these difficulties and dangers could be overcome, weare still confronted with the greatest difficulty of all. If we turn down the Somalislatest appeal over the Haud there is a definite risk that they will turn elsewherefor assistance. It is true that on the last occasion Egypt refused to support their application at U.N.O. but there is no guarantee that the Egyptians may not change their mind. It is therefore of the first importance that we should do somethingabout the Haud and the Reserved Area.Future Policy Haud and the Reserved Area33. If we are to pursue this policy something must be done to solve theproblem of the Haud and the Reserved Area. We cannot allow the ProtectorateTreaties with the Somalis to become the subject of an advisory opinion by theInternational Court, because this would open the way to demands for the submission to the Court of all and any Protectorate Treaties, including those onwhich is based our position in the Aden Protectorate and Uganda. Nor can weadmit the competence of the United Nations to interfere in any way in respect ofthe 1897 Treaty between Ethiopia and ourselves. Since we ourselves maintain that this Treaty is valid in international law, the only grounds on which we couldjustify or defend an appeal to the United Nations would be that the situationwhich has arisen since the Treaty was signed is inequitable. This, however, wouldbe very dangerous to us in other interests. For example, it is exactly what the greeks have been saying in the case of Cyprus. I do not see any form ofinternational arbitration which we could accept and we must face having to make this clear to the Somalis.34. Is there any alternative method of persuading the Ethiopians to give up their sovereignty over the Haud and the Reserved Area? There is an area in theNorthern Province of Kenya which we might be able to offer to the Ethiopians in exhange for all or some of the Haud or the Reserved Area. However in anyfurther negotiations I am convinced that the Americans must be enlisted on our side. As long as the Ethiopians can count upon American support against usnothing will be achieved. If an approach were to be made to the Americans itcould be on the following lines:  (a) the historical background to the situation, including all the efforts we havemade since 1944 by friendly diplomatic means to achieve a satisfactory solution with the Ethiopians;(b) a full explanation why, if the general Somaliland/Ethiopia (and Somalia/Ethiopia) frontier cannot very soon be placed on a satisfactory footing,we shall find ourselves faced in the early 1960&apos;s or before with a disastrous situation in the Horn of Africa;(c) our own policy for the Horn of Africa; this briefly being the eventualestablishment of some sort of Somali Union in the area under eitherBritish or Western influence, and at the same time the maintenance of friendly relations with an Ethiopia which we hope can be persuaded to divert the energies at present directed towards external expansion intothe more fruitful fields of internal consolidation and development;(d) our own offer, if it can be made, of the exchange of Kenya territory forthe Haud and Reserved Area.
35. I realise that this proposal is open to objection. It will be argued thatthe Americans are unlikely to agree and it may be argued that the only result offurther pressure on the Ethiopians would be to drive them into the Russian camp.On neither of these points do I feel qualified to express an opinion. What doesseem essential, however, is :  (a) that we should have a definite policy which can be implemented by our representatives in Addis Ababa, Hargeisa and Mogadishu.  close co-operation between them is I believe essential; I(b) that the aim of the policy should be to keep both the Soraalis andEthiopians within the sphere of Western influence;(c) that in view of the necessity of giving the Somalis a reply regarding theirlatest demand to be allowed to take their case to the international court, we should take an early decision as to what we intend to do.Colonial Office,25 th June, 1956.
APPENDIX BPOLICY STATEMENT FOR SOMALILAND PROTECTORATE(Issued in the Somaliland Protectorate on May 29th, 1956)Government is aware that recent political developments have made the peopleof the Somaliland Protectorate keenly desirous to learn the future policy of her majesty&apos;s Government towards the Protectorate and in the Somali area in general.I have accordingly obtained authority of the Secretary of State to make thefollowing statement. The details of policy still remain to be examined in many important matters, particularly in regard to finance, but this statement will provide an indication of the general intention of Her Majesty&apos;s Government. The detailsof implementation of the policy to be followed within this general fraamework willbe subject to consultation with responsible Somali leaders from time to time.2. (a) The aim of Her Majesty&apos;s Government is to press ahead witheconomic, social and political progress in the Protectorate. In particular her majesty&apos;s Government has decided that steps must be taken to acceleratedevelopment of education and economic resources within the limits of the physicalcapacity of the territory to undertake them.(b) In the field of education plans already exist for expanding elementary,intermediate and secondary education and technical training facilities; they will bediscussed with the Secretary of State&apos;s Educational Adviser when he visits the protectorate this autumn. Up to 200 overseas scholarships and training courses, inaddition to those originally planned for the period ending 1960, will be providedsubject to there being sufficient suitably qualified candidates. These scholarshipsare intended to cover all branches of education and include university and professional training of Somali students, technical training and apprenticeshipoverseas and provision for administrative and technical courses for serving Somalimembers in all branches of the Civil Service.(c) In the development of economic resources particular attention will bepaid to providing adequate water supplies both in the towns and in the interior, andto agricultural, irrigation, forestry and soil and water conservation projects bywhich grazing and natural vegetation will be improved and the Protectorate madeless dependent on imported foodstuffs. It is hoped to improve outlets for livestock,skins and other livestock products, and schemes for an abattoir and cold store atBerbera are being investigated. Berbera port will be developed, and the search foroil and minerals of economic value encouraged. Every effort will be made todevelop a stable and self-supporting economy and modern social services within thelimits of Protectorate resources.3. The primary object of all of these developments is to make the Somalis ofthe Protectorate ready for internal self-government. Her Majesty&apos;s Government isnot, however, laying down a definite time-table for political advances, and indeed it is believed that responsible Somalis themselves would not wish this to be done.Her Majesty&apos;s Government will, however, review the position in consultation withthe people of the Protectorate within a reasonable time after 1960.4. Her Majesty&apos;s Government will therefore take every practical step toencourage Somalis to assume greater political responsibility. A Legislative council with certain powers over legislation and finance will be introduced within thecoming twelve months and local government councils will be progressivelyestablished throughout the Protectorate. The expansion in educational servicesand particularly the increase in oversea scholarships have been planned to secureamong other things an acceleration of the process of the Somalis entering into posts in higher branches of the Civil Service.5. Somali leaders in the Protectorate have made enquiries concerning theviews of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the possibility of some form of association between Somaliland and Somalia sometime after 1960. When the time comes to consider such matters the views of the Somalis concerned will be one ofthe factors of decisive importance in determining Her Majesty&apos;s governments attitude towards any proposals which may be put forward on this subject. her majesty&apos;s Government would certainly discuss any such proposals withrepresentatives of the people of the Protectorate; and, if political and economic
conditions were propitious, and the proposals were both well-conceived andfavoured by the Somalis concerned, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be ready tosupport them in principle.6. The Protectorate^ territorial integrity is guaranteed for as long as theterritory remains under the protection of Her Majesty&apos;s Government and indeedHer Majesty&apos;s Government wishes to emphasise that she will certainly not withdrawher protection as long as the Somali people require it.APPENDIX CI. Recent Incidents in the Haud and Reserved Area affecting the Working of the1954 agreement. At the beginning of July groups of Habr withdrawal British Protected tribesmenwere threatened with withdrawal of their grazing and watering rights if they didnot accept Ethiopian nationality.2. A meeting of the Habr withdrawal was called by Ethiopian officials without consulting the Liaison Officer. At this meeting two Ethiopian sponsored Sultanswere appointed. Threats and bribes were used to get tribesmen to attend andaccept these Sultans. Similar incidents have occurred in many other british protected tribes.3. Representatives of British Protected tribes were taken to Jigjigga, met bysenior Ethiopian officials, given clothing, and sent to Addis Ababa where they were told they would meet the Emperor.4.   These actions represent two clear breaches of the 1954 Agreement:  (1) The Ethiopians have failed to seek the advice of the Liaison Officer in theconduct of their affairs with the tribes;(2) An Ethiopian tribal organisation has been partly set up in interference withthe British organisation set up by the Somaliland Government which theagreement states &quot; shall continue to function &quot; in the Territories.5. The threat to withdraw grazing rights is a threat to break the 1954Agreement and the 1897 Treaty itself.II. Other Serious Incidents in the Haud and Reserved Area6. All persons in Aw Barreh suspected of British nationality were seen by theDistrict Governor and those with passports interrogated and the passports taken away; those who had sent in application forms were told to produce the forms onthreat of arrest.7. There have also been reports that Ethiopian tribes have been lootingBritish tribes in the Territories with the support of the Ethiopian police. TheGovernor has made no report of this.III. The Esa Massacre8. A delegation of Esa tribesmen recently reached the Protectorate and reported that in February about 400 of their tribe had beeen massacred byEthiopian police and troops using aircraft and armoured cars. During the fighting the women and children, who are normally not touched in fighting between the tribes and the police and who had therefore been left unprotected by the men,were mutilated and killed. Most .6f the Esa concerned were an Ethiopian sectionof the tribe and the incident took place well within Ethiopian territory (not in the1954 Agreement Territories). There were, however, a few members of a british protected section of the tribe.
