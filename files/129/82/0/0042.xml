Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1956SECRETCP. (56) 19228th July, 1956&apos; \\  &apos;cabinet united KINGDOM COMMERCIAL policy memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and thePresident of the Board of TradeIt may be helpful if we set out some of the reasons which have led us to believethat the policy described in the interim report circulated with CP. (56) 191 isdeserving of serious study by our colleagues.2. In recent years our policy has been based in part upon the principlesof multilateral trade embodied in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Tradeand in part upon the principles of preference enshrined at Ottawa. Both systemshave advantages and both are under pressure.3. In Europe the &quot; Messina &quot; countries are proposing the establishment ofa common market. If we stay out, and this market is established, it would confrontus with a powerful bloc discriminating in tariffs against us and dominated byWestern Germany. In the Commonwealth there is already a natural tendency for the system of Imperial Preference to erode. Australia, our largest market,has made proposals, which we shall not be able altogether to resist, to scale down the whole range of our preference margins.4. We have already arranged for exploratory studies in September between ourselves, together with other European countries, and the &quot; Messina &quot; countries.We have been engaged in negotiations with Australia which are due to be resumed in September.5. Various policies have been considered. For our part we see substantialmerit in a scheme to associate this country, and if possible the Scandinavian anda number of other European countries, with the common market in a free trade area. To safeguard both British agriculture and important commonwealth interests in the United Kingdom market, agricultural and horticultural productswould be excluded. The course is described and analysed in the interim reportby officials, circulated with CP. (56) 19.1. Briefly, it would involve the gradualremoval by the United Kingdom and the common market countries of their tariffand other restrictions against each other. The United Kingdom would retaintariffs against third countries and the right to maintain Commonwealth free entry.6., Such a course, while it would gradually over a period of ten or fifteen yearsexpose British industry fully to European competition competition which itanyway has to meet in third markets, would have substantial advantages:  (i) it would be a creative and imaginative policy which might well steer afresh course for a generation; it would make it possible to bring about,under our own control, the inevitable adjustments in our Commonwealthtrading arrangements;(ii) it would open to our own industries the opportunities of a large market,on a preferential basis, comparable in size and resources to those ofthe United States and the Soviet Union, and bring with it the stimulusof increasing contact and competition with the industries of theContinent;Copy No. 2 850246
(iii) it would leave us free to retain for the Commonwealth free entry to theUnited Kingdom market, together with the agricultural preferenceswhich the Dominions now enjoy, and on manufactured goods anypreferences over imports from foreign countries outside Europe. Inreturn, we could reasonably hope to retain at least as large a part of ourpreferences in Dominion markets as we are likely to keep by a continuation of existing policies;(iv) in times of prosperity, we would be able to make the most of ouropportunities and would be better equipped to face any severerecession in the United States;(v) internationally we would establish our commercial leadership of europe and open the way for greater European unity, without Germanhegemony.7. The scheme raises many problems, technical and political. Yet to do nothing might be the most dangerous course of all. We might forfeit our influence over commercial policy in Europe and be left with only the remnants of imperial preference. The Opposition would attribute our loss of Commonwealth advantages to our refusal to continue State trading and to our adherence to the principlesof multilateral trade. Both Parties would condemn us for missing our opportunitiesand for want of initiative.8. Provided that we do not delay our lead too late, the situation appears topresent us with a considerable opportunity. We have a chance which might notrecur of gaining the general support of what may be described as both the european and the Imperial wings of the Conservative Party. Contact with the Federation ofBritish Industries and other industrial advisers leads us to suppose that a policy ofthis character, if it can be worked out, would not lack substantial industrial support.9. We should aim to make policy decisions early in September when we shallstill be in a position to shape events.H. M.P. T.27th July, 1956.i
