DOCUMENT IS THE property OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret P. (56) 10820th July, 1956.COPY NO.OS5CABINETCAPITAL EXPENDITURE ON HOSPITALSMemorandum by the Minister of health i have been unable to agree with the Chancellor of the exchequer the level of expenditure to be permitted on hospital building in Englandand Wales in 1958/59, and I am therefore submitting the matter to theCabinet.    I do so now, as it will be impossible for Hospital Boards to spend the money unless they have adequate time for preEminary planning.An announcement to them is already overdue.2. The table which follows sets out the capital allocated to hospital building in 1956/57, that already announced for 1957/58, andthat which I had proposed for 1958/59 to the Social Services Committeein March.    For the convenience of the Cabinet I have divided it for eachyear into expenditure on major schemes (including those announced by my predecessor last year); money specifically reserved for &quot;revenue-saving&quot; schemes;   and sums provided to Hospital Boards for schemescosting less than  250, 000.Year	Major Schemes	Revenue-saving Schemes	Schemes costing less than  250,000	Total	 m.	 m.	 m.	 m.1956/57	2	2	9	131957/58	4	4	10	181958/59	6	3	12	21A large part of the amount to be spent in each year consists of carry over from the previous year.    Thus about  5^ millions for major schemes and  6 millions for schemes costing less than  250,000will be spent in 1958/59 on schemes already in progress at the beginningof that year,3. The Chancellor has agreed the  3 millions for revenue-savingschemes and the  6 millions for major schemes (which includes only -! million for new major works).    Our disagreement relates to theexpenditure on schemes costing less than  250,000 which include almost all the programme of modernising hospitals, particularly mental hospitals.    The Chancellor proposes to allow  10 millions.    with considerable reluctance I have offered to reduce my requirement forthat year to  11 millions, provided that the possibility of restoring my
original figure of  12 millions can be looked at again if the economicsituation improves before 1958/59. To go further would force us toretard our programme of essential modernisation.4. I have tried to limit my proposals to the barest minimum necessary to continue the programme started by my predecessor.I wish to remind my colleagues of certain facts(a) The conditions at many of our hospitals are very unsatisfactory, some of them being an inheritancefrom the old poor law days.(b) In certain places we are still making use of wartimehutted hospitals that cannot be kept weatherproof.(c) A large number of our mental and mental deficiencyhospitals are over a century old and lack modernconveniences.(d) Overcrowding in mental hospitals is serious.    a figure of 40 per cent on the female side is notuncommon.(e) Shortage of beds for the chronic sick is filling the mental hospitals with old people who could be housedelsewhere.(f) Our policy of restricting the number of hostels that localwelfare authorities can build under Part III of the national assistance Act, 1948, is aggravating the problem.(g) The number of old people who have to be cared forwill increase considerably in the next few years.An announcement that our programme is to be retarded will cause consternation, and we shall be in danger of a breakdown in thehospital service.5. My proposals for 1958/59 provide a rate of hospital capitalbuilding two-thirds of the pre-war rate.    The Guillebaud committee recommended  30 millions as the level of hospital capital expenditure inGreat Britain after 1957/58.    &quot;Whilst I appreciate that in present economic circumstances this target is unattainable, I am convinced that we shouldhave it in sight before this Parliament ends.Though we cannot go forward at the moment, to retreat from ourpresent modest programme would be disastrous.    The amount spent in any year depends greatly on the carry over from previous years;  a retreat inconsequence prevents a future advance.6. I hope therefore that the Cabinet will endorse my view that theexpenditure on schemes costing less than  250, 000 in England and wales in 1958/59 should be not less than  11 millions.R.H,T,Ministry of Health, W. 1.20th July, 1956.
