[SHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P. (56) 154 COPY NO.27th June, 1956CABINETINTERNATIONAL TIN COUNCIL,Memorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the President of the Beard of trade the International Tin Council is likely to come into beingshortly.    It will be established under the International Tin Agreement(CMD. 9222) negotiated in 1953, for the purposes of stabilising the priceof tin and ensuring adequate supplies at reasonable prices at all times.Signature of the Agreement was subject to ratification and the lastcountry needed to enable the agreement to be brought into force(Indonesia) has now ratified.    A meeting of Governments which have ratified is being summoned in London on 29th June, and if, as expected,it is then decided that the Agreement shall come into force on 1st July,the first meeting of the Council will be held on 2nd July.2. The Tin Council will be situated in London, and we are facedwith proposals from other Governments and from the Interim Committeeof the Tin Council for immunity from income tax in respect of the funds of the Council and the salaries of its employees, and for otherimmunities, which require immediate consideration.3, The Council will receive income in the form of subscriptionsfrom member countries, and possibly interest on investments, and alsooperate a buffer-stock of tin, which it will buy and sell to steady theprice.    For this and general purposes the Tin Council will requireappropriate capacity to function as a legal entity in the United Kingdom.Moreover, the operation of the buffer-stock (which is not a feature ofany existing international organisation) would for income tax and profits tax purposes be regarded as trading, and, unless granted immunity,the Council will be liable to tax both on this part of its income and oninterest etc. on its general funds.     Its employees also would be liablein respect of their salaries.4, When the Agreement was negotiated in 1953 the cabinet agreed that the British Delegation should be instructed to resist stronglyany proposal that the staff of the Council should be exempted from income tax, and only to offer to exempt the buffer-stock funds from united Kingdom income tax and profits tax if this were necessary tosecure agreement that the Tin Council should be established in London.(C.C. (53) 63rd Conclusions, Minute 5).5. The provisions about status and taxation which wereultimately embodied in the Agreement were as follows:-&quot;Article IV (21).    The Council shall have in eachparticipating country, to the extent consistent withits law, such legal capacity as may be necessary for thedischarge of its functions under this Agreement,,
&quot;Article IV (22).    The Council shall have in eachparticipating country, to the extent consistent withits law, such exemption from taxation on the assets,income and other property of the Council and onremuneration paid by the Council to its employeesas may be necessary for the discharge of its functions under this Agreement&quot;.This rather vague provision in Article IV (22) was agreed to by other delegations in the light of a statemeit by the United Kingdom Delegate,who said, as regards taxation of the Council&apos;s assets, income andother property, that &quot;lie could not commit his Government to grantingexemption from taxation but if the Conference adopted his Delegationssuggestion, he was confident that if any difficulties arose they would bedealt with sensibly and reasonably&quot;.    On the taxation of employees&apos;salaries the United Kingdom Delegate is recorded as having stated thatthe United Kingdom Government had serious objections to exemption,and that he saw no prospect of its being granted.    Indeed the UnitedKingdom Delegate in agreeing to the inclusion of a reference toemployees&apos; remuneration in Article IV (22), askedthatit should be clearly stated in the record of the meeting that there was no prospect of her majesty&apos;s Government agreeing to grant tax exemption to employees.The official record, however, does not show clearly that this attitude was maintained.6. It is reasonably plain that the Conference agreed to the choice of London as the seat of the Council, in the belief that the Council&apos;s funds would be exempt from taxation as would also the operations of the buffer-stock.    Indeed, if the Conference had thought there was any doubt aboutexemption it is quite probable that agreement would not have been securedat all or, at any rate, that agreement to London as the seat of the council would not have been obtained.7. At the 4th Session of the Interim. Committee of the Council heldin London on 27th February, 1956, the following resolution was passed(with the United Kingdom and the British Colonial Territories which areindependently represented abstaining):-&quot;(a)    that it is necessary for the International Tin Council,in order to discharge its functions under theInternational Tin Agreement, to have in the UnitedKingdom the legal capacities of a body corporate,immunity from legal process and exemption orrelief from taxes and ratesin respect of its funds,assets and income, including buffer-stock profits,and other property;       and(b)    that, for the International Tin Council to dischargeits functions under the International Tin Agreement,it is necessary for those members of the staff ofthe Council who are not citizens of the United Kingdomand Colonies to be exempt from taxation in the UnitedKingdom in respect of the salary and other payments,including the payment of subsistence allowances,which they shall receive from the Council11.
Legal capacity8. The Council will require the legal capacities of a body corporate at an early stage to enable it to take premises, engage staff,hold money etc.    The proper method of granting it status is by Order inCouncil, which requires an affirmative resolution under the international organisations (Immunities and Privileges) Act, 1950.    This Order shouldalso cover any immunities, including any taxation immunity, which shouldalso be granted as early as possible.    Immunity from legal process,which is claimed in the Interim Committee&apos;s resolution, is neithermentioned in nor required by the Agreement and could not thereforebe granted under the 1950 Act.Immunity from Tax9. In the light of the Cabinet&apos;s instructions to our Delegationsin 1953, and in view of the fact that the Conference believed there wouldbe no difficulty about exemption of the Councils profits from taxation,we do not think we have any alternative but to confer immunity from tax(including the non-beneficial portion of rates) on the Council&apos;s property,funds and buffer-stock operations.10. The more difficult question which arises is whether the salaries of the CounciPs employees should be exempt from tax.    There is no doubtthat a decision to grant no tax immunity to employees would prove most difficult to defend in the light of the treatment accorded to other inter-national bodies.    For example, the International Sugar Council enjoysimmunity from tax in respect of both its funds and the salaries of itsforeign employees;   and the International Wheat Councils foreignemployees were exempted also.    Both of these bodies have purposessimilar to that of the Tin Council.    It is true that these exemptions were provided for in more specific terms in the relative international agree-ments but this argument would cut no ice with foreign Governments, whowill regard themselves, if exemption is not granted, as paying a levyto the United Kingdom Government.11.        We have no doubt that the salaries of those members of theCouncil&apos;s staff who are citizens of the United Kingdom or Colonies shouldbe taxed, as for the Wheat and Sugar Councils.    With regard to the salaries of other staff (of whom there may be three or four) there areobjections to exemption.    We understand that while official tradingagencies here of other countries are exempted on their profits by virtueof their sovereign status, the law provides that the employees of these organisations should be taxed;  and it is argued that similar treatmentshould be applied to the Tin Councilrs employees.12.        On the other hand, the objectives of the Tin Council are infact similar to those of the Wheat and Sugar Councils which enjoy immunityand it is clear that this analogy will be pressed by foreign Governments.Moreover these Governments can point out that we shall get back in taxa substantial part of;our contribution to the Councils budget at theexpense of increased contributions from them - thus, in effect, making them pay a large slice of our contribution.13.        For these reasons we are of the opinion that immunity from taxation on remuneration should be granted to the foreign members ofthe staff of the Tin Council.    Only three or four members will be involved.    We also consider that any concessions should be granted assoon as possible rather than they should later be dragged out of aseemingly unwilling United Kingdom Government, possibly by the threat of the Council leaving London.
14.        No immunities except from taxation including rates are contemplated.15, The Attorney-General has advised that as Article IV (22)does not specifically require the grant of exemption from income tax on the salaries of the staff of the Council such grant wotild be ultra viresthe International Organisations (immunities and Privileges) Act, 1950,in view of the requirement of the proviso to Section I of the Act, that no greater immunity should be granted than is required to give effect tothe Agreement.16.        We therefore recommend:(a) that the International Tin Council should be giventhe legal capacities of a body corporate by meansof an Order in Council made under the international organisations (immunities and Privileges) Act, 1950;(b) that the Order should confer exemption from taxationin respect of the CounciPs general funds, assets, andother property and its buffer-stock operations;(c) that the Council should be informed that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment is legally precluded from granting exemption from income tax in respect of the emoluments of theCounciPs employees, but would be prepared to assent to a protocol to the Agreement specifically requiringsuch exemption to be conferred as in the case of theInternational V/heat Council (except for those of theCouncil&apos;s employees who are citizens of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies);     and(d) that authority therefore be given to negotiate such a protocol and, should this be concluded, to grant suchexemption by means of a further Order in Council.A draft Order in Council giving effect to (a) and (b) is attached.S.L.P,T.26th June, 1956.
