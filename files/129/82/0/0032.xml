secret,P.(56) 18219th July, 1956.&quot;1  copy NO. /&quot;&quot;/,CABINETAUSTRALIA:  TRADE TALKSMemorandum by the Minister of State, Board of trade we have reached a critical point in our talks with the australians.    When he met the Prime Minister at the end of last week,Mr, Menzies gave no sign that he would be willing to recede from theposition which Mr, McEwen, the Australian Minister of Trade, had taken up in the previous two weeks.    This was that the Australians must have:-(i) freedom to eliminate our preferences on capital goods and to reduce the rest to some undefinedminimum level;      and(ii)    certain new commitments from us which would substantially limit our freedom of action onour agricultural subsidies and our imports offoreign agricultural products.The Australians had indicated that they would eliminate our preferenceson capital goods in the very near future and that there would be a gradual reduction of our other preferences over a period of years,2. On Monday, having cancelled his projected visit to Germany,Mr. McEwen told the President that he b.ad Mr. Menzies&apos; authority toputforwarda new basis for negotiations.    While the Australians may stillpress for some discussion of their earlier proposed principles, theessential features of the new arrangement wouldbe that:-(i)    Australia would guarantee to give us a preference of5 per cent on capital goods (as against 12% per centnow) and preferences at defined levels (to be negotiated later) on other goods;        and(ii)   we should undertake to ensure that about one million tons (forty million bushels) of australian wheat (i. e. approximately the pre-war quantity)was sold here if offered at prices which werecompetitive with non-subsidised wheat from other sources.3. Mr. McEwenTs new proposals represent a definite move inour direction, though they do not leave us free from acute embarrassment.Their effect would be that instead of losing our preference on capital goods and having complete uncertainty on the rest, we should retaincontractual preferences over the whole field - though at much reducedlevels.    Against this we should have to give the Australians a precise
undertaking on wheat, which would in effect give them what they were seeking under their original proposals.4. Mr. McEwen said that this offer represented the limit towhich he and Mr. Menzies were prepared to go.    The Australian cabinet had decided before he left Australia that, if a satisfactory settlement was not agreed in principle now, they would be prepared to terminatetheir existing Ottawa Agreement with us;  and in his view they would ,almost certainly do so.5. We understand that the Australians do not envisage that weshould negotiate a final Agreement now but that we should reach agree-ment in principle now and undertake definitive negotiations later (either in November or in February 1957).    At the present stage there wouldbe two agreed documents.    The first would be a public announcementstating that the two Governments had agreed to negotiate a comprehensivenew Agreement and listing briefly and in fairly general terms the subjects which would be covered in this Agreement.    The second document,which would not be published, would specify these subjects in consider -ably more detail and would contain certain pre-defined provisionalcommitments on both sides.6. We should hope to secure a published announcement infairly general terms - though it would indicate that there was to be some reduction in our preferences in Australia.    But the wording of theunpublished document would clearly be crucial for both sides.    the australians have so far insisted that they must have a specific under-taking on wheat.    They might not insist on mentioning the actual tonnage to be covered: but they would probably press for a wording which wouldin practice commit us to guarantee them a market for something very near a million tons.    If any such commitment is given we for our partshall need equally firm commitments from the Australians on thefollowing points:-(i)    a guaranteed preference of 7-1 per cent on capital goods, and a definite commitment on our otherpreferences;(ii) an undertaking to consult and an assurance ofnon-discrimination in respect of Australianimport restrictions;    and(iii)    an acceptance of modifications in our free-entrycommitments and the withdrawal of Australia&apos;sguaranteed preferences on a few non-agricultural products.Thus as we see the position, the main outline of the final settlement -and its general balance - would have been agreed in advance and our freedom of manoeuvre at the subsequent official negotiations wouldprobably be very limited.7. It is clear that, if we are to avoid a breakdown at themeeting with Mr. Menzies on Friday, 20th July, we must be in a positionto say something about what we might offer on wheat.    We need not commit ourselves at that meeting either to a precise method or to a specific tonnage: but unless we can convince the Australians that weshall be prepared to make some substantial concession on wheat therewill be no basis for negotiation.    It will, moreover, be essential toavoid a vague formula which could mean one tiling to us and another to
the Australians;  and whatever formula is used we shall have to be clear in our minds about what we can do on wheat before the two documentsreferred to above are signed.    (The Minister of Agriculture is circulating a paper (C,P.(56) 179) on this aspect of the problem).8. I discussed the position with the President before he left for Paris and have been in touch with him by telephone since.    He isvery conscious that any arrangement on wheat which would satisfy the australians would be difficult and costly for us.    He also recognises that by making a concession on wheat we should not prevent but only mitigatea reduction in our preference - a development which we have expectedbut public opinion has not.    Nevertheless, the President considers thatfor us to reject Mr. McEwen&apos;s new proposals would not only embitterour relations with Australia but would be difficult to defend in thiscountry.    The Australians would almost certainly publish their proposalswhen they returned home and denounce the existing Agreement, putting the responsibility on us.    We could not then expect the Australians to repeat their offer of contractual margins;  and so we should be accusedby British industry of throwing away our contractual preference on capital goods (say  100 millions of trade a year) and putting all our other preferences (say  150 millions) at risk because we would notentertain an Australian request on wheat which many people in thiscountry would regard as not without justification.9. For these reasons the President urges that we tell the australians on Friday that their latest proposals offer a basis for negotiation;  and that we do our best to convince them that, subject to asatisfactory settlement on our counter-requests, we shall be preparedto enter into a commitment on wheat.A.R.W.L.Board of Trade, S.W.1.18th July, 1956.
