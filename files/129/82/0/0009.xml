I accordingly submit draft texts of   -(i)   an oral statement;&apos; (ii)   a fuller statement which i propose to circulatein the Official Report;* (iii)   notes for supplementaries.Not attached-1-
3.     You will recc.ll that Mr. Mintoff left for Malta on the morning of 23rd June without disclosing his intentions, although I had rung himup on the previous evening to urge him, as you had earlier, not to rushmatters and to talk the situation over with the Governor before decidingon any course of action which would irrevocably prejudice the plan of integration.4.      The Governor has reported by telegram the subsequent courseof events (Appendix &apos;A&apos;). *     A copy of Mr. Mintoff&apos;s speech in theLegislative Assembly on 25th June is attached   (Appendix *B!). *5.     The Governor has since sent a full assessment of thesituation (Appendix &apos;C).6.     In the light of these subsequent events, my own assessment ofthe situation is as fellows:-(1)   Superficially, the issue may seem to present itself as one ofa difference between us of only  1^ -    2 millions but that is not byany means the whcJ.e story.    Mr. Mintoff claims that a decision togive him what he wants this year would not prejudice Her Majesty&apos;governments future help or necessarily imply a guarantee of&quot;equivalence1&apos;.    I believe that both these issues would be seriouslyprejudiced by giving way now.     Increased expenditure this year made possible by increased grants from the Exchequer would createirresistible demands for similar or greater grants in the future tomaintain the new works and support the higher level of recurrent expenditure which, in the absence of the increased taxable capacityof Malta, would inevitably be entailed.    The Maltese are showing no signs now of being willing to carry out their part of the bargain madelast July (Appendix &apos;Gr of the Report of the Round Table Conference).It will be a long :ime before their contribution can be sufficientlystepped up, by taxation or other means, to bridge the gap between mr. Mintoffs estimates of expenditure and revenue.(2)   To concede ground to Mr. Mintoff on this issue will convincehim finally that Her Majesty&apos;s Government is ready to meet all histerms for the sj.ke of integration.    We shall thus be compelled to accept this other unfulfilled demands in connection with the drafting of the newConstitution, e.g. his demands for a constitutional guarantee ofequivalence and for a change before the next Maltese elections in thelocal electoral system.(3)   I think it is not unfair to say that the main attraction to us of integration, on the terms proposed by the Round Table Conference,was that it would provide the essential basis of co-operation between us and the Maltese Government and thus avoid the endless frictions andfrustrations of our past dealings with Maltese affairs.    I have becomeconvinced&apos;in these negotiations that Mr. Mintoff is either unwilling tomake or incapable of making his contribution to that co-operativeendeavour.    He shows no inclination to compromise on any issue;  andwithout a spirit of compromise, no scheme of closer association can hope to survive.    Thus if we show a readiness to give way each time he demands more than we are ready to concede, not only shall we havea scheme of integration very different in content from the one which parliament approved last March but the prospects of making it workwill be seriously prejudiced.(4)   In a previous assessment last week, the Governor had doubted whether Mr. Mintoff would resign on this issue and expressed confidence4- Not attached
that the security forces available would be able to deal with the situation.In his latest message, the Governor draws attention to the difficult andpossibly serious consequences of Mr. Mintoff carrying out his threat of asking for a dissolution.    The political difficulties would no doubt be serious but not, I consider, insuperable.    An unknown factor atthe moment is the attitude of the Archbishop of Malta, who is evenmore opposed to Mr. Mintoff1 s political aspirations than to integration.I consider it is not unlikely that he will urge moderation and restraint onthe Maltese people with considerable effect.    In any case, it seems unlikely that there will be any general disorder or bloodshed.7.     Having carefully weighed up the situation with which we are nowfaced, my conclusion is that we must stand by the decision to limitour financial aid this year to a maximum of  5 millions and face theconsequences.G.     I ask for your authority to take the action proposed inparagraphs I and 2 of this minute, copies of which I am sending to theLord Chancellor, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Foreign secretary and the Minister of Defence.    The Lord Chancellor (as Chairman of the round Table Conference on Malta) is fully behind this proposal of mine.(Signed) ALAN LENNOX -BOYD27th June, 1956.DRAFT ORAL statement as the statement made by the Maltese Prime Minister to the maltese Legislative Assembly on 25th June, of which I have placed acopy in the Library, covers much ground and deals with a number ofcontroversial issues, I consider it would be desirable for me to makea full statement of Her M:ajesty&apos;s Governments position.    As it is rather long, I am with permission circulating it in the Official Report.The salient points in this statement are as follows.2.     Her Majesty&apos;s Governments attitude has been based all alongon the recommendations of the Malta Round Table Conference, particularlyparagraphs 58-61 of the Report.   I would recall what I said in the debatelast March on the specific question of United Kingdom financial aid:-&quot;Further, on this financial aspect, we acceptthe proposals of the Report regarding economic assistance including the need for a clear understanding&apos;at the startr about the maximum amount of annualassistance by Her Majesty&apos;s Government over a numberof years.    Thus, acceptance of integration would not involve Her Majesty&apos;s Government in any obligationto provide financial assistance in excess of the levelsenvisaged in the Report&quot;.This statement was not challenged at that time by the maltese government or by this House.
3.     When, in accordance with the Conference^ recommendations,Her Majesty*s Government proposed that discussions should take place at the end of May or early in June on the financial arrangements forthe next few years, the Maltese Government asked instead that thediscussions should be restricted to the amount of assistance requiredin the current financial year and to the principles to be adopted afterintegration came about.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government accepted thisproposal but in the course of subsequent discussions it became manifestthat serious differences of principle existed between the two sides onthe whole question of financial aid.4.     Briefly, the Maltese Government rejected Her Majesty&apos;governments endorsement of the recommendations in paragraphs 58-61of the Report and requested that their Budget for 1956/57 should beconsidered on its merits.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government took the viewthat the merits included the revenue side as well as expenditure and pointed out that the Maltese Government proposed very large increases in expenditure on new services, both capital works and social services,which would involve continuing and increasing commitments in future years,   .  The Maltese Government, on the other hand, resisted allsuggestions that they should, themselves find new sources of revenue,either by taxation or from loans.    Thus, while expenditure was to riseby  4^ millions or nearly 45 per cent, over last year, Maltese revenuewas to rise by only  ^ million or about 3 per cent over last year.    her majesty&apos;s Government were thus being asked to meet practically thewhole of the increased deficit and thus to increase their contribution from  4^- millions last year to over  8 millions or by nearly 90 per cent.5.     Her Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to consider granting thisyear total assistance at the level of  4-5 millions recommended by theConference &quot;for the next few years&quot;.    However, the Maltese Government,having at first maintained that they could not modify their proposals inany way, were at the end of the talks prepared to consider a reduction of less than  4- million expenditure, with no increase in domestic revenue,leaving Her Majesty&apos;s Governments commitment at  7i millions.Moreover, in the course of my discussion with him, Mr. Mintoff made it clear that his Government were firmly committed to the principle of&quot;economic equivalence&quot; and intended to press for inclusion of this principle in the new Constitution.6.     The detailed arguments on either side are dealt with in the full statement which I am circulating.    There is one point, however, to whichI should like to call the attention of the House now.    The Maltese Govern-ment maintained that any serious modification in their proposals wouldbe unacceptable and that aid at the level of  5 millions would result in serious unemployment.    In my talks with the Maltese Prime Minister,I indicated that there was in my view considerable room for devisinga proper balance between schemes intended primarily to maintainemployment and schemes of economic development.    I also made itclear to him that, bearing in.mind the continuing and increasing burdenof new recurrent services and capital works in future years, it was essential for his Government to face up to the obligation which theyassumed in the agreed statement of last July, and on which the RoundTable Conference laid special emphasis, that the Maltese Governmentand people should make the best possible contribution from their own resources.7. The discussions between the Maltese Prime Minister and myself and subsequently with my Rt. Hon. Friend, the Prime Minister, did not however, find any common ground, and although conducted in a spirit ofgood-will and mutual consideration on both sides, ended inconclusively.
0.     The Maltese Prime Minister left London on 23rd June(wi-fehoutgiying any indication ^f this intentions].    He has now made a statement in Malta on 25th June which attempts to place on this House theobligation of deciding before the end of this week to accept a commitment to vote funds in due course for total assistance in the current financialyear of  7 millions.    Although I am fully aware of the seriousimplications of this matter, I cannot in all the circumstances recomm-end to this House that it should accede to this demand, and I am soinforming the Governor.
INWARD  telegram to THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIESPROM MALTA (Major Gen,, Sir R. Laycook)SimplexD. 26th June9 1956.R. 26th     &quot; &quot; 18,30 hps.EMERGENCYSECRETNo. 253My telegram No0 252.Mintoff&apos;s statement amounts to (grp0 omitted)and ultimatum, and I should be glad to know as soon aspossible whether you propose to consider meeting him inany way.    Indications here are that failing some concession,he&apos; will bring down not merely present administrations, butalso attempt to render constitutional government impossible,.In this he is not fully supported by his colleagues orthe Labour movement, but has provided against last minutedefection by obtaining written resignation for use when necessary.   While he might be persuaded to accept less than 6  million sterling, you should certainly not count onhis giving way if you stand fast.   I am sorry I cannot helpvery much towards your decision, which must depend on theimportance H.M.G. attaches to integration programme, andall repercussions of its abandonment purely on financial grounds.   You will no doubt also bear in mind that, however much those with inside knowledge know what we have had toput up with, and extent of Mintoff&apos;s misrepresentationof H.M.G.&apos;s attitude, it will almost certainly not bepossible to prevent widespread acceptance of view that.M.G. are spoiling the ship for a ha&apos;p&apos;orth of tar.This will certainly be general in Malta, as it correspondswith ineradicable local belief that base is worth muchmore to H.M.G. than is in fact granted?   Bulleting leaderto-day draws attention to impending demand for more moneyby Libya and this concept is continually being fed intothe public mind here, and will doubtless be used as additionalargument for resistance to H.M.G. &apos;s attitude,,   If no solution is reached and Mintoff will not even put throughextension to Treasury and Audit Act to maintain current supplyfollowing will be situation.on July 1st.   On Prime Minister&apos;advice Parliament will have been dissolved:   if threatdescribed in my telegram No, 250 is carried out all 23 labour members will have resigned:    and there will be no financial provision to carry on administration,,   If Mintoff refusesto run &quot;caretaker5 government during election campaignI shall have to ask Borg Olivier.,   Only circumstances inwhich he might accept would be if sufficient funds tocontinue extraordinary works on present basis were madeavailable so that no discharges were necessary.   Given this he might accept on the calculation that he would be ableto say he had stepped in to maintain employment and also because conduct of government during election period might give him some advantage,,   Even so with assembly dissolvedcontinuance of financial provision would have to be foundunder Section 59./If,
If, however, no 1 caretaker&apos; Government available9I should still have to provide funds under Section 59 forcontinuance of employment on present levels during electionperiod and in addition for carrying on administration,,Amendment of Royal Instructions might be necessary toenable me to proceed without an Executive Council. QConsiderable difficulties of M.I.G. carrying on for atleast eight weeks without Ministers and during Mintoffsall-out efforts to whip up local feeling need no emphasis.In event of general election, Mintoff will eampaiglon self-determination and rent of at least  7 million ster-ljj(corrupt gp. ?for) base.   This is so similar to nationalistprogramme that he might not win, though I think odds are on him rather than on Borg Olivier.   In either case we shouldhave a Government with which we know we cannot workharmoniously.   P.CP. might increase support on a small scale and possibility of Nationalist-P.CP. coalitioncannot be ruled out,, but I regard it as unlikely and itwould not help.In shorty consequences of forcing Mintoff onwould be unmitigated disaster from local point of view..  As regards Bill for extraordinary works provision on basis of Mintpff&apos;s statement, if and when requesting meto send message to Assembly, Mintoff asks whether H.M.G,agrees, I shall if I have no previous instructions actconstitutionally making it clear that I can in no way commitH.M.G. to any level of financial aid (corrupt gp.) ofwhich is responsibility of Maltese Government.Copies sent to;-P.S. to Prime MinisterP.S. to Lord ChancellorP.S. to Financial Secretary, Treasury.

I approached subject from angle that H.M.G*might find it a great deal easier to compromise ifconcrete evidence could be produced of effort by Malteseside to find more funds, not necessarily large amounts,but in token of willingness to play their part.Possibility of increases in taxation or floating loanwere discussed, no doubt on lines already familiar inLondon,,2*     Lengthy discussion produced following possiblecompromise which Mintoff personally accepted and agreedto recommend to his colleagues;-I would sign financial message to Assembly andassent to Bill providing for extraordinary works and special services on basis that H.M.G. would thereby commit themselves to find their share of the 620,000 odd specified in the schedule (figure isarrived at as in Mintoff&apos;s statement on assumption of aid at level of  6-g- million to  7 millioncovering provision up to the 30th (? September)*My assent would imply no commitment.of any kind asregards H.M.G.&apos; s abandonment of  5 million ceilingor acceptance of Mintoff&apos;s proposed higher ceilingfigure or provision for remainder of financialyear-,.     It would be agreed on both sides that this action is taken simply to provide further threemonths for discussion of whole question of H.M.G*&apos; financial aid to Malta, including possibility oflocal increase in taxation, loans, closer controlof expenditure by Maltese Government and, indeed.,any matter from either side relevant to thefinancial problem,.3* ,   I realise that this is effectively going backon your stand or principle as regards  5 million ceilingand that Mintoff gains three months continued expenditure at the higher rate,.     Lotting at matter from widest ,pointW^M    \     /of .: &apos;
of view however, I regard this settlement as worth it if-only for purpose of providing time for further full studjrof what is at stake.4* Briefly my assessment of decision facing you is ithis. Present financial decision is really only one aspejof much bigger decision whether or not we should break with!Mintoff and throw Integration overboard,, There are four possible choices; j(i)   So ahead with Integration and continue to live with Mintoff at cost of higherfinancial aid than is justified (you can    [call this paying blackmail if you like but Iit in effect is the price of a more or less!peaceful Malta)0(ii)   After break with Mintoff he returns to power!on a Libyan programme.(iii)   Nationalists return to power on similarprogramme either on their own or incoalition,,(iv)   Suspension of constitution and return toColonial Government-(ii) and (iii) would be more unworkable than (i) and wouldgive rise to same financial problem, but in circumstances iiwhich settlement would probably cost more, (iv) would almosicertainly cost as much to keep the people quiet and couldnot be held for any length of time*5.     In my view (i) has least disadvantages from.M.G. &apos;s point of view and is best solution in interests of malta and the Maltese*6C     3Da reaching your decision you will wish to add tothis assessment your analysis of the relevant factorsoutside Malta,,     I hope that assessment telegram we have senhas not given false impression of probabilities here and Ishould like to emphasise that if you decide against Mintoffand Integration, we can cope with resulting situation^  Butsurely such an Important decision should be taken at leisureand not between now and Saturday with the pistol at ourheads0     Hence my recommendation above* jCopies sent tos-PoSo to Prime Minister.,PaSo to Foreign Secretary,P.S. to Minister of Defence. fP.S. to Financial Secretary, Treasury.P.S. to Lord Chancellor,,PsS. to Chancellor of the Exchequer^
