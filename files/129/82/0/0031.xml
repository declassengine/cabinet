Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1956SECRET CopyNOjCP. (56) 18118th July, 1956, CABINETLONG-TERM ASSURANCES FOR FARMERSNote by the Chancellor of the ExchequerAlthough the report of the Ministerial Committee on the Farm Price Review(CP. (56) 177) fairly represents what we agreed in our talks, I now feel that weshould not commit ourselves at this moment to assurances to the farmers of a kind which give us too little room for manoeuvre. We are having to keep threeballs in the air at the moment our talks with the Australians, the new initiative in Europe, and assurances for farmers and this needs careful co-ordination ifwe are not to drop one of them. I would much prefer not to go any furthernow with the farmers than is absolutely essential, so that we may have more time to see what is likely to happen to our trade with Europe and with theCommonwealth.2. I agree that we should offer a new long-term capital improvements schemeto the farmers. Such a scheme would be useful whatever agricultural policy wefinally adopted, for capital improvements mean genuine increase in wealth. I amalso prepared that we should discuss with the farmers a new guarantee about theminimum prices of commodities. The idea is that we could give them an assurance that the guaranteed price for any particular commodity would not be reducedby more than a certain percentage in any year. I am, however, anxious that weshould keep the wheat situation open, because it is in terms of wheat that we shall probably have to pay the price to Australia not only for an agreement onpreferences, but also for any European initiative that we may take. With regardto the overall guarantee and the two methods of giving long-term security, i.e., thenet income or the recoupment of costs system, I hope that it will be possible for officials to keep the talks going in general terms until the holidays intervene. i feel that the Cabinet ought to be in a position by the middle of September to reachbroad conclusions upon the whole policy, and we should not go so far with the farmers this side of the holidays as to prejudice our final decision.H. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,17th July, 1956.50199
