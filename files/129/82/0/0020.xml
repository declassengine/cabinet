Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1956Copy No.   2 8CABINETSALARIES OF THE LOWER judiciary memorandum by the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of Statefor scotland we have for some time been under strong and increasing pressure from certainclasses of the lower judiciary in England and Wales and in Scotland for an increasein their salaries. The classes in question so far as England and Wales areconcerned are the Official Referees of the Supreme Court, the County court judges, the Metropolitan Magistrates, and the Masters and Registrars of theSupreme Court, and so far as Scotland is concerned, the two full-time Sheriffs,the Chairman of the Land Court and the Sheriffs Substitute. The salaries of theCounty Court Judges and the Metropolitan Magistrates are fixed by statute andany alteration in them would accordingly require legislation; the salaries of theother classes concerned can be increased without legislation.2. By the Judicial Offices (Salaries, &amp;c.) Act, 1952, the salaries of the county court Judges were fixed at  2,800 a year, and those of the metropolitan magistrates at  2,500 a year. The salaries of the Official Referees (who are in effectAssistant Judges of the High Court) are at present the same as those of the county court Judges. The Masters and Registrars of the Supreme Court are on a salaryscale, the present maximum of which is  2,700 a year. The salaries of the full-timeSheriffs, the Chairman of the Land Court and the Sheriffs Substitute vary considerably: the highest paid is the Sheriff of Lanarkshire with a salary of 2,900 a year, while the Sheriffs Substitute are divided into three Groups, ranging from  2,400 for those in Group A (who sit in Glasgow) to  1,900 a year for thosein Group C. These salaries were fixed at the same time as those of the county court Judges and the Metropolitan Magistrates.3. The increases in salary given in 1952 resulted from negotiations conducted by the Socialist Government and announced by them in Parliament in July, 1951.The increases were widely regarded as inadequate and, particularly in the case ofthe County Court Judges and the Sheriffs, as an unsatisfactory compromise. Since1952 frequent reference has been made in Parliament to the under-payment of theCounty Court Judges and the other judicial officers with whom we are concerned.Formal representations for increases in salary were made to the Lord Chancellorby the County Court Judges in February, 1955, and by the metropolitan magistrates in March, 1955; the Masters had already requested an increase inOctober, 1954. Similar representations were made to the Secretary of State onbehalf of the full-time Sheriffs, the Chairman of the Land Court and the SheriffsSubstitute in October, 1954; in their case dissatisfaction with existing salaries isaccentuated by the fact that the Sheriffs Substitute, who exercise a jurisdictioncomparable to, but in some respects wider than, that of the County Court Judges,have for long claimed parity of salary with the latter.4. Each of us was satisfied, after careful consideration of the claims madeon behalf of the various classes, that the case for substantial increases had beenmade out, and we approached the Chancellor of the Exchequer with our proposals in the spring of 1955. As, however, at that time the views of the Royal Commissionon the Civil Service in regard to increases in Civil Service salaries were not known,50161SECRETCP. (56) 17011th July, 1956
it was not possible for us to put forward any definite proposals for the increasesthat we regarded as appropriate. Pending the Report of the Royal Commission,the claim that the Sheriffs Substitute or at least the eight in Group A who sit in glasgow should have parity of salary with the County Court Judges was examined on behalf of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and ourselves by officials,who were instructed to review the salary relationships generally between thedifferent judicial categories concerned. No agreement was reached on the claim for parity. Our representatives were satisfied that the claim was established forthe Glasgow Sheriffs Substitute, but the Treasury representative was unableto agree.5. After the Royal Commission had reported, we informed the Chancellorof the Exchequer of the salaries that we regarded as appropriate in the light of theCommission^ recommendations. So far as the figures are concerned, agreement has now been reached except in the case of the Metropolitan Magistrates and theSheriffs and Sheriffs Substitute. We have been unable to reach agreement withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer as to the time at which the increases should begranted and we are therefore reluctantly compelled to bring the matter beforethe Cabinet.6. The Annex to this memorandum sets out our reasons for pressing for a salary of  3,500 a year for the Metropolitan Magistrates and the Sheriffs Substitutein Glasgow instead of the  3,250 which the Chancellor of the Exchequer is preparedto concede.7. Apart from the figures on which we have been unable to reach agreementwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, there remains the question of timing. TheChancellor of the Exchequer has informed us that, in view of the urgent need toavoid further increases in salaries and wages at the present time, he regards it as important that no alteration should be made in the salaries of the lower judiciarybefore the spring of next year and that in the meantime Ministers should not makeany statement to those concerned in regard to the Governments intentions. We do not think this is practicable. As we have already pointed out, the claims for anincrease in respect of each of the classes of the judiciary for whom we areresponsible were made before the Royal Commission on the Civil Service reported and that substantial increases are long overdue is in our view incontrovertible.There is very strong feeling on the part of all those concerned that they arebeing hardly dealt with and it has now become impossible to find candidatesof anything like the right quality for the important post of Sheriff Substitute in glasgow. If the Government had decided against any increases in Civil Servicesalaries at this time on the ground of the necessity for general restraint, it is nodoubt true that the Judges would have been prepared, albeit reluctantly, to recognise the need for further delay in meeting their own claims. But in view of the decisionsalready announced in regard to salaries in the Civil Service, we have no doubt at all that it is impracticable for us to refrain for much longer from giving some indication of the Governments intentions. The need for this is underlined bythe fact that&apos; the Chancellor of the Exchequer has agreed that the salaries ofmembers of the Lands Tribunal in England should be raised to the figure of 3,750 agreed upon for the County Court Judges and it has only proved possibleto recruit the new surveyor members of the Tribunal, who are urgently needed,by informing them of the proposed increase in salary.8. It has been suggested that the Judges could be told that the Governmenthave agreed to increase their salaries but that, for the reasons adduced by theChancellor of the Exchequer, the increases cannot be given until the early part of1957. We reject this suggestion, because in the first place it will certainly not satisfy the Judges, who were told that they must await the Governmenfs decision inregard to the Royal Commission^ proposals for the Civil Service and who willnot be convinced by arguments for further delay now that those proposals havebeen implemented. Moreover such a course would be indefensible in Parliament,where the Government would be unable to explain the differentiation in treatment between the Civil Service and the judiciary.9.   As we have explained in paragraph 1, legislation is needed to alter the salaries of the County Court Judges and the Metropolitan Magistrates, but all the      other salaries can be increased without legislation. In England these latter salarieshave in the past been raised at the same time as those of Civil Servants of
-Ipcomparable grades, which are now being increased retrospectively from 1st April,1956. In these circumstances we do not see how the Government can in justiceavoid making an early announcement of the agreed increases in the salaries ofthe Official Referees and the Masters and Registrars. We have already mentionedin paragraph 7 the practical necessity for increasing the salaries of the SheriffsSubstitute with the least possible delay. We think that an announcement madenow will rightly be linked in the public estimation with the increase, in Civil Servicesalaries, whereas if it is delayed until next year it will be regarded as a yieldingto yet another round of salary claims, with results which would be much moreembarrassing to the Government. We therefore press very strongly for anannouncement before the Recess and for the introduction of the necessary legislation in regard to the County Court Judges and the Metropolitan Magistratesearly next Session. The increases made in 1952 operated with retrospective effect from the date of the announcement and we think that the same course ought to befollowed on this occasion.10.  We therefore ask for the agreement of the Cabinet to (1) an increase in the salaries of the Metropolitan Magistrates to  3,500;(2) an increase in the salaries of the Sheriffs Substitute in Glasgow to  3,500,with the related salaries for the full-time Sheriffs, the Chairman of theLand Court and the other Sheriffs Substitute which are set out in the table in paragraph 2 of the Annex;(3) an announcement of the Government^ proposals before the Recess andthe introduction of the necessary legislation early next Session, the increases in salary to operate retrospectively from the date of theannouncement.K.J. S.9th July, 1956.ANNEXMetropolitan MagistratesThe present salary of a Metropolitan Magistrate is  2,500, fixed in 1952when the County Court Judges, whose salary had previously been the same as theMetropolitan Magistrates&apos;, were given  2,800. (The extra  300 was intended, torecompense the County Court Judges for sitting as Special Divorce Commissioners,for which they had hitherto been paid by fees, and represented the average of suchfees.) The Lord Chancellor has now agreed with the Chancellor of the exchequer on a salary of  3,750 for the County Court Judges, and he considers that theMetropolitan Magistrates should receive  3,500. The Chancellor of the exchequer is unwilling to go beyond  3,250 on the grounds that this is the salary which willin future be payable to Under-Secretaries in the Civil Service, whose salaries are on the same level as those of the Metropolitan Magistrates, and that the rise of 1,000 a year on a salary of  2,500 is in itself too much. In the Lord Chancellorsview, however, it is wrong to equate Metropolitan Magistrates and Under-Secretaries, whose salaries have been on the same level only since the war. If regardis had to the pre-war salaries of the Metropolitan Magistrates and those of senior civil Servants, the former would, if their salaries are fixed at  3,250, be substantially less well-treated than the Civil Servants; it is clear mathematically that, to restore the relative position of the Metropolitan Magistrates, they should have a salary justshort of  3,500. Moreover, it is important to take account of the fact that the salaries of the Metropolitan Magistrates are fixed by statute and are therefore bound(as they do at present) to lag behind the salaries of Civil Servants of comparablegrades; it has now been agreed that the salaries of senior Civil Servants should bekept under review by an advisory committee, but it cannot be expected, and itwould in any event be undesirable, that statutory salaries should be altered at suchfrequent intervals as an arrangement of this nature implies. The Lord Chancelloris satisfied that the work of the Metropolitan Magistrates is of great importance

The Lord Chancelloris satisfied that the work of the Metropolitan Magistrates is of great importance
and is performed to an exceptional degree in the public eye and that the salary mustbe such as to attract candidates of the right calibre. For this purpose he considersthat a substantial increase is now required.Sheriffs and Sheriffs Substitute2. The differences between the Secretary of State and the Chancellor of theExchequer appear from the following table:  		Proposed	by	Proposed by		Secretary	of	Chancellor of	Present r	State  		the Exchequer  Sheriff of Lanarkshire     ......	Z 2,900	Z 4,000		3,750Sheriff of Lothians and Peebles ...	2,700	3,750		3,500Chairman, Land Court   ......	2,700	3,750		3,500Sheriff Substitute, Group A	2,400	3,500		3,250Group B	2,200	3,000		2,750Group C	1,900	2,500		2,250It is true that the increases proposed by the Secretary of State are greater thanthose that could be strictly justified on the basis of the recommendations made bythe Royal Commission for comparable Civil Service salaries. But in consideringthe figures it is essential to bear in mind the long-standing claim for parity betweenthe Sheriffs Substitute and the County Court Judges in England and Wales, whichthe Secretary of State is satisfied is justified on the merits in the case of the SheriffsSubstitute in Glasgow. The only reason why the Secretary of State is prepared toaccept  3,500 for these Sheriffs Substitute at a time when the Chancellor of theExchequer has agreed to  3,750 for the County Court Judges is because the latteramount is greater than the pensionable emoluments of all but two of the Judges ofthe Court of Session. For pension purposes the latter are treated as having a salary of  3,600 although their total salary is  6,600; and they would be critical of anarrangement under which their pensions were less than those of some of theSheriffs Substitute.
