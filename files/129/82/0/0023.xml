THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government secret. P. (56) 173Uth July, 1956COPY NO,o56CABINETTHE POLICE, FIRE AND PROBATION services memorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department and Minister for Welsh AffairsThe question of the restrospective application of pay increases for the police, fire and probation services was considered by Ministers,under the Chairmanship of the Lord Privy Seal, at a meeting held on19th June (GEN. 533/lst Meeting).    I was then invited to arrange for officials to consider how best the Government could, if they should sodecide, take statutory powers to make an award of poUce payretrospective, while at the same time eliminating or reducing the consequential effects of such a step on the pay of teachers and on national insurance beneficiaries.    I circulate for the information of the Cabinetthe report which has been submitted to me.G. L1L1. -G,Home Office, S.W.1.11th July, 1956.
Legislation to allow retrospective effect tobe given to increases in the pay of the police,fire and probation servicesReport by meetins of officials.     In accordance with conclusion (3) of themeeting of Ministers held on 19th June, 1956(Gen.533/lst Meeting) officials representing theHome Office, the Scottish Home Department, theMinistry of Education, the Scottish education department, the Ministry of Pensions and national insurance and the Treasury have met tc consider how best the Government could, if they should so decide,take statutory powers to make an award of police payretrospective, while at the same time eliminating orreducing the consequential effects of such a step onthe pay of teachers and on National Insurancebeneficiaries.2,     It has been assumed that any such legislation would also apply to the fire and probation services,since, as the Home Secretary pointed out in his minute to the Prime Minister of 14th June (a copyof which was annexed to GEN.533/1), the legal positionis the same in regard to those services, which arealso within the sphere of responsibility of theHome Departments, and there are no grounds on whicha distinction between the three services could bejustified.fetio-nal. laasurgjica. :a,iicl,othea;-3flciel benefits3,     The rates of family allowances and national Insurance benefits are fixed by statute,.tocome into force on an appointed day, which is usually acme months, after the Act comes into force.Increases in war pensions are made by Royal Warrant./Legislation
Legislation which specifically permitted retrospectionin police pay awards cculd obviously be used politicallyto support criticism of any apparent delay in giving effect to announced increases in such payments.     Suchcriticism could be mot, however, because it is thepractice to fix dates of operation for such increasesas early as is administratively practicable.     TheGovernment is frequently pressed to bring the new ratesinto force forthwith, but this is consistently resistedon the ground that it is impracticable, since time isrequired to issue the necessary instruments tobeneficiaries and retrospective payment would involveadjustments, e.g. in relation to assistance payments,which are not feasible.     The validity of this argument,which applies a fortiori to any suggestions that increases should be given effect from a date earlier than the amending legislation or Royal Warrant, wouldnot be affected by legislation allowing increases inpolice pay to be retrospective.     There is after all a clear distinction between pay on the one hand and pensionsand insurance benefits on the other.     For one thing, thelatter are related to contributions, which cannot beincreased retrospectively.     For another, locking at thecountry as a whole, the possibility of retrospection isthe rule rather than the exception in the case of pay:it is unknown in the case of pensions and insurance benefits.     In short, we are satisfied that if theproposed change is made, no matter by what moans, theGovernment&apos;s hand will be in no way weakened in resistingretrospection for increases in pensions and national insurance benefits,A.
4.     The rates of national assistance payments are fixed by regulations proposed by the national assistance Board and made after approval in draft by benHouses of Parliament.     Since payments are made to mee .:current needs, and officers of the Board have discretion, in case of need, to make payment inexcess of the standard rates, there can be no justification for back-dating increases, and thereshould be no difficulty in maintaining this principle,:Teachers&apos; pay.     The proposed legislation would give rise to much greater difficulty in relation to teachers&apos; pay.In England and Wales the pay scales of teachers are fixed by an Order made under section 89 of theEducation Act, 1944o     The Minister has no power tomake such an Order with retrospective effect.Hitherto the Burnham Committee have made theiragreements for periods of three years and theCommittee have negotiated revised scales sufficiently long before the end of that period to enable the     minister to make a new Order to come into force immediately on its expiration.     This triennial reviewarrangement may not continue, however;   therecommendation submitted by the Burnham Committeewhich comes into force on 1st October next will not,like the previous recommendation, specify any periodof operation.6.     The position in Scotland is substantially thesame, except that, before making regulations giving effect to any recommendations of the National joint council the Secretary of State must lay them beforeParliament in draft for 40 days, and this has/occasionally
occasionally resulted in increases coming into force inScotland two or three months later than corresponding increases in England and Wales,     Nevertheless, boththe teachers and the education authorities are anxiousto preserve the system of publication in draft.   Itwould, however, be useful to have power to make the salary awards retrospective to the date on which theNational Joint Council make their recommendations,7.    A particular complication in Scotland is thatthe Secretary of State is responsible for bothteachers&apos; and police pay.     Accordingly, if powers were taken to permit retrospection in police payawards it would be extremely difficult in scotland to deny similar treatment to teachers.The formjgf ^Legislation relating to policc^firgand probation services.     If it were decided to take statutory powersto back-date awards of pay to these services, this could be done in one of two ways:-(a) by amending the law to allow statutory instruments proscribing pay scales tobe made with retrospective effect;   or(b) by amending the law so that the payscales of these services, although stilldetermined by the Secretary of State,would no longer be prescribed by statutory instruments,9.     The Ministry of Education and the scottish education Department would prefer the latter method.The National Union of Teachers have not hithertoasked for retrospection, partly because the systemof triennial review has made&quot; it unnecessary but also/partly
partly because they regard the fixing of pay scalesby statutory instrument as a valuable safeguard andhave assumed that they could not have retrospectionexcept at the price of giving up this safeguard.     Ifthe law were amended to allow statutory instrumentsprescribing the pay of the police, fire and probationservices to be made with retrospective effect.therecan be little doubt that the teachers would soon be led to ask for asimilar concession.     If, however, the pay of these services ceased to be prescribed by statutory instrument, no precedent would beestablished on which the teachers could base a demand that power should be taken to back-date Orders undersection 89 of the Education Act, 1944, or regulations under section 79 of the Education (ScotlandAct, 1946.     The Ministry of Pensions and national insurance would support - this view, in so far as theyhave an interest.10.   The Home Office and the Scottish Home Department,on the other hand, consider that the removal of payscales from the scope of statutory instruments is undesirable in principle and would also involve seriously...practical difficulties.     It would be necessary tosecure the agreement of the Police Federations, who,like the National Union of Teachers, have in the pastregarded the ficing of pay by statutory regulations as&apos;a valuable safeguard.    Moreover, there would be a danger that legislation in this form woiild enoouragerenewed demands by the local authorities for the abrogation of any control by the Secretaries of Stateover rates of pay and conditions of service in thethree services concerned.     The drafting of thelegislation would be much more complicated and, if it/were
were asked why the Government had not adopted the simplecourse of method (a), it would be difficult to giveconvincing reasons.     In any case, it appears to theHome Departments to he very doubtful whether, if thesubstance of retrospection is conceded to the police,fire and probation services, the adoption of method(b) in preference to method (a) would more effectivelydeter the teachers from asking for the sameconcession, except perhaps in the short terra.   Itwould be necessary to provide expressly that anincrease of pay might take effect from a date priorto the determination of the Secretary of State, andit would be clear on the face of the Bill that paymentof the scales determined by the Secretary of state would be mandatory on local authorities.     It wouldbe apparent that the new procedure could be readilyadapted to apply to scales recommended by the burnham committee or the Scottish National Joint Counciland approved by the appropriate Minister, and itmight be expected that the teachers would then wishto enjoy the benefits of similar legislation.Conclusion11.   It seems clear that the choice of method shouldmake no difference as respects National insurance benefits and pensions and National Assistanceallowances.     In these fields the Governmentcould continue to resist the introduction of retrospection whichever method is chosen.12.   The main difficulty will arise over teachers&apos;pay.     It is clear that there is no method ofgiving the possibility of retrospection to the/police
police which would eliminate the risk of pressure on the Government to give the same possibility tothe teachers.     The adoption of method (b) inparagraph /&quot;8J7 above would offer the better hopeof reducing that risk, but the Home departments are opposed to it both in principle and onpractical grounds, and it seems to them likely that its advantages would be marginal andtransitory,,13.   Ministers have indicated that they would be strongly opposed to making the new pay scales for teachers operative from a date earlier than October, 1956.     The safest course, for thispuipose, would be to postpone any legislationuntil after 1st October and to exclude from its scope any orders or regulations made before royal assent.    This precaution would perhaps be more necessary if method (a) is chosen than if method (b)is chosen.14.   The appendix to this report shows alternativedraft heads of a Bill, according to which method ischosen.
APP3MDIXMethod (a)Heads of a Bill to enable sny statutory instrumentprescribing increased pay or allowances inthe police, fire and probation services to be made with retrospective effectGeneralFor the purposes of the Bill the relevant services would be thepolice, fire and probation services, and the relevant enactments would bethe enactments enabling the Secretary of State to make a statutory instrument as to the pay and allowances of those services.Alternative A1.     The Bill would provide that a statutory instrument under any of the relevant enactments could, in so far as it gave effect to a recommendationof the appropriate negotiating body or an arbitration award providing for increases in pay or allowances, be made so as to take effect from a datebefore the making of the statutory instrument not being earlier than thedate, if any, specified in the recommendation or award.2.    The &quot;appropriate negotiating body&quot; for the purposes of the Bill inrelation to a relevant service would be defined as a negotiating bodyconstituted for that service in accordance with arrangements approved bythe Secretary of State.Alternative BThe Bill would simply provide that the power under any of the relevant enactments to make a statutory instrument as to pay or allowances should be excrcisable, except by way of reduction, as respects any period before the making of the statutory instrument.
Heads of a Bill to remove necessity for prescribingscales of pay for police, fire and probationservices by statutory instrument1, The relevant services for the purposes of the Bill would be the police,fire and probation services.2.     The Bill would provide that the scales of pay of members of a relevantservice should be such as might be determined by the Secretary of State ,and that where such a determination provided for an increase in pay itmight be made so as to take effect from such date prior to the date ofthe determination as the S scretary of State might specify,3.     The reference to pay would be deleted from the existing statutory provisions conferring power on the Secretary of State to make a statutory instrument as to the pay, allowances, conditions of service, etc of arelevant service, but the Bill would make provision whereby any part ofthose statutory provisions which provides for consultation vrith or theconsideration of recommendations made by, any negotiating or otherrepresentative body (e.g. Fire Services Act, 1947, section 17(2), (3), (4))would continue to have effect, with the necessary modifications, inrelation to the making by the Secretary of State of a determination as topay as it has effect at present in relation to the making by the Secretaryof State of a statutory instrument as to pay.
