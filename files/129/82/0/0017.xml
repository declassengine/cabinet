Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1956SECRET Copy No.CP. (56) 1676th July, 1956CABINETRURAL  wales memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister for Welsh Affairs and the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and food we attach the draft of a White Paper on Rural Wales.2. In July 1953 a Report by the Rural Development Panel of the council for Wales and Monmouthshire was published (Cmd. 8844) drawing attention tothe steady loss of population in rural Wales and pointing out that agriculture,the main industry in the upland areas, was economically vulnerable. The Reportproposed the establishment of a Development Corporation with the object offurther subsidising the existing economy from Government funds. In the white paper on Rural Wales published in November 1953 (Cmd. 9014), the Governmentrejected the idea of a Development Corporation, but agreed that action was needed to help the rural areas of Wales to achieve a more stable economy and greaterprosperity. They announced that, as one of the first steps to this end, the WelshAgricultural Land Sub-Commission would be asked to advise on the best useof land in a specimen Welsh upland area.3. The Sub-Commission&apos;s Report was published in December 1955(Cmd. 9631). Its recommendations can be briefly summarised under four main headings, namely:(i) Agriculture: The type of farming should be mainly livestock rearing,and farms should be larger in order to become economically viable.No compulsion should be used, but farms should be encouraged toamalgamate, and the administration of agricultural subsidies should be aimed to help this natural development.(ii) Forestry: There should be more extensive afforestation of the uplandareas, and afforestation should be closely integrated with agriculture.(iii) Basic Services: Encouragement should be given to the co-ordinatedimprovement of the basic services such as housing, water supply,electricity, and roads, in order to provide a firm base for the futured development of agriculture and forestry.(iv) Co-ordination of rural development: Machinery should be set up for ensuring that the development of upland areas is guided on economiclines without waste of resources.4. This Report was referred by the Ministry of Agriculture to a numberof outside bodies in Wales, including the Council for Wales and Monmouthshire.Their views on the Report were by no means unanimous, and in particular theCouncil reaffirmed the view which had been already rejected by the Governmentthat the existing uneconomic pattern of small farms should be maintained by further financial aid applied through some special agency.5. Acceptance of the Report will thus not be altogether acceptable to Welshopinion, but the suggested qualifications should do much to reduce controversy.We well appreciate the reason behind the views of the Council which is concerned50124
with preserving the existing traditional form of society and culture in rural Wales.But this could only be done by the continuation and extension of government financial assistance which could not be defended. We agree with the Sub-Commission that if stability and prosperity is to be restored, the administrationof existing grants and subsidies and the planning of basic services . must bedirected towards a pattern of farming in accordance with present-day economic circumstances. We also agree that the upland areas can be helped by the extensionof afforestation and its close integration with agriculture.6. We invite the approval of the Committee to the presentation to parliament by the Minister of Agriculture as soon as possible of a White Paper announcingthese intentions in the form of the attached draft, subject to any minor drafting amendments which may be agreed.G. LL.-G.D. H. A.4th July, 1956.
DRAFT WHITE PAPER ON RURAL WALESIntroduction.The Government have considered the valuable report on the mid-Wales Investigation by the Welsh Agricultural Land Sub-Commission (Command 9631) in the light of the comments by the interested bodies, including those of the Council for Wales and monmouthshire.     In reaching their conclusions they have also had the benefit of the advice of the Welsh Hill Farming AdvisorySub-committee proposed and of the work which the Natural Resources(Technical) Committee has been doing over recent years on theproblems of upland areas.2.     The Government is in general agreement with the recommenda-tions in the report, and in particular that there is a need to createmore stable conditions in the remoter upland areas of Wales.They consider that prosperity, stable employment, and improvementof services in the rural areas of Wales can best be promoted bythe development of agriculture on the basis of economically viableand well-equipped farms, coupled with an extension of forestry.Agriculture3.     The Sub-Commission&apos;s analysis broadly confirms that of the rural Development Panel of the Council far Wales and Monmouth.The agricultural situation is complex, and a process of adapta-tion to changing economic conditions is taking place.k*     Many farmers are taking advantage of technical and financial help to improve their farms, and their homes.     But others, especiallyin the remoter districts, are selling their farms for afforestation-tion, for summer grazing or for amalgamation with other farms.Others on small farms on poor land are securing a modest livingby great physical effort,  by the full use of production grants,and by concentrating on liquid milk production.     In these wayssome farms are growing;    others are disappearing or will be abandoned when the present ageing occupier departs.      Thereis, too, still a substantial movement of population from the
upland areas, although this has to some extent been checked byafforestation, and the operation &amp;f Hill Farming and LivestockRearing Acts.5o     The Government fully appreciate the complexity of these developments which are of wide social significance.     They agreewith the Sub-Commission&apos;s view that action should be designed to&quot;assist the rural economy to adjust itself in the light of changingconditions so as to reach a new stability,They also agree thatthe most promising way of doing this is to help the developmentof economic and well-equipped farms based on the type of agricul-ture most suited to the greater part cf the upland areac&apos;, namely,the rearing of cattle and sheep.      This should be done withoutresorting to compulsory means,6.     A great deal has already been done under the Hill Farming and livestock Rearing Acts,     Already work amounting to  3f millionhas been grant-aided in Wales.      This financial assistance for the basic improvement of the farms, coupled with the production grants,has brought new life to many parts of upland Wales,7o    The Government are convinced that this constructive work mustgo on.     Since the Sub-Commission reported, they have announced their intention of extending until 1963 the period in which schemesfor improving livestock rearing land may be submitted and ofincreasing by  5 million the limit on grants for that purpose.In the Government&apos;S view the extension of these provisions willmeet certain of the points the Sub-Cemmission had in mind, inparticular, it will supersede their recommendation forrationalisation grants.
The Government are confident that farmers and landowners in wales will avail themselves of this further opportunity to carry outcomprehensive improvements under the Hill Farming and LivestockRearing Acts, and so put their farms on to a sounder economic footing.8.     Consideration has also been given to the recommendation aboutthe sponsoring of prefabricated, buildings.     The use of suchbuildings is likely to be limited, but the Ministry of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food is arranging for the compilation of a list of firms, making parts of such buildings, which can be used inconnection with advisory work.     The Government do not, however,consider that it would be practicable to organise a contract service for the improvement of farm roads and farm yards utilizing thetechnical services of highway authorities or private contractors, inview of the remoteness of many of the upland holdings, and the considerable burden of work already falling on highway authorities.9.     The Government agree with the Sub-Commission that the balanceof economic argument is in favour of increasing the size of many ofthe upland farms.     Amalgamation, as the Sub-Commission points out,has been going on for many years and seems likely to continue.The younger generation will not stay in the hills unless they seethe prospect of combining the hill farmer&apos;s independence with ahigher standard of living than their parents were able to attain.The Government believe that the creation of stable conditions inthe rural areas can be achieved only by encouraging the trend towardsmore stable and economic units and share the view expressed in theReport that financial assistance should help forward this inevitabledevelopment.10.     The Government consider that grants under the Hill Farming and livestock Rearing Acts have already assisted and can, if administeredon sound principles, assist still further in this process.Amalgamation is not usually based on the large farm, which inmany cases is large enough already, but on the medium-sized farm,which is, or is capable as a result of rehabilitation of becoming,an economic unit and providing the nucleus around which a
larger holding can later develop.      This is particularly the case where such a farm is in the hands of an able and energetic farmer.It is just such a farmer who is most likely to submit an improvementscheme under the Acts.11,    The Acts will therefore be administered on the following principles,,     In the first place, the land, as regards quality andsituation, must be more suitable for livestock raising than forother purposes.     This means in particular that land more suit-able for growing trees will be excluded.     Secondly, the expendi-ture of public money on rehabilitation can only be justified ifthe unit concerned is, or is likely to become as a result ofimprovement, a viable economic unit.     The Sub-Commission recem-mended that a whole-time upland farm unit should, in their view,be large enough te maintain 500 Welsh breeding ewes throughout theyear, or an equivalent number of other stock,      They regarded this as an optimum size.     No such standard can be universallyapplicable and it is inevitable that   opinion should differ as towhat is the most sui+able standard to aim at in the different parts of rural Wales.     In all the circumstances the Governmenthave decided that the most practicable method of working towardsthe objective of viable economic units is to assist farms whichyield to the occupier a net income at least equivalent to thatenjoyed by an agricultural worker.     In the Government&apos;s view the firm application of these principles will contribute oubstantiallyto the emergence of many more viable farms of the type recommendedby the Sub-Commission,12.    The Government agree with the Sub-Commission&apos;s view that therewill continue to be a place in the upland community for a number of medium and small farms which will provide an additional source of income to the part-time v/orker and preserve an entry into farmingfor the young and ambitious man with limited experience and capital.Although such farms will not be eligible for assistance under the hill Farming and Livestock Rearing Acts, they will continue to qualify in suitable cases for other Government financial assistanceto agriculture.Forestry13.    The Government agree with the conclusion set out in paragraph
12h(f) of the Report that &quot;the development of afforestation,properly integrated with agriculture, will strengthen the social and economic fabric of the countryside and assist materially inthe rehabilitation of the upland areas.&quot;1q.,    They agree with the broad classification by the Sub-Commission of the types of land in the survey area and with their view that there are large areas which are economically more suitable for forestry than for agricultural development and other areas with an uncertain agricultural future.     In these areas thereis scope for extensive planting by the Forestry Commission.Integration of Agriculture and Forestry15.    The Government endorse the view that there should be &quot;the closest co-operation between agriculture and forestry interests,which require to be co-ordinated locally, as they are cn properlymanaged estates.&quot;     The Government believe the closest integration of agriculture and forestry will be of benefit to both, and to theupland areas,     For example, trees can provide shelter and timberfor farm needs;   forestry brings new blood into an area, providesdiversity of employment, and permits the seasonal exchange oflabour with agriculture;    and the services which forestry needscan often be planned to assist both industries.,169    There is already clese consultation between the forestry commission and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foodover not only the use of agricultural land for afforestation, butalso the pattern and timing *f planting.     County AgriculturalExecutive Committees are consulted by officers of the Ministry onall major proposals for afforestation in their counties.     these arrangements for consultation will be continued.     In addition theGovernment hope that owners and occupiers in suitable localities will themselves co-operate in schemes of planting which will assist the integration of agrjcul ture and forestry.17.    The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food hasacquired a site at Pwllpeiran in Cardiganshire which it is proposedto develop, in conjunction with the Forestry Commission, as an experimental Hill Husbandry Farm.     This will enable practicalexperiments in integrating agriculture with forestry to &quot;be under taken.,
18.    The Forestry Commission fully accept the specific recom-mendations included in (i) to (viii) of paragraph 126(e) of theReport, which indeed largely represent an extension ef the commissions policy, and are taking action as follows:-(a) Pattern of PlantingWherever possible planting by the Commission will beso planned as to provide the maximum benefit to agriculture,while parts of areas acquired for forestry v/hich are more suitable for agriculture will be allocated for that purpose,particularly where the construction of forest roads willmake the land more accessible.      In addition the commission are prepared to accept quite small areas for planting.(Recommendations (ii) and (iv),)(b) FencingWhere the Commission have made plantations on hillland and   upland grazings, they will maintain fences whichthey have erected or maintained for the protection of theiryoung plantations, even when they are no longer requiredfor that purpose, so long as this is essential in theinterest of stock grazing on adjoining hill land and uplandgrazings,      These arrangements will not apply to roadsidefences or to fences in respect of .vhich an adjoining owneror tenant has a written contractual liability.     Nor do theyimply any legal liability on the Commission which would not otherwise rest on them.      But the Commission h**pe that thispolicy will be regarded as an act of good will to the hillfarming community whose neighbours they have become,(Recommendation (iii).)(c) Roads and Provisions of services the Commission will plan the   roads which they mustbuild for forestry purposes so that wherever possible theycan be of service to farms and sheep walks in the vicinity.In addition the Commission will be prepared to make avail-able to adjoining farmers, on a contract basis, equipment
and   labour for road-making, drainage, and other heavy workwhere it can he spared without detriment to the Commission&apos;sown operations,     (Recommentations (i) and (v),  )(d) Forest labour the Commission will make arrangements that, wherever possible, forest workers will be released during the summer months for work on adjoining farms, transport being provided,where available, on a repayment basis,,    (Recommenatipn (vi),  )(e) Housing of Forest workers the Commission have adopted the policy of housing forestworkers in existing villages and hamlets wherever this can bedone so as to strengthen and diversify the present communitylife,     (Recommendation (vii),  )(f) Assistance from Farming community the Commission welcome the proposal that farmers shouldbe prepared to assist the Forestry Commission by keepinghorses for casual haulage work, keeping a look-out for fires,etc,, and indeed are appreciative of the assistance which theyhave always received from their neighbours.    (Recommendation(viii)o  )Basic Services19,    The Government agree that the improvement of basic services should be planned so as to foster the creation of a more stableeconomy.     As the development and integration of agriculture and forestry leads to the growth of more active rural communities thedemand for the basic services will increase and the Government expect to see a continuing long-term development of these services.     Muchhas already been done and improvement is gontinuing.   TheGovernment is satisfied that a good deal mere can be achieved withthe aid of the present wide and considerable facilities for financial assistance.     These are reviewed briefly in thefollowing paragraphs,20.    In the rural areas of Wales the improvement of existing houses is of particular importance.     This process has already
begun and it&apos;should be possible to carry it a good deal further in the next few years, with the assistance of improvement grants under the Hill ^arming and Livestock Rearing Acts and^the housing acts,     In addition the erection of council houses is proceedingand will be continued both to replace unfit unimproveable houses and to add to the total available supply of houses, including those required for forest workers who, in some areas are likelyto represent the main demand for additional houses.     The government note the recommendation that cottages are required for retiredfarmers, but they do not think it would be justifiable to ask localauthorities to make specific provision of cottages at subsidisedlow rents for this special class of the community,     it should beremembered, however, that Section 5 of the Housing Subsidies Act, 1956provides for additional housing subsidies in areas where continuedhousebuilding by the local authority would result in an unreason-able rate burden and this provision may well be valuable in uplandrural Wales.21.   Public piped water supplies will continue to be developed.Since 1st August, 19^5, rural water supply schemes estimated to cost ever  8 million, towards which it has been agreed to pay 3.25 million of Exchequer grant, have been approved by theMinistry of Housing and Local Government and these schemes affect86k parishes in 53 rural districts. Since 191+9 the Ministry ofAgriculture, Fisheries and F*od have agreed to pay  some  325,000towards eg public rural water supply schemes.     Under both sets ofpowers such schemes are still being promoted and constructionalwork is going forward steadily.     It should be recognised, however,that many of the upland farms discussed in the Report can never be connected economically to a public piped water supply.Individual local supplies will have to be arranged.     Grants toassist the provision sf such supplies are available under agricul-ture legislation and also as part of the grants for house improvement.
22a    Steady progress is being made in iii-in.fi:ins eleoCi-icity tothe rural areas of Wales.      In 1948, only 1h per cent,  of farmsin Wales had a mains electricity supply, but by 1st April, 1956,the proportion had risen to nearly 1+0 per cent.     The growth of rural electrification was slow at first, because a high voltagebackbone network had to be established before supplies could betaken to many individual premises.      But now, more than 2,500farms are being connected to electricity mains in Wales each yearby the Electricity Boards,23,    In the part of rural Wales covered by the Report, the mileageof trunk and classified roads is 63 per cent,,  of the total ascompared with h8 per cent,  in the whole of England and Wales.This indicates that the proportion of roads for the maintenance and improvement of which money is made available from central funds, is already very high.    It would not be reasonable to contemplate any increase in the rate of expenditure on these roads.But the Government hope that, when economic circumstances permit, aconsiderable mileage of unclassified and unadopted roads can be improved for the benefit of agriculture and forestry with theassistance of grants from the Minister of Agriculture, fisheries and Pood under the provisions of the Agriculture (Improvementof Roads) Act, 1955.     This Act was introduced with the problemsof Wales particularly in mind as a result of the undertaking givenin paragraph 33 of the White Paper of 1953 (Command 901h).Co-ordination of Rural Development2h.    The Government have given the most careful considerationto the Sub-Commission&apos;s recommendation that machinery should beset up &quot;for ensuring that the development of upland areas isguided on economic lines without waste of resources.&quot;     They havealso been concerned to ensure that maximum results are achieved in the next few years.     Both these points were clearly in the
mindB of tho Ooimoil for Wales euvi Monmouthshire; itv veopnanendingthat a new body should be set up with such duties as assisting locaauthorities in the provision of basic services, of dealing withthe reorganisation of holdings, and providing fhe oo.....ox-aruatingmachinery needed to handle probior,w arising from the developmentof forestry.   The Government are unable to agree with the Council&apos;sspecific recommendations as to the nature of the body required,but they recognise the importance of improving, and,  if necessary,supplementing the existing machinery.25,   The Minister for   Welsh Affairs is able to keep a close watchon the development of Government policy in rural Wales, and, by consultation with his colleagues, to ensure co-ordination of thework being done.   For the planned development of the natural resources of rural Wales recommended by the Sub-Commission, however the Government accepts that it would be an advantage to providemachinery in Wales to co-ordinate the detailed implementation ofits policy.26.   Consultation between the Welsh Offices of Departments is ofcourse already an indispensable feature of   Government administra-tion, and the co-ordination of all Government activity in wales is entrusted to the Conference of Heads of Government Offices in wales under the chairman ship of the Joint Parliamentary Under-Secrctary of State for the Home Department.   But this conference is too large and has too wide a field of reference to give thenecessary detailed and continuous attention to the problems of rural Wales, which are primarily the concern of a limited numberof Departments, especially the Ministry of Agriculture, fisheries and Food, the Forestry Commission, and the Ministry of housing and Local Government.   The Government therefore propose to setup a small Standing Committee of the Departments principally concerned.   This Committee will consist of the heads of the welsh offices of these Departments, who are resident in Wales,   It willbe charged not only with co-ordination of the detailed implement a-tion of Government policy, but also with ensuring that action for the development of agriculture and forestry and the provisionof basic services is pushed ahead as fast as possible.- 10 -
The Government intend that this Committee shall assist and work through existing public authorities and shall aim at helping themto secure the development of each part of rural Wales in the manner that its special local circumstances require.   The Committee will consult with such persons and bodies as it feels will be able toithelp it and will be asked to consider whether the creation of aspecial advisory panel would be of assistance in its work.    Itwill in any case be asked to report regularly to Ministers and theprogress made will continue to be recorded in the annual white paper on Government Action in Wales.
