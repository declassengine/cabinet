CP. (56) 163I 5th July, 1956Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1956SECRET Copy No.   2 8CABINETBETTING AND GAMING bill memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department andMiNismr for Welsh affairs at the meeting of the Committee on Future Legislation on 19th June(L.F. (56) 4th Meeting) I was invited to circulate to the Cabinet a memorandumindicating the immediate economic and social consequences that could beexpected to follow from this legislation in the present circumstances.2. The arguments for introducing this Bill in the next Session rather thanin the Third Session of this Parliament are as follows:  (a) The Governments announcement of its intention to deal with this matter&quot; at the earliest opportunity&quot; has been widely applauded, and anexpectation has been aroused in the Press and public that thelegislation will be introduced in the next Session. If the Bill is not included in the programme, it may be taken outside as an indication that the Government^ resolve to tackle the matter is weakening.(b) The Government was criticised for its delay for several years in giving an indication of its attitude towards the Report of the Royal Commissionon Betting, Lotteries and Gaming, 1949-51. This fact makes theGovernment particularly vulnerable to criticism of further delay in implementing its promise to legislate on the lines of the Commission^recommendations.(c) The enforcement of the existing law places the police and the courts in difficulties, and indeed this was one of the chief reasons which havebeen announced for the decision to introduce legislation. these difficulties will, if anything, be increased by the knowledge that the lawis to be altered, and it is therefore desirable that the interim period before the new scheme comes into force should be as short as possible.(d) Although the Government^ decision to legislate has been welcomed, thereare misgivings in some quarters regarding the establishment of bettingshops. Those who criticise the proposal have no other constructivesolution to suggest, but there is a risk that opposition may have timeto grow if there is delay, and the passage of the Bill through Parliamentmade correspondingly more difficult.3. On the other hand, it can be argued that in present circumstances it isinopportune on economic grounds to introduce this measure. I doubt whether this argument carries much weight.4. In the Irish Republic there is one betting shop for every 5,000 people.On this basis the number of betting shops likely to be required in Great britain would be between 10,000 and 15,000, of which some 2-3,000 would be in theLondon area. If experience in the Irish Republic is any guide, the premises mostI suitable for betting shops are small retail shops, of which there are over 400,000in Great Britain.  The number of such premises required for betting shops is an50122
insignificant proportion of the total number of shops. From such enquiries as Ihave made, which suggest that there is a regular turn-over of the ownership of shops, I think that retail shop premises required for betting shops could be acquiredas part of that turn-over without recourse to special building. A few betting shopsin smaller places may involve the partitioning-off of part of an existing shop, butthe materials and labour required for this purpose would be negligible in comparison with those normally needed when shops are adapted and refitted on changes of ownership.G. LL.-G.Home Office, S.W.1,3rd July, 1956.
