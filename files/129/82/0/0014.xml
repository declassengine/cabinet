Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1956Copy No.CABINETLEGISLATION TO REORGANISE NATIONALISED ELECTRICITYMemorandum by the Minister of Fuel and PowerSir Winston Churchill stated in the debate on the address in November 1953that in the industries such as electricity supply where we do not propose to undonationalisation &quot; we have done and are doing our utmost to make a success of iteven though this may somewhat mar the symmetry of Party recrimination.&quot; Oneof the ways in which we have sought to redeem this pledge is by holding periodicalenquiries by independent Committees into the working of these industries. coal was reviewed by the Fleck Committee in 1954 and reorganisation on the lines oftheir Report (which did not recommend any changes requiring legislation) was putin hand forthwith. In the same year a Committee was appointed under theChairmanship of Sir Edwin Herbert to investigate electricity after its first six yearsof nationalisation, and in January of this year they presented a unanimous Reportrecommending fairly drastic structural changes.2. The most important feature of the Herbert Committee&apos;s diagnosis wasthat the electricity supply industry was losing efficiency through over-centralisation.This defect was attributed to the fact that the Central Electricity Authority was responsible not only for the generation and bulk transmission of electricity butalso for the finances of the industry as a whole, and in its discharge of this responsibility exercised close control over the activities of the 12 area distributionboards. This state of affairs cannot be remedied without legislation, and my proposals to change the statutory structure of the industry have been submittedto the Home Affairs Committee and approved in principle. Under them theCentral Electricity Authority would be divested of its responsibility for generationand bulk transmission, a separate generation board would be set up to carry out these activities, while the generation board and the 12 distribution boards wouldeach bear final responsibility for paying its own way. The Central electricity authority would be superseded by a new Electricity Council, representative ofboth generation and distribution but under independent chairmanship. the function of this Council would be not to direct the industry but to secureco-ordination through consultation, thus leaving the ultimate responsibility of theindividual boards unimpaired.3. I very much hope that we shall be able to implement my proposals by legislation next Session. It is now more than six months since the Herbert report was published and criticism is growing of the continued uncertainty in which theindustry is being kept.4. The Lord Privy Seal, in his paper CP. (56) 162, has made two pointsabout the desirability of introducing this Bill. He suggests that our new arrangements for financing the nationalised industries direct from the Exchequermay make this Bill less attractive to our own back-benchers because no action willbe possible for the time being on the Herbert Committee^ recommendation that each board should go to the market for its own capital. The separate raising ofcapital by each board first requires, however, that each board should be made responsible for its own financial affairs. This is not so under the present Statute;it would be so under my proposals. Thus my proposals could be presented as anCONFIDENTIALCP. (56) 1646th July, 195650128
essential prerequisite to a change in the method of raising capital, if and when sucha change should be deemed desirable and feasible.^ 5.   Secondly, the Lord Privy Seal suggests that an Electricity Bill might provoke a demand for legislation on the structure and management of other nationalised industries. Neither the Minister of Transport nor I foresee difficultyin resisting such demands, should they arise. There is no reason why the remediessuggested for one industry should necessarily be applicable to the others, and theHerbert Committee explicitly disclaimed an &quot; intention to lay down any principlesof organisation on which the structure of the nationalised industries should be founded.&quot;6.  The alternatives, as I see them, are these. Without a Bill next Session:  (a) we should be open to the charge of doing nothing to meet the HerbertCommittee&apos;s diagnosis of over-centralisation and of leaving this industry which is the chief instrument by which the benefits of nuclear power-are to be brought to the country with an organisation that is less efficient, and has been publicly and authoratively criticised by theHerbert Committee as being less efficient, than it could be made;(b) we should be thought to be flouting a Committee whose findings have beenhailed as being in accord with Conservative thought and as marking away in which Conservatives might constructively deal with onenationalised industry;(c) we should seem to be acknowledging a lack of faith in the usefulness of periodical outside enquiries as a means of improving the administrationof the nationalised industries; and to that extent we should be on weakerground in resisting the more inquisitorial and I think dangerous formsof Parliamentary supervision which many back-benchers desire.7. On the other hand, if we decided to legislate, we should be showing andit is surely most desirable to do so in the light of back-bench agitation onnationalisation that we had a positive policy for raising efficiency in this industryand for reforming the top-heavy organisation established for it by the Socialists.8. I trust, therefore, that we shall be able to legislate next Session on the lines proposed.A. J.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W. 1,4th July, 1956.
