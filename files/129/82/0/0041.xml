Printed for the Cabinet. July 1956SECRET Copy No.CP. (56) 19127th July, 1956CABINETUNITED KINGDOM COMMERCIAL policy note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of theBoard of trade we shall shortly be faced with the need to make certain decisions on commercial policy. This need arises specifically from the current proposal tocreate a Common Market in Europe and from the difficulties into which we are running on Imperial Preference with Australia. Some months ago, therefore, weasked officials to study a plan which might both meet these difficulties and at thesame time be of advantage to the United Kingdom economy, and we have on various occasions indicated to our colleagues that such a study was being made.2. An interim Report by a group of officials from the Foreign Office,Treasury, Board of Trade, Ministry of Agriculture, Commonwealth relations office, Colonial Office, Board of Customs and Excise, and the Bank of Englandhas now been completed and is attached. Further studies on this have still to bemade. But in view of the complexities of the issues that are raised we feel that itwould be of advantage if all members of the Cabinet were aware of the nature ofthe plan, so that they may be better able to form a judgment of the definite proposals which we hope to be able to make in four or five weeks&apos; time. We expect that we shall be submitting these matters to the Cabinet for decision early inSeptember.H. M.P. T.27th July, 1956.50236a
SECRETE.I. (56) 14 (Final)UNITED KINGDOM INITIATIVE IN EUROPEPLAN GInterim Report by OfficialsIntroduction1. In a memorandum dated 22nd May the President of the Board of Tradeput forward certain proposals designed to deal with the consequences of thedecision by the six &quot; Messina &quot; Powers (Germany, France, Italy, Holland, belgium and Luxembourg) to proceed towards the formation of a Customs Union. under such a Customs Union all these countries would, over a period of years, abolishtariffs and other restrictions on trade among themselves and would establish acommon tariff against imports from the rest of the world. They would thuscreate in their own territories a Common Market. The proposal put forward by the President was that the United Kingdom should associate itself with theCommon Market by means of reciprocal removal, by the United Kingdom andthe Customs Union, of their protective tariffs over a period of years and of other restrictions against each other. The United Kingdom would not, however, adoptthe common tariff of the members of the Customs Union against imports fromother countries, but would maintain its existing freedom of action in this fieldincluding the right to maintain Commonwealth free entry. There would thus be created what is technically described as a &quot; Free Trade Area &quot; between the customs union and the United Kingdom. In order, however, to safeguard both british agriculture and the Commonwealth interest in the United Kingdom market fortheir main products, agricultural products would be excluded from the operationof the scheme. The continuation of free entry for manufactured goods from theCommonwealth, and the maintenance of free or preferential entry for agricultural commodities, would give us some hope of retaining as much of our preference in commonwealth markets as would in any circumstances be expected.2. At a meeting of Ministers held on 31st May, under the Chairmanship ofthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, when this and other problems of a UnitedKingdom Initiative in Europe were discussed, it was decided that officials shouldmake a more detailed study of the possibility of a partial Free Trade Area of thiskind, including in particular the following points:  &quot; (a) an expansion .... on the lines suggested by the President of the Boardof Trade to make it more attractive to the Commonwealth, involvingmaintenance of free entry into the United Kingdom for manufactured products, continuation of preferential arrangements for agricultural products, together perhaps with some guaranteed purchase arrange-ments or other means of developing the United Kingdom market for commonwealth agricultural products;(b) the implications for United Kingdom industry of abolishing over a periodof time existing protective tariffs against Europe on manufacturedgoods;(c) the implications of the scheme for and the compatibility of it with the collective approach to convertibility and the G.A.T.T.;(d) the probable time-table of events in Europe if we decided to launch sucha scheme: how quickly or slowly it would be implemented and howquickly it would make an impact.&quot;3. The full study called for will take further time to complete. This paper is an interim report on the Plan and its implications in broad outline, withparticular reference to the points at (a) to (d) above. The paper is not submittedas a basis for decision at this stage. We aim to produce a final report in about amonth which would provide a basis for such a decision, which of course would still have to be subject to the result of such consultation inside and outside theCommonwealth as Ministers might think necessary and appropriate. But if thereare any points arising from this interim report to which Ministers would wish usto give further attention in completing our studies, it would be helpful for us toknow this as soon as possible.50236 - b
4.  This interim report is divided into four parts:  I. Description of a suitable &quot; Plan G.&quot; (Paragraphs 9-45).II. International implications Commonwealth, Europe, United States.(Paragraphs 46-58.)III. Implications for United Kingdom industry, agriculture, the balance ofpayments.  (Paragraphs 59-66.)IV. Points for further examination. (Paragraphs 67-69.)5. It is assumed throughout that the Messina &quot; Six &quot; (Germany, France, Italy,Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg) will form a Common Market or would be willingto do so if the United Kingdom adopted Plan G. Except in the case of France,which is moving towards a Customs Union with her overseas territories, it is notyet clear what other countries will propose for their dependent overseas territories.It is assumed that this Common Market would be on the general lines indicated intheir studies so far, involving the creation of a Customs Union by stages in12-15 years, far-reaching provisions for &quot; harmonising &quot; economic conditions andeconomic policies, and a governing structure including a Council of Ministers, acontrolling and supervisory European Commission, a Court of Justice, and a parliamentary Assembly. They are now engaged in drafting a treaty.6. It is assumed that during the period of formulation and implementation ofthe Plan, sterling and the currencies of European countries will be moving towardsconvertibility, and some or all of these currencies will become fully convertible.The Plan must therefore be examined against a background not only of presentmonetary arrangements but also of free movement of currencies.7. We would aim at building up Plan G on as wide a European basis aspossible; we have therefore assumed that the Scandinavian countries (although oneconomic grounds alone such a move would have little to commend it to Denmark),Switzerland and Austria would either join the Customs Union or enter into somefree trade arrangement with it and with the United Kingdom i.e., we assume theultimate abolition of tariff barriers on all trade (except agriculture) between theUnited Kingdom and all these countries, which for the purpose of this paper wecall &quot; Europe.&quot; Of the present members of the O.E.E.C., we should not expect,for a variety of domestic reasons, the Irish Republic, Portugal, Greece, Turkey orIceland to join. There are three possible European candidates from outsideO.E.E.C. Finland, Yugoslavia and Spain. Their inclusion would raise difficultieswhich would require further thought if the point seemed likely to arise.8. The main features of the Plan as it has so far emerged from our studies are summarised below for convenience. The reasoning which has determined thesefeatures, and the implications of the Plan at home and abroad, are elaborated insucceeding sections of the paper:  (a) The United Kingdom would enter a Free Trade Area with the Messina six and the other main O.E.E.C. countries.(b) The operation of the Free Trade Area would extend to all goods exceptagricultural produce (defined widely to include all foodstuffs for man and beast), and would not prejudice our freedom in regard to revenueduties, but there could be no other exceptions for industries whichmight be sensitive.(c) Apart from the exceptions mentioned in (b), all tariffs would be progressively reduced by all members of the Free Trade Area, andwould be eliminated within, say, ten years.(d) As quickly as possible within this period there would also be reduction andelimination of quotas and other restrictive or distorting devices overthe same field of products, save for an escape clause permitting theimposition of quotas in balance of payments extreme emergencies.(e) If the Plan is to be generally acceptable in Europe, our present belief isthat the United Kingdom would need to be ready to discuss with theother European countries the possibility of reducing barriers to tradein agricultural products.(/) The United Kingdom would retain freedom to continue free entry for commonwealth goods, and preferences for Commonwealth agricultural products.
(g) No special arrangements for Commonwealth agriculture have been worked out, since nothing really attractive to the Dominions could be offeredwithout drastic reduction in home agricultural production.I.-DESCRIPTION OF PLAN G9. The United Kingdom would by stages reduce and ultimately eliminateits protective tariff (and protective quotas) on imports (other than agriculture)from Europe;, the Europeans would take similar action. We should be free tocontinue Commonwealth free entry (subject to certain considerations described in paragraphs 31 and 32 below). We should retain existing freedom of actionin our tariff on imports from the rest of the world, subject to our commitments inG.A.T.T. and elsewhere. We should also retain our freedom of action in the field of revenue duties.10. Definition of &quot;Agriculture.&quot; We must first define the zone of&quot; agriculture &quot; to be excluded, and in which our tariff arrangements would not beaffected by the Plan. The definition must satisfy four conditions:  -(i) It must be clear and technically workable; the commercial policy on either side of the dividing line will become so fundamentally different thatthe line must conform to a commonsense principle.(ii) The section of trade of most importance to the Commonwealth must be excluded from the Free Trade Area in order to avoid infringing themain Commonwealth preferences in the United Kingdom market (bothon political grounds and to reduce the risk of loss of our preferencesin the Commonwealth).(iii) If possible, the most sensitive areas of European competition with UnitedKingdom agriculture and horticulture should be excluded.(iv) The definition must be acceptable to European countries.11. It is inherently attractive to seek to define agriculture as &quot;near to theground &quot; as possible. But some processing must be included to satisfy 10 (ii) and once a move, however small, from the raw product is permitted it is difficult inpractice to draw a satisfactory line anywhere. This leads inevitably to theconclusion that it would be better to make the excluded area sufficiently wide tocover all foodstuffs. This would be a reasonably simple definition to implement;Appendix A* discusses the problem of definition in detail. Defining the excluded area as &quot; foodstuffs (whether raw or processed) for man or beast &quot; appears ona preliminary examination as likely to have the following effect:  (a) United Kingdom agriculture, horticulture and fisheries would be shieldedfrom European competition in the home market to the same extent as now. The food processing industry would likewise be protected, but would not gain any new opportunities in the European market whicha definition of agriculture excluding processed foodstuffs would have provided.(b) The Dominions (Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa arethose most affected) should find the wider definition, excluding bothraw and processed foodstuffs from free trade, more acceptable thanthe narrower definition excluding raw agricultural products alone. TheColonies would&apos;welcome the exclusion of foodstuffs from the operationof the Free Trade Area, but the inclusion of certain importantagricultural products which are not edible might have some effect ontheir interests. Such products could not, however, be covered withouta major extension of the excluded categories, which could scarcelystop short of all raw materials, agricultural or otherwise.(c) The main industrial countries of Europe would probably find the definitiongenerally acceptable. Those countries with more important exports ofagricultural and horticultural products or of fish (Denmark, Holland.Italy, Norway) would be disappointed in any case by the exclusion ofan agricultural category, the more so by the extension of such a categoryto cover processed foodstuffs. However, the difficulty of full freeingof trade in agricultural products is so widespread that they cannot bevery hopeful.(d) The definition includes those products on which we have revenue duties with a preference element of value to the Commonwealth, and weshould therefore be able to keep this preference.* The Appendices are not reproduced here.50236 b 2
12. It is fundamental to the Plan that the area of exclusion, once demarcated,would not be capable of extension. The Plan would be unworkable if furthergeneral or special exceptions were periodically admitted.13. Removal of Tariffs. The Messina Six are working out a procedure forthe removal by stages of tariffs between themselves and, at the same time, moving towards a common tariff vis-a-vis the outside world. If we entered a Free trade area with them, they would lower and remove their tariffs on imports from theUnited Kingdom in the same stages as between themselves, so that no discrimination against us would arise. Concurrently we should be lowering and removing ourtariff on imports from Europe. Our existing freedom of action to determine tariffsfor imports from elsewhere would not be fettered by our terms of entry into theFree Trade Area, but our policy would in practice be influenced thereby (seeparagraph 15).14. For complete removal the Messina Six visualise a process of 12-15 years.From our point of view, a balance must be struck between the advantage of makingquick progress in securing the gains of the large market and the need for time tocarry out industrial adjustments. We think a rather shorter period, say ten years(the original Messina conception), would be better, but nothing much less than this would be practicable. Within this total period it would be vitally important to define clearly the successive stages. From the outset it would be imperativefor each section of United Kingdom industry to know how it is to be affected and at what rate. We should therefore favour a regular and settled programmeof &quot; across the board &quot; tariff reductions (though not necessarily by equal annualinstalments) with the minimum of exceptions. The Messina countries seem atpresent to contemplate a more flexible system allowing deferment of difficult cases and highly selective reductions. This would prevent United Kingdom industry from making a reasonable assessment of the new opportunities in Europe, and could cause it to lose protection in the home market before the new opportunitiesappeared. We should therefore press for firm and largely automatic arrangementsthroughout the Free Trade Area. This has a bearing on the timing of a decision.As the work in Brussels advances it will become more and more difficult to vary the procedures which are being worked out there. If Plan G appears on fullerexamination to be feasible, and if Ministers decide to go forward with the Plan,it would therefore be greatly to the United Kingdom advantage in this respectto act as quickly as possible so that we can influence the development of theCommon Market procedures.15. Commonwealth Duty-Free Entry for Manufactured Goods and RawMaterials. Manufactured goods and raw materials from the Commonwealth atpresent enter the United Kingdom duty free or, in a very few cases, at preferential rates. In entering a Free Trade Area with Europe we should, of course, insist that the United Kingdom freedom of action in our tariff policy vis-a-vis theCommonwealth (and other parts of the world) was in no way affected. However,our policy towards the Commonwealth would be influenced in practice, for ascheme would hardly be acceptable to Commonwealth countries if it involved the United Kingdom discriminating against them in favour of European countries.We therefore envisage the need to continue the existing policy of free entry for commonwealth goods. This, though not an integral part of Plan G, is aninescapable consequence of it. The Plan would thus put one more obstacle inaddition to those already existing in the path of any protection which we might in the future wish to give United Kingdom industry against competition fromthe Commonwealth, including textiles from the Asian Dominions and Colonies,and petrochemicals from Canada.16. The desirability of treating the Commonwealth not less favourably thanEurope would lead also to a progressive abolition of tariffs on those few importsfrom the Commonwealth which are at present subject to protective duty, of whichthe most significant are cars and rayon. This would form a separate subject for negotiation with Commonwealth countries (primarily with Canada) in the courseof which the United Kingdom might obtain counterbalancing assurances and concessions. Removal of the present duties on imports from the commonwealth would, of course, strengthen external competition with United Kingdom industry.Moreover, unless there was some modification of the application of the &quot; no newpreference&quot; rule (which does not appear probable), there would have to beconsequential reduction in our tariffs on similar products from the United States
and other countries. If United Kingdom industry can successfully face competition with free imports from Europe and the Commonwealth, the addition of the UnitedStates to the field of competition in the few products affected is unlikely to introduce a serious new threat in normal conditions. There might be special circumstances,however, such as a United States recession leading to a concentration of Americancar manufacturers on the European market, where such competition could be veryserious. Reductions in our most-favoured-nation tariffs on rayon would presentgreater difficulties in the event of unrestricted imports of these products from japan.17. Administrative Problems. The working of a Free Trade Area would impose additional tasks on Her Majesty&apos;s Customs and Excise and on UnitedKingdom importers and exporters, such duty-free admission of any consignmentof goods sent from one part of the Free Trade Area to another would necessitate the production of documentary evidence of origin within the Area. The work would be heavy and continuing, but the problems involved, though difficult, wouldnot be insoluble. Importers and exporters would be faced with the work ofobtaining documentary evidence in the due form for presentation to the Customsauthorities. Customs and Excise staff would have the work of scrutinising andverifying this evidence; the extra work would be similar in nature to that arisingfrom the Commonwealth preferences, but would be greater in volume and more complex. European countries without experience of similar work would probablyfind the new tasks of greater difficulty than the United Kingdom.18. Before the Plan could come into operation, many problems of definitionwould need to be resolved. The most thorny would be that of origin in the free trade Area, especially for products which result from manufacturing operationspartly within and partly outside the Free Trade Area. A qualifying criterion of origin must be established, and it will undoubtedly be difficult both to draw up acriterion which is generally acceptable in Europe and to apply it in practice. a fuller account of these problems is given in Appendix B.*19. Revenue Duties. We and everyone else will want to maintain revenueduties. In order that protective tariffs may not be introduced under the label ofrevenue duties, the nature of such duties will have to be defined beforehand; itshould be practicable to negotiate an acceptable agreement. Many of ourimportant revenue duties (including the tobacco and liquor duties see Appendix A*)would in any case be excluded by the definition of &quot; agriculture.&quot; The duties leftoutside this definition would be those on hydrocarbon oils, matches, mechanicallighters and playing cards; we should have to be ready to give up any element of protection within these duties. The only significant difficulty here would behydrocarbon oils.20. Other Protective Devices. It would be necessary to provide for theremoval of other protective devices within the Free Trade Area, such as quotas(see paragraphs 21-24), export taxes and controls, and export subsidies. these would have to be removed at an early stage in the process (as already envisaged by the Six).  We are examining this further.21. Balance of Payments Import Controls. It would be necessary for usto retain the right to impose import controls to deal with balance of payments difficulties. There should be no problem in securing agreement to this in the early stages, since initially the Messina Powers themselves are intending to work on theexisting O.E.E.C. and G.A.T.T. rules. At a later stage they might wish to makethe rules stricter in order to prevent ostensible balance of payments difficultiesfrom being used as a cloak for protective devices to frustrate the operation of theCustoms Union. We ourselves might well feel the same way, perhaps even earlier.It would indeed be intolerable if, during or after the process of dismantling theBritish tariffs, we found ourselves faced with quotas restricting access of our exports to the European market. For this reason we might well require stricterrules than those now prevailing in O.E.E.C. and G.A.T.T. in order to prevent theevasion of the objectives of the Free Trade Area. It would in any case be mostimportant for us to be able to ensure that the members of the Customs union should not in any circumstances apply quantitative restrictions against us if theywere not applying them against the other members of the Customs Union, or inany sense discriminate against us. Agreement on this point would be a major objective of our agreement with them.
22. So long as the rules governing import controls were as they are atpresent i.e., O.E.E.C. and G.A.T.T. rules no change in our present practicewould be implied. If, in order to prevent the use of quotas for veiled protection,we and the other members of the Customs Union/Free Trade Area wished tomake the internal rules of the Area more strict, we should not be able to discriminate against other members of the G.A.T.T. and I.M.F. when sterling wasconvertible; and to add to existing discrimination even to-day would raise majordifficulties with the United States and Canada and might frustrate the negotiation of the Plan. Discrimination contrary to our international obligations might leadto our being cut off from the resources of the I.M.F. But non-members of theArea would themselves be able to apply non-discriminatory Q.R.s under thelooser G.A.T.T. rules. We should thus be giving an advantage to non-membersof the Customs Union/Free Trade Area, by virtue of strengthening the rules ofthat Area, without any reciprocal advantages. Even if we could find ways round the problem of discrimination, the removal of Europe as well as the Sterling area from the realm where import restrictions can be applied (except under verystringent rules) would severely limit the extent by which we could restrict imports by quota.23. So far as our analysis has gone, it does not therefore appear to us that membership of a Customs Union/Free Trade Area would put on us any formalobligation restricting our present freedom to deal with balance of payments difficulties by quota restrictions. Our interest in the effective operation of theFree Trade Area, however, might make it essential for us to impose on others, andto accept ourselves, further limitations on the power to apply such restrictions.In view of the complexity of this problem we are giving further examination to it,and this must be counted no more than a provisional conclusion.24. Protective Quotas. The Messina Powers are agreed that protective as distinct from &quot; balance of payments &quot; quotas must be eliminated as quickly aspossible. This is clearly right and within a Free Trade Area the same rule mustapply. British industry would not tolerate elimination of the British tariff if the reciprocal elimination of other tariffs were frustrated by the maintenance orintroduction of protective quotas. The corollary is that we ourselves would haveto eliminate our own protective quotas, at least vis-a-vis our partners within theCustoms Union/Free Trade Area. By reason of the non-discrimination provisionsof the &quot; hard-core &quot; waiver under the G.A.T.T., our inability to impose protectivequotas against Europe might have some implications for our ability to invoke the hard-core waiver to meet possible United States or Canadian competition whenbalance of payments restrictions on imports from these sources have to be removed.This is a matter to which we are giving more detailed study. The problems whichwill be created for us in this field are not dissimilar from the problems arising fromthe elimination of tariffs which are dealt with in Section III of this paper.25. Organisation. We should wish the international management of theFree Trade Area to be conducted in O.E.E.C.: we should not favour the creationof a special Council of Association, as in our relationship with the Coal and steel community. For these purposes, we should envisage a &quot;Managing Board&quot; (at ministerial as well as official level) within the O.E.E.C., consisting only of themembers of the Free Trade Area, operating under Article 14 of the O.E.E.C.Constitution (which contemplates that the work of a group within the Organisationcan proceed without the positive assent and participation of non-members of thegroup, provided, of course, they agree to abstain).26. We are examining how this would actually work; prima facie, we donot see any insuperable difficulty. We attach importance to developing this inO.E.E.C.; first, because O.E.E.C. is the best instrument of European economic co-operation (if a move of this importance was not entrusted to O.E.E.C., then the Organisation could scarcely survive as a major instrument of economic policy),and, secondly, because it includes United States and Canada, and it would be necessary  to keep them closely in touch (we should, of course, keep the Common-wealth closely informed).27.   Harmonisation and Integration. Some arrangements, both within theCustoms Union and within the Free Trade Area, will be necessary to assist the participating countries in keeping their general economic policies broadly in step,in so far as these policies have external implications.  For example, manipulation    jof exchange rates could frustrate the operation of a Free Trade Area. &quot;Indeed,
procedures for such consultation already exist, for example, internationally inthe I.M.F. and in O.E.E.C. and also in the informal arrangements in the sterling area. There is a difficult balance to be struck between the evident need for flexiblearrangements of this kind and the views of the supporters of the Messina proposals that elaborate machinery and institutions are required. Our present view is thatwe should probably not wish to take part in such formal institutional arrangements,but much more detailed examination must be given to this question before we canfirmly advise Ministers.28. In addition to such general consultation or machinery to ensure thatparticipants keep generally in step with each other, it is maintained by the supporters of Messina that some harmonisation of economic and indeed social policy is necessary in order to promote free and fair competition. This raises a wide range of problems to which we are giving further consideration.29. Entry into a Free Trade Area with Western Europe would directly affectthe United Kingdom economy through the intensification of industrial competition;but there would be opportunities for advantage to be exploited too. This is discussed in Part III. In addition to the influences which would thus be at workon our industrial costs, including labour costs, there would be many other economicand social effects, particularly in the long term. For example, there might ultimately be a freer movement of capital and labour than now prevails. GivingEurope access to the London Capital Market could adversely affect the sterling area, unless in the event the resources of that market were increased by a flow ofEuropean investment funds through it. In many other fields we should be exposed to pressures to bring our economic, financial and social arrangements more closelyinto line with those of other participating countries; and to increasing pressure for closer political association with Western Europe. It is impossible to predictnow the force which these pressures will accumulate over a period to be countedin decades rather than years, or to assess how far we should wish to accede to them,or should be able to withstand them; but the political pressures at least, in viewof the political origins of the Common Market initiative itself, are bound to be strong.The Role of Agriculture in the Plan30. An important feature of the Plan is that agriculture (as defined inparagraph 11 above) would be excluded from the Free Trade Area becauseotherwise the Commonwealth preferences on food and agricultural products andalso the protection of certain parts of home agriculture would disappear. We were also asked to consider the possibility of developing the United Kingdom market for Commonwealth agricultural products in order to make the scheme as attractiveas possible to the Commonwealth.31. The preferences enjoyed by the Commonwealth countries in the UnitedKingdom market are not confined to agricultural products and their interests inthese items vary from country to country. The agricultural preferences are ofkeen interest to the Southern Dominions. Canada, in particular, while alsointerested in agriculture, would be more concerned about the loss of industrialpreferences vis-a-vis Europe. The South African interest is limited in the mainto the preferences on fruit and fruit products, including wines. The other commonwealth countries have a smaller interest.32. The preferences at present given by this country to the Commonwealthvary considerably as between products. Of the products of most vital interest tothe Commonwealth, wheat and maize, mutton and lamb are duty free from all sources, and beef and veal are subject only to very small duties. Barley flour andmost animal feedingstuffs have a 10 per cent, tariff; cheese has a 10 per cent, or15 per cent, tariff according to type. Manufactured foodstuffs carry a 10 per cent,to 15 per cent, tariff. A number of other products are subject to specific dutiesof which the present ad valorem incidence is: butter and milk products (4-6 percent.), oats (11 per cent.), shell eggs (5 per cent.). The duties on fresh fruit varywidely, the average being about 15 per cent. In general, these duties are morerelevant to competition of European producers with the United Kingdom producersthan with the Commonwealth countries owing to the difference of seasons. Someduties, however, do protect the Commonwealth from competition from &quot; third
countries,&quot; e.g., United States and Argentina. In addition to the sugar preferences,the Commonwealth obtains considerable further benefit from the commonwealth sugar Agreement; Australia also, benefits from the Meat Agreement. UnderPlan G the Commonwealth could retain the advantages mentioned in thisparagraph.33. Possibility of Increasing the Commonwealth Countries&apos; Share of theUnited Kingdom Market. The Commonwealth countries&apos; share in this marketcould only be increased save to the extent that United Kingdom consumptionmight rise at the expense of (a) Europe, (b) third countries, or (c) home production.The potential increase in food consumption due to population growth (about half per cent, per annum) is negligible. Given the present high level of nutritionin the United Kingdom, a rising standard of living leads generally to improvements in the composition of the diet and in marketing services, and not to greater total consumption. The question therefore is one of changes in the source of importsor in the home output. Appendix C* examines the existing pattern of trade in themore important agricultural commodities.34. A reduction of imports from Europe would be inconsistent with theobject of the Plan. Indeed, we may have to move the other way (see para-graphs 38-41), and to the extent we do this the Plan would tend to be less attractive to the Commonwealth. In any case, because the products either differ or arrive in different seasons, the Commonwealth agricultural preferences have less general effect on European trade than might be supposed, although on certain productsthe preference is important either in its practical or psychological impact.35. There would be considerable difficulty in practice in reducing importsfrom third countries in order to give advantage to the Commonwealth. such reductions could be material only from United States and Argentina as othercountries export so little of importance to us. Acceptability to the United states is a prerequisite of the Plan (paragraphs 54-56), and given the political problemof American agricultural surpluses and the strength of the farm lobby, it is clearthat any discrimination against the United States would create serious difficultiesin negotiating the Plan. Moreover, many of the tariffs on agricultural products in which the United States is interested are bound, in return for bindings on UnitedStates tariffs in which we have an interest. Discrimination against the Argentinewould have an unfortunate effect on trade relations which we are now hoping toimprove, and would possibly have damaging repercussions on our export prospectsin the South American market. In the case of meat we could only increaseCommonwealth exports at the expense of the Argentine by forcing the UnitedKingdom consumer to eat expensive frozen meat instead of the chilled meat forwhich he has always shown a marked preference.36. It follows from the preceding paragraphs that any increase in our importsof Commonwealth agricultural products would be almost entirely at the expenseof our domestic agriculture. There is no way in which our home agriculturaloutput could be sufficiently reduced to meet the problem without such a drasticalteration in our agricultural policy as appears to be politically impossible. Indeed,the Government is at present negotiating with the farmers a system of long-term assurances.37. Even if these difficulties were less formidable it would be impossible to guarantee the result of any reduction of domestic price support. A decrease in home production would not necessarily take place at once, and when it did theincreased imports which would follow might not come from the Commonwealth.A reduction of home wheat production, for example, might not only result in increased imports from France, Argentina and the United States rather than fromthe Commonwealth, but it might also lead to the production of more home barleythus displacing imports which come almost entirely from the Commonwealth,mainly from Canada.38. European Agricultural Aspects of Plan G. The exclusion of agriculturemust create great difficulty for Holland and Italy, and even more for Denmark,who would have little inducement to join the free trade area. The Messina Six arelikely to ask us to agree that agriculture should be treated in principle in the same way as industry, even if because of special circumstances the transitional period would have to be very much longer, and different arrangements would have to bemade in the meantime. We could not agree to this because, in order to provide
for long-term safeguards for the Commonwealth, we must propose the exclusion inprinciple of agriculture from the free trade zone. We have therefore thought it right, though it is not a part of the Plan we have been asked to study, to considerwhether some compensating proposals could be put forward which would in effectoffer greater opportunities for agricultural exports from Europe.39. Paragraphs 33 to 37 have described the difficulties in the way of developing the United Kingdom market for the basic agricultural commodities from Commonwealth countries. Similar problems would be faced in any attemptI to expand imports of the same commodities from Europe, in addition to thedifficulty that we could not do so without upsetting the Commonwealth. From theEuropean point of view this would rule out dairy products, in which Denmark and holland will be particularly interested, and wheat which is a French interest. Inthe case of eggs, a reduction in home support would benefit both Europe, and, to a lesser extent, the Commonwealth. For some of these products, e.g., eggs, theGerman market may be even more important to the European exporters than theUnited Kingdom market; there would therefore be pressure to include these items in any arrangements and if the Germans were willing to make concessions weshould be greatly embarrassed in resisting the European pressures.40. Assuming, however, we could hold this line, there might still be a fewproducts left, notably pigs and some horticultural items, of particular interest to europe. Even on these, accommodation with our home output would be difficult,but if any arrangement were on a modest scale and gradual in its operation, itmight be possible to do something by way of modification rather than byreversal of our agricultural policy. Quite apart from Plan G there will be pressure on us to do this, but the introduction of the Plan would intensify the pressure.Apples would present a problem of special difficulty because of the strong interestof United States, Canadian and European producers as well as of domestic growers.On the other products, we have no specific proposals to submit now, nor are welikely to be able to formulate anything precise in the time available to complete ourstudies. The scope, however, is likely to be limited.41. Trade with Europe in agricultural products is already liberalised withthe exception of apples and pears, processed milk, pigmeat and some sugar-containing goods. Pigmeat will be liberalised from 1st October. Any arrangements,therefore, to make the scheme more attractive to European countries would haveto take the form of either reducing tariffs or domestic supports. To give a publicundertaking to reduce supports over a period would be inconsistent with theAgricultural Acts. Tariffs afford protection to the horticultural sector which isnot otherwise supported. To attack the horticultural tariffs so long as the policyof supporting the other sectors of agriculture at anything like current levelscontinued in force would present formidable political difficulty. Although,therefore, some European countries might regard a new proposal for developingtrade in agricultural products within Europe (including the United Kingdom) as anessential adjunct of Plan G, it is very doubtful whether any sufficiently attractiveproposal could be put forward without seriously upsetting our home or commonwealth policy.42. Improvement of Consultative Machinery. We have also considered whether any of these agricultural difficulties could be alleviated by improving ourmachinery of consultation on food questions between the United Kingdom and theCommonwealth. The close daily contact maintained by our High Commissioners issupplemented by the United Kingdom-Canada Continuing Committee, the Anglo-Australian Food Committee, the Commonwealth Liaison Committee on more general issues, and by frequent ad hoc contacts between the Ministers and senior officials of the several Governments. If full use is made of these means of consultation, it may be that little advantage would be gained by creating new formalmachinery. On the other hand a joint Commonwealth-O.E.E.C. body bringing together producing and consuming countries on equal terms might be usefulthough it would have certain disadvantages. We are examining this questionfurther.Colonies43.   The nature of the Plan does not preclude the inclusion of the Colonies inI    the free trade area. The intentions of the Six in respect of their overseas territories are somewhat obscure. It is understood that the French have expressed the desire50236 c
to bring their Colonies into the Customs Union; if they did so, the Belgians would presumably wish to include the Congo. However, the proposal has not been thoroughly considered by the Six and may well be modified.44. It appears from a preliminary examination that if the United Kingdomjoined a Free Trade Area with Europe and if our Colonies were excluded, no significant damage to Colonial interests would result. However, this is only a provisional judgment on one of many possible hypotheses. We cannot push this examination much further without consulting Colonial Governments. If we go on with the Plan, the timing and procedure for consulting the Colonies will have tobe carefully worked out.45. Channel Islands and Isle of Man. It would be necessary to decide on the relationship between the Free Trade Area and the Channel Islands and Isle ofMan which at present enjoy free entry for their products into the United Kingdom.II.-INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS46. Independent Commonwealth. The Dominions would lose theirpreferential advantage for manufactured goods and raw materials in the UnitedKingdom market vis-a-vis European producers. This would hit Canada (thoughher important preference vis-a-vis the United States would be retained) and otherDominions which have, or are aiming to develop, exporting industries. With all commonwealth countries except Canada we have contractual obligations tomaintain margins of preference on a few manufactured goods and industrial rawmaterials. We shall have to secure their agreement for foregoing these preferencesvis-a-vis Europe, and we might in return have to forego some preferences we enjoy.The Plan would nevertheless leave the United Kingdom free to preserve for theDominions the following advantages which they now enjoy:  (a) Free or preferential entry into the United Kingdom for foodstuffs.(b) Free entry into the United Kingdom for all other products which are atpresent duty-free.Finally, the Dominions would gain by the abolition of the few existing tariffs (theonly important products affected being Canadian motor cars and rayon).47. If the United Kingdom were to put forward such a plan, would it satisfy the Commonwealth that the United Kingdom was not in economic terms tilting itsinterest away from the Commonwealth? Would the Commonwealth be reconciledto the loss of their preferences on manufactured goods and raw materials in theUnited Kingdom? Would the United Kingdom be able to retain (to the extentwe can anyway expect to do so) some or ail of the important preferences which united Kingdom exports enjoy in Commonwealth countries, particularly inAustralia, New Zealand and Canada? In view of our examination in para-graphs 33-37 of the scope for doing something to help Commonwealth exports of foodstuffs to the United Kingdom, we must discount the likelihood of our being able to make any play with this possibility.48. It will be necessary to consult our High Commissioners in commonwealth countries on the likely reactions in the Commonwealth. The best tentativeassessment which could be made at present is that Commonwealth? countries, intaking a view of any proposals we might make, are likely to have regard more to political and long-term considerations than to a nice calculation of the possible effects on their economic interests in the short term. Some might be glad to seecloser integration between the United Kingdom and Europe. Others, in Australiaand New Zealand in particular, are likely to fear that the United Kingdom wouldbe planning to look in future more to Europe than to the Commonwealth and thatwe would allow ourselves gradually to be drawn further and further into tighterbonds with Europe, first economically and then politically. They would be concerned as to the long-term effects of this on the readiness and the ability of theUnited Kingdom to co-operate with the Commonwealth in the fields of defence and foreign policy, to invest in the Commonwealth, and to develop our Common-wealth trade. The Canadian Government is likely to look coldly on proposalswhich are not in full and precise accordance with the G.A.T.T. which Plan G isnot and would wish to feel satisfied that the United Kingdom had not abandoned
its existing policy, agreed with the Commonwealth, of freeing trade and payments on a world-wide basis. The reaction of the United States Government wouldcertainly influence opinion within the Commonwealth. American hostility to thePlan (which would in any case block it) would provoke Commonwealth opposition;an enthusiastic reception by the United States would engender some Commonwealthsupport.49. As regards the direct economic effects on the Commonwealth, theinterests of Commonwealth countries as exporters of foodstuffs would be safeguarded for the present by Plan G. Their interests, actual or potential, in theexport of other products to the United Kingdom would be safeguarded by the continuation, under existing commitments and policy, of duty-free entry for commonwealth goods. The continuation, as a general policy, of duty-free entry for Commonwealth goods, including for example, textiles from the AsianCommonwealth, would appear to be an inevitable consequence of the Plan, thoughthe extent to which we continued to be committed to this, if at any time other commonwealth countries sought to revise their Ottawa Agreements with us, wouldbe a matter for negotiation in the light of the benefits we in return could continueto secure for our trade with them. At the same time, even with the continuation of duty-free entry, the Canadians, and to a lesser extent the Indians, would beworried about the loss of their preferences here vis-a-vis Europe on manufacturedgoods. Other Commonwealth countries which are developing their own industries would be reluctant to abandon the hope of establishing eventually markets forthese industries in the United Kingdom under the cover of existing preferences.The extent of these anxieties could be assessed only after consultation with theGovernments concerned.50. Europe. We should expect the Plan to be enthusiastically received bysome European countries, particularly the more highly industrialised. The plan would be a major encouragement to the &quot; European movement &quot; and to the supporters of the Messina initiative, who would see their hopes of tying Germanyinto Western Europe and creating a greater coherence in Western Europeaneconomy enormously strengthened. But in certain areas its effect is more difficultto predict at this stage. Some countries, in particular Denmark, Holland and Italy,would resent the exclusion of foodstuffs from the Free Trade Area proposed byus. Moreover, the United Kingdom suggestion to exclude foodstuffs might well lead to developments within the Customs Union. The Messina Six, though theyhave accepted in principle the inclusion of agriculture, are far from having worked out its implementation. Our proposal might lead to the lengthening of the transitional period, with a resulting economic loss to Italy and Holland that mightbe quite considerable; their political interest in the Customs Union, however, is so great that they would be unlikely to turn against it. The special problem of Franceis dealt with in paragraph 52. A number of European countries (notably the irish republic, Greece and Turkey see paragraph 7) would have little interest either in the Messina proposals or in Plan G. Provided that it can be arranged thatPlan G operates within O.E.E.C., they should be content.51. The Plan would, of course, be valueless if the diversity of reaction inEurope was such as to cause a serious split into supporters and opponents. Therisk of this happening would be minimised by anything that can be done to makethe Plan more attractive to the agricultural exporting countries (see paragraphs38 to 41).52, The probable reaction of France is particularly difficult to assess. Theproblems which France would face in joining the European Customs Union arevery great because of the profound effect on her economic structure of dismantlingprotection. The introduction of Plan G, with its exclusion of agriculture, shouldnot increase the French difficulty, of which a great part arises on the agriculturalside. The offer of the United Kingdom to participate in a Free Trade Area with europe would inevitably make the European Customs Union itself more probable,and would have on France a psychological effect of great importance. Such an offer would considerably strengthen the French supporters of a Common Market,and in particular would fortify those who desire a Common Market but are fearfullest it would lead in the absence of the United Kingdom to the preponderance ofGermany. The peculiar difficulties of France would lead also to problems in theworking of a Free Trade Area no less than of a Customs Union, since the French50236 *c 2
would inevitably lag in their performance behind the general progress (as theyhave done in O.E.E.C.) and would insist on escape clauses to enable them to do so.53. These conclusions are only tentative. Before a final judgment of the plan is taken by Ministers, it will be desirable to call for an appreciation of its probable effect from Her Majesty&apos;s representatives in some of the capitals concerned.54.&apos; United States. It appears likely that a proposal by the United Kingdomof this kind would be welcomed by many sections of United States opinion, amongwhom it is almost an article of faith that economic and political strength would flow from anything that appears to advance &quot; European integration.&quot; While these views would probably be shared by the State Department and by those responsiblefor planning United States defence policy, we should assume that, in the course of negotiations about the Plan, the Americans would try to gain the maximumsafeguard for their legitimate trade interests. Moreover, however attractive theproposals might be generally to American opinion, the implementation of them is bound to offend certain United States commercial interests, and these in certaincircumstances, e.g., declining trade, would become vocal. It cannot be excludedthat, during the long transition period towards the Customs Union-Free trade area, a minimum of ten years, or after the transition was completed, these interest might become sufficiently powerful to influence political opinions and to engenderfriction in United States-European relationships. Friction of this sort would be particularly embarrassing to the United Kingdom because of our special position vis-a-vis the United States.55. The positive support of the United States for the proposal is extremely important for its success. Without such support, not only would other Govern-ments both in the Commonwealth and in Europe tend to look askance upon it,but agreement of the G.A.T.T. to countenance the arrangements would hardly beobtainable. If the proposal were for a complete Free Trade Area with noexclusions, it should be possible to count on the certain support of the UnitedStates, which is too far committed by its past utterances to go back. However, the exclusion of agriculture should not lead us into serious difficulty with the UnitedStates, since they are not by virtue of their domestic arrangements in a strong position to criticise the special treatment of agriculture. Any expansion of thePlan by offering special concessions in the United Kingdom market for Common-wealth producers would make American acceptance of the Plan more difficult,since United States producers (notably of wheat) would almost certainly be amongthe losers.56. Our present judgment is that the United States would welcome our proposals. But this is only a provisional view. At a later stage it will be necessaryto obtain the opinion of Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington.57.   International Organisations (a) G.A.T.T.We and other countries in the Free Trade Area will wish tocontinue to enjoy the tariff and other benefits which membership ofthe G.A.T.T. confers on us in all our trade outside the area. Weshall all require a waiver from the G.A.T.T. to cover the operations of the Free Trade Area because the exclusion of agriculture would cover such a substantial proportion of the total trade. Provided thatthe Commonwealth and the United States are favourably disposed towards the Plan, the waiver should be obtainable without difficulty.It does not appear that any change in the articles of G.A.T.T. wouldbe necessary. The functioning of the G.A.T.T. as an institution wouldnot be damaged so long as the United Kingdom and other countriescontinued to follow its objectives and principles. We are giving further examination to this question.(b) I.M.F.Provided that we abide by the articles of the I.M.F., our right of access to the resources of the Fund should not be endangered.  It doesnot appear that the Plan would require any changes in the articles ofI.M.F.; in any case, it would be impracticable to amend them.  We    (jare giving further examination to this question.
(c) O.E.E.C.Provided that (i) our initial assumptions prove correct and scandinavia and Switzerland are associated with us in a Free trade area or Areas with the Messina Customs Union;(ii) satisfactory machinery can be worked out so that those members of O.E.E.C. not within the Customs Union/Free Trade Area, while not able to block discussions ordecisions affecting that area, do not appear to be excludedfrom effective membership of O.E.E.C.;the proposals should have a wholly valuable and invigorating effect upon O.E.E.C. and the policies for which it stands.58. External Economic Policies and the Status of Sterling. While a great part of our external economic policy is built around the three institutions mentionedabove, they do not by any means cover the whole of it. We have not yet beenable to examine how far this Plan would be compatible with those policies andwith the international status of sterling, and we propose to look into this questionfurther; in particular, we need to examine how far the Plan would be likely to affect the Sterling Area itself.III.-IMPLICATIONS FOR UNITED KINGDOM ECONOMY59. Industry. It is impossible to make a firm prediction of the effect ofPlan G on United Kingdom industry in general, or even on particular industries.We have made a preliminary assessment for some of the major industries, and this can be developed and expanded later on when Production Departments can be consulted. Even then there will be many unknowns, such as the response ofEuropean and United Kingdom industry to freer competition. It should bepossible, however, to list those industries which would stand to gain most, thosewhich would be most vulnerable and those (not necessarily the same) which wouldbe most vocal in their objections. We would not be able to avoid difficulties byexcluding &quot; sensitive &quot; industries from the Plan (paragraph 12).60. The preliminary assessment is at Appendix D.* Briefly, the &quot; gainer &quot;industries would include most branches of engineering and capital goods, high-quality woollen goods, man-made fibres (except rayon), and probably iron andsteel. The losers would include clocks and watches, silk, cheap rayons, certainelectrical equipment, dyestuffs, optical and scientific instruments, certain finechemicals, pharmaceuticals, cheap woollens and paper and board; some of these have enjoyed special protection on &quot; strategic &quot; grounds. The effect on the cotton and motor-car industries is very difficult to predict, but they would probably beamong the most vocal objectors. Two general comments can be added. First,among the industries most likely to gain additional opportunities would be thosein the capital goods sector. Most industries in this sector are already operatingat full capacity and are likely to remain so for some years to meet the continuingdemands for economic development in the Commonwealth and elsewhere. these industries might therefore find difficulty in taking full advantage of the additionalopportunities, at least until there had been increased investment in them and somemovement of labour from those consumer goods industries which would tend to contract. Second, many of the light industries which have settled in theDevelopment Areas would appear on the vulnerable list.61. In general, the effects both on the export and import side will almost certainly prove to be widely spread throughout industry, since in almost everysector of industry there may be lines in which we have some advantage and couldincrease exports, and other lines where we may be at some disadvantage andmay find imports increasing at the expense of home production. But the variety of our production and export trade is too immense to make any precise assessmentpossible. The effects will almost certainly be wide in terms of the number of individual adjustments, but many of these would be individually small; on theother hand, some small industries may suffer severely. There might be a greatdeal of political protest but the total result (leaving aside such big individualproblems as motor-cars) would not be large in relation to our total industrialturnover.
62. From the preliminary assessment we can form the negative conclusionthat the Plan would not be disastrous for any principal sectors of the UnitedKingdom economy. Whether the gains would exceed the losses is a hazardousprediction. Much would depend on the resourcefulness and adaptability of UnitedKingdom management and labour. The process of adjustment would, of course,be easier if the United Kingdom economy as a whole was expanding rather thancontracting or static. The preferential advantage that our exports would receiveunder the Plan vis-a-vis the United States might well lead to some replacement ofUnited States products by United Kingdom products in markets such as Belgium,where dollar liberalisation is nearly complete. We cannot expect, however, thatthere will be equivalent switching in our imports from the dollar area because formany of these United States supplies (e.g., of raw materials) could not be replacedfrom within the Free Trade Area. The introduction of a Free Trade Area shoulditself create a total gain in prosperity within the Area; and, given that we can secure our share of this, the benefits we should thus ultimately reap may providethe major advantage of the Plan to the United Kingdom.63. We must, however, be clear about one thing in the risks which we mustrun if Plan G is to be implemented. Even our big industries with substantialexports have developed in recent years on the basis of a protected home market plus preferential export markets in the Commonwealth. Under Plan Gthey will have a much larger &quot; domestic &quot; market but within this they will have to compete with European industry; but the preferences we should hope to retainfor United Kingdom exports to Commonwealth markets should provide themwith some cushion of advantage over their European competitors. These bigindustries are obviously not going to go under, but their profits may be squeezedand this may have repercussions on what they can set aside for re-equipment anddevelopment. On the other hand, to some extent the same situation applies tobig firms in other countries and things may even themselves out. We cannot,however, tell if we shall on balance break even or tend (for a time at any rate)to lose. What is important is to realise that if we tend to lose, something must givesomewhere. A little give on many fronts might be all that is necessary. Somescaling down of profits, and of excessively high wage rates, harder work here andthere, less restrictive practices on the part of labour. If in the event the adjustmentrequired turns out to be greater than can be accommodated in the ways mentioned,then in the ultimate resort there would be pressure either upwards ordownwards on the exchange rates. The same, of course, is true for all othercountries entering the Free Trade Area, and it must be accepted as one of the risks.64. Balance of Payments. The effect of a Plan of this kind on the UnitedKingdom balance of payments must depend primarily on its effect on Britishindustry. Many new opportunities would be created, but our ability to profit from them will depend on the competitiveness of British industry in the future. Underinvisible transactions we should certainly hope to gain on balance from ourearnings on services.65. Agriculture. The exclusion of agriculture from the Free Trade Areameans that the main structure of the Plan would not affect United Kingdomagriculture. To the extent, however, that it proved possible and desirable for thePlan to be accompanied by greater opportunities for European agricultural exports,there would have to be a certain adjustment in our home production spread overa lengthy period. No assessment of the impact on our farmers and growers canbe made until further details are worked out. We have assumed that a drasticalteration in our agricultural policy is politically impossible, but even if such radicalalteration were made it is doubtful if any opportunities really attractive to theCommonwealth would emerge (see paragraphs 33 to 37).66. The United Kingdom Consumer. The United Kingdom citizen has an interest in these proposals as a consumer and as a taxpayer as well as a producer.Generally he should profit through the greater availability of goods at a lower price;it is he who reaps the benefits of the large market. But his gain might be reduced if any action which proved necessary and feasible on the agricultural front should lead to higher costs. By increasing United Kingdom costs generally these wouldmake British industry less able to benefit from the Plan and so defeat the object forwhich concessions on the agricultural front were made.
Treasury Chambers,Great George Street, S.W. 1,23rd July, 1956.67. There are still considerable difficulties to be worked out and detailed examination of the repercussions of this Plan to be made. A list of the furtherstudies we propose to make is set out below. It must be appreciated that not allare of the same nature. Some will bear on the main decision of policy; others are of the type inevitably arising from any new development in the normal courseof working it out:  (a) Examination of whether the Plan could be made more acceptable to europe in the agricultural sector.(b) Investigation whether the Plan could be made more acceptable to theCommonwealth by the development of joint Commonwealth/O.E.E.C.consultation on agricultural matters.(c) Study of the organisation within O.E.E.C. to work the Plan.(d) Further examination of the effect of the Plan on our G.A.T.T. and IMF.commitments; and of whether the Plan would limit more strictly thepower to restrict imports for balance of payments reasons.(e) Examination of the compatibility of the Plan with existing economic policies.(/) Study of the monetary implications of the Plan and its effects on the sterling Area (including possible effects on the raising of capital andthe development of commodity markets in the United Kingdom).(g) Investigation of the measures required to keep in step the economic policies of the United Kingdom and of European countries in so far as these policies have external implications.(h) Further study of the effect of the Plan on United Kingdom industry.(/) An appreciation of how far the Plan would be attractive or otherwise tothe individual Dominions and Colonies.(/) Further assessment of whether the United States is likely to approve of,oppose, or merely acquiesce in the Plan.(k) Further study of the probable attitude of the countries of Western Europe.68. Under (h) above, we do not expect to be able to take our study ofparticular industries much further, even after consultation with production department. We should hope, however, to prepare an analysis of the broadeconomic effect on our industry over a period of 10-15 years. We may be ableto take 67 (/) some way further, but not much progress on (/&apos;) or (k) is likely at thisstage.69. Whatever may be the result of these further studies, one feature of thePlan must remain constant. An announcement to embark on the Plan would startus on a path of progressive reduction leading towards ultimate elimination of muchof the protection now enjoyed by British industry. If and when the final stage ofthe Plan was reached, United Kingdom industry would be completely exposed tocompetition from Europe. We have indicated in paragraph 3 that we will devotefurther study to any points which Ministers consider to deserve greater attention.But this is not a feature of the Plan which can be modified.
