secret.P. (56) 19828th July, 1956UNESCO; NINTH GENERAL conference memorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations and the Minister of education the Ninth General Conference of the United Nations Educational,Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) opens in New Delhi on 5th November this year, and is likely to be attended by delegations from most of the seventy-five Member States of the Organisation.    With our colleagues from the Treasury, Foreign Office, Colonial Office and duchy of Lancaster, we have been reviewing United Kingdom policy towardsUNESCO, and have reached the following conclusions.2.   United Kingdom Membership of UNESCOOur membership of UNESCO in the past has been largely a waste ofmoney.    We could have spent - and could now spend - our contribution ofsome  300, 000 a year to greater advantage on a bilateral basis.However, the Russians and their Satellites have now become activemembers, and they will certainly regard UNESCO as an instrument forfurthering their own political aims.    We consider (and the United states representatives and some of the Commonwealth representatives whom wehave consulted agree with us) that we should not leave the field to theRussians, but should take the offensive in pressing our own point of view,and steering the Organisation in directions least harmful to us.3.   General Policy at New DelhiIn taking the initiative, as suggested above, we propose that theUnited Kingdom should adopt the theme of &quot;Freedom for the Mind&quot; as abasic criterion which should be met by all items in unescos programme.We would also propose to put forward constructive proposals for substitutingin the programme useful items for wasteful ones.    We should simultaneouslypress for economies, and particularly for administrative economies,wherever possible.However, we have concluded that it will be politically impracticable to prevent any increase in the budget.    The present budget is about$10 millions a year, and the Director-General (Dr. Luther Evans) is toask at New Delhi for an increase of about     million a year.    (One halfof this increase is accounted for by the cost of a new headquarters building &apos;now under construction in Paris - the building of which we consistentlyopposed).    The United States seem ready to Support this increase, as theprice for taking a positive, constructive line, and, although we should attempt to secure their agreement to a smaller figure (with a programmeCOPY NO.CABINET
to match) we have concluded that the delegation should have the discretion to agree to a maximum increase of $\ million a year if it seems politicallynecessary to do so.    The cost to the United Kingdom would be about 15,000 a year.4.     &quot;Asian-Western Cultural Values&quot;There seems no doubt that there will be strong Asian support at new Delhi for a project on the promotion of the &quot;mutual appreciation ofAsian and Western cultural values &quot;.    We have concluded that, particularlyin view of the opportunities such an item would provide for the Russians(who have already indicated their support) we must also support it, and takethe lead in offering constructive proposals.    Representatives of theUnited States, and of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan and ceylon have expressed agreement with this view.We would, however, insist that the inclusion of this item shouldentail no further increase in the budget.5.     United Kingdom Delegation to New DelhiThe Conference will be politically important because it is being heldin India, because of the strong interest which we expect the Russians totake in it, and because of its importance for Commonwealth relations andour relations with Asian countries as a whole in the short term.    We have therefore concluded that the delegation should be led by a senior Minister,and recommend that this be the Minister of Education, and that he be supported by a strong team.6.     We accordingly seek the approval of the Cabinet to the following:-(i)    The United Kingdom should remain a member of UNESCO.(ii)   We should be represented at the New Delhi general conference by a strong delegation led by theMinister of Education.(iii)    The brief for the delegation should be based on thetheme &quot;Freedom for the Mind&quot;, and should includeas its main objectives:-(a) as small a budget increase as possible,with a $1 million increase over twoyears as an absolute maximum;(b) positive support for the Asian-WesternProject, subject to the financiallimitations in (a);(c) reorganisation of the rest of theprogramme to substitute useful forwasteful items, together withadministrative economies.H. &apos;D.E.27th July, 1956.
