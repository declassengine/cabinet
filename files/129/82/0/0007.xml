THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTFORCES CONDITIONS OF SERVICE IN germany memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer it is now clear that, failing any major change of policy, the Armed services are faced with expenditure of some  64 millions a year on local costs in Germany( 70 millions if troops exchanges are taken into account), against which in 1956-57we are likely to receive no more than  34-35 millions from support costs. We arefacing therefore additional expenditure in Germany of some  30- 31 millions this year.2. In CP. (56) 155 the Secretary of State for War recognises the imperativeneed for the utmost economy in this expenditure. There has been a study of possible economies in Germany by a Ministerial Committee under the Chairmanship of theMinister of Defence; but this has so far yielded firm savings of less than  1 million;and it may well be that any other savings which can be made this year will be offset by the necessity of paying increased wages to large numbers of german civilians employed by our Forces in Germany.3. As the Secretary of State for War explains, there are three items on whichthe Service Departments and the Treasury have been unable to resolve their differences.I. Family RationsIn asking that the changeover should be postponed, the Treasury had inmind not only our budgetary and balance of payments difficulties, but alsothe embarrassment of justifying an increase in these burdens at a time when weare impressing upon the Germans, and upon our other Allies, how very difficultour present situation is.II. Batmen for Officers of Army Static UnitsThe Treasury has been pressing for a reduction to the normal (UnitedKingdom) scale. This scale, which allows one batman to be shared between three or four officers up to the rank of major, one between every twolieutenant-colonels, and one for each officer of the rank of colonel or above,is generous enough, even if, as the Secretary of State for War has pointed out,officers in Germany wear uniform constantly and are frequently out on training exercises.III. Domestic Service for FamiliesService Ministers originally proposed new arrangements which would have provided one domestic servant for each officers family and half that amount of domestic service for other ranks&apos; families from sergeant upwards at a cost of 1 million: they are now prepared to go a little further and make new proposals which would reduce annual expenditure to  750,000 all of it indeutschemarks.Printed for the Cabinet.

4. If the Services&apos; proposals are accepted in full, the effect would be toincrease our local costs in Germany from 1957-58 onwards at tjie rate of about 700,000 per annum, whereas what I want to do is to reduce the bill. As I have emphasised again and again, we have got to take our foreign exchange positionvery seriously indeed particularly, I think, where expenditure in Germany isconcerned. We may eventually have to make the concession sought by theServices on the family ration arrangements (though I personally hope that, when that time comes, the amount involved will be a good deal smaller than  1-2 millions per annum). The crucial point however is the continuance of free domestic service on a substantial scale to officers (who already receive the services of batmen) andto sergeants and above of the other ranks.5. I do not believe that this is a reasonable demand for the Services to make on the United Kingdom economy at the present time.6. The Services&apos; case, as made in discussion, rests on the followingarguments:  -(a) The conditions of our troops in Germany ought to have regard to theconditions in German civilian life.-\ do not know what proportion ofGerman middle-class families have domestic servants though it may be higher than is the case in the United Kingdom. But I do not believethat we can afford to &quot; keep up with the Joneses &quot; in Germany at a costof  750,000 per annum.(b) The forces in Germany have had this concession for some time and itswithdrawal would be most unpopular and affect re-enlistment. Thepoint is, of course, that this is a legacy from occupation days and thatsomebody else has been paying. People in the forces will, I am sure,realise that the situation is different when this heavy new burden fallson their own people in the United Kingdom; and that they cannot hope to retain a concession which is equivalent to paying about  200 a yearmore to officers and about half that amount to sergeants and above.;As regards re-enlistment, I should be surprised if this considerationapplies to officers. To the other ranks, as to officers, substantial pay increases have recently been given which should help greatly in providing domestic help for those families which require it.7. I recognise that it is sometimes difficult to bring an arrangement of thiskind, however. Jj&amp;Je m^e^Jo^an ,$nd. overnight. I am prepared, therefore, toagree thatLnbrv.it nnlTTne^amount of OTtnestic service proposed by the service ministers should be allowed during the remaining part of this financial year, butonly if it is also agreed that, from the beginning of the next financial year, this concession will be withdrawn altogether.conclusion.   I invite my colleagues to agree that (1) Service families should continue to be supplied with rations by the royal army Service Corps for the remainder of this financial year, thepossibility of abolishing this arrangement being reviewed before1957-58 Estimates.(2) The scale of batmen for Army Static Units should be the normal (UnitedKingdom) scale.(3) In the remainder of the 1956-57 financial year domestic servants shouldbe provided on a much reduced scale not more than two-thirds1 ofwhat Service Ministers are now proposing but thereafter thissubsidised domestic service should be withdrawn completely.1H.
