Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1956SECRET Copy no cp. (56) 1665th July, 1956CABINETBUILDING control memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer am circulating with this paper the recent exchanges in Parliament on thesubject of building licensing. I am not now asking for any decision except thedecision not at present to reach a final decision.2. We should deal with this matter on practical and not on doctrinairegrounds. For my part, I am still considering where the practical balance ofadvantage may lie during the next few years.3. The advantages of building control, as a permanent weapon in the armouryagainst inflation, are obvious. If we had had this control at our disposal duringthe past year we would have used it, and we would have been glad of it.It would have helped us to damp down the excessive pressure of demand. Itwould also have helped politically; for it is obviously unfortunate that petrolstations should have become the &quot; ground nuts &quot; of current political controversy.I do not suggest that we should return to building control at the moment. But weshould not be afraid to learn from the lessons of our recent experiences, when weare devising our constructive economic policy for the future.4. We ended building control in November 1954 because it seemed as thoughthe building industry would be able to meet all demands on it in 1955. In other words, we assumed that building control was analogous to food rationing or rawmaterial allocation a control to be ended as soon as the building industry had over-come the shortage of bricks and mortar. I think it is now clear that this view was too simple. It is not the building only that counts. It&apos;s what goes into the building tools, equipment, &amp;c. Building control is very different from other forms of domestic physical control in that it is, in effect, a control on investment. Inretrospect, it was clearly a pity that we removed this control just when an investmentboom showed signs of getting under way and out of control.5. In 1954 my predecessor rightly took steps to stimulate investment.To-day, there is a wide consensus of opinion by no means confined to any onepolitical party that Britain needs to devote greatly increased resources toproductive investment if she is to maintain her position in world trade. But the events of the last year have shown very clearly that an investment boom, once itgains momentum, can well up and overwhelm us like a flood. Monetary policy is inevitably slow to operate upon the economy at a time when a very large numberof investment projects have already been embarked upon. Furthermore, there is what economists would term the &quot; multiplier effect&quot; of an investment boom. Ifwe stimulate productive investment, then non-productive investment (officeblocks, &amp;c.) and consumption will tend to rise as well. Thus we need to have sufficient weapons in our economic armoury to ensure that we can achieve anincrease in our capital wealth without the risk of inflation due to excess of total demand.  It is this that we failed to do in 1954 and 1955.  &quot; Hinc illae lachrymae.&quot;50123
6. There is also the balance of payments aspect. Our ambition is to achieve a regular annual balance of payments surplus of at least  300 millions. In the longrun, an increase in the level of productive investment will prove essential if britain is to maintain her position in world trade. Yet in the short run, we have seen to ourcost, an investment boom can have a severe impact on our balance of payments especially as our export markets are largely markets for investment goods. I have serious doubts whether we shall find it practicable to resolve these difficulties, evenif substantial reductions are made in defence expenditure, by monetary andbudgetary controls alone though of course they will still have a major part toplay. It may therefore be desirable, as a matter of long-term policy, to reintroducebuilding licensing as a means of keeping an investment boom under control.7. I have not finally made up my mind what to recommend on this matter.Building licensing is, of course, a detailed and expensive control to administer;though the number of staff required does to some extent depend on the licensinglimits in force. There is also the political difficulty. But it is worth rememberingthat, at the present time, no one can borrow from the market or by issues of shares even privately more than  10,000 without my consent. It does seem ratherabsurd to argue that our principles permit this interference with individual liberty,but that they forbid us to exercise direct control over building projects however much they cost. I think much would depend on our being able to represent there introduction of building control, not as an expedient forced on us bycircumstances, but as part of a constructive policy designed to raise the level of investment (without exposing us to the risk of renewed inflation) and to strengthen the pound.8. To introduce building licensing would, of course, require legislation. I donot intend to propose this course to my colleagues in the immediate future. But Ishall continue to weigh the arguments carefully during the next few months, and Imay feel bound to recommend that we take the necessary legislative powers. I hope,therefore, that my colleagues will feel able to avoid taking firm positions in public,for or against, at any rate on dogmatic grounds.H. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.
AnnexeHansard, 12th June, 1956, Cols. 232-333 and 34. Mr. H. Wilson asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) whether,in view of the continued strain to which the economic system is subject, he will now introduce legislation to enable Her Majesty&apos;s Government to control less essential building developments;(2) whether he will now reinforce his existing policies for the support of sterlingby introducing control over less essential imports.35. Mr. Hunter asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether, with a view to strengthening the Governments financial and economic policy, he will nowreintroduce building licences.38. Sir R. Boothby asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether he will introduce legislation to enable him to bring private building under control.Mr. H. Macmillan: I made my position clear in the debate on the economicsituation on 20th February. In my view these matters should be decided on practical and not on doctrinal grounds. This is the principle of the Middle Way, from whichI have never swerved.Mr. Wilson: But is the right hon. Gentleman aware, in respect of buildinglicensing, that despite the harsh measures which he has introduced, in many directions, of monetary control, there is still an overload on the national economy,caused partly by inessential building? If he were to apply practical considerations to the matter, would he not apply control to that rather than to essential buildingwhich he has stopped?Mr. Macmillan : There are practical considerations, and those are the ones thatI have tried to apply. There is a balanced argument here. I have heard a greatdeal about the expenditure on petrol pumps, for example, but the actual expenditurein the last year of control was  4 million and last year was  7 million. When it isremembered that there are twice the number of cars that there were in 1939, thereis a certain argument there. The total of private and miscellaneous buildingamounts to about 8 per cent, of the whole, but I am not denying that it might be convenient to have this weapon in our internal armoury under certain conditions.All I say is that I try to judge these matters on a practical and not a dogmatic basis.Sir R. Boothby : Would the right hon. Gentleman not agree that in our presentrather difficult economic situation it is not justifiable to continue to build such things as offices, dwelling-houses and petrol pumps without any limit whatsoever?Would it not really be desirable to take powers, even if they were very moderatelyexercised, to prevent completely wasteful expenditure?Mr. Macmillan: Yes, Sir, but as my hon. Friend knows, and as I have said,while I do not deny that it might be useful to have this weapon in our armouryit would require legislation and, so far as I can see, we have quite a lot of legislation to get through.Mr. Hunter: Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that some newspapers whichsupport the Government have reported that he is considering reintroducing buildinglicences as an aid to his economic and financial policy? Are we to take it thatthe right hon. Gentleman&apos;s replies are a denial of those newspaper reports?Mr. Macmillan: I have referred to what I said in the debate on 20th February,and I stick to it. I said then:&quot; I do not think that either side of the House was very much enamouredof the building control. But I have not ruled it out of my thoughts.&quot; [official report, 20th February, 1956; Vol. 549, c. 46.]
