secret.P.(56) 196 COPY NO.1st August, 1956CABINETCHRISTMAS ISLANDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies in March, 1956, Mr. Menzies sent a message to the Prime Ministerasking that sovereignty over Christmas Island be transferred to australia or else that its administration be separated from, that of the Colony of singapore.    A copy of the message from the Australian Prime minister is attached at Annex I.    In making this request the Australian Govern-ment have in mind their economic interest in the Island which they fearmight not be recognised by a future independent Government of Singapore,and are also concerned with the Island&apos;s strategic importance both as apossible air base and in the context of long-range weapon testing and research, because of its situation along the line of prolongation of theAustralian rocket missile range.2.     Christmas Island (not to be confused with the Christmas island in the Pacific Ocean) lies in the Indian Ocean about 230 miles south of thewestern extremity of Java and is 64 square miles in area.    further details are in Annex II.3.     The Prime Minister has asked for the views of the commonwealth secretary and of myself on the reply which should be made to theAustralian request.    He feels that the political difficulties of arranging for the transfer of Christmas Island to Australia are too great to be faced just now.    He considers that there would also be some political criticism if the Island were detached from Singapore and brought underthe direct administration of the United Kingdom and that this course isalso open to the objection that it would involve the United KingdomGovernment in immediate expense, for example through having to compensate Singapore for the loss of revenue.4.     The Chiefs of Staff Committee have undertaken an assessment of the Island*s strategic value and have concluded that at present thisconsists solely in its phosphate deposits and in its position in relationto the Australian rocket range.    The construction of an air strip (whichthe Japanese began during the war but did not complete) is thought to be practicable although expensive and could give the Island a strategic importance as an air staging post.    The Chiefs of Staff conclude that,as any development of the Island as an air base would be mainly in australian interest in support of ANZAM and as Australia has at presentthe preponderant economic interest in the Island, it would be betterfrom a military point of view for its administration to be transferred tothe Government of Australia.
5.     Although Singapore derives some economic advantage from the connection  with Christmas Island that connection is one based rather uponadministrative convenience than upon any racial or geographical affinities.The islanders themselves have not had the benefit (if that is the right word)of the recent constitutional advances in Singapore and the Governor has said that it is most unlikely that they would derive any advantage from a self-governing Singapore.    There is therefore no intrinsic reason whythe Island should continue to be associated with Singapore.6.     Accepting that the political difficulties involved rule out thetransfer of Christmas Island to Australia now, there remain two possible courses to take in response to the Australian request.    The first wouldbe to assure Mr. Menzies that we would use those reserved powers whichwe would retain even when full internal self-government is achieved bySingapore in order to safeguard Australia!s strategic interest inChristmas Island.    The second would be to remove the administrationof Christmas Island from the purview of the elected Government in singapore and to administer it either through the Government of anotherColonial territory or direct through the Governor of Singapore.7.     The objection to adopting the first course is that it is not possibleto foretell what form our reserved powers will take under any newconstitution.    There is also the possibility that if there were somequestion affecting Christmas Island which made it necessary to use those powers we would have to consider whether the need was such as tojustify the constitutional crisis which their use might well provoke.For these reasons therefore any assurances that we gave to the australians would have to be so qualified that it is doubtful whetherthey would be satisfied by thern: in particular they might not feel their economic interests could be safeguarded by reserved powers whichmight well be restricted to the field of defence.8.     As has been explained above, there is no intrinsic reason why weshould not adopt the second course of removing the administration of the island from the purview of the Singapore Government and there are soundreasons for keeping the control of the Island in our hands or for transferring it to Australia on whom we can rely for co-operation in thedefence of the area.    There are, however, certain difficulties in theway of this course and before it is adopted it is necessary to consider(a) the timing of any such move, (b) the question of what compensation should be paid to the Government of Singapore for the loss of revenue to them resulting from it and (c) through what agency the Island shouldbe administered in future.9.     The Governor of Singapore considers that the timing of any transfer would be very important and is of the opinion that the transfershould take place before or as soon as any new constitution is introduced.    (It appears not unlikely that there will be a further conference early next year with a delegation from Singapore in orderto seek agreement to a new constitution.)   In my view the Governor&apos;advice is sound because, unless the opportunity is taken to transfer responsibility for the Island at the time when a new constitution is introduced, it will be politically very difficult if not impossible to securethe agreement of the new Singapore Government to such a transfer ata later date.    There would be political objections in Singapore to sucha move not only because of the loss of revenue involved but also becausesuch a transfer would be regarded by the Singapore Government as a diminution of its own rights and authority.    It should, however, not
be impossible in constitutional negotiations to secure agreement to thetransfer of the Island at the time of an introduction of a new constitution,subject to the payment of compensation for loss of revenue, if the groundis carefully prepared beforehand.10.    At present the Government of Singapore receive about  130,000 ayear from Christmas Island in the form of royalties from the working ofphosphate deposits, together with some revenue from income tax.    In1808, it was annexed to the United Kingdom and placed under the jurisdiction of the Government of the Straits Settlements (which included Singapore).Since 1946 it has been administered by the separate Government of theColony of Singapore.    It might well therefore be held that the Singapore government can count itself fortunate to have hitherto enjoyed the revenuesfrom Christmas Island, a United Kingdom possession which the UnitedKingdom Government has chosen solely for reasons of convenience to administer through the Government of Singapore, and that they have novalid claim for compensation for the loss of revenue to which they haveno inherent right.   But it is certain that the Singapore Government would demand a handsome compensation for the loss of revenue as a conditionto agreeing to the transfer of the Island.    The Governor has expressedthe preliminary view that the Singapore Government could argue thatthe transfer called for compensation to the tune of a cash payment of atleast seven or eight million pounds on the sole basis of lost potentialrevenues.    This would be a matter for negotiation with the Singapore government, but it is certain that some financial arrangements will haveto be made if the Island is to be transferred to another administration.There are various possible ways, which will have to be exploredfurther, of compensating Singapore if this proved to be essentialpolitically;  a likely method would be to undertake that the net revenues of the Island be paid until such time as the phosphates run out and subjectto all reasonable costs of administration - both concurrently and withrespect to the future.    This latter aspect of the question will have to beconsidered further in the interests of the inhabitants.11,     Finally it will be necessary to consider to whom the administra-tion of the Island should be transferred if it is removed from the purview of the Singapore Government.    Difficulties of communications make itimpracticable to transfer the Island to the administration of one of theColonial Governments in Borneo.    There remains, however, thepossibility of placing it under the direct administration of the governor of Singapore (or High Commissioner, as he will probably become underthe new constitution) and removing it from the authority of SingaporeMinisters.    Although such a course would not escape public attention,either in the United Kingdom or Singapore, because it would require a united Kingdom Order in Council, this transfer would not be open to allthe objections and unfavourable criticism which would attend a transferof the Island to Australia or even the transfer of its administration toanother Colonial Government.    It would also pave the way to a possible future transfer of the administration of the Island to Australia at a convenient date, at which time the Australians could be asked toreimburse any United Kingdom expenditure.12.    To sum up, I consider that, in view of the undoubted economicand strategic importance of Christmas Island to Australia, its administra-tion should be removed from that of the Government of Singapore beforeSingapore obtains full internal self-government.    There are no intrinsicreasons of history, race or geographical affinity why this course shouldnot be pursued.    I do not consider that it would be possible to guarantee
to safeguard Australian interests in Christmas Island after the achieve-ment of full internal self-government by Singapore through the use ofsuch reserved powers as will still be retained by the United Kingdom.In view of Australia&apos;s preponderant interest in the Island and of the inconvenience of continuing its direct administration by the UnitedKingdom Government, I consider that the long-term aim should be totransfer its administration to the Government of Australia.    K, however,it is not possible to do this now for political reasons, I suggest that the island should be transferred to the direct administration of the governor of Singapore acting as the representative of the United Kingdom Govern-ment, and that this should be done when the new constitution is introduced.This course would probably arouse less local political objection than would be provoked by the transfer of the administration of the Island tosome authority outside Singapore and would also simplify the eventual nextstep of transferring the Island to Australia.    In the meanwhile it would bepossible once the Island has been transferred from the authority of the singapore Council of Ministers, adequately to safeguard Australianinterests there.    If this is agreed, it will then be necessary, afterconsultation with the Governor of Singapore who will be directly concernedin the new arrangements, to inform the Australian Government in confidence of what we propose to do.    We shall also have to keep theNew Zealand Government informed of developments, because they have an interest in the phosphate deposits on the Island.13.    This paper has been prepared in consultation with the commonwealth secretary, who is in agreement with it.    I invite my colleagues&apos; viewson the course which we propose should be pursued.A.L. -B.Colonial Office, S.W.I.31st July, 1956.
Text of a message elated 21st March from Mr. Menziesto the Prime Minister, delivered by Sir Thomas Whiteto Lord Home on 22nd March.When I was in London in February 1S55 I spokeinformally to Swinton and Lennox-Boyd about our interest in transfer of Christinas Island toAustralian Administration.   Casey informs me thathe again raised question in &quot;September, 1955, in histalks with Lennox-Boyd who suggested matter shouldbe raised formally with you.2.    You will be aware of our concern which Iunderstand you share about uncertainty which existsconcerning future political developments in Singapore.There seems to us to be an evident possibility thatSingapore may fall under control of a Governmentwhich may decline to recognise Australian-importantdefence and economic interests in Christmas Island.These interests are referred to below.3.    From defence point of view Island has become of strategic importance because(I)   It is unlikely that Indonesian airfields willbe available in war.   An airstrip with appropriate facilities on Christmas Islandwould provide(A) A valuable fighter reinforcement routebetween Australia and Singapore orMalaya - first stage of route throughCoeds Island is beyond safe range of fighter aircraft.   The alternativeroute is through Netherlands Mew Guineaand Philippines.(B) A staging point for transport aircraft -route to Singapore is shorter than thatthrough CocoSo(C) An alternative to Cocos airstrip.(D) A maritime air base.(E) Facilities for protection for phospatev/orks and associated shipping,(F) A base for offensive operations.
(II)   Christmas Island lies generally along lineof prolongation of Australian rocket missilesrange and could assume defence importance incontext of long range weapons testing and research.4.    With regard to phosphate supplies British PhosphateCommission has right&quot; to exploit Islands phosphatedeposits under a lease which expires in 1989^   Asatisfactory royalty arrangement has been negotiatedcovering next ensuing 5 years.   Christmas Island atpresent provides approximately one quarter of australian phosphate requirements and plans are inhand for a substantial increase in production.   these supplies are essential for maintenance of Australianagricultural effort,5.    Christmas Island is administered as part ofColony of Singapore and I recognise that it isprobable that any move to transfer Island toAustralia would encounter resistance in Singapore.If you feel in these circumstances that United KingdomGovernment could not consider the transfer of sovereignty to Australia at present time australian and United Kingdom interests could be met if itjverefound practicable for United Kingdom to detach islandfrom Colony of Singapore and administer it as aseparate United Kingdom dependency.   In,this eventI would hope that this action would not prejudicepossibility of a further Australian approach for adminsitrative control of Island at some time infuture if circumstance appeared favourable for sucha development and that way would be open in any case for establishment and use of an airstrip and other facilities for use by Australia if and when these were required.6.    You will understand urgency of this matter.   Iwould be grateful for an expression of your views on alternative course which I have suggested abovenamely(1)   Transfer of sovereignty over Christmas island to Australia or(2)   To detach administration of Christmas Islandfrom Colony of Singapore and administer itas a separate United Kingdom dependency.7.    You will no doubt agree that it would be undesirable that our discussions of these considerations should be made known to political authorities in singapore and I am sure you will see therefore thatthey are in no way referred to them.
Christmas Island (Indian Ocean)The Island was first discovered in 1643, butremained uninhabited and unowned until 1888, when a small settlement was established from theCocos/Keeling Islands under Andrew Clunies-Ross,In the same year, following the discovery bySir James Murray of workable phosphate deposits,it was annexed to the United Kingdom, and placed under the administration of the Government of theStraits Settlements;   since 1946, it has been held as part of the separate Colony of Singapore.In 1896, a lease to work the phosphate depositswas given jointly to Clunies-Ross and Murray, who inthe following year formed the Christmas IslandPhosphate Company, and introduced Chinese labourersto the island mainly from Malaya and Singapore.   the christmas Island Phosphate Company was acquired in1949 by the Governments of Australia and Mew Zealand,on whose behalf the Christmas Island PhosphateCommission was formed.   Approximately 235,000 tons are produced annually, and&quot;because of the short seahaul nearly all of this is exported to Australia,fulfilling rather more than one third of thatcountry&apos;s total phosphate requirements;   little, ifany, goes to New Zealand, but the satisfaction ofpart of Australia&apos;s needs from Christmas Islandbenefits New Zealand by making available for her alarger part of the phosphate exports from Nauru andOcean Island,   Under a recently negotiated agreement,the Government of Singapore received royalties fromthe working of the phosphate deposits, and these,together with some revenue from income tax, amountto approximately  130,000 a year,   A very simpleform of administration under a District officer is maintained on the island, together with asmall weather reporting station.   The presentpopulation, 80 per cent of whom are Chinese,number about 2,000, and depend for their livelihoodentirely upon the phosphate industry.
