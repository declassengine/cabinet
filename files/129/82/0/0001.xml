THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1956SECRET Copy No.CP. (56) 15122nd June, 1956IICABINETUNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service and theMinister of Pensions and National InsuranceA Committee of officials was appointed (CM. (56) 35th Conclusions.Minute 5): &quot; To promote and co-ordinate any action which may be necessary or desirable for the Government to take in regard to automation and the developmentsto which it may give rise.&quot;2. The Committee have now made a Report, which we circulate herewith,on:  (a) The possibility of improving the unemployment benefit provision for workers made redundant in their employment by automation.(b) The general rules governing the payment of unemployment benefit to workers on short time, whether arising from automation or not.On the second subject the Committee suggest a change which might require legis-lation and we therefore discuss this first.Short-time Working3. A worker who is on short time or whose work is temporarily suspendedcannot be treated as unemployed on any day on which he works or for which he receives payment from his employer. Recent rulings of the National InsuranceCommissioner have, however, made it clear that a guaranteed week agreement neednot imply payment by the employer for each day of the week and, for days on which no work is done and no payment is made; claims for benefit can be made underthe same rules as apply to the man who is without an employer and seeking a newjob. After three waiting days, benefit is payable for any two days of unemploymentin six consecutive weekdays, so that as the rules stand benefit (and two days at that)is payable to a worker who has earnings for four full days&apos; employment in a week,even though he may normally work only one day more. This situation has attracted much criticism where the worker&apos;s earnings are still high by ordinarystandards, and is unsatisfactory both from the insurance point of view and in its effect on the mobility of labour.4. From the insurance point of view it was never intended that benefit shouldbe paid where only one day&apos;s work a week has been lost, but this principle hasbeen increasingly undermined by the adoption of the 5-day week in industry. the availability for other employment of such workers is difficult to test effectively andmany people think it wrong that short-time workers with high earnings shouldhave them subsidised out of the contributions of workers whose full-time earnings are lower. On the other hand, there seems to have been no criticism of the paymentof benefit in the cotton industry, where wages are low, to short-time workers whohave equally lost only one day&apos;s earnings, and it would seem very questionablepolicy to make insurance benefits less available to those with high earning power.5. As regards labour mobility, in some industries, particularly motor-cars,the effect of the Governments economic measures has shown itself so far in50071
short-time working rather than the discharge of workers. The ability to supplement earnings with benefit is not of course the only reason causing workers to prefer short-time working rather than seek fresh employment, particularly whenthey are employed in firms or industries where their earnings are relatively high.But to make an insurance change primarily in order to increase the mobility oflabour would clearly lay the Government open to political attack on the groundthat it was indifferent to the interests of the workers and determined to createunemployment. It would seem therefore that the justification for any furtherrestriction on the insurance benefits of short-time workers would have to be onwider grounds of general equity.6. After considering various possibilities the Committee of officials have recommended that the method of dealing with the situation which would cause the least difficulty would be to treat Saturday as a day in respect of whichunemployment benefit is not payable. The rule would then be that benefit couldonly be paid if the worker were unemployed in a week on two days other thanSaturday and Sunday. For the days of unemployment which counted, benefit would then be paid at one-fifth (instead of one-sixth) of the weekly rate. A variantof this proposal would be to eliminate the first day of proved unemployment inany calendar week and pay one-fifth of the weekly rate for each of the remainingdays if in excess of one. While this would avoid the suggestion that Saturday isto be regarded as a non-working day, it would be more difficult to administer. Theintention of either change would be to limit the payment of benefit duringshort-time working to those cases in which the worker was not working more than three days a week. The result would, in our view, be to limit considerably theextent to which workers on short time would receive benefit. Assuming the present level and pattern of short-time working, such a change might save the national insurance Fund perhaps  2 million a year, though too much importance should.&apos; not, owing to the uncertainty of the situation, be attached to this figure.7. Either of the general changes suggested would require legislation andwe should mention that an automatic effect of the adoption of a five-day benefitweek (unless countervailing action was taken) would be to increase by one-fifththe present periods, from 30 weeks upwards, for which unemployment benefitcan be drawn. Either change would also have to apply to sickness benefit because,for various purposes of the insurance scheme, days of sickness and days ofunemployment are interchangeable. The practical effect in relation to sickness benefit would, however, be quite small.8. An alternative to a general change in the benefit rules would be to make special conditions for five-day-week workers on short time. This could be effected by regulations. Any such regulations would, however, have to be submitted indraft to the National Insurance Advisory Committee and, as they would be obligedto consider representations on the subject, it would probably be three to six months before they were able to report.9. It is important in this connection to note that in a report last autumn theNational Insurance Advisory Committee, while recognising the present anomalies,expressly recommended that no change should be made in the arrangementsrelating to short-time working. The likely attitude of the Committee to draft regulations on these lines might therefore not be altogether favourable.10. While there is undoubtedly public uneasiness about the payment ofbenefit to some short-time workers, we do not consider that a sufficiently strong and clear case exists for action to change the insurance rules at present. A furtherreason for delay is that the decisions so far given by the National InsuranceCommissioner on guaranteed week agreements only relate to those of individual firms in the engineering industry. The proper interpretation of the main agreementcovering some 2\ million workers in federated firms arises on an appeal whichwill shortly be coming before him. The amount of short time being worked isnot increasing. We would therefore propose to keep^ the subject under review and, if in the autumn it still seemed desirable that some change should be made,it might perhaps be undertaken in a less controversial atmosphere in conjunctionwith other changes in the insurance scheme, which may in any case have to bethe subject of legislation next Session. We might in this way also expect to getthe benefit of some exchange of views on the subject with representatives ofemployers and trade unions.
Position of Discharged Workers11. The introduction of automation may lead to the discharge of workers on redundancy and the Committee of officials accordingly considered thepossibility of improving the present rate of benefit to help meet this situation.They point out, however, that automation is only one possible cause of redundancy(and in present circumstances we think a less likely one than some others) andthat any adjustment in the benefit rates would have to apply to all unemployed workers. Secondly, they take the view that any improvement in the general rules of unemployment benefit could only be considered along with the rates of national insurance pensions and benefits generally, and also of war pensions. We agreewith the officials on both points and also share their view that no practicableimprovement in benefit rates would significantly weaken the resistance of workers to losing their employment.12. The report points out, however, that where a worker&apos;s employment hasbeen finally terminated, he is not prevented from getting benefit by the fact that heis also getting compensation from his former employer for the loss of his formerremuneration, so long as the compensation, together with his own benefit (ignoringany payments for dependants), does not exceed two-thirds of his previousremuneration. We think it desirable that this arrangement should be more widely known so that, where an employer wishes to compensate a worker who is beingdischarged after long satisfactory service, he should not be discouraged fromassisting the worker&apos;s resettlement by the belief that it would prevent the paymentof benefit.13.  We therefore recommend that-(1) no immediate action should be taken to restrict the right to benefit of short-time workers but the subject should be kept under review as setout in paragraph 10, and the whole subject looked at again in theautumn;(2) on the possibility of improving the rate of unemployment benefit, the viewsset out in paragraph 11 should be accepted;(3) the fact that employers are not prevented from supplementing the benefits of discharged workers should be made more widely known.I. M.J. A. B.-C.2.1st June, 1956.
OFFICIAL COMMITTEE ON AUTOMATIONREPORT ON UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITSUMMARY OF report,   Workers who have &quot;been discharged and are compelled to seek fresh employment are normally entitled to unemploymentbenefit.      This benefit may be drawn &quot;by workers who are receiving compensation payments from their late employersprovided that these payments do not exceed certain limits.The provision.for supplementation of benefit by employers fortheir former workers is reasonable where employment has been finally terminated and therefore we do not suggest any changein these arrangements,2.    Under present arrangements, supplementation of benefit by employers is not permitted where workers are on short time or are temporarily suspended.      We accept the view that employers should not be encouraged to retain workers who aretemporarily under-employed at the expense of the national insurance Fund and accordingly recommend that the existing arrangements should be endorsed,3.    Unemployment benefit has always been available to personswho are temporarily under-employed, provided that they are willing to work elsewhere on the days when their regularemployer cannet use them and subject to the normal tests forreceipt of unemployment benefit.     Where guaranteed weekagreements provide for no- more than four days pay, benefit maybe payable for the two days of the week on which no work is done - even where the worker is on a five day week.      this gives rise to two serious anomalies:(a) Two days benefit can be earned by the loss ofone day&apos;s work;(b) In practice, the statutory test.of availability for employment cannot be effectively applied.k-   We have considered various methods of remedying thisunfortunate situation:(i)   By providing (by regulation) that benefit should notbe paid where a guaranteed week was in operation;(ii)   By introducing an earnings rule which would preventbenefit being paid in any week to any one withcomparatively high earnings in that week;(iii) By altering the conditions for receipt of benefit sothat no more than one day&apos;s benefit could be paid toa five day week worker who has lost one day&apos;s work.5.   All these proposals would give rise to administrative difficulties and would probably lead to new anomalies withoutdealing effectively with the problem of the payment of benefitto workers on short time      Moreover, (i) would be represented as an attack on the guaranteed wage principle and (ii) wouldbe attacked as a means test.6.    We have therefore suggested that the problem could best be tackled by excluding Saturday for benefit purposes in the same way as Sunday is now excluded.     Benefit v/ould then be payable for the five remaining days of the week at one-fifth of the weekly rate;   consequential adjustments of the conditions wouldbe required.     The change proposed would exclude from benefitall short time workers now entitled to pay from their employers for four working days.     Legislation would be necessary,7.    Details are given in the Report below,
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT1.     Our terms of reference have led us to consider speciallythe provision, &quot;by way of unemployment benefit or otherwise,of compensation payments to workers displaced by automation,and also the general rules governing the receipt ofunemployment benefit by workers on short time.Displaced Workers, compelled to seek fresh employmentCompensation payments by former employer2.     A worker who has been discharged by his employer onredundancy and compelled to seek fresh employment, will normally be entitled to unemployment benefit at the rate ofl+Os. single, 65s. married, with additional payments fordependent children.     He can at the same time be in receiptof periodic compensation payments from his previous employer,provided such payments do not exceed two-thirds of the remuneration lost less the single pers/n&apos;s rate of benefit(l+Os.).     The fact that it is permissible for benefit&apos;to &quot;bepaid concurrently with compensation payments in this way isnot perhaps so widely understood as it might be.     Thepresent rules were endorsed by the National InsuranceAdvisory Committee in 135k, when the regulations were slightlyvaried from those previously in force in order to fit theprovision made for workers displaced in consequence of theTransport Act, 1953.     They, also fit agreements, which havestatutory Ministerial approval, arrived at for payments tocolliery workers who become redundant as a result of majorreorganisations, and we understand that similar arrangementsfor cushioning redundance discharges have been in operation for a considerable time in certain ather industries.3.     Where workers who have given satisfactory service over asubstantial period are discharged because of reorganisationvoluntarily undertaken by the employer in order to make his business more profitable, there would seem to be both amoral obligation on the employer and also the means available,for him to make compensation payments additional to national insurance benefit to assist the smoother resettlement of theworkers in fresh employment, and we understand that suchprevisions (often called &quot;severance monejr&quot;) and also in somecases assistance in other directions, such as removalexpenses, have been fairly widely adopted in the U.S.A. andin other countries.     In this county the Government can hardly discourage similar action in view of what has already&quot;Ween done for workers displaced not only under the transport act, 1953, but under the various nationalisation   statutesincluding the provision for colliery workers already mentioned.It does not, however, seem to us that any case can be made out for making better provision from insurance or other public funds for workers displaced by automation or other forms of technological change, than arises where a workerwith equally long and satisfactory service loses his jobbecause his employer&apos;s activities have contracted, or, in extreme cases, the employer has been forced out of business.Indeed, it could be argued that the latter case is moredeserving of sympathetic State action because the employer is then much less likely to have the financial resources withwhich to assist his displaced workers.     Where employment has been finally terminated, therefore we see no objectionto employers arranging to supplement the unemployment benefitof their former workers to the extent allowed by the present regulations, which seem to us to impose a limit which is .reasonable in itself and also acceptable to trade unionopinion.
Rate of Unemployment BenefitU.     We have also considered whether it would assist in meeting any redundancy problems likely to be thrown up ty the spread of automation if the present rates of unemploymentbenefit could be increased.     We do not see how the rates ofthis benefit, provided as it is from funds to which allcontribute equally, could be varied according to the particulareconomic circumstances which led to the worker losing his employer or according to his -previous earnings.     any increase in the rate of unemployment alone would not be politically possible.     But a general increase in thestandard rate of   benefit, including retirement pension,would be a very costly operation which, in view of the needfor stringent economjr in Government expenditure, could not becontemplated at present.     Even a minimum increase of 5s.on the standard rate - together with the inevitableconsequential improvement in war pension rates - would impose an additional charge of the order of  20 millions on the Exchequer in the first full year.     The immediate increase in expenditure from the National Insurance fund would be about  80 millions but this would rise steadilythereby adding to the deficits which will have to be met by theExchequer in future years.       Increased benefits would haveto be   accompanied by increased contributions and these would add to the pressure on wage rates.     An increase of5s. on a weekly rate of UOs. would still leave the rate ofunemployment benefit far below the average earnings of men.As regards the likely effect on the attitude.of the redundant worker, a high rate of unemployment benefit mightbe disadvantageous in that, &quot;by making short time workingmore attractive to the workers, employers would be underincreased pressure to retain redundant staff.     But otherwise,the rate of State unemployment benefit available does not seemto us likely to have much effect on the worker&apos;s willingness to accept displacement from his employment by automation orother technological change.    If his unemplos/rnent is likely tobe prolonged the worker will do everything he can to resi,:tthe changes which would bring it about whatever the rateof the unemployment benefit.     If (as in present circumstancesmust nearly always be the case)he can expect to be offeredfull time employment elsew/here very quickly, his attitudetowards displacement will not be determined by the rate ofbenefit payable during the interval but b2r the prospectsoffered in the new employment as compared with the old, anydisturbance costs involved, and, where a change of home is involved, housing,  educational and other family problems.Pension schemes for manual workers supplementing the national insurance provision have become    widespread, and any loss ofpension rights which cannot be made good in the new employmentmay also have an important effect on the worker&apos;s attitude.Workers on short.....time or.....temporarily suspended.Supplementation.....of benefit by employers.     Except in the case where employment has been finallyterminated, there is no provision allowing employers to supplement any unemployment benefit to which their workers are entitled during short time or suspension.   As benefit is payable on a daily basis, it is however possible foran employer to be making payments in respect of certain days
in a week, whether work is done on them or not, while benefit is payable for others.     The rules have not always been sorestrictive.     Between 1939 and I9U8 there was statutory provision for Ministerial approval for supplementation ofbenefit by employers, of which advantage was taken by the flour-milling industry and the Unilever group.     The national insurance Advisory Committee was specially asked in 19^7 toconsider whether corresponding provision should be made by regulations under the National Insurance Act, 19M5.     after hearing the arguments of those who had taken advantage of theold provision and those who wished to do so, the committee recommended against any such provision being made, and their advice was accepted.     The relevant part of their report (whichwas published and laid before Parliament (H. of C. No.161 of?: 19^6)is reproduced as an Appendix.     It will be seen that theCommittee took the view that in post-war conditions it was wrong to use national insurance funds to help&apos; employers toretain workers to whom they were unable to offer work.Apart from the economic arguments against encouraging under-employment, the Committee drew attention to the fact that alarge section of the insured population and their employers would, because of the terms of their employment, be unable totake advantage of such arrangements if permitted, and pointedout that in some cases the bar was statutory, e.g. in thecase of workers covered by the Dock Workers (Regulation ofEmployment) Act, I9L1.6, or by the Agricultural Wages Acts.6,     We find the arguments used by the National InsuranceAdvisory Committee in 1 9U8 still convincing, and we would add that it might be thought particularly unfair by otherinsured workers and their employers if an exception to thegeneral rule were made in favour of concerns whose workers were temporarily under-employed during the introduction ofprocesses designed to make the concern more profitable.   Wethink particular attention should be drawn to the positionin the port transport industry since, it if were now decidedto revert to the unemployment insurance position which obtained between 1939 and 19U8, an unanswerable case couldbe made for a revision of the Dock Workers (Regulation ofSmployment) Act arrangements to permit the payment of benefit(or sums in lieu) to disengaged dockers in relief of thepresent &quot;fall back&quot; guarantee payments now made out of the proceeds of a general levy on port transport employers.     ACommittee is at present examining the working of these arrangements.
Benefit during short time workingHistorical and General7.   Unemployemnt insurance has always catered, not only for thewholly unemployed seeking fresh employment, hut for those whoare temporarily under-employed, provided they are willing towork elsewhere on the days when their regular employer cannotemploy them, and subject to rules which normally prevent thepayment of benefit for the first three days of unemployment(the &quot;waiting days&quot;) and for isolated days which do not satisfy the &quot;continuity11 rule.     Down to 1940 the continuityrule prevented the payment of benefit unless there were atleast three days of unemployment in any six consecutive days(excluding Sunday which is disregarded for all purposes).The daily rate is one-sixth of the weekly rate.     Since 1940only two days of unemployment in any six have been requiredto enable benefit to be paid for them, and with the spread ofthe five day week in those manufacturing industries whereshort time working is most often resorted to, it has become&apos;common for workers who have lost only one day&apos;s work not onlyto get benefit but to get it for two days, since Saturday canthen be claimed as a day of unemployment.     In the case of themore highly paid workers (and the earnings of some of thoserecently on short time have b-een bigger than those of manyfull time workers) the exception of unemployment benefit from income tax is an added attraction.8.    It was at one time thought that the guaranteed weekagreements which have been widely adopted in manufacturing industries since the war, would preclude the payment of benefitto Workers covered by them on the ground that the guaranteemust be regarded as a payment by the employer for each day ofthe week.     But where the guarantee is for no more than four days, which is the commonest form, it has been found possibleto draw the agreements in such a way that they do not preventclaims for be.uej.it for two days of the week on which no work is done.9.    The situation which has resulted from the interaction ofthese factors - whereby a tax free benefit is payable inaddition to comparatively high wages earned for a short week -is economically indefensible.    In conditions of full employment and shortage of labour the availability of benefit in thesecircumstances is an inducement to firms which have achievedimprovements in productivity to hoard labour by working short time. &apos;This nullifies the benefits which the economy as awhole should derive from industrial prosperity by keeping upcosts which should be reduced and by withholding much neededrelief to the general scarcity of labour.   Moreover, the pressure for mild short time working usually comes from theworkers who are not worried by it so long as benefit is available.10.   Nor is the position satisfactory from the insurance pointof view.   The .availability for employment of a worker who has lost at most one day&apos;s pay through short time working must besuspect but cannot usually be effectively tested;    and, unlesshis normal wage is low, he can rarely be offered full timeemployment elsewhere which he will   not have acceptablereasons for refusing.    Nor does it seem consistent with the&quot;two-in-aix&quot; rule or with the limitation on benefit payments tounemployed workers in receipt of compensation from their formeremployers (see paragraph 2 above), that a worker should getbenefit at all, still less for two days, when he has only lostone day&apos;s work and is earning 80 per cent of his normal wage.
11.   While the payment of benefit during recent short time working in high wage industries has attracted a good dealof public criticism, there would certainly be strongresistance from the trade unions and also from some of theemployers concerned if it were proposed to alter to the disadvantage of short time workers the conditions on whichunemployment benefit can be paid.   Because of difficulties arising out of earlier short time working, the national insurance Advisory&apos; Committee were asked in 1953 to review the whole question of the payment of benefit for very shortspells of sickness or unemployment.   They went into thequestion very fully but were unable to arrive at any agreed solution of the difficulties, and their Report, whilefrankly admitting the anomalies, accordingly made no recommendation for changes   The Report was published as a command Paper in November, 1953, (Gmd. 9609) without any indication whether the Government accepted the Committee^conclusions.12.   We have, as directed, nevertheless reviewed the whole position again in the light of the experience gained during recent short time working.   We have not limited ourselves tothe suggestions examined in the Advisory Committee^ Report.Guaranteed Week Agreements13.   Following decisions recently given by the national insurance Commissioner, there is nothing to prevent anyguaranteed week agreements being re-worded, where thishas not already happened, so as to ensure that where theguarantee is for no more than four day!s pay, two day&apos;benefit can be drawn if four days   or less are being worked.A regulation could probably be framed to prevent the paymentof benefit where a guaranteed week was in operation, but itcould be represented as an attack on the guaranteed wageprinciple and we doubt whether it would be effective or -free from anomalies in limiting the payment of benefit toshort time workers?   Our doubts arise because the agreementscan usually be suspended at short notice on a variety ofgrounds and because in any firm on short time there arealways some workers not covered by the guarantee, e,g. becauseof short service, who would then be free to claim benefitwhile earning as much as those prevented from claimingby their guarantee.An Earnings Rule1U.   The Royal Commission on Unemployment Insurance which reported in 1932, recommended that the payment of benefitto short time and casual workers should be limited by on earnings rule which would prevent benefit being paid in any.week to any one with comparatively high earnings in that week, irrespective of the proportion which those earningsbore to the normal wage.   The recommendation was notimplemented.   The idea behind this approach was, to limitpayments to those whose total income from earnings and benefit was such that they could be said to be sufferinghardship and who could therefore be presumed to be willingto accept other more regular employment.   An earnings rule of this kind would meet those critics of the payment ofbenefit during recent short time working who consider that unemployment benefit should not be paid to people whose ,earnings are high in relation to those of many full timeworkers who, through their contributions, are meeting thecost of the benefit.   An earnings rule also has certain
attractions from the point of view of securing fairness,both as between different classes of claimants and asbetween claimants and contributors but it seems open to thefollowing objections -(1)   Although, as the Royal Commission explained, anearnings rule would be no more than a measure ofemployment, which is obviously relevant to a claim for unemployment benefit, the proposal would doubtless be attacked as a means test.(2)   Unless the rule was so severe as to exclude manyclaims which can now be made, there would be much extrawork for Employment Exchanges and for employers inascertaining the claimantfs earnings week by week andthere might well be delays in payment benefit.(3)    In selecting a suitable base for adjustingbenefit to earnings there would be the same difficulties as now arise in connection with the earnings rule   for retirement pensions, from the disparity of men&apos;s andwomen&apos;s earnings.(k)    As the amount of benefit would be related to total earnings week by week, it might be difficult to resist claims for supplementation of low weekly earnings where no claim for unemployment   benefit couldsucceed under the present rules.(5)    It might be difficult to defend an earnings rulefor unemployment bonefitwithout admitting the validity of an earnings rule for sickness benefit, yet thiswould encounter the fiercest opposition.   Nearly50 per cent of new claims for sickness benefit are. made by people who are also receiving payments fromtheir employers.Changing the Continuity Rule&quot;15.    It might be possible to frame a regulation which would prevent the payment of more than one day&apos;s benefit to a five day week worker who has lost only one day&apos;s work, butthis would still leave serious anomalies between thetreatment of five day and six day week workers, and betweenfive day week workers who lost one day&apos;s work and those wholost more.   The most&apos; serious objection to such a change is,however, that it would seem to establish the principle thatbenefit should be paid generally for single days ofunemployment.   Further, while irritating the workersaffected, the change would not satisfy those who criticiseHM. payment of benefit where only one day&apos;s work has been lost.16.   We consider that if a change is to be made, it should go further and.seek to increase the proportion of 0 normalweek&apos;s work which must be lost before any benefit can be paid and thereby get to a position in which the short time workercan only qualify for benefit in circumstances where it can
reasonably bs supposed that if the short time continued forlong, he would be prepared to move to full time employmentelsewhere.   Any diminution of existing benefit rights would of course be opposed but the effect of criticism would be weakened if the new rule could be defended -(a) as no more than the development of the principlesof the present rule to meet changing industrial conditions;(b) as being in line with the established rule whichregulates the payment of benefit with compensation from a previous employer, explained in paragraph 2.A New Proposal17*   The best proposal we are able to make is that Saturdayshould in future be treated for benefit purposes generally inthe same way as Sunday now is, that is excluded from reckoningaltogether,,   Benefit would then be payable for the fiveremaining days of the week at one-fifth of the weekly rate,subject to the continuity rule which would be altered inconformity with the new situation to secure that benefit wasnot paid unless there were two or more days of unemploymentin any five days (excluding Saturday and Sunday).Legislation would be necessary.   We understand that theNational Insurance Advisory Committee looked at, but didnot pursue, this possibility because they thought theGovernment would not wish to appear to be endorsing thefive day week for general adoption;    the&apos;fact that theCivil Service is now to be put on a five day basis wouldseem to have weakened the force of such an objection.&quot;18.   The rule put forward would effectively exclude frombenefit all short time workers now entitled to pay fromtheir employers for four working days, thereby substantiallyremoving the unfairnesses as between five day and six day week workers and those arising from guaranteed wage agree-ments, to which the Advisory Committee drew attention in.their Report,    An incidental advantage would be to relievepressure on Employment Exchanges, and, if the rule alsoapplied to sickness benefit, on National Insurance offices and on general practitioners on Saturdays.   Even for the six day a week worker, inability to work on his Saturdayhalf-day could hardly nowadays be regarded as a matterrequiring compensation from the National Insurance Fund.
APPENDIXSupplementation of Unemployment BenefitExtract from the N.I.A.C. Report on the draft Unemployment and sickness Benefit Regulations, 1948*&quot;Our attention was drawn &quot;by the Ministry of national insurance to the omission from these regulations of any provision similar to that contained in the Approval ofArrangements Regulations, 19I+O, made under section 2 of theUnemployment Insurance Act, 1939, enabling arrangements to he made, subject to the approval of the Minister, for thesupplementation by employers of unemployment benefit during periods when a worker&apos;s employment is suspended or terminated.There is no provision in the National Insurance Act, 1946,corresponding to section 2 of the Unemployment Insurance Act,1939* but there.is power under section 11(3) of the 1946 Actto make regulations defining what can or cannot be treated asa day of unemployment which could be used to achieve a similareffect.A number of firms or industries especially concerned inthis question, either because they had such arrangements inforce, or because they were seeking or known to be seeking approval of such arrangements, were informed by the Ministryof this omission from the regulations and of their right tomake representations to us on the question.   As a result all those so notified did make representations to us urging, inevery case, that provision should be made enabling approvedarrangements of the same kind to be made in the new scheme ofnational insurance.    Almost the whole of the oral evidence which we received on the provisions of these regulations was directed to supporting this request.The conditions under which in accordance with the Approvalof Arrangements Regulations, 1940, such arrangements may atpresent be approved are:-(a) the workers must be free to accept alternative employment, and the employer must not be in a positionto require the workers to resume employment with himunless they are unemployed at the time of the offer;(b) the payments plus benefit receivable must not, exceptfor 13 weeks in the year, exceed three quarters ofthe normal wage;    and(c) the conditions of the Minister&apos;s approval must be notified to the workers in a way approved by theMinister.The condition that the worker must be free to acceptalternative employment has, in the arrangements made, usually  ...been imposed in the form that supplementary payments are made only so long as the worker registers&apos; at the employment exchange, is available for work, and does not unreasonablyrefuse an offer of suitable employment.The main reasons advanced by the Ministry for the omissionfrom these regulations of any.provision enabling arrangementsfor the supplementation of unemployment benefit by employers to be approved by the Minister were, briefly, that the continuation and possibly extension of such arrangements would both detract from mobility and the full use of labour and would weaken collective negotiation of guaranteed wage agreementsdesigned to ensure proper wages while employment lasts.
The principal arguments advanced in favour of these arrangements being permitted were, put equally briefly, thatfar, from detracting from the full use of labour the condition that supplementation was payable only so long as an employeemade himself available for and did not unreasonably refuse other work secured that surplus labour was freely available for other work and, on the Ministry&apos;s second point, that the supplementarypayments made under.-these arrangements gave a greater measureof security than was provided under guaranteed week agreements.In one case at least, the arrangements had been made inaddition to a guaranteed week agreement.We recognise that in making arrangements of this kind these industries and firms were indeed progressive in providing ameasure of security for their employees, particularly in those cases where the arrangements were made at times when unemploy-ment was much more widespread than it is to-day and short-time working was more common.    We have felt considerable sympathy with the desire of both the employers and employees concerned to secure that these arrangements are continued.We doubt whether the fact that certain industries or firmspay sums to former employees during period of unemployment doesgreatly affect the availability of these employees for alternative employment during short periods of unemployment.We think that in the main workers, especially workers with some special skill, will always tend to look for work in their usualoccupation and while unemployed to wait for re-employment inthat occupation rather than seek new employment.    This we thinkwill certainly be the case where a period of unemployment isshort, perhaps not more than a few days, and where a workeris aware that his unemployment is due to some temporary cause,for example, weather conditions or shortage of supplies.So far as concerns short-time working of this kind, wetherefore do not think that approved arrangements will detractfrom mobility of labour to any material extent.    There can beno doubt, however, that there has been a general improvementof conditions of employment throughout industry.    employers in some industries, either by statute or by agreement, are nowunder an obligation to guarantee a week&apos;s employment and aminimum wage to all employees retained on their books.    Not onlydoes this act as a discouragement to industries and to employers to retain more workers than necessary but it has the effectthat these employers meet the whole cost of ordinary short-time working arising from temporary industrial conditions.    It istherefore in our view wrong that the Insurance Fund should beused, by means of the approved arrangements which we arediscussing, to subsidise short-time working in other firmswhere the.guaranteed week in one form or another is not inoperation either by agreement or as a result of legislation.Further the fact that the cost of short-time working is not met wholly by the employer where approved arrangements are inoperation may to some extent result in disguising under-employment in these industries or firms.
We consider now the operation of these arrangements duringunemployment of a more enduring nature.    We recognise that where a worker is clearly redundant in his industry or firm,it is during his initial period of unemployment that there isthe best chance of placing him in other employment.    If howevers.during this period a worker receives payments from his formeremployer which continue only while he.is unemployed, this must, we think, lead him to hope and to wait for re-employmentin that occupation and reduce his incentive to seek and acceptalternative employment.    In this way we feel that these arrangements for supplementation of unemployment benefit must,to some extent, operate against the full use of labour.    Inview of the country&apos;s great need for the fullest possible useof labour we are therefore unable to support the case forsupplementation by employers of unemployment benefit duringprolonged periods of unemployment.&quot;
