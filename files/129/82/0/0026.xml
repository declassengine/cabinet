H LOCAL GOVERNMENT ORGANISATION IN ENGLANDAND wales.  THE PRESENT STRUCTUREThe dual systemI. The pattern of local government in England and Wales was established on its present lines by the Local Government Acts of 1888 and 1894. two separate systems were set up one for the county boroughs and another forthe counties. In the county boroughs a single authority was entrusted withthe administration of all local government services in their area. On theother hand, the counties were organised on the so-called &quot; two-tier &quot; system.Under this system the responsibility for some services lies with the countycouncil and for others with the councils of county districts (non-county boroughs, urban districts and rural districts). In rural districts, certain func-tions are performed by parish councils or parish meetings.2. The Act of 1888 established 61 county boroughs and 62 administrativecounties (including the Couniy of London) which is organised somewhatdifferently. Under that Act, the Local Government Board (later the Ministerof Health) was empowered to make Orders, subject to parliamentary con-firmation, conferring county borough status on non-county boroughs withpopulations of not less than 50,000. The Act provided a similar procedure for extending the boundaries of county boroughs. Alternatively, a borough council could seek to achieve either of these objects by promoting a PrivateBill. By 1923, 21 additional county boroughs had been created and manyof the original ones had been enlarged. This involved a considerable transferof population and financial resources from administrative counties to county boroughs.Onslow Commission3. As a result of the First Report of a Royal Commission under thechairmanship of Lord Onslow, the procedure was altered by the LocalGovernment (County Boroughs and Adjustments) Act, 1926. This providedthat thenceforth the creation of new county boroughs could be effected only by Private Act, and that no borough could promote a Bill to achieve countyborough status unless it had a population of at least 75,000. It providedalso that the boundaries of a county borough could be extended by Orderonly where the other local authorities affected did not object to this course ;otherwise the county borough council would have to proceed by PrivateBill.4. In 1926, one new county borough Doncaster was created ; but duringthe following quarter of a century no further applications were made.Between 1949 and 1953 three boroughs Ealing, llford and Luton introducedBills for their promotion to county borough status. They met with strong opposition, particularly from the counties affected ; and none of these Billsreached the Statute Book. Uford, Luton and Poole introduced similar Billsduring the Parliamentary Session of 1954-55, but withdrew them after theMinister of Housing and Local Government had announced that he was considering proposals for the reorganisation of local government.5. Between 1926 and 1939, extensions of county borough boundaries on asubstantial scale were made. This process was discontinued during the war years and during the lifetime of the Local Government Boundary Commission(1945-1949). Thereafter, a number of further extensions have been made,but these have been collectively much smaller than had been asked for by thecounty boroughs in their claims to the Commission.32258
6. Under the Act of 1888, adjustments to the boundaries of urban and rural districts and of parishes could be made on the initiative of countycouncils, as and when they thought fit, the final decision resting with the LocalGovernment Board (later the Minister of Health). However, following theOnslow Commission^ Second Report, the procedure was modified by theLocal Government Act of 1929. This provided that county councils should carry out comprehensive reviews of their areas at specified intervals, andshould recommend to the Minister desirable changes in county districtboundaries.7. The first series of reviews was carried out between 1931 and 1937. Asa result, many authorities were amalgamated and the total number of urban and rural districts was reduced from 1,606 to 1,048. However, numerousvery small authorities still remained.Boundary Commission8. During the war many claims for the creation and extension of county boroughs were held up, and a second series of reviews of county districtshad become due. The problem was discussed by the Government withthe Local Authority Associations; and, following the publication of a white Paper entitled &quot; Local Government in England and Wales during thePeriod of Reconstruction-&quot; (Cmd. 6579), a Local Government Boundary Corn-mission was created by statute in 1945. The Commission was required to review the boundaries, and in certain cases the status, of local authorities.It was given wide powers to make changes, the most important of whichwere subject to confirmation by Parliament.9. After a comprehensive review, the Commission, in its Report for 1947,made proposals for far-reaching changes in the status and functions of localauthorities. However, the Government did not adopt these proposals; and,in 1949, they dissolved the Commission and reinstated, with minor amend-ments, the previous procedure for effecting changes in local government areas.II. VIEWS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIESDivergent opinions10. After the dissolution of the Commission, the question of local govern-ment reform was discussed at joint conferences of four of the Local authority associations, namely the County Councils Association, the Association of municipal Corporations, the Urban District Councils Association and the rural District Councils Association. Later the Association of municipal corporations withdrew, in order to prepare a separate statement of its views ;and the other three Associations were subsequently joined in their discussionsby the National Association of Parish Councils.11. In 1954, the Association of Municipal Corporations, on the one hand,and the other four Associations jointly, on the other, submitted memorandato the Minister of Housing and Local Government, setting out their respec-tive recommendations. These showed a considerable divergence of opinion.The Association of Municipal Corporations favoured the one-tier system ofall-purpose authorities and recommended its extension as far as circum-stances allowed. The other four Associations adopted the opposite approach.They contemplated a reduction in the number of county boroughs and thepossible creation of a two-tier system in the conurbations. The memorandaalso showed differences on other issues, such as the distribution of functions between county councils and district councils.
Discussions with Minister12. In November, 1954, the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentasked representatives of the five Associations to meet him. He told themthat, in his opinion, it would not be fruitful to embark on any extensivereform unless there existed some broad measure of agreement among thelocal authorities themselves. Moreover, he made it clear that he did not con-sider that the existing system of local administration had broken down, andthat he would not be prepared to contemplate eliminating either the two-tier system in the counties or the one-tier system in the big towns. In the lightof this statement, the representatives of the Associations said that they wouldbe sorry to see this question indefinitely shelved, and that, if the minister would take the chair at further meetings, they would like to make a freshattempt to find a basis for agreement within the framework of the existingstructure.Agreed Proposals13. As a result of the series of meetings which followed, the representativesagreed to recommend to their irespective Associations common proposalscovering most of the main issues, including most of those on which theyhad previously been divided. These proposals are set out in full in theAppendix.14. The Government naturally do not take the view that no changes shouldbe proposed to Parliament except with the agreement of the local authorities.Nevertheless, their willing co-operation can be of great value in carrying through any reorganisation. The most careful attention has therefore been paid to the views expressed by the representatives of the Local authority associations. The conclusions reached by the Government upon the broadlines to be followed are set out below.III.  PROPOSALS FOR REORGANISATIONNeed for reorganisation15. The test of any system of local government in this country must be whether it provides a stable structure, capable of discharging efficiently thefunctions entrusted to it, while at the same time maintaining its localdemocratic character.16. Since the present system of local government was established therehave been far-reaching alterations in the distribution of population andindustry, the scope and cost of local services, the speed of communications,and the relationship between central and local government. But it does notnecessarily follow that radical changes in organisation are needed. More-over, the present system is firmly established and the local loyalties and civicpride which have grown up around it are a source&apos; of strength to localgovernment which should not be under-estimated. A fundamental alterationof the existing structure could be justified only if it had shown itself to be incapable of meeting present-day needs. That is not the situation. Thepresent system has, over many years, stood up to the severest tests. Itresponded well to the abnormal demands made on it during the war and,despite certain weaknesses, has on the whole shown itself capable ofadaptation to changing conditions.17. There is, therefore, no convincing case for radically reshaping theexisting form of local government in England and Wales. What is neededis to overhaul it and make such improvements as are necessary to bring it up to date.
18. It was laid down for the Local Government Boundary Commissionin 1945 that the aim of all alterations in the status and boundaries of local  authorities should be &quot; to ensure individually and collectively effective andconvenient units of local government administration&quot;. This broad objective was adopted in the proposals agreed by the representatives of the LocalAuthority Associations and is endorsed by the Government.19. Leaving  aside, functions  and  finance, which can be considered separately, there are five main problems to be examined, namely:creation of new county boroughs;extension of existing county boroughs;revision of county areas ;revision of county district areas; and organisation of the conurbations.But before these and other problems can be tackled, it is necessary to lay down certain guiding principles and provide appropriate machinery to applythem.Procedure for reviews20. The first step is to establish satisfactory methods for determining what changes need to be made. At present there is no means of reviewing theorganisation of local government comprehensively over wide areas. For thecreation of new county boroughs or the extension of existing ones, the onlymachinery available (except where the authorities concerned accept anextension by Order) is the promotion of a Private Bill. But in practice, thishas proved unsatisfactory, costly and often abortive.21. Entirely new procedure is required. This must provide means forstudying problems comprehensively and for assessing the wider repercussions of proposed changes upon other authorities affected. It must enable local circumstances to be investigated and local opinion to be consulted. It must provide independent and informed guidance, while leaving to the Governmentand Parliament responsibility for ultimate decisions.22. As the most effective means of fulfilling these conditions, it is proposedto create two Local Government Commissions, one for England and one for wales. Their main task would be to make recommendations to the minister in regard to the creation and extension of county boroughs, any necessaryalterations in county boundaries, and the organisation of local administration in the conurbations.23. The Commissions&apos; reports and recommendations to the Minister shouldbe published ; and the Minister should submit to Parliament Orders giving effect to them, with any amendments which he might consider desirable.Subject to certain exceptions (see paras. 31 and 36), each Order presented to Parliament should cover a substantial portion of the country, so that a comprehensive assessment can be made of the effects of the changes proposed.24. A serious disadvantage of the existing procedure is the anxiety caused to county councils by the ever-present threat of further losses of territorythrough the, creation or extension of county boroughs ; for even where aPrivate Bill has failed, the fear remains that it may be re-introduced in a subsequent session. This puts a strain on good relations between theauthorities concerned and does not make, for smooth administration. It is accordingly proposed that, after the issues in a particular area have been
settled, there should (apart from reviews of county districts) be a standstillfor a period of years, during which no further changes would normally he made.*25. Since local government organisation in each conurbation needs to beconsidered as a whole, any review of county districts within those areas shouldbe carried out by the Commission. However, outside the conurbations, thecounty councils should continue to be responsible for reviewing their districtareas and for proposing to the Minister any desirable changes, subject to theright of representation to him by the district authorities concerned. Thesereviews should be carried out by each county council as soon as the Commis-sion&apos;s recommendations relating to their county and the Orders arising from them have been dealt with by Parliament.26. Any changes in the areas and boundaries of county districts should, asat present, be effected by Order by the Minister. In any case where itshould appear to the Minister that the proposals of the county council requireradical alteration, he should be empowered to instruct the appropriate Corn-mission to review the county districts concerned and make recommendations.County Boroughs27. One of the first tasks with which the Commissions would have todeal is the consideration of applications for promotion to county boroughstatus, or, in the case of existing county boroughs, for the extension of theirboundaries.28. An essential qualification for promotion to county borough statusmust be the fitness of the authority concerned to discharge the functions ofa county borough. In determining this, a number of factors have to betaken into account, such as population, resources and administrative record.Apart from the claimants own fitness for promotion, consideration must also be given to the consequences which it would have for the county orcounties concerned.29. The representatives of the local authority associations have made thesuggestion, with which the Government agree, that, outside the conurbations,a town with a population of 100,000 or more should be assumed to be large enough to function effectively as a county borough and that, while an authority with a smaller population should not be precluded from applyingfor promotion, it should have to make out a strong case to justify it.30. In a conurbation, a multiplicity of autonomous local authorities isclearly undesirable. Therefore, the size of population required for promotion to county borough status should be higher there than elsewhere ; and itshould certainly not be lower than the minimum of 125,000 proposed bythe representatives of the local authority associations.31. The adoption of the proposal that a local authority with a populationof 100,000 (or, in a conurbation, of 125,000) should be presumed capableof discharging effectively the functions of a county borough council shouldnot be deemed to imply that existing county boroughs with lesser populationsare unfit to enjoy county borough status. (There are at present 34 county boroughs with a population below 100,000). Nevertheless, it would not be right to exclude this issue in all circumstances. It should be open to the commissions to recommend the withdrawal of county borough status if theyare satisfied that a particular authority is unable to discharge its responsi-bilities effectively. However, to deprive a county borough of its independent status would be a most serious step which should be contemplated only where* [t is not intended that this should preclude the submission of petitions tinder Ss. 25 and129 of the Local Government Act, 1933, which relate to wards and the creation of municipalboroughs.
it is plainly necessary for efficient administration.   As a safeguard, any jkproposal to deprive a county borough of its status should be presented toWParliament in a separate Order, so that the question could be considered onits own.32. In the case of an application by a county borough for the extensionof its boundaries, it has to be decided first, whether any expansion is justified,secondly, whether the area claimed is excessive, and thirdly, what the conse-quences will be for the county or counties affected. It is clearly not possibleto devise any simple formula by which these questions can be resolved. Itwould, however, seem reasonable that the onus should be placed on thecounty borough to establish that the advantages which the extension would confer upon its own inhabitants and those of the additional area claimedwould outweigh any disadvantages which might result for the county orcounties concerned.33. An authority which is applying simultaneously for county boroughstatus and boundary extension should be entitled to have both applicationsconsidered together.Counties34. The representatives of the local authority associations were agreed thatthe Commissions might have to consider &quot; the division, amalgamation,alteration and extension of counties&quot;. There are undoubtedly anomalousfeatures in certain county boundaries which cause administrative incon-venience and could with advantage be corrected. The Commissions should,therefore, be entitled to recommend adjustments in county boundaries, wherethey are satisfied that these are needed for efficient and economicaladministration.35. Moreover, in exceptional circumstances, promotions and extensions ofcounty boroughs might make such inroads into a county as to render it nolonger a viable unit of administration. Such cases are likely to be rare.But, where, for this or other reasons the need arises, the Commissionsshould not be precluded from recommending the amalgamation of one countywith another or, if necessary, the transfer of substantial territory.36. Any Order providing for the amalgamation of counties or for thetransfer of a substantial part of one county to another should be limitedto that proposal and any others which are directly relevant. This wouldenable the issue to be separately debated in Parliament.37. iln any event, no significant alterations should be made in the boundarybetween England and Wales, and even minor adjustments to it should requirethe consent of the county councils concerned.Conurbations38. In the large built up areas, known as &quot; cpnunbations.&quot;, special prob-lems of organisation arise. Six major conurbations have been defined by the registrar-General for census purposes Greater London, South-East Lanca-shire, the West Midlands, the West Riding, Merseyside and Tyneside. How-ever, for purposes of local government organisation the conurbations wouldnot necessarily be identical with these.39. Local administration in the conurbations is divided between numerousunits of different types and sizes.* The effect is that autonomous county boroughs are intermingled with county districts belonging to counties, ofwhich large parts lie outside the conurbation. There can be little doubtthat these haphazard arrangements are not conducive to efficiency or economy.* For example, in the South-East Lancashire conurbation, there are over 50 local authorities(2 counties, 7 county boroughs, 15 non-county boroughs, 29 urban districts and one rural district).
40. There are various possible methods of improving the pattern of localgovernment within the conurbations. One is to acquiesce in the continued existence of a patchwork of local authorities of different types and with dilfer-ent powers, but to endeavour to reduce their number. This could be achieved by amalgamating county districts, by expanding county boroughs and creatingnew ones, and by adjusting county boundaries so as to reduce the number of counties involved.41. A second method is to reorganise the area on a uniform basis. Thecounty borough is the normal form of government for a big town, and county boroughs do in fact form the core of most of the conurbations. In the large,conurbations, the creation of a single all-embracing county borough wouldnot be practicable, but it might be possible to form a group of county boroughswhich, between them, would cover the whole area.42. Either of these methods would still leave unresolved the problem,of those local authority services which may need to be co-ordinated oradministered in common for the whole conurbation. Such co-ordinationor common administration might be secured by creating joint bodies, repre-sentative of the various authorities in the conurbation ; though this courseWould have the disadvantages of any system of indirect representation.Alternatively, a directly elected upper tier authority might be created to dealwith all the services requiring joint action.43. It is thus clear that there is no simple or wholly unobjectionablesolution to the problem of local government organisation in the conurba-tions. Moreover, conditions in the different areas are not identical; andthe same treatment may not necessarily be appropriate for all. It may, there-fore, be right that provision should be made for alternative solutions, andthat the Commissions should be asked to recommend the one which seemsmost appropriate in each case.Greater London44. The conurbation of Greater London is unique. It has a populationof over 8 million, which is imore than three times as large as that of any of;the other conurbations. Some 5-\ million people live in the two whollyurban counties of London and Middlesex. The conurbation also embracesover 35 county districts, divided among 4 other administrative counties, and3 county boroughs.45. The administrative County of London has a system of local govern-ment different from any other, and any changes in its organisation would,therefore, have to be specially considered. None of the present proposals,accordingly, apply to the structure of local government within the county of London.46. Middlesex presents a special problem of a different kind. While it contains no county boroughs, it has eleven boroughs with populations wellabove the present statutory minimum for promotion to that status. the promotion of all or even of the largest of these authorities would involvethe virtual extinction of the county. In fact, in Middlesex there are reallyonly two practical alternatives either to have no county boroughs at all,or to have nothing but county boroughs and abolish the county. In allthe circumstances, the Government consider that the two-tier structure shouldbe retained throughout Middlesex and that no promotions to county boroughstatus should be made. However, a review of its district areas should becarried out by the Commission. Meanwhile, the desirability of some furtherdelegation or transfer of functions within the county of Middlesex shouldbe discussed by the local authorities concerned.32258
47. The remaining parts of the conurbation have features in common withthe other conurbations and the problems raised by these should be approachedon similar lines. It is, therefore, proposed that these areas should be included within the scope of the Commission^ review, in the course of this review the Commission are also bound to have to consider the question whether there are matters which should and could be handled jointly on behalf of greater London as a whole. After consultation with all the authorities concerned, the Commission should be entitled to make such recommendations as they may think desirable.County Districts48. In any review of county districts, the principal problem is that of reducing the number of unduly small authorities which still exist in many parts of the country. There are some 700 county districts in England andWales with populations of less than 15,000, nearly 500 with less than 10,000and over 200 with less than 5,000.49. The extent of this problem varies from county to county. This is partly due to the differing manner in which the county councils carried out their reviews in the years before the war. As was stated in 1945 in theWhite Paper on Local Government in England and Wales:  &quot; Some county councils undertook the work with vigour, and the resulting system of county districts and parishes in these counties was satisfactory and probably calls for little, if any, revision on a secondreview. Others met with strong opposition from interests concerned tomaintain the status quo and the proposals put forward were inadequate.&quot;Another difficulty has been the special position of non-county boroughs,some of which are very small.50. When the next series of reviews ta&apos;kes place, it is essential that countycouncils should tackle with determination the task of reviewing the areas andboundaries of their county districts and should recommend any changesnecessary to secure administrative units with adequate population&apos; and resources. It might be helpful for some guidance to be given as to theminimum population which is desirable in a county district. However, itwould have to be recognised that local circumstances vary greatly, particu-larly in the more sparsely populated areas, and that consequently no standardcould be rigidly applied.Non-County Boroughs51. One of the obstacles to the rational organisation of county districtshas been the inability of county councils to deal with non-county boroughsin the same way as with other county districts. For example, a countycouncil has the power to propose the transfer of a rural district to a non-county borough, but it may not propose the reverse. Therefore, where twosuch districts are amalgamated, the resultant unit must be a borough.52. The Government agree with the associations&apos; representatives that a county council should be free to recommend changes in the boundaries and status of any of its county districts, including non-county boroughs. Never-theless, it must be recognised that these boroughs, by virtue of their Charters,history and traditions, are in a special position. The Government, therefore,consider that every effort should be made to preserve so far as possible theiridentity and dignities.
53. Where a non-county borough is amalgamated with another pre-dominantly urban area, there is not normally any reason why the wholeof the combined area should not have the status of a borough. But wherethe result of the amalgamation would be a predominantly rural area, the title to be accorded to the new unit and the retention of traditional dignitiesby any borough or boroughs included in it will need special consideration.Where it is decided not to accord the title privileges and dignities of aborough to a predominantly rural area embracing an existing borough, pro-vision might be made for the identity and perhaps certain of the dignitiesof the borough to be preserved within the new unit.54. iln any case, no non-county borough should be deprived of its statuswithout the specific consent of the Minister; and this should not be givenuntil he has held an inquiry into any objections which the borough may wishto make.Parishes55. Parish councils can be most valuable in focussing opinion in smallrural communities and in performing small but useful functions of a purely local character. But, if they are to make their full contribution, theirboundaries will in some cases need revision.56. County councils have the power to review parish areas and have done so from time to time in the past. The general review of county districts shouldbe accompanied or followed by a reconsideration of parish boundaries. Theobject should be to secure that, wherever practicable, each parish is repre-sented by a parish council. In some cases, this might be achieved either byamalgamating two or more parishes, or by grouping them under a joint council.Functions57. As part of any review of local government organisation, the questionof the distribution of functions between different types of authorities mustbe considered. But, since it is intended to retain broadly the existingstructure of local government, this question can be examined separately fromthose of status and boundaries dealt with in earlier paragraphs.58. The representatives of the Local Authority Associations recommendedsome re-distribution of functions between county councils and county district councils. Though they were not agreed as to which functions, or parts of functions, should be re-distributed, they considered that the aim should beto secure that all functions are exercised at the lowest administrative levelconsistent with efficiency and economy.59. While accepting this general aim, it must be recognised that nowadaysthe main local government services call for large financial resources, hichlyqualified staff and substantial units of administration. This inevitably limits the scope for the transfer of functions to the smaller authorities. Moreover,the extent to which this is practicable will, vary with different services.60. The Ministers concerned have been discussing this matter with repre-sentatives of the local authority associations. In the light of these discussions,each is considering what changes are desirable in the distribution of thosefunctions for which he is responsible, and will, in due course, announce theGovernments conclusions. In regard to certain services this question is bound up with wider issues of policy ; and in such cases it may not be possibleto settle the distribution of functions until those other issues have beendecided.
Finance61. While it is important to secure improvements in the machinery for determing the boundaries and status of local authorities and in the dis-tribution of their functions, it is of equal importance to ensure that thefinancial structure of local administration is sound.62. The Government have accordingly put in hand a comprehensive reviewof local authority finance. The object is to ascertain what alterations in thepresent financial arrangements are desirable, in the light of the extensivechanges which have taken place in the scope and duties of local government since this matter was last examined in 1929. In considering this problem, the primary aim must be to assure the provision of efficient and economical local services and to increase as far as possible the financial responsibility of localauthorities.63. The review embraces every aspect of local finance, including exchequer grants of all kinds, the basis of valuation for rating, the principle of deratingand other possible new sources of local revenue. This involves much detailed study and raises important issues of national policy. Nevertheless, the reviewis already well advanced ; and the Government hope to be able to make an announcement of their conclusions before the end of the year.Legislation64. In order to effect changes in the structure, functions or finance of localgovernment, legislation would naturally be needed. Before framing such legislation, the Government will wish to have further discussions with therepresentatives of the local authorities and to consider the views which maybe expressed in Parliament and elsewhere.
APPENDIXPROPOSALS AGREED BY REPRESENTATIVES OFLOCAL AUTHORITY ASSOCIATIONSI. THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM1. The present system of local government is one-tier administration in Ihelarge cities and towns, and, in the administrative counties, two-tier in the smallertowns and three-tier in the rural districts. The approach in this paper is thatthis structure works well and that it should be maintained ; but that it could bemade to work better if certain matters were dealt with.2. The matters which require attention are these:(a) the need to ensure that all authorities (in all categories) are so constitutedas to be, individually and collectively, effective and convenient unitsof local government ;(b) claims by county boroughs to extend their boundaries and by non-county boroughs and urban districts to become county boroughs ;(c) the effect on the counties concerned of the extensions and promotionsclaimed ;(d) the wish of county districts (particularly the larger ones) to exercise, either&quot;as of right&quot; or by delegation, some of the functions now discharged by county councils ;(e) the need to improve the organisation of local government in the conurbations ;(f) the desirability, after necessary changes have been made, of avoidingfurther changes for a substantial period.3. A review of local government finance, including the financial relationsbetween central and local government and the effect upon county finances of the proposals for reorganisation, should be started as soon as possible by theGovernment Departments concerned, with the object of seeing how far thefinancial independence of local authorities can be strengthened.ij. POLICY PROPOSALSPromotion to County Borough Status outside Conurbations4. An application by a non-county borough or an urban district for promotion to county borough status should be considered in the light of:(a) its ability (having regard to population, resources and other factors) todischarge effectively and conveniently the functions of a countyborough ; and(b) the effect which the promotion if made would have on the county as awhole! (Among the relevant factors to be considered in this connectionshould be other applications for promotion and the- possibility of adjustment in county boundaries or, in appropriate cases, of amalg;.ma-lions of one county with another.5. Two or more authorities should be entitled to make a joint applicationfor amalgamation and simultaneous promotion to county borough status.6. It should be permissible for an authority to apply for an extension of itsboundaries and for promotion to county borough status, and for both questions to be considered at the same lime.7. In considering an application by a non-county borough or urban districtfor promotion to county borough status, there should be a presumption that an authority with a population of 100,000 or more (having regard to the nrovisionsof paragraphs 5 and 6) is able to discharge effectively and conveniently thefunctions of a county borough (see paragraph 4 (a)).
8. An authority with a population of less than 100,000 which seeks promotion to county borough status should be required to show exceedingly good reasonto justify promotion, having regard to both (a) and (b) of paragraph 4.Extension of County Boroughs9. An application by a county borough for an extension of its boundariesshould be considered in the light of all relevant factors, including the effecton the administrative county.Withdrawal of County Borough Status10. The withdrawal of county borough status on the grounds of inability todischarge effectively and conveniently all the functions of a county borough,having regard to population, resources and other factors, might be considered as part of any reorganisation.Alteration of County Boundaries11. The division, amalgamation, alteration and extension of counties might also be considered as part of any reorganisation.Conurbations12. By conurbations are meant large areas of more or less continuous urban development containing a substantial number of local authorities. (the definition of the areas to be regarded as conurbations for the purposes of localgovernment reorganisation will need further consideration.) The pattern oflocal government in these areas should be looked at as a whole. The aim should be to ensure, throughout each conurbation, individually and collectivelyelfcctive and convenient units of local government. Inside conurbations thecase for the creation of a county borough or for the extension of the boundaries of a county borough should be looked at equally with the need for securing a proper organisation of local government on a two-tier basis in the parts of theconurbation outside county boroughs.13. Subject to the previous paragraph, applications for promotion to countyborough status inside conurbations (excluding the Counties of London andMiddlesex) should be treated on the same lines as applications from authoritieselsewhere ; but the minimum population for eligibility for promotion within aconurbation.should be 125,000, subject to the provisions of paragraphs 5 and above.14. Middlesex should be preserved as a two-tier urban County, and its county districts should be ineligible fcr promotion to coUnly borough status. As partof any such arrangement, there should be some redistribution of powers betweenthe County and the District Councils, including the conferment on the latter ofsome powers not at present exercised by the County District Councils. Thiswould take place after any necessary boundary adjustments or amalgamations.Alteration of District Boundaries.15. County councils should review county districts and make recommendations to the Minister for dividing, extending, altering or amalgamating their areas,so that they would be, individually and collectively, effective and convenient unitsof local government, having regard to the factors set out below :(a) Community of interest.(b) Development, or anticipated development.(c) Economic and industrial characteristics.(:/) Financial resources measured in relation to financial need, including inparticular, but not exclusively, the average rateable value per head of population, rates raised per head of population and the - estimatedproduct of a given rate poundage.(c) Physical features including in particular, but not exclusively, suitableboundaries, means of communication and accessibility to administrativecentres and centres of business and social life.(/) Population size, distribution and characteristics.(g) Record of administration by the local authorities concerned.(h) Size and shape of the areas.(0 Wishes of the inhabitants.
16. Non-county boroughs should be included in the reviews, and it should beopen to county councils to recommend alterations in their boundaries and status.But no non-county borough should lose its status without the specific consent ofthe Minister, and the Minister should not give his consent until he has held an inquiry into any objections raised by the borough. (The question of preserving the Charter privileges cf small ncn-county boroughs who may lose their status,and of the title to be given to any new unit embracing a former borough will need further consideration.)Functions of County, County District and Parish Councils17. Certain functions at present exercisable by county councils should be conferred as of right on county districts with a population of more than a figure to be specified&quot;&quot;. A county district council that does not wish to exercise powers conferred on them should be able to relinquish them to the county council.Changes in functions following on increases or decreases of population shouldtake place at fixed times e.g. in the light of the Census figures.18. Tn addition, county councils should delegate certain functions to county district councils in accordance with provisions to be made.19. The extent to which delegation of particular functions may be appropriateshould, after consultation with the associations, be laid down under statute.20. Within the limits of what is laid down, each county council should considerjointly with its county district councils their claims to exercise functions whichmight be delegated and prepare within a given time a &quot; county delegationscheme &quot; showing the functions which it is proposed to delegate to each districtcouncil and the extent of the delegation. Where there was objection lo theprovisions or operation of a scheme, there should be a right of appeal to theappropriate Minister.21. Other functions should be the exclusive responsibility either of countycouncils (subject to a general power of delegation) or of county district andparish councils.22. Certain changes relating to functions have been proposed by the respectivelocal authority associations&quot;!&apos;. It is recognized that the redistribution of functionsmust first be discussed with the Government Departments concerned and besubject to their views. The aim should be to secure that all functions areexercised at the lowest administrative level consistent with efficiency and economy.Parishes23. The role of parish councils in focussing local opinion should if possiblebe strengthened.III.   PROCEDURE FOR IMPLEMENTATIONLocal Government Commission24. To assist in carrying out the policy outlined above there should be created by statute a Local Government Commission. Its task should be to undertakereviews and, after consultation with all local authorities concerned, lo make recommendations in regard to the following matters:(a) promotion to county borough status;(6) extension of county borough boundaries ;* Since these proposals were agreed, the County Councils Association have stated that,on further consideration, they would prefer that the functions concerned should be &quot; com-pulsorily delegated &quot; rather than &quot; conferred &quot;.f The functions in question are: Civil Defence; Coroners; Classified Roads and County Bridges; Diseases of Animals;Education (primary, secondary and further); Fertilizers and Feeding Stuffs; Food andDrugs (including Milk and Dairies); Functions under Part 111 of the Town and country Planning Act, 1947; Libraries; Local Health and Welfare services (underthe National Health Service and National Assistance Acts); Smallholdings; Shops;Theatres and Cinemas; Weights and Measures.
(c) withdrawal of county borough status;(d) division, amalgamation, alteration and extension of counties ; and(c) division, amalgamation, alteration and extension of local government areas in conurbations ; each county council concerned to be consulted on the complete proposals affecting its area as provided in paragraph 27.Confirmation by Parliament25. The Commission^ reports should be presented to the Minister and published.The Commission^ recommendations, subject to such amendments as the minister might see fit to make, should be embodied in a series of orders. These orders,each covering a substantial area (except in the cases referred to in the following paragraph), should be submitted to Parliament for approval or rejection (but notamendment).26. An order providing for the withdrawal from a borough of its countyborough status, or for the amalgamation of one county with another, or involving the disappearance of an administrative county, should provide only for that andsuch other changes as were directly related to that provision.27. Draft proposals by the Local Government Commission arising from the irreview of conurbation should be submitted to the county councils and county district councils concerned, and any objections they raised to proposals relatinglo their areas should be taken into consideration by the Commission. Where theCommission were unable to reach agreement with the county councils the latter should set out their views, either as objections or in the form of counter-proposals, and these should be included by the Commission in the Report to theMinister which should be published. In presenting to Parliament a conurbationorder objected to by the county council, the Minister should state the reasonfor his adoption or rejection of recommendations of the county council.28. A.11 lecal authorities affected by any proposal of the Commission shouldhave the right to make representations to the Minister.Reviews of County Districts by Counties29. As soon as possible after Parliament had pronounced on the Commission^recommendations relating to their area, each county council should proceed tocarry out, and complete within a prescribed period, their reviews of county districts in the manner referred to in paragraph 15 above. The procedure for thesereviews should broadly follow that provided for in Section 146 of the LocalGovernment Act, 1933, except as otherwise stated in paragraph 16 above.Wales30. It is proposed that a separate Commission for Wales should be established,a majority of whose members should have special knowledge of Wales. TheCommission^ terms of reference should be similar to those of the English Corn-mission. No alteration affecting the boundaries between England and wales should be made except with the consent of the county councils concerned, andno major alteration in any case.Standstill after Review31. After Parliament had decided the orders arising from the Commissions&apos;reviews, no further changes should be made in the areas or status of counties and county boroughs for a period of 15 years, unless in a particular case therewere, altogether exceptional circumstances.Interim Arrangements32. Pending a decision on these proposals, it is undesirable:(a) that there should be any reviews of county districts under Section 146of the Local Government Act, 1933 ; or that any individual districtshould be eliminated without their consent, unless in the most exceptional circumstances ;(b) that there should be any promotion of a non-county borough or urban district to county borough status or any extension of a county boroughexcept where all the authorities concerned are in agreement.
NOTES1. The above proposals were agreed by representatives of :The County Councils Association.The Association of Municipal Corporations.The Urban District Councils Association.The Rural District Councils Association.The National Association of Parish Councils.2. Since the discussions were confidential, the representative could not consulttheir associations. They did, however, refer the proposals to their executive orother appropriate committees, who informed the Minister that, subject to the satis-factory outcome of the subsequent discussions on functions, they would recom-mend them to their respective associations. The Association of Municipal Corpora-tions added that their agreement was given in the light of the Ministers assurance that a thorough review of local government finance would take place.3. The London County Council was not represented at the discussions. Theproposals do not apply to the County of London.(32258)  Wt.      -1051   13, 121   7/56  D.L.
