UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET- -) C.P. (56) 160 COPY NO.     63rd July, 1956CABINETREMUNERATION OF DOCTORSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of HealthOur Departments have recently received from the British medical association a memorandum, outlining the case they want to make for anincrease of not less than 24 per cent in the remuneration of general practitioners and hospital medical staff from 1st April, 1956.    They askus to give our preliminary consideration to their memorandum, to send them our observations on it and then to receive a deputation to discussthe matter,2.     The main argument is that the pay of general practitioners was put on a proper basis in 1950-51 by the Danckwerts award;  that the pay of consultants and other hospital staff was by the 1954 settlement put in a correct relationship with that, of general practitioners;  that since 1951there has been.a 24 per cent decline in the value of money;  and that in thesame period comparable professions have received even higherpercentage increases.    They refer particularly to the Government^acceptance of the pay increases recommended by the Royal Commissionon the Civil Service.    It is also argued that the Spens Reports on medicalremuneration and the Danckwerts award give the doctors a contractualright to periodical adjustments in their pay.3.     A.t present general practioners get an average net income of about 2,220 a year.    Whole-time consultants have a basic scale of 2,100 -  3, 100;  34 per cent of them receive distinction awards as well,the 4 per cent with the highest awards receiving in all  5,300 a year.There are, of course, also various lower grades of hospital doctors onlower remuneration.4.     The cost of admitting such a claim in full would not be far short of  20 millions a year.    To concede it, either in full or in part, would obviously have serious repercussions;  for example, dentists, from whomnotice of a claim has already been received, would expect similar increases.5.     We are clear that the doctors have no contractual rights to anyadjustment and we think that the claim should not be entertained.6.     If this is agreed, it is necessary to decide the grounds on whichthe claim should be rejected.    We have considered the possibility of arejection on merits, but think that this would lead us into much detailedargument and might make it difficult to resist a demand for arbitrationsWe have come to the conclusion that the decision should be based onbroader grounds of public policy and should be expressed in the terms-1-
of the short official letter appended to this paper, which should be sentwithout delay.7.     This, of course, leaves the doctors free to renew their claim whenpresent difficulties lessen; when that time comes it may have to be examined on its merits, but the reply we suggest leaves us completelyuncommitted on what those merits may be.8.     Rejection of the claim may lead to a demand for arbitration,Notwithstanding the 1952 Danckwerts adjudication, and in spite of a qualified promise given to hospital doctors by the Labour Government in1949, the doctors have no legal rights to arbitration and we are proposingrejection of the claim on the footing that if arbitration is asked for itwill be refused,9.     It may be that a case can be established for some adjustments inthe salaries of the lower paid hospital grades, who have had no increase for over two years.    We do not exclude this possibility and our proposed reply, which would refer to a general increase in medical remuneration,is intended to leave the door open for such adjustments.    Their settlement would be a matter for the Medical Whitley Council, after the usualconsultations between the Health Departments and the Treasury.10.   We ask the Cabinet to agree that we should reject the doctors&apos;claim on the basis shown in the draft letter appended and that we shouldturn down any request for arbitration.J.S.R.H.T.3rd July, 1956.
Medical RemunerationProposed reply to the doctors&apos; Negotiating CommitteeOn 14th June you wrote to me, and to the Secretary ofthe Department of Health for Scotland, enclosing copies of amemorandum in which a claim is made for an increase of notless than 24 per cent in the present remuneration of general practitioners and hospital medical staff.    You asked the Ministerand the Secretary of State to give the memorandum their preliminary consideration and said that the Negotiating Committee would like tohave their observations before asking them to receive a deputation.The Ministers have now read the memorandum and we are asked by them to say that in present economic and financial circum-stances they would not feel justified in giving consideration to any claim for a general increase in medical remuneration.    In view ofthis the Negotiating Committee may wish to defer sending their proposed deputation at the present time.The Secretary of State for Scotland has suggested that thesecond paragraph should begin as follows:-&quot;The Ministers have now read the memorandum.They are clear that no question of any contractual right    ^to an adjustment arises and we are asked by them ...&quot; ^ .
