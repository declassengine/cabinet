HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIALG.P.(56) 15627th June, 1956COPY NO.CABINET.B.C. EXTERNAL services memorandum by tlie Secretary of State for Foreign affairs seek the agreement of my colleagues in terminating theB.B.C, foreign language broadcasts to all the countries in Europe withthe exception of those addressed to the iron curtain countries,Yugoslavia, Turkey, Greece and Germany.    The German service wouldbe retained but reorganised with a view to making East Germany itsprincipal target.ARGUMENT2.        I have reached this conclusion after considering the need foreconomies in the information vote and on the best information in mypossession as to the value of these services.    The Drogheda committee report cast doubt on the effectiveness of some of them and recommendedspecifically the abolition of the French, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish,Danish, Norwegian and Dutch broadcasts.    My proposal would add tothese the Spanish and Finnish services.3.        The B.B.C. claim that they have a large listening audience inEurope.    They have also argued that the services must remain in beingsince the reputation which they won during the war should not be abandoned and would be invaluable in a future war.    This argumentseems no longer applicable, since the nature of war has changed.    Asregards the present audience our embassies in most European countriesdo not believe that people of any prominence listen to B.B.C. broadcastsand regard their influence as negligible.    Whilst an exact estimate isin the nature of the case impossible, I think it is fair to conclude thatthe B.B.C, foreign language broadcasts are no longer an important factor in the sophisticated world of Western Europe, and that this tendency is likely to increase.4.        I see no way of bringing about these reductions in the present financial year.    My Department have been precluded from discussing with the B.B.C. ways and means of carrying out such a step; but itwould seem likely that engagements which the B.B.C. have entered intowith their staff would alone make action this year impossible.    For thesame reasons I can give no reliable estimate of the savings which wouldresult.    The B.B.C. when invited by the Drogheda Committee in 1953to estimate the savings likely to be produced by abolishing seven services to Western Europe, gave a tentative figure of  13 5, 000.    How much larger the eventual annual saving might be if my present proposals are adopted cannot be forecast until they have been gone into in detail withtheB.B,C.
4.        A decision to abolish a large part of foreign language broad-casting to Europe will raise a considerable protest in Parliament andwe must avoid the charge that we are deliberately diminishing British influence and damaging a national institution.    We should, therefore,base our decisions on the recommendations of the Drogheda report and on the need to reshape our broadcasting policy in the light of politicaland technical changes since the war.    The Drogheda Report howeverrecommended that the B.B.C.&apos;s efforts should be expanded in other directions, notably by building a relay in Cyprus to make the Arabicbroadcasts effective in the Middle East.     The need for this last hasincreased since the Drogheda Committee reported and must be considered as a first priority in1 any redeployment which may emerge from discussions with the B.B.C, about the West European services.Recommendations:I therefore recommend that I should be authorised  -(a) to inform the B.B.C, that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment have decided to terminate the broadcasts to Western Europe in French,Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, Danish,Norwegian, Dutch, Finnish and Spanish;  andto reshape the German service so that its primarytarget should be East Germany;(b) to report to the Cabinet after discussion withthe B.B.C. the savings likely to result, with(c) any proposals for strengthening other overseaservices of the B.B.C. that may be requiredin the light of the world situation.S.L.Foreign Office, S.W.1.26th June, 1956.
