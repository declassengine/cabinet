THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT1       Printed for the Cabinet. July 1956SECRET Copy No.   28CP. (56) 18519th July, 1956CABINETOXFORD ROADSMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentThe unique beauty of Oxford, which is visited each year by countlessthousands from all over the world, is being sadly marred by the ever-increasingflow of traffic through the University area.2. Some years ago, an expert study of this problem was carried out for theCity Council by an independent planning consultant, Dr. Thomas Sharp. he advised that the only effective method of relieving the pressure of traffic at Carfaxand along The High was to build a new road across Christ Church Meadow,alongside the Broad Walk and linking up with St. Giles (as shown in red on theattached map). However, this proposal aroused criticism in University circles,especially among the Colleges which overlook The Meadow.3. Discouraged by this reaction, the City Council, when submitting their development plan, hesitated to put forward any effective scheme for dealing withthis problem. Consequently, when approving the plan a year ago, I felt obliged,in agreement with the Minister of Transport, to ask the Council to submitadditional road proposals for relieving the traffic congestion.4. Last autumn, with my encouragement, the Council submitted a compromise proposal, which did not entail putting a road through The Meadow.This scheme provided for two &quot; relief roads &quot; substantially farther out, one to thenorth and the other to the south, forming in effect an inner by-pass system (shownin green on the map). However, this unavoidably entailed several unpopularfeatures, such as a traffic roundabout in St. Giles, the demolition of a number of buildings belonging to certain colleges and the destruction of some college playing fields. As a result, the new plan met with even stronger opposition from theUniversity than the proposal for a road through The Meadow.5. The whole issue was exhaustively examined last February at a ten-daypublic inquiry. The official who conducted the inquiry reported that the compromise proposal for a by-pass system of relief roads away from the centrehad not only failed to allay University opposition, but, as might be expected ofany compromise, would be only partially effective in relieving the traffic congestion.He concluded that what is needed is an alternative road so close to the High Streetthat it can be used as a substitute for it. Furthermore, he advised that the only practicable route for such a road is along the northern side of Christ ChurchMeadow, as previously recommended by Dr. Sharp.6. The Minister of Transport and I have gone very fully into the matter, andwe agree entirely with this conclusion. A new road through The Meadow andlinking up with St. Giles offers the only satisfactory method of diverting traffic form the University area. This would, moreover, make it reasonable to closeMagdalen Bridge to vehicles, which is really the only way to restore peace to the heart of the University.50212
7. Notwithstanding all that has been said to the contrary, I am convincedthat enjoyment of The Meadow, whose charm lies mainly in its riverside walkson the south and east, would not be very seriously affected by a road across thenorthern end, and that any aesthetic loss would be much more than offset by the gain of quiet and dignity within the precincts of the University.8. If this solution is approved in principle, the exact line of the road will need careful consideration, in particular, the section from Queen Street to St. Giles.The route for this section proposed by Dr. Sharp would entail the demolition ofcertain important buildings and would involve the creation of a somewhat awkwardroundabout at the junction of the Cornmarket and George Street. However, after consulting the officials of the City Council, the Minister of Transport and I believethat it may be feasible to provide a link with St. Giles which would be more efficient and cause less disturbance to important property. One of the possible alternative routes for this sector of the road is shown by red dots on the map.9. I propose accordingly to reject the City Councils scheme for theconstruction of two &quot; relief roads.&quot; I would inform them that, in the opinion ofthe Minister of Transport and myself, the right solution is a road which can beused in substitution for the High Street and the Cornmarket; and that we considerthat the only practicable route is across the northern part of Christ ChurchMeadow, through St. Ebbe&apos;s and linking up with St. Giles. I would ask theCouncil to submit new proposals for such a road, after consultation with theMinistry of Transport and my Department.10. A lead of this sort would, I am advised, be welcomed by the majority ofthe Council, which is fairly representative of opinion in the town generally.However, strong protests must be expected from a section of the University, led by Christ Church. Most of the Colleges on The High and on The Broad andothers whose property was threatened by the proposed inner by-pass will probablybe pleased, though they may not be so vocal in expressing their approval.11. The Minister of Transport and I would be glad to have, our colleagues&apos;agreement to the course we propose.D. S.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W.1,18th July, 1956.
