OP secret copy No.C.P. (56) 16110th July, 1956CABINETCYPRUSNote by the Secretary of the CabinetSince the Cabinefs discussion of a draft Parliamentary statement on Cyprus on 5th July (C. M. (56) 47th Conclusions, Minute 8) the viewsof the Governor have been obtained.2.     The attached revised draft statement has been prepared after consideration by the Colonial Policy Committee of the Governor&apos;scomments.(Signed) NORMAN brook cabinet Office, S.W.1,10th July, 1956.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of.
DRAFT statement in order that the House may be able to form a true judgment ofthe situation which has been reached regarding Cyprus, it is, I think,desirable that I should remind Hon. Members of the recent history ofthis problem.    As the House will remember, in September 1955Her Majesty&apos;s Government held a Tripartite Conference with the greek and Turkish Governments.    The chief purpose of this Conference wasto discover whether a way could be found to reconcile the differencesdividing the Governments concerned on the question of Cyprus,    TheGovernments proved unable to agree at that time on a common policy.2.     Her Majesty&apos;s Government then decided to try to make progress towards a solution by means of discussions on the Island itself betweenthe Governor of Cyprus and Archbishop Makarios.    These discussionslasted several months but,for reasons which have previously beendebated in this House, they broke down.3.     Her Majesty&apos;s Government then decided to make another approach to this most intractable question on the international level.    Theprinciple of self-determination had been accepted by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment.    The problem was therefore whether a solution regardingits application could be devised which would provide fully for theprotection not only of our own interests in Cyprus and the eastern mediterranean but also of those of Turkey and of other countries to whom we have treaty obligations.4.     Unfortunately this has not yet been found possible.    Indeed, ourTurkish allies have made plain their view that steps to create conditionswhich might lead to the application of self-determination for Cypruswould raise far wider issues for them as parties to the Lausannetreaty settlement.5,     The House will readily understand the risks which would be involved if Her Majesty&apos;s Government were to attempt to proceedunilaterally in this matter of self-determination, which so clearlycontains the seeds of grave danger to the whole future of the eastern mediterranean.    As it has proved impossible to obtain international agreement, Her Majesty&apos;s Government have to accept that for the presentprogress by this means cannot be realised.6.     But certain steps can be taken within the Island itself.    her majesty&apos;s Government therefore intend to proceed with the developmentof internal self-government in Cyprus.    For this purpose they havedecided to ask Lord Radcliffe to start work forthwith as ConstitutionalCommissioner,    It will be his task to consider the framework of a new and liberal constitution for Cyprus, including safeguards for theinterests of all communities, and to make recommendations.    He willbe leaving to-morrow for a preliminary visit to Cyprus,    Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment intend on his return to draw up detailed terms of reference the new constitution would not however be put into effect until terrorismhad been overcome and law and order had been restored.    The rate of progress in this constitutional development must of course depend on theextent of the co-operation of the people of Cyprus.
