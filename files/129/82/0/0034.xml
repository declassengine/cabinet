Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1956The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. It is issued for the personal use of......TOP SECRET Copy No.\ \CP. (56) 18420th July, 1956CABINETEGYPTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will have seen the statement to the press by the EgyptianAmbassador to Washington to the effect that Egypt has decided to accept assistancefrom the West for the construction of the High Aswan Dam. They will also havenoticed the recent action of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which, accordingto Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington, is widely interpreted as a veto forany American aid for the Dam. Telegrams 1528 and 1529 from Washington refer.Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington is already in close touch with Mr. Dullesand the State Department and will be seeing Mr. Dulles again at any moment.There is very close agreement between the Americans and ourselves. I attachas Annexe A a summary of the latest instructions to Sir R. Makins on how thisquestion should be handled.2. Our attitude to the question of the Dam is in accordance with our present general policy towards Egypt. I attach, as Annexe B, a note which gives somebackground information relevant to our relations with Colonel Nasser and whichraises the question whether, and how soon, we should move over to a more overtlyhostile line towards him. I do not suggest that we should do so now.3. Even without such a change in our policy, however, there is more to bedone on the propaganda side. The Appendix to Annexe B shows what is being done already.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W.1,18th July, 1956.50219b
ANNEXE&apos; ASUMMARY OF INSTRUCTIONS SENT TO HER MAJESTY&apos;ambassador, WASHINGTONSir R. Makins&apos; latest conversation with Mr. Dulles shows that we and the americans are agreed that we should neither go ahead with our offers of last december nor definitely withdraw them.2. Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador has been instructed to tell Mr. Dulles at their next meeting that the following is our present and tentative thinking as to the line we should now take with the Egyptians. It is likely that Mr. Dulles will agree.3. We should point out to the Egyptians that in the last six months we have become progressively worried at the apparent trend of Egyptian financial policy.The Egyptians seem to contemplate Russian financial aid for other projects thanthe Dam; and we know from the activities of the Egyptian Quartermaster-general in this country that they are thinking in terms of setting up a vehicles industry.They want to build a shipyard at Alexandria. Their purchases of arms from theRussians have not been a &quot; once and for all&quot; matter but have continued. their reserves of foreign exchanges have continued to fall, despite substantial releases from the sterling balances. How do the Egyptians square this with their proposedundertaking to the International Bank to &quot; maintain sound financial and economic policies including an investment programme which will recognise the priority ofthe High Dam project? &quot;4. We should be careful how we put our line across since it can. all too easily be represented as interference and as an attempt to attach political strings to ouroffers.5. Sir R. Makins is to make it clear to Mr. Dulles that we do not like the idea,to which Mr. Dulles has made a passing reference, of telling Nasser that we cannotgo ahead with the High Dam project but might give him economic aid in someother form.S. L.ANNEXE BPOLICY  TOWARDS  EGYPT  WITH  PARTICULAR   REFERENCETO PROPAGANDAThe main instruments of Egyptian propaganda in the Middle East are:  (a) Cairo Radio, whose geographical position enables it to cover a large partof the Arabic-speaking world with medium-wave, broadcasts, and whichcan call upon the services, of entertainers, &amp;.c., known throughout the;     region. ... , [ &apos;&apos;.r\h]j(b) The Egyptian newspapers and especially magazines, which, in technique,and sophistication, are far ahead of any others printed in Arabic.(c) Teachers, &amp;c, of whom the Egyptian Government are themselves short,but whom they nevertheless make available for export to meet a region-wide, shortage. There is no satisfactory alternative source ofsuch people.(d) Colonel Nasser&apos;s Saudi Arabian allies, who exert their influence in politicalcircles mainly by lavish bribery in favour of his policies.,. .
2. Any Egyptian Government must enjoy a very strong natural positionamong the Arab States of the Middle East. Egypt is more populous than any ofthese; her people, although not really Arabs, are approximately similar to them in language, religion and colour of skin; and above all Cairo excels all others of the region in shops, cinemas, cabarets, glossy magazines and other such marks of advanced civilisation.  It is thus quite unrealistic to hope to &quot; isolate &quot; Egypt.3. . Colonel NasserY regime has further improved this position by his success in ending the British occupation and by exploiting the hostility of all Arabs to Israel. He has succeeded in assuming the lead on &quot;Arab Nationalism.&quot; his acceptance of arms from the Soviet Woe has increased the material strength ofthe Egyptian army, and, because it can be represented both as an addition toanti-Israeli strength and as a slap in the face for the &apos;; imperialists,&quot; has greatlyincreased his stature in the Arabic-speaking world.4. Nasser professes to desire better relations with us and has made severalovertures to us publicly and privately. On the other hand he continues to acceptfrom the Russians the material aid which he needs to maintain his position if he cannot get it from us. He may think that he can play off the East and West againsteach other, but he has already given the Russians a powerful hold over him. Nodoubt he aims at eliminating British political influence and ultimately at denyingus the oil of the Middle East except on his own terms. But there is muchimmediate damage that he could do us, especially in the economic field, about which he appears not to have taken irrevocable decisions. This applies not onlyto our trade, but also to our substantial fixed investments and above all to our shipping through the Suez Canal. Our economic stake in Egypt is much greaterthan anyone else&apos;s including the United States. There are compensating weaknessesin his position, particularly on the economic side. Egypfs balance of payments isdeteriorating rapidly, and he is becoming increasingly short of sterling his chiefcurrency for settlement with the West. Unlike Iraq and other oil-producing countries, he cannot raise the standard of living of his fast-expanding populationexcept by financial measures which he is not likely to take and by assistance fromabroad over a period and on a scale which are most improbable. These short-termdifficulties will only be intensified if he builds the dam. The long-term difficultiesof a one-crop economy and a rapidly rising population will remain.5. In these circumstances our policy, as agreed with the Americans, has beennot to adopt an attitude of open hostility to Nasser but rather to attempt to keephim guessing about our ultimate intentions, while doing what we can to weaken his influence in Egypt and other Arab States by covert methods. In accordance withthis policy we have not rejected Nasser&apos;s overtures out of hand. How long thisshould continue to be our policy is for consideration. The time for a change may come after we have dealt with the Aswan Dam. But there is no alternative regime in sight in Egypt, and such a change would push him more firmly into the handsof the Russians and court reprisals against our economic interests referred to above.If Nasser is shown to be completely in the hands of the Soviet, that may make otherArabs recoil from him; on the other hand, it might be the means of increasingSoviet influence in the other Arab States, like Saudi Arabia, not yet penetrated.6. Until this ambivalence in our policy is resolved, our propaganda is undera disadvantage. Overtly we do not take an anti-Egyptian line in any medium of propaganda which is attributable to Her Majesty&apos;s Government. There is noquestion of refraining from putting over material in favour of our policies and thoseof our allies, even when these are unwelcome to Nasser. On the contrary, all ourovert propaganda (at home and in the Middle East) must be directed to increasingqur own prestige and influence and those of our friends. But it is only by covertmethods that we directly attack Nasser. If and when we decide to take him ondirectly because we have succeeded in weakening his position or because it has beenshaken by other influences or because we cannot tolerate him any longer, we shallbe able to indulge in activities which he will see are directed against him by us.It is in preparation for that phase that we must have our machinery ready andticking over. ,7.   I attach a brief account of our overt propaganda activities.50219
