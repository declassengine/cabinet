secret.P. (56) 1729th July, 1956ORGANISATION FOR EUROPEAN economic co-OPERATION AND TARIFFSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe President of the Board of TradeIn little more than a week&apos;s time we have to go to Paris for a ministerial meeting of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (C.E,E.C.) where we shall face a very difficult issue on tariffs.    For a very long time the European low tariff countries -Benelux and Scandinavia - have been maintaining that it is unreasonablefor them to eliminate their quota restrictions on imports if the countriesin Europe with higher tariffs do nothing to reduce those tariffs.    Wehave consistently maintained that the proper place for tariff negotiations is in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G,A, T.T,) and,despite increasing difficulties, we have so far managed to hold thatline.2.     This time the problem will be very much more difficult for us.The feeling in favour of some action on tariffs has reached a point atwhich it is difficult to resist, and we shall be faced with specific proposals, probably backed by all members except the United Kingdomand France (whose agreement with us on this issue can hardly beconsidered an asset).    These proposals will be that all the members ofO.E.E.C. should now agree to reduce their tariffs by perhaps25 per cent on a list of commodities which are mainly traded in intra-European trade.    This would probably include some horticultural items.The reduction in tariffs proposed would be on a most-favoured-nationbasis so that uncovenanted benefits would be given to countries outside europe; but the choice of the commodities would be designed to limitthose uncovenanted benefits as far as possible.3.     But, despite the strength of the support for it and its inherentreasonableness, this is not a course which we think we can at this juncture agree to.    Not only have we just finished a round of tariff negotiations in the G.A. T.T. but British industry is faced with thepossibility of very difficult problems arising for it in Europe in thefuture.    The six so-called Messina Powers - France, Germany, Italy,Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg - are at this moment startingto work out a treaty establishing a Common Market between them.While it is uncertain whether their efforts will succeed, it is certain thatif they do we shall be faced with serious problems in commercial policyif we stand outside.    One of our main competitors in world trade,Germany, would be given very great advantages over us inside thisprosperous and expanding market in Western Europe.    Faced with thisCOPY NO.CABINET
uncertainty, it is really quite unreasonable for us to do anything whichcould be interpreted as a commitment to reduce our tariffs on Europeangoods until we can better judge how the situation will develop and how itcan be dealt with.4.     But if we merely say this and go no further, there may well be complete deadlock at the forthcoming Council Meeting in O.E.E.C. andthe effects could well be deplorable.    The tariff issue has come to be widely regarded as a test of the efficacy of the O.E.E.C. as an instrument of European co-operation;  a patent failure at this point might leave theMessina group as the focus of further activity in Europe.    For this result Her Majestyfs Government would inevitably be blamed both at homeand abroad,5.     We think therefore that the only course to adopt is to relate ourunwillingness to proceed at once to a round of tariff negotiations on amost-favoured-nation basis in O.E.E.C, to the broader background ofthe plans for a Common Market which are being developed by the MessinaGroup, and of the problems which they present for other O.E.E.C.countries, including ourselves.6.     So far as our own position goes, officials in the Departmentsconcerned are examining what would be involved for us in possible arrangements whereby we and the Messina Group would progressively removetariffs over a large part of the trade between us, but excluding trade in agricultural and horticultural products.    At the same time, by thisexclusion, and by other appropriate means if we can find them, we should seek to protect the position of the Commonwealth in the United kingdom market for agricultural products and safeguard, so far as we can, theadvantages we enjoy through Imperial Preference in the Commonwealthmarkets.    This is a difficult and far-reaching matter and we have notyet been able to work out, let alone submit, a detailed plan about it toour colleagues for their consideration.    But while these questions arebeing examined it is apparent that there would be great advantages if some of the technical problems arising between the Messina Group andother O.E.E.C. countries could be discussed with the other interestedcountries in Europe.    Moreover, the fact that such discussions were taking place would provide a sincere and convincing reason for delayingaction in O.E.E.C. on the tariff issue.7.     It is, however, clear to us that if we ourselves were forthwith inParis to propose discussion of issues of this kind, that would be taken asthe foreshadowing of a major move in United Kingdom external economic policy.    Some would be elated, some would be confused, both at homeand abroad, within and without the Commonwealth.    We clearly cannot do this until our colleagues have had an opportunity of examining a definiteplan and pronouncing upon it and thereafter until we have had anopportunity of discussing it with the other members of the Commonwealth.Indeed, the proper tactical handling of such a plan would be of the first importance.8.     But, whereas the proposal by us of such a study would be treatedas a major United Kingdom initiative, agreement by us to engage in sucha study proposed by someone else, on an all-European rather thana United Kingdom/Messina basis, would not be liable to be sointerpreted.
9.     We have therefore arranged discreetly for the Secretary-Generalof O.E.E.C, to prepare a proposal for such a study covering the wholepossible range of co-ordination and co-operation between O.E.E,,C. andthe group of six countries, but including inter alia those methods of association of individual members of O.E.E.C. with members of theMessina Common Market as seemed most appropriate.    We then, at theCouncil at what seemed the right moment, would indicate our readiness to take part in such a study.    We would hope thereby to secure agree-ment to adjourn consideration of the tariff issue in O.E.E.C. until theresults of the study were reported to a subsequent Ministerial Council.10.    We feel that the dangers inherent in this scheme are not great.We shall be able to keep the discussion going while we have time to make up our minds, and in the meantime to find out more of the detail of theprobable reactions to such a plan among those most concerned.    Weshould not have taken any action which implied we were envisaging a major move, nor should we have committed ourselves in any way.    Butwe should have reduced the present risk of a split between the 04E,E.C.and the Messina Group.    It is this line that we propose to take if our colleagues agree.H.M.F.T.7th July, 1956
