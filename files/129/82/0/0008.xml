illS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S-GOVERNMENT)secret.P. (56) 150 COPY NO.   2 y27th June, 1956CABINETLrWHITE FISH SUBSIDYNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer at last Thursday&apos;^ meeting (CM. (56) 45th Conclusions, Minute 12),the Cabinet invited me to discuss the future of the white fish subsidy withthe Ministers responsible for fishery, and to report back to the Cabinet.2.      In an attempt to dispose of the matter I wrote to the Minister ofAgriculture suggesting a compromise on the main point at issue between us - the rate of run-down of the fleet of old steam vessels.    A copy ofmy letter, which was also sent to the Home Secretary and the Secretary ofState for Scotland, is annexed.3.      I have now been informed that the Minister of Agriculture is notprepared to accept my compromise suggestion.    The Cabinet must,therefore, consider the matter again in order to settle it.H. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.27th June, 1956.ANNEXTreasury Chambers,S.W.1.25th June, 1956.Last Thursday&apos;s discussion in Cabinet of the white fish subsidymade it clear that there is now not a great deal of difference between uson what is to be done for the future.    The essential point is the rate ofrun-down of the old steam vessels, which cost so much in terms bothof subsidy and of coal imports.-1-
The rate of run-down which you have proposed is 80 vessels a year.This is actually less than the number of steam vessels which left the fleet in 1955.    It implies an increase in average payment of subsidy for eachvessel, for each day at sea, from the present rate of about  10 5s. Od. to 18- 19, almost twice as much, and would raise the total subsidy fromits present level of  2.3 millions to  3.25 millions, that is by almost 1 million, an increase of about 40 per cent.    Moreover, the subsidy would have to be extended until as late as 1963.By comparison, the rate of run-down which I have proposed -150 vessels a year - would raise the average daily rate of payment pervessel to  15 5s. Od., and the total subsidy to  2. 85 millions.    At thesame time, the disappearance of a further 70 boats would save over100, 000 tons of coal, with about  700, 000 in dollars, and would permit the subsidy to be ended in 1961.In our present economic circumstances, I have been most reluctant to agree to any increase in, or extension of, the present subsidyand a policy which would increase it by over a third, or nearly  1 million a year, and virtually double the present daily rates seems to me to be out of the question.    I had therefore hoped that you would feel able toaccept my own proposals, which would themselves mean an addition ofover  i million to the subsidy bill .and an increase of one-third in average daily rates.However, in view of the political difficulties which you foresee ina rate of run-down of 150 steam vessels a year, I have considered whether some compromise is possible.    As a result, I have come to the conclusion,though very reluctantly, that I can agree to an increase of, at most, afurther  100, 000 in the total subsidy, in addition to the  550, 000 increase which my original proposals would have cost.    This would raise the total amount of the subsidy to something just short of  3 millions a year, andwould provide for an average daily rate of about  17, a run-down of steam-vessels of the order of 120 a year, and an extension of the subsidy to 1962.It would also concede nearly three-quarters of the increase for which thetrawler-owners have asked.    Further than this, I am afraid, I could not go.You will see that these figures assume that there will be no changein the level of the inshore subsidy, and that crews settled on the grosswill be excluded from any share in the increase.    I hope that you will findno difficulty in agreeing to these two points.    The restoration of last year&apos;scut in the inshore subsidy could not be justified on economic grounds, andwould be a retrograde step which might well encourage the inshore fisher-men to expect to receive subsidy support for an indefinite time to come.The sharing of the increase in subsidy by crews settled on the gross isequally unjustifiable on economic grounds, and would produce fortuitousbenefits for such crews which we cannot afford.    Insistence on either ofthese concessions could only be met by reducing the daily rate for thesteam vessels.I am writing to Gwilym Lloyd-George and James Stuart in thesame terms.    I very much hope that you, and they, will be able to agreeto these proposals.(Signed) HAROLD MACMILLANThe Rt. Hon. D. Heathcoat Amory, M. P.
