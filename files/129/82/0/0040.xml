Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1956Copy No.CABINETBURAIMIMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my memorandum CP. (56) 52 of 24th February explained the need forresuming negotiations with Saudi Arabia in order to retain American goodwill,to delay a possible Saudi appeal to the Security Council, and to make our positionappear more reasonable if the matter did come before the Security Council. Inorder to have something to offer at the negotiations I was authorised to offer theSaudis access to the sea east of Qatar by way of special transit facilities and a free port (CM. (56) .17th Conclusions, Minute 2).2. To prepare for negotiations Mr. Dodds-Parker visited Riyadh at theend of April and during the discussions there it was agreed that H.M. ambassador should draw up a draft agenda. Mr. Dodds-Parker in his talks with Prince Faisalhinted at the possibility of a concession east of Qatar in the Khor-al-Odaid area,and behind the scenes H.M. Ambassador made sure that the Saudi ambassador in London, who was present at the talks, understood what was intended.Mr. Dodds-Parker also referred to the possibility of arranging for some at least of the pro-Saudi tribesmen now exiled from Buraimi to be allowed to return.The Saudis did not take up these offers and insisted that Buraimi was all theycared about.3. The draft agenda that the Ambassador subsequently presented contained,as its penultimate item, &quot; Matters arising out of the Buraimi dispute.&quot; The Saudishave always insisted that Buraimi should be taken and settled first before any otherAnglo-Saudi differences were tackled. After the last exchange in Riyadh betweenthe Ambassador and Prince Faisal, the latter insisted that either Buraimi should besettled first or that, if the Buraimi question were held over, a regime should be setup there based on the following four points:  (a) withdrawal of our troops from all disputed areas;(b) repatriation and compensation of refugees;(c) maintenance of law and order in areas to be restored to &quot; originalinhabitants&quot; (i.e., the local tribes most of whom have taken Saudimoney);(d) supervision of the area by a neutral administration until the dispute was settled.4. Meanwhile I agreed to see privately and unofficially Azzam Pasha, theformer Secretary-General of the Arab League and now the Saudi agent in theBuraimi dispute. A series of talks was held with Azzam and the following pointshave emerged:  (a) Azzam was impressed by the friendliness with which he was received and itis probably true that, as he claimed, King Saud is reluctant to continue his quarrel with the British. He added, however, that Faisal feels thatno good will come of further negotiations with us.50232SECRETCP. (56) 19024th July, 1956
(b) Only Buraimi-and sovereignty over Buraimi at that-matters to theSaudis; they do not regard negotiations on any other subject as serious and they will not acquiesce in the present situation in Buraimi in returnfor concessions elsewhere; neither the possibility of the exiles returningnor of concessions in the Khor-al-Odaid has been seriously taken up.(c) The Saudis have no more wish to appeal to the Security Council than wehave but the King may be driven to do so if he sees no other courseof action.(d) The Saudis evidently fear our charges of bribery and our line that the sultan of Muscat is a respectable Arab ruler whom King Saud haswronged.(e) The Saudis are ready to remove any obstacle that the oil question might present to our surrendering sovereignty.(f) The only substantial point of agreement was on the desirability of putting the whole Buraimi dispute into cold storage; unfortunately the Saudis&apos;idea of cold storage is to make the area an autonomous province underSaudi suzerainty or a neutral zone, whereas ours is to leave it as it isunder Abu Dhabi and Muscat sovereignty.5. In parting Azzam suggested that further haggling over the agenda for theRiyadh talks would probably land us in the Security Council: what was necessarynow was to take as the starting point for our next communication to the Saudis thefour proposals of Prince Faisal.6.  In these circumstances we are left with the following choices:  (a) We can try to work out an offer to the Saudis based on some at any rateof Faisal&apos;s four points;(b) We can disregard Azzam&apos;s advice (which is probably not disinterested)and continue to discuss the Agenda;or(c) We can abandon discussion of the Agenda and formally offer a solutionbased on Saudi access to the sea east of Qatar, the return of the majorityof the Buraimi exiles and minor modifications of our declared frontier.7. Choice (a) is not a runner at all. Not only would it be unacceptable tothe Sultan of Muscat but it would let the Saudis back into Buraimi and thus enablethem to resume their former bribery, subversion and gun-running. It might bepossible to work out some form of &quot; de-militarisation&quot; for Buraimi and theother disputed areas with sovereignty remaining vested in Abu Dhabi and Muscatand no Saudis allowed in. Though such an offer would no doubt be put to ourcredit in the Security Council, it would present considerable dangers from our pointof view (e.g., it would be much more difficult to prevent infiltration of Saudi agents).8. Both (b) and (c) have the disadvantage that they are far from what theSaudis want, but that objection applies to anything that we can offer. Both courseshave merit: (b) maintains the policy so far pursued of insisting that Buraimi isnot the only problem, and that we have grievances against the Saudis that need atleast equally urgent redress. Moreover we can make a small move in this field by offering to promote Buraimi in the order of items. Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador inJedda favours this line. We can also explain that our agenda does not mean thatall the items on it have to be settled in their agreed order; but only that they must bediscussed in that order. The Saudis do not seem to know this, (c) has the meritof meeting part of faisals second point and of constituting an offer of what might be dressed up as a concession.9. There is no reason why we should not combine (b) with (c). (b) alonemight look like deliberate procrastination, but in insisting on continuing to discussthe agenda we could say that when we came to Buraimi we would discussarrangements for Saudi access to the sea and the repatriation of the exiles.10. I have asked Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Jedda for his views, andwill consult my colleagues when I receive them.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W.1,July 16, 1956.
