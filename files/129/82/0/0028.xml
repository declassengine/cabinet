SECRETCP. (56) 17817 th July7795XTHtS IS A COPY. TH  ORIGINAL IS ^RETAINED yfffiB SECTION 3 (4)THE PUByfrfECORDS ACT................ADEN .............--Memoran^um-byJhe^Secretary of State for the colonies circulate the following notes on the present situation in aden Colony and the Aden Protectorate for the information of mycolleagues.I.   general. The British position in Southern Arabia has been assailedin varying degrees by Egypt, the Yemen and Saudi Arabia, three countrieswhich recently concluded a military pact at Jedda.    The forms that theirhostility has taken in recent years in intrigue and subversion and, in thecase of the Yemen, of aggression on the Protectorate frontier, have beenfully reported.    Local action to counteract these hostile moves and to convince the. Colony and Protectorate that their interests will be bestassured by the British connection is not by itself enough.    Vigorousdiplomatic and propaganda measures are vital to relieve this externalpressure.-&apos;. . .3. Much mischief has been caused, especially in the colony and parts of the Protectorate near it, by hostile propaganda in Cairobroadcasts.    This is being met by strengthening the broadcasting fromAden, which could be greatly assisted by co-operation from B.B.C.broadcasts, to which Arabs look as the &quot;Voice of Britain&quot;.II.   PROTECTORATE4. The present frontier between the Aden Protectorate and the yemen is that accepted by Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the^emen bythe treaty of 1934 pending the negotiation of a permanent settlement ofthis question, to be reached before 1974.    The position of the protectorate frontier with Saudi Arabia has been defined unilaterallyby Her Majesty&apos;s Government.    On the Yemen frontier there are some places where its exact position is genuinely in doubt, but an agreement made in 1951 to appoint a Boundary Commission to clear up these doubtshas never been implemented by the Yemen.    Meanwhile, there haveduring recent years been a number of incursions across the border byYemeni tribesmen and sometimes by Yemeni troops, and the Yemeniauthorities have actively fomented discontent in parts of the Protectorateby bribery and subversion and by inciting dissidents by gifts of arms to rebel against local Protectorate Rulers.    Recently these tactics have
changed, and interference has taken the form of encouragement ofindustrial and political discontent inside the Colony and Protectorate,with the result that the Yemen frontier is at present relatively quiet.The Saudi authorities have also lately discontinued the encouragementthat they had been giving to outlying tribesmen in the Eastern aden protectorate by bribery and intrigue to cause trouble in the Protectorate.5. Apart from the R.A.F. stationed at Aden and available inthe Protectorate, the Air Officer Commanding at Aden has under his command, in the Protectorate, the Aden Protectorate Levies recruited from the Protectorate (2,350 all ranks and including 50 British officers).Internal Protectorate security forces also are the Government Guardsin the Western Aden Protectorate (930 all ranks including 10 British and23 Arab officers) and the Hadhrami Bedouin Legion in the Eastern aden protectorate (750 all ranks including 23 Arab officers).    These twoSecurity Forces are under the control of the Governor.    There are aswell local State forces (the Lahej Regular Army, the Mukalla RegularArmy and Tribal Guards) under local Rulers (see also paragraph 12).6. Hostile propaganda has had a degree of success in the morecivilised areas of the Protectorate, and this has been exemplified by anti-British agitation on the part of members of the Jiffri family who areactive members of the local Arab National Congress.    The Jiffris belong to Lahej, the principal State in the Western Aden Protectorate, andare Saiyids.    They are British Protected Persons and their deportationor rustication raises considerable difficulty.    The Lord Chancellor,the Attorney-General and I have recently discussed the best way toproceed with Sir William Luce, who goes out as Governor next month.I can report orally on this.7. Federation of the Protectorate States would bring themeconomic and administrative advantages.    Most of the ProtectorateRulers have agreed to the idea in principle, but some of them, especially those of the smaller States, have misgivings about it, and it is not being pressed.    The Rulers have been left entirely free to negotiate among themselves such form of closer association as may suit them best.8. The Imam of the Yemen has hitherto strongly opposed theprospect of any closer combination between the Aden Protectorate States,as being likely to make his own ultimate absorption of them more difficult.There are now signs that he may encourage a South Arabian Unionindependent of Britain.9. So far no mineral wealth has bees/found in the aden protectorate, but Petroleum Concessions (an associate of the iraq petroleum Company) hold an exploratory licence for oil, and areprospecting in the eastern part of the Eastern Aden Protectorate, which seems to be the most likely part of the country to yield results,Discovery of oil, if it occurs, will present a problem of the equitabledivision of the profits.    The Protectorate is grant-aided, and it wouldbe wrong for part of it (probably the greater part) to remain so whileone or two of the Protectorate States, in which oil is found, wax rich onthe proceeds.    The Governor of Aden has therefore proposed to the rulers that they should accept, before the discovery of oil, agreementswhereby the profits (apart from the Company&apos;s share) will be divided between the States in which oil is found and the other States to financecurrent and new services, and thereby to reduce the amount of the grant-in-aid.    None of the Rulers has yet accepted these agreements in detail,but some have done so in principle.    The Sultan of Qishn and Socotra,
in whose mainland territory there are the best oil prospects, has rejected the agreements;  we have other complaints against the Sultan and independent of his attitude over oil strong action against him has beenconsidered.    It would clearly be inadvisable to take it on the grounds ofhis attitude to the oil proposals.    The Governor asks for authority ifnecessary to give the Sultan formal advice to accept the agreements.The Sultan is bound by his advisory treaty to accept formal advice on all matters, except those concerning Mohammedan religion and customs,provided the advice is in the interests of the State or of the people of theState.    Refusal to accept could be met only by his deposition or by the suspension of his authority over his mainland territory.    I do not proposeto authorise the giving of formal advice unless and until Sir William Lucerecommends it.III.    COLONY10. Aden Colony has during 1956 been the scene of seriousindustrial unrest which has been exploited by political malcontents.A wave of strikes in the spring dislocated the business of the port and,for a time, of the new refinery.    A Commission of Inquiry appointed bythe Governor found that the strikes had legitimate industrial causes.They were, however, fomented and prolonged by political incitement.The genuine grievances of the workers have been met, but unrest continues.Mr. James Young, a former Trades Union official in the United Kingdom,who was a member of the Commission, on which he did most valuablework, is returning to Aden before the end of this month, and will assist in the proper organisation of the Aden trade unions (which are, for themost part, very new and inexperienced bodies) and the improvement ofindustrial relations between them and the employers.11. The internal political situation in Aden Colony has been muchchanged by the emergence of political associations.    The Aden Associationaims at internal self-government for the Colony inside the Commonwealth,but the United National Front and the South Arabian League (now combinedunder the name of an Arab National Congress) are more extreme and workfor an independent South Arabian State, embracing the Protectorate andthe Colony and possibly joining with the Yemen and divorced from any british connection (see also paragraph 6).    At the same time a large part of the Arab population in the Colony of Aden, and also the Indianelement, are conservative but inarticulate, and would gladly see thepresent form of administration continue.    The policy of Her MajestylsGovernment is clearly to encourage the Aden Association against theextreme organisations (whose followers include many Yemenis in Adenwho are not British subjects), by promoting gradual advance, bysafe stages, towards a considerable degree of internal self-government,while preserving British ultimate control.IV.   LAW AND ORDER GENERALLY12, Forces available in the Colony for the maintenance of lawand order are one British battalion (less two companies in Bahrain),two squadrons of the R.A.F. Regiment and the Colony Armed and CivilPolice (strength 260 and 400 respectively).    It has been agreed that a force equivalent to a battalion must be based at Aden.    The system of security intelligence has been reorganised and an Intelligence Centre hasbeen established for the co-ordination of intelligence investigation andfor the collation of information concerning Aden Colony and Protectorate.The Special Branch in the Colony has been strengthened.-   A localIntelligence Committee holds regular meetings and is responsible forweekly and monthly intelligence summaries.
V.   GENERAL13. With proper support the civil and military authorities canhold the situation locally.    The real danger is that the Arabs are constantly being told, and many believe, that we are leaving Aden just as we left Suez.    The Arab thinks with his eyes and is impressed by strength and resolution.    Both in the Colony and the Protectoratethe older generation are well aware of the benefits they have derivedfrom the British connection and, in spite of persistent attempts to undermine our influence and to shake confidence in us, there is still alarge fund of goodwill for the British.    We must see that this is notdissipated and by strength, resolution, justice and sympathy try to convince the younger generation of the economic, material and political advantages of the British connection.   The Arabs in Aden or the protectorate would not really welcome subordination to the Yemen andSaudi Arabia.    We must lose no chance of showing them and their neighbours that we mean to stay in the Colony and retain our influence in the Protectorate,A.L. -B.Colonial Office, S.W.1.16th July, 1956.
