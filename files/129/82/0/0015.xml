OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(56) 165 COPY NO.4th July, 1956.CABINETFEDERATION OF RHODESIA AND NYASALANDMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefc-r Commonwealth RelationsSince 14th June when the Cabinet considered proposals bythe Prime Minister of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland forfurther constitutional advances for the Federation (C, M.(56) 42ndConclusions, Minute 5), the Colonial Secretary and I have had further discussions with Lord Malvern.2. It is likely that when the Gold Coast becomes fully self-governing we are going to be faced with a majority (9 members represent-ing African interests may oppose) request from the Federal Legislatureand the Europeans in the Federation that there shall be a politicaladvance in the status of the Federation.    In my judgment there is noescape from this.3. That being so it is a question of what we can do to meet that demand, having regard to the difficulties in accepting the Federation asa full member of the Commonwealth at this stage of its development,while it is subject to constitutional limitations in respect of the Africansand is not accepted internationally as a sovereign State.4. I think that something on the lines set out in the attached memorandum (Annex) might meet the case.5, In effect the Federation would (subject, of course, to theconsent of other Commonwealth countries) be given a status similar incertain respects to that which Newfoundland occupied as a Dominionuntil the date of its absorption by Canada.    It would not be a full commonwealth member in the sense that it would not be a completelyself-governing member country of the Commonwealth.    But if it had that kind of status it would be able to sit as of right at the Commonwealthtable, enjoy precedence as an equal with other members of the Common-wealth, and achieve this advance in its status before the Gold Coast,Malaya, etc., became full Commonwealth members.6. The position of the Territorial Governments, their obligations and responsibilities in respect of Africans etc,, theobligations and responsibilities of the Colonial Secretary and so ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government in respect of the Northern Territories and my responsibilities under the Federal and Southern Rhodesia Constitutionswould remain unchanged in all respects.7. All this would have to be without prejudice to the mainConstitutional Review of 1960/62 which under the terms of the Act of1953 cannot be ante-dated.    It would be for that Review when it took
place not only to see what amendments were necessary in the constitutionof the Federation but to consider whether matters had reached a point atwhich the present constitutional limitations could be removed so that theFederation could become a fully self-governing member of the Common-wealth internationally recognised as an independent State,8. If, in fact, something on these lines is practicable, it wouldenhance the constitutional status of the Federation, even if it did not give it much else.    It might meet Lord Malvern&apos;s immediate political difficulties and yet be consistent with our obligations to the Africans andto Parliament and the arrangements of 1953.    It is essential to protectthis last point;  some debate in Parliament seems inevitable and it wouldbe highly controversial if we were not in a position to say that we had done so.H.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.I.4th July, 1956.
PROPOSALS FOR ENHANCEMENT OF THE status of THE FEDERATIONIt is clearly not practicable at the present time to recognise the Federation as a fully self-governing member of the Commonwealthwith a status equal in all respects to that of the other members since it is not internally self-governing and is subject to certain substantiallimitations, particularly in respect of the position of Africans both in three component Territories and in the Federation itself.2. That being so the problem to be decided is whether we candevise a status for the Federation which would be sufficiently close tothat of a full Commonwealth member to make it likely that other commonwealth countries would accept the Federation as a Common-wealth member on this basis.3. There is an analogy which could be helpful in this respect,viz., that of Newfoundland.4. Newfoundland, though it did not control its own external relations and did not adopt Clauses 2 - 6 of the Statute of Westminster(see Appendix) had long occupied a constitutional position similar tothat of the other Dominions, it was recognised in the Statute of West-minster as a Dominion, and remained one until it was absorbed by canada in 1949.5. There are two essentials to be ensured in the exercise nowunder consideration.(a) To safeguard the interests of Africans in the territories and in the Federation in terms ofthe pledges that were given in 1953 (seeparagraph 10 below).(b) Not to anticipate the Review of the constitution which under the Constitution of 1953 cannot takeplace earlier than I960, and may take place anytime between I960 and 1962*6. If these desiderata are to be secured, and if political difficulty with the Opposition is to be avoided, any arrangements thatare set up must be such as neither to confer full Commonwealth statusin the sense that it is enjoyed by Canada or Australia, nor in any wayto take away from the full responsibility of the United Kingdom Govern-ment for the protection of African interests.7. My proposals in effect amount to the grant to the Federationof a status similar in many respects to that formerly enjoyed byNewfoundland;  there would be a specific reservation that it would haveno power under its new status to amend the Constitution otherwise, orto any greater extent, than it has at the moment;  and the powers of thecomponent Territories and of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in respect of africans would be completely reserved.
8. I invite my colleagues to consider the following ways in whichthis might be achieved.    EITHER(a) (i)  The Federal Prime Minister to be admitted to futureMeetings of Commonwealth Prime Ministers as of right;(ii) the Federal Government to be formally recognised asa member of the Commonwealth (even though not fullyself-governing) though it would not be acceptedinternationally as a sovereign State;(iii) a greater measure of responsibility for conducting itsexternal relations to be devolved on the Federation;(iv) the Federal Prime Minister to be given right of directaccess to The Queen except in respect of certain matters such as reserved legislation, external affairs and the appointment of the Governor-General.OR(b) As at (a) above and in addition(v) The benefits of Sections 2-6 of the Statute of Westminsterto be extended to the Federal Government, subject tothe reservations that follow.    The effect would be that:(1)  The Federal Government would be given full powers to make laws having extra-territorialoperation.(2) No Act of the United Kingdom Parliament would extend to the Federation unless the Governmentof the Federation requested and consented toits enactment, except Acts of Parliament relatingto African affairs, external relations, matters which are Territorial under the Constitution andthe amendment of the Constitution.(3)  The Colonial Laws Validity Act would not applyexcept in relation to any law made by theFederation in respect of the four exceptionsmentioned in (2) above,9. If either of these alternatives were adopted the position ofthe Territorial Governments would remain precisely as at present.They would continue to enjoy all their present privileges and responsibilities and the control of them by Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould remain unimpaired.    The position of Africans in the territories would continue to be safeguarded to the same extent as atpresent, and, as already explained, corresponding safeguards wouldbe retained in respect of the position of Africans under the federal government.    In particular, the functions of the African Affairs Board,to which Africans attach great importance,would be preserved.    Powerto amend the Constitution, save to the extent and in the manner thatthe Federation already has powers in this regard, would be reserved to the United Kingdom Government.    This need not prejudicially affectthe status of the Federation, for the Statute of Westminster embodiessimilar, though less extensive, reservations in the cases of Canada and australia.
10.        Either of these solutions, if acceptable to the commonwealth prime Ministers, should meet Lord Malvern*s problem.    He is nottroubled about the international aspect.    What he wants is to secure thatthe Federation shall be recognised as a Commonwealth country, withthe right to sit at Prime Ministers&apos; Meetings, preferably before theGold Coast acquires full Commonwealth membership.    The second alternative, with the extension of the benefits of sections (2) to (6)of the Statute of Westminster, would be more impressive.    On the otherhand, it would require legislation, whereas the first could probablybe adopted without more than a single debate in Parliament, possibly on the tabling of a White Paper.Difficulties in any such scheme11. The main difficulties (which are examined in detail below)are:-(a) The pledges given in 1953 to Parliament;(b) Possible reactions on the Territorial Governments ofconceding a wider measure of independence to theFederal Government;(c) Possible Commonwealth reluctance to see anotherNewfoundland;(d) The probable consequent much greater delay beforethe Federation could become an independent commonwealth country in the full sense.(e) Repercussions elsewhere in the Colonial Empire;and in the case of the second alternative only,(f) Objections to extending the benefit of Sections 2-of the Statute of Westminster to the Federation.(A)  The Pledges12, These clearly contemplate that the &quot;desire&quot; of the people ofthe Territories shall have been expressed beforethe Federation moveson to Commonwealth status.    The Preamble says:-&quot;and whereas the association .... in a Federation wouldfoster partnership and co-operation between theirinhabitants and enable the Federation, when thoseinhabitants so desire, to go forward with confidencetowards the attainment of full membership of theCommonwealth .. .. &quot;Lord Chandos in Parliament said:-unless the majority of the people so desire it ...nothing short of that will enable any Government to approach a scheme of amalgamation or of a statuswhich will end in Dominion status without the agreementof the inhabitants.    I give a categorical assurance about that. &quot;
13,        But need these pledges be construed as operating to preventour proceeding as proposed?    Since:(a) we should be confirming the full United Kingdomprotection for Africans which it was their object to ensure;     and(b) we should not be conferring full commonwealth membership on the Federation.14.        It would be necessary to reassure the Territories thatthe arrangements proposed did not place them at a greater disadvantage in relation to the Federation than they are at the present time.    Thiswould be difficult, if not impossible, unless on their side FederalMinisters were prepared in their public references to the arrangements,to make it quite clear that they accepted the present distribution ofpowers between the Federal and Territorial Governments and the presentsafeguards for Africans should remain unaltered.    It would be moredifficult if Sections 2-6 of the Statute of Westminster were extended tothe Federation than if they were not.(b)  Commonwealth attitude to another &quot;Newfoundland&quot;15.        (i)  The new Dominions might suspect that the object wasto devise an inferior status for new members and that the Gold Coastetc., would be given no more than the Federation was to receive.Need this necessarily give trouble?    It would be madeperfectly clear that while the Federation was not receiving that fullinternational position that the Gold Coast would get, that had not been an obstacle to Newfoundland being accepted as a Dominion;  and that itwas only because of the reserved powers in respect of Africans, whichcould not be relaxed at this stage, that the problems of the Federationwere being handled in this way.(ii)  Pandit Nehru might take the line that what in effect thePrime Ministers were being asked to accept, was a multi-racialcommunity run by a tiny minority of Europeans,    The answer could bethat we were continuing to give the fullest protection to the African,But this point if pressed by Pandit Nehru, might well be a very controversial one round the table.(iii) The &quot;old&quot; Dominions might regard a dilution of theCommonwealth concept as being involved.But after all, the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, and thereafter of the Federation, has been accepted at their Meetings fortwenty years.    And one would expect them all to be sympathetic to theambitions of the Federation and Mr. Strijdom in particular strongly to favour securing its position on the Commonwealth List.(iv) The Federation could not achieve full membership until,in terms of the Preamble, the inhabitants &quot;so desire&quot;.    But it could berepresented that the status of a member of the Commonwealth could,as in the case of Newfoundland, be conceded to the Federation withinthe Commonwealth, even though the Federation continued subject tolimitations in respect of Africans and of foreign affairs, and itscomponent parts retained their present status.    Commonwealth countriesaccepted Newfoundland as a Dominion even though she did not choose toadopt the powers conferred by Sections 2-6 of theStatute of Westminster,
Admittedly the concept of Commonwealth membership has developedconsiderably since the Statute of Westminster, and Dominion Status in1931 denoted less than full Commonwealth membership does today.(C) Effect on pace of Constitutional progress ofthe Federation16.        These arrangements may well postpone full membership ofthe Commonwealth for the Federation, and they would affirm the powersof the Territorial Governments within the Federation.    But they wouldseem to us to meet Lord Malvern (who would, it seems, be prepared topay that price) in his desire to get the Federation into commonwealth membership before or with the Gold Coast.    Moreover, they would reduce the risk of a split inside the Federation (particularly importantnow that we are committed to very heavy Kariba expenditure), or of ahead-on collision between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the intransigentwhite element;  and yet would protect the Africans.17,        Equally, it has to be accepted that there could be no question for a long time to come of reducing the number of governmental units in the Federation and Lord Malvern has made it quite clear that he is notconsidering or proposing &quot;amalgamation&quot; in any form.(D) Need there be awkward repercussions elsewhere inthe Colonial Empire ?18,        The importance of this is obvious.    It would be embarrassingfor Her Majesty&apos;s Government to be faced with a demand that they should retain corresponding responsibilities, e.g. in the Gold Coast for theAshanti or the Northern Chiefs.    It would be equally embarrassing if either the Nigerian Federation as a whole or, as is more probable, theWestern and Eastern Regional Governments, after they have attainedtheir independence in regional matters, were, on the basis of the precedent which would be created, to demand Commonwealth membership.But it is arguable that the position of the Federation is unique.    It is a combination of a Territory which was a half Dominion which could notunfairly have claimed membership of the Commonwealth in its own right had the Federation not come into being - and of two Protectorates.All three areas have for a great many years had separate, and indeeddifferent political and governmental systems.    They are not sectionsof a single territory which has hitherto been governed as such.(E) Difficulties over conceding the powers in Sections2-6 of the Statute of Westminster19.        Sections 5 and 6 of the Statute of Westminster which deal withshipping are of no practical importance in the present connection.    Itis Sections, 2, 3, and 4 the effect of conceding which is set out inparagraph 8(b) above, that are of constitutional significance.With the reservations proposed in paragraph 8(b) above,I do not think there is any danger in applying these sections, and thepolitical value to the Federal Government of doing so is obvious.
H.July, 1956.20.        I suggest that we consider the adoption of the first alternative,provided this satisfies Lord Malvern and is acceptable in principle toother Commonwealth Governments.    This would have the advantage of avoiding legislation and should make the proposal less difficult to handlein Parliament and in the Northern Territories.    If Lord Malvern doesnot consider that the first alternative would meet his political difficulties,or if any of the other Commonwealth Prime Ministers consider that theFederation should not be given membership of the Commonwealthwithout legislation to confer the limited Statute of Westminster powersmentioned in paragraph 8 above, I would recommend that we should beprepared to consider adopting the second alternative with the limitedStatute of Westminster powers.    This would require further careful examination and we should do no more than obtain the agreement inprinciple of Commonwealth Prime Ministers to such an arrangementif, after further examination, it should be found to be practicable.
