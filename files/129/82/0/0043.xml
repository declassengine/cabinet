secret.P. (56) 193 COPY NO,27th July, 1956.CABINETFILM policy memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Economic Policy Committee have been considering what our future policy should be regarding assistance to the film productionindustry in this country,2.     At present such assistance is given in three ways:-(a) Through a quota system, under which cinemas have toshow 30 per cent first feature and 25 per cent secondfeature British films.     This ensures a home marketbut does not in itself ensure that British films aremade.    Present legislation runs out in 1958.(b) Through the National Film Finance Corporation, which provides risk capital to the industry (mainly to independent producers outside the big cinema-owningcombines of Ranks and Associated British PicturesCorporation) which is not available from privatesources.    The Corporation^ loan-making powers will expire next March.(c) Through the British Film Production Fund, which is derived from a voluntary levy on the film exhibitorswho set aside part .of their gross receipts (much ofwhich come from.American films) to the extent ofabout  21 millions a year for the benefit cf UnitedKingdom film producers.3.     It is arguable that with the advent of television the claims of theBritish film industry for assistance on the score of national prestige or ofthe industry&apos;s cultural importance are not what they were.    On the otherhand, although the cinema is giving ground to television, this does notappear so far to be affecting the better cinemas and has not yet had any significant effect on the revenue from entertainment duty.    Withdrawalof assistance would lead to a steep reduction in British first featurefilms to, say, about one-third of the present 60 to 70 produced annually,and quite apart from the strong criticism which would be levelled at us from those who believed in the importance of this home industry, weshould have to face a loss of some  7-8 millions of foreign exchange dueto loss of exports and the need to import more American films.    these considerations may not hold good indefinitely, but the Economic PolicyCommittee have concluded that for some years to come at any rate itwould not be possible for the Government to disengage itself from the affairs of this industry.
4.     To protect the industry by means of a tariff is not a practicableproposition because of the international complications which it would cause and the technical difficulties involved.    Nor in presentcircumstances ought we to contemplate a direct subsidy.    We are left,therefore, with the three existing means referred to above.    TheEconomic Policy Committee are therefore agreed that legislation shouldbe introduced in the 1957/58 session to renew the statutory film quotaand that a Bill will be needed in the next session to extend the loan-makingpowers of the National Film Finance Corporation: provision is madefor this in the lists attached to C.P,(56) 162.    Such legislation wouldhave to reconstitute the Corporation^ capital structure by writing offsome  3. 7 millions of public money loaned to it over the past seven years, which is now irrecoverable.    No further public money would,however, be put into the Corporation which would be required to makedo with its remaining loan capital of  2.3 millions advanced by the Boardof Trade, and the further resources up to  2 millions which theCorporation has power to raise from private sources.    The tougherlending policy which would be required of the Corporation would involve some loss of film production.5.     The real problem centres round the future of the British film production Fund.    This is essential to the continuance of anything likethe present level of film production and without it the position of theFinance Corporation would become hopelessly insecure; but theexhibitors have made it clear that nothing short of a substantial reduction of entertainment duty would induce them to continue the fundat its present level on a voluntary basis.    The President of the Boardof Trade and I are not in favour of engaging in such bargaining, whichmight have no limit and which would put at risk the very large sum of 30- 40 millions which the Exchequer now derives from entertainmentduty on films.    We therefore favour the possibility of giving statutoryeffect to the arrangements already in force on a voluntary basis.Collection by the Customs as agents and distribution by the Fundmachinery in proportion to the box office earnings of films would thenbe retained, but given statutory form.    Such an arrangement would notremove the pressure for a reduction in entertainment duty, butexhibitors would not have the bargaining power which they would possessif the Fund were to be continued on a voluntary basis.6,      Any such Bill would be bound to be contentious.    The exhibitorswould regard such a statutory levy as an unjustified burden in additionto entertainments duty, and it would not be easy to agree on the correctsum to be transferred from the exhibitors to British producers or how this should be levied on different categories of cinema seats.    several of our colleagues on the Economic Policy Committee are thereforedisturbed at the prospect of such a Bill (which would in addition have to write off  3.7 millions of public money previously loaned to the national film Finance Corporation) and would prefer to limit the Governmenfsundertaking to a renewal of the quota and the Finance Corporation^loan-making powers, and to explore further the possibility of continuing the present voluntary contribution on the part of the exhibitors to theBritish Film Production Fund.    For the reasons which I have already given, the President of the Board of Trade and I doubt whether such negotiations can be profitable.    Nor do we believe that it would be wise to leave open at this stage the future form which the British film production Fund should take while committing ourselves to the continuanceof assistance to the film industry through such a Fund.
7.     V/e must, therefore, ask the Cabinet to determine whether ornot legislative action should be taken to introduce a statutory levy onthe film industry for, say, the next 10 years, to replace the presentvoluntary levy.    A decision on this difficult question cannot be deferredsince, in view of the length of time needed to complete a film, thePresident of the Board of Trade must in fairness to the British producersannounce before the recess the Governmenfs decision regarding futuresupport for the industry.H.M.Treasury Chambers,  S.W.I.27th July, 1956.
