DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(56) 187 COPY20th July, 1956.CABINETBUILDING control memorandum by the Minister of works the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ paper C.P. (56) 166 sets out a tentative case for building control.2. I fully appreciate the Chancellor&apos;s aims and his wish to examineevery possible method of attaining them in the present economic situation:nevertheless, as my Department had the experience of operating thewhole machinery of building control between 1940 and 1954, I feel I mustset out the arguments, which in my opinion are powerful, against such control, whether as a contribution towards solving our immediate problemsor as a long-term feature of our economy.3. The general arguments against any system of building control are as follows:(a) Building licensing can be applied only to a comparatively small part of the work of the construction industries.About a third of this work is maintenance, and controlover maintenance would be almost impossible to justify.Some 55 per cent of the new work of the building industryis carried out on behalf of the Central Government, thelocal authorities, or the nationalised industries.    TheGovernment already have direct control ever most ofthis investment and indirect control over the remainder.Licensing would not apply to it and is therefore irrevelantto the question whether more or less should be done.    Weare therefore left, out of a total building output of 1, 800 millions, with about  500 millions&apos; worth of workin the private sector which might be covered by a schemeof licensing.    The vast bulk of this would have to beallowed to continue either because it was beneath the setlimit of cost, or because, by peace-time standards, itwould have to be regarded as necessary work - privateenterprise housing alone accounts for over  200 millions.(b) Within this limited section of the industry it would be extremely difficult to distinguish between the conflictingclaims of a great proportion of this work.    In war timetwhen there was a clear-cut objective, a simplecriterion existed for what was necessary and what couldbe dispensed with.    In peace time this is not so.There would be great difficulty in deciding whether oneindustry more than another, or one firm more than another,deserved to be allowed to carry out new building: nor could we regard all office building as non-productive.
You cannot turn building activity off and on like a tap.Unless there is a widespread breaking of contracts,bringing in its train all the difficulties of compensation,etc. licensing can only bite on the schemes not yet started.If the control was limited to the bigger jobs, say over 100, 000, its effect would not be felt for about eighteen months.    If quick results were wanted it would benecessary to apply the control to the smallest jobs.Moreover, if the effects of this policy turned out to bemore violent than the public interest required it wouldbe virtually impossible to reverse the process undermany months.The formidable apparatus of control which the LabourParty found necessary was not in fact ever usedeffectively to control in peace time the volume of building.The procedure was to prepare every year an estimate ofthe total potential output of the building industry and toapportion this estimate between the various claimants for building work.    It was in effect an allocation of the outputof the industry on the basis of a system of priorities andnot a restriction of the total output of the building industry which is what the Chancellor appears to have in mind.If the output of the industry was to be restricted bylicensing it would mean a deliberate creation of un-employment in the building and civil engineering industriesnot by a general economic policy but by the direct with-holding of licences.    I cannot exaggerate the dangerousconsequences of such a policy which, it seems to me,would bring the risk of a head-on collision between theGovernment and the representatives of very large,widespread industries.Whether or not the control was used effectively to limitbuilding work, there is no doubt that the results for theefficiency of the building and the building materialsindustries would be harmful in the extreme.    Highproductivity depends upon employers and operativesbeing able to feel reasonably certain about future demand on the basis of their own forecasts.    The inevitable result of the Government taking control would be a lossof confidence and a consequent drop in productivity.We have had experience of the difficulty of revivingindustries damaged as result of political action - forinstance the brick industry when we came into office.The Chancellor sees in the control of building, a controlalso over the tools, equipment, etc. that go into a building.I am not sure to what extent this is in fact valid.Industrialists would in fact install new equipment in oldbuildings if they could not put it - with greater efficiency -into new buildings.More civil servants would have to be taken on - at least300 in my own Department, as well as a number in otherDepartments - to administer the control.
(i)      Finally, we should be re-creating a whole series ofdreary offences for actions which no-one would regard as morally reprehensible - the kind of offences which itwas hoped were going for ever as the War and Socialistpolicies receded: and with them all the unpopular apparatuswhich we have always denounced, for detecting and provingthem.4. These are arguments against building control in general when-ever it might be introduced.    Assuming, however, that it would be an effective control, there is the question whether the present outlook shows a need for it.    On the same day as the Chancellor-&apos;s paper appeared, theFinancial Times pointed out that a big fall had taken place in the numberof industrial building schemes which received location approval duringthe second quarter of this year, and that leading contractos companies had experienced a big fall in the number of enquiries received for themain types of work.    This agrees with the information which I am myselfreceiving from contractors and others in the industry.    The effect of the credit squeeze on the building and civil engineering industries was boundto be delayed.    It was never expected that any appreciable reduction in its work would be achieved before the autumn.    The signs are that this reduction is in sight.5. Finally, there are formidable political arguments againstbuilding control being adopted by the Conservative Party;  these cannotbe dismissed as purely &quot;doctrinaire1.    The whole theme of our policy since 1945 has been that we should free ourselves from physicalcontrols and that it is by other policies that we should overcome our economic difficulties.    To impose a building control would be not onlya retreat from our belief in a free economy, but would be seen by both our supporters and our opponents alike as such.    I think that it wouldcast a doubt on the sincerity of our beliefs and motives not only in thisbut in other fields.6. The Chancellor asks that for the present his colleagues should avoid taking up firm positions in public for or against.    Is this possible?I fear that after our election promises, and statements made since, anyequivocal comments will ba taken to mean that licensing is to be re-introduced.    The consequences are certain to be that everyonecontemplating building work will do all he can to start before thenecessary, legislation - highly controversial on our side - can be passed.The effects of the credit squeeze will be to that extent counterbalancedand the disinflationary movement checked.P.B. -H.Ministry of Works, S.E.1.20th July, 1956,
