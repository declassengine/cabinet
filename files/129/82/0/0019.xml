Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1956Copy No.CABINETMALTA: OUTCOME OF FINANCIAL TALKSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies as my colleagues are aware, I concluded my statement in the House on29th June, by announcing that I had conveyed to the Maltese Government an offer to provide assistance of  1\ millions to cover a period of 18 months fromlast April, coupled with the proposal that a Commission, appointed by the UnitedKingdom, should conduct a further investigation into Malta&apos;s financial needs and resources. This I had been authorised to do by the Cabinet on the previous day(CM. (56) 46th Conclusions, Minute 8).Maltese Governments Reactions2. As a result of this proposal, the Prime Minister of Malta withdrew hisdemand for acceptance or rejection by Her Majesty&apos;s Government of a proposalinvolving United Kingdom aid at the rate of  6^- 7 millions for this financial yearand announced that he has resumed negotiations with Her Majesty&apos;s Government.3. My colleagues should, however, be aware that Mr. Mintoff is seeking toimpose conditions about the appointment of the Commission, which are now underconsideration.Other Points of Conflict4. Even if the negotiations are successful and the present financial crisis isaverted, there is a possibility that conflict with the Maltese Government may shortly be resumed on other issues. The main points of probable conflict in the futureare as follows:  (i) The principle of economic &quot; equivalence &quot;The members of the Conference cannot deny that they cast considerable doubt on the validity of this principle or of the economic reasoning on whichit was based by the Maltese Government and its advisers. In all his recentpublic statements, however, Mr. Mintoff has reiterated his attachment tothis demand.(ii) The Maltese electoral systemMr. Mintoff told the Round Table Conference that he wanted a change from the present Maltese electoral system of proportional representation (for elections to the Maltese Legislative Assembly) to the British system, even beforeintegration took place. The reasons he gave were the disadvantages of proportional representation and the desirability of uniformity of thesystem of election which would, of course, apply to the election ofrepresentatives at Westminster. His real reason, however, is probably that thechange to the British system would probably increase his Party&apos;s representation in the Maltese Legislative Assembly, possibly giving him the two-thirds majority without which the present Maltese Constitution cannot be amendedexcept by Act of the United Kingdom Parliament or prerogative instrument.50172SECRETCP. (56) 16913th JulyK 1956
He has not yet publicly declared his desire for this change to take place beforethe next General Election in Malta, which is to decide on integration, against which the Maltese Opposition have already made representations to me. Iconsider that their representations are justified, since the Maltese people shouldbe given an opportunity of demonstrating their views. If Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment accept Mr. Mintoffs proposal, they would be exposed to thecharge that they were in effect trying to bring about integration by unfairmeans. For it appears that if Mr. Mintoff maintains his total vote, he wouldunder the British system obtain 35 seats to the Opposition^ 5 instead of thepresent ratio of 23 to 17. I am therefore of the opinion that, if Mr. Mintoffpresses this proposal, it should be resisted by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.(iii) Methods of consultation with Her Majesty&apos;s GovernmentThe evidence of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to the Conference and theReport laid great stress on the need for increased and improved consultationat all levels between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the Maltese Government.In fact, there has been a fairly regular process of informal consultation, even under the present Constitution, since Mr. Mintoff took office and although there have been some difficulties, relations between the Maltese Governmentand Maltese Imperial Government have been better than for many years past.These relations promised well for the experiment of integration. Mr. Mintoffsrecent tactics throw some doubt, however, on their ability or willingness to use the processes of consultation in the spirit or manner envisaged in the Report.Arguments in favour of Integration5. My colleagues will recall that the 111 ct 1II ai guments in favour of integrationwere as follows:  (a) The advent of nuclear weapons had not substantially changed theimportance of Malta in our defence plans.(b) The proposals of the Nationalist Party for a form of Dominion status didnot offer sufficient safeguards for Her Majesty&apos;s Governments defence interests in Malta.(c) Constitutional and administrative reforms short of a form of dominion status or representation at Westminster would not satisfy the Maltese people and would not create the spirit of co-operation necessary tofacilitate Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs free exercise of their responsibilities in Defence and Foreign Affairs.(d) The plan of integration as proposed by the Conference appeared to offer the best chance of securing Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs interests and ensuring a happier and more successful political and economicrelationship between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and Malta in thefuture.Changes in the Position6. As my colleagues know, Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs acceptance of theReport of the Conference was welcomed on all sides of the House and by the maltese Government. But, as indicated above. Mr. Mintoffs recent actions and theprobable recurrence of conflicts on other aspects of the Report of the RoundTable Conference may be indications that the implementation of integration may give rise to serious friction in the near future if not in the long run. The reasonfor this may be found primarily in Mr. Mintoffs erratic and intemperate character,but he may have reached the conclusion that, once the scheme of integrationrecommended by the Conference is put into effect, he will have to settle down toa long period of patient and careful administration, involving many domesticdifficulties. Among these would be the state of his relations with the roman catholic Church in Malta and the difficulty of maintaining the support of the malta Labour Party for a policy of wage restraint and of raising living standardsonly in relation to improvements in Malta&apos;s economic capacity. He will thus beplaced on the defensive and will have no dynamic policies with which to counterinevitable criticisms from the Opposition in Malta. His present tactics may,therefore, be based on an attempt to outbid the Opposition in nationalistic gesturesand so possibly even capture some of their followers. It is consistent with thisview that Mr. Mintoff keeps talking of &quot; an alternative solution &quot; on the lines
of our arrangement with Libya. It will be recalled that these involve an agreement on the use of defence facilities by Her Majesty&apos;s Government, certain assistancein the development of Libya&apos;s defence, and a separate financial arrangement bywhich Her Majesty&apos;s Government provides money towards Libya&apos;s economic development.conclusion.  I draw two conclusions from this:  (1) Whatever may be Mr. Mintoff&apos;s motives in pursuing his present tactics,Lconsider that Her Majesty&apos;s Government must not expose themselvesto further pressure from the Maltese Government and must, ifnecessary, be prepared to risk Mr. Mintoff throwing in his hand, evenif it endangers the implementation of the Report of the Round table conference. I still hope that the difficulties can be overcome and thatthe plan, which still offers the best prospect of a successful relationship between Malta and the United Kingdom, can be made to work. Butwe cannot have Mr. Mintoff setting conditions which we are committed to accept.(2) We must have an alternative policy ready in case the integration planbreaks down. It may be assumed that full integration in the sense ofmaking Malta another county of the United Kingdom would be ruled out by the Maltese themselves irrespective of any objections on our part. It may also be assumed that, failing implementation of the present form of integration, the Maltese people would accept either the quasi-Dominion status advocated by the Maltese Nationalist Party or a&quot; Libyan solution.&quot; If, however, the assumption about Malta&apos;scontinued strategic importance is still valid, it would seem to follow that neither the alternative proposed by the Maltese Nationalist Partynor a fortiori a solution granting independence on the Libyan or anotherpattern would meet Her Majesty&apos;s Governments defence requirements.The only other obvious solution would be a return to a form of Crowncolony government. This would certainly not be acceptable to the maltese people for long nor would it be easier to work than integrationunder Mr. Mintoff.recommendation. In order to form our views more clearly, I suggest that we should, as a first step, ask the Chiefs of Staff for a reassessment of Malta&apos;s importance as a base in the light of any recent changes in our Defence requirements. We should alsoask them for their views on the implications, for our defence needs, of allowing a situation to develop in which we might be confronted with the need to find analternative solution.A.
