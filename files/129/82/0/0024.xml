CX^e^JiojLL^t      (1.1- ^loSECRETC.P. (56) 174 COPY NO. ^11th July, 1956.CABINETPOLICE pay memorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department and Minister for Welsh affairs have circulated separately a paper on legislation to make it possible in the future for police pay awards to have retrospective effectwhere appropriate.    This paper deals with the demand, for which thereis strong support on both sides of the House of Commons, that special steps should be taken to enable retrospective effect to be given to the payaward made to the police in December, 1955.    This also would require legislation.2.       A meeting of Ministers under the Chairmanship of the Lord Privy-Seal considered this question and decided that retrospection ought not tobe given on the December award.    Subsequently, with the approval of theCabinet, I replied to Questions in the House of Commons to the effectthat the Government were not prepared to introduce legislation for thepurpose (C,M.(56) 47th Conclusions, Minute 6).    The reasons why we came to the conclusion we did on that point were:(a) It has not been possible to give retrospective effect topast awards because of the legal difficulty and the policewere well aware of this during all the negotiations.It was specifically pointed out to the police and thearbitrators that a recommendation for retrospectioncould have no effect.    The object of having recourse to arbitration was simply to bring pressure to bear onthe Government to amend the law;(b) the total cost of granting retrospection for the period from September to December last, which the arbitratorssaid would be right on merits if it were legally possible,would be about  2 millions for England, Wales and Scotland,half of which would fall on the Exchequer.    This would be embarrassing at a time when the Chancellor of the exchequer was trying to make all possible economies.    It would almost certainly have repercussive effects on the recent teachers&apos;award and there did not seem to be any strong case forincurring these embarrassments to improve what was already a generous award;(c) if retrospection were given on this award it could hardly be denied in any future case, and in effect thegeneral principle would be given away before theCabinet had decided on future policy.JA.
3.       But for these difficulties it would, of course, be desirable thatthe police should have the full benefit of the award made by the arbitratorsfrom September last.    It is, however, necessary to consider also theposition of the police authorities, who bear half the cost.    They haveexpressed themselves as in favour of retrospection for the future, butthey rejected the claim for retrospection in respect of the Decemberaward on the ground that it was not possible to give effect to it.    It is far from certain that they would be in favour of giving retrospection onthe last award.    If the Government decided to take any such step without consulting the local authority associations there would undoubtedly betrouble with them.    They have already protested bitterly because theGovernment, under pressure in Committee Stage of the Pensions (increase)Bill, gave way on certain widows pensions without the local authoritieshaving an opportunity of expressing their views.4.        This is a very difficult matter.    There is undoubtedly a very strong feeling among the police, to which vehement expression is being given by the men&apos;s representatives, that they are being cheated of theirdue and that it is merely the parsimony of the Central Government whichis responsible and they claim to know that the local authorities would beprepared to pay their share.    To allow disquiet and distrust to grow amongthe police service is a very serious matter, especially at a time whenthe service is undermanned.    Parliament is particularly inclined tosympathise with the police at a time when there is so much talk about theheavy responsibilities and the dangers attendant on service in the police.5.       Nevertheless, I think it would be pessimi exempli to give way to pressure, especially after the Government have announced that they arenot prepared to introduce the legislation which would be necessary to giveeffect to the December award;  and unless the Cabinet are advised that-the pressure would be irresistible I think that we should refuse to alter thedecision which I have already announced on behalf of the Government.6.       Should the Cabinet decide that there ought to be a concession tothe demand, it is most important that the local authority associationsshould be consulted before any announcement is made.    I strongly recommend that if it should be decided that retrospection should be givenin respect of the December award, the matter should be dealt with in aBill dealing with the principle of retrospection.G, LLi. -G.Home Office, S.W.1.11th July, 1956.
