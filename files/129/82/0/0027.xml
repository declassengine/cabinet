The report has been prepared by the Ministerial Committee on farm price Review under my chairmanship.Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1956SECRETCP. (56) 17717 th July, 1956CABINETH.

LONG-TERM ASSURANCES FOR HOME AGRICULTUREReport from Ministerial Committee on the Farm Price ReviewGovernment undertaking the Government included the following statement in the Annual review white Paper, 1956 (Cmd. 9721, paragraph 36):-&quot; 36. The Government recognise that each Annual Review by its naturecan afford assurance for only a comparatively short time ahead and that,if longer-term assurances could be made more effective, this would help theindustry in its forward planning. Accordingly they will consider whether any practicable methods of providing such assurances of support for theindustry can be devised.&quot;The terms of the Government^ general obligation to the industry under the agriculture Act, 1947, Section 1 (1) are set out in Appendix I.2. We have been considering various proposals and we now need to giveofficials instructions for discussions with the Farmers&apos; Unions arranged for thelast week in July and to be resumed in the latter part of September.The Proposals3. Our basic objective is to give greater assurance to farmers for the next four or five years, whilst avoiding so far as possible the pressures which have beena feature of recent Annual Reviews. The Agricultural Ministers propose for thispurpose that we should be ready to offer the farmers a &quot; package deal&quot;consisting of:  (i) a guarantee about the general level of support for the industry, whichcould take the form of either:  (a) as the Agricultural Ministers would propose, undertaking tomaintain the total value of the guarantees unchanged each year as long as the net income of the whole industry fell within apredetermined range, which might be  300 millions to  340millions for the first five years, but to hold an Annual Reviewto consider adjustment of the total if net income fell belowthis range or rose above it; or(b) undertaking to. make good or a predetermined proportion, say80 per cent., of increased costs each year, after making an allowance say  10 millions on account of increasing efficiency in the industry;(ii) an undertaking that the guaranteed prices for commodities would in any year be at least x per cent, (say 96 or 97 per cent.) of the guaranteed price for the previous year;(iii) a new scheme of grants for capital improvements (primarily for land and buildings) costing up to, say,  10 millions a year over a substantialperiod, say 10 years.4. We are all agreed that the second and third parts of the proposal could resonably be offered to farmers without involving undue risks to the Exchequeror having undesirable repercussions on our existing or potential overseas tradecommitments. But the first part presents greater difficulty. This is partly becauseof the problem of reconciling any fresh commitment related to support for home agriculture as a whole with any new commitments into which we might wish toenter as a result of trade talks with the Commonwealth and a new trade initiative in Europe, and partly because, although the alternative bases (a) and (b) above arethe best that can be found, both have substantial disadvantages.Home and International Policy5. We have undertaken at least to consider whether more effective long-term assurances can be given to our own farmers. It is most important that we shouldend the discussions with an offer which, even if it is not acceptable to the farmers,50187
is good enough to be politically defensible. The Agricultural Ministers feel thatwe must be prepared to accept, as part of such an offer, an undertaking related tothe total level of support.6. The adoption of such an undertaking would leave us little room for manoeuvre in regard to home agricultural policy during the next four or five years.But if we are to retain the bulk of our Commonwealth preferences and to negotiatesuccessfully with Europe, we may be forced to try to increase our consumption of commonwealth agricultural products. This might be extremely difficult withoutadjustment of our own domestic agricultural policies. On the other hand, theAgricultural Ministers see no way in which we could reduce our home agriculturaloutput sufficiently to meet the Commonwealth problem without such a drasticalteration in our agricultural policy as would be politically impossible.7. If therefore, as the Agricultural Ministers feel to be unavoidable, we mustbe prepared to accept an undertaking related to the total level of support for home agriculture, the question of timing will be important. Any announcement of definite proposals to give fuller assurances to home agriculture would need to become-ordinated with the progress of the European and Commonwealth talks. Wemay need, therefore, to avoid making any final offer to the Unions until thesituation with regard to these talks has been further clarified. In the meantime,however, we must start the discussions. These will in any case be difficult: ifembarrassment is to be avoided, officials must begin with clear instructions as tothe kind of eventual offer they should have in mind.Form of any General Assurance8. The alternative undertakings proposed for the general assurances relateto a range of net income and to partial recoupment of cost changes respectively.The first has the advantage of taking account of all factors affecting the income ofthe industry and not only of costs; but it is open to the objection that we shouldbe giving an implied undertaking to maintain within a range the income of aparticular industry, at any rate for five years, and to do this whatever happened to the output of the industry. On the other hand this is in practice already a majorconsideration in determining the level of agricultural support each year and in presenting it we would have to say that we were now giving precision to thatpractice.9. The second proposal would give precision to the other major consideration in present practice cost changes from year to year. It avoids any undertaking tomaintain the income of the industry, but might appeal to the individual farmerwho is cost-conscious. On the other hand it may be open to criticism as appearing to be a partial cost-plus system.10. Other relevant points of comparison are that the cost change formulaalthough easier to understand is more rigid than the range of net income idea; thatit might be rather more expensive if there were a significant change in the economic climate, with falling prices and costs, unless the complication were added ofqualifying the formula so as to take account of Exchequer cost; and that whileboth involve difficulties about the interpretation of statistics or incorporation instatutory provisions, these may be rather less acute on a net income formula.Decisions Required11.  We ask the Cabinet to decide (i) that minimum commodity guarantees should be offered to the farmers,coupled with a capital improvements scheme to cost up to, say, 10 millions a year over, say, 10 years (paragraph 3 (ii) and (iii));(ii) whether our eventual offer should also include an undertaking related to the total value of support to the industry;(iii) if so, whether this undertaking should be (a) in terms of a guarantee of a range of net income (paragraph 3(i) (a)), or(b) in terms of the recoupment of a proportion of costs (paragraph 3 (i)(b));(iv) the terms of the necessary directive to officials for the July discussions onthe basis of the draft in Appendix II.
APPENDIX IAGRICULTURE ACT, 1947Bart IGuaranteed Prices and Assured Markets1. (1) The following provisions of this Part of this Act shall have effect forthe purpose of promoting and maintaining, by the provision of guaranteed prices and assured markets for the produce mentioned in the First Schedule of this Act,a stable and efficient agricultural industry capable of producing such part of thenation&apos;s food and other agricultural produce as in the national interest it is desirableto produce in the United Kingdom, and of producing it at minimum pricesconsistently with proper remuneration and living conditions for farmers and workers in agriculture and an adequate return on capital invested in the industry.APPENDIX ii draft DIRECTIVE TO OFFICIALSFor the purpose of the forthcoming discussions with the Farmers&apos; Unions,officials of the Agricultural Departments should have as their objective an eventualoffer from the Government of assurances in the form of a package deal which mightcomprise the following:  (i) an undertaking relating to the minimum level of the guarantees for each individual commodity;(ii) a scheme of grants for capital improvements;(iii) an undertaking relating to the total value of support for agriculture.2. For the undertaking (iii) related to the total value of support, the objectiveshould be a proposal based on the principle that variations in the total value of the guarantees should depend (according to the Cabinet&apos;s decision on these alternatives)[on whether or not the net income of the industry falls within a predeterminedrange] [on a sharing between the Government and the industry of the effects of cost changes with an allowance for the increasing efficiency of the industry].3. For the forward guarantees on individual commodities&apos; the objective shouldbe an undertaking to maintain the guaranteed price of any commodity at a figure which would be at least x per cent, (say, 96 per cent, or 97 per cent.) of the guaranteed price for the preceding year.12th July, 1956.
