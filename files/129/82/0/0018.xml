&apos;&apos; *MaSECRET)ZC.P.(56) 168! c rr.Dv ,N4th July, 1956t COPY. THE ORK$T&amp;Nfe^ D UNDER SECTION 3-(4) british BASES IN CEYLONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations and the Minister of defence the Prime Minister of Ceylon has discussed with us his wishto fulfil his election pledge that British &quot;bases&quot; as such should cease to exist in Ceylon.    He has made it clear that his Government do not wishto break the ties between Ceylon and the United Kingdom or to abrogatethe Defence Agreement of 1947 (a document in extremely general terms,which has been of very limited value)i and are ready to let us haye in ceylon the facilities we need, on the understanding that they willlhavebeen made available by Ceylon and are not held by the United Kingdom asa right.    He has also indicated his intention to continue to look to theUnited Kingdom for support and assistance in developing and expanding the Armed Forces of Ceylon. ; \2. The United Kingdom no longer needs to retain all the defenceinstallations which it now holds in Ceylon.    In particular, we wish tomake substantial reductions in the Naval base at Trincomalee.    nor do we consider it necessary to retain as an R.A.F. station the airfield at Katunayake, so long as we continue to enjoy over-flying rights andstaging facilities.3. The result of our discussions is set out in the attached document which is intended for publication.    We would draw attention to tfyefollowing points:-(a) Under Clause 2, the United Kingdom agrees to transfer the Naval Base at Trincomalee and the R.A.F. station at Katunayake to the Government of Ceylon.   The timing of the transfer, and the financial arrangementsassociated with it, are to be the subject of mutual    -agreement.    The acceptance of the principle of transferis, however, unqualified.    Mr. Bandanaraike attachesparticular importance to this for political reasons.  ;(b) Under Clause 5, the Ceylon Government states that itis prepared to grant the United Kingdom certainfacilities in Ceylon on terms and conditions to be agreed.Mr. Bandanaraike has been given a list of the facilities which the United Kingdom wishes to be made available,but he has said that he cannot accept it without prior jconsultation with his experts and Government colleagues
in Ceylon.    He is, however, prepared to include inthe clause a statement of the kind of facilities which willbe made available.    This is the explanation of the words&quot;e.g. for communications, movements and storage&quot;.He has made it plain that while local operation, management and control of the facilities made available to the UnitedKingdom will be entirely a matter for the United KingdomGovernment, the powers of the United Kingdom local representatives carrying out these functions must be under-stood to be derived from the general authority of theGovernment of Ceylon springing from the status of Ceylonas an independent sovereign State.4. We have pointed out to Mr. Bandanaraike that a document ofthis kind must, if it is to be politically acceptable in the United Kingdom,be capable of being shown to be to the mutual advantage of both countries.We should have preferred Clause 2 to have stated that the transfer of the bases would be subject to terms and conditions to be mutually agreed, inthe same way as Clause 5 states that the facilities to be afforded to theUnited Kingdom will also be subject to terms and conditions.Mr. Bandanaraike has, however, indicated that this would not be politicallypossible for him, since he must be able to show that the return of the bases to Ceylon is something which Ceylon has an unqualified right to demand.5. We cannot claim that the document is entirely satisfactory from our point of view.    The only card we have is the threat of unemployment at Trincomalee if we close down the Base altogether, and we have playedthis for all it is worth.6, It would, of course, be possible to avoid coming to anyconclusion at this stage and to break off discussions until Mr. Bandanaraikeis prepared to discuss the specific list of facilities which we have given him.    We fear, however, that this tactic might lead him either to make some statement very unfavourable to us on his return to Ceylon, or even to give us notice to quit.    On the other hand, if we concede the point ofprinciple now (and we have no real grounds on which we can refuse to concede it), we should obtain Mr. Bandanaraike&apos;s&quot; goodwill and so make it easier for us to keep the facilities we need.    In the last resort, we are dependent on the goodwill of Ceylon.7. Any statement that may be agreed should be published in Londonbefore Mr. Bandanaraike leaves on Sunday night if time allows. A state-?ment could be made in Parliament on Friday; otherwise there would haveto be a Press release, followed by a White Paper.H.W,M.4th July, 1956.
1. The following arrangements are made under the defence agreement, 1947.2, The Government of Ceylon expressed their desire to takeover the Naval Base at Trincomalee and the Royal Air Force stationas Katunayake. The United Kingdom Government agree to transfer*hem to the Government of Ceylon.3. This transfer shall take place in accordance with a phasedplan,      the timing ofwhich shall be mutually agreed.4. The financial arrangements in connection with this transferwill also be mutually agreed.5. The United Kingdom Government state that they wish tocontinue to be afforded certain facilities at present enjoyed by them in ceylon under the Defence Agreement, e. g. for communications, move-ments and storage.    The Government of Ceylon is prepared to grantsuch facilities on terms and conditions to be mutually agreed.6. The United Kingdom Government will afford on terms to be mutually agreed, assistance to the Ceylon Government for the expansion,development and training of the Ceylon Armed Forces.
