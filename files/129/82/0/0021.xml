Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1956CONFIDENTIALCP. (56) 1719th July, 1956\\CABINETLIBERALISATION OF TRADE IN THE ORGANISATION for european ECONOMIC CO-operation memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerUnder a decision of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation(O.E.E.C.) Council of January 1955, member countries were required, not later than 30th September, 1955: -(a) To liberalise at least 75 per cent, of their imports on private accountfrom O.E.E.C. countries in each of the three categories of foodstuffs,raw materials and manufactures;(b) To liberalise 90 per cent, of their private account imports overall fromO.E.E.C. countries;(c) To liberalise 10 per cent, of their private account trade still restricted.This obligation ceases to be binding after 30th September, 1956, unless member countries decide to consolidate it.2. We met our obligations under (a) and (c) but our overall liberalisationpercentage is only 85 per cent, and we are therefore in default on our obligation under (b). We have pleaded balance of payments difficulties as justification forthis default. This was readily accepted by the O.E.E.C. for a time; but recentlythere has been strong criticism of our continued failure especially as it can be used as an excuse for inaction by other member countries.3. To fulfil our obligation we should in practice need to liberalise paper-making materials (i.e., wood pulp and esparto) together with paper and board (butnot newsprint or paper manufactures).4. When we decided in September 1955 not to liberalise these items weestimated the cost of doing so at  15-20 million. The position has now changed.The paper and board industry is ancillary to a wide range of British industries andis therefore extremely sensitive to the general economic situation. We nowestimate that the cost of liberalisation would at most be not more than  1-limillion in a full year. Although we have not disclosed this estimate, other member countries of O.E.E.C. have formed their own view that the cost wouldbe inconsiderable and we are being severely criticised in the Organisation forour continued invocation of balance of payments difficulties.5. A major United Kingdom objective at the Meeting of the ministerial council of O.E.E.C. next week will be to consolidate the 90 per cent, obligationin order to protect our exports against any deliberalisation by other countries.We shall find it difficult to achieve this because we are not prepared to be forth-coming about the tariff; some member countries say that they cannot continueliberalisation of quotas without further reductions of tariffs. The President and have submitted a separate paper on this (CP. (56) 172). The difficulties which we will -face in trying to consolidate an obligation which we ourselves originally proposed (and fought hard for) will be very much greater if we have not ourselvesfulfilled it.50147Copy No.
6. It will be important to maintain confidence in sterling in the third quarterof the year, when the balance of visible trade is seasonally unfavourable and thegold and dollar reserves under pressure. To achieve our 90 per cent, obligationin Europe would be an expression of confidence in ourselves in just those quarterswhere we want to create the right impression so as to prevent confidence move-ments against sterling during that period. To be forced to argue that we could not afford even a small addition to our import bill could well be damaging, in suggesting that we had no confidence in the success of our own domestic measures.7. It is important that O.E.E.C., a body over which the Chancellor of theExchequer presides, should be kept vital during the months when the initiative in the trade field may be felt to lie with the Messina Powers meeting in Brussels.It might be possible to achieve this if we were ready to engage at once in a round of tariff reduction in Europe; but we are not. A readiness to discuss tariffreduction would not of itself be sufficient. It is therefore the more important that we should strengthen the O.E.E.C. and our own position in it by reaching the 90 per cent, target. It is in the field of liberalisation that the organisation has been doing its best work.8. These are the advantages of going to 90 per cent. The disadvantages areas follows:  (i) The cost cannot be predicted in advance with absolute accuracy. We areheavily dependent upon imports of raw materials, and our balance ofpayments difficulties since the war have been due in considerable measure to this fact. Our economy is not suffering because paper-making materials, paper and board imports are still restricted.Liberalisation now could result in significant additions to our importbill in the more distant future.(ii) A rigid policy of no liberalisation until the balance of payments is restoredis undoubtedly easier to enforce than a selective one. Although paper-making materials, paper and board are the only major basic materials,the import of which from Western Europe is still restricted, liberalisationmight tend to release pressures at home and abroad for liberalisationin other spheres and may be badly received at home when we still need to keep a strict hand on the economy. I should certainly feel obliged to concede some modest liberalisation of imports into the Colonies, whichmight cost another  1-1^- million.(iii) In certain circumstances, for example a levelling off in world trade at atime when there is considerable spare capacity at home, we might haveno alternative but to intensify import restrictions. Such a reversal ofpolicy, if it occurred in the near future, would be all the more dramaticand difficult to justify had we just gone to 90 per cent.9. The President of the Board of Trade and I have discussed this question and we should like to discuss it with our colleagues in the light of the above statement of the advantages and disadvantages.H. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W. I,7th My, 1956.
