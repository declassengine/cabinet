secret.P.(56) 19713th August, 1956.COPY NOCABINETSECONDARY EDUCATION;  Cyprus memorandum by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the colonies in April, after the breakdown of political discussions, withthe continued need to keep many of the Greek Cypriot schools closed for security reasons, Sir John Harding submitted certain proposals for thecontrol of Secondary Education.    The proposals which he then putforward were as follows:-(i)    Government would acquire, by compulsory purchaseif necessary,  seven schools, three in Nicosia, two inLimassol, one in Famagusta and one in Paphos.    Theprocess of acquisition would be spread over the next two years.    The intention would be that they should be managed and staffed by Government under the direct control of the Department of Education and would providethe &quot;modern&quot; stream in the new system.    They wouldprovide 3, 500 places.    The teachers would be recruited from the present practical and commercial schools.(ii)    As previously proposed and agreed, four technicalschools should be set up in different parts of the Island.(iii)    The town gymnasia would be tackled by offeringGovernment-aided status as a condition of (a) re-openingfor those closed by Government or (b)  opening for theschool year 1956-7 for those still functioning.    If thegoverning bodies of these schools refused to acceptGovernment-aided status, as was probable, they wouldbe replaced by governing bodies of officials who would accept Government-aided status on behalf of the school,and as soon as staff could be found for each school anattempt would be made to re-open it.(iv)   The village gymnasia would eventually be taken over as government-aided schools; for the present they wouldbe permitted to continue under present management, butif they engaged in indiscipline or subversive teachingwould be struck off the register, and would be allowedto re-open only as Government-aided schools.(v) The Governor intended to take Mission and Turkish schoolsinto the Government-aided category when the situation inthe Greek schools was established.(vi) The residence permits of the Greek national teachers wouldnot be renewed.
The Governor also proposed to explain his intentions by a statementof policy.2.        The Governors proposals were considered by the colonial policy Committee, where it was generally agreed that action should betaken to remove Greek national school teachers as and when their permitsexpired.    The following points of criticism of the Governors proposal were however made:-(a) They would give the Government controlledschools virtually a monopoly of education in the island, and so wholesale a policy would not be practicable.(b) Difficulti es were also felt about such a general extensionof Government control, more particularly in the context of any fresh initiative for the settlement of the cyprus problem as a whole, and about the element of compulsion(including compulsory purchase) which was involved.In particular it was not thought wise to encourage theGovernor to take over the Turkish schools.(c) It was felt that measures as drastic as those proposed,in particular that relating to the Government^ appoint-ment of teachers, would be regarded more in the lightof repression than of firmness.(d) The proposed statement of policy should be modifiedand the timing and context of the statement should beconsidered in the light of the progress made towardsthe political statement.3.        In view of the comments made and of developments in thepolitical field the Governor reviewed the matter at the end of June and made the following amended proposals:-(i)    Not to make any formal announcement of policy butsimply to inform the governing bodies of the five town .Gymnasia which had been closed by Government on grounds of security that in view of the records of theirschools during the past year and of the grave securityrisk which the breakdown of discipline in their schoolshas created the re-opening of these schools would haveto be conditional on the governing bodies accepting control in regard to staff, discipline, numbers and donations;(ii)    the same treatment might be accorded to any of the minor community schools which have been similarlyclosed for security reasons;(iii)   if all members of the Government bodies resign, theGovernor would appoint new governing bodies, probablyof Government officials;(iv)   at the same time the Governor would go ahead with buyingup a number of private schools and re-opening them as government schools.
4.        The Colonial Secretary told the Governor that he liked this new arrangement which he thought could be clearly defended as being on security grounds.    But even the new approach might give rise tocriticisms of de-hellenisation.    He therefore advised a short delay toavoid the risk of putting off some people who might have been ready to talk to Lord Radcliffe.    Sir John Harding agreed that there would be an advantage in deferring action for a week or two but said that he wouldlike shortly after Lord Radcliffe&apos;s departure to proceed by asking the chairmen of the governing bodies of the five schools to interview withhim individually.    He would then ask them to say what safeguards they propose against a renewal of indiscipline if the schools were allowedto re-open.    He thought that it was improbable that they would haveanything constructive to suggest and he would then tell them that without proper safeguards he could not permit re-opening and that he would bewriting to them shortly to indicate the conditions which he considered necessary.    When his letters had issued a sharp reaction must beexpected, but the policy would be easier to defend since it is clearlybased on security grounds.5.        Lord Radcliffe has now returned from his preliminary ,visit and since the action the Governor proposes to take will be based uponsecurity grounds, I should like to be in a position to authorise him togo ahead as soon as he decides that the moment is opportune.L.Colonial Office, S.W.1.13th August, 1956.
