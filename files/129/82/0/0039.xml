HOUSE OF LORDS reform memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilOn 17th May the Cabinet invited the Lord Chancellor and myself to consult with the Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Whips in both Houses on theproposals for the reform of the House of Lords outlined in the papers whichthe Lord Chancellor and I had submitted to the Cabinet (C.P,(56) 116 and 119)(CM. (56) 37th Conclusions, Minute 4).    We have had the assistance of anOfficial Committee, under the Chairmanship of the Permanent Secretary ofthe Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department, which has prepared the two draft bills which are annexed to this memorandum.2.     We remain of the opinion that the danger of drifting into single -chamber government is now serious and that it is very desirable that legisla-tion should be introduced very soon: indeed, the next session may presentthe only opportunity that will occur for many years to achieve a sufficientmeasure of reform to ensure the continuance of the House.    On the otherhand, the weakness of any comprehensive scheme of reform is that its success will depend on the co-operation of the Opposition Parties.    &quot;We must recognise the possibility, however remote, that the Labour Party mightboycott the scheme completely and refuse either to submit recommendations to the Prime Minister for life peerages or to allow Labour hereditary Peersto serve on the Selection Committee or, if selected, to sit in the House.However, we do not think that that prospect should deter us: in opposingreform the Labour Party would be on difficult political ground, and opinion inthat Party in favour of single-chamber government is probably not strong enough to enable them indefinitely to refuse to co-operate in the reformed house.3.     In the course of our discussion we have modified our views on two important points which formed part of the plan which we previously submittedto the Cabinet:-(a)   Contrary to our previous opinion, we now believe thatprovisions for dealing with the financial position ofmembers of the reformed House should not beincluded in the Bill, but should be treated as aseparate proposition.    We consider that it would seriously prejudice the passage of any reform Billif it contained provisions for payment, and thatthis matter should be left until such time as it becomes possible to introduce a Bill relating tothe salaries of junior Ministers and the paymentof Members of the House of Commons.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use top SECRET Copy No.C.P,(56) 18924th July, 1956CABINET
(b)   In any Bill covering the complete scheme of reform weshould aim at presenting the narrowest possible frontto amendment and that, therefore, matters of detailrelating to the machinery of selection of the hereditary peers should be omitted from the Bill.4.      We consider that there are two alternatives open to the Governmentto introduce:- / i(a) A one-clause Bill simply giving the Crown power to conferlife peerages on men and women.    This would not dealwith the backwoodsmen, who present a problem which,though more imaginary than real in presentcircumstances, is nevertheless still open to politicalexploitation.    Such a Bill could be presented as anemergency operation to save the life of the House;  or(b) A more ambitious Bill which, in addition to conferringon the Crown the power to create a limited number of life peerages, would, at the same time, cut down therights of hereditary Peers by providing that onlya limited number selected by the House should havepower to sit and vote.The two Bills annexed to this memorandum are intended to illustrate the legislation needed in each case.THE SHORTER VERSION5.     The shorter version, in effect, does no more than reverse thedecision in the Wensleydale case, except that in addition it enables women to be admitted to the House as holders of life peerages, though not ashereditary Peeresses.    The advantage of the shorter version is that itwould consume less Parliamentary time and that the scope and detailof the Bill would present the narrowest possible front to amendment anddebate.6.     We do not, however, recommend that so restricted a measureshould be introduced.    The object of reforming the House is to increasepublic confidence in it, and this would not, in our opinion, be achieved byany measure which did not deal radically with the problem of the back-woodsmen.    We consider, therefore, that what is required is the shortestand simplest measure which would achieve this object, and that the shorterversion should only be considered if all else fails.THE LONGER VERSION7.     The contents of the longer version are as follows:-Clause 1.     This clause gives the Crown powers to create a maximum number of 200 life peerages carrying the right to sit and vote in theHouse of Lords.    Life Peers may resign their right to receive a Writof Summons, but not their peerages.    75 life Peers may be created inthe first instance, and thereafter a maximum of 15 each year, apart fromfilling vacancies caused by death or retirement.Clause 2.     This clause provides that the number of hereditary Peersentitled to attend the House of Lords in any future Parliament shall be restricted to not more than 200, who are to be selected by the House ofLords and who are to be persons appearing to the House to be individually-2-
well-fitted for their duties.    The Royal Dukes, the Law Lords, and past and present Cabinet Ministers are excepted from the clause, and willcontinue to be entitled to their Writs of Summons as of right.Clause 3.     This clause provides that a life peerage may be conferred on a woman and that United Kingdom Peeresses in their own right maybe selected to sit in the House in the same way as United Kingdomhereditary Peers.    Scottish Peeresses in their own right are madeeligible to vote in elections of Scottish representative Peers, and to be elected as such.Clause 4.    This clause provides that life Peers who resign, hereditaryUnited Kingdom Peers who have not been selected, and hereditaryScottish Peers who have not been elected as Scottish representativePeers, shall have the right to vote at elections for the House of Commons.The Bill does not enable any Peer to be elected to the House of Commons.0. In the course of preparing this Bill we discussed certain important questions on which our conclusions are set out below.Life Peers9.     We considered it necessary that life Peers should have the rightto resign because their number is limited and it will therefore be desirableto enable old or infirm life Peers to make room for fresh creations,10.    The Bill says nothing about the method of selecting life peers or the proportions in which life peerages are to be distributedamongst the Parties.    We think it clear that this matter could notusefully be dealt with by an express provision in the Bill.11.    The reason for placing the limit to the number of creations thatmay be made in the first instance as high as 75, and the annual rate of increase as high as 15, is that it seems essential mat the number of life peers should be brought up to the maximum as soon as possible, andthat the right number of creations is the largest that is compatible with maintaining a high enough standard.    Even at the rate proposed inthe Bill, on the assumption that it is passed in 1957, parity with the selected hereditary Peers will not be reached until 1966.Restriction of Rights of Hereditary Peers12.    As already mentioned, the Bill states that the number of hereditary Peers in any future Parliament is not to exceed 200 to be selected by the House of Lords;  and nothing is said in it about the machinerof selection.    It appeared to us to be preferable that, so far as possible,the limitation of the numbers of hereditary Peers should be carried outby the House of Lords itself under its own procedure.    This is a proposal which has already met with support among the Peers, but the SwintonCommittee found that the House itself had no power to limit its numbersby Standing Order and that legislation would be necessary.    What theBill does, therefore, in effect, is to impose upon the House the obligationto reform itself, which it would do by means of a Selection Committeeappointed in the normal way.    The composition of the Selection Committeewould be settled by consultation between the Leaders of the Parties inthe House and it would include a reasonable proportion of back-benchersand cross benchers.    The object would be to have on the SelectionCommittee the best people in the House and no doubt, in course of time,it might include also some life Peers.
13. Similarly, in order not to fetter the discretion of the House,nothing is said in the Bill (except in general terras in clause 2(2)) about what principles the Committee is to apply in making its selections.No doubt the Opposition Parties would prefer some statutory direction tothe Selection Committee which would ensure adequate representation inthe reformed House for themselves and other interests whom they mightclaim to represent.    But the difficulties of drafting any satisfactoryprovision proved insuperable.    We consider that the only practicablemethod of dealing with this problem is to give assurances in parliament that the Opposition Parties will be fairly represented on the SelectionCommittee.14. By limiting the number both of life Peers and hereditary peers the Bill in effect abolishes the swamping power.    We consider thatwith the reduction of the delaying power of the House to one year there isno longer any need to retain the swamping power.15. The Bill can be criticised on the grounds that it favourslife Peers in that their rights are conferred upon them for life, whilstthose of hereditary Peers depend upon their selection for each parliament by the Selection Committee.    This is unavoidable but the criticism canbe met, at least in part, on the following grounds:(i)      The life Peers will have been selected fortheir special fitness to be legislators;(ii)      The hereditary Peer who has been selected for one Parliament, and justifies his selection,is likely to continue to be selected forsuccessive Parliaments.Admission of Women16.    The proposal that Peeresses in their own right should beadmitted to the House has met with opposition in the past from the LabourParty on the ground that it enlarges hereditary rights, and there may becriticism of its inclusion in this Bill, the object of which is to narrowsuch rights.    We mink the objection falls with the limitation of the hereditary element to 200.    It would presumably be welcome to theLabour Party that within this limit women should have the sameopportunities as men.Procedure with the Bill17. We still think it desirable that before the Bill is introduced a Resolution should be moved in the House of Lords which would set outin detail the plan of reform, including all such matters as the machinery and procedure of the Selection Committee, which are omitted from theBill and which would be dealt with by a revision of the Standing orders of the House.    The advantages of this course are that acceptance of theResolution would demonstrate the willingness of the House to reformitself while, if the Resolution met with such opposition in the Lords asmade it unlikely that the Bill would be passed by that House, theGovernment would be able to fall back on the shorter version takingpower only to create life peerages.18. We think it advisable that the Resolution should not bepublished until after the Party conferences in October, but should bepublished and debated before The Queen&apos;s Speech at the opening of thenew Session.    But it is also essential that the Resolution should bepublished sufficiently long in advance of the debate on it.    This points
to its being debated at the end of the autumn spill-over and published atleast a fortnight earlier.    A spill-over of less than 3 weeks would not therefore accommodate this programme.19. If the autumn spill-over is not to be long enough to enableadequate notice to be given, then the debate on the Resolution could take place at the beginning of the next session, after the debate in the lords on The Queen&apos;s Speech has been finished but when that debate isstill continuing in the Commons.    But this course is obviously far lessattractive.20. &quot;We think that the balance of advantage lies in introducing the Bill in the House of Commons.Points for Decision21. There are three difficult questions upon which we havenot reached a firm decision and which we submit for the considerationof our colleagues.The Right of Peers to Vote and to Sit inthe House of Commons22. We have considered whether the Bill should provide thatthose Peers who are not eligible to receive Writs of Summons to theHouse of Lords shall be able not only to vote at elections for the Houseof Commons but to stand themselves for election.    If such a provisionwere included we think that the right should only be given to hereditary peers and not to life Peers (who will have become Peers by their ownchoice and not involuntarily), and that once the right had been exercisedthe decision to do so should be irrevocable, although it would not bindthe Peer&apos;s descendants.23. The arguments for and against such a provision are nicelybalanced.    On the one hand, since the hereditary rights of Peers arecut down by the Bill it may seem only just that they should be given thesame rights as ordinary citizens.    Moreover, even if nothing is said inthe Bill, amendments are likely to be moved to relieve the position ofthose who, like Lord Hailsham and Mr. Wedgwood Benn, M,P., are atpresent prevented from, or hampered in, pursuing a career in the commons by the disabilities of peerage and for whom sympathy has been expressed.24. On the other hand, it is probable that such a provision would be resented by the Commons, and it may be argued that, even ascut down by the Bill, the rights of hereditary Peers are still considerable.They supply one half of the members of the reformed House and theirchances of being selected by the Selection Committee are incomparablygreater than those of an ordinary citizen to be elected a^Member of theHouse of Commons.    It may well be felt that it will be the necessaryprice to pay for the continuance of the hereditary element in thelegislature at all, that those who will still possess the hereditary rightto offer themselves for selection by the Selection Committee should notbe eligible to sit in the House of Commons.25. On the whole our view is that it would be preferable thatthe Bill should be introduced without any such provision but that, if an amendment is moved by Mr. Wedgwood Benn in the Commons which is accepted by that House, there would be no objection to the Governmentaccepting it.    It is an argument for introducing the Bill in the Commons*5i
that this would provide the least embarrassing opportunity for suchan amendment to be moved.Representation of the Church of Scotland26. The claim has been advanced in the past that as an established Church the Church of Scotland should have the same rightto be represented       reformed House of Lords as the Church of England,and there is little doubt that in the present state of Scottish opinion, this claim would be pressed with great vigour and might lead to considerable political difficulties in Scotland.    It may be difficult to resist, but thearguments for resisting it appear to us very strong.27. There being no Bishops, representation of the Church ofScotland could only be secured by some device such as nomination by theNational Assembly of the Church of Scotland.    The principle of permittingan outside body to nominate its representatives in the House would, in ouropinion, be an exceedingly dangerous one to introduce in the Bill, for itwould provoke claims not only from other churches and denominationsbut also from professional bodies and sectional interests of all kinds.These claims could only be distinguished from those of the Church ofScotland on the ground that that Church is established by law, but we thinkthat this line would be difficult to hold.20. We should prefer, therefore, to have no express provision in the Bill for representation of the Church of Scotland.    It is worth considering whether a promise should be made by the Prime Minister inParliament that, before making his recommendations for the creation of life peerages, he would invite representatives of the Church of scotland to submit names to him.    But the objection to this course is that a merepromise would probably not satisfy Scottish opinion.    In any case, it is inconsistent with the Presbyterian system of church government for representatives of the church to be appointed by the Crown on therecommendation of a Minister.29. We recommend that the Bill should be introduced without any provision for representation of the Church of Scotland, but that we shouldbe prepared to make a concession later if the strength of opinion inScotland appears to make that course desirable.Bishops30. As drafted at present the Bill omits any reference toBishops whose position (like those of the Law Lords and the Irishrepresentative Peers) is untouched.    The advantage of this is that itshortens the Bill, that any alteration of the position of the Bishops would increase the likelihood of controversy over representation of the church of Scotland, and that a change in the representation of the Church ofEngland in the House would itself be controversial.    On the other hand,there is much to be said for reducing the number of the Bishops inParliament.    They themselves rarely take advantage of their rights toattend the House and the obligation on them to attend in order to readPrayers is generally regarded as burdensome.    The duties of a diocesanBishop in these days are so heavy that few of them can spare the time tocome to the House regularly.    The number might be reduced to 5 (beingthe 2 Archbishops and the Bishops of London, Durham and Winchester) or,if that is thought to be too few, 12 (being those already mentioned, withthe addition of the next 7 senior Bishops).
31.    We recommend that at the moment the position of the Bishops shouldbe left untouched by the Bill but that, before its introduction, the views ofthe Archbishop of Canterbury should be sought.CONC LUSION32.   I seek the approval of my colleagues to the proposals contained inthis paper (and, in particular, those in paragraphs 22-31) and authorityfor a final draft of the Bill, and drafts of the appropriate Resolution andStanding Orders, to be prepared.S.Privy Council Office, S.W.1.23rd July, 1956.
