THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (56) 15325th June, 1956COPY NO.CABINE TADENMemorandum by the Secretary of State fcr the ColonilesI am so sorry that this is a disagreeably long paper.My colleagues know that recently Aden Colony and Protectoratehave been subjected to numerous threats to their security.    Up tillabout nine months ago these threats were chiefly manifested by directaggression from the Yemen, supplemented, particularly in later months,by the activities of dissidents of Protectorate tribes instigated and supported by the Yemeni authorities.    Measures taken to strengthen thesecurity forces in the Protectorate have done much to contain these activities, although the threat from the Yemen and also from Saudi Arabiais still considerable, and no relaxation of vigilance is possible.    Sincethe beginning of this year there has also been a wave of strikes, coupled with incidents, in the Colony;  and, although it was established by theCommission of Enquiry that these strikes had a genuine and justifiableindustrial basis, nevertheless attempts were certainly made to makepolitical capital out of them, mainly through the instigation of membersof the United National Front in the Colony who had also been concerned. in the recent formation of a number of new trade unions.     Beyond allthese activities is the constant pressure of Egypt, exercised through avirulent campaign of anti-British propaganda.    Most recently the pointof attack appears to have shifted both from the frontier area and fromthe industrial field in the Colony to the efforts being made by the ArabNational Congress, and particularly that political element of it knownas the South Arabia League, in attempts to stir up Pan-Arab and anti-British nationalism both in the Colony and the Protectorate,2.     I attach at Appendix A extracts from the two latest IntelligenceSummaries, which refer to activities of the South Arabian League in the coastal part of the Protectorate, and the special part played in them byMohammed ali al Jiffri and others.3.     In this situation, the Governor of Aden has concluded that aserious threat to security both in the Colony and the Protectorate willexist unless Mohammed Ali al Jiffri, his brother, and two of theircousins, all bearing the name of al Jiffri, are neutralised.    These fourmen are all British Protected Persons by virtue of the fact that theyare subjects of Rulers in the Protectorate in treaty relationship with her MajestyTs Government.4.     I did not like the idea of deporting these men to some Colonial(or other) territory at a considerable distance from Aden.    There were first the general and special objections to the deportation of &quot;belongers&quot;
to which I refer in paragraphs 6 and 7 below.    But, additionally, I founddifficulty in finding any Colonial territory where, for political, climatic,or practical reasons, it would be reasonable to remove them, especially since special legislation would have been necessary for that purpose inthe receiving territory.    I therefore asked the Governor if he would consider their rustication to some remote part of the Protectorateitself.    He has agreed, and has suggested that they should be detained in the Island of Kamaran - the status of which I describe in paragraph 9below.    I recommend this course to my colleagues.5.     To remove these persons from the States in the Protectorate towhich they &quot;belong&quot; or in which they may happen to be found, whether bydeportation to a place outside the Protectorate, or by rustication to a place inside the Protectorate, or to the Island of Kamaran, the Governorneeds certain powers which he does not at present possess.    Under the aden Protectorate Orders, 1937 to 1952, he does possess certain limitedlegislative power in the Protectorate in respect of British subjects andforeigners.    For this it would be necessary to extend this power notonly to cover subjects of the Protectorate Rulers, but also to enable theGovernor to take powers himself for the removal, in any appropriateway, of such subjects.    I therefore propose to arrange to submit toHer Majesty on 29th June a draft amending Order in Council which willgive power to the Governor to make &quot;such provision as he is satisfiedis necessary or expedient for maintaining or securing public safety or public order in the Protectorate, having regard to the international obligations of Her Majesty&apos;s Government for the external relations,defence and security of the Protectorate or any part thereof&quot;.    For thereasons given below there are certain risks involved even in the taking of these powers by Order in Council, whether or not the Governor wereto act under them thereafter, and for that reason I consider it necessaryto secure the consent of my colleagues to the action which I propose.6.     Both the taking of these powers, and any action which theGovernor may thereafter take under them, especially if it took the formof the removal of these persons in any v/ay, is calculated to lead to aloud chorus of disapproval in the Arab world, supported to some extent by sympathisers in this country, and possibly also to objections in theforum of the United Nations.    The action in view is also likely to givehandles to hostile propaganda.    The more drastic the action actuallytaken, i. e. deportation rather than local removal, the greater will bethe opposition,7.     Taking these powers by Order in Council is likely to be speciallyobjectionable to the more sophisticated Protectorate Rulers, particularly the Sultan of Lahej, when it is seen that the object of the powers is toenable the Governor to take action against Protectorate subjects ofRulers over the heads of those Rulers.    In whatsoever way they may beremoved under the new powers to be given to the Governor, it will beapparent to the Rulers that the Governor has been given power by her Majesty&apos;s Government to legislate for the States and thereby tocarry out an executive act in relation to Arab subjects of the States,Her Majesty&apos;s Government does not possess jurisdiction to take a stepof this nature under the Advisory Treaties with the Rulers, so if it is done without their agreement it will be a unilateral assumption of jurisdiction by an Act of State.    It is also obvious that action of this nature offends against the fundamental principle on which hitherto wehave dealt with the Protectorate States, by interfering to the least
possible degree with their internal affairs;   this is a principle to which wehave made public allusion from time to time in the recent past, and upon it is based the tentative move by which we are encouraging the Federa-tion of the States and also by which we are encouraging the Rulers toenter into an oil agreement.    So far as these removals are concerned,, itwould naturally be most desirable that the consent and agreement of the rulers concerned should be obtained.    The Sultan of Lahej is the employer of two of the persons concerned,! and the Governor has advised that he would be unlikely to give his consent to their removal fromLaliej.    He will however inform him of the action proposed, if it is approved, in advance of taking it.    I am still in correspondence with theGovernor on whether the consent of other Rulers in those States wherethe other two Jiffris may happen to be could be counted upon, andwhether he proposes to attempt to gain their co-operation.    Eut I amassuming that the consent of the Rulers cannot be guaranteed and that,therefore, it will be necessary for the Governor to have the powers of direct legislative action under the amending Order in Council.8.     I have considered whether, to avoid the need for taking thesepermanent legislative powers by means of amendment to the aden protectorate Orders in Council, it would not be sufficient to authorisethe Governor to invoke the emergency Powers Orders in Council, 1939and 1956, which apply to the Aden Protectorate and under which, incase of public emergency, the Governor may legislate by emergencyregulation.    I have rejected this alternative on two grounds.    Firstbecause, in my opinion, the conditions prevailing at present in the protectorate do not justify declaring a state of emergency;  and secondly,because it would not be possible to maintain a declared state ofemergency indefinitely,  so that eventually if it were thought necessary tokeep the Jiffris out of the Protectorate for a considerable time, itwould be necessary to assume the more permanent powers now proposed.There is the additional point that it would be obvious to all hostilecritics that the state of emergency was declared simply and solely forthe purpose of achieving the removal of four individuals, and this action might be difficult to justify in Parliament and elsewhere.9.     I propose, as I have said, that they should be removed anddetained in the Island of Kamaran.    This Island lies about 200 miles north-west of Aden Colony, somewhat north of Hodeida in the Yemen, andis divided from the Yemen by a narrow strait of not more than 10 milesbreadth.    I have decided that the disadvantage of this proximity to the yemen will have to be accepted in present circumstances.    The status of this territory is unusual.    It was occupied by our forces in the 1914-18War from the Turks, and we have continued to occupy it ever since.For some reason it was omitted from the allocation of liberated enemy territories carried out by the Treaty of Lausanne.    It has never been formally annexed by us but for the purposes of the British nationality act it has been treated as a Protectorate.    Under the Karnaran Orderin Council 1949, the Governor of the Colony of Aden is also theGovernor of Kamaran, and he has power to make laws for the peace,order and good government of the Island.    The Governor therefore has at present adequate powers for making provision for the reception ofthese persons in Kamaran and for keeping them there.    On the otherhand, the Government of the Yemen claim this territory as part of the yemen, and this fact will give rise to further objections by our enemiesif the Jiffris are detained there.
10.    My colleagues should know of the possibility that, although it isproposed to remove these people to a place which is under the Governor&apos;administration and not to a remote territory, this may give rise to questions bearing on our general policy in relation to deportation ofBritish subjects and British Protected Persons.    Up to now, on theprinciple that deportation of &quot;belongers&quot; from any Colonial territory in normal times and short of a situation in which a declaration of anemergency is justified is objectionable, the policy has been not topermit Colonial Governors to take powers to deport ,fbelongers&quot; if theydid not already have those powers;  and consideration has been given fora considerable time to the repeal of such powers in those colonial territories which still retain them, although for a number of reasonsthis has not been pressed upon Colonial Governments since 1954.    As aresult of recent Questions in Parliament, this whole matter is underreview and I may wish to recommend some modification of policy in thedirection of allowing such Colonial Governments as have reason to do soto retain or extend their powers in this respect.11.     There is one further possible objection to the action proposed.The removal of these people to Kamaran will involve their being keptthere for a considerable time.    It is not proposed that they should bekept in close confinement, but we must obviously prevent their leaving the Island.    They will thus be deprived of their liberty, and this may berepresented as a violation of the obligations of Her MajestyTs government under the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and fundamental Freedoms, Article 5 of which covers the liberty of thesubject.    There is no doubt that by this action we should be violatingthe spirit of these undertakings, and on security grounds   we shall haveto defend that action;   but it is fortunate that, so far as the legality isconcerned, neither the Aden Protectorate nor Kamaran itself have beenbrought within the scope of the Convention by formal notification,    Ishould add, however, that if now or at any future date it were considered necessary to arrange to deport these or other persons, and to detainthem in some Colonial territory, we should have to make a formalderogation from the Convention of Human Rights which could only bedone, as in the case of Cyprus, by representing that a grave state ofemergency existed in the Aden Protectorate.12.    I am satisfied as to the subversive activities of the Jiffris, andthat it would not have been possible to bring them to trial for some breach of the law.    There has been a prima facie case against one, that heattempted to seduce Government Courts from their allegiance, but theGovernor was advised that a jury conviction against him could not be guaranteed.    Apart from that each of these men has been scrupulouslycareful not to say anything in the Colony (i, e. as opposed to the protectorate) which would justify a charge of sedition, although theirutterances have been extremely anti-British and anti-Government.The case against them is that their activities in the Colony, when theyvisit it, are on the borderline of sedition and that in the Protectoratethey are subversive of our paramount authority and liable to cause a breach of the peace by the inflammatory nature of their speeches.    Itis largely on these grounds that the Governor has taken the view that action against them must be by the Executive, and that it would not be appropriate or wise to involve the judiciary in the investigation of their activities - even if that were possible in the circumstances, of the protectorate.
13.    The Governor also reports that if action to remove the Jiffris istaken, that action would be generally approved in the Colony andProtectorate, although the party to which these persons belong would bevociferous.    There will probably be resentment in Lahej and Abyan whichcould take the form of demonstrations.    Loyal Protectorate Rulers andleaders of moderate opinion in the Colony would be re-assured andinterpret the action as an earnest of our determination not to departfrom our declared policies for the Colony and Protectorate.14.    Having regard to the Governors assurances on this matter, I am convinced that the removal of the Jiffris to Kamaran is a reasonable and proper course to take, and that the answer to all criticism that may arise must simply be that Her Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfied thatthe security and therefore the welfare of the Aden Protectorate can only .be ensured by these means, and that Her Majesty&apos;s Government havethe responsibility for maintaining that security and welfare.15*    I therefore ask my colleagues to agrees-(l)   That I should advise Her Majesty to make an amendingOrder in Council to the Aden Protectorate Order, 1937on the lines indicated in paragraph 5.(2) That, as soon as the Order has come into operation, theGovernor should be authorised to take the powers under it which he requires, and to remove the Jiffris toKamaran, and keep them there.A.L.-B.Colonial Office, S.W.1.23 rd June, 1956.
APPENDIX A---Extract from Aden Intelligence Summary for period6th-12th June, 1956.    (Aden telegram No. 380.)X X X X xB.    Aden Protectorate(l)  On the 10th June a political meeting of the South Arabian Leaguewas held at Ja&apos;ar, the administrative centre of the Lower Yafa part ofthe Abyan area.    Sayid Muhammad &apos;Ali al Jifri, Shaikhan &apos; Abdullah alHabshi and other League members made the usual type of speechesattacking &quot;Colonialism&quot; and calling for independence.    The meeting was fairly well attended, among those present being the Lower Yafa&apos; Naib(the son of the Lower Yafa&apos; Sultan) and a number of Fadhli and LowerYafa1 State officials.    It is understood that a similar meeting of theLeague will be held at Zinjibar, the Fadhli State capital, on the17th June.(2) These meetings are indicative of the extension into the protectorate of the activities of the South Arabian League, which atone time were confined to Aden Colony.    For some little time past theLeague has been active in Lahej, where Muhammad &apos;Ali al Jifri lives and where the activities of the League have at least the tacit acceptanceof the Sultan of Lahej.    With the League now becoming active in cotton-producing area of Abyan and with the establishment of a branchat Yeshbum in the XJp-percent Aulaqi area, political difficulties of a new and potentially serious nature are a possibility.x x x xxExtract from Aden Intelligence Summary for period13th-19th June, 1956&apos;.&apos;   (Aden telegram No. 397.)&quot;&quot;x x x xxB,    Aden Protectorate(2) Political activities have increased, and following the meetingat Jaar on the 10th June (reported in my signal No. 380, B(l)), asimilar meeting of the South Arabian League was held at Zinjibar, theFadhli State capital, on the 17th June.    Sayid Muhammad Ali Al Jifriand his party made the usual anti-British, anti-Colonialist/lmperialistspeeches.    Such meetings do disproportionate harm in an area wherestrength is admired and where the local population have difficulty inunderstanding why such meetings are not prohibited.
