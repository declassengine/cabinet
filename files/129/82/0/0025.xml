Printed for the Cabinet,  July 1956CopyNO. 2gCABINETCHINESE REPRESENTATION IN THE UNITED nations memorandum by the Foreign secretary in recent years the General Assembly of the United Nations have disposed ofthe question of Chinese representation by passing a &quot; moratorium &quot; resolution atthe beginning of each session deciding not to consider proposals for unseating the nationalists or seating the Communists &quot; for the duration of the present session in the current year.&quot; The United States Government have asked to be assuredat an early date of our support for the use of this procedure once again at this year&apos;ssession of the General Assembly and for our agreement that, in view of the lateopening of the Assembly, the &quot; moratorium &quot; resolution should not be confined tothe current year but should be extended throughout the next session.2. There can be no question of the strength of United States feeling on this.President Eisenhower said during the Washington talks last February that it was quite possible that the seating of the Communists would result in the withdrawal ofthe United States from the United Nations and the expulsion of the headquarters of the organisation from New York. Moreover, quite apart from United Statesopposition, it is by no means sure that an early settlement of the question in favourof the Chinese Communists would be of benefit to the United Kingdom indeed,the effects in Malaya and Singapore would certainly be adverse. In any event the americans are likely, even without us, to be able to muster sufficient support forthe &quot; moratorium.&quot; There is no sufficiently direct United Kingdom interest whichwould justify the harm which we would do to our relations with the Americans,and possibly also with the Old Commonwealth, if we withdrew our support now.3. If this is accepted, there is much to be said for extending the&quot; moratorium &quot; resolution to cover the whole of the next session which will be prolonged into 1957. The Americans wili be no more ready to make a change inJanuary than in November, and we should only give the Communists a further opportunity for exploiting our differences.4. The problem was discussed at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos;Conference. It was generally accepted that, while it was desirable that communist china should eventually have a seat in the United Nations, no progress could bemade towards a settlement of the problem, at least until after the United StatesPresidential election. The Old Commonwealth stressed the importance of notallowing the Communists to use the issue to drive a wedge between the Common-wealth and the United States. The Old Commonwealth and probably alsoPakistan will be prepared to vote in favour of a &quot; moratorium &quot; resolution. the indians and the Ceylonese, although they will probably vote against it, understandour reasons for supporting it.5.  It would seem best to communicate our decision to the Americans now.Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador feels strongly, and I agree, that this will yield betterdividends in other United Nations matter of more direct interest to us, e.g. Cyprus,than delaying tactics designed to facilitate a horse trade on individual items.50171SECRETCP.

6. There may not be too much trouble over this question at this year&apos;general Assembly. But, if the question is not regulated in 1957, there may well bea major crisis in the organisation. It might be argued, therefore, that we shouldtell the Americans now that we are supporting the &quot; moratorium &quot; only on the definite understanding that the substantive issue will be decided in 1957. But,though we hope that the American position will become less rigid during 1957, wecan have no confidence that, even by the autumn, the United States administration will have worked out a policy which will enable them to acquiesce in a change.For the present, therefore, it might be best to confine ourselves to expressing ourforebodings to them, tell them that we realise that in an election year it is difficultto take matters further, but that we shall want to have a full discussion as soon aspossible in 1957.recommendations. I recommend accordingly that my colleagues should agree that weshould -(a) support a &quot; moratorium &quot; resolution covering the whole of the next sessionof the General Assembly;(b) inform the Commonwealth and the Americans now of our decision, butgive warning of the risks which we foresee if there is further delay in settling the question in 1957.S.
