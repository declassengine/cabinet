THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT &apos;Printed for the Cabinet. June1956CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 2 8CP. (56) 152   : v.-r:: , &apos;      mhJM ih^ ^SjqnJoV^ -y\ [liy/ uiuiiT ivr]25th June, 1956 i , yCABINETCYPRUSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs feel that my colleagues should know that the Greek Government have made an application to the European Commission of Human Rights, alleging that theConvention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms(Cmd. 8969 and Cmd. 9921) has been violated by the authorities in Cyprus.This Convention has been accepted by Greece and the United Kingdom andextends to Cyprus. The original Greek application contained complaints oftorture, degrading punishments, inhuman treatment, arbitrary arrest and detention(including that of Archbishop Makarios), censorship of correspondence, restrictionson the right of public assembly and similar accusations.2. The first point for the Commission was whether the Greek application should be admitted for consideration. This was argued before the Commission inStrasbourg on 1st June by Mr. Vallat, Deputy Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office,who has been appointed United Kingdom Agent for the case and by the GreekAgent and Counsel. Mr. Vallat said that the Greek application was beingconsidered as a matter of urgency, but it was a long and complicated document and he asked that the United Kingdom should be allowed a period of three months to submit their comments on the admissibility of the application. The Commissiongave its decision on 2nd June. It ruled that the Greek complaint was admissible,but a number of consequential points went in our favour.3.  The results may be summarised as follows:  (a) To our Advantage: (i) All accusations of torture have been deleted.(ii) The application has been limited to legislative measures and administrativepractices in Cyprus. The Commission have no intention of allowing the Greek Government to pursue individual cases under the presentapplication.(iii) The likelihood of the Commission staging a local enquiry in Cyprus hasbeen greatly reduced.(iv) Some understanding has been obtained of how the minds of the membersof the Commission are working. They have a prejudice againstwhipping as a punishment because it is said to have been abolished inthirteen of the member States of the Council of Europe. They also have a prejudice against collective punishment as such because it involves punishing the innocent without trial.On derogation from obligations under the Convention they are open to argument. On the whole, the members of the Commission are well aware of the political implications and the motives of the GreekGovernment, but they are equally determined to deal with theapplication on the basis of the Convention and the facts which can beproved without investigating individual cases.(v) The Commission have been favourably impressed by the moderate UnitedKingdom attitude.50076
To our Disadvantage : (i) The  United  Kingdom  request  for  time  to  submit  observations on admissibility has been rejected out of hand.(ii) The application has been admitted and will now be referred to asub-commission.(iii)/The Greek case has been simplified and consolidated and consequently tosome extent strengthened,(iv) There will be a comparatively early hearing on the merits.   &apos; &apos; i    :? .*!.&apos;.:4.  The next steps will be as follows :  (i) The application by the Greek Government will be referred to asub-commission composed of two members nominated by the parties and five other members chosen by lot.(ii) The written pleading of the Greek Government will follow by 12th July.(iii) The United Kingdom written pleading will follow within a time to befixed by the President of the Commission.(iv) Subsequently there will be an oral hearing before the sub-commission.(v) If the sub-commission are unable to achieve a settlement the matter willbe referred to the Commission and the Commission will report to theCommittee of Ministers.(vi) The Committee of Ministers will then decide by a majority of two-thirds of the members entitled to sit on the Committee whether there has beena violation of the Convention. The decision of the Committee ofMinisters will be binding.(vii) Meanwhile consideration is being given here to raising a case against theGreek Government, based on the transmissions of Athens Radio andother actions of that Government in connection with the terroristmovement.S.
