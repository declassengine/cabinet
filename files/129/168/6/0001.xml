I   The Governmenfs ProposalsIntroductionScotland has two lay summary criminal courts, where the ordinary citizenpresides to hear and deal with criminal charges. Both have a long and historictradition. The origins of the justice of the peace court are to be found in the anxiety of the Crown to maintain &apos;the peace, quiet and good government&apos; of&apos;all the shires of this Kingdom&apos; (phrases quoted from the Act of the ScotsParliament of 1661, o338). The burgh court (often still called the policecourt) derives from the responsibility of the provost and magistrates, datingfrom the middle ages, for law and order in the burghs; but since power todiscipline their citizens was given to magistrates by charters, the burgh court may be regarded as wielding the authority of the Crown by delegation. Overthe years these two courts, the one exercising a jurisdiction over burghs, andthe other mainly over landward or country areas, have dealt with a substantial proportion of the less serious criminal cases in Scotland and have done so with a high degree of speed, efficiency and economy. In the period sinceWorld War II, however, the relative importance of the lay summary courtshas declined. Legislation has often been passed without thought being givento whether offences arising under it are suitable to be brought within thejurisdiction of Scottish lay summary courts, and more generally little explicitconsideration has been given to the part that these courts may play in theevolving pattern of criminal justice. For such reasons the proportion of summary cases dealt with in these courts has fallen from 55 per cent in 1946to 40 per cent in 1970, and the sheriff court has become overloaded with the lesser offences.2 An opportunity to review the function of the lay summary courts has arisen as a result of the reform of local government and the government intend to grasp it. Following the report of the Royal Commission on LocalGovernment in Scotland presided over by Lord Wheatley (Cmnd 4150,September 1969) the Local Government (Scotland) Bill now before parliament will replace the existing system of local government based on the county andthe burgh by a system based on regions comprising districts. In other words,the local areas of government will no longer distinguish the burghs from theirsurrounding countryside. The implication that fresh arrangements will thenbe necessary for dealing with the criminal cases now heard in the burgh courtwas noted by the Royal Commission (paragraph 1102) and they published amemorandum of evidence on the subject which they had received from theScottish Law Officers of the day. The point was also taken in paragraph 85of the White Paper on the Reform of Local Government in Scotland (Cmnd4583, February 1971) and this was followed by a Parliamentary statement bythe Secretary of State on 27 April 1971 in the following terms:
&apos;My right Hon Friend the Lord Advocate and I consider that there is no case for the existence (that is to say, after the reform of local government)of two lay summary courts of concurrent jurisdiction as at present; we propose that the existing justice of the peace system should be developed,with stipendiary magistrates appointed by the Crown in large centres of population, to meet the need. I shall shortly be consulting the localauthority associations about the establishment of a working party toexamine the practical problems involved. The working party will also beasked to consider whether any changes in the distribution of criminal cases between the sheriff and lower summary courts might achieve a more efficient system of lay summary justice.&apos;3 As the statement indicated, the Government consider that the traditionallay participation in Scottish criminal justice should be continued and strengthened. The lay judge brings to the court room a practical, everydayknowledge of the way of life and social conditions in the local community towhich those who appear before him belong, and such knowledge is not lessvaluable, when decisions have to be made as to the most appropriate methodof dealing with offenders, than the foundation of legal training possessed bythe professional judge. The qualities of a good judge judicial conduct,skilled discretion in decisions on bail, verdict and sentence are indeeddeveloped by professional and layman alike by experience in court. for various reasons, continuous and substantial experience, and training to assistthe layman to assimilate it, has been lacking on the whole to the lay summarybench as at present organised in Scotland. The Government believe, however,that if adequate training and a regular routine of duties were provided for those who sit on the bench, lay summary courts could play an invaluable partin the Scottish system of criminal justice and relieve the sheriff court of a pro-portion of its criminal summary work. They are also encouraged by the response of the public to the opportunities for service on children&apos;s hearingsto expect that suitable men and women, some of them already serving asjustices of the peace or with experience as bailies, will be ready in adequatenumbers to accept the responsibilities, arduous though they will be, of regular attendance on a reorganised lay bench, together with the associatedtraining sessions and private study.4 It is proposed, as the statement implied, that the new lay summary court should form an integral part of the system of Crown justice, with a benchappointed by the Secretary of State on behalf of the Queen on a permanenttenure which will justify the elaboration of a complete system of training. TheGovernment would wish that the name by which the new court is knownshould indicate its role as an organ of Crown justice and be free from other^associations. After considering other possibilities they have concluded thatthe most appropriate title is justices&apos; court&apos;, and that is the name used in this paper. It is also proposed that stipendiary magistrates should be appointedby the Queen to sit-in the justices&apos; court in any area where the Secretary ofState is satisfied that the volume of business justifies such an appointment.The integration of the justices&apos; court with the rest of the judicial system willalso be furthered by the assumption by the Lord Advocate of direct control of prosecutions before that court. This will both ensure a uniform standard of
efficiency in prosecution and reduce the possibility of cases being brought before an inappropriate court.5 The appointment of the working party referred to in the parliamentary statement did not imply any commitment on the part of either the localauthority associations or the individual members to acceptance of the policy outlined in the statement. The working party consisted of a justice of thepeace with experience of an active court, a bailie, a stipendiary magistrate, aclerk of the peace, a burgh prosecutor, a county clerk, a town clerk and departmental officials; it was chaired by the Secretary of Commissions forScotland. Their names are listed in the Appendix to this paper. The working party carried out a detailed examination of the present arrangements and considered various aspects of the support that would be needed by a new system of lay summary courts, and the arguments for and against possible methods of meeting the needs. Their work was an essential preparation forthe Governments proposals, and the Government wish to record theirgratitude to those who joined with departmental officials in a thorough andpainstaking inquiry into the detailed questions involved.6 It may be of convenience to the reader to have at this stage a briefsummary of the detailed proposals which are put forward in the followingchapters of this paper for public consideration and comment. Subject to the outcome of discussions following such comment it is hoped to introduce aBill to give effect to the proposals in the 1973-74 session of Parliament. TheGovernments intention is that the justices&apos; court should be completelystaffed and equipped to take over from the burgh court on the same date asthe new local authorities assume their functions under the Local Government(Scotland) Bill, that is to say, on 16 May, 1975.Summary of Proposals(1) The justices&apos; court will be given a jurisdiction and powers of penaltywhich are more extensive than those of the JP and burgh courts but less than those of the sheriff summary court. The maximum power offine will normally be  100 and the maximum custodial sentence 60days; the court will have power to endorse driving licences but not todisqualify from driving (paragraphs !0 and 16).(2) The organisation of the justices&apos; court will be based on the area of thedistrict or islands authority as constituted by the Local Government(Scotland) Bill. Unless geography requires otherwise, there will benormally one court in each district, but in some districts the court may meet in more than one town from time to time, (paragraph 19).(3) It will be the normal practice in the justices&apos; court for cases to be heard by three justices sitting together, one of whom will be chairman. Morethan three may sit if convenient, (paragraph 23).(4) Justices will be expected to accept a commitment to sit on at least 24occasions each year, including attendance at training sessions. Existingjustices who do not sit in the justices&apos; court will continue on the Com-mission of the Peace and be available for other duties, (paragraph 28).(5) Justices will continue to be appointed by the Secretary of State on the
Queen&apos;s behalf on the recommendation of Advisory Committees, whichwill be appointed for each district. Justices will be drawn from allwalks of life, but political party membership will be disregarded.(paragraphs 33-36).(6) The existing Commissions of the Peace for each county and city willbe replaced by Commissions for each district, but in the interests ofsimplifying the formalities individual names will no longer be inscribedin Commissions, (paragraph 40).(7) A comprehensive scheme of training for justices will be drawn up bythe Secretary of State. Detailed local arrangements in accordance withthe scheme will be the responsibility of local committees of justicesand their staffs. The Government hope that universities will assist inthe provision of week-end and evening courses and that a Justices&apos;Association concerned with the training of justices throughout their service will be formed, (paragraphs 41-43).(8) Stipendary magistrates will be appointed to sit in the justices&apos; court in glasgow and in such other districts as the state of business may require;they will exercise the same jurisdiction and powers of penalty as the justices. These appointments will be made by the Queen on the Secre-tary of State&apos;s recommendation, (paragraphs 47-48).(9) The justices&apos; court will be financed by the Government and receipts from fines will accrue to the Exchequer, (paragraph 49).(10) Central responsibility for the administration of the court will vest inthe Secretary of State and will be exercised by the Scottish CourtsAdministration on his behalf, (paragraph 49).(11) A statutory Justices&apos; Committee will be set up in each district; provi-sion will also be made for periodic meetings of all the justices in thedistrict and Quarter Sessions will be abolished, (paragraph 51).(12) The justices&apos; court will-be staffed by an extension of the responsibilities of the sheriff clerk service. The training of officers of that service willbe expanded to cover all aspects of the work of the justices&apos; court and thefunctions of clerk of court, court administrator, training officer andcustodian of the records will be exercised in each district by an officerof suitable experience and training, who will be given the title of clerk of the Peace, (paragraphs 53 and 54).(13) Prosecution before the justices&apos; court and the sheriff court will beintegrated under the direction of the Lord Advocate, (paragraph 57).(14) Administrative preparations will have to begin very soon in order thatthe justices&apos; court may be ready to assume its jurisdiction on 16 May1975. The Government will need the assistance in these preparationsof all those concerned with the existing lay summary courts and oflocal authorities; they trust that this will be readily given, (paragraphs59-61).
II.   The Jurisdiction of the Justices&apos; CourtIntroduction7 As foreshadowed in the Parliamentary statement, the Government con-sider that the efficiency of summary criminal justice could be improved byredistributing business between the sheriff court and the new justices&apos; court.At present the sheriff court deals with a large number of cases of a fairlytrivial nature, (jurisdiction over which has not been conferred on the laycourts), and if a substantial proportion of them were transferred to the jus-tices&apos; court the sheriffs would be enabled to devote more time to more seriouscases. The English magistrates&apos; court exercises a much wider jurisdiction,and has heavier powers of penalty, than either of the existing Scottish laysummary courts. The magistrates&apos; court is, however, the only system of summary justice in England and Wales, whereas the justices&apos; court will havea jurisdiction which is also exercised by the sheriff court. Its function will therefore be complementary, and its jurisdiction must be defined in terms which will give each court responsibilities which in character and volume are appropriate to its status and which are intelligible and acceptable to thepublic.8 The present lay summary courts can try statutory offences when power todo so is conferred or implied by the statute which creates the offence. In deal-ing with common law crime the jurisdiction of these courts is chiefly confined to the preservation of the public peace, eg breach of the peace, minor assaultsand petty thefts; more serious offences, generally speaking, are not brought before them and if it appears, in any case, that mental disorder may be in-volved, they must transfer it to the sheriff court.9 In 1970 of the 209,973 persons proceeded against in the summary courts in Scotland 116,714 were dealt with in the sheriff summary court, 84,643 inthe burgh courts and 8,616 in the JP courts. In 1946 the figures were 31,656 inthe sheriff court, 48,855 in the burgh court and 7,797 in the JP court. Theincrease in the proportion of all summary cases going to the sherriff court inthe last 25 years is no doubt due to a combination of factors. These includeparticularly the disproportionate increase in Road Traffic Act offences whichare triable only in the sheriff court and a tendency in the legislature not toextend provisions creating new offences so as to confer jurisdiction on theScottish lay courts. In the Governments view this tendency may properly be reversed on the setting up of a new court in which lay justices will be ade-adequately trained for the duties of the bench and the Lord Advocate will beresponsible for prosecutions.10 It is not proposed to alter the present law under which the sheriff courthas universal summary jurisdiction, so that, if appropriate, any summary
offence may be tried there. For the justices&apos; court the Government propose inthe first place that the maximum fine that the court may impose in common lawcases within their jurisdiction should be increased from  50 to  100; this could indeed be justified by the effects of inflation since the limit was raised to  50 in 1963. Similarly, the justices will be given jurisdiction over appro-priate statutory offences the maximum penalty for which does not exceed a fine of  100. It is not however proposed either that they should be given ahigher maximum powers of imprisonment in common law cases than 60 days(as at present) or that they should be empowered to send offenders for Borstaltraining. In respect of both common law and statutory offences, of whichthe biggest groups are discussed in the following paragraphs, cases which fell within the jurisdiction of the justices&apos; court would not necessarily be taken before that court. At the prosecutor&apos;s discretion, cases which appeared likelyto raise difficult points of law or to involve complexities of proof, mentaldisorder or local controversy, or where there were other charges over whichthe sheriff has exclusive jurisdiction, would be reserved to the sheriff court.11 Turning next to specific statutory offences, it may be noted that about80-85 per cent of all summary prosecutions relate to the six largest groups of crimes and offences as defined in the Criminal Statistics. Three of these groups drunk and incapable, Police Acts, etc, and breach of the peace arealready predominantly dealt with in the burgh and justice of the peace courts.The other three are theft, housebreaking and road traffic offences, and theseare considered below, together with the offence of failure to possess a TV orwireless licence.Theft &amp; Housebreaking12 By the provisions of section 4 of the Summary Jurisdiction (Scotland)Act 1954 housebreaking is outside the jurisdiction of the existing lay courts,and their jurisdiction to try cases of theft is limited to cases in which the valueof the property involved does not exceed  25 and in which the accused hasno known previous convictions of crimes of dishonesty. It is proposed thatin the justices&apos; court the value limitation in cases of theft should be increasedto  100 (the same as the new power of fine), and that the disqualifying&apos; pre-vious conviction should be abolished. Although housebreaking (which includes breaking into any type of building) may have been excluded from thejurisdiction of the existing lay courts on the grounds that it is a more seriousoffence than theft, many housebreakings appear comparatively trivial of10,000 persons convicted in 1970 25 per cent were dealt with by admonition(and 25 per cent by imprisonment). It is true that the new arrangements fordealing with children may have reduced the number of such minor casescoming before the courts. Nevertheless it seems reasonable to include house-breaking on the same basis as other thefts, viz, that it should be within thejurisdiction of justices&apos; court if the value of the property stolen does not exceed 100.Road Traffic Offences13 At present the only road traffic offences within the jurisdiction of the lay courts are those for which the maximum penalty is a fine not exceeding  50.
Summary offences for which imprisonment may be imposed or for whichendorsement and disqualification are penalties must be tried in the sheriffcourt. Because of the sheer number of offences involved (112,000 dealt withby the courts in 1970) it is clear that there can be no major relief for the sheriff court unless the jurisdiction of the justices&apos; court is to be extended toover some additional road traffic offences, particularly careless driving andspeeding.14 Convisction of both these offences carry with them an obligation on thecourt, exceptional circumstances apart, to order the endorsement of thedriving licence; and the court has discretion to disqualify from driving.(Under the &apos;totting-up&apos; provisions, the court is normally obliged to disqualifyfor at least six months for the third conviction of an indorsement&apos; offencewithin three years.) this Therefore raises the question whether the justices&apos;court should have the power to order endorsement and/or to disqualify.15 The Government see no difficulty about the court having power to orderendorsement, since this is not a substantive penalty but a &apos;marking&apos; of the offence, and is a near-automatic consequence of the conviction. However, thepower to disqualify is a heavy one, and the Government doubt whether theScottish public would find a proposal to confer it on a lay summary courtacceptable, at any rate for the present time. That the justices&apos; court shouldnot have the power to disqualify would not prevent it being given jurisdiction over the offences of careless driving and speeding. The sherriff summarycourfs discretionary power to disqualify is not widely used on conviction ofthese offences but it would be both necessary and desirable for the more serious cases to be taken before the sheriff. In addition it would still benecessary to prosecute in the sheriff court potential &apos;totting-up&apos; cases (ie these in which there were two previous endorsements within the prescribed period).16 Accordingly the Government propose that the justices&apos; court shouldhave power to order endorsement but not to disqualify, and that they shouldbe given jurisdiction over offences of careless driving and speeding. they propose also that they should be given jurisdiction over certain other road traffic offences for which discretionary powers of disqualification are notwidely used or which (not involving endorsement or disqualification) are within the courfs proposed general powers of penalty in common law cases.It is estimated that under this proposal about 40,000 of the 112,000 offencesreferred to in paragraph 13 above would continue to be exclusively within thejurisdiction of the sheriff court. It is not possible to estimate how many ofthe remaining 72,000 offences would in practice be dealt with in the justices&apos;court. The considerations mentioned at the end of paragraph 10 would apply in many cases, and as noted above cases in which disqualification could be a tissue would require to be brought before the sheriff court.TV Licences17 In 1970, 4,315 persons were proceeded against in the sheriff court for offences against the Wireless Telegraphy Acts, mainly failure to take out a TV licence. The maximum fine for this offence is  100 (second offence).It is proposed to bring it within the jurisdiction of the justices&apos; court.
Civil Jurisdiction18 It is not proposed to give the justices&apos; court any jurisdiction in civilmatters. The Justices of the Peace Small Debt (Scotland) Act 1825 will be repealed and arrangements will be made for the small debt cases now disposedof by the JP small debt courts in some areas to be taken before the sheriff.These proposals are in accordance with the consideration given to this subject by the Grant Committee on the sheriff court in paragraphs 192-197 of theirreport (Cmnd 3248).
III.   The Location and Number of Courts19 The Government propose that the geographical area to which justices ofthe peace should be appointed, and within which they should exercise their functions, should be the districts or islands authority as constituted by theLocal Government (Scotland) Bill. In some of these areas several burgh orJP courts meet under the existing arrangements, but many of these courtshave very little business. As a general principle the Government propose that,unless geographical considerations require otherwise, there should be onlyone justices&apos; court in each district. This, they consider, is necessary in orderto secure adequate experience for the justices, and economical employmentof court staff, prosecutors and members of the other public services frequentingthe court. It will usually be convenient for the court to be located in the townwhich contains either the district authority&apos;s main offices or the sheriff court.These may indeed often be the same, but clearly formal decisions will not betaken by district authorities about their capitals until their year of &apos;shadowoffice&apos; (1974-75) during which the arrangements for launching the justices&apos;court will also require to be completed, as discussed later in this paper.20 Although it is intended that there should be only one court in each district, in many districts it may be found desirable, according to the incidence of business, for it to have scheduled court sittings in more than one town.Where this is so, it is proposed that &apos;away courts&apos; should be served, like thecentral court, by justices from throughout the district and that the clerk andprosecutor should travel from the central court. This seems necessary in orderto secure that peripheral courts are served by justices and staff with adequateexperience.21 The present lay courts, particularly in the burghs, are quite frequentlyconvened at comparatively short notice to deal with one, or a few, custodycases. To some extent this derives from an old burghal tradition that allpersons arrested by the burgh police should be held in custody overnight andproduced to the court next morning. In the Governments view it would notbe conducive to the proper employment of the justices on business of sub-stance for them to be on regular call for short sittings to deal with such cases;with the reduction in the number of courts it would, in any case, give rise to more inconvenience. The burghal tradition has already been modified inmany areas, the police exercising their powers, in appropriate cases, to liberate arrested persons against their appearance in court. It is proposed to pursue with the police the widening of this practice, so that the number ofpersons who, because they have been arrested and not liberated, must bedealt with by the justices&apos; court on the next lawful day is reduced to a necessary minimum.
22 The work-load of the existing lay summary courts in several of the new-style districts is very low. In some of these districts there may be an appreciablenumber of cases taken before the sheriff court which could be heard by the lay court either under the existing law or as a result of the extension of itsjurisdiction proposed earlier in this paper. In Ministers&apos; view lay summaryjustice is a form of participation by members of the public in the responsi-bilities of Government which should be practised in all parts of Scotland.They would regard it as contrary to the public interest if the justices&apos; courtdid not sit in any areas because business was light.
IV.   The Constitution of the Bench23 The Government intend that it should be the normal practice in the justices&apos; court for three justices to sit on the bench together to hear cases, andfor one of them to be chairman. There will be no bar on a larger number than three sitting together. A very large bench, however, would be unwieldy andit would be difficult for all to play a full part. Benches of more than five willnot therefore be encouraged, unless in exceptional circumstances, such aswhere they may offer the most convenient way of securing experience fornewly appointed justices or of giving all justices regular tours of duty in areas where the volume of business is very small.24 In reaching this decision Ministers are aware that at present in Scotlandlarge numbers of criminal charges are heard by a bailie sitting alone. But the justices&apos; court will exercise considerably wider jurisdiction and powers thanthe burgh court, and will dispose of a substantial proportion of the road traffic offences now heard exclusively by the sheriff court. It is essential thatthe public should have confidence in the handling of this extended jurisdiction.The plural bench is a built-in method of neutralising the prejudices thateveryone entertains on one subject or another and that lay people are nottrained to put on one side and of which they may be unaware. The Govern-ment believe that by requiring a bench of three as a norm they will assist the justices&apos; court to reach balanced and impartial decisions of a professionalstandard both in verdicts and in sentencing.25 The bench of three will place a heavy responsibility on the chairman,who will be primarily responsible for creating and sustaining the rightatmosphere in court and will normally be the spokesman for the bench, but must also be responsive to the views of his colleagues. Conversely, the pluralbench will-be of great help to the newly appointed justice, since he will gainexperience of weighing evidence and of contributing to decisions without thenecessity of speaking in public or openly taking responsibility on his ownshoulders.26 The proposal for a plural bench relates only to the hearing of criminal cases in the justices&apos; court. It does not affect the present power of a singlejustice to issue warrants of arrest and search warrants or to witness statutorydeclarations and signatures on documents. Certain powers such as the granting of bail will also be exercisable by a single justice.
V.   The Justices CommitmentIntroduction27 in many areas of Scotland justices of the peace do little or no work inthe JP court and their public duties consist in the signature of documents andthe administration of oaths, and may include membership of the licensingcourt. Bailies in some burghs are heavily committed to the burgh court, butthis may be for comparatively short duty periods each year, and a bailienormally serves only for a limited number of years.28 The efficiency of the new justices&apos; court, on the other hand, will dependon the acceptance by the justices of a commitment to serve on the bench for asufficient number of days, year in, year out, to deal with the business arisingand to maintain their own experience. They will also be expected to attendtraining sessions and to do some private study. After considering the fre-quency with which bailies are able to sit in court in some busy burghs, thedemands that may be made on justices for training conferences and seminarsand the need to provide for holidays, it is proposed that the norm to beexpected of persons appointed as justices of the peace in Scotland should be24 attendances a year, including attendances at training sessions. In practice,justices in some areas may be called upon less frequently, but more frequentattendances may be necessary at some busy courts. In the initial period of thenew arrangements, when many justices will be inexperienced, there will be atonce a risk of congestion of business and of justices who have just acceptedthe new commitment being discouraged by its weight. Special arrangements may be necessary to deal with this transitional situation.29 Justices of the peace are unpaid and there is no service for Which theyshould accept a fee. They are, however, entitled to travelling, subsistence andfinancial loss allowances in respect of expenses or loss of earnings necessarilyincurred for the purpose of enabling them to perform their duties, and therates of these allowances are reviewed from time to time.Numbers of Justices required30 The number of justices that will be required to man the bench in each area will depend on the volume of business (after the extension of thejurisdiction of the court as proposed earlier in this paper) the number ofattendances given by each justice and the number of justices sitting on the bench on each occasion. An important factor will also be the skill of theclerks of court in organising the sittings so as to fill the available time as effectively as possible and in particular to avoid occasions when the courtrises after a very short session owing to lack of business. These matters will
require detailed attention during the preliminary period before the new courtassumes its responsibilities and in particular in the first few months of theworking of the new system. At this stage it has been estimated very tentativelythat between 1,000 and 1,600 justices may be required in Scotland, ascompared with the present total of about 5,000.The Existing Justices of the Peace31 It follows that about two-thirds of the existing justices of the peace willnot be required to accept the new commitment to regular attendance on the bench and at training sessions, even if they were willing to do so. All justiceswho will be under the age of 63 in 1975 will shortly be asked if they would be willing to serve on the new basis if invited. Those who do not feel that theycan offer the time or the appropriate ability, or who cannot be given theopportunity to sit in the new court, will not cease to be justices of the peace on the appointed day. They will not be called for duty on the bench, but their names will continue on the Commission of the Peace and they will be availablefor the other duties of a justice. It is appreciated that in some areas wherecomparatively few justices will be required to man the bench, difficulty maybe experienced in finding justices to sign papers as the number of existingjustices decline through natural wastage. This situation will be watched andif necessary remedies will be considered.Licensing32 Nothing in this paper should be read as prejudging any recommendation that may be made by the Committee of Inquiry on the Licensing Law ofScotland (the Clayson Committee) about the part played by justices of thepeace in the control of the liquor trade and of betting and gaming. The LocalGovernment (Scotland) Bill includes provisions which are consequential onthe changes in local government areas, relating to the constitution of licensingcourts and courts of appeal. Unless and until justices of the peace are dis-sociated from this work, both those who are appointed to serve on the newbench and the existing justices not so appointed (so long as they remainavailable) will continue to be appointed to these courts. For those who serve on the bench licensing business, if conducted on a different occasion fromjustices&apos; court business, will count towards the norm of 24 attendances.
VI.   The Selection and Appointment of Justices33 Justices of the Peace are appointed by the Secretary of State on the queen&apos;s behalf from among ordinary members of the public, and are recom-mended for appointment by Advisory Committees appointed by the Secretaryof State for this purpose in each county and in the four counties of cities.The Lord Chancellor uses similar machinery to appoint justices in Englandand Wales, and did so in Scotland also until 1955, when the power of appoint-ment was transferred to the Secretary of State. No change in principle is nowproposed in the procedure but it will have to be re-orientated towards theadditional responsibilities to be assumed by justices, and the existing AdvisoryCommittees, appointed for counties, will require to be replaced by committeesbased on districts. This will not, however, be provided for in the proposed bill; the Committees have been non-statutory hitherto and will remain so.34 The principles which govern the selection of persons for appointment asjustices were clearly stated on the following lines by the Royal Commissionon Justices of the Peace 1946-48.(a) The paramount consideration is the person&apos;s fitness for the dischargeof the duties involved.(b) The persons appointed must represent all sections of the community,including a due proportion of women.These principles go back at least to the Royal Commission of 1910 and havebeen consistently upheld by the Ministers concerned and by their AdvisoryCommittees. It is, however, timely to re-affirm them on the opening of a newchapter in the history of the office of Justice of the Peace in Scotland. It isalso regrettably necessary to say yet again that appointment as a justice isnot a form of reward for public services or of recognition of the worthinessof individuals, social groups or geographical communities.35 The task of the Advisory Committees in finding in their areas candidateswho possess appropriate qualities for service as justices (and who will berecognised by the public as possessing them) will be made much more arduousby the fact that all justices will have to accept a regular commitment to the bench. Hitherto, for the most part, the Advisory Committees have not found it necessary to let the general public, or selected organisations, know when there are vacancies for justices, or to interview prospective candidates beforerecommending them to the Secretary of State. The names of individualCommittee members are unknown to the public, and perhaps not many people are aware even that the Committees exist. The recommendations sub-mitted under this procedure have met the present need adequately, but under
the new regime the Committees will require to work more openly. The public should know that it is open to any organisation or individual to suggestanyone (including himself) for appointment as a justice; it is important thatthe Advisory Committees should have many more suitable names before them than there are vacancies at any given time. National publicity will be launchedat the time when candidates are required for the first appointments on thenew basis. Interviews on behalf of the Committee will be indispensable inorder that the Committee may be satisfied that the persons they recommendhave the judicial qualities that will be required and the prospective candidatemay appreciate the demands that the office would make on him if he shouldbe invited to accept appointment. Detailed advice on these lines will be givento the new Advisory Committees that will be appointed for districts. TheCommittees will also be expected to keep in touch with the working of the justices&apos; court in their areas and to report to the Secretary of State on anyinadequacies that may come to their notice.36 The requirement that justices should be drawn from all sections of thecommunity has hitherto been secured by a careful balance of politicalallegiance both in the membership of Advisory Committees and in the lists of persons whom they recommend for appointment. In the Government^view this method of ensuring that persons from all walks of life are appointedhas become increasingly artificial in recent years. It was not found necessaryto introduce any consideration relating to political party into the procedure for the selection of members of children&apos;s panels, and in the appointmentsthat he makes to the new district JP Advisory Committees the Secretary ofState will simply disregard political opinion if any. He will similarly expect the Committees to recommend to him persons from all occupations and socialclasses without enquiring into, or reporting to him on, their political views.37 The limitations on the appointment of, or the exercise of magisterialfunctions by, Members of Parliament or party political agents involve rather different considerations. Neither a Member nor an agent is appointed a JPwithin his own constituency; and a JP who is adopted as a Parliamentarycandidate or who is appointed an agent for a constituency within his Corn-mission area is invited not to sit and adjudicate, although he is not requiredto resign from the Commission. This practice extends to the spouses of those affected by it. It was announced on 20 December 1971 that the Lord Chan-cellor had extended his practice to include whole or part-time agents, whetherpaid or unpaid, and the secretaries of political party constituency organisa-tions (those covering whole constituencies and not merely wards or divisions)whether whole or part-time and whether paid or unpaid, and their spouses;previously only whole-time, paid political agents had been affected. this extension has not yet been adopted in Scotland, but as soon as appointments to the bench of the new justices&apos; court are in question the rules will be operated in the same way on either side of the border.38 The Lord Lieutenant is normally the chairman of the Advisory Com-mittee. This has worked well and in the Governments view it would be appropriate that the Lord Lieutenant, who is the Queen&apos;s representative andhas been chosen for his general knowledge of the people of his area, shouldcontinue wherever possible to preside over the committee which selects
the new regime the Committees will require to work more openly. The public should know that it is open to any organisation or individual to suggestanyone (including himself) for appointment as a justice; it is important thatthe Advisory Committees should have many more suitable names before them than there are vacancies at any given time.

TheCommittees will also be expected to keep in touch with the working of the justices&apos; court in their areas and to report to the Secretary of State on anyinadequacies that may come to their notice.36 The requirement that justices should be drawn from all sections of thecommunity has hitherto been secured by a careful balance of politicalallegiance both in the membership of Advisory Committees and in the lists of persons whom they recommend for appointment. In the governments view this method of ensuring that persons from all walks of life are appointedhas become increasingly artificial in recent years. It was not found necessaryto introduce any consideration relating to political party into the procedure for the selection of members of children&apos;s panels, and in the appointmentsthat he makes to the new district JP Advisory Committees the Secretary ofState will simply disregard political opinion if any.

Neither a Member nor an agent is appointed a JPwithin his own constituency; and a JP who is adopted as a Parliamentarycandidate or who is appointed an agent for a constituency within his Corn-mission area is invited not to sit and adjudicate, although he is not requiredto resign from the Commission.

This has worked well and in the Governments view it would be appropriate that the Lord Lieutenant, who is the Queen&apos;s representative andhas been chosen for his general knowledge of the people of his area, shouldcontinue wherever possible to preside over the committee which selects
people from all walks of life to administer the Queen&apos;s justice. But the reform of local government implies some change in the territorial basis of thelieutenancy as well as of the Advisory Committees. Provision is made in theLocal Government (Scotland) Bill under which the Queen will appoint LordLieutenants for each region, to such number as she thinks fit, and they willbe allocated areas within the region by Order-in-Council. The areas and numbers of Lord Lieutenants will not necessarily coincide with the districtsfor which Advisory Committees are to be appointed. The Secretary of Statetherefore proposes to discuss with Lord Lieutenants at a suitable opportunityto what extent they may be able to continue to perform this service, and towhich Committees they should be attached.39 The document which lays the responsibilities of judicial office on eachjustice in the Queen&apos;s name is the Commission of the Peace. A commission has been issued for each county and city and the Clerk of the Peace is itscustodian under section 3 of the Public Records (Scotland) Act 1937. Whenthe Secretary of State approves a recommendation by an Advisory Committeefor the appointment of justices, he signs a Fiat authorising the inscription ofthe names in the Commission. The names are added by hand in the Office ofthe Crown in Chancery, and the Commission is sent to London for thispurpose on each occasion.40 It is now proposed to simplify this laborious procedure. The re-drawingof the local government map will necessitate the issue of new Commisions in both England and Wales and Scotland. The Government propose that inScotland a Commission should be issued for each district, and that theseCommissions should be addressed to the justices for the district generally,not by name, no names being inscribed in them. Lists of justices, distinguish-ing those who are active and those who have reached the age of retirementand have been transferred to the supplemental list, will be kept both centrallyon the Secretary of State&apos;s behalf and locally. When he approves an AdvisoryCommittee&apos;s recommendations the Secretary of State will sign an instrument of appointment on the Queen&apos;s behalf, and this will authorise the additionof the names to these lists. Provisions on similar lines for England andWales are contained in the recently published Administration of Justice Bill.
VII.  The Training of Justices41 In a few areas of Scotland valuable and regular lectures for justices are organised by clerks of the peace, often with the assistance of the staff of universities. For the most part, however, the training given to burgh magis-trates and justices of the peace is rudimentary or non-existent. This is not surprising seeing that most justices perform little or no court work and thatbailies are appointed for limited periods. But under a system by which layjustices will be appointed to give regular service on the bench until theyattain the age of 70 thorough and continuous training will be of greatimportance. All justices appointed to serve in the new court will therefore berequired to undergo a course of basic training on lines which will be laiddown by the Secretary of State and which will take account of previous experience where appropriate. Tho Govonimont oonaidor that juatieoaappointed to cit in the new court in Scotland ohould aooopt a oimilarobligation.42 The aim of training will not be to make the lay justice a trained lawyerbut to foster a judicial approach and to assist him to understand the pro-procedures by which offenders come before the court and the nature and purposeof the various methods of disposal which are available. It is contemplated that in the first place instruction should be given on practical aspects of theduties of a justice of the peace, supported by visits to courts as an observer.When this stage of instruction has been completed, it will be followed by adeeper study of the duties of the office and the problems of the treatment of offenders; visits to penal institutions will be arranged during this part of thecourse. Later on, more advanced training will be developed for seniorjustices, in which among other things attention will be given to the art ofchairmanship. In addition to formal instruction on such lines, it is hopedthat in many areas activities such as sentencing exercises, lectures, seminarsand conferences will be regularly organised at the initiative of the justicesthemselves to keep up with changes in the law and to give them opportunities to meet colleagues and learn from their experience. Such a system of trainingwould take advantage of English experience in recent years, with properadaptation to Scottish law and social institutions.43 The adoption of training arrangements such as these in Scotland would obviously involve a great deal of work for the justices themselves, the courtstaffs and the central department. The responsibilities of training are animportant factor in determining the administrative arrangements that will berequired to support the justices&apos; court. The Government would expect the justices themselves to wish, with the help of the court staffs, to arrangetraining sessions within the scheme which the Secretary of State will draw upin general terms. This should be a part of the work of the Justices&apos; Committees
which will be set up in all districts. It is also hoped that at an appropriate stage the justices may form a Justices&apos; Association, which might have close links with the Magistrates&apos; Association of England and Wales and perform asimilar and invaluable function in encouraging discussion and educationalvisits on a nationwide basis. There is an informed interest in the work of the criminal courts in many universities and colleges in Scotland and the Govern-ment is confident that they will be willing to assist in the organisation ofweek-end and evening courses for justices which will be closely related to scottish institutions and ways of life.44 It is hoped that most justices will find the training offered to them ofgreat interest, though time-consuming. No justice will be expected to pay anypart of the cost of his training while following any course which he is requiredto complete or any approved course, and allowances will be paid where appropriate in respect of expenses incurred in attending such courses on thesame basis as for expenses incurred in fulfilling the other duties of the officeof justice.
VIII.   Stipendiary Magistrates45 This paper has indicated that the Government intend that the bench ofthe justices&apos; court should be distinguished by the professional qualities of experience, the judicial mind and detachment from personal or class prejudice.The scheme of training will aim at making the justices experts in carrying outthe responsibilities which they have accepted, without losing the advantage ofbeing ordinary members of the public serving their own community. But theGovernment also intend that professional judges should make a significant contribution to the justices&apos; court, and the Secretary of State&apos;s parliamentary statement of 27 April 1971 (paragraph 2 above) said that it was proposed thatthe justice of the peace system should be developed &apos;with stipendiarymagistrates appointed by the Crown in the large centres of population&apos;.46 Under the existing law, any town council may resolve that a stipendiarymagistrate should be appointed to sit in the local burgh court. Only Glasgowhas done so, and has three stipendiaries. The qualifications required for appointment as a stipendiary magistrate are the same as those required for appointment as a sheriff, namely, the candidate must be an advocate orsolicitor of at least ten years&apos; standing. The appointments of stipendiaries andtheir salaries (though paid by the town council) are subject to the approval ofthe Secretary of State. The jurisdiction and maximum powers of fine andimprisonment of the stipendiary magistrate are identical with those of the sheriff summary court. The volume of work dealt with by the presentstipendiary magistrates in Glasgow is very substantial and amounts to approximately 15,000 cases each per annum.47 Under the new arrangements, it is proposed that the Secretary of state should have power to create posts of stipendiary magistrate for service in the justices&apos; court in any area, either on his own initiative or on consideration of representations made by the justices in the area concerned. The Secretary ofState will also have power to direct a stipendiary appointed for one area to sit in the court in another area or areas, either as a special arrangement todeal with a particular situation or as a regular tour of duty. Stipendiarymagistrates will be appointed by the Queen on the Secretary of State&apos;recommendation as indicated in the Parliamentary statement; and their salaries will be paid by the Exchequer. As noted above, the present Glasgowstipendiaries have a wider jurisdiction and powers of penalty than those oflay magistrates in the same court. Although hallowed by age, this is ananomaly, and the Government would not wish to carry over into a newcourt, where stipendiaries might sit on occasion in any part of Scotland, anarrangement whereby a judge appointed to one system of courts shouldhave the jurisdiction and powers appropriate to another. The powers of thestipendiary magistrate when sitting in the justices&apos; court will therefore be
those of the court as proposed earlier in this paper. The Government proposethat the qualification for appointment as a stipendiary magistrate should bea little less stringent that the present qualification for appointment as a sheriff.A requirement of, say, five years&apos; standing as an advocate or solicitor would open the posts to younger members of the profession, and the possibility oftranslation to the shrieval bench after a few years, which would be implied,would, it is hoped, offer such candidates an attractive career.48 Important although their role will be, it is not intended that stipendiarymagistrates should deal with all the business of substance coming before anybench. In any area where stipendiaries are appointed, the justices will also sitand dispose of cases which in volume and character justify their training. on present estimates of the numbers of cases which may fall within the juris-diction of the justices&apos; court, not all areas will need the services of stipendiarymagistrates. It is clear that they will still be required in Glasgow. But in otherparts of Scotland, it would appear, on the best estimates possible at thepresent stage of the volume of business in the new court, that the whole-timeemployment of stipendiary magistrates might leave the lay justices with an inadequate diet of regular cases of substance. If, as preparations proceed, this impression should be confirmed, it might be appropriate for stipendiarymagistrates to be employed on a circuit basis. A stipendiary based onEdinburgh might, for instance, sit regularly in the justices&apos; court in, say,Falkirk or Dundee. Other areas where it might be found desirable for astipendiary to be employed on circuit include Aberdeen, Dumbarton,Coatbridge-Airdrie, Hamilton, Paisley, Greenock and Ayrshire. (These areas,together with Glasgow and Edinburgh, seem likely to give rise to about three-quarters of the total business of the justices&apos; courts.) Although therewould be whole-time work in Glasgow for stipendiary magistrates, it might prove convenient for some of these districts to be served by a Glasgowstipendiary travelling, say, one day a week or less frequently. Further con-sideration will be given to the details of arrangements on this pattern duringthe preparatory period before May 1975 and the working of the initialappointments will be carefully watched.
IX.   Central and Local Administration49 The Secretary of State will require to be much more closely involved inthe administration of the justices&apos; court than he is with the existing lay sum-mary courts. Although the Secretary of State appoints justices of the peace on the recommendation of his advisory committees and Clerks of the peace on the nomination of the Lord Advocate, he has no responsibility for the running of the existing courts and he bears no part of the cost. The justices&apos;court will be financed by the Government and the receipts from fines willaccrue to the exchequer. This will involve the Secretary of State in responsi-bility to Parliament for all details of its administration. It will also be necessary as already explained, for him to lay down a scheme of training of justicesand to satisfy himself that all justices take advantage of it, end in particularthat newly appointed justices complete their basic training within the pre-scribed periods The Secretary of State will also require to watch the state ofbusiness in the courts, with a view to taking steps to relieve congestion or to remedy any inadequacies, especially when the bench is newly appointed. Hewill be particularly careful to avoid difficulties such as might arise from un-suitable appointments or from failure to appoint stipendiary magistrates toserve where they are needed. He will need to assure himself that each courthas suitable rooms available on appropriate days in the places chosen for itssittings, and supporting staff. Most of these requirements will be arrangedlocally, but responsibility will rest upon the Secretary of State. He will exercisethis responsibility through the Scottish Courts Administration set up following the passing of the Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1971. The post of Secretary ofCommissions (the officer who assists the Secretary of State in the appointmentof justices and of advisory committees) will become part of the ScottishCourts Administration and the section of the Scottish Courts administration which assumes responsibility for the justices&apos; court will include a trainingofficer who will supervise the training of justices in all parts of Scotland.50 Locally, the court will require (in addition to such staff as typists, ushersand cleaners) officers to act in the following capacities:(a) as clerks of court, to organise the business of each diet, to keep a record of proceedings, to advise and assist the bench in its functions, tosee that the courts decisions are enforced, etc;(b) as court administrators, to advise the justices collectively on the drawing up of rotas to attend court, on accommodation and staffing require-ments and on their financial implications; and to see that effect is givento their decisions on such matters;(c) as training officers to arrange lectures and other training sessions;(d) as custodians of the records, to keep up-to-date the list of justices andall public records of their proceedings.
51 The justices will also require to meet from time to time to discuss manyof these functions with the advice of their staff and provision will be made forthe justices in each district to elect a justices&apos; committee from among theirown number on the lines of the magistrates&apos; courts committees established inEngland and Wales under the Justices of the Peace Act 1949. A periodicmeeting of all justices in the district will be required to elect the justices&apos;committee and for other purposes. Such arrangements will make quarter sessions unnecessary and they will be abolished, as has been done already inEngland and Wales by the Courts Act 1971.52 Only a small pocket of staff will be needed by each court, except in thelarger centres, and the staffs of justices&apos; courts throughout Scotland willnumber only a few hundreds. The Government would not consider it practic-able from the point of view of recruitment, career prospects or efficiency foreach justices&apos; court or justices&apos; committee separately to employ its own staff.It is very desirable that staff should have adequate opportunity to move side-ways and upwards, and this such an arrangement could not sufficientlyprovide. There are two ways in which the staff of the courts could be linked with a larger pool: either by drawing them from the staff of the local auth4rityof the area in which each court is situated or by making them part of theScottish courts service. The first arrangement would imply, in the Govern-ment&apos;s view, laying the responsibility for the administration of the justicescourt on the district authority, and district authority staff might then move in and out of the court in the course of their career as they might any other localauthority department. The second arrangement would require that the sheriffclerk service should be extended to cover the justices&apos; court also, and membersof that service would be trained so as to be competent to serve in either court.53 The Government has given very careful thought to the choice between these two methods of administration of the justices&apos; court. They have nodoubt that if the responsibility were given to the new district authority, itwould be carried out conscientiously and efficiently. They are also keenlyaware that the court rooms in which the justices&apos; court will require to meetnearly all are, and will remain, within local government premises. Where full-time use is not justified the court will depend on the goodwill of the localauthority for suitable arrangements for the use of accommodation, and negotiations might be facilitated if the clerks of court were members of a localauthority department. More importantly, the Government is conscious thatit has been the Scottish tradition that the clerk should be legal adviser (orassessor) to the bench, to advise the justices as necessary on legal points thatarise in proceedings before the court. This function could readily be continuedif the clerk of court were a trained lawyer on the staff of the district authority.The Government however propose that the justices&apos; court should be staffedby an extension of the sheriff clerk service. As this paper has emphasizedseveral times, this will be a new court and an integral part of the Queen&apos;sjustice. There is some danger that this issue might be confused if the courtstaffs were part of a local authority department. The Secretary of State&apos;responsibility to Parliament for the justices&apos; court must also be placed beyond doubt and it is appropriate that the responsibility for providing efficient staff should fall directly on him. The case for having a clerk with legal qualificationshas not been disregarded. There is no doubt that, when legal questions arise, the
broad general knowledge and cast of mind of the trained lawyer are invaluable,in the other hand the proposals, discussed in the next section of this paper,for a unified prosecution service, will make it possible for cases likely to giverise to difficult legal questions to be brought by the prosecutor before the sheriff court and not before the justices. It may also be observed, if comparison is made with the English arrangements, that committal proceedings beforemagistrates, which can be protracted and involved, are not part of the Scottishsystem of justice. The Government are satisfied that the training already givenin the sheriff clerk service can be suitably expanded so as to provide eachjustices&apos; court with a fully competent clerk possessing the required knowledgeof procedure in a lay summary court and of the statutes creating offenceswhich will be tried before the justices. Such a clerk will have made the courtservice his career; for a lawyer in local authority service attachment to thecourt would usually be a short-term and perhaps part-time assignment.54 The court service will be reorganised to cover its expanded responsibilitieswell before the appointed day. In each district a member of the service with suitable seniority, experience and training in the new duties will be givencharge of all the responsibilities detailed in paragraph 50 above, and appro-priate staff to assist him in carrying them out. This officer will be given the title of Clerk of the Peace.55 The Secretary of State is assisted in his present responsibilities in relationto justices of the peace by a Central Advisory Committee with a remit to&apos;advise as to problems arising in relation to the appointment and distributionof justices and as to the work of justices in general&apos;. This Committee was setup following the Royal Commission of 1946-48. Its chairman is the LordJustice Clerk and its membership includes representatives of the LordLieutenants, local government, the political parties and industry. The Com-mittee has hitherto met once a year as recommended by the Royal Commis-sion, and has submitted an informal report to the Secretary of State on itsreview of the current situation regarding the appointment of justices and related matters. In the initial period at least of the new arrangements, theGovernment contemplate that the Central Advisory Committee may beinvited to meet more frequently to advise the Secretary of State on the pro-gress of the aspects of the reform which fall within its remit. Some adjustments of the scheme of membership of the Committee will be made arising out ofthe reorganisation of local government and related changes.
X.  Prosecution Before the Justices&apos; Court56 An efficient and equitable system of prosecution is one where decisions as to the sufficiency of evidence to justify proceedings and as to the appro-priate court in which to proceed, are taken in a quasi-judicial atmospherefree from pressure of political or personal expediency, and where a prosecu-tion, which is deemed justifiable in the public interest, is brought before acourt with appropriate jurisdiction and powers of penalty by a prosecutoranswerable to a responsible Minister of the Crown. The present arrangements in Scotland fall short of this ideal because the persons with the duty of takingthese decisions and conducting prosecutions are not within the same organisa-tion and the prosecutors in the burgh and justice of the peace courts are notanswerable to any Minister. Prosecutions in the High Court of Justiciary andthe sheriff court are under the control of the Crown Office over which theLord Advocate has ministerial responsibility. The Advocates Depute pro-secute in the High Court and the procurators fiscal in the sheriff court.Prosecutions are either in name of the Lord Advocate or in the name of theprocurator fiscal depending upon their gravity. In both cases the prosecutorsare subject to the directions of the Lord Advocate and answerable to himbut not to the Government or anyone else for the decisions which they take.In the burgh and justice of the peace courts, prosecutors are separatelyappointed burgh fiscals by the Town Council and justice of the peacefiscals by quarter sessions. Although the Lord Advocate has general powersof direction as to the court in which a case should be prosecuted, it is traditionand local arrangement that largely determine, in cases where the sheriffcourt and the lay courts have concurrent jurisdiction, to which prosecutor acase is referred by the police. Consultation does take place between the sheriffcourt and lay court prosecutors, but the fact that they are in differentorganisations restricts flexibility and creates in the diverse circumstancesindividual cases a risk that cases may be prosecuted before an inappropriatecourt where the powers of penalty may be inadequate. The possibility ofunsuitable decisions by the prosecutor in the lay court is increased by thefact that, except in a few larger courts, he has no colleague or supervisingofficer whom he may consult. He is rightly not answerable to his employers for his individual decisions.57 The proposals discussed earlier in this paper for giving the justices&apos;court a more extended jurisdiction and powers of penalty than the existinglay courts imply in the first place that a substantial volume of cases nowprosecuted before the sheriff will be brought before the justices, but secondlythat cases will require to be distinguished which could competently be decided by the justices but in which there is some probability that the court would wish to impose a penalty, such as disqualification for driving, which is not within the justices&apos; power. In order that a proper choice may be made in
doubtful cases, prosecution before the two courts will require to be more closely integrated than is possible under the present organisation. It is also desirable, in a court with the wider jurisdiction now proposed, that the pro-secutor should not be an isolated individual, but should have the support ofan organised service. The Government therefore propose that the lord advocate should assume direct control of prosecution in the justices&apos; court.58 The most logical and satisfactory method of securing a uniform directionof all prosecutions would be to extend the procurator fiscal service to providewhole-time prosecutors in the justices&apos; court. In the initial stages, however,there will be some uncertainties about the work-load especially in the remoterareas, and it may be found more appropriate to appoint local solicitors including some who now hold appointments as burgh or JP fiscals as part-time fiscals answerable to the Crown Office through the procurator fiscal forthe sheriff court district. With a view to making the most appropriate arrange-ments before the appointed day the Crown Office will keep in close touchwith the estimates that the Scottish Courts Administration will be making of the likely volume of business before the justices&apos; court in each district.
XI.   Administrative Preparations59 As already indicated at several points in this paper, preparatory workfor the new system of lay summary justice will require to begin very soon.The timetable proposed for the reorganisation of local government implies that the burgh court will sit for the last time on 15 May 1975. It will then benecessary for the justices&apos; court to be completely ready in each district with:(a) an appropriate number of suitably trained justices;(b) adequate staff to perform all functions;(c) suitable court rooms and associated office accommodation.60 The preparatory tasks that will be necessary to achieve these objectivesare closely linked with each other and with the administrative steps that willbe taken to set up the new system of local government. The provision of court rooms will depend on decisions regarding the location of courts and onthe availability of buildings owned by local authorities. Such matters cannotbe determined although some preliminary consideration may be given tothem until the boundaries of districts have been settled by Parliament andthe new local authorities have taken decisions, in their period of &apos;shadow&apos;office, regarding their administrative capitals. The training of justices will depend on the existence of staff and justices&apos; committees to organise courses and make arrangements with universities or colleges. Justices cannot be trained until they are appointed; and the appointment of Advisory Committees a necessary prior step will depend on Parliamentary approval of thenumber and boundaries of districts. It should, however, be possible beforeformal appointments are made to ascertain how many existing justices are willing and suitably qualified to serve on the new terms and also to formprovisional estimates of the volume of business in different areas, and thusof the numbers of justices likely to be required.61 A planning network will be prepared for this exercise. This will assist theScottish Courts Administration and the Crown Office to identify as accuratelyas possible the tasks, their timing and their staffing implications. As the preparations proceed, it will be necessary to ask the existing clerks of thepeace, clerks of burgh courts, JP and burgh prosecutors, JP advisory com-mittees and local authorities for information and assistance on a great variety of points. Negotiations will also be opened with universities and collegesregarding the possibility of week-end and evening training courses for justices.The Government appreciate that these requests for help will add to the burdensof many people who will already be involved in reorganising local government services; but they are confident that they will co-operate readily within theirrespective spheres.
XII.   Conclusions: Finance and Manpower62 This paper has outlined proposals for the creation of a new justices&apos;court to take the place of the existing JP and burgh courts when the burghcourt disappears. The Government will become responsible for lay summaryjustice, and it follows that the cost of the lay courts will be transferred from local authorities to the Exchequer. The existing expenditure on the JP andburgh courts cannot be estimated very closely, but is of the order of fl 00,000;the receipts from fines, which are kept by the local authorities, amount toabout the same sum. The financial effect of the transfer on local governmentwill therefore be negligible. The cost of the justices&apos; court can only be tenta-tively estimated before detailed planning has begun on the lines explained in the preceding paragraphs and before the volume of business falling to the justices&apos; court as a result of its extended jurisdiction is known, but it may beof the order of  800,000  lm at present prices, again to be off-set by fines.About 400 central government staff of all grades will be required, or about100 more than the estimated whole-time equivalent of the present localauthority staff.63 These figures are an approximate measure of the additional public effortthat the reform of the lay courts like all reforms will involve. The Govern-ment consider that the expenditure in terms both of money and of man-power will be justified by the greater efficiency and higher standing of the justices&apos; court. Relief will also be afforded to the sheriff court. This cannotbe quantified at present, but its chief result may be to allow the court longertime for the consideration of the more serious and difficult cases. In some areas, however, economy in the disposition of shrieval manpower, or intravelling time, may be possible.64 Any reform of the criminal courts begs the question: will this help toprevent crime? The Government believe that the creation of the justices&apos;court on the lines described in this paper will make it more likely thatcriminal charges will receive speedy and equitable decision before a courtwith appropriate powers, and that this circumstance will increase respect forthe law and tend to deter potential offenders. They also hope that by extend-ing the employment of ordinary members of the public as judges in criminal cases, and by giving them a broad training for the work of the bench, theproposals will give the local community a new opportunity for participation in the prevention of crime and will provide in each area a focal point for concern about the problems not only of sentencing but of social effort forthe reduction of delinquent behaviour.
