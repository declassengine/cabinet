THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYJS government cp(7%) 32 COPY NO      6 J14 March 1973CABINETBUILDING SOCIETIES:INTEREST CHARGE ON MORTGAGESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome department. .The. Cabinet were informed at their meeting on 8 March that theBuilding Societies were proposing to increase the rate of interestcharged to borrowers to 9 per cent and perhaps 9j per cent.    they invited the Secretary of State for the Environment and the Chief Secretary,Treasury to urge the representatives of the Building Societies to refrain from making any immediate increase;  or, if some increase could not be avoided, to restrict the new rate of interest to not more than 9 per cent.2. At the meeting on 13 March of the Ministerial Group on Land and house Prices (GEN 148), the Secretary of State reported the outcome ofthe meeting which he, the Chief Secretary, Treasury and the Ministerfor Housing and Construction had had with the leaders of the building society movement.    The Building Society representatives made clearthat the proposal to increase rates of interest was not a panic reaction to the budget statement, and that they had for some time beenbecoming increasingly concerned about their financial position.    In orderto support a programme of about 230, 000 new houses a year, the building societies need a monthly net increase in deposits of  150 million to , 170 million.    In 1972 they were receiving an average of about  150 million a month.    In January 1973 this figure fell to  120 million and in february to  100 million.    This unfavourable trend, which appears still to be continuing, is largely attributable to a substantial increase in thewithdrawal of deposits.3. In these circumstances some increase in the interest rate wouldprobably have been inevitable anyway, and the budget statement, whichthreatened the Building Societies with even more rapid withdrawals,precipitated matters.    The Secretary of State and his colleaguesconsider that the Building Societies&apos; analysis of the position is broadlycorrect and that, without some form of outside help, an increase to-3 per cent (and perhaps to 10 per cent later this year) is virtuallyinevitable.    They pressed the Building societies representatives very strongly for the deferment of any decision, but the most they could
secure was a deferment until Friday, 16 March.    There is then ameeting of the Council of the Building Societies Association and anincrease to 9j per cent seems certain unless the Government promiseshelp which will render the increase unnecessary.4. The only help which could be given would be some form of loanor guarantee.    We might, for example, offer a straight loan;  or we might allow the Societies to reduce their liquidity below the statutoryminimum against an Exchequer guarantee.    The Chancellor of theExchequer has argued very strongly that, on grounds of nationalfinancial policy, both courses must be rejected.    The first would adddirectly to the already disturbingly high Exchequer borrowing requirement;  and the second (whether or not the guarantee was taken up) would in effect add to the public sector borrowing requirementbecause the Societies, in reducing their liquidity, would be realising asubstantial volume of public sector debt.    In the longer termmortgage finance might be given more stability by a scheme under whichthe Building Societies would set aside cash when money was plentifulfor use vhen.it was tight;   but such a scheme cannot be launched at thisunfavourable stage in the monetary cycle.5. The objections to allowing the rate of interest to rise to 9j per centare great.    The increased cost of mortgages will squeeze a number of people out of the market and this may reduce the annual number of housesstarted in the private sector (already at too low a level) by as much as about30, 000.    This would largely discount any success achieved by ourmeasures to increase the supply of land.    Moreover, substantial harmmay be done to the confidence of the building industry, with unpredictablelonger-term consequences.    Finally, the increased cost of mortgagesmay have harmful implications for our counter-inflationary policies.On the other hand, to keep the rate down risks a mortgage famine unlessother effective measures are taken to increase the funds available forlending.6. We can press the Building Societies to intensify their policy ofgiving priority to first purchasers and this will do something to offset the harmful effects of increased rates of interest.    But it cannot bedisguised that the effects are liable to be very serious, affecting as theywill a field where success is crucial to us.    Against this must be set the over-riding need to establish the economy on a firm basis.    Faced withthis agonising choice, GEN 148 concluded that priority must be given tothe needs of the economy.    I accordingly asked my colleagues to endorsetheir conclusion that we should not, in present circumstances, intervenefurther to avert an increase in the rate of interest on mortgages to whatever level the 3uilding Societies conclude is economically necessary.R home Office14 March 1973 2
