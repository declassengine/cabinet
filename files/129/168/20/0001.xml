The application of the Code to the banking sector poses special problems because interest charges are not within the control.    I attachat Annex A draft paragraphs dealing with the banking sector for inclusion in the draft White Paper attached to CP(73) 37.NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES2. Following further discussion in the group of Ministers directly concerned under the Prime Minister^ chairmanship, the proposedtreatment of nationalised industries under the Price Code has been amended,    I attach at Annex B paragraphs which have been substitutedfor paragraph 83 of the draft attached to CP(73) 37.A treasury Chambers21 March 1973
BANKINGANNEX AThe fo.Uov.-ing paragraphs are for the draft Code and would thereforeappear in Section 2 of the White Paper:-Banks. Finance Houses and Similar Enterprises91.   Most banks, finance houses and similar financial enterprisesare engaged partly in business fo; which the charge is a rate ofinterest and partly business for which the charge is of a differentnature.    Interest charges are not within the control.   The other charges of these enterprises are subject to control, however.    Itwill therefore be necessary to allocate costs and profits between thetwo classes of business for the purpose of the control on non-interest charges.    Paragraph /,1 applies.91A, For the purposes of the Code the enterprises described inparagraph 91 may treat as goods and services exported:a, transactions in sterling with any person or body corporateresident outside the United Kingdom; and b. dealings in foreign currencies.91B. The provisions of the Code relating to   allowable cost increases and to the limitation on net profit margins, defined in the case ofthese enterprises as in paragraphs 9ID and 91E, apply to their non-interest charges.   These include commissions, fees and all similarcharges.   Where ad valorem rates are charged and these rates arc-charged generally, they must be treated as maxima and may not beincreased without the agreement of the Trice Commission, who will apply to them the provisions relating to allowable cost increases.Enterprises will, however, be free to adjust their rates to match the credit status of a client provided such adjustments are in accordancewith normal practice in such cases.    Tn oalcuJating charges, theseenterprises should take fully into account factors such as customers&apos;balances which enter into the costing of the class of transaction forwhich the charge  is made.   They should treat changes in those factors as the basis for increases or reductions in the charges in accordance
with the Code.91C. The provisions of the Code will apply in full to charges inhire purchase, conditional sale, credit sale and leasing agreements.Changes in the monthly Finance Houses Base Rate may be taken as themeasure of increases or reductions in interest costs for the calculation of allowable cost increases, provided that rate is usedconsistently for all the purposes of the Code.91D. For the purposes of paragraph 50 &quot;net profit margin&quot; means:-(i) in the case of enterprises the bulk of whose businessconsists of hire purchase, conditional sales, creditsales or leasing transactions, net income from   charges for this business less associated costs, including over-heads, expressed as a proportion of average resourcesemployed.(ii) in the case of all other enterprises of the kinddescribed in paragraph 01, net income from charges (thatis, gross income less costs, including associated   over-heads) expressed as a percentage of gross income (thatis, total income from the transactions concerned).91E. In comparing net profit margins, as defined in paragraph 91D,with the reference level, account should be taken of the totalprofitability of the non-interest business of the enterprise concernedin determining the permitted level of charges.
The following paragraphs are    for Section /,. of the White Paper:-Banks, Finance House and Similar Enterprises174.    Interest charges are not subject to control under the Code.However in consultation with representatives of the banks and financehouses, agreement, has been reached as follows.174.A. The Treasury will discuss with the Price Commission arrangementsfor receiving and examining reports from the enterprises concerned on their net profit margins on interest earning business.   For thispurpose net profit margin will mean net interest income lessassociated costs, including overheads, expressed as a proportion of average resources employed.    If the reference level, calculated onthe basis described in the Code, has been or is likely to be exceeded,the Treasury will consider in the light of prevailing monetary policyconsiderations whether corrective action would be appropriate.   Courseof action to be considered would include the reduction or elimination of interest on special deposits.
The notification, reports and record-keeping requirements forbanks, finance houses and similar enterprises   will be defined interms of their deposits or outstanding lending balances.    Enterpriseswith gross sterling deposits in excess of  2000 million on 30 March1973 will be in Category I and required to obtain the approval ofthe Commission before raising their charges   other than interest charges.   Enterprises with gross sterl ing deposits between  200 milliorand  2000 million on 30 March 1973 will be in Category II andrequired to make quarterly reports.   All other relevant enterpriseswith outstanding lending balances to customers of  10 million ormore on 30 March 1973 will be in Category III and required to keeprecords.
ANNEX BNATIONALISED INDUSTRIESParagraph. 83 of the draft Code (Section 2 of the White Paper)would be amended and expanded as follows.   Paragraph 83A is new.The amended words in paragraph 83 are underlined:-83.   Part I of the Code applies to the nationalised industries listed in paragraph 82, according to the nature of the business of theindustry, as it applies to private sector undertakings, except that:-(i) a nationalised industry, when in deficit, may not increase prices by more than would be sufficientto avoid an increase in its deficit in the financialyear in question.(ii) Paragraph 58(i) will not apply to a nationalised industry in deficit, but the other provisions relating to private sector enterprises making a loss will apply, including in particular paragraph 58(ii)and the exemption from the productivity deduction:and(iii) paragraph 71 will not apply.83A. Where the responsible Minister notifies the Commission that aprice increase resulting from the application of paragraph 83 wouldhave an unacceptable effect on the general level of prices, theCommission will limit the permitted price increase to the amountspecified as acceptable by the Minister, but net so as to reduce theincrease below what is needed to reflect the allowable cost increases of the industry.
