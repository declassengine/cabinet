ANNUAL REVIEW OF AGRICULTURE 1973PART I - INTRODUCTIONScope and content of Annual review.     This year*s Annual Review w;.s the firut to be held since the United Kingdomjoined the European Communities.   This development has inevitably had aconsiderable effect already on the nature and scope of the Review and particularly on the method of evaluating the economic condition and prospects of theagricultural industry which has heer. used in this country for the past 25 years.The conclusions drawn from the Review are no longer simply relevant to the determination of guaranteed prices in the United Kingdom but will also providea basis for the formulation of policy in respect of price-fixing under thecommon agricultural policy (CAP) and of other aspects of the Community supportsystem.2.     It has been the Government1s aim this year to widen the scope of the Reviewwith these neeas in mind.   The^e is certainly no intention to discontinue the review system;   this year&apos;s Review begins a new series which will take full account of our position as a memoer of the European Economic Community, possessingan equal voice with the other member nations in the formulation and developmentof the common agricultural policy.    Further changes in the content ana proceuureof the Review will doubtless be needed in the years to come to meet the nteas ofa changing situation.   These will be made ii; consultation with the interests concerned.3.     Since the common agricultural policy applies to a wider range of commoditiesthan our present guarantee system, all those coi7ir,odities which are subject to anEEC regime and which are produced to a significant extent in the United kingdom have been brought within the ambit of the Review.   poultry meat and maize havebeen treatea more fully than in the past and some important horticultural crops(apples, pears, cauliflowers and tomatoes), hops, oilseed rape and herbage seedshave been examined for the first time.
4.     It was also necessary to recognise the essential difference betweenthe guarantee system under wi-ich the Exchequer makes up to producers in generalany difrerence between their return from the market and the price guaranteed by the Government, and the Community method of support which operates through an organisation of the market, mainly by import levies and support buying .The Community system will replace the existing guarantees over the next fiveyears, for products for which there is a common organisation of the market,as market returns overtake the guaranteed prices.   This development increases the need to examine market prices carefully;    they are now in any case animportant element in producers&apos; returns.5.     There are other aspects of the agricultural industry which have receivedmore attention or have been considered for the first time.   Among these are,for example, farm structure and the return to farm workers.   Our membership of theCcnununity has resulted in the extension of the definition of agricultural support to include expenditure in the United Kingdom under CAP arrangements and the statistical tables on trade in different commodities now show separately tradewith other Member states and trade with third countries.6.     In previous years, the White Paper on the Annual Review   has also included a statement of Government policy and details of   the determinationsof guaranteed prices for the ensuing year.   Since the Review is now to be set in a wider context and to be the basis for more than the guarantee determinations,the Government have decided to set out in the White Paper the main conclusions on the economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry thatemerge from the Review.   The determinations and related matters will be announced separately.General7.     Agriculture generally is in a thriving state.   Production trends areencouraging.   Incomes have shown substantial increases.   There has been adramatic increase in capital investment by the industry.   The costs of productionhave however increased sharply, although returns from the market have helpedproducers to meet extra costs and to increase profitability.   The industry iswell equipped to take advantage of the opportunities now available and to expand production accordingly,CONFIDENTIAL
PART II - COMMODITY TRENDS-   Cereals (Tables 1,4,6 and 26)8.    The cereals acreage harvested in 1972 almost equalled the high level of 1971(9.4 million acres).   Wheat yields were below the record 3evel achieved in 1971but good growing conditions for barley and oats resulted in yields well above that year.   Total production of all cereals is expected to be at a record level ofabout 15^- million tons.   The extra grain available from the 1972 harvest shouldbe sufficient to meet a large part of the increased requirements for animalfeedlngstuffs.   In 1972/73 very high world prices have been setting the levels ofprices on the home market well above those in 1971/72.   Assuming average weather,yields of barley and oats in 1973 are expected to be lower than the record levels of 1972.   The 1973 cereals harvest may therefore be lower in total.Potatoes   (Tables 1,4,8 and 26)9.     In 1972 the acreage planted was 21,000 acre below the target of 605,000 acresfflDespite underplanting and a drop in yield from the high levels of 1970 and &quot;1971,the crop was in surplus.   However market prices have been firm and supportbuying operations have not so far been necessary.   For 1973 the target has beenreduced to 580,000 acres.   On the assumption that there will be some increase inyield from the 1972 level, the crop should produce a moderate surplus.Sqsar M*&amp;  (Tables 4,9 and 26)10.   The guaranteed acreage remained at 443,000 acres in 1972.   The average yieldis expected to be lower than the exceptionally high figure for 1971 and estimatedproduction is a little below the average of recent years.   In 1973 no acreagelimitation will apply and the British Sugar Corporation has agreed to contract for468,000 acres (25,000 acres more than the guaranteed acreage).   Given a normalyield, production in 1973 would exceed the UK basic quota under Communityerrangements (886,000 long tons of refined sugar).
Oilseed rape (Tables 1,4,7 and 26)11.   Although oilseed rape is still only a minor crop in this country, the acreagedevoted to it increased in 1972 for the&apos;second year running to reach a new record level.As a consequence of rising world market prices, the prices received by producersare higher than in 1971.   The acreage in 1973 may well be more than double the1972 level.Hops (Tables 1,4,11 and 26)12.     The hops acreage has been showing a decline for some years,  reflecting improvedutilization cf hops in brewing.      After some   recovery in 1970 and 1971 the acreagefell again in 1972.   Poor growing conditions, combined with the declining acreage,has led to a substantial fall in production in 1972/73 as compared with 197V72.The average producer price for 1972/73 is expected to be a good deal higher than for 1971/72.   In 1973 a more normal level of yields is expected to lead to a recovery in production.Horticulture   (Tables 1,4,10 and 26)13.   The total cropped acreage devoted to horticulture is put at about 716,000 acres in 1972/73, slightly below the figure for 1971/72.   Within this total, a fall inthe area given over to field vegetable production and reductions in the acreage oforchard fruit are expected.14* Apples. The apple acreage has been declining for a long time and continuedto do so in 1972.   Output fluctuates widely from year to year and adverse weather in the spring and early summer of 1972 substantially affected yields, particularly of dessert apples for which the estimated yield is only 3.5 tons per acre fromthe 1972 crop as compared with 5.4- tons per acre in 1971.   Despite an increasein imports, total supplies in 1972/73 are expected to be a little lower than intiie previous year.   Prices have risen to exceptionally high   levels, being on average about double those of 1971/72, and growers&apos; total returns cnould be higher than in 1971/72.   In 1973 the acreage is likely to fall again but yields,and therefore home output, may be expected to rise.15.     Pears.   The pear acreage has also tended to decline.     Pear yield:; in 19/2were affected by the weather and are expected to gross only 3.6 tons per acrecompared with 5.0 tons in 1971.   Imports are also forecast fit a sligl .      Lower
level so that total supplies will be down.   Average prices are expected tobe some two-thirds above their 1971/72 level so that total returns to growersshould be higher.   There may be a further small decline in the acreage in 1973but, given more normal weather, home output should recover.16.    Cauliflowers.   The acreage under cauliflowers - like that of most fieldvegetables - has fluctuated over a number of years without showing any very clear trend.    In 1972/73 a small increase is lixely.   Rising yields have keptoutput moving slowly upwards.    Prices have oeen at much the same level as in1971/72.   On current trends an increase in home output may be expected in 1973/74-17.   Tomatoes.   The cultivated acreage of tomatoes is entirely under glass.    its current level represents some recovery from trie previous long term decline;little change is expected in 1972/73*   Increased yields hcve caused a slow butsteady growth in output, but imports and total supplies will probably be much the same as in 1971/72.   r&apos;arm-g^te prices are expected to increase.   A furtherrise in output is forecast for 1973/74.Herbage seeds (Tables 12 and 26)18.   The cropped acreage of certified seed rose substantially in 1972/73*Production of all seeds is estimated to have fallen, but the proportion ofcertified seed included in the total has shown an uninterrupted rise over thelast few years and the production of certified seed in 1972/73 is expectedtc be about the same as in 1971/72.    Prices for the 1972 harvest may be alittle above the previous year*s level.Be,f and milk   (Tables 1,4,13,14,15 and 26)19.    Between June 1971 and June 1972 the number of breeding cows continued toincrease,    within the total there was a resumption oz&apos; expansion in the dairy herd and further stronr growth in the beef herd.   This expansion is expected tocontinue.   The number of calves retained for beef remains high.    Total suppliesof beef and veal a^e expected to be slightly lower in 1972/73 than in 1971/72as a result oC increased retentions of breeding stock, greater exports and a sharp reduction in imports of store cattle.    Market   rices have beenexceptionally high, considerably exceeding the guaranteed price for most of theyear.   Home-fed oeef production is expected to increase in 1973/74*
20.    Estimated average milk yields per cow have reached record levels in 1972/73.A combination of an expanding dairy herd and rising yields has brought about asubstantial increase in total sales of milk through the Marketing Schemes in 1972/73compared with 1971/72.   Most of the increased production has been sold for manufacturebut there has been a small but encouraging increase in liquid sales.   The guaranteed price relating to the standard quantity covering about 73$ of total milk saleswas increased by 1p per gallon after the 1972 Annual Review.   For milk in excessof the standard quantity the Boards receive the actual manufacturing realisationprice.   This was higher in 1972/73 than in 1971/72, although the price of butterfell. Consequently the average pool price in 1972/73 will be substantially higher.In 197V74, an expanding dairy herd and continuing high milk yields arefe.vpect.ed to result in a further increase in total sale0 of milk.Sheep and wool (Tables 1,13,17 nnd 2b)21.     The breeding flock is now on a clear upward trend following a period ofdeclining numbers; in the year to December 1972 an increase of some 6 per cent wasrecorded.   The lambing season in 1972 was again above average.   Home-fed productionin 1972/73 is expected to be marginally higher than in 1971/72 but total supplies are likely to fall, mainly as a result of reduced imports.   Market prices in 1972/73have increased considerably and for much of the year have been above the guaranteed price.   Home-fed production in 1973/74- is expected to be somewhat above that in thecurrent year, assuming normal lambing conditions.22.     Production of fleece wool increased in 1972.   There has been a very substantialrise in auction prices obtained for the 1972 clip, after the increase in world prices, and the average price for the 1972/73 guarantee year is expected to be higher than the guaranteed price.Pl s   (Tables 1,13 and 26)23.     Expansion of the breeding herd resumed at the beginning of 1972 and by september it had increased by 3% compared to December 1971.   Tnis rate of expansionseems likely to continue into 1973.   Supplies of pigraeat for pork and manufactureare estimated at a higher level in 1972/73 than in the previous year but baconproduction is expected to decline.   Pig prices have been very firm in 1972/73
and, as for beef and sheepmeat, the average over the year is forecast to be abovethe guaranteed price.   The expansion in the breeding herd should mean an increasein home supplies of pigmeat in 1973/74*poultry meat   (Tables 1,13 and 26)24*    Production of poultry meat has risen steadily over recent years and aconsiderable further increase is expected in 1972/73.   Over-production led toexceptionally low prices for chickens in the first half of 1972 but there werefirmer prices towards the end of the year as a result of the general upward trend in meat prices.   As a result, average wholesale prices over 1972/73 as a whole areexpected to be a little higher than in 1971/72.   Turkeys attracted a greater shareof the market, at prices slightly lower than in 1971/72.   Some further increase in production of poultry meat is expected in 1973/74*Egg3(Tables 1,4,16 and 26)25*   The size of the average laying flock over 1972/73 is expected to be about per cent lower than in 1971/72.   A continuing rise in yields per bird has, however,prevented production from falling as fast as the average laying flock.   Thereduction in supply has been more than offset by an underlying decline in demand foreggs and a situation of serious over-supply has therefore prevailed for most ofthe current year.   The average producer price (including subsidy) is expected tobe about 1.5p per dozen lower in 1972/73 than in 1971/72.   Some further declinein production is forecast for 1973/74*
PART III - GENERAL DEVELOPMENTSFarm structure    (Table 2)26.    The number of farms in the United Kingdom continues to decline.   Thetotal number of significant units and the number of full-time farms, at293,000 and 180,000 respectively in 1972, are both 12$ lower than in 19^7.The fall in numbers has been most marked among the part-time and smallerfull-time farms.   Businesses capable of providing full-time work for atleast one man (ie those of 275 standard man-days (smd) or more) account for93% of total output, though in Northern Ireland and Wales the output of small part-time farms is rather more significant.   One-third of holdings havebusinesses capable of providing work for at least two men (600 smd) or more)but they account for over three-quarters of total output.   Large businesses(1,200 smd or more) though only one in eight of the total number, producenearly a half of total output.   Dairy, beef cattle and sheep farms togetheraccount for over 60% of full-time holdings and just under half of the total output of such holdings.27.   The average size of farm is increasing.   Full-time businesses averaged232 acres (including rough grazings) in 1972 compared with 213 acres in 1967.The average size of unit in the various enterprises, eg cereal acreage, dairy herd    sheep flock, is also expanding as the number of units declines and the trend to greater specialisation continues.28.   In Great Britain 65% of the holdings were wholly or mainly owner-occupied in 1972 compared with 54$ in 1960-61.   The proportion of total acreage heldby owner-occupiers has however shown a much less marked increase, from 52$in 1960-61 to 55% in 1972.   In Northern Ireland virtually all farmers areowner-occupiers.
-  Index of net product  (Table L&apos;6;29.     For 1971/72 the index of net product is now put at the exceptionally high levelof 118 (average of 1964/65-1966/67 = 100).   For 1972/73 it is forecast to fallslightly to 117.   Compared with 1971/72, greater output of cereals, livestock and milk is forecast for 1972/73, but these increases are expected to be partly offset by falls in the output of potatoes, sugar beet, horticultural products and eggs.On the input side, purchases of feed are expected to be higher.Efficiency and labour productivity    (Tables 3 and 18)30,     The annual rate of gain in the efficiency of the industry is now put at about 55 million in broad terms, taking one year with another.   This figure relates to thewhole of agricultural production and is not, therefore, comparable with the 30      million quoted in earlier years which related only to production covered bythe guaranteed prices.31.     The latest estimates indicate an average annual rate of increase in labour productivity (the volume of gross product per head) of 6fo for the period 1964/65 to1972/73.   The outflow of regular wfcfrle-tim* workers was running at about 5% a year in the late 1960s, but has recently been much reduced.Net income of the industry (Tables 18, 20 and 23)32.     The aggregate net inc ome of the industry rose to  706 million in 1971/72, anincrease of  88 million (14 per cent )over 1970/71 - considerably more than was expected a year ago.   A further rise of  84 million (12 per cent) is forecast for1972/73.   Adjusted for normal weather, income between the two years also shows anincrease of 12 per cent, from  662 million in 1971/72 to  744 million in 1972/73.33.     In real terms, aggregate net income shows an upward trend and is forecast to riseby about 4^ per cent in 1972/73.   Since the number of farms is falling by about 2 percent a year, income per full-time farm is rising slightly more rapidly.
34*    Information derived from sample farm accounts for the year endedraid-February 1972 indicates that in England and Wales the average net income for all types of full-time farm (excluding horticulture) was about 60f0 higherthan in 1970/71.   The very pronounced increase in average income reflects arise in the value of total output of about one-fifth in consequence of higher prices for most guaranteed commodities, appreciably higher market prices forstore and breeding stock and bigger cereal yields;   but a considerable partof the increase is attributable to a marked increase in the end-of-yearvaluations of livestock, crops and stocks and is thus not available ascash income.      Net income rose most   on   dairy   and hill rearing cattle and sheep farms;   farms with fattening enterprises, although benefiting fromhigher end prices, were faced with higher store prices.   Incomes generallywere up most in hill areas in Wales and the North of England and on smallerfarms.   In Scotland net income also rose by about 60$,with higher livestockoutput and prices boosting dairy and livestock incomes.   In Northern Irelandthe increase was only about 15$, in the main because of poor results on pigand poultry farms.   In all parts of the United Kingdom average incomes perfarm have risen in real terms and the average for all types (excludinghorticulture) is estimated at nearly 40fo above the level of the mid-1960s for england and Wales, nearly 50JS above for Northern Ireland and 90$ above forScotland.   The increase over this period have been much greater on livestockfarms than on cropping farms.35.   In 1972/73 incomes are forecast to rise again, but by less than in1971/72.   Dairy, beef cattle and sheep f^rms are again expected to do best.Lower wheat yield and quality and lower sugar beet returns will affect somecropping farms, while many egg producers are likely to have lower incomes.Cost changes    (Table 25)36.   Cost increases since the last Review are provisionally assessed at 217 million for all products, the chief items being  68 million in labour
costs,  42 million on the costs of feedingstuffs,  27? million on machinerycosts,  16 million on interest charges and  13 million on the costs of importedlivestock (mainly store cattle from the Irish Republic).   These figures forcost changes do not allow for changes in the volume of resources,ineludinglabour, used by the industry.   They were calculated before the increases infeedingstuffs prices authorised by the Government in January 1973*   Thesehigher prices would represent a further cost increase of some  685 millionif they were effective over a full year.Gross capital formation   (Table 22).37*  A marked inorease in the volume of investment is shown both in the revised estimates for 1971 and the provisional figures for 1972.   Gross capital formation in landlord ana tenant-type physical assets together is estimated to have reached  511 million in the calendar year 1972, an increase of 18 percent over 1971*   Of this investment,  167 million (an increase of 19 per cent)was in buildings and works and was mainly the responsibility of landowners, 180 million was in plant, machinery and vehicles (an increase of 32 per cent)and  I64 million was for additions to work in progress.   Expressed in real termsthese changes show a much greater volume of investment than in 1971 - some10 per cent more for buildings and works and some 20 per cent more for plant;machinery and vehicles.Agricultural land prices38.   Prices of agricultural land in the UK, which were largely unchanged from1969/7Q to 1970/71, rose in 1972.   The average level in England and Wales, whichhad been in the price range  190 -  200 per acre from 1969 to 1971, rose to  23kper acre for the half-year ended 30 September 1972, but because of delays innotifying sales to the Inland Revenue, part of the increase in this periodmay not be fully reflected in the figures.  Some much higher individual prioeshave been recorded,.
Rents     (Table 2l)39.     Rents in Great Britain rose on average by about 7$ between October 1971and October 1972.   This was about the same rate of increase as the average inrecent years but above the 5$ recorded between 1970 and 1971.Farm workers1 earnings    (Table 19)40.     The average earnings (including overtime) of whole-time hired men were 22.43 per week for the year ended September 1972.    These higher earningsreflect the increase in the minimum wages of  1 .40 per week ( 1.50 in.Northern Ireland) effective since the beginning of 1972 but not the further increases of  3.30 per week ( 3.10 in Scotland)   approved by the agricultural wages   Boards   which   will,   subject   to   the   passage   of   the Counter-Inflation  Bill,   take   effect  from  1 April   1973.   agricultural workers&apos;   weekly  earnings   continue   to  be   about  70$  of   &quot;the   average earnings of manual workers in industries outside agriculture, although differences in hours worked and other circumstances make a reliable comparison impossible.Public expenditure on support (Table 24)41.    The estimated outturn of *xpenditiae on agricultural support for 1972/73 i8 282 million.   This is about  60 million less than the outturn for 1971/72.   Thereduction is mainly attributable to lower deficiency payments for cereals andfatstock resulting from the rise in market prices.   As a partial offset however,there has been increased expenditure on capital grants -and also, for the first tim^some expenditure under CAP arrangements, part of which will be reimbursed fromthe European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (FEOGA).   Assuming nochange in guaranteed prices or rates of grants, expenditure in 1973/74 is expectedto return to a figure similar to that for 1971/72.
APPENDIXSTATISTICAL TABLESThere have been substantial changes this year in the number, format and content of the statistical tables as compared with previous Annual review white Papers.   It is hoped that the format and notes make the scope and content of each table clear.   Care should, however, be taken in using the tables in conjunction with those in previous White Papers.    In addition someof the figures in this appendix differ     from those in previous Annual review white Papers   because of later information, changes in the scope and natureof the available data and improvements in statistical methods.   forecasts for 1972/73 are as at mid-December 1972.All figures relate to the United Kingdom unless otherwise stated.Figures for imports from and exports to the Eight relate throughout to thecountries of the enlarged e.c. (Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany theIrish Republic, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands).Figures for exports include re-exports.Figures for total supplies take no account of changes in opening andclosing stocks, which can considerably affect net off take for consumption.In some cases figures may not add to the totals shown because of rounding?.Symbols:   - means &quot;nil&quot;... means &quot;negligible&quot; (less than half the last digit shown)means &quot;not available&quot;.

TABLE 1  (contd)(a) Up to 1969 the figures for Great Britain relate to agricultural holdingsexceeding one acre in extent, bat in June 1968 about 47,000 holdings were excluded from the census in England and Wales on the grounds that they werenot statistically significant.    Their exclusion did not affect the croppingand stocking figures for the United Kingdom for that year by more than0.4 per cent in the case of any single item shown in this table.In Scotland 16,000 holdings (accounting for less than 0.1 per cent of UnitedKingdom agricultural output) were excluded on the same grounds with effect from June 1970.Between June I969 and June 1,;70 some 10,000 holdings in England and Waleswere &quot;statistically amalgamated&quot;.   These holdings, farmed with other holdingsas part of a larger single farm unit, w-re formerly returned separately butare now returned as part of the larger unit.With effect from June 1970 the definition of agricultural holdings waswidened in Great Britain to include some 2,300 statistically significantholdings on one acre or less of agricultural land.   The figures now relateto allknown holdings with 26 standard man-days  (and) or more (a standard man-dayrepresents 3 hours productive ?/ork by an adult male worker under averageconditions); in England and Wales holdings with less than 26 standard man-days are included only if they have 10 acres ormore of crops and grass or atleast one regular whole-time worker.   The cropping and stocking figuresreturned by holdings on one acre or less account for significant differences between the census results for June 1970 and those for previous years orJyin the case of pigs and fowls.   The figures in square brackets in the tableshow the number of pig3 and fowls oxcluding those on holdings in Great britain with one acre or less.Figures for Northern Ireland relate to holdings of one acre or more, exceptfor numbers of livestock which are collected from all owners, irrespective ofthe size of the holding, and also from landless stockholders.(b) For threshing.(c) Includes area under orchard trees in England and Wales.(d) Hardy nursery stock, bulbs and flowers.(e) Most of the difference between total horticultural area and the sum of individual sectors is made up by the glasshouse area.(f) Includes acreages ofother crops and bare fallow not shown in the table.(g) Includes lucerne.(h) Includes common rough grazings.   The fall of.about 1 million acres in thearea of rough grazings between 1969 and 197u is largely accounted for by the exclusion from the census of the 16,000 statistically&apos; insignificant holdingsin Scotland referred to in note (a).(j)     &quot;Other land&quot; in Great Britain means woodland and areas under roads, yards,buildings, etc, the use of which is ancillary to the farming of the land; inNorthern Ireland it includes land within agricultural holding&quot;, which is underbog, water, roads, buildings, etc, and waste land not used for agriculture.Returns of &quot;other land&quot; were collected for the first time in England and wales in June 1969 and the area returned then (208,000 acres) is understated.   It isestimated that the figures quoted include not less than 149,000 acres previouslyreturned as crops and grass or rough grazing.(k)     Figures for years earlier than 1964 are for fowls six months old and over inGreat Britain and five months old and over in Northern Ireland.

There are still some discontinuities in thefigures resulting from the statistical amalgamation of 10,000 holdings inEngland and Wales in 1970 and the inclusion of some 2,000 holdings on an acreor less.   For details of these changes see footnote (a) to Table 1.   They havenot significantly affected the trend in the average size of enterprise.(b) These figures relate to holdings with crops, grass and rough grazings.   they include holdings with no crops and grass acreage which are excluded from thefirst section of this table.   For comparability the 1967 figures have been adjusted, where necessary, for major revisions to smd values in Great britain in 1968.(c) 250 smd in Scotland; 200 smd in Northern Ireland.(d) Includes an estimate of upwards of 15,000 full-time farms which have under275 smds (or equivalent) based on their cropping and stocking and assumingaverage labour usage.   Adjustments have been made for holdings which, though runas separate farming units, are in the same occupancy.(e) Includes maize for threshing in 1972 - not collected separately in 1967.(f) Figures included for Scotland in 1967 relate to June 1966.(g) England and Wales only.(h) Figures included for Scotland relate to the December censuses in 1966 and 1971and those for Northern Ireland to the December censuses in 1967 and 1971*(j)    Figures included for Scotland relate to the December censuses in 1966 and 1971.:ABLE 2 (Continued)

They Include some estimates for figures not directlyobtainable from the Scottish census results and for that reason they differ slightly from some of the publishedUnited Kingdom census results.  Because of changes in the census categories In England and Wales in 1970 and 1972numbers returned for earlier years are not available on the same basis as those for the most recent years.   Thefigures do not include the wives of farmers, partners and directors, even though the wives themselves may bepartners or directors.(b) Includes workers returned as &quot;seasonal or casual&quot;.(c) Based on a count of national insurance cards at June and the Population Census. Because of differences in coverageand tine of collection the figures are not on the same basis as those returned in the June agricultural census.This series was discontinued after June 1971. and was replaced In 1972 by an annual Census of Employment to whichthe Agricultural Census contributes.(d) The Increase in female workers and in farmers, partners and directors is probably due to an understatement ofthese categories in England and Wales at June 1970 viien clerical workers and farmers etc were included in the census for the first time.(e) Great Britain only; not separately returned before 1972.Number of persons engaged in agriculture(a)

All farms are treated as tenanted anda rental value is imputed as a charge on owner-occupiers.   The incomeaccruing   to landlords and owner-occupiers from the ownership of agricultural land and buildings (before taxes) is treated as net rent.   Farming net incomeprovides the return to farmers and their wives for their manual andmanagerial labour and for the use of the occupier&apos;3 investment after provision has been made for depreciation.   The occupier&apos;s investment includes alltenant-type physical assets in livestock, crops, machinery, etc but excludes any financial assets and all landlord-type assets such as land and buildings.   Theestimates of aggregate net income include a profit in recent years of about 5 million on the production of food for consumption in the farm household.In other industries the corresponding sums are not treated as profit and are relatively much smaller (in many cases non-existent),(c) The series measures year to year changes in the value added at constant prices by farmers, landowners and farmworkers, to all the goods and services purchased from outside the agricultural sector.(d) Labour productivity is here defined as gross product per person engaged inagriculture.   Gross product is gross output less all inputs other thandepreciation, labour, net rent and interest.   It is here measured at constant1964/67 prices.   In order to be consistent with national economic conventionsgross product as used in the calculation of labour productivity coversagricultural contractors as well as all commercially significant holdings.Net income, net product and labour productivity (a)

In practice,however, there are many variations in the division between the 2 responsibilities.   Investment in plant and machinery is normally tenant-type.   Investment in buildings and works is normally landlord-type.The figures in the table represent gross expenditure before orediting any grants which reduce the costto the owner or occupier.   Annual charges in the form of depreciation are made for these items in calculating aggregate farming net income.(b) Closing value minus opening value (Table 20) adjusted to approximate calendar year basis.

TABLE 23 (contd)(a) These figures are collected by Universities and Agricultural Colleges inGreat Britain and the Ministry of Agriculture in Northern Ireland.   Theyare weighted averages based on census distribution of agricultural holdingsby type of farming and size of bj/jjiness.   More detailed figures for Kngl andand Wales will be published in &quot;Farm Incomes in England and Wales 1971/72&quot;for Scotland in &quot;Scottish Agricultural Economics 1973&quot;, for NorthernIreland in &quot;The Northern Ireland Farm Management Survey 1971/72&quot;, and for wales in the &quot;Supplement to the Annual Digest of Welsh Statistics 1971/72&quot;.Net income is defined as for the aggregate net income calculation (Tables18 and 2C  , except that here net income is calculated before deduction ofinterest on any commercial debt.   All farms are treated as rented and animputed rental value is charged as an expense in the accounts of owner-occupiers.The accounts relate in the main to calendar years or to the year ending5 April, for which income tax is assessed.   The average year-ending date isabout mid-February.(b) Includes &quot;mixed&quot; farm type.(c) Almost all farm businesses in Northern Ireland are based on owner-occupiedholdings.   As rents cannot be imputed with reference to tenanted farms, therental charges entered for owned land and buildings have been assessed inrelation to estimated sale value.   V/here land was taken in conacre, theactual rents paid have been includedi   A high proportion of the labour on farms is family labour and the charge for this has been calculated forestimated hours worked at basic and overtime rates.   For these reasons theaverage net incomes per farm are not on the same basis as those for GreatBritain.(d) Includes &quot;cattle, sheep and pigs&quot;, &quot;pigs and poultry&quot; and &quot;cropping&quot; farmtypes.

The figures for 1972/73 arethe latest estimates of expenditure.   The figures for 1973/74 are provisional and are suhject to Parliamentary approval of the Estimates.
