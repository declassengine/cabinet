DRAFT OF 19.2.19731.   Traffic between the United Kingdom and the Continent has grown immenselyin recent years, and will    continue to do so.2.   Much fof it passes through the Channel ports of Dover and Folkestone with grave results for South East Kent, where substantial expenditure to cater for itis and will continue to be necessary.3.   We have to decide soon whether we can provide for it most economically andwith the least damage to the environment by continuing to develop existing formaof cross-Channel transport or to supplement and relieve them by a ChannelTunnel.THE TUNNEL4.   Two main tunnels each carrying a single railway track and a service tunnel would be built between Cheriton near Folkestone arid Sangatte near Calais.5.   These would link the rail systems of Britain and France.   Through day and night passenger trains would run from London and other cities to the maincentres on the Continent.   Motor-rail services and freight trains, includingcontainer services, would afford parallel services,6.   The Tunnel would also link the road systems of Britain ard the Continent by providing a &quot;rolling-motorway&quot; of frequent drive-on/drive-off ferry trains betweenterminals near the main portals.fVRflAWTQATTTVM   AMfi   T?maximum ktv.7-   The necessary finance would be raised and the Tunnel constructed by theinternational group of banking and other interests, organised into the Britishand French Cb&apos;&amp;uhe3 71,,,,&quot;ul Companies *8.   At least 10% of the finance would be risk capital, the rest carrying aGovernment guarantee.9,   The Tunnel would be operated by a joint Anglo-French public authority whichwould be responsible for servicing and repayment of the guaranteed debt andfor remunerating the risk capital out of profits in accordance with an.agreed
formula.   Net profits over and above those payments would belong to theGovernments.CURRENT STUDIES10,   The project will only be undertaken if it is shown by the current technicaleconomic and financial studies to be a sound business proposition and in theinterests of all the participants.11.   Particular attention is also being paid to aspects of special importanceto the United Kingdom.   Consultants have been engaged tc undertake a transportcost/benefit study and a detailed examination of the economic and socialimplications for South East Kent.   The implications for broader regional policyand for the balance of payments are being considered, as are the possibilities for improving rail services between the Tunnel and London,   And every effort is being made to limit any possible adverse effects on the local environmentduring construction,NEXT STEPS12.   The present studies (the main results of which will be published before anyfurther commitment is entered into) will be completed by the early summer.The Tunnel Companies will thereafter subiait their proposals for financingconstruction to the Governments.13a   A decision whether or net tc proceed further should be possible in mid-summer,   parliament&apos;s approval of such a decision would then be sought, togetherwith limited financial powers to cover certain   initial works,lit.   Tn the event of a decision to proceed a further agreement between thetrpy eminent s and the Companies and an Anglo-French Treaty would be required by31 July, though it might be possible for this tc be slightly postponed.If).   Between autumn 1973 and early 1973 certain initial works, including trialborings, would be undertaken.   At the same time the larger powers required for the project would be sought from Parliament,
16.   A supplementary agreement setting out the final details of thefinancial arrangements would be signed early in 1975*   The main finance wouldthen be raised and the major construction be undertaken.   The Tunnel should be opened in 1980,f/\r&apos;^TT!0 TAUT17.   Our cross-Channel links are of increasing importance, particularly now that we are members of the European Economic Community.   They will needsubstantial improvement.   One way to meet that need would te to rely for the foreseeable future on the continued development of and investment in existingforms of cross-Channel traffic.   Another would be to build the Tunnel.
CHAPTER I: THE-PROBLEMGrowth of Cross-Channel Traffic,1.1    There had been a massive growth of traffic between the united Kingdomand the Continent in recent years; the total number of holiday journeys madeby sea and air by passengers to or through those Continental countries most likely to be served by a Channel Tunnel? have increased from some 2.8m to some5Am between 1J62 and 1970* while journeys from the Continent to this countryincreased at an average of lifo pa for journeys by air and 12$ by sea.   In thesame period within this total the volume of accompanied car traffic has more than doubled (see fig 1 below).   Business travel, most of which is by air, also doubledover the same period.   Freight traffic in similar measure has increased sinceI965 by 5Q  and the number of goods vehicles and trailers at least as fast.There are no signs of any slow down.Fig 110 L      I    ,., I -.....I ________t       1       1       1       1       &apos;       .1962 1964 1966 1968 1970Note: Average car occupancy rate assumed as 2.8 persons*France, Western Germany, Italy, the Benelux countries, Austria and Switzerland
1.2   Whether or not a Channel Tunnel is built, total traffic is expectedto continue to grow.   The test forecasts available suggest that by 1980and 1990 the traffic will have increased broadly as follows;a. Accompanied cars; more than doubled by 1900 (at an annual average increase of some 9jl) . and more than quadrupled by 1990.b. Other leisure passenger trips by 50?c by 1980 (at an annual average ofsome 7$ and by 12$% by 1990.c. Business traffic by 855j by 1980 (at an annual average of some 8?o)and more than tripled by 19909.1.3   The surface traffic is concentrated on the shortest sea routes from south East Kent.   The ports of Dover and Folkestone together now carry33fi of the passengers (including those in accompanies cars), and        of allvehicles and trailers.   This traffic is also growing rapidly; the number of freight lorries using Dover in 1972 wa3 up as much as Wb% on 1971.   Othertraffic uses Ramsgata, and the hoverport at Pegwell Bay.1 Ji-   If a Tunnel were built, it would come into operation about the same time as the Third London Airport.   It might attract from air in 1980 as many as=7 million passengers, all to European destinationss   This would representperhaps six months increase in London&apos;s air traffic, and would not affectsignificantly the level at that time of aircraft movements at Maplin to alldestinations.Investment in cross-Channel facilities1 .5   Massive investment has been made during the past decade on    bothside of the Channel to carry this traffic./over  30m has, fer instance, booninvested in port facilities primarily for short-sea chipping from points onthethe coast between the number and Southampton:/British Railways Board alone have spent sons  20a on new ships since ij&apos;63 for Continental services; private companic o n u a x ne x1have provided substantial new fleets of passenger and vehicle ferries and of/&apos;
ships, as mil as of conventional short-sea vessels.   It is understood that 7by BRAaircraft are currently provided/for such services, valued at some  25m.   Majorroad improvements have already been made, and much more is now being done to bring the port routes to a standard where they can bear the traffic.1 .6   Port facilities at Dover and Folkestone have been enlarged and improvedat a cost over the past decade of  6.5m,   Substantial further work is planned.The fleets sailing from these ports have also been expanded end renewed.   Since196^  45m has been spent on improving or replacing the main A2 and A20 roadapproaches, while work   on these routes now under construction or programmedfor construction in the next few years are expected bo cost some  50a,Effects on the environment .7   This traffic is already damaging the environment of South ?:ast Kentand the main approach routes,   The speed of. its growth overtook the previsionmade for it.   In spite of the improvements already made, long stretches ofthe main roads and the immediate approaches to the ports are still woefullyinadequate, and not only at peak periods.   Cn at least one weekend last summerthe lack of parking and marshalling space at the docks coupled with the inadequacy of the approaches led to near chaos
1.8   Much work is already in hand to relieve the worst of those conditions.But the provision of new roads can itself do harm particularly in unspoiltconditions and to old and beautiful towns.    Without a Tunnel increasing surfacetraffic will continue to pour into the ports.    The provision of relief roads andby-passes will help, but it would clearly be easier to preserve the amenities ofthe port towns if it were possible to put much of the traffic underground in aChannel Tunnel well before it reaches them.Heed to accommodate increasing traffic ,1.9   Britain is no longer economically or socially an island:   our decision to.join the European Economic Community has only emphasised what our patterns oftrade and, indeed, of holiday-making had already made clear.    Traffic to andfrom the Continent will continue to grow.     The basic point we will have todecide is:   can we best provide for it and with the reinforcing by continuing to rely solely on developing existing forms of transport or by supplementingand relieving them with Channel Tunnel?    V7e are not merely examining yet againan old idea;   we are looking for the right answer to a very pressing modernproblem.6A
CHAPTER 2: RECENT HISTORY OF THE PROJECT AT-HD THE DEC IS If MS TO EE TAKENBackground History2.1    The idea of a Channel Tunnel, has been discussed for about 1/0 years.Early plans came to nothing partly because they were ahead of the practicalengineering techniques of their day, and further for fear that foreign armiescould use it to overcome the &quot;moat defensive&quot; of the Channel.2.2   In i960 and 1961, new proposals for fixed crossings of the Channel were put forward by the Channel Tunnel Study Group and the Channel Bridge study group.   A working Group of British and French officials examined theseproposals, and concluded that the tunnel project was feasible from a technical point of view, and was preferable economically either to a bridge or to thecontinued use and development of existing means of transport.   Their report&quot;Proposals for a Fixed Channel Link&quot; (Cmnd 2137) was published in September 19^3-The Minister of Transport, Mr Marples , announced on 6 February 196k that, as aresult of studies jointly undertaken, the British and French Governments had agreed that the construction of a rail Channel Tunnel was technically possible and that in economic terms it would represent a sound investment of the twocountries&apos; resources.   Subject to further discussion of the legal ?no financial problems involved, the two Governments had therefore decided to proceed with the2.3   A major geological and geophysical investigation was undertaken intoconditions on and under the sea bed in the Straits of Dover; this confirmed that a bored tunnel was feasible.   Revised cost and revenue estimates for sucha tunnel were then made by the two Governments wmi.cn suq^uuIvU. uxj.uu, j.n spxuy 0.1increases in the estimated cost, of the Tunnel the investment might shew a betterreturn than had been exnected in 196%
Recent developments2.It   In July 1566 the Eritish and French Prime Ministers (Mr Wilson and h. Pompidou) announced that &quot;subject to finding a solution for the constructionwork on mutually acceptable terms, the two Governments have new taken a decision that the Tunnel should be built&quot;,   In October i960 Eritish and French Ministers(Mrs Castle and M. Pisani) issued a joint statement setting out the position thenreached and confirming the basis on which studies of the relevant problems would proceed; in particular, the Tunnel ?;culd be financed by a Group of privatefinancial interests which would also manage its construction.   The completedTunnel would be handed over to an Anglo-French operating body which would beresponsible for payments of capital and interest to the private Group from theTunnel revenues. -2.5   The then Government sought tenders from interested private groups for the financing ana construction of a tunnel.   Three proposals were submitted, but nonewas acceptable as it steed.   A r.ew combined Group made revised proposals in thelatter part of 1970, and in March 1971 the british  and French Ministers(Mr Peyton and M. Chamant) accepted their proposals.   The Group /listed at Annexare now organised into the british  Channel Tunnel Company and the Societe(the Companies)Franchise du Tunnel sous la Manche/.   The t?;o Governments and the Group agreed ona programme of financial, economic and technical studies which would le ad to adecision whether or not to proceed with the project.2.6   On 20 October I$72 parallel agreements (collectively known as &quot;Agreement Howere concluded between the British and French Goverrments and the members of theGroup,   These provided for the Studies to be cc-pletsd by the middle of 1973 and set out a fr-eaacnork fui- subsuquenc action if the -.r.-,j-.-tt vrent aheacL   Theprovisions of these Agreements are discussed further in Chapter 6 below.   the studies to be completed by mid 1973 sill ucst so-e  5 million shout half of which and?riil fce found by the Ccmnanie-s/ths remainder raised under Government guarantee.
The next stage2.7   The results of the present studies should be available in April.   TheCompanies will then submit their detailed proposals for financing and buildingthe Tunnel.   A decision whether to proceed further could be made in July.   Asecond agreement and an Anglo-French treaty would be required by the end ofJuly /\)V slightly later by agreement/&apos;.   This would provide the main framework for the project as a whole, and detailed provisions for the next pha^e.- Thiswould cover certain initial costs including the sinking of shafts and the trialboring of short lengths of tunnel from either side.   The full facts necessaryto arrive at a decision will be placed before Parliament which would be kept informed at every stage.   A Bill conferring financial powers of the orderof  20m would in any event be required in this Session and would affordParliament a full opportunity not merely to discuss but to decide the fate ofthe project.2.8   The necessary powers for the completion and operation of the tunnel would then be sought by legislation in the next Session of Parliament, takingthe form of a hybrid Bill.   Thereafter a Supplementary Agreement No 3j setting out the final details of the financial arrangements, would be signed (on present plans early in 1975); and - subject only to certain protective provisions for abandonment referred to in para /    / below - the Governments and the companies would at that stage be finally committed to the completion of the project.
CHAPTER 3: THE TUNNELA Pored Rail Tunnel3.1   The proposal undez* consideration is for a bored rail Tunnel between an areajust to the north of Folkestone end Sangatte near Calais.   It ?/ould connect notonly the rail systems of Britain and the Continent, but also their road networks,through the provision of special vehicle ferry trains.3.2   Arguments have been put forward for alternative forms of fixed Channellinks, but neither the British G-overnment nor private interests 7fith thenecessary financial backing have considered any of them worth pursuing in preference to the present project or to the development of the existing means oftransport.   The reasons for this are set out in Annex 2.   The precise combination of factors telling against any particular alternative may vary, but they suffer from the cumulative problems of technical uncertainties, higher cost (withtechnological uncertainties leading to risks of cost escalation), navigationalhazards and the need for international agreement where structures above the sea-bedare involved.   This does not mean that the possibility of another fixed linkmust be ruled out for ever.   But the Government are clear that the presentchoice lies between the construction of a rail tunnel or the continueddevelopment of air and sea services alone.The Tunnel Itself3*3   There would in fact be three tunnels; two main running tunnels each with asingle railway track and a service tunnel between and slightly below thy maintunnels to which it would be connected by crocs-passages called adits every 250 m.Each main tunnel would normally carry trains in one direction only, but theywould be capable of operation in either direction, and would be linked by crossoversout of service, for instance for maintenance.   The service tunnel would provide
easy access for maintenance and inspection and accommodate such services aselectricity, ventilation and drainage, as well as providing a means of evacuation in the event of an accident in one of the main tunnels.   The generallay-out is shown in the diagrams /below/7.3.4   More recent studies of the geology and of the design have shown a shorter line than was originally envisaged to be practicable, with substantial savings in cost as a result.   The line new proposed together with a longitudinalcross-section are shown at ^ &apos;.Engineering and design studies3.5   There is no doubt that a tunnel i3 feasible.   The main areas of engineeringstudy and investigations have been geology, structure and construction, soildisposal, aerodynamics, ventilation, safety, security, rolling stock.aa   GeologyThe studies undertaken in 1964/65 and in the current phase of the project, including a comprehensive borehole and geophysical programme,have confirmed that there is a continuous layer of Lower Chalk across theChannel in such a position that it should be possible to drive the Tunnelat a safe depth keeping within it for almost the whole length.   This material which is ideal for tunnelling is impermeable; there is no evidence of serious fissuring,Structure and tThe main running tunnels would be approximately 7m in diameter, but the precise bisie would depend on roiiing-stock design.   Boring would be carriedout by rotary tunnelling machines, advancing at an average rate of some 3metres per hour.   The main construotion work which would be carried on from both sides of the Channel at once would take about 5 years.,   -ne process of
lining the tunnels which would follow immediately after boring and the design and safety requirements are the subjects of major current studies.If Phase II goes ahead work will start in 1975/74 on the boring of an initiallength of service tunnel as a trial of the boring machines and the methodof lining, with forward probing and instrumentation to check stresses, inadvance of the main works.c. Disposal of spoili.A substantial amount of spoil would be required for levelling withinthe terminal area, but some 2 million cubic metres would have to be disposedof from works on this side of the Channel.   The possibilities of using it forland reclamation or disposing of it at sea are being examined by consulting engineers with the assistance of Local Authorities, hydrological, navigation,environmental and fishery interests.d. Aero-dynamics and VentilationReliance exclusively on electric traction would eliminate the need for fresh air in the vast quantities which would be required to remove exhaustfumes if road vehicles were driven through &quot;the Tunnel.   Present studiesindicate that the necessary ventilation could best be achieved by using the service tunnel as the inlet to distribute fresh air all along the runningtunnels.   Cross-passages between the main tunnels would be needed to offset the &quot;piston effect&quot; and aero-dynamic drag produced by trains moving at speedthrough the great length of the Tunnel, and to permit circulation of air fromthe front to the rear of an advancing train.   The University of Leeds, the st Cyr Laboratories in raris and the iiritisn Railways.research establishment at Derby are assisting in their design.   Special attention is being paid to possible physiological effects on passengers  - travelling through theTunnel.
6.   SafetySafety requirements must be defined and agreed in consultation betweenthe Governments and the Companies.   They cover primarily the safety of passengers, such as ventilation, provision for evacuation, fire fightingsystems.   But they also include aspects of design affecting the tunneland railways, such as clearances, design of railway track and signalling,and the types of locomotive and rolling stock to be used.   The necessarystudies are being carried out.f. SecurityAlthough all possible steps would be taken to minimise interruptions,Tunnel services, like all transport services, could be halted from time totime for insfcanve because of breakdowns or industrial disputes.   this contingency is being examined.   But the Tunnel would have no monopoly and substantial sea and air links between this country and the Continent would always be available.   Methods of preventing unauthorised entry to the tunnelsfor frontier control and security reasons are also being investigated.g. Ferry rolling stockStudies are being made of the dimensions of road vehicles likely to use the Tunnel.   These in turn affect the size of the rolling stock needed tocarry them, and hence the size of the tunnel, a small change in which hasa significant effect on cost.   The design of the v/wagons will also beafffinterl by decisions on the gross and axle weights of vehicles to becarried - hero the negotiations in Brussels are clearly relevant - andthe requirements fcr internal circulation sp::cc   Detailed design work isbeing put in hand, with a view to the construction and testing of proto-typec-,   The type of traction to bo i^-nH jr. s i?.n being strsrUedl3.6   The studies and the refinement of the reference design now in hand -should in the next few weeics be sufficiently advanced to enable both the cost
estimate of the Tunnel to be revised and the detailed specification!? for thePhase II works to be prepared.   Other aspects of the design can, however, be left open for review in the light of progress during Phase II.
CHAPTER 4 - SERVICES THROUGH THE TUNNELTypes oi&apos; Services4.1   The Tunnel would be not merely a connection between the Folkestone andCalais areas, but a key link in the European rail network.   For the first timethe British and Continental railway systems would be directly connected.4.2   There would be two main types of service through the tunnel:(a) vehicle ferry services;(b) normal through rail passenger, &quot;Hotorsil&quot; and freight services(including &quot;Freightliner&quot; type container services) between centres in Britain and the Continent.Both      -3S of train would be hauled by electrical power, based on the 25kV overheadAC sw-     a which is now normal for new electrification schemes on British andFrench railways.   The services as a whole will be operated so as to ensure parity of treatment between potential users of through rail services and the road vehicleferry trains.Ferry services4.3   A frequent shuttle service of drive-on/drive off ferry trains between ferryterminals near Folkestone and Calais ?(&apos;ould provide virtually a &quot;rolling motorway&quot;for road traffic; trains could run every 4 minutes at peak periods.   They would carry cars either in double-deck wagons or in single deckers which could also carrycoaches, caravans and similar vehicles.   Double deck trains could carry some 260cars, or a load comparable to that of one of the existing sea ferry vessels; the single deckers would carry up to 130 vehicles.   Lorries and trailers would becarried separately in single-deck wagons.   Sore of the latter might be open-sidedfrith special enclosed seating areas for the drivers, but ail the other ferry trainswould be fully enclosed.   The drivers could remain in the!:1 vehicles during the 33minute journey, or move about inside the wagons.   Experiments to assess ease of movement inside the ferry trains and the rate as -which passengers could pass throughthe emergency exists, were conducted by the Transport and Road Research Laboratory^,The results are being taken into account in the design studies.*THRL Report LR 43615.
4.4   Road vehicles would be driven on and off the ferry trains by their owndrivers, after passing through customs and immigration within the terminals.Extensive trials of the loading of &quot;mock-up&quot; wagons were undertaken in 1970 and1971 by the Transport and Road Research Laboratory? and the results of thesetrials indicated that it should be possible for incoming vehicles to be unloadedand the train re-loaded for departure in 10 minutes overall.4.5   There would be a frequent and reliable service, which would be neitherI,interrupted .nor made personally uncomfortable by bad weather.   The overall time from entry to one terminal to emerging from the other is expected to be about onehour - faster than by existing sea services.   It is not expected that advancebooking would be required.4.6   The ferry terminals would be at Cheriton, just north of Folkestone, and atSangatte near Calais.   The railway layout at each terminal would be in the form ofa loop so that ferry trains could enter the loading platforms at one end and leave at the other, thereby avoiding conflicting movements and the need for theferry trains to reverse.   They would also provide facilities for customs and immigration control, issuing tickets, refreshments and petrol.   It is not, however,intended to provide in tho Cheriton terminal either for hotel accommodation and similar services (already available in nearby towns and villages) or for warehousinand distribution facilities.   While studies for the- terminal are still in progressa possible design which forms the basis for current studies is sbown in thephotograph at PlateThrough Rail Servicesrus s Mint?. r.s4*7   The Government ana the Board of British Rail are considering the rail networkattractive to travellers who at present use surface or air links to Europe wouldbe essential for fall benefit to be derived from the project.   Put costs of*TRRL Report LR 435
providing them and the revenues they would obtain must be included in the totalevaluation of the tunnel project from tho point of view of the United Kingdominterest,4.3   Tho opportunity of providing a wide range of day services from Britishcities to the nearer Continental centres with journey times competitive withthose for air travel, and night services (including special &quot;charter&quot; type services for holiday-makers) to more distant ones in Germany, Switzerland, Italy is.iclearly one of the attractions of the tunnel proposal.4.9   There are however major problems.   The Southern Region is electrified onthe &quot;third-rail&quot; system, not the 25kV overhead system which would be provided inthe Tunnel and on the links on the Continent.   Vfhile the rail gauge is the same on both sides of the Channel, the loading gauge is not.   Continental stock is too large, for example, to pass under bridges, or between platforms.   There is ashortage of line capacity on the approach routes to London, especially at peakhours.   1,&apos;either the traction supply arrangements nor the actual alignment of manylengths of the existing routes to South East Kent are suited to high-speed running.4=10   A number of options for the improvement of the rail access to London arebeing considered.   The existing boat-train route via Sevenoaks passes throughfour major tunnels and any extensive enlargement to take Continental gauge stockwould be very costly,   An alternative possibility might be to develop the routea^u-p-.-.^    m - v,v^.-; j--^     rv.,4-,, j   -*.;a  o   -t-v. ^  .. .1__     ---3  4.1 ___4--    , j     - -. ......  -sv a.cl jtlo Aix \jx u.,   xuuui. xu^c ^   uAbcu  cuiu. uuuwii oi ujuujt .   emu.   1 11c   uvooo   cuiu. j. cvciiuoo   auou^ia-ted with various schemes for improving it are being examined.   So is the case for providing a new main-line station at Saltwood, near the tunnel portal.   Thisnm 11 n t;owro t^a^fic i^om South-East Kent and ^ossibl&quot; ^rovids some limited decreeof transfer from UK to Continental stock.4.11   Fast and. regular services from London would clearly be a prime attraction;these would require a new Continental terminal.   This should provide adequatecapacity for the traffic expected.   It should be easily accessible to potential
travellers, with good connections for those continuing their journeys withinLondon, or elsewhere.   It should be in an area which could accommodate the traffic and associated developments.   There is no one site which ideally meets all thesecriteria, but three possibilities are under consideration: Victoria, White city and Surrey Docks.   British Rail are assessing the practical problems and costs of development associated with each 3ite, the Greater London Council have undertakenconsultations on their planning implications&apos;&apos;&apos; and the Department of the Environment,in consultation with the Greater London Council, are examining the comparativeaccessibility of the sites (including the cost of any necessary improvements toroads or public transport).b.   Freight services4.12   The Tunnel would for the first time give British Rail an opportunity toprovide freight services over longer distances.   Distances in this country aregenerally too short for the lower trunk haul costs by rail to outweigh the costs of transhipment for collection and delivery.   Continental railways have been ableto take advantage of longer distance.   The Federal German railways carry almost3 times as much freight over 100 miles as do BR, and the SNCF well over 3 times as much.   &quot;Long-haul&quot; freight accounts for only about a fifth of the tonnagecarried on British Rail, but it forms about 2/5 of the total on Federal Germanrailways, and 3/5 of the French total.   The Tunnel would, however&quot;, make possiblethe development of economic through services over substantial distances betweencentres in Britain and the Continent,   The pattern of services would include boththe provision of full train load services and &quot;Freightliner&quot; type container servicesdirect to and from inland ceot.r*es and the road/rail services, using the ferryservices between Cheriton and Sangatte.   With the emphasis on the former,major rail freight facilities would not need to be provided near the Tunnel,though provision might have to be made for a limited amount of train marshalling.*Channel Tunnel London Passenger Terminal; a document for consultation(published by the Greater London Council, November 1572).
Both types of service, by moderating the use of our roads by heavy lorriescarrying Continental freight would make an appreciable contribution to the environment.
CHAPTER 5: ROADS5.1   Whether or not a Channel tunnel is built, major improvements in roadaccess to South East Kent are essential.   In particular, plans for the V.20 routewill be virtually unaffected by the decision.   It is needed to carry much of the increasing traffic to the Continent whether it passes through the Channel portsor goes underground on the Tunnel ferry services from Cheriton.   The line of thisroad from Maidstone to the existing Folkestone by-pass was published in June 1972;i.a public inquiry is expected to be held later this year,5.2   The M20 is planned for completion before the tunnel, and is designed tocater for traffic increases until the end of the century.   It would provide themain road route to the Tunnel (though other routes such as the A2 would also be improved).   It would connect direct to London and via the M25 or the DartfordTunnel to the national motorway and trunk road system,   Moreover, a study of anew Thames crossing which could bypass traffic to the East and North of london was announced on 30 October 1972,5,3   The only additional road work required specifically for the tunnel would bethe actual access roads into the terminal site.   On the other hand, if the tunnelis not built, then in the longer term more extensive road-works would almost certainly be needed particularly in the Dover and Folkestone area because of thedramatic growth of road traffic of all types making for the Channel Forts.
CHAPTER 6: THE EfrVTRONIlENT, AND PLANNING, REGIONAL AND DEFENCE policies the Environment6.1   The construction of a Tunnel in an area of great beauty like South !-!astwould.Kent/inevitably do some damage to the immediate locality.   It must also causeinconvenience during construction.   Over a wider area it should prove helpful bycausing a transfer to rail of what would otherwise be a steadily growing load oftraffic, much of it heavy, penetrating to the Channel Ports themselves.   Eut ifthe Tunnel goes ahead, then measures must and will be taken by sensitive design and careful control of the works to minimise the disruption and inconveniencein the immediate area of the development, in close consultation with the localauthorities and local interests,a.   Site choice6,2   A most important measure has been the careful selection of sites for theprincipal installations.   Cost and geological considerations require the Tunnel to emerge close to the South East Kent coast and after much Investigation of possiblesites for the various installations needed in this area, the choice was narrowedto two groups of site known as the &quot;Sellindge&quot; and the &quot;Cheriton&quot; alternatives.   In1968 in association with the Department of the Environment, Kent County Councilpublished a consultation document? setting out the advantages and disadvantages ofthe alternatives and seeking the views of local authorities, local groups and thegeneral public.   The County Council then considered the alternatives in the lightof representations received and recommended that the Cheriton proposals werepreferable.   In July 1969 the Minister of Transport (Mr Richard Marsh) confirmed that if the Tunnel were built I, be various terminal installations should be in thelocations indicated in that proposal.   The ferry terminal, extending to about 250acres, would be at Cheriton,   Any passenger station would be near Saltwood and anyfreight yard would be at Sevington, on the outskirts of Ashford, or at Staiiford.*The Channel Tunnel - A discussion of terminal requirements on theBritish Side and possible locations for terminal facilities in Kent -Kent County Council, December 1968.
b. Design6.3   The installations would be so designed as to avoid interference with thelocal areas of special scientific interest, and to reduce to a minimum bothvisual intimsion against the panorama of the Downs (a designated area of outstanding natural beauty) and disturbance to the inhabitants of the nearbyvillages.   The Royal Fine Art Commission have been asked to consider the plans for the Tunnel and the ferry Terminal as they become available.   parliament would be asked to approve the construction of the tunnel, the terminal and linklines and railway installation!?; the procedure would enable objectors to petitionParliament and have their case considered by it.   This would be supplemented bythe closest consultation with the planning authorities, who retain control overthe detailed design of any buildings erected.c. Noise6.if   Particular attention is being paid to the problem of disturbance by noise.Existing ambient noise levels have already been recorded in the areas earmarked for j)possible terminal facilities and when terminal designs have been developedlevels ofin sufficient detail further studies will be undertaken to predict the/noiseduring the operating period.   On the basis of these studies it should be possibleto foresee any serious problems which might arise and to determine what furtherprotective measures should be taken.d. Compensation6.5   But whatever the overall balance of benefit, some individuals might wellbe adversely affected.   For those who despite all reasonable protective measuresdo suffer, the Land Compensation Bill at present before Parliament would offermore generous compensation terms that were available in the past, both where land has to be taken for the &quot;works and where residents suffer &quot;injurious affection&quot;arising from Tunnel operations.   Such of the Bill1s provisions as those relatingto sound proofing - during the construction and operating phases - to rehousing, to residential business and agricultural interests, and to blight would apply.
In addition the Department of the Environment has for some time had powers toacquire property by agreement where the ov/ner is suffering hardship because hehas been genuinely unable to dispose of it at a reasonable figure because it islikely to be required for Tunnel purposes, and a number of properties have alreadybeen acquired on that basis.Economic and Social implications for South East Kent6.6   The Government, the local authorities and local interests will wish, to judge the effects of the Tunnel, direct and indirect, on employment, population anddevelopment in South East Kent.   Clearly the interaction between shipping and portemployment and tunnel employment will be an important consideration, as will thepossibility of commercial development attracted by the Tunnel,6.7   In order to enable all concerned to assess these problems the Departmentof the Environment, in co-operation with Kent County Council and the borough councils of Dover and Folkestone, appointed Economic Consultants Ltd to undertake a study of the social and economic effects of the Tunnel project on Folkestone andDover and their hinterland, and any major impact elsewhere in Kent.   This studywhich should be available in the spring, will be published.Regional policy.8   There are natural misgivings that construction of the tunnel might increasethe pressures for development of South-East England, and adversely affect theprospects of other Regions.   There may indeed be some increase in the pull ofSouth-East Kent, the strength of which it will be easier to assess in the light ofthe study referred to in the preceding paragraph.   But there will be factorsnarking in the ouuosite dix-uulion.   In particular, the provision of directfreight and passenger rail services from regional centres to the Continent wouldgive t-he Regions greater accessibility to their markets.
6.9   The Government have undertaken a review of the implications of the project for regional policy.   This cannot be completed until the traffic forecasts referredto in paras /      J below are available.   Even then it may not be possiblecompletely to isolate and quantify the effects of a Tunnel on particular parts ofthe United Kingdom, though all would share in the overall benefits.   The Governmentwould continue under its regional policies to foster development in the assisted areas and would consider with the Kent County Council what development policieswould be appropriate in South Hast Kent.Defence policy.10.   While a Tunnel would have certain implications for military movements, nodefence risks are foreseen which could outweigh even the direct advantages of theTunnel to the Services.

CHAPTER 7: ORGANISATION AND FINANCE7.1   The proposed arrangements for organising and financing the construction and operation of a Channel Tunnel which have been developed by successive administrationover the past decade involve an unusual partnership between the British and french governments, and between Government and private interests.Construction,a.   General7.2   As explained in Chapter 2 above, the raising of finance fcr the Tunnel and itsconstruction would be undertaken by an international group (listed in Annex l),organised into the British Channel Tunnel Company Ltd (the British Company)and the Societe*   Franchise du Tunnel sous la Kanche (the French Company).Parallel Agreements were concluded on 20 October 1972 between the British andFrench Governments respectively and the Companies and their constituent undertakingsThese regulate Phase I of the project, which covers the period during which thefinal studies are heirs carried out.   They also include outline arrangements for the subsequent stages of construction (phases II and III) and for the remuneration of thprivate capital when the tunnel is in operation.   These latter provisions are, ofcourse, contingent on the continuation of the project; the later phases would be governed by further Agreements (Nos 2 and 3), but there is as yet no obligationupon any of the parties zo continue beyond Phasel(see paragraph 7.6 below).7,3   these I will have cost about  5.4 million.   Phase II, which is due to begin atthe end of July 1973 and to extend to February 1975? has been estimated to cost abcuP.20 million and. would include the sinking cf shafts and the trial boring of some twokilometres of service tunnel from each side of the Channel.   This Phase would begin with the signature of Agreement No 2, which would be accompanied by anAngio-Erench Treaty,   phase III would run from February 1975 to 1980 whenconstruction would be complete.   Thereafter the first 50 years of operation would constitute the re.nunor.ition period - see below *4
7,4   About half the cost of Phase I, between 10$ and 30$ of the cost of Phase and a minimum of 10% of the total forecast cost would come from private riskinvestment , which would be remunerated only out of profits and would not attracta Government guarantee.   The balance of funds required, including those needed tomeet any possible over-run beyond the forecast cost which was not otherwise met,would be raised by the Companies in the form of loans guaranteed by the Governments.The Government guaranteed capital would be paid off within 25 years of the&apos;openingof the Tunnel.7.5   Shares issued by the Companies would attract payment throughout the remuneration period out of profits (after payments on fixed interest capital)based on a formula depending partly on gross receipts and partly on net receipts.The balance of profits after taxation would be available to the Governments.Holders of shares or other non-guaranteed securities issued in Phases I and IIwould, because of the special nature and risk of these investments, be entitledto receive additional shares or securities during Fhase III.7.6   The project can be abandoned at any time by any party, and detailed provisions are set out in the Agreements.   If at the end of Phase I the parties agreed that itwas not worthwhile, or if the Companies themselves decided to withdraw, then theprivate risk money subscribed to date would in effect be lost and the governments would have to meet their guarantees; the cost to the British Government might be ofthe order of  1.5m.   If, however, Agreement No 2 cannot be signed because of failure to agree on certain matters still to be negotiated but on which proposals by the Companies not in contradiction with Agreement No I are neverthelessuiiacceDcable to the Governments. the latter wonln  near- a h-\*har* tirmwr.inri of the costs.   If the Governments decided to abandon when the Companies wished to proceed,maximum liability of HMG would be between  4m and  5m.
7.7   If the project were abandoned at a later stage, the saae broad principleswould apply as between the Coaipanies and the Governments.   If, for instance,unexpected difficulties were encountered in construction which would so increasecosts as to make the project no longer worthwhile, then the risk money alreadyexpended would be lost, and the Governments would have to meet their guarantees,If the Companies decided to withdraw, or if they were unable to raise the necessaryrisk money, the same would apply, unless the Governments chose to proceed with the project without private participation, in which case certain &quot;buy back&quot; provisions would operate.   If the Governments chose to abandon the project when the Companieswished to proceed, they would have not only to   honour the guarantees, but also topurchase the Companies&apos; interests at a price in excess of their cost and calculated on a basis set out in the Agreements.7.3   The Governments would share equally the costs of any abandonment in Phase I;the arrangements for sharing the cost of any later abandonment will be fixed by treaty.7.9   During the remuneration period the Governments may if they so wish terminate the agreement and buy out the Companies&apos; interest on a predetermined basisdepending on such matters as the market value of their shares and the pastdividend record.7.10   Other key financial questions which remain to be settled include the preciseformulae on which the private risk capital would be remunerated and the terms tobe offered for the guaranteed funds.   These can only be settled in the light ofthe outcome of the economic and financial studies and eventually of the marketuuuuitiuna  til the  time when  the funds have to be raisfiri-    The terms will have tobe such that the necessary funds can be raised, but the Governments (who will beentitled to the balance of profits hot required to remunerate the private capital.)will also be concerned to obtain an adequate share of the Tunnel profits.
c.   Organisation7,11   The Eritish and French Companies are responsible for the conduct of the studies and, if it is decided to proceed with the project, for the constructionof the tunnel, subject to the supervision by the Governments jointly of certain matters, including general progress, the definition of what is to be built and safety.   Each of the companies has project managers (in this country,Rio Tinto Zinc Development Enterprises Ltd) to manage the project on their- behalf.Operation7.12   On completion the Tunnel would be handed over by the Companies to theGovernments.   The latter in turn would hand it over to an operating authority which would be established by Treaty.   The terms of reference of this authority would be to manage the Tunnel as a commercial enterprise in competition with othermean3 of cross-Channel transport with a view to securing the best possible earningson capital employed in the enterprise, without discrimination between road and railborne traffic.   This would not preclude normal commercial practices, includingthe adoption of tariff differentials for particular goods and services and forpeak and off-peak periods, and policies designed to make the Tunnel competitivev/ith other means of crossing the Channel.   The operating authority would beresponsible for remunerating the private capital over 50 years in accordance withthe formulae to be agreed and for disposing of the residual profits as directed by the Governments.   After 50 years, all the profxts would be available to theGovernments.   The members of the authority would be appointed by the British andFrench Ministers, but provision would be made for minority representation of theKnninflnlRR   n11 r&quot;^ncr tna   ruan^vrio v*a-TT.r\r^   non^on^   fno   2.rtTro&quot;    dQnOrldinr*  OU  the   amOUnt   Ofprivate risk capital subscribed.   The Companies would also have an effective say we tariff policy within its commercial terms of reference,   certain powers of direction over the operating authority would be reserved to the two Governmentsacting jointly.
7.13   Detailed proposals regarding the establishment, 3tatus and functioning of the operating authority are under discussion with the French Government.The aim is to establish an effective and unified executive authority.   Among thepoints to be considered are the precise structure of the authority, its legalstatus and the extent to which the juridical regime applying to it might have tobe separately defined, the application of fiscal and exchange control regimes;and the provision to be made for the users&apos; interests to be represented on.it.7.14  &quot;while the Tunnel would not be handed over to the authority until completionthere would be a large number of matters affecting operation to be settled inadvance.   It would, for example, be necessary for the terms to be determined onwhich the railway administrations might provide certain services for the authority and, conversely, the tolls to be charged to the railways for the passage ofthrough trains.   Other tariffs and train schedules would have to be settled wellin advance of the opening.   It is, moreover, desirable that the conditions ofservice for Tunnel staff should be settled at an early date.   Under Agreement No 1it is envisaged that the operating authority should be set up at latest byFebruary 1979*   In view of the problems mentioned, the Governments are examining the precise timing of its establishment, ^and the possibility of having someprecursor body^.7.15   The operating authority would work closely with British Railways and the SNCWhile both are represented in the TunnelICompanies j*.it is not expected that theywould be directly represented on the operating authority.   The closest liaisonwould, however, have to be&apos; maintained over the operation of the Tunnel and the through rail services-   The success of the Tunnel prcioct and the contributionit would make to the railways would depend partly on the success of their jointmarketing of the possibilities of through rail transport for passengers and freight.   Where services were supplied by the Tunnel to the Railways or vice-versathis would be done on a commercial basis.
CHAPTER 8: CURRENT STUDIES8,1   A number of specific studies which are being undertaken of particularaspects of the Tunnel project have already been referred to.   These are essentialto the decision whether it should go ahead or not, and to implementation of the project if it does.   The decision, however, will be primarily dependent on the outcome of current studies both of the financial viability of the project and of iteconomic costs and benefits to this country.i.Previous studies8.2   There have been a number of previous studies undertaken by the Eritishand French Governments.   The joint study undertaken in 1J62 and I963 by a working group of Eritish and French officials has already been referred to (para 2.2 above)This was updated by an Anglo-French Working Group in 1966, taking account where possible of the latest trends but without any new data collection or forecasting,and in 19^9 the French Government commissioned a new study of the project.   Theseindicated that further work oii the project would be justified.   Neither the1966 nor the 19&amp;9 exercise was published.Current joint studies(a)   General8.3   In March 1971 the British and French Governments agreed with the internationalGroup referred to in para     above, the basis on which the final studies of the project would be pursued.   The programme for these studies covers the period upto mid-1973&apos;   While the studies form a continuous whole, certain interim results from the oreliminary oilot work became available in the Spring of 1972. whichnolpod the Cem&quot;aniec and Cevornmcnts to cere&quot;&apos; u^0 t&apos;ha&quot;*&quot; t*^Q ^tr^cnontr we*Y*a suff^^^ pnf.ly promising to justify the completion of the studies.   This decision was announced on lb August 1972, and the detailed arrangements are set out in Agreement No 1(see para 7-2 above).
(b)   Organisation and Scope of Studies8.4  The studies are being undertaken by the project managements on behalfof the Companies and with the approval of the Ministers.   The project managers in turn have arranged for certain of the studies to be undertaken by specialistconsult ants.i.   Technical8.5   The scope and nature of the technical studies including design v;ork, have1.already been referred to in Chapter 3*   They will result in the preparation of a reference design for the Tunnel with its associated terminal installations andequipment.   While this will be subject to yet further refinement as the projectproceeds, it will provide the basis for assessing the forecast capital costs bothof the phase II works and of the Tunnel up to handover on completion (including all necessary initial equipment and ferry rolling stock).   The preliminary estimate forthis was  366m in constant prices (January 1972 prices and exchange rates, withoutinterest) made up as follows:Estimated capital cost (1972prices a.Tunnels and railway equipment 202Terminals 58&quot;Rolling Stock 53Project development and miscellaneous expenses 12Project Management, engineering and construction 28supervisionContingencies7 2jjTotal 366These figures are currently being revised in relation to the progress withthe tunnel reference design and up-dated to a 1975 cost base.
ii.   Economic Studiesa. General8.6   The aim of the joint economic studies is to forecast (on realisticassumptions as to the tolls to be charged) the traffic likely to use theTunnel, the revenue which would accrue and the overall profitability ofthe undertaking on particular assumptions as to the methods of finance,8.7   The project managers have arranged for these studies to be undertaken by specialist consultants (Cooper Brothers and Co Ltd in Britain and SSTEC-Economicin France) under parallel contract arrangements.   The two consultants are working closely together under arrangements agreed with the Companies and governments.b. Traffic forecasting8.8   The traffic forecasts are being built up on the basis of:- extensive survey work on existing air and surface traffic, bothpassenger and freight.- studies of costs, charges and the likely competitive situation which a tunnel would face; and- mathematical models designed to forecast as realistically as possible,in the light of their results the likely volume of traffic which would be diverted to, cr generated by the existence of, a Tunnel.Separate forecasts are being made for different types of traffic, and differentmodels are being developed to present as closely as possible the characteristics of th.8 foHewing main categoric s into v?hich. the traffic has been divided.;- Continental leisure traffic- Business traffic- Other passenger traffic (referred to as &quot;non-European&quot; traffic).- Freight traffic.
8.9   Details of the surveys, and of the basic structure of the models concerned are set out in Annex 3*8.10   All the traffic forecasting work will depend on certain key assumptions.In some cases it will be necessary to use alternative ones.   More generally, thesensitivity of the results to variations in them will be tested.8.11   The preliminary results of the current studies suggested that, on a variety of assumptions, in 1980 between 4.3 and 5*8 million journeys might be made throughthe Tunnel by passengers using through services, that 1.2m-2.1m cars (with some3.3m to 5.9ni passengers) might be carried on the train ferry services, and between  and 8 million tons of freight might use it.   The cux*rent studies should enablethese broad ranges to be substantially narrowed,c.   Revenue forecasting8.12   On the basis of the study of the likely competitive conditions, the levels of tolls which would maximise the Tunnel revenues in various competitive situationsare being examined.   In the light of this, the gross and net revenue which mightaccrue on a limited range of assumptions as to the general level of tolls charged by competing operators will be calculated.8.13 The preliminary work suggested that on certain assumptions as to the generalgrowth of traffic and toll levels the revenue in 1980 and 1990 might be as follows:P.m (1972 nrices)1^9022-2842-533.5-4.593,5-120,5Again, the current studies should enable those rangcS to be narrowed.passengersCay +1&quot;^a+&apos;,^P-^ r\Misc;el19 o015-1723-28ii    no2-3
d.   Profitability analysis8.14   The forecasts of revenue, capital and operating costs will make it possibleto assess the overall financial viability of the project and the extent to whichnet profits would be available to remunerate private risk capital and theGovernments.8.15   This assessment will include an analysis of the risk factors, ana of thesensitivity to them of the financial return on the project.8.16   On the basis of the preliminary work the Companies concluded, and reportedto Ministers, that &quot;even on the most conservative assumptions regarding economic development and commercial policy, the financial profitability of the Tunnel is satisfactory in the sense that it is at least equal to that of other similarprojects and significantly above prevailing interest rates&quot;.Other studies8.17   Y,&apos;hile the joint studies should provide the answer to the question&quot;will a Tunnel pay?&quot;, this is not necessarily the full answer to the question&quot;would construction of a Tunnel be better for the UK than continued reliance ondeveloping existing forms of cross-Channel transport?&quot;.   There are a number ofother important factors which need to be assessed before an informed decision canbe taken as to the advantages of a tunnel to the United Kingdom.   These are the concern of the Government rather than the Companies and HWG have therefore putin hand a number of additional studies of matters directly affecting the interestsof the United Kingdom.   These include:a.   A study of the economic cost and benefits to the UK of continuingt.c Tfiiy nn existing modes of cross-Chamit:! traffic or supplementing themwith a Tunnel.   This will be undertaken under contract by Cooper Brothers and go Ltd, find will bo designed to answer both the Questions &quot;Would, it becheaper?&quot; and &quot;Would it be a better buy?&quot;.   This study will consider the implications for transport costs and benefits as a whole, talcing account of
possible developments in transport technology and improvements in competingmodes, but will not cover certain aspects v/ith important policy implications whichare not susceptible to comparable numerical analysis.b. The studies of certain environmental, local economic and social, and regionalimplications of the project referred to in Chapter 5 above.c. The studies of road and rail connections referred to in Chapter 4.d. A broad assessment of the possible implications of the &quot;with Tunnel&quot;-and &quot;with-out Tunnel&quot; alternatives for the balance of payments.8.18  One aspect: of the proposal to which particular attention has been and is being paid is any pssible interaction with the Maplin Airport project.   As explained in para/l.t/ above, the traffic which may be diverted from air to the Tunnel will have little impact on the total demand for air travel, though it will be a substantialelement in the through rail traffic using the Tunnel.   In addition the implications of the two projects for available rosources, and in particular for the construction industry, are being kept under review, though no serious problems are anticipated.The combined demands of the Maplin project, major urban renewal in the LondonDocklands area and the Channel Tunnel would represent only of the total national labour force employed by contractors or 6fa of that in the South East. Moreover,investment in the Tunnel would be an alternative to other forms of investment incross-Channel facilities which would themselves make large demands on our resources.While the current studies will all contribute to the decision whether or not toproceed with the project, there will be further technical and economic studies duringPhase II, if it proceeds, aimed at refining the design and providing a firmer basis fortho final arraneeruents fov- raising thM m^i.ln capitals
CHAPTER 9: conclusion.1   The present studies (the main results of which will be published before anyfurther commitment is entered into) will be completed by the early summer.   TheTunnel Companies will thereafter submit their proposals for financing constructionto the Government.9.2 A decision whether or not to proceed further should be possible in mid-suamerParliaments approval of such a decision would then be sought together with limitefinancial powers to cover certain initial visrks. ,9.3   In the event of a decision to proceed a further agreement between theGovernments and the Companies and an Anglo-French Treaty would be required by31 July, though it might be possible for this to be slightly postponed.9.4   Between autumn 1973 and early 1975 certain initial works, including trialborings, would be undertaken.   At the same time the larger powers required forthe project would be sought from Parliament.9-5   A supplementary agreement setting out the final details of the financial arrangements would be signed in 1975*   The main finance would then be raised andthe major construction be undertaken.   The Tunnel should be opened in 1980.9.6   Consultations are already under way directly with many interested bodies,including the local authorities most concerned.   A Consultative Panel has beenestablished on which many such interests are represented.   This process willcontinue.9.7   The purpose of this paper is to bring together all the facts andconsiderations currently available and relevant, and to explain to the public the steps being taken to ensure that the eventual decision is soundly based.The Government would welcome an informed consideration of the prujecL by all whohave an interest in it.   A decision whether or not to proceed with the ChannelTunnel is for this country an historic one;   The Government wish the decision to btaken in the light of the fullest possible discussion.

annex 2^&apos;&apos;oy co^irai-bvriors applying to alterative pc:;&quot;:; c? fixed linkRead/Rail Bridgea. ^Vnhrm cnl Feasibility    Bridge techniques have advanced, since theproposals of the Channel Tunnel Bridge Group were considered in 1962/63,it has been argued that a bridge should now be a feasible propositionand one which would be more acceptable to users than a Tunnel,   Butdistances, water depth, shipping congestion and weather conditions inthe Channel - which might hamper both construction and use - indicatedifficulties much greater than those with which any bridge built&apos; hithertohas had to contend.   Major projects at the limit of &quot;the state of the art&quot;carry exceptional risks of cost escalation.b. Cost    a bridge, on the estimates of the various promoters themselves,would cost about twice as much as a bored rail tunnel.   It has beenargued that it would attract sufficient traffic willing to pay sufficientlyhigh tolls so that it would be an economic proposition.   This is very doubtful, -   Rough testing in the light of tentative preliminary dataemerging from the first year of the current tunnel studios suggest that even on the most favourable hypotheses the economic and financial returnwould be inadequate.   It is proposed to do more work on this aspect whenthe final results of the current studies are available.   So far howeverthere is no reason to disagree with the White paper1s conclusion that,except on a &quot;very high&quot; traffic assumption, a bridge would be less satisfactory in economic terms than continued reliance on established means.c. Navigation Implications    The 1963 White Paper said that a bridge would constitute a navigational hazards   It is now claimed that a bridge wouldin faot improve marine safety because of the sophisticated equipment whichcould be mounted on it and because of the lane discipline that it wouldenforce.   The Department of Trade and Industry have recently reviewed these arguments and have concluded that during both the construction and operatingperiods a bridge would constitute a hazard (see also para. 6 below),d. Intornational Implications     The white Paper suggested that construction ofa bridge would require international agreement.   This view remains valid,International law would require the prior approval of the States principally concerned with navigation in the Channel,   This would bo a major task and early agreement could not be assured.   Due account would have to be taken of the traffic separation scheme sponsored by the Intergovernmental .Maritime Consultative Organisation,0.   Environmental Implications     To achieve viability a road bridge - or a roadbridge/tunnel/bridge - would have to attract and generate much more trafficthan the rail tunnel; while it scorns unlikely that sufficient would be&apos;    ; - Mu !
attracted, any addition would bo funnelled into South East Kent,   moreover,through-road facilities would act as an incentive for yet more freight to bodiverted from the railways to the roads,o   Hoad/rail bridge/tunnel/bridgea. This bridge variant has the aira of reducing the navigational hazard bygoing into tunnel below the main shipping lanes.   As presented, it would cost more than a straightforward bridge, largely because of the problems ofgradients between the elevated bridge and the submarine tunnel.   Evenaccepting its reduced navigational hazards it would still encounter moot ofthe other problems that a Bridge would raise, plus some of those inherent in an immersed tube (see paras 3 and 6 below).b. A proposal has also been put forward for a concrete bridge/tunnel/bridge,which, because of gradient problems would carry only road traffic.   The costs are stated to be. 171 million at 1963 prices but there is a possibility thatthis is a substantial underestimate^costs would be much more if provisionshad to be added for rail traffic.&apos;3,  loaersed Rail Tubea*   Technical Feasibility    Despite the success, of the Hong Kong Tunnel&apos; recentlycompleted on the immersed tube principle the complications cited in para1.a above make this a doubtful proposition.   There might also be difficulties over excavating the channel into which the tube sections wouldbe placed and in keeping it clear for the necessary period]moro research onbottom drift might well be needed.   It would also be necessary to lift andreplace marine cables etc.b.. -Cost   Ho detailed costing has been done but. the technical uncertainties could lead to substantial escalation,c. Havication Imnlications   It is likely that there would be a substantialmarine hazard during the construction period and any permanent projectionabove the sea bed (or even scouring of the fill above it) might cause&apos; shifting of existing banks in the Channel.d. International Implications   It is possible that the agreement of the maincountries whose ships use the channel would be necessary in view of theobstruction and possible delay to ships that would, be caused in theconstruction psri od -4. Road Tunnel or Road Immersed TubeUntil an internal combustion engine can be built which emits much less fumes a roadtunnel or immersed tube is ruled out because of yentilnfcjon prohloma-   *Fnn onlysolution available at the present time is a series of ventilation shafts dotted acrossthe Channel, which would be both dangerous and expensive.   Both projects were considered and rejected as inferior to the bored rail tunnel by the Channel TunnelStudy Croup in 1950; technology ha3 not materially improved their prospects in the interval.5*. Bridge and Euro City SchemeOver the past tv/o years some publicity has attended a scheme for creating a Euro-city
ar.d port complex on the Varne and Lo Colbert Banks; the city world be linked bv Vrizo Britain and Prance.   The scheme has not boon coctcd but a figure for the bridreelement varying between  750 million and  1,000 million has been quoted.Supporters of bridge/tunnel/bridgc alternatives cite the Chesapeapeako Bay structuresupport of their proposals.   In fact it serves as a warning both against ouch propo;and against all bridge proposals,   &quot;he Bridge has been out of commission on several occasions since it was opened in 19^4 because of damage by ships.   The most modemequipment inthe world, including radar, was unable to prevent these collisions.   an accident in September 1972 caused tremendous dislocation to the surrounding transno:system and press reports at the time estimated that 8*25,000 a day would be lost in revenue.   The bonds issued to finance the project, already depressed in price because:they were about 2 years in arrears on interest payment, fell further to half their -value.   It is interesting to note that in September 1969 the engineer responsible fcthe design of the Chesapeake Bay structure told the Institution of Civil EngineersLondon that in his opinion the bored rail Tunnel was the best form of fixed cross -Channel link.&apos;1&apos;&apos;* mTimoa,     30 September I969.
ANNEX 3JOINT ECONOMIC STUDIESSummary of coverage and methodologyPassenger Surveys(a) Individual holiday maker surveyThis survey is designed to provide information on the relationship between foreign holiday making patterns and a number of socio economiccharacteristics, such as age, income, family size, car ownership andso forth.     It is based on an initial contact of 6600 individuals,resulting in a final usable sample of 4500.(b) Short holiday maker surveyThis survey is similar in purpose to (a) but relates to shortholidays (defined as less than 6 nights).     19000 persons have beencontacted and full interviews conducted with people who have taken ashort foreign holiday.     About 10Q short holiday interviews resulted from the survey and another 400 were found in (a) above.     18600 nonshort holiday makers were found of which 9300 were interviewed.(c) Denth SurveysTwo surveys have been conducted the first among &apos;non abroad&apos;holiday makers.     This is to determine the reasons why people choosenot to take foreign holidays and will act as a check on the forecastgrowth rates and market saturation forecasts arising out of the mainmodels.     200 individuals have V     interviewed.     The other surveyconcerns reactions to the tunnel;   about 120 individuals have beeninterviewed in depth to gauge reactions to tunnel travel.origin ana w;^aj.nc.uj.vu gurvey ij.dij.cxyThis survey is de-signed to discover the ultimate origins andripstinati orin nf British        r^vi brxtish travellers.     It covers bothair and sea and provides the base data necessary for the calibrationof the diversion models.     The sample size was 3&apos;000.(e)     Car holiday maker surveyThis was a postal nuGstionnaire survey designed to throw lighton car holidaymaking habits and the likely trend in car holiday makingin the future.     57^0 persons were surveyed and 3300 replies were obtained.
/THE FORECASTING MODEL(a) Export SurveyThis survey is designed to establish the origin, destination androutes of &quot;tunnellable1 exports in 1970.   It covered the main commoditieslikely to be attracted to the tunnel.(b) Import SurveyThis covers the same commodities as (a) and for the same purpose.Additionally it provides information on the reasons for the choice ofmode and route.Costs and Charges Survey (Passenger &amp; Freight)This survey, which covers air, sea, rail and road transport is intendedto establish the cost structure of existing operations with a view bo obtainingforecasts of these costs in the future.   This information is essential in orderto determine the competitive position in 1980,THE COMPETITION MODELThe volume of traffic likely to use a tunnel cannot be forecast in isolation: the reaction of competing operators to the introduction ofa tunnel must be taken into account.   Accordingly a competition model isbeing constructed which will be integrated with the traffic forecastingmodels described below, in order to simulate the likel2/- competitive situationin 1980,   The reactions of operators will be examined on the basis of alternative assumptions as to tolls, traffic levels, sailing times, capacity and no forth in order- to determine the balance of traffic between the tunneland other operators under plausible competitive situations.
IjffJIHCASTING M0DSLSBritish leisure traffic on the basis of the origin and destination data and the results of the individualholiday maker survey British leisure traffic is to be forecast on the basis of a multistage model.- to predict total demand for holidays abroad.   This prediction will be based onsuch factors as income, family size and so forth.- to allocate this demand to various countries, based on changes in the relativecost of tourism, fares, etc.- to allocate non car holiday makers to(a) independent holidays   (b) package holidays- to allocate the holidays forecast in the previous stages to various routes and modeof transport.   The tunnel is one route/mode combination.   The allocation by route and mode is based on such factors as total end to end journey distance, cost, timeof crossing etc.This model is designed to forecast main holidays: suitably adapted it-will be used in theforecasting of short holidays.
