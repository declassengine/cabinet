/&quot;brafi White PaperJ7Private Practice in National Health Service HospitalsIntroduction1.     In March 1972 the House of Commons Expenditure Committee issued a report on National Health Services Facilities for Private Patients,This report arose from enquiries made and evidence collected at hearingsheld by its Employment and Social Services Sub-Committee over the period from 19 May to 26 October 1971; it thus took into account facts and viewspresented by individuals and organisations directly and indirectlyinterested in private practice.   These included Health Service authorities;the largest of the provident associations concerned with hospital services for private patients; bodies representing the medical and nursingprofessions; they also included some who declared themselves opposed tothe principle of private practice within the framework of the National health service (BHS).2.     The Expenditure Committee1 s Report, together with the evidencepublished with it, therefore forms a collection of comment and opiniontogether with some detailed information on the subject of private practice in NHS hospitals.   The Government has studied it as a contribution to discussion of a subject on which there are differing views and which has aroused controversy both on matters of principle and on the practical application of the existing arrangements.3.     There have also been direct discussions, originating before theHouse of Commons Expenditure Committee began its enquiry, between theJoint Consultants Committee* and the Secretary of State for Social Services*The JCC consists of representatives of the follovring bodies:-Royal College of Physicians, Royal College of Surgeons, Royal College ofObstetricians &amp; Gynaecologists, Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh,Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, Royal College of Physicians andSurgeons of Glasgow, Royal College of Psychiatrists, Faculty of Anaesthetists,Royal College of Pathologists, Faculty of Radiologists, Central Committee for hospital Dental Services of the British Dental Association, Central Committeefor Hospital Medical Services of the British Medical Associationtogether with an observer from Northern Ireland.
about the Government&apos;s attitude to private practice and to a number of specific matters which concern the profession.   The Government&apos;s viewson these matters, covering also the Health Service in Scotland and Yales,were sought; and it was agreed that after due consideration the views ofthe Government should be incorporated in a public statement.4.     The purpose of the present   /hite Paper is twofold.    It records theGovernment&apos;s response to the recommendations in the Expenditure committee report and comments on some of the evidence and discussions publishedwith the report.   At the same time this response and these comments are put in the context of the Government1s general views on private practice and on the matters under discussion with the medical profession.Private Practice in Great Britain5.     The creation of the NHS in 1948 brought with it the incorporation in the newly created State Service of much, indeed most, of the then existing private practice of medicine.   The great majority of specialiststook up part or full-time posts in the new hospital service.   Similarly,most general practitioners accepted contracts with the new executive councils for the provision of general medical services.   Some doctorsremained entirely outside the service,   but what is more important forthe discussions with which this White Paper is concerned, all general practitioners and part-time hospital specialists within the Service alsoretained the right to provide medical care for private patients.6.    So far as general practitioners are concerned, their link with theiJHS is a contract for services.   They have an unqualified right torender such services also to private patients.   If they do, this is amatter entirely outside the scope of the MS.   But for hospital doctors and dentists the case is different.   In setting up the NHS hospital service,provision was made within the new service   for beds for private patients.
These beds were to be available on full repayment of the cost of the accommodation and services provided.Private Practice in IIHS Hospitals7.     Last year&apos;s White Paper on NHS Reorganisation: England (Cmnd 5055)restated the Government&apos;s present view of the arrangements for private  ,specialist practice first enacted by the Government of that day in 1946and endorsed by all Governments since then.   The Government recognises the contribution made by the private sector of medicine to the sum ofhealth care, and thinks it right for people to have an opportunity toexercise a personal choice to seek treatment privately.8.     At the same time it is apparent from some of the evidence submittedto the Sub-Committee that there is a body of opinion which holds thatthe present system produces adverse consequences for the NHS as well asaffording opportunities for misuse of NHS facilities in favour ofthe private sector and to the detriment of NHS patients.     Some criticsthereforeurge that private practice should/be wholly separate from the NHS.   these views are discussed in some detail in the Report.   After considering allthe evidence   presented to them the Committee came to the conclusion that private practice operates to the overall benefit of the NHS.9.     The Government agrees with this finding; and welcomes the recommendationsof the Committee that no major changes in the system are required.   In theGovernment&apos;s view there is a balance of advantage in favour of thepresent arrangements for the provision of some facilities for private patients alongside those for NHS patients.The Effect of Private Practice10.   The provision of facilities for private practice enables patientseligible for NHS treatment,but who prefer to make private arrangements with a consultant, to use (at full cost) the comprehensive facilities ofNHS hospital services.   They also provide the opportunity to treat
private patients from overseas and those from this country who might otherwise seek treatment abroad.   In this way a stimulus is providedfor practitioners in this country to maintain and enhance our positionas an international medical centre of excellence, to the generalbenefit of the people in this country.11.   Part-time consultants able to have their own private patients in the same hospital as their NHS patients, with the consequent saving of travelling time, can devote more of their time to both classes of patients and deal more easily with emergencies than if private practicewere wholly separate.      Also, private facilities in NHS hospitals canbe subject to overall planning as an integrated part of total health care.Single rooms or accommodation in small wards -which might be used for private patients can also be made available for NHS patients whose conditionmakes it appropriate.12.   These benefits would be lost if no provision were made for private practice in NHS hospitals.    There would then be a danger that thedemand for private treatment outside NHS hospitals would draw scarceprofessional skills away from the NHS; and in many cases these skills wouldbe of a particularly high order.   A complete divorce of public and private practice would create separate medical services for the public and private sectors in a way which would be detrimental to the NHS.Comparison of NHS and pay bed facilities13.   As things are at present the private patients in NHS hospitalsreceive the same medical care as NHS patients.   The private patient   hasthe right to the personal services of the consultant of his choice andmay well have more of his time than a NHS patient.   But this does not amount to different medical care since the same consultants are chargedwith and accept full clinical responsibility for private and NHS patients.14.   A private patient will normally expect and receive privacy of accommodation.   This is an advantage which is at present available only to
CONFIDENTIALa limited but growing number of NHS patients.   Privacy is provided for those who need it on medical grounds.   In some hospitals a patient mayobtain an !amenity&apos; bed (ie a bed in single room or small ward) on payment* without becoming a private patient provided the accommodation isnot for the time being needed by another patient on medical grounds.   Thisstill leaves in older hospitals a fairly considerable gap in privacybetween the NHS and the private patient.   But in  new hospital building thenumber of single rooms and the arrangement of the other beds in a ward in small groups provide NHS patients with opportunities for a higher degreeof privacy than before.   In this and other ways, such as the liberalisingof visiting hours and the choice of menus, the standards of amenity forNHS patients are coming nearer to those enjoyed by private patientsf andin such matters it may be one of the benefits of private practice that it setsstandards which provide a pattern for the NHS as a whole to follow.15.   The most obvious benefit to the private patient, apart from the ability to choose his own specialist, is that in non-urgent cases hehas the advantage of choosing the time of his admission.   This is areasonable benefit to confer on the patient with a non-urgent conditionwho chooses to devote his own resources to the purchase of medical orsurgical services.   But this planned admission is not and must not beachieved at the expense of delay in the admission of urgent NHS cases.With private practice at its present level there can be little if any danger of it, but the issue is of considerable importance and is thereforedealt with in more detail in the following paragraphs.Hospital Waiting Lists16.   The fact that a patient with a condition not regarded as medicallyurgent can obtain hospital admission more speedily by paying for privatetreatment than as an NHS patient has become the* 1- 2 a day for an amenity bed compared with a cost ranging up to more than  20a day for a private patient in a medical or surgical ward.5
most controversial aspect of the existence of pay beds in NHS hospitals.The motive to become a private patient will itself in some cases have itsorigin in the existence of long waiting lists mainly for relatively non-vecgest operations, and-private practice is criticised on this account.Indeed, some members of the Committee took the view that becauseof &quot;queue jumping&quot; private practice should be forbiddenaltogether in certain circumstances.   The Committee expressed their concernat the level of waiting lists, a concern fully shared by the Government.The Committee concluded however that though the existence of private practice may sometimes have a marginal effect on their length, the problemof waiting lists is essentially due to other causes.17.   If facilities for private practice in NHS Hospitals were uncontrolleda situation could in theory arise in which private beds and private patientsusing them could^again in theory^ become so numerous as to affect NHS waitinglists seriously.   In fact this situation does not and will not arisebecause of the continued use of existing statutory controls on the amountof accommodation and services to be made available for private patients.18,   The relative numbers of beds and patients both NHS and private areillustrated in the following table which gives the situation ten years agocompared with the latest available totals:-Great Britain	1963	19711.   All beds	538,000	516,0002.   All beds except for mentally ill, mentally handicapped, chronic sick and geriatric	238,000	231,0003.   all patients treated	5,188,000	6,207,000		4.   surgical &amp; gynaecological beds	94,000	102,0005.   surgical &amp; gynaecological patients treated	2,500,000	3,000,0006.   pay beds	6,162	4,8837.   private patients treated	101 ,000	122,000
19. Thus the proportion of pay beds has remained at about 1$ of allbeds or rather over 2$ excluding those for the mentally ill, mentally handicapped, chroniO sick and geriatric patients, which are rarely usedfor private patients. Similarly the number of private patients treated inNHS hospitals has also remained for many years at about the same proportion -just under 2% - of all patients treated.   Membership of Provident Associationshas been growing, but even taking this factor into account there is no reasonto expect any very significant increase in this proportion in the foreseeable future,20.   Since 1963 waiting lists have increased from 521,000 to 578,000.   Over90$ relate to surgical specialties and gynaecology.   Even on the assumptionthat most private beds are oocupied by surgical patients their number cannot represent more than a very small proportion of the3 million or so NHS patients now treated annually.   And with more than  million waiting at one time, the average numberof private patients in NHS hospitals on any day (2,625) is less than 0.5$of all patients waiting for NHS treatment.   The total of private patientstreated in a year in NHS hospitals is about a fifth of the number on NHSwaiting lists at the end of that time.   (Of these private patients a proportionwould become NHS patients - urgent or non-urgent - if private beds were notavailable in NHS hospitals.)   It is therefore not surprising that changesin the level of waiting lists are unrelated to changes in the number of paybeds.   Between 1966 and 1969 when the number of pay beds was reduced by over22$ waiting lists actually   increased - by a little more than 4$. From the end of1969 to the end of 1971 when there was a small increase in pay beds (from 4,766 to4,883) waiting lists for the first time for many years showed a reduction ofabout 6$.   There are acute general hospitals with long waiting lists and fewor no pay beds, and some with shorter waiting lists and a large number of paybeds.21.   It is not to be expected that there should be a direct correlation betweenwaiting lists and pay beds.   Among the many factors affecting waiting lists arethe availability and staffing of beds and their geographical distribution, the availability of diagnostic facilities and theatres, the pattern of referrals toconsultants and above all the effective management and marshalling of resources.22.   Hatfing regard to the constantly changing relationship overall of the totalnumber of hospitals beds with the number of patients treated in them and thenumber on waiting lists, and bearing in mind the small proportion of pay bedsand private patients to the total, the existence of pay beds from the inceptionof the NHS and under successive Governments can have had at the very most only amarginal effect on waiting lists.   The existence of waiting lists is certainly not, therefore, in the Governmenfs view, an argument for ending the existenceof private facilities in NHS
hospitals.23.   The Government is however by no means satisfied with the delays that someNHS patients experience and the DHSS has been engaged on a reviewjointly with the medical profession   to ascertain the causes of unacceptabledelays and to suggest possible remedies.   The SHHD is reviewing itsinformation system in the same field and with the same purpose, and theposition in Wales is also under review by the Welsh Office and theVelsh Hospital Board.     This is not a matter for the present White Paper,but in view of the Committee&apos;s comments it is perhaps right to record that the DHSS review will take special account of the extent to whichunacceptable delays are due to a maldistribution of resources.       Thereis evidence that such maldistribution or inadequate organisation of resources are more likely causes of delay than - as suggested by theCommittee - any overall shortage of qualified staff and resources.Allegations of Abuse of the NHS24.   There are other criticisms of private practice contained in theevidence received by the Sub-Committee and discussed in the CoEimittee1sreport.   Some concern a few past lapses of managerial control leading touse of beds for private work without,or in excess of,authorisation.Evidence of specific cases is available and has been considered in detail.In some of these cases enquiries demonstrated no more than a degree ofmisunderstanding,    but there have also been clear breaches of theregulations governing the authorisation of pay beds.   Even in such cases there&apos;was little if any evidence to suggest that WHS patients had beenadversely affected.    I&apos;he necessary steps have been taken to deal withweaknesses in the relevant administrative processes and control procedures.25.   The removal of NHS equipment from hospital premises was also allegedby some witnesses.   But the same witnesses agree that in some casesprivate equipment was used for NHS patients.   The use of NHS equipment for private work in this way cannot he regarded as acceptable even if balaaocd
by loan of equipment to the NHS. but ma \encouragement  attention can ensure thatsensible arrangements are made according to local circumstances.Allegations were also made of &quot;borrowing&quot; of staff in working hours for operations outside the NHS and of charges to MS patients.     Suchpractices if substantiated would be within the scope of disciplinaryproceedings by hospital authorities.26.   There was a reference in some of the evidence to dissatisfactionfelt by staff whose work was concerned with private patients but who,unlike the consultants concerned received no fee.   In all such mattersit must be remembered that the private patient pays to the hospital a daily charge which includes all except consultant services, and thatthis includes an appropriate share of the services of all other staffin the hospital.   Thus it is within the functions of nursing, technical and junior medical staff to attend private patients as part of their normal duties and without a fee.27.   By far the most serious is the allegation of neglect   by someconsultants of their NHS duties, particularly if this should - as was said in evidence - put at risk   standards of care.   It was recognised, asthe Committee point out, that such neglect might arise from causes otherthan private practice.   Bad time-keeping was alleged to occur both in hospitals where private practice was allowed and where there was none.   In arldenoeit was agreed that there are instances of bad-time-keeping by whole-timeconsultants - that is by those with no private practice    as well as by part-time consultants.   It was common ground between critics and supporters of private practice that many consultants, with or without private practice, work with great zeal in the interests of the MS and its patients.28.   Apparent neglect of patients can arise from causes of which the complainant is unaware and which may justify the absence from clinicalduties of the consultant concerned. Thus the consultant may be occupied with administrative or educational responsibilities most or all of whichare of direct benefit to the MS, and in general a consultant&apos;s NHS9
activities will often embrace a number of responsibilities in additionto the direct clinical care of the patients in hio charge.   This coupled with the fact that treatment of patients must in general be a matter forthe skilled judgment of the consultants responsible for them,and the factthat many consultants will have NHS patients in more than one hospital,means that a consultant&apos;s contract is necessarily a fairly flexibleone which imposes on him responsibilities for the diagnosis and treatment and continuing clinical care of patients, but which does not include a mechanism governing time-keeping.29.   Instead, the assessment of neglect by a hospital doctor of his NHSduties must turn on consideration of the clinical care needed and given,of the level of delegation to junior staff and their competence, and of thedemands of clinical teaching and of other teaching and administrativeresponsibilities.   Availability when required in an emergency is alsorelevant.   In this matter both the NHS authorities and the   medical profession have and must exercise responsibility.   In so far as theexercise of clinical judgment is concerned, it is outside the Government&apos;sprovince and any assessments and action required must above all come asa result of an exercise of the responsibility which professional statuslays on the profession as a whole to maintain the standards of medical care.   The mechanisms required for this purpose exist, and there is anonus on all doctors, junior and senior, to protect the status of theirprofession by taking responsible action when it is clearly required.30.   It was said that   junior   doctors who might be in a position to observe any consistent neglect of clinical duties would jeopardisetheir career prospects by any action.    But such action would make it possible forresponsible leaders of the profession
to establish that a concern for high standards of medical care is a valuable and necessary attribute in a doctor holding or aspring to a seniorposition. In matters of criticism largely resting on clinical judgment itwould be only in the rare case where the solely professional mechanismfailed to operate that it would be right for hospital authorities torecognise a situation where their own action was needed.   In such a casethe NHS authority and ultimately the appropriate Secretary of State would need to consider exercising the relevant powers to deal with aspects ofthe matter beyond the sphere of clinical judgment.   But the government consider that such action should rarely if ever be called for ifinternal professional processes were properly applied.The Balance of Advantage31,   Thus it will be seen that the general conclusion reached by theCommittee and accepted by the Government, that there should be no major changes in the system, is based on an appraisal of numerous individualfactors.   Some show a clear advantage for the NHS: some might potentiallybe disadvantageous if inadequate controls were exercised, and these mustbe the subject of constant scrutiny.   Some factors, such as thoseconsidered in paragraph   24, carry the dangers which any abuse of anotherwise sensible arrangement will bring with it.   It is not possibleto be completely certain that this any more than any other system of suchsize and complexity will be entirely free from abuse.   Where it occursit must certainly be firmly checked and it is the Government&apos;s intentionto ensure that any specific evidence of abuse which may be received is fully investigated and that any necessary action is taken on it.   But the overall balance of all the factors here considered supports the conclusion referred to earlier, that private practice operates to the benefit of the nhs.Extent of facilities for private practice in NHS hospitals32.   Given this conclusion it   follows that the NHS should provide a due
proportion of facilities in the hospital service for private patients.The Government accepts, for the reasons given in the preceding paragraphs,that where there are doctors with part-time contracts entitled to practiseprivately, it is desirable to provide facilities for them to do so inNHS hospitals as far as it is reasonably possible to do so.   There are however some limitations.   It must be recognised that the vast majorityof people want, and will continue to want, to have treatment as NHSpatients, and that these are and must be the main concern of the NHS.33.   The demand for private treatment differs between areas.   As a rule, it will be possible to meet it without detriment to the needsof NHS patients.   But where total resources are inadequate for NHSneeds it may well not be possible to meet demand for private treatment in full.   This is less likely to occur where new hospitals are broughtinto use, and it is the Government&apos;s intention to look sympatheticallyon proposals to accommodate private patients in new district general hospitals.Authorisation of facilities for private patients34.   Under the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968 (&quot;the 1968Act&quot;) the amount of accommodation and services that can be madeavailable for private patients at a particular hospital requires the prior approval of the Secretary of State, although within the amountapproved, private patients can be accommodated in any part of thehospital.   The profession have represented that this requirementretains an element of inflexibility and that an authorisation of paybeds should apply to a group of hospitals instead of to a singlehospital, and even that there need be no detailed control of numbersbecause the Act referred to above provides that the authorisation of facilities for private patients shall not
prevent their use by a MS patient needing them more urgently on medical grounds and for whom no other accommodation is available.   The government considers that it is necessary to retain control over the amount of privatefacilities, but agrees that there is scope for greater flexibility intheir use as between hospitals.   In the   NHS Reorganisation Bill now beforeParliament there is therefore provision for a power to enable pay beds in Englandand Wales to be authorised for a group of hospitals, thus applying to the NHSgenerally the rules already existing for Teaching Groups run by a Boardof Governors.Provision in new hospitals35.   Differing views are held as to the most suitable way of planningprovision for private patients in new hospitals: whether it should bein single rooms distributed among.the various wards, or concentrated inone area of a hospital.   Both methods have their advantages and disadvantagesand either method is acceptable from a planning point of view, provided it does not entail increased costs and provided the acooamodationwill be used for NHS patients either if their medical condition calls forpriority in treatment or at times when it is not in use for private patients.With these provisos it is considered that this should be a matter primarily for local decision in the light of the operational policies for thehospital concerned and taking into account the preference of theconsultant staff.   But the Government does not favour the provision ofphysically separate pay bed blocks in new hospitals.   They are not in theinterests of patients generally because they are widely separated fromdiagnostic and treatment facilities, because they are more expensive toprovide, service and run, and because it is more difficult to ensureflexibility in their use and to make such beds available for NHS patientswhen it is appropriate to do so.36.   Where it is envisaged that consultants will be authorised to see and
treat their private patients as out-patients or day patients, it is normally expected that they will make use of the out-patient accommodationprovided for NHS patients when not in use for that purpose, or other suitable accommodation. Circumstances in which the provision of accommodation specifically for use as private consulting rooms is justifiedwill be relatively rare.Hospital char,?e3 to private patients37.   Since the beginning of the NHS it has boen a principle accepted by successive Governments that private patients should pay the full cost ofthe accommodation and services provided for them.   Until 1969 in-patientcharges were determined by hospital authorities for particular hospitals,based on the running cost of the private accommodation or of the hospitalas a whole.   With the coming into operation of the 1968 Act the chargeshave been centrally determined for classes of hospitals and based on theestimated current average in-patient costs of the hospitals in the class.38.   The charges have been criticised in general as being too high forthe standard of accommodation provided in some hospitals, and in particular on the ground that some of the hospital costs taken into account in determining them are not relevant to the services provided to private patients.   It has also been represented that private patients shouldnot have to pay the full cost of accommodation and services to which theyhave already contributed through direct and indirect taxation.   But theconverse has also been argued and it has been said that the charges are too low and represent an element of subsidy from (government funds because it is alleged that private patients receive, and indeed expect, a particularly high standard of amenity and;non-medical service.39.   Any system of charges based on average costs can produce anomaliesas between individual patients, both as regards accommodation and services.On balance the Government considers the present manner of determining
charges based on average costs for classes of hospitals to be the most satisfactory.   It also considers it right in principle that patientswho have chosen to be treated privately rather than as WHS patientsshould pay charges designed to meet the full cost of the accommodation and services.Conclusions and recommendations of the Report of the Expenditure Committee40.   The conlusion of the Committee that private practice operates to the overall benefit of the HHS has already been referred to.    It is the view onwhich the Government bases its policy on private practice and it isproposed to accept the recommendation that no major changes to the systemare needed and to continue to make facilities available in NHS hospitalsfor the treatment of private patients to the extent that this can be done without detriment to NHS patients-.41.   The Committee recognised that abuses may occur from time to time inthe private sector in NHS hospitals as they may in any large organisation,and the Government shares the view that such abuses are   not to be condoned.The Government notes that the Committee do not believe such abuses to be widespread or of any magnitude, but accept the second recommendation that control procedures in hospitals should be more strictly observed.42.   within the framework of the governing legislation and of the guidance issued by the Central Departments,hospital authorities areresponsible for the local administration of this as of other parts of thehospital services.   It is the aim of the Central Departments and of thehospital authorities, as it will be of the new authorities to beestablished on the reorganisation of the Health Service, to see that all parts of these services are administered efficiently and fairly, and that15
any shortcoming in the administration or abuses in its application thatcome to light are investigated and appropriate steps taken to deal v/with the situation, prevent recurrence and to make for greater efficiency.43.   Through the contacts between the Central Departments and hospital authorities, the work of the departments  auditors and the exchangesbetween the Departments and the representatives of the professions, thesystem is under constant   review.   Guidance will continue to heissued from time to time to hospital authorities and their successors onways of improving it.44.   Next, the Committee recommend that all charges for private patientsshould be reviewed regularly at least every two years.   The charges for private resident patients are determined amually as required by Section 1of tiie 1968 Act.   There is no similar statutory requirement for anannual determination of charges for private non-resident patients butthe Government accepts that the normal practice should be to review them at least every two years and to determine new charges should the reviewshow this to be necessary.45.   The Committee refer in paragraph 21 of their Report to the size ofthe discretionary capital element in the pay   bed charges, which at thattime was  1 a week.   This was the amount included in the first determination of charges made by the previous administration under the 1968 Act.   TheGovernment increased this amount to  3 a week from 1 April 1972    and will continue to keep it under review.46.   The Committee&apos;s fourth and final recommendation was that morepublicity be given to the availability of amenity beds.   The government accept this recommendation and the Departments have beenconsulting with the hospital authorities as to the best ways of ensuring that &apos;.the.;:existence and availability of amenity beds are made better known,so that patients who desire privacy but do not wish to become private
patients are encouraged to make use of this facility.   Advice on thematter is about to be issued to hospital authorities.47.   Lastly the Committee ended their lleport by the conclusion on waitinglists which was referred to in paragraph 16 above.   The Committee statedthat the matter was outside their remit, but it is clearly relevant to current attitudes to private practice.   The Government accepts that theproblem of HHS waiting lists requires urgent consideration.   preparations to this end are in hand and an announcement of action to be taken will bemade shortly.Department of Health and Social security london   SE120 March 1973
