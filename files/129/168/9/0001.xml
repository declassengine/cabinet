THIS&apos;DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 29 COPY no. 5 March 1973CABINETREMUNERATION OF SCOTTISH COUNCILLORSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. The Ministerial Committee on Regional Policy and the Environment,at their meeting on 21 February, considered a proposal that regionalcouncillors in Scotland should be remunerated by way of a salary ratherthan by attendance allowances;  and I undertook to seek the views of theCabinet on the important issues of principle and practice which it raised.2. The rationale of this proposal is almost entirely political,,    TheSecond Reading debate on the Local Government (Scotland) Bill made clearthat there would be sustained pressure from Scottish Members of all parties, including our own, to amend the Bill to provide salaries for at least regional councillors in place of the proposed system of attendanceallowances.    Such an amendment seems fairly certain to be carried in theScottish Standing Committee.3. At our meeting it was suggested that the right course in thesecircumstances would be for us to accept the proposal for regional butnot district councillors in Scotland.    It was argued that if we sought to reverse at Report Stage a decision reached by the Scottish StandingCommittee, we should be accused of using the votes of English and welsh Members to deny the wishes of Scottish Members, and that thiswould cause intense resentment.    Moreover, even if we were successful in the Commons, it was by no means certain that the position could be heldin the Lords,    It was also suggested that, although the proposal was madelargely on political grounds, there were in fact certain arguments inprinciple which could be advanced for making such a change^    In particular,the Royal Commission on Local Government in Scotland - the WheatleyCommission - had been unanimous in their recommendation that salariesshould be paid to all councillors in Scotland,    In reaching this conclusion,they had been influenced inter alia by the size of the regions and thedemands which would be made on regional councillors.    These are factors which might give grounds for differentiating between councillors in theScottish regions and councillors in the Scottish districts and in the newEnglish and Welsh counties and districts, and thus for preventing anyrepercussions outside Scotland.
4. As against this, it was argued that it would be wholly undesirable that there should be any departure from the principle that membership ofa local authority is a voluntary and not a salaried service,,    TheGovernment had firmly accepted this principle at the time of locaxgovernment reorganisation in England and Wales; and to depart from it would involve a fundamental change in the character of local government.Even to make such a change in relation to a limited area of localgovernment, if it was arguable that there were special circumstances,would set a precedent which would almost certainly not be overlooked.If regional councillors in Scotland were, with the Government^ agreement,paid by salary, there would almost certainly be increasing pressure for similar arrangements to be extended to district councillors in Scotland,to members of local authorities in England and Wales, and probably alsoto members of other public bodies, for instance, members of regional and Aroa Health Authorities.    Such pressure would be difficult to resistonce the principle had been conceded.    We have also to take into account the cost implications.    It was argued that since there is a tendency inScotland to proliferate meetings in order to qualify for more attendanceallowances, the payment of salaries at a realistic level will encourageefficiency and may even save money.    On the other hand, it was suggestedthat it was in practice unlikely that the level of salaries could be based on anything but a generous interpretation of the average number of attendances,and this was likely to result in higher expenditure than would otherwise benecessary, and if salaries spread to England and Wales, the extra cost would be a great deal more.    Moreover, although the proposal would notbe directly covered by the terms of the Counter-Inflation Bill we cannotignore its relationship to our counter-inflationary measures.5,        Since opinion in the Ministerial Committee on Regional Policy andthe Environment was divided, I invite the Cabinet to consider whether ornot we should accept a system of salaries for regional councillors inScotland.R home office March 19732
