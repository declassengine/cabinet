SECRETIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTGOCP(73) 27 COPY NO26 February 1973CABINETFRAMEWORK FOR A SETTLEMENT FOR NORTHERN ireland note by the Secretary of State for Northern ireland. I have now reached the point where I can put before my colleagues the main outline of my proposals for the future government of NorthernIreland,    These are summarised in the Annex to this paper    If they are agreed, I will circulate in the very near future a draft of a White Paperpresenting and explaining them.2.        The settlement will necessarily have to be complex since we arewriting a new constitution for the Province and it is important, in considering various aspects of the settlement, not to lose sight ofcertain basic points.    These area. Any scheme will have to be worked by elected representatives in Northern Ireland.    Our settlement must, therefore, be suffiently acceptable to moderate opinion in both communitiesof Northern Ireland for them to co-operate in working it;  and itmust avoid giving the extremists in both communities any plausiblejustification for taking their opposition into the streets and factories.    This is far from easy.    On one hand, we have got to find something which the majority community is likelyto find acceptable and I am in no doubt that this means a considerabledevolution of powers; and, on the other hand, and equally important,we must offer the minority community a prospect of an end todiscrimination and second-class citizenship and of participation in government,b. We just do not know who will become Northern Irelandrepresentatives after the next election there.    Our settlementmust, therefore, be proof against the outcome of that election,whatever it is.    It follows that we must, while being absolutelyfirm on essentials, allow ourselves sufficient flexibility to dealwith the actual situation following the first election to the assembly and, indeed, subsequent elections since they may substantiallychange the Party structure within the Northern Ireland assembly.This issue arises particularly in relation to the procedure forchoosing an executive.SECRET
secret. As we acknowledged in the Paper for Discussion, theattitude of the Government of the Irish Republic is going to be important if the settlement is to have any chance of permanentsuccess.    It is, therefore, necessary to have regard to the viewsof Mr Lynch (or his successor); he will in particular want to besatisfied that our proposals protect the minority community and give them a part to play in the government of the Province andhe will look particularly at the &quot;Irish Dimension11 of the settlement,d. We need to know that the Opposition can be relied upon tosupport v.e.j    A bipartisan approach is vital since if any of theParties in Northern Ireland think that they can look to the Oppositionto oppose what, we are doing and promise different things if theywere to come to power, there is little hope that a settlement willstick.    It is, in particular, important that we pcy due regard totheir view that Northern Ireland representation at Westminstershould not be increased and that we should provide for some formof &quot;Bill of Rights&quot;.3.        It is asking a good deal of the settlement to meet all of the abovepoints.    I think, however, that the framework of a settlement as set outin the Annex to this paper gives us a good basis.    If my colleagues aresatisfied with the proposals in Jhe Annex, I will bring before them a draftof the White Paper.    It is essential that we publish that White Papertowards the end of March in time for debates in both Houses on the affirmative resolutions which I must seek before 30 March in orderto renew the Temporary Provisions Act.    My intention would be assoon as possible after the renewal of that Act to publish and present to Parliament a constitutional Bill giving effect to what is set out inthe White Paper with the hope that it will be through both Houses bythe late spring.    I would then go ahead as quickly as possible with thenext stages in the settlement - that is, with elections, the calling togetherof the assembly, discussions on the method of choosing an executive,formation of an executive in accordance with the formula agreed withthe Parties and the devolution of the &quot;transferred&quot; powers.    It isimportant that the whole process should be completed as soon as possible.W WNorthern Ireland Office26 February 1973SECRET
annex the Assembly1.     The essential first step after the passage of the Bill is toelect a new assembly so that v/e can satisfy the wish of many people in Northern Ireland to resume some form of self-government and canlighten&apos; the legislative burden on Westminster.    There is a good dealof agreement here and. in Northern Ireland about the nature of such an assembly.    It should be a single chamber and have more members thanthe present Stormont House of Commons - say, an increase from 52 to 80or so.    Its procedures (which we can hardly lay down in an Act but which we can influence in an interim period of consultations betweenthe passing of the Act and the devolution of functions) should besimpler than those operated at Westminster and should to some considerable extent operate through a Committee system, on v/hich Icomment below, comprising members of that assembly.2.     As to elections to it. I am in no doubt that v/e cannot wait toredraw constituency boundaries: the method of election will, therefore,have to employ existing constituency boundaries.    I am consideringfurther the precise method of election but the two main possibilitiesappear to be the use of the 12 Westminster constituencies as a basis for the multi-member stv system of proportional representation or asystem analogous with that used in Federal Germany whereby a straightforward Westminster-type election for the present 52 Stormontconstituencies would be followed by an allocation of additional members to bring the strength of the parties into proportion to their shareof the total popular vote.    Either method would give the minorityparties more hope of better representation in the new assembly andmight encourage those parties to join together so that they canexercise more power and influence in that assembly.The Executive3.     One of the most difficult questions facing us is how an executive should be formed and whether we should go firm on this in the constitutional Bill or leave it for discussion between theSecretary of State and representatives from the Northern ireland assembly after the election.    My view is that it would be an undesirable hostage to fortune to lay down, in advance precisely how the executive would be formed since much depends upon the composition of the new assembly which cannot be forecast in advance.    If v/ewere to say now precisely what we wanted, we might prejudice the wholesettlement in advance since the Unionist party in particular mightreject this essential clement of it.    In the White Paper we should concentrate on the essential conditions for selecting an executivewhich will have to be met if they are to be acceptable to us.    Itcould then be left to the Cabinet to prescribe the machinery by some form of subordinate instrument provided for in the constitutional Bill.4,     The essential conditions for selecting an Executive are, in broad terms, that the powers of the executive should not be concentrated in the representatives of one community only, and thatthe system adopted must be one which can and will be workedeffectively by those concerned.    I am inclined to think we should sayno more in the White Paper; the issue is at the heart of theconstitutional settlement and any firm proposals would carry the risk
of entrenched positions being adopted by some parties from the outset.For the information of my colleagues, however, I am satisfied thatsimply reserving a number of p?i.aces in the executive for Catholicsis unacceptable; the idea of a &quot;statutory Catholics&quot; would be rejected by the Unionists and would be inimical to the interests of the partiesattracting support from both Protestants and Catholics such as the alliance Party.    There is, however, a good deal to be said for providing that all par-ties with a specified number of seats shouldhave a right to a place in the executive if they wish to take it up;and even more to be said for a scheme by which a panel of members ofthe assembly, elected by a weighted vote (say 75%) by all members ofthe assembly, act as Heads of Departments since this would makenecessary some form of coalition government.    At the end of the day,however, I suspect that we may have to resort to a fall-back positionof appointment by the Secretary of State (perhaps from such a panel)because of deadlock about a system to be adopted or the division ofparticular portfolios.Committee system5.     Most of the more responsible Northern Ireland parties now favoursome kind of Committee system and I think that we should provide in theWhite Paper that members of the assembly shall have an opportunityto serve on Committees which will have the right to be consulted byHeads of Departments on the developments of new policy and to review in detail the activities of new departments under devolutionary powers.I have it in mind that a Committee should be established for eachfunctional department in Northern Ireland and that its membershipshould as far as possible be in proportion to the strengths of theparties in the assembly.    The objective will be to create a uniquesystem of full participation by members of the assembly in the evolution and development of policy.    The Committees will be intendedto be not merely a check on the executive process but an integral part of it.    Thus the Head of a Department v/ill be expected in proposing a new law or policy to the executive to have first broughthis committee into as full consultation as the circumstances allow.Devolution of Functions6.     Once we are sure that the assembly, and an executive formed from it, v/ill work, we should devolve to them extensive powers.    If theparties of Northern Ireland are to be expected to act responsibly andif people of the right calibre are to come forward for public office,we shall have to make clear in the White Paper that we intend to devolveto them a full range of powers.    Broadly speaking, these powers will cover the functions of the existing Northern Ireland Departments withthe exception of important functions of the Ministry of Home affairs and the Attorney-General.Reserved Functions7.      So long as the Army plays a dominant role in preserving lav/ andorder in Northern Ireland and emergency conditions still apply there,we shall have to reserve &quot;law and order&quot;.    Broadly speaking I have itin mind that we should reserve for the time Ministerial functions inrelation to the police, the courts (thereby bringing about a unifiedcourt system) certain aspects of the criminal law, special and emergency powers, prosecutions (the Attorney-General keeping his present functions) prisons, probation and a number of other matters which at present fall to the Ministry of Home Affairs, such as the
prerogative of mercy,  elections and the franchise.    Some of these functions vri.ll have to remain with us for a very long time, butpresentationally we should not rule out the possibility that responsibility for some of them may be returned to Northern ireland in due course.    In the meantime, we should plan for some localinvolvement in matters of la,w and order.    This might be achieved by setting up a Security Council with representation on it from theassembly and by incorporating in a police authority an elected element.Further, I think it would be wise to provide for- consultation with thenew executive so that they can advise on reserved matters generally.Secretary of State for Northern Ireland8.     This scheme seems to me to require the continued existence of an office of a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.    As I see it, theSecretary of State Will be a member of the British Government and a link between that Government and Parliament on the one hand and theNorthern Ireland assembly and the executive formed from it on the other.He will exercise direct ministerial responsibility for certain reservedservices (paragraph 7 above); he will represent Northern Irelandinterests in the Government both generally and in relation to theallocation of financial resources; and in respect of the main bodyof Northern Ireland services for which responsibility will be devolved to Northern Ireland institutions, he will maintain close,continuous and constructive contact (particularly since the NorthernIreland institutions will spend money provided by the United Kingdomand in many matters deal with functions with e.c. implications).    TheSecretary of State will be the ultimate safeguard of the minority community.Bill of Human Rights9.     We shall have to include provisions in the constitutional Bill fora Bill of Rights (as it is often loosely called) if we are to carry the minority community and the Westminster Opposition with us.    As a start, we shall have to provide for restraints in the law-making and executive powers of Northern Ireland institutions so as to ensure, andto demonstrate, that they cannot act in a discriminatory way.    I amalso considering whether we might set up some sort of co-ordinatingmachinery which might bring together existing institutions in NorthernIreland which act in this field.    As to the much wider questions ofprivate actions and private rights, valuable work is being done by a working Party under the chairmanship of Mr van Straubenzee and involvingboth employers and employees, on discrimination in employment - thisis the vital area of discrimination - and it will be possible in theWhite Paper to refer to this.    The Working Party will be providingme with an interim report saying that they propose to recommend thatthere should be a declaration of equality of employment opportunity,a code of employment practice and a Fair Employment Commission with power to investigate individual cases, to enquire into patterns ofemployment, to conciliate and in the last analysis to take cases beforethe civil courts.    We shall I think have to legislate on this at westminster but this will follow, and not precede, the constitutionalBill.The Irish Dimension10.    If we are to secure the acqulesence or even support of Mr Lynch,we shall have to include provision in the constitutional Bill for closer co-operation between Northern Ireland and the Republic ofIreland.    It is noteworthy that all the Northern Ireland political
parties included in their proposals some sort of scheme forinstitutional arrangements between the Worth and the South.   We havea tightrope to tread here.    On the one hand, we have to avoid arousingthe fears of the majority community and this means that the proposalfor a Council of Ireland must be part of a wider settlement; on theother, we have got to satisfy the minority community and the Governmentof Ireland that we really mean business.    A major problem is that if,as the South expect, there are to be links both at governmental and parliamentary levels, then the Northern Ireland assembly and executivewill expect to be consulted about the form, functions and procedures of the new institutions.    This suggests that it might be best to begin with co-operation between officials leading in due course to wider andmore representative institutions.    As to the constitutional Bill, weshall have to provide that nothing in it inhibits the new assemblyor its executive from engaging in co-operative efforts in the South.There might be advantage in associating with such provision arestatement of the guarantee that the territorial status of NorthernIreland vail not be changed without the consent of the people ofNorthern Ireland.    I think too that we should announce in the white paper that following elections to the Northern Ireland assembly, we intend to invite the Government of the Irish Republic and representativesof all parties of the assembly to take part with us in a conference todiscuss how a Council of Ireland might be developed.    This would reassure the Government of the Republic; it would bring home to the NorthernIreland assembly that we wish them to take a full part in thedevelopment of such institutions; and it would enable us to raisewider matters such as concerted governmental and community actionagainst terrorist organisations and the acceptance of the then status of Northern Ireland by the Government of the Republic.    Such aconference is broadly in line with the views of the Opposition in thiscountry.Representation of Northern Ireland at Westminster11.    The argument whether we should increase the representation ofNorthern Ireland in Westminster turns in the main upon our intentionto reduce responsibility in a new Northern Ireland assembly and executive by reserving some subjects permanently and others for the foreseeable future.    But if there is a possibility that some subjectsmay be returned to the Northern Ireland assembly in due course, thecase falls: Northern Ireland representation at V/westminster cannot go up and down depending upon how far we return to Northern Irelandinstigations responsibilities in the field of law and order.    The otherarguments in favour of an increase are that Northern Ireland is aremote part of the country and we have usually been more generousin the representation of remote areas; that virtually that all theprovince&apos;s taxation will be levied at Westminster and the total of this expenditure controlled from there; and that the events of 1972/73 have demonstrated that the ultimate power over Northern Ireland is at westminster and that the Secretary of State who will play such anImportant part in Northern Ireland affairs is answerable to V/westminster.There is pressure in Northern Ireland for increased V/estminsterrepresentation at the present stage but in my judgement it is not likely to be a breaking point, and we are sure to meet with hostilityfrom the Opposition if we propose to increase such representation.It is also relevant that the Kilbranden Commission may have something to say on representation as it affects other parts of the United kingdom as well as Northern Ireland.    On balance, I think that we should leavethings as they are, but that if pressure develops, we might proposereferring the matter to the Speaker&apos;s Conference.B
