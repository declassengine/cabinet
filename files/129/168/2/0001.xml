HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 22 COPY NO21 February 1973CABINETREORGANISATION OF THE NUCLEAR DESIGN and construction industry memorandum by the Secretary of State for trade and industry. I have considered further our discussion at our meeting on19th February of the reorganisation of the nuclear industry.    It seemsto me that the points particularly concerning my colleagues were theextent of the Government1 s control over the new design and construction(d/c) company, the manner in which this conrrol should be exercised,and the role that the d/c company would play in nuclear research anddevelopment (R and D).THE GOVERNMENT&apos;S CONTROL,2. The reasons for choice of the General Electric Company (G.C)to lead the new company are explained in my memorandum CP(73) 15;I see no alternative to G.C.    But I understand my colleagues1reluctance to place too much power in GECs hands.    For this reasonell the exploratory discussions with G.C have been on the basis of theGovernment retaining certain powers over the d/c company&apos;s activities.In any structure of the company it is vital that the Government maintaincontrol over the strategy of civil nuclear policy and key decisions onsuch matters as the choice of reactors to be built here, the broad linesof R and D and allocation of necessary funds, and the rights to thetechnology of the Atomic Energy Authority (sea).    But G.C must begiven clear responsibility for management and marketing.3. In the future such Government control will be supported by advice from the Nuclear Power Advisory Board (NPBA) whose functions andmembership I describe in CP(73) 15.    But to supplement our existing powers we will reserve special righfes over the new company&apos;s policieson:-a. purchasing, which is to be open;b. formation of international links1
c. issues relating to R and D affecting the AEAd. alteration in share capitale. ultirrate control of the management if the company isnot a G.C subsidiary.THE GOVERNMENTS STAKE IN THE COMPANY4. The choice is between: -1. a G.C subsidiary in which the Governments reservedrights would be attached to our minority snareholding;    and ii.       a company in which G.C would have a minority stakematched by that of Government, the management authorityof G.C and the Government&apos;s reserved rights being defined in a management agreement.(Such structures, and the reserved rights are detailed in the attachedAnnex which was earlier circulated to the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy).5. The arguments on size of our shareholding and that of G.C arein Annex I of CP(73) 15.    The problem is of balance between ensuringsufficient G.C commitment and protecting the public interests.    Iindicate my preference in CP(73) 15.    If, however, my colleagues have serious reservations about giving G.C majority control despite the safeguards I list above,  which would be assured by minimal shareholding,I am very ready to consider and discuss this question further with theprincipal parties concerned.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT6. Finally on the question of direction a.nd supervision of reactorR and D I share the view that the d/c company must play a major rolesince the lack of commercial orientation has been a weakness of paststructure.    This will be achieved firstly by the d/c company formulatingthe reactor R and D proposals for the Government to consider on advice of the NPAB; and secondly by applying the customer/contractorrelationship to the R and D contracts which would be executed by the sea.7.        I invite the Cabinet to agree that -i.       the d/c industry should be reorganised on the basis ofa single private sector company led by G.C;2
ii.       if colleagues have reservations about it being a GECsubsidiary when I will explore further as indicated inparagraph 5;iii. in either event negotiations with G.C should be concluded before any announcement would be made;iv. I should establish the NPAB as outlined in CP(73) 15.P w department of Trade and Industry21 February 19733
ANNEX iii of ES(73)2OUTLINE OF ALTERNATIVE STRUCTURES FOE THE PROPOSED COMPANYFinancial &quot;backingIssued share capital would &quot;be  10m initially &quot;but with only 20%paid up.2.     This would provide sufficient working capital for the new company to complete the five Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors (AGR).     It wouldalso provide sufficient working capital to start on a further domesticprogramme once one is approved.J.     But it would not provide sufficient overall financial backingto cover potential liabilities on delivery and performance for freshcontracts - either domestic or overseas.   These could be very substantial: up to the full value of each contract, unless limited byagreement with the buyer; the main buyer, the CEGB have suggested a40% liability on contracts for the nuclear part of the station, worthover  100m.     Such liabilities arise only at the end of a project,after a building programme of 5-6 years or more.   The new company would follow the practice in the existing consortia and provide against themby guarantees from the shareholders (with supporting but more limitedguarantees from component suppliers).A company in which Government and G.C hold 40% each4,     In this case a two-tier structure has been proposed: a holdingscompany and an operating subsidiary.    G.C would oe appointed managers of the operating subsidiary under an agreement that gave them overallmanagement control of the operations.   They would receive a fee from theholdings company, yet to be determined but related to the servicesthat they supply.5.     G.C would hold 40% of the shares with 1 vote each: the other companies would collectively, through British Nuclear Holdings, have20% with votes only on specific issues such as dividend policy and government (through the sea) would hold 40% also with 1 vote each.The Government shares would carry 2 votes each and hence majority on:-(a) purchasing policy - to ensure that this was open;(b) the formation of international links;(c) issues relating to R &amp; D affecting the sea;(d) alterations of share capital;(e) the appointment or removal of G.C as Managers or extensionsor variations of the management agreement.
6.     Government would receive regular information on a basis to be specified.7.    Membership of the holding company1s board would be agreed jointlyby Government and G.C.8.     Government could terminate the management agreement at any time butGEC could not end it until the end of the first 5 years.   GECs sharescould only be sold if the agreement is cancelled and the Governmentwould have the right to purchase at a fair value or to authorise sales to a third party.   Guarantees would be given by G.C and Government tothe extent of 50% each (BNH being excluded because of their limited role).9.    A G.C subsidiary in which Government and BNH have sharesA two-tier organisation would not be necessary as the company being a G.C subsidiary, would be managed by them.   Special voting rights wouldbe needed for the Government holding to safeguard the reserved rightslisted in para 5*     The Government shares could also carry the entitle-ment to representation on the Board.   They would be required to share inthe guarantees along with G.C.   The BNH shares would carry normal rights.A 100% G.C company10.   G.C would set up this company on the normal lines of theirsubsidiaries.11.   G.C would be required to give satisfactory assurances toGovernment with regard to its pursuing an open purchasing policy and toobtain Government approval to the formation of international links for nuclear reactors.   The responsibility for reactor R&amp;D would have tobe clearly defined with the sea.
