DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 3921 March 1973CABINETMORTGAGE FUNDS FOR PRIVATE HOUSEBUILDINGMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. Although I accept the importance of maintaining a high level ofprivate house construction, I cannot agree with the proposals of theSecretary of State for the Environment set out in CP(73) 36 for thefollowing reasons:i. Unlike the Secretary of State&apos;s earlier proposals for exchequer loans or guarantees, this would be a direct subsidy to owner-occupiers, irrespective of need, at a time when theHousing Finance Act has been introduced specifically to takeaway indiscriminate subsidy from council house tenants.    Councilhouse rents in England and Wales will be rising 11 per cent on average in 1973, notwithstanding the standstill.ii. Relief is certainly unnecessary for the vast majority ofexisting owner-occupiers.    They have had the advantage cfsubstantial, untaxed capital gains; they enjoy substantial tax relief on mortgage payments;  and even at 9j per cent, the mortgage rate would be roughly aero in real terms, taking account of the rise in consumer prices,    Moreover the building societies have assured me that existing borrowers would be giventhe option of revised repayment terms to avoid any increase incurrent outgoings.iii. What is significant to first-time purchasers - and whatdetermines the price they are prepared to pay for a house - is their total mortgage outgoing.    This is governed in part by the mortgage rate and in part by house prices.    If the rate rises,the price they are prepared to pay for a house tends to fall.Knowing what we do about developers1 profits, I do not believethat a modest fall in house prices induced in this way would havethe adverse effect on the supply of houses which the Secretary ofState fears.    Nevertheless I agree with him that discussions shouldtake place with the building societies on the question of first-time purchasers and I am confident that the societies themselves can do much to alleviate this problem.COPY NOis *\
iv. I do not accept that the Exchequer cost of the scheme wouldbe within the range  20-  35 million for three main reasons:a. It is unrealistic to assume that this subsidy couldbe removed at the end of Stage 2,    Having once set a precedent for a subsidy in this field we shall find itdifficult to avoid repeating it every time mortgage rates are due to be raised.    And it may be just as embarrassing to have an increase in Stage 3,b. If we persuaded the building societies against their commercial judgment to bear half their losses, we shouldhave no alternative but to accept full responsibility for theirsolvency,    (The Chief Registrar considers this to be animportant point).    To avoid this we should have to meet their losses in full which would double the cost of the scheme.c. The Secretary of State admits that an investment rateof 6. 3 per cent may not be sufficient to ensure an adequacy of funds.    If the investment rate has to go higher, so will the subsidy.v. Given the importance of avoiding an increase in public expenditure and the pressures we have resisted (food subsidies,family allowances, tax thresholds) which would be more important to poorer sections of society., this expenditure could not be defended.Over three-quarters of those buying their own houses had incomes of 35 a week or more in 1971.    The Press have already generally accepted that an increase in mortgage rates is fully justified,2. I therefore recommendi, that the Government should not intervene to prevent anincrease in mortgage rates hatii. that urgent discussions should be undertaken with thebuilding societies on a. the problem of first-time purchasers,and b. for the longer term, a self-financing stabilisation scheme.A treasury Chambers21 March 1973
