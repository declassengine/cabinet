DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 21 COPY NO   b I21 February 1973CABINETTENANCIES OF HIGH RATEABLE VALUE DWELLINGS:POSSIBLE SHORT-TERM MEASURES TO LIMIT rent increases, AND TO PROVIDE SECURITY OF TENUREMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. I understand that it might be helpful to the cabinet considerationof CP(73) 19 on 22 February 1973 to have this further memorandum on:a. possible measures which might be taken for limiting rent increases for &quot;high rateable value (RV) tenants&quot; (and &quot;furnishedtenants&quot;) for the duration of Stage 2 of the Counter-Inflationmeasures, and which would not be prejudicial to any longer-termchange of policy which we might wish to make later;b, what security, if any, would also need to be provided;  andcs possible longer-term measures, especially fcr furnishedtenants.2. The main possibilities for controlling the rents of high RVtenancies for Stage 2 only would seem to be:a. To continue the Stage 1 standstill.b. To allow a small percentage increase in the recoverablerent, calculated by reference to an index, eg the Retail Price Index,c. To permit an ad hoc percentage increase - eg 5 per cent.3. The advantages of a continued standstill over a percentage rise aresimplicity whilst ensuring that the gap between a fair rent and the marketrent does not widen before any longer-term measure (eg to raise the RVlimits) is brought in.    On the other hand, a small percentage increasemight take some of the sting out of the control for landlords and be a little less prejudicial to our Housing Finance Act policy.    But any ad hoc orpercentage increase would be very difficult to administer:  a base rentwould have to be identified, with the County Court an arbitrator in case of dispute; provision would probably have to be made for grossing-up thepercentage increase to take account of the time that had elapsed since the rent was previously reviewed (some leases might be 5 or 7 years old);  andsome policing machinery would be required - all for a fairly short period.1
4. These practical issues also need to be seen alongside more fundamental objections to an index-type short-term solution:a. There would be pressure to suspend both the housing finance Act policy and the fair rent system to limit rent increases for council and other private sector tenants to a similar percentage.b, The development of a new form of rent control might cast ashadow over the fair-rents policy in the longer-term by suggesting that the fair-rent system was in some way defective.5.        So far as furnished tenants are concerned, an index system wouldbe much more difficult to implement and police, both because of the numbersof tenancies involved and because of the chaotic state of this market.Provided furnished tenants are given security for the period, it would seempreferable to rely on Rent Tribunals powers to determine a reasonablerent, which will in most cases be below the current market rent.    Thisavoids detracting from the jurisdiction of the Tribunals, and should be widely used by tenants if they know they cannot be immediately evicted forapplying for a rent registration.6. If it is decided to adopt a temporary measure to control rents, thebest solution therefore seems to be to freeze high RV rents and to rely onRent Tribunals for furnished tenants.7. Such measures would need to be accompanied by a measure of security if rent control was to be effective.    To do otherwise would be to risk evictions, particularly for furnished tenants.    The sort of measurewbicn might be most practical would be on the following lines:a. Any landlord who wished to secure possession of his property would be required to serve a notice to quit at least4 weeks before the proposed termination of the tenancy,b. The effect of a notice to quit would be suspended for the duration of Stage 2, save where, on application to the County Ccurt,the landlord was able to satisfy the court that the tenancy came within certain categories entitling him to possession,    (these would be laid down by Order, and be drawn from the Rent Acts -eg where the tenant defaulted on his rent;  broke the terms of hiscontract; was guilty of nuisance; neglected the property; or wherethe landlord had already contracted to sell the property, needed it for his own family etc).This system would be applied both to high RV and furnished tenants,overriding the jurisdiction of the Rent Tribunal in the second case.    Itmight need to be made retrospective to the date of any government statement on the subject, so as to avoid the possibility of eviction betweenthe announcement and the making of an Order.    The Counter-Inflation bill would need amendment to provide an appropriate enabling power.2
8. Even such short-term measures would seem very likely to commitus to eventual longer-term measures.    If rents are held down for aperiod, it becomes increasingly difficult to jump back to market levels;and once security has been given, it is much more contentious to removeit.    It may therefore be unrealistic to think of the short-term in isolation.9, Longer-term measures might take the following form:a. For high RV tenancies, raising the Rent Act RV limitsfrom  400 to 26u0, coverting them into regulated tenancies.b. For furnished tenancies, abolishing the concept of thefurnished tenancy, now widely under attack, and making a distinction between lettings in an owner-occupier&apos;s own house,which would continue to be treated as furnished tenancies underPart VI of the Rent Act, and lettings in separate dwellings(ie where the landlord was acting professionally) which wouldbecome regulated tenancies within the fair rent system,10,       To make these longer-term changes would require substantivelegislation which, if short-term measures were limited to Stage 2 only,would need to take effect before Stage 2 ended.    The longer-termprovisions for high RV tenancies could probably be foreshadowed in anOrder under the Counter-Inflation Bill.    Those for furnished tenancieswould be too complex to be handled in this way, and measures on thelines of the short-term provisions described in paragraphs 5 and 7 above would be required ad interim.110        It is accordingly for consideration whether short-term measures are worth contemplating in isolation, and, secondly, if long-term measures seem likely to be needed, whether we should opt now for an amendment to the Counter-Inflation Bill, and an Order, to achieve themeasures described in paragraph 10 above.G r department of the Environment21 February 19733
