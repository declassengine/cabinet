THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government,*?(73) 28 COPY NO   B 32 March 1973CABINETTENANCIES OF HIGH RATEABLE VALUE DWELLINGSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment, The Cabinet invited me at their meeting on 27 February to circulate a further memorandum on the scope and nature of possible measures ofprotection for tenants of high rateable value (RV) dwellings and possiblyfor those of furnished accommodation to alleviate hardship caused by theconjunction of a rapid increase in rents with the strict limitation of incomesnecessitated by counter-inflation policies, and to secure the whole-hearted support for these policies of the Inner London Members and of theGovernments supporters in the House of Lords.2, The Minister for Housing and Construction, in the debate on27 February on Mr Tugendhat:s amendment seeking to raise the rateable value limit in the Rent Acts to  600 in Greater London and  300 elsewhere,indicated that this was a matter to which the Government was giving serious consideration, and that measures would be introduced as necessary in theHouse of Lords to give effect to whatever remedial action might be foundto be appropriate.    On this assurance, the proposed amendment, whichwas supported by the Opposition, was withdrawn.    Although the statement would not be incompatible with a decision to take no further action, this isclearly impossible and undesirable.POSSIBLE MEASURES3. There seem to be four possible measures which could now be takenin the light of the cabinet earlier decision:a.        To leave tenants without security of tenure or rent controlbut to act on service charges and take steps to facilitate acquisition by tenants of the freeholds of their properties on a co-operativebasis.    Whilst this would go some way towards helping tenantsit would not deal with the central issues of rents and security,would be unlikely to satisfy the London Members, and could bevery expensive in public expenditure terms.    No amendment tothe Bill would be required.    I do not recommend this course.1
b. To raise the RV limits above the present figures of  400and  200 in London and outside respectively,,    This would deal effectively with the issues of rents, security and service chargesraised by the London Members,    It would require a comparativelysimple amendment to the Bill,    It could be presented as aconsolidation on the fair rent principle and on the existingRent Acts,    Raising the limits to  600 and  300 respectivelywould probably cover some 80 per cent of unregulated tenancies,would almost certainly include all tenants of concern to our supporters, and would laave out the really large mansion flat.Such a borderline seems fairly clear.    Lower figures, between 500 and  600 in London, would leave a larger free market ( 550would seem to cover about 70 per cent) but the borderline would beless distinct and our supporters might be disappointed that v/e hadbeen unable to accept their figures.c. To devise a new system of control.    This could take theform of either a continuation of the rent freeze introduced at Stage or of indexation (ie small percentage increases, perhaps related tomovements in the Retail Price Index) together with provisions for security.    This would be both difficult and complex to devise,particularly as regards security.    It might make it easier to resist longer-term controls and a percentage rise could be madeto appear fair in the context of Stage 2 of the counter-inflation policy.But either a freeze or indexed increases might well lead to further attacks on the Housing Finance Act policy which allows much higherpercentage increases for some tenants.    It seems very doubtfulwhether it could be made foolproof in the time available,d. To include measures for furnished tenants as well.    Itwould be impossible in the time available to make a radicalamendment to the Rent Acts, eg to convert furnished tenanciesinto tenancies protected by the Rent Act and to bring them withinthe fair rent system.    A temporising measure would therefore oerequired providing sufficient security of tenure to enable tenants togo to the Rent Tribunal to have a reasonable rent registered withoutfear of eviction.    It would be necessary to exempt a tenancy wherelandlord and tenant were sharing the premises.    Such a measure would also be extremely complex, be likely to give rise to considerable litigation, and, because of the nature of the furnishedmarket, might be unenforceable to a considerable extent.    It would show that the Government was acting for both classes of currentlyunprotected tenants without discrimination,,    But it could alsoseriously prejudice the supply of accommodation.2
TIMING4. New controls would have to run from Royal Assent though there is little serious risk of evictions in the interim, and could apply:a. For the duration of Stage 2 of the counter-inflation measures.b. For the duration of Part IE of the Counter-Inflation Bill.c0 In perpetuity.Stage 2 is too short a period to justify the complexities of regulatoryintervention.    It looks more logical to tie any provisions to the duration of Part II of the Counter-Inflation Bill and in theory this would not prejudice the longer term.    But it is likely that any new leases would be drawn up to expire at the end of Part II, facing us then with the prospect of massiveevictions and rent increases.    In practice any short-term measure almost certainly commits us to the longer term.conclusion. The London Members would be disappointed with any lesser measurethan their proposed amendment.    The Opposition at this stage haveexpressed support for such a measure.6. Raising the RV limits is the simplest yet most effective measurelegislatively.    I envisage that a landlord would be able to recover thehigher of the existing rent or the fair rent until such time as the fair rent overtakes the present rent, so avoiding massive reductions in rentswhich tenants have already been paying.    This would be acceptable to theLondon Members.    In all other respects, these tenancies would becomelike any other regulated Rent Act tenancies and an integral part of the fair rent system.7. New systems, devibed simply for counter-inflation policies, wouldbe much more complex, would put our Housing Finance Act policy more at risk, and would face us with the greatest difficulty of continuity in thelouger term if, as seems inevitable, we had to legislate to continue rent control  or this class of tenants.8, Inclusion of furnished tenants is the most technically difficult ofall the options.    Although the problems facing furnished tenants are oftensevere, regulatory intervention on its own might make their position evenworse,    I would like to bring forward proposals later for dealingcomprehensively with our worst housing areas where furnished tenantsare concentrated.recommendation . I recommend that we introduce amendments to the Counter-InflationBill at Committee Stage in the House of Lords to raise the RV limits from 400 and  200 for London and the rest of England and Wales to  600 and 300 respectively, subject to maintenance of the existing frozen rents until such time as fair rents overtake them.    This measure should apply for the duration of Part II of the Counter-Inflation Bill.    We should not now make provision for furnished tenants,G r department of the environment  March 1973
