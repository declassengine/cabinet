IntroductionThis Consultative Document contains four sections. It begins with an explain-nation of the document and of the Government^ proposals for further discus-sion of the Code, in Parliament and elsewhere, and for bringing it into operation.Section 2 contains the proposals for prices and pay intended later to be embodied in the Price and Pay Code, and Section 3 the proposals for the control of dividends, which will be administered by the Treasury. Section 4 deals with arrangements for notification of price and pay information to the Price Corn-mission and Pay Board, and with some other questions of organisation and procedure. An Appendix contains explanatory notes which may be helpful tothose considering the document.ParagraphsSection 1:Status of Consultative Document       ..      ..      ..      .. ..     1-3Subsequent steps ..      ..      ..      ..      ..      ..      .. ..       section 2: Prices and PayPart 1 Prices 5-general Principles        ............ ..       7Field of application      ..      ..      ........ 8-15Allowable cost increases         ..      ..      ..      ..      .. ..  16-31Relationship of price increases to allowable cost increases .. .. 32-37Prices and profit margins..      ..      ..      ..      ..      .. .. 38-48Investment        ..........      ...... 49Particular sectors         ..      ..      ..      ..      ..      .. .. 50-74Part II-pay general principles        ..      ....      ..      ..      .. .. 75-76Field of application      ..      ..      ..      ..      ..      .. .. 77-81Intervals between increases      ..      ..      ..      ..      .. ..      82The pay limit      ................83-93Individual pay limit      .............. 94Other improvements in pay and conditions........95-114Particular methods and systems of payment...... 115-124Part in-General 125Section 3: DividendsAdministration and general principles          ....... 126-127Field of application      ............ 128-130Dividend limit.............. 131-133Application to takeovers, new companies etc.         ..      .. 134-135Section 4: Machinery and ProcedureSpecial arrangements     ..      ..      ..      ..      ..      .. 136-138Notification, reporting and record keeping: prices   ..      .. 139-151Notification, reporting and record keeping: pay      ..      .. 152-158Statutory determination of pay or prices      ...... 159-161Appendix
SECTION 1Status of the Consultative document. The Counter-Inflation Bill now before Parliament requires the treasury to prepare a Code to which it will be the duty of the Price Commission and pay board to have regard in performing their functions, and which is to includepractical guidance for those concerned in decisions on levels of prices and pay.The Bill also requires a wide-ranging process of consultation before a statutory instrument containing the Code is made.2. The White Paper published on 17 January 1973 (A Programme for controlling Inflation: The Second Stage Cmnd. 5205), which was fully debatedby Parliament, contained an Appendix which was the first outline of the Code.This Consultative Document marks the next stage in the preparation of the code and provides a basis for the consultations envisaged in the Bill. It takes account of suggestions already made on the basis of the White Paper, as wellas of experience in the administration of the standstill. Section 2 fills in the out-line of the White Paper. However it does not at this stage represent a definitivestatement of the Governments views since it is open to alteration in the lightof consultation, of the views expressed in Parliament, and of further considera-tion by the Government.3. The proposals for the administration of dividend control by theTreasury are described as a basis for consultation in Section 3. An order underthe Counter-Inflation Bill after Royal Assent would give effect to this control.The notification and reporting arrangements discussed in Section 4 will also require a separate order or orders under the Bill and will not form part of the code. Here too the Government wish to consult those concerned on the scopeof the requirements and how they are to be defined. Proposals to serve as a basis for consultation are therefore included.Subsequent Steps4. The Government propose to publish before the end of March a white paper which takes account of consultations on this document and contains acomplete draft of the Price and Pay Code. The Code will only come into effect as a result of an Order made following Royal Assent to the Counter-InflationBill. This Order will bring into operation the control powers in Part II of theBill and will enable the Price Commission and Pay Board to exercise their powers under that part of the Bill. Subject to this, the standstill on pay and ondividends will end on 31 March 1973: the standstill on prices and house rentswill continue until 28 April.
SECTION 2Prices and pay. The Code will have a dual function. First, the Price Commission and pay board are required to exercise their powers so as to ensure that it is implemented.Secondly, it should be taken into account by all those concerned with the deter-mination of prices and pay.6. The Code will therefore be addressed both to the Agencies and to all those concerned with price and pay determination. Part I deals with prices and part II with pay.Part I-PricesGeneral Principles7.  The general principles relating to prices are: (i) to limit the extent to which prices may be increased on account of increased costs, and to secure reductions as a result of reduced costs;(ii) to reinforce the control of prices by limiting profit margins per unit of sales or turnover, while safeguarding investment;(iii) in all these respects to reinforce the effects of competition, and tosecure its full benefits in the general level of prices.Field of Application8. With the exceptions specified in paragraphs 9 to 14 below, the prices ofgoods and services supplied to the United Kingdom home market are within thescope of the control.9. The prices of goods and services exported (whether directly or through an agent) are not controlled.10.  The following are not controlled: (i) prices paid to overseas suppliers for imports;(ii) prices of goods and services where the application of the control wouldbe inconsistent with an international agreement or arrangement.For this purpose, an international agreement or arrangement is onebetween states or organisations of states, not between firms;(iii) prices at sales by auction, where such sales are a normal practice in theparticular trade;
(iv) prices of second hand goods (other than second hand road vehiclessold by distributors);(v) charges for international freight and passenger traffic. This exclusionapplies to charges for air navigation and landing services and to ship,passenger and goods dues, provided in each case that they relate whollyor mainly to such traffic. It applies also to international mail and tele-communication charges. It does not apply however to charges relatingwholly to domestic air or sea journeys, or to charges for coastal seatraffic;(vi) prices of ethical medicines supplied to the United Kingdom market tothe extent that regulation of their prices is within the scope of any agreement relating to those prices made between the Secretary of Statefor Social Services and representatives of manufacturers of thosemedicines; but only so long as such an agreement is in force; (J)(vii) insurance premiums. These will be subject to restriction by the Secretaryof State for Trade and Industry; (2)(viii) subscriptions to certain membership organisations as in paragraph 73.Application to Food and Fanning Products11. The prices of manufactured food and drink, like those of manufactured products generally, are within the scope of the control as are those of semi-processed foodstuffs such as butter, sugar and quick-frozen vegetables.12. The prices paid to United Kingdom producers or producers&apos; organisa-tions or to overseas suppliers for fresh foods (3) and similar products, which are subject to fluctuations on world and United Kingdom markets because ofseasonal factors or international changes in the relationship between supply and demand, are not controlled. This applies in particular to meat, including bacon and poultry, fish, eggs, fruit and vegetables. However, enterprises which resellthese foods, whether home produced or imported, at any subsequent stage willbe subject to the control on prices and profit margins.13. The retail price of milk for liquid consumption, and the margins of milkdistributors, will continue to be subject to the existing controls by the Ministerof Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (4). So long as these controls apply, the priceof milk will not be subject to the Code.14. What is said in paragraph 12 in relation to the prices paid for freshfoods applies also to prices of other primary products of animal or vegetableorigin, which are subject to fluctuations from seasonal causes or causes externalto the United Kingdom.Charges15. References in the Code to prices include references to charges, unless there is explicit provision to the contrary.0). O. (3) and C) - See Appendix
Allowable Cost Increases16. Enterprises may not increase prices in the domestic market, except to reflect increases in allowable costs per unit of output. Similarly, price reductions should be made to reflect fully any fall in costs.17. Subject to the following paragraphs, a cost increase may be regardedas an allowable cost increase for the purposes of paragraph 16 if: (i) it was first incurred after 30 September 1972 (5); and(ii) it was incurred for one of the following: (a) labour; (6)(b) materials, components or fuels;(c) rent of premises or rates;(d) interest charges, as defined in paragraph 21.18. Price increases made on the basis of allowable cost increases may, sub-ject to the other paragraphs of Part I of this Section, reflect the percentage increase in costs per unit of output since 30 September 1972, but may not include any element of recovery of cost increases absorbed between 30September 1972 and the date of the price increase.Productivity Deduction19. In order to ensure that the benefits of increased productivity are passed on to the consumer not more than 50 per cent of allowable cost increasesarising from pay increases may be passed on as price increases.Unit for allowable cost increases20. For the purposes of applying the allowable cost rules to price increases,the appropriate unit may be either an enterprise as a whole or a separate majorsub-division provided that in the latter case separate accounts of such sub-divisions: (i) are available for all relevant periods;(ii) are not affected by transactions conducted otherwise than on arms-length terms;(iii) would, if combined with one another and with the accounts of allother activities or transactions of the enterprise, produce the same result as that shown by the accounts of the enterprise taken as a whole.Any reference in this section to an enterprise includes a reference to a majorsub-division as defined above. Where an enterprise produces a range of productlines or services for which prices have in the past been calculated and announcedseparately, the established practice should be adhered to and price increasesbased on allowable cost increases should continue to be worked out separatelyfor each product line.(5) and (8)   See Appendix
Interest Charges21. Increases in interest charges payable by an enterprise are allowable cost increases, unless: (i) they represent a distribution of profits rather than a true interestcharge; or(ii) they are interest charges of a kind normally charged against the profitand loss account of the enterprise concerned; or(iii) where they arise on loans between related undertakings, they relate toloans which are not strictly required for the business, or are at a rateof interest higher than would be charged in a transaction at arm&apos;slength.Pay not consistent with the Code22. Increases in expenditure on pay or other conditions of service after5 November 1972 are allowable cost increases only to the extent that: (i) they were consistent with the policies set out in Cmnd 5125, with therequirements at the relevant time of the Counter Inflation (temporary provisions) Act 1972 and of any notice or order under it; or(ii) they are consistent with the Code or with the Counter-Inflation Billon enactment.23. Examples of increases in expenditure which are not allowable cost increases because they are inconsistent with the Code are: (i) any part of a pay increase which exceeds the pay limit, unless specifically -cally exempted from the limit by Part II of this section;(ii) any part of increases in earnings arising from piecework or payment by results schemes which exceeds the pay limit, except where thisarises directly from increased output;(iii) any part of increases in pay under settlements made at local or plantlevel which, when aggregated with increases under a national agreement,exceeds the pay limit for the group of workers concerned.Anticipation of Cost Increases24. Prices may not be increased in anticipation of future cost increases.Competitive tenders may however take account of future cost changes if thetenders are at fixed prices.Cost Increases before 1 October 197225. Cost increases first incurred before 1 October 1972 may rank as allow-able cost increases only if, on application, the Price Commission are satisfiedthat there are exceptional circumstances to justify this. The Commission will normally approve such an application only if there has been exceptional absorp-tion of cost increases by the enterprise concerned before 1 October 1972.
Exports and Domestic Prices26. Where an enterprise sells in both home and overseas markets and hasnot allocated costs between the two markets on a consistent basis, these costsmay be divided in proportion to the value of sales in each market in calculatingallowable cost increases for the home market.Stocks27. In taking account of the cost of stocks entering into current sales whencalculating allowable cost increases, enterprises should adhere to the accountingpractice they have followed consistently for the treatment of such costs.Transfer Prices28. Where the Price Commission are satisfied that prices, either of purchasesor of sales, which an enterprise proposes to regard as a basis for the calculation of allowable cost increases or of net profit margins differ from what they wouldbe if the goods or services had been transferred on an arms length basis, theymay substitute modified cost increases or profit margins.Costs of certain small enterprises29.  Where the Price Commission are satisfied that: (i) significant cost increases have occurred or are about to occur in asector of industry or commerce which includes a considerable numberof small enterprises, especially those providing services; and(ii) the information available to them indicates that these cost increases are likely to be of broadly the same order for a substantial number ofsuch enterprises, in respect either of some or of all the goods or services which they supply,the Commission may calculate and publish average allowable cost increases forsome or all of the goods or services supplied by that sector. These increasesshall then be taken as the allowable cost increases for the relevant goods or services.30. In calculating average allowable cost increases under paragraph 29 theCommission will take account of: (i) all relevant information available to them on cost increases for thegoods or services concerned, including information supplied by any trade association or other body which they consider is representativeof the enterprises concerned; and(ii) any other relevant provisions of the Code.31. The Price Commission will publish information about any averageallowable cost increases which they have determined under paragraphs 29 and30, together with an indication of any price increases which they regard asjustified under the Code on the basis of those average allowable cost increases.
Relationship of Price Increases to Allowable Cost IncreasesEscalation Clauses32. Price increases under escalation clauses which provide for automaticincreases in specified circumstances should not be applied, except to the extent that the increases are consistent with the Code, and in particular with the para-graphs relating to allowable cost increases and the limit on profit margins.Prices of Related Products33.  Where:-(i) allowable cost increases arise from one or more of a range of related products; and(ii) a price increase in respect of them is permissible under the Code,the enterprise need not relate the price increase for individual products withinthe range closely to the cost increase for each product. This applies however only if:-(a) it has been established practice to treat the range of products in thisway;and(b) the total revenue raised will not exceed the amount permissible underthe Code.Quantity or Quality Change, and New Products34. A reduction in quantity or quality is equivalent for the purposes of the code to a price increase.35. Quality change in goods or services, quantity change in sales units, orartificial creation of new products should not be used as a means of avoiding therequirements of the Code. Where the Price Commission form the opinion thatthis has been done, they may seek price reductions or disallow cost increases.Price Reductions36. Where there is a fall in raw material prices or in other allowable costs,this should be fully reflected in price reductions. In addition prices should bereduced where other factors (such as an increase in the volume of sales since thelast price increase) lead to a significant fall in allowable costs per unit.Losses37. Where an enterprise is making a loss, it may increase prices to cover itscosts.Prices and Profit Margins38. Prices should be determined so as to secure that net profit margins donot exceed the average level of the best two of the last five years of account ofthe enterprise concerned preceding 1 April 1973 (the reference level).
39. &quot;Net profit margin&quot; means the margin of net profit expressed as a percentage of sales or turnover. &quot;Net profit&quot; means the net profit, determined inaccordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied bythe enterprise concerned, which arises from trading operations in the UnitedKingdom after taking into account all expenses of conducting and financingthem, including depreciation and interest on borrowed money, but beforededucting Corporation Tax or Income Tax.Price Reductions where Profit Margin likely to be exceeded40. Where the reference level has been exceeded, or where in the light of interim accounts or other evidence it is likely to be exceeded, price reductions(or abatements in allowable cost increases) should be made corresponding to the actual or expected excess.Unit for Profit Margins41. In calculating net profit margins for the purposes of paragraph 38enterprises concerned with allowable cost increases must use the same unit(that is the enterprise taken as a whole or a major sub-division) as they use forthat purpose under paragraph 20. Enterprises subject to the control on gross percentage margins under the Code must use the same unit for that purpose andfor calculating net profit margins.Profit Margins and Indirect Taxes42. In making comparisons between net profit margins as a percentage of sales and the reference level, due account must be taken of the effect on margins of changes in purchase tax on goods and services sold. The comparison withearlier years should be made on a basis which excludes purchase tax in the period up to the end of March 1973 and excludes VAT from 1 April 1973 onwardsbut includes excise duties in both cases. Where an enterprise does not already have accounts showing separately the purchase tax element in the turnover of previous years, that element should be estimated on the basis of the best avail-able information. The methods which may be used include the following: (i) total purchase tax may be ascertained from purchase invoices and this total then deducted from tax inclusive sales; or(ii) if (i) is impracticable, the purchase tax element may be estimated by applying to the value of sales or purchases of goods charged to different rates of purchase tax appropriate factors derived from thoserates.(7)The Price Commission will publish information on the application of esti-mating methods for this purpose.Modified Base Period for Profit Margin Calculation43. Where an enterprise has traded for less than 5 complete years, or hastraded at a loss in one or more of the last 5 years, the reference level for para-graph 38 may be calculated as follows: (7)   See Appendix
(i) if there have been 4 years of trading, the average of the best 2; if 3 or  years, the best year; if 1 year, the net profit margin of that year;(ii) any year in which an enterprise made a loss may be treated as equiva-lent to a year of no trading and subparagraph (i) may be appliedaccordingly.44. For a new company formed from a reconstruction or amalgamation ofexisting companies the reference level will be calculated in relation to theaggregate net trading profits of the constituent companies as a percentage oftheir aggregate sales.45. Where the Price Commission are satisfied that the reference level of an enterprise, calculated as in paragraph 38 or 43, requires modification, forexample because of a major reconstruction of the enterprise during the baseperiod, or a major change in the character of its business, they may agree orstipulate a modified reference level which in their judgment gives effect to theprinciples of paragraphs 38 to 43 and paragraphs 46 to 48.Low Profits46. Where the net profit calculated as described in paragraph 38 or para-graph 43 represents a return on capital of less than 5 per cent, the enterpriseconcerned may calculate the level of net profit needed to produce a return of 5per cent on capital and may treat the corresponding net profit margin as itsreference level. &quot;Capital&quot; means the net assets employed excluding any part ofthem which is represented by borrowings, the interest on which is deducted in arriving at net profit as defined.47. In the case of a service enterprise of a kind appearing in SectionsXXIV to XXVI of the Standard Industrial Classification, (8) paragraph 46 maybe read as referring to a net profit margin of 1 per cent on turnover rather than to a 5 per cent return on capital.48. An enterprise with an annual turnover exceeding  1 million may applya higher reference level as permitted by paragraph 46 or 47 only after approval by the Price Commission.Investment49. Where the Price Commission are satisfied that in a particular case theapplication of the limits on allowable cost increases or on profit marginswould seriously impede investment by depriving the enterprise concerned of funds essential for that purpose, they may permit some departure from thoselimits. The enterprise must satisfy the Commission that the investment will infact take place.(8)   See Appendix
Particular Sectors50. The paragraphs which follow deal with the application of this part ofthe Code to certain important sectors. Unless there is express provision to thecontrary in those paragraphs, however, paragraphs 7 to 49 must be taken as applying to all enterprises.MANUFACTURING51.  Paragraphs 7-49 above apply in their entirety.DISTRIBUTIONLimitation of gross percentage margins52. Paragraphs 16-37 (allowable cost increases) do not apply to wholesalers,retailers or other enterprises engaged in distribution. However, in the deter-mination of prices for sales to the United Kingdom market, gross percentagemargins in distribution should not exceed the level of the last complete accountyear of the enterprise concerned ending before 1 April 1973, less an appro-priate deduction for the abolition of SET.53. &quot;Where the costs of particular goods to wholesalers or retailers risesharply (that is to say, substantially out of line with any general movement inthe price level), the enterprises concerned should reduce their percentagemargins to take account of the disproportionate increase in price.54. In order to assist enterprises to arrive at an appropriate reduction ofpercentage margins under paragraph 53, the Price Commission will, if satisfiedthat the sharp rises in costs referred to have taken place: (i) consult any body which they regard as representative of enterprisesaffected by the rise in costs and take into account information supplied by them; and(ii) calculate an adjustment to gross margins designed to&apos; prevent net profit margins from rising substantially on those products, provided they are satisfied that: (a) these cost increases are likely to be broadly similar for a sub-stantial number of such enterprises; and(b) the maintenance of existing gross percentage margins woulddisproportionately increase the profit margin on those goods; and(iii) publish information about the gross percentage margins which theyconsider might be justifiably used in the determination of relevantprices, in the light of (ii).55. Price reductions should be made when a distributors net profit marginhas exceeded the reference level or where in the light of interim accounts orother evidence the reference level is likely to be exceeded.
Gross Percentage Margins and Indirect Tax56. For the purposes of paragraphs 52 to 55, the gross percentage marginin the previous account year should be calculated as a percentage of salesexclusive of purchase tax and compared with the gross margin after abolitionof purchase tax as a percentage of sales excluding Value Added Tax (VAT).In the calculation of gross margins both purchases and sales should excludeVAT. Where enterprises do not already have accounts showing separately thepurchase tax content of their sales in earlier years, it should be estimated on thebasis of the best available information. The methods which may be used for thispurpose include those referred to in paragraph 42.AGRICULTURE57. Part I does not apply to agricultural enterprises engaged in the pro-duction and sale of unprocessed agricultural produce. Where such enterprisesengage in manufacturing or processing however, their prices are controlled by reference to allowable costs and net profit margins. Where they engage in distribution, their prices are controlled by reference to gross percentage marginsand net profit margins.NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES58. The provisions of the Code relating to prices will apply to the national-ised industries listed below as they apply to private sector undertakings exceptthat a nationalised industry in deficit will not be permitted to increase its prices by more than its allowable cost increases, as defined in paragraphs 16 to 18 and20 to 28, in order to reduce that deficit.National Coal board electricity CouncilArea Electricity BoardsCentral Electricity Generating board north of Scotland Hydro-Electric board south of Scotland Electricity board british Gas corporation british Steel corporation post office British Airways board british Airports authority british Railways board british Transport Docks board british Waterways board in the case of the National Coal Board and the British Steel Corporation,this is subject to what is said in paragraph 60, and in the case of the Post Officeand those industries concerned with air and sea transport, to the exclusion from control under paragraph 10(v) of charges for international traffic. The pricesof subsidiary companies of nationalised industries, including subsidiaries of theNational Bus Company, National Freight Corporation and the Scottish transport Group, are governed by paragraph 63(H).
59. As with a private sector enterprise trading at a loss, a nationalised industry in deficit will not be required to make a deduction in respect of pro-productivity improvements from allowable cost increases under paragraph 19.COAL AND STEEL60. Prices charged by producers for coal, coal-based solid fuels and moststeel products are outside the scope of the control by virtue of paragraph 10(ii).They are subject to international obligations through United Kingdom member-ship of the European Coal and Steel Community.(9) In any other cases pricesof steel products (including those of the private sector) are controlled likethose of other manufactured products. Prices of coal and steel merchants in theUnited Kingdom will be subject to the control of gross percentage marginsand net profit margins applied to wholesaling and retailing.61. Companies which produce both ECSC and non-ECSC iron and steel products will be subject to price control on the latter only. Where a non-ECSCproduct is made from an ECSC product, the lowest market price for the latter will be an allowable cost. For the purpose of calculating the limit on profit margins, only the profits from converting ECSC products into the final non-ECSC products will be relevant.OTHER PUBLIC SECTOR TRADING ENTERPRISES62. The Price Commission will apply to proposals for price increases which are referred to them by Government Departments engaged in sub-stantial trading operations the same principles as to proposals by the national-ised industries.63. The Code applies to the prices of the following enterprises, accordingto the nature of the business of the undertaking, as it applies to the prices ofprivate sector enterprises: (i) trading services of local authorities(10), local authority joint boards,public utility undertakings and other similar public sector undertakings(not being nationalised industries); and(ii) companies registered under the Companies Acts which are wholly or partly owned by Her Majesty&apos;s Government, or by a nationalised industry.WATER UNDERTAKINGS64. Water undertakings, whether public or private, are subject to statutorylimitations on deficits, on surpluses or profits, on profit distributions and onborrowing. Their water rates are already controlled to a large extent through these limitations. Subject to these statutory obligations, they will be required tocomply with the principles of the Code and in particular with the paragraphsrelating to allowable cost increases.C) and C10)- See Appendix
SERVICES65. In general, paragraphs 7 to 49 of the Code apply to the prices of service enterprises as they apply to those of manufacturers, so that the system ofallowable cost increases and the limitation on net profit margins per unit of sales or turnover apply to them. There will be an offset to allowable cost in-creases as a result of the abolition of Selective Employment Tax for service enterprises where this has hitherto been paid without refund. Paragraphs 29 to31 permit the Price Commission to calculate average allowable cost increases forcertain small service enterprises where the circumstances are appropriate.Paragraph 47 permits certain service enterprises with low profits to calculatetheir reference level for the limit on net profit margins by reference to turnoverrather than to capital employed (1 per cent on turnover rather than 5 per cent on capital). The following paragraphs deal with the application of the Code tosome particular service sectors, and explain any modifications of the general principles which apply to them.BANKING66. Subject to paragraph 10, all charges by banking enterprises other thaninterest rates are within the control and the system of allowable cost increases and the limitation on net profit margins apply to them.CONSTRUCTION67. In general, the Code applies to prices of construction enterprises as tothose of manufacturing enterprises. In particular the requirements of the Coderelating to allowable cost increases and the limitation on net profit marginsapply as appropriate to: (i) prices quoted in competitive and non-competitive tenders. Paragraph24 may however apply;(ii) variation of price clauses in construction contracts. Revision of pricesunder such clauses will be governed by the Code.TRANSPORT68. The Code applies to transport undertakings as it does to other service enterprises. Charges for international freight and passenger traffic are outsidethe control under paragraph 10(v). Charges of nationalised transport under-takings, passenger transport authorities, local authority transport undertakings and transport companies owned by nationalised industries are governed byparagraphs 58 to 59 and 63.69. Charges of private road haulage undertakings are subject to the pro-visions relating to allowable costs and to the limitation on net profit margins.HOTELS AND CATERING ENTERPRISES70. What is said in paragraph 65 applies to these enterprises also, in respectboth of charges for food and drink and for accommodation.*See also Section 4, paragraph 139
PROFESSIONAL SERVICES71. Fees and charges for professional services by firms or by individuals whoare self-employed are governed as prices by Part I. In general, what is said inparagraph 65 applies to them. The pay of professional staff who are employeesis however governed by Part II, as is the remuneration from public funds of doctors and dentists.72. Where scales or rates of charges of general application are in use in aprofession under instructions or advice issued by a professional association orother representative organisation, those scales or rates must be treated as maximaand may not be increased without the agreement of the Price Commission. TheCommission will apply the provisions relating to allowable cost increases tothose scales or rates, and the limitation on net profit margins to those who use them.MEMBERSHIP ORGANISATIONS73.  Subscriptions charged by organisations which: (i) exist for charitable or recreational purposes; and(ii) are non-profit making; and(iii) do not carry on a trade or business as their main activitywill not be controlled.74. Prices charged in any trading activity carried on by an organisation which meets the requirements of paragraph 73 are governed by the Code, unlessthe customers of the trading activity are confined to members of the organisation.
PART H: pay general Principles75.  The general principles relating to pay are: (i) to limit the rate of increase in pay in money terms to a level more in line with the growth of national output, so as progressively to reduce the rateof price inflation and improve the prospects of sustained faster growth in real earnings;(ii) to apply the limit fairly, irrespective of the form of any increase or themethod of determining it;(iii) to facilitate an improvement in the relative position of the low paid;(iv) to leave to those who normally determine pay decisions on the amount,form and distribution of increases within the limit.76. For all these purposes &quot;pay&quot; has the meaning given to it in paragraphs77 &amp; 79.Field of Application77. Part II of this section applies to all employment incomes (except self-employment incomes covered by Part I) whether determined at national, local,plant or any other level; and whether determined by collective bargaining, by arbitration, by statutory wage fixing bodies, or without collective agreement.It applies to all types of employment, to all wages and salaries at whateverlevel, including allowances, payments by results, payments in kind and lumpsums, and to both full-time and part-time employees in whatever size of under-taking.78. All concerned with the determination of employment incomes shouldtake into account the provisions of the Code.79. With certain limited exceptions specified below, improvements interms and conditions of employment other than pay must be costed and takeninto account in determining whether the pay limit is exceeded. References topay throughout this section are therefore to be taken to refer to remuneration inemployment and to include references to other terms and conditions of employ-ment with the exceptions specified.80. References throughout this Section to settlements are to be taken as including references to the determination by any method of any employmentincome.81. Where reference is made in this Section to a group, the group will normally be the same as that used for the purpose of pay decisions in thepreceding 12 months. It will, however, remain open to those concerned withparticular negotiations to vary the groups which are to be used as the basis of pay determination. Where pay is fixed on an individual basis, the provisionsapply to the individual as they would to a group.Intervals Between Increases82. No group may receive an increase in pay under a settlement made after November 1972 less than twelve months after the group last received anincrease unless: (i) an earlier date for such an increase was specified (other than by referenceto changes in indices or rates of pay for other groups) in a settlementmade before 6 November 1972; or(ii) the last increase was deferred as a result of the standstill under Cmnd
5125, in which case the 12 months counts from the date from which thelast increase would otherwise have operated.Where the last increase was one which does not count against the pay limit,the twelve months counts from the operative date of the last principal increase.The Pay Limit83. The pay limit is  1 per week per head, plus 4 per cent of the averagepay bill per head of the group for the twelve months immediately preceding the operative date of the first pay settlement after 6 November 1972.84. During the twelve months beginning with the operative date of thefirst pay settlement reached for any group after 6 November 1972, the total of increases in pay for that group shall not exceed the pay limit described inparagraph 83.85. Subject to the individual limit in paragraph 94, it will be for negotiatorsand others concerned with pay determination to decide on the amount anddistribution of increases within the pay limit, and on the division betweenincreases in wages or salaries and improvements in other conditions of service.They should, however, have full regard to the objective of improving therelative position of the low paid.86. In calculating the average pay bill per head the effect of absences from work due to absenteeism, sickness, short-time working or to stoppages fromany other cause should be excluded.87. Employers&apos; national insurance contributions, selective employment tax, the cost of pension schemes and redundancy payments and (subject to paragraph 91) the cost of overtime should be excluded from the pay bill andwill not count against the pay limit for the group.88. Part-time workers should be counted for the pay bill according to theproportion which their hours bear to the standard hours of the group.89. For any group where average weekly earnings do not vary (except as a result of absences from work), the pay limit can be calculated by adding4 per cent plus  la week to average weekly earnings per head. Where rates of pay represent earnings, the calculation can be done by adding the 4 per centplus  1 a week to the rates.90. Whether this method or any other is used to calculate a pay increase,it must produce a result which does not exceed the pay limit in paragraph 83.It will be the responsibility of those concerned with settling pay to satisfy the pay Board, if required, that the method used does produce this result.Overtime, Shift. Rest Day and Weekend Working91. Payment for hours which are normal working hours within the meaning of Schedule 2 to the Contracts of Employment Act, 1972(n) should be includedin the pay bill for the purpose of calculating the pay limit and the effect on such payments of any improvement in pay will count against the pay limit and the effecton such payments of any improvement in pay will count against the pay limit.92. If there is any widening of the existing percentage differential betweenrates of pay for overtime, shift, rest day and weekend working and the effectiverate of pay for standard hours (for example if the overtime multiplier is increased from time and a third to time and a half), the additional cost will count in fullagainst the pay limit. The cost must be calculated on the assumption that theamount of such working in the twelve months from the operative date of theC11) See Appendix.
settlement will be at least as much as in the preceding twelve months.93. Subject to paragraphs 91 and 92, the cost of hours actually workedoutside normal working hours should be excluded from the pay bill in calcul-ating the pay limit. Any increase in the cost of such working will not count against the pay limit.Individual pay limit94. Increases subject to the pay limit must not exceed  250 a year for any individual. If the individual works part time this limit must be reduced accordingto the proportion his hours bear to standard hours of the group. increases which are not subject to the pay limit (for example increases in this categoryarising from overtime or certain personal increments) do not count against the 250 limit.Other improvements in pay and conditionsEqual pay95. Orderly progress towards achievement of the requirements of theEqual Pay Act 1970 may be made outside the pay limit on the basis set out below.96. Subject to paragraph 97 an increase for this purpose is outside the pay limit to the extent that, by the end of 1973, it reduces by up to one third anydifferential between men&apos;s and women&apos;s rates which existed at 31 December1972 and which is required by the Equal Pay Act to be eliminated by 29December 1975. Any increase in excess of this counts against the pay limit.97.  No increase outside the pay limit is allowable under paragraph 96if any other increase affecting the group concerned has the effect of wideningthe percentage difference between men&apos;s and women&apos;s rates in question.Hours98. Reductions in standard working hours may be made outside the pay limit if they reduce standard working hours to not less than 40 hours a week,net of meal breaks.99. Reductions in standard working hours other than as provided for inparagraph 98 count against the pay limit. The true cost should be set againstthe pay limit but the cost should not be treated as less than proportional to thereduction (so that for example a reduction of one hour in 40 should be treatedas equivalent to a 2i per cent increase in pay), except with the approval of the pay Board.Holidays100. Improvements in holidays do not count against the pay limit unless they increase the total holidays for any group to more than the equivalent of3 weeks a year excluding: (i) up to six occasional or public holidays;(ii) rest days taken in lieu of weekends or overtime; and(iii) rest days granted before 6 November 1972 in lieu of a shorter working week.101.  Improvements in holidays other than as provided for in paragraph100 count against the pay limit on the basis of their true cost.Personal Increments102.  Where personal increments(i) are part of a well established system of annual increments* based on*Systems which meet the requirements of this paragraph are not limited to those whererates of pay are expressed as a predetermined range or scale.
merit, age or seniority which was in force before 6 November 1972 and(ii) do not exceed those paid in similar circumstances in previous years,any net addition to the annual pay bill per head for the group concerned willnot count against the pay limit. Personal increments paid on this basis do not count against the limit of  250 a year for the individual concerned.103. The following count against the pay limit and against the individuallimit of  250:-(i) Any net addition to the annual pay bill of a group resulting from thepayment of types of personal increment other than those in paragraph102; and(ii) any element in personal increments which relates to factors not personalto the individual concerned, such as cost of living increases or companyprofits (other than under a profit sharing scheme as it existed before November 1972).Promotion and Regrading104. In cases of individual promotion or regrading, an increase commen-commensurate with greater responsibility or greater effort may be given outside the pay limit. Where this test is not satisfied any increase in pay counts against the pay limit. The cost of any general regrading scheme will count against the pay limit.Artificial regrading and changes of job specification should not be used as a means of avoiding the provisions of the Code.New Employees and New Work105. New recruits to existing jobs should not be paid more than thosethey replace or more than the rate paid currently by the employer concerned forthe same job.106. The rate for new work should not be more than the current rate paidin the locality for the same or most nearly similar work by the same or other employers.Recognised Terms and Conditions107. The cost of increases to meet the purposes of Section 8 of the terms and Conditions of Employment Act, 1959,(12) the Road Haulage Wages Act,1938 and similar legislation, and the Fair Wages Resolution of 1946 will not count against the pay limit.Pensions108. New or improved benefits under tax-approved occupational pension schemes and any reimbursement of a corresponding increase in employeecontributions may, unless paragraph 109 applies, be given outside the pay limit.109. Where a change in a pension scheme has the effect of increasing the pay, net of any pension contribution, of a substantial proportion of the group of employees covered by the scheme, that increase counts against the pay limit(13)unless: (i) a revaluation of the scheme has shown a surplus in respect of thosereceiving the increase, the value of which equals or exceeds the increase;or(ii) there has been a corresponding reduction in benefits to those receiving the increase; or(iii) the change had been proposed before 6 November 1972.(ia) See Appendix.(13) See Appendix.
Redundancy Payments110. New or improved benefits under schemes for payments to workers who leave an employees service because of redundancy are outside the pay limit, as are benefits under schemes providing income during long-term incapacity.Profit-sharing Schemes111. Payments under the terms of profit-sharing schemes as they stoodbefore 6 November 1972 will not count against the pay limit. Any other pay-ments or benefits under such schemes must be counted against the pay limit.Share Option and Share Incentive Schemes112. No new options may be granted under share option schemes or newshares issued under share incentive schemes and no new schemes may be implemented.Other Benefits113. All improvements in terms and conditions of service count against the pay limit, unless specifically exempted in the Code. In addition to those already mentioned the following are examples of benefits which count against the pay limit if they are introduced, extended in scope or otherwise improved: Benefits in cash or kind, including the provision of cars partly or whollyfor private use, living accommodation at less than economic cost, etc.Loans at below market rate, e.g. for house purchaseLunch or other meal vouchersSeasonal bonusesResponsibility allowancesShift payNight duty allowancesLondon allowance or other geographical allowanceStand-by paymentsLay off and sick pay114.   Reimbursement of expenses incurred in the course of the job (includingremoval expenses) does not count against the pay limit.Particular Methods and Systems of PaymentNational, Local and Plant Increases115. Where settlements or pay determinations for a particular group are concluded at more than one level (for example a settlement at national or industry level is supplemented by settlements at local or plant level) the total increase for the group for the twelve months beginning with the first increase which counts against the pay limit should be kept within that limit. Paragraph82 applies separately to each level of settlement.116. In arriving at the amount available for local or plant increases, thosenegotiating locally or at plant level should count against the pay limit increases under any national settlement from which the group benefit. Where nationalnegotiations are undertaken, increases already given or in prospect at local orplant level should be taken into account in arriving at the amount available for national increases.Payment by Results117. Increases in pay under schemes of payment by results, includingpiecework, will count against the pay limit except where they arise directlyform increased output. This applies to increased payments arising from changesin base rate, conversion rate or other calculator, piecework prices or times, the
fixed element or from any other change in the terms.118. For those covered by schemes of payment by results the twelve month period referred to in paragraph 84 will be the twelve months following the endof the standstill.119.  Where there are both: -(i) payments by results and(ii) a general increase operative after 6 November 1972 for the same group,account must be taken, in calculating the amount available for the general increase, of any increase under (i) which counts against the pay limit. For thispurpose it must be assumed that the percentage increase in pay arising under (i)during the twelve months following the end of the standstill will be at least as great as in the preceding twelve months.Productivity and Restructuring Schemes120. Except as in paragraph 121, increases in pay under productivity orrestructuring schemes introduced after 6 November 1972 count against the pay limit.121.  Where:(i) there was on 6 November an agreement to implement a programme of productivity schemes, or a restructuring, for specified groups of em-ployees in which the amount of pay or the precise method by which itwas to be calculated was clearly specified, leaving only the practicaldetails of application of the scheme to particular groups to be settled;and(ii) the employer or group of employers covered by the agreement had on6 November already implemented the programme in respect of some ofthe employees concerned,implementation of the programme in respect of the remainder of the specifiedgroups may proceed. The resultant increases in pay will not count against the pay limit.Settlements Reached Before the Standstill122. Subject to the requirements of paragraphs 13-17 of Cmnd 5125 andparagraphs 35 &amp; 36 of Cmnd 5205, settlements reached on or before November 1972 which provide for specified increases on specified dates (and do so not merely by reference to changes in indices or other rates of pay) maybe implemented in full and from their due date.123. The cost of such increases will count against the pay limit. Where thecost equals or exceeds the pay limit, no further increase of a kind which countsagainst the pay limit may be paid to the group during the following twelvemonths.New long-term agreements124. Settlements may be made providing for staged increases at not less than twelve month intervals which are consistent with the Code but implementation of the later stages will be subject to the provisions of the Code at the time.PART III: GENERAL125. Where the Code cannot be directly applied to particular cases orsectors without modification, the Price Commission and the Pay Board will,in exercising their powers, apply the Code with such adaptations or modifications as appear to them to be necessary to give effect to its principles and objectives.
SECTION 3DividendsAdministration and General Principles126. Dividend control will continue to be administered by the Treasury.However, the Counter-Inflation Bill makes it possible for one of the Agencies toplay a part in the administration of dividend restraint if this should be thoughtappropriate at some future date and permits questions relating to dividends tobe referred to the appropriate Agency.127. It is intended that the control of dividends should, as in the presentstandstill, operate on declarations; however the Bill also gives power to controlpayments of dividends should this be necessary. Except as indicated in thefollowing paragraph, companies incorporated in the United Kingdom will notbe permitted, without the consent of the Treasury, to declare dividends for anycompany account year which exceed by more than 5 per cent the amount of ordinary dividends declared by the company for the preceding company accountyear. Other analogous distributions out of the assets of a company are prohibited,except with the consent of the Treasury. Since they cannot be increased, fixedrate dividends are, however, not subject to control.Field of Application128. Dividend control applies to all companies incorporated in the UnitedKingdom with the exception of: (a) investment trusts as defined in Section 359 of the Income and CorporationTaxes Act 1970;(6) close companies to the extent that they increase distributions in order tocomply with the special tax rules concerning such companies;(c) companies entirely in the beneficial ownership of another company or companies (except those in the ownership or part ownership of an investment trust) where ordinary dividend payments are exclusivelyinter-company transcations.129.  Effect will be given to the control for quoted companies by making anorder after Royal Assent applying the relevant provisions of the Bill to suchcompanies, except where they are in the categories mentioned above. The orderwill specify in detail the coverage of the control, the basis of comparison forpurposes of calculation and other relevant factors.130. Companies other than quoted companies will not be covered by theorder. They will nevertheless be subject to the same limitations on dividenddeclarations as quoted companies and will be expected to comply with them.The restrictions may be applied to individual unquoted companies by means ofa notice.The Dividend Limit131. In computing what dividends may be declared for a company&apos;s accountyear, the starting point will be the total amount of ordinary dividends declaredfor the last account year in respect of which a profit and loss account of thecompany laid before it in general meeting was compiled. The money amount ofthese dividends may then be increased by 5 per cent to give the total amount ofthe ordinary dividends which may be declared for the succeeding companyaccount year.132. In the case of dividends to be paid after 5 April 1973, the basis of comparison will need to take account of the changes in corporation tax which
will come into operation on that date. The comparison will be between: (a) gross dividends paid before 6 April 1973; and(b) franked payments (that is the aggregate of dividends and the relevantadvance corporation tax payable thereon) made after 5 April 1973.The 5 per cent increase applies to the amount of the gross dividend declaredfor the company&apos;s preceding account year.133. Pro rata adjustments should also be made (i) to take account of changes of more than one month in the length of a company&apos;s accountingperiod; and (ii) where there has been a reduction in the company&apos;s share capital, or where a company&apos;s share capital has increased since the precedingaccount year and the increase reflects the value of new cash subscribed or otherreal consideration. A company may make a normal capitalisation issue, cut anincrease in capital which is the result of a capitalisation issue will not rank forincreased dividend.Application to Takeovers, New Companies etc.134. The legislation will empower the Treasury or one of the Agencies toissue consents to allow companies to declare dividends which are greater thanthe normally permitted level. Such consents will only be granted in exceptional circumstances, and any application for such treatment must be made in writingwell before any relevant board meeting.135. It is not possible to specify in advance precise rules applicable to allcases. The following however indicates the way in which the control will operate in particular circumstances:-Takeover DefenceWhere the Treasury are satisfied that an actual bid situation exists,companies wishing to defend themselves from the bidder by increasing their dividends will normally be allowed to do so.New CompaniesNew companies fall into two main categories: those formed by thereconstruction or amalgamation of existing companies, and others.The former category will normally be allowed to declare dividends notexceeding the aggregate of the dividends declared in the preceedingaccount years by the parties to the merger, plus 5 per cent. The control will not apply in respect of their first account year to dividends declared by completely new companies, or by former private or unquoted publiccompanies coming to the market for the first time.RecoveriesCompanies which have recovered from an adverse trading position will normally be permitted to increase their dividends to the level of an earlier more typical year. They will not, however, be allowed the 5 percent increase on top of this concession.Pre-Standstill CommitmentsSome companies may have issued formal documents to investors (forexample, prospectuses or rights issue offer documents) before the PrimeMinisters announcement of dividend restraint on 6 November 1972in which they made statements of intent about future dividend declara-tions. Provided the Treasury are satisfied that a real commitment existsand that it was relevant to the actions of the people to whom the prospective-
tuses were addressed, it is the intention to allow such commitments to behonoured.SECTION 4Machinery and ProcedureSpecial arrangementsFood136. Section 2 of this Consultative Document makes it clear that prices of manufactured food will be controlled, both directly and through the profit margins of the manufacturers; and that the prices charged by wholesalers and retailers for all food, whether fresh or manufactured, will be controlled through their gross margins and profit margins.137. A special panel of the Price Commission will be set up to deal with prices of food and drink. This panel will carry out the Commission^ functions in relation to the prices of semi-processed and manufactured foods, which willbe controlled in the same way as manufactured products generally. TheCommission will also be able to carry out special inquiries into the circumstances affecting the price of any fresh food.Construction138. The construction industry is not only of great importance to the economy but also has special features which call for a different approach in theapplication of counter-inflation policy to both prices and pay from that which applies to most other industries. Thus on prices most construction work takes place on the basis of competitive tenders. Similarly the application of the paypolicy must take account of the extent of site bargaining and labour-onlysubcontracting as well as the large amount of self-employment in the industry.The Government propose that a special Construction Panel should be establishedwhich would include members of both the Price Commission and Pay Board.This panel would examine these issues and make recommendations for actionto the Commission and the Board, and if necessary to the Government. TheGovernment would be glad to discuss the possibility of representations of bothsides of industry on this panel.Notification, reporting and record keeping: prices139. There will be three different procedures for ensuring that the pricespolicy is effectively monitored and implemented: prior notification of proposedprice increases to the Price Commission, regular reporting to the Commission,and record keeping subject to spot checks by the Commission. These corresponds to the requirements for manufacturing companies in Categories I-III set out inparagraphs 6-8 of the Appendix to Cmnd 5205.(15) The class of enterprisewhich the Government propose should be subject to each procedure will varyin different sectors, because of their different characteristics. The notificationand reporting requirements will be embodied in orders made under the Counter-Inflation Bill when it becomes law.140. The requirements for enterprises in different sectors will normally be defined in terms of the value of sales in the domestic market during their lastfinancial year ending not later than 31 December 1972. The proposed definitionsare summarised in the table below.(&apos;5) See Appendix.
Priornotificationand reportingReportingRecord-keeping  million  million  millionManufacturing,      mining,public utilities and publicpassenger transportWholesalers and retailers ..Services     ......ConstructionProfessional Servicesover 20over 505-50over 105-20over 101-50.25-100.25-51-10National scalesor ratesover 0.250.1-0.25Notification141. The Counter-Inflation Bill provides that the Price Commission shouldgenerally be notified, with full supporting data, 8 weeks in advance of the date on which the proposed price increase would come into effect. If no reply is received within 28 days of the receipt of the application the Price commission will be deemed to have consented to the increase. If the Price Commission is unable to complete its examination within 28 days it may, before the expiry ofthat period, inform the applicant that the application is still under consideration.The Commission must give a decision within a further 14 days (that is, 42 days from the date of the application).142. The Price Commission will deal with all notifications as speedily aspossible. Where, because of the nature of a product (e.g. a processed food heavily dependent on raw materials which fluctuate in price), it is important that adecision is given in less than 28 days, every effort will be made to do so and itwill be open to the Price Commission to make special arrangements for such products.143. Certain enterprises whose sales in the domestic market are below thefigures in the second column of the table above, but which have a relativelylarge share, or are of special importance, in the market for particular goods willbe required to pre-notify.144. Mixed enterprises (that is, those engaged in wholesale, retail or serviceoperations as well as manufacturing) will be required to pre-notify price increases in their manufactured products where the sales of these products in the domestic market (including sales through their own wholesale or retail outlets) exceed 50 million. Service activities of mixed enterprises which exceed the limitsshown in the table are also required to pre-notify.145. Two exemptions from the requirement to pre-notify are proposed. Thefirst exempts price increases where: (i) part of the business of a major enterprise is a subsidiary activity of adifferent character from the main business; and(ii) the value of home sales of the product or service provided in the lastcompany account year was less than  1 million and the total salescovered by the exemptions do not exceed 5 per cent by value of the totaldomestic sales of the enterprise.146. Secondly, where an enterprise receives consent from the Price Corn-mission to an increase in the price of a material which it produces, it shall notbe required to pre-notify subsequently price increases of products incorporatingthis material, in so far as these price increases are wholly consequential on the approved increases in the price of the material.
Reporting147. All notifying and reporting enterprises will be required to submit tothe Price Commission within 3 weeks after the end of each quarter reports ontheir costs, prices, sales and profits. Where audited financial accounts are notavailable, figures derived from management accounts may be used providedthat these can in due course be reconciled with audited financial accounts.Initially they will also be required to submit accounts for the previous 2 years,including audited accounts for the latest year, and quarterly data for that year or a later period, as convenient to each company. They should in additionprovide sufficient information to establish the reference level for the profit margin limit.148. The precise form of these reports will be a matter for consultation butthey will be simple and the aim will be, wherever possible, to avoid askingcompanies to produce data which they do not need for their own purposes.Record Keeping149. Those required to keep records need only submit them to the price commission on request.Construction150. Prices tendered for construction services will not be subject to priceapproval by the Price Commission. Construction firms with a turnover of morethan  10 million a year will be required to submit to the Commission reports oftheir costs, prices, turnover and profits at 3 monthly intervals. Firms with aturnover of between  1 million and  10 million a year will be required tomaintain adequate records of their costs, prices and profits and to make themavailable to the Commission if called upon to do so.151. Firms engaged on or receiving contracts for construction services which are worth individually more than  5 million, and which include clausesproviding for variation of prices, will be required to provide the commission with an outline description of the work, the form of contract in use, the items to which variation of price applies, and where applicable the amount of moneyreceived in payments under the variation of prices provisions during the last three months.Notification, Reporting and Record Keeping: Pay152. Cmnd 5205 set out, as a basis for consultation, what was in effect a4-tier system:(i) settlements affecting 500 or more employees to be notified to the pay board in advance;(ii) settlements down to an unspecified lower limit to be notified whenimplemented;(iii) &quot;all but the smallest firms&quot; to keep records;(iv) the smallest firms to be exempt even from record-keeping.Pre-Notification153. The Government propose that settlements affecting 500 or moreemployees (whether or not in one firm) should be subject to pre-notification.They should not be implemented until either the Pay Board gives its approvalor 8 weeks have elapsed. The suggested figure, however, is subject to review inthe light of the present voluntary notification arrangements. The method of pre-notification is dealt with in paragraphs 157 and 158 below.
Notification of Settlements after Implementation154. The proposed requirement is that settlements affecting 100 to 500employees should be notified after implementation. The Government also propose that periodic returns should be made to the Pay Board of increases in earnings resulting from payment by results schemes where these relate tosignificant numbers of employees. This information will enable the Board tocarry out sample checks and to examine cases of strategic importance to thepolicy; it will also provide a basis for quarterly reports by the Pay Board on thegeneral progress of the policy.Construction155. The Government intend to have further consultations with the con-struction industry about the need for special additional arrangements fornotification of pay on large construction sites.Record Keeping156. Firms with more than 10 employees should keep records showing thenumbers of employees, pay bill, pay increases, dates of implementation and theeffect on the pay bill. They should retain these records for at least 12 months.Method of Pre-Notification157. The Bill envisages that settlements may need to be notified to the pay board 8 weeks before implementation. The Board will of course give earlierdecisions wherever possible, but it may be necessary to allow for some of the settlements approved by the Board to be backdated.158. To facilitate early decisions on notified settlements the Pay Board will need to be informed of major negotiations in progress.Statutory Determination of Pay or Prices159. Statutory bodies which determine pay or prices will be required to haveregard to the Code.(16) Their statutory obligations must be modified accordingly.The appropriate provisions of the Counter Inflation Bill make it possible tomodify the relevant legislation as necessary.160. In the case of bus fares and domestic air fares the right of appeal to theSecretary of State against a decision of the Traffic Commissioners and the CivilAviation Authority respectively will remain, but in determining any appealsthe Secretary of State will have regard to the Code and may consult the price commission. Rights of appeal to the National Ports Council against ship,passenger and goods dues will also be retained. In determining appeals it isintended that the National Ports Council should have regard to the Code.161. The Government will apply the Code to pay settlements with which itis concerned, and will arrange notification of settlements to which it is a partyto the Pay Board. The treatment of prices and charges by nationalised industries and by Government Departments engaged in substantial trading operations hasalready been explained in Section 2. In relation to other prices and charges forwhich it has responsibility, the Government intend to follow the principles ofthe Code. In many important cases however the Government is already holdingcharges below the levels which the Code would permit.(&quot;) See Appendix.
The following explanatory notes may be of assistance to those using the consultative document. The numbers quoted correspond to those inserted in the text.(l)-paragraph 10(vi)Prices of drugs (&quot;ethical medicines&quot;) wholly or mainly purchased for use in theNational Health Service are regulated by agreement between the Secretary of State for social Services and the manufacturers. This system is effective, and it is proposed thatthe prices of these medicines should continue to be regulated through this agreement,rather than the Code, so long as the agreement remains in force.(2)-paragraph 10(yii)Insurance premiums are to be controlled by the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry rather than through the Code. The Government will propose an amendment to the Counter-inflation Bill to give the Secretary of State these powers.

It would not be satis-factory to separate responsibility for controlling the level of premiums from responsi-bility for the companies&apos; solvency.(3)-paragraph 12The fresh foods and other similar products referred to in paragraph 12 are the products of agriculture, horticulture or fishing which have not been processed orincorporated in any processed product.(4)-paragraph 13The retail price of milk for liquid consumption is controlled under the Milk (GreatBritain) Order 1971 and the Milk (Northern Ireland) Order 1971.(5) paragraph 77(030 September 1972 has been adopted because it was the end of the last completequarter before the standstill.(6)-paragraph 17(0)Labour costs include: (i) wages and salaries;(ii) national insurance contributions;(iii) payments to pension funds;(iv) payments in respect of redundancy;(v) training costs.(7)-paragraph 42(H)Calculation of purchase tax element in total sales.1.   Goods may be divided into four categories: (a) chargeable to purchase tax at 25 per cent(b) chargeable at 18 per cent(c) chargeable at 11.25 per cent(d) not chargeable2. Where annual purchases of goods can be satisfactorily distributed between thefour categories, the total purchase tax paid in respect of previous years&apos; sales at thecurrent rate of tax may be calculated as follows. Purchase tax as a proportion of the tax-inclusive cost of stocks, can be found for each category by reference to the following factors. These factors corresponding retrospectively to the four tax categories, are20 per cent, 15.3 per cent, 9.9 per cent and nil. On the basis of annual purchases of goodsin each category the overall purchase tax element in purchases can be estimated. Theestimated figure can then be deducted from total sales to arrive at turnover net of purchase tax.3. In respect of the period between 19 July 1971 and 21 March 1972 goods nowchargeable at 25 per cent were charged at 30 or 45 per cent of the tax-exclusive whole-sale price. The tax element for category (a) goods should be increased by one-fifth in

Goods may be divided into four categories: (a) chargeable to purchase tax at 25 per cent(b) chargeable at 18 per cent(c) chargeable at 11.25 per cent(d) not chargeable2. Where annual purchases of goods can be satisfactorily distributed between thefour categories, the total purchase tax paid in respect of previous years&apos; sales at thecurrent rate of tax may be calculated as follows. Purchase tax as a proportion of the tax-inclusive cost of stocks, can be found for each category by reference to the following factors. These factors corresponding retrospectively to the four tax categories, are20 per cent, 15.3 per cent, 9.9 per cent and nil. On the basis of annual purchases of goodsin each category the overall purchase tax element in purchases can be estimated. Theestimated figure can then be deducted from total sales to arrive at turnover net of purchase tax.3. In respect of the period between 19 July 1971 and 21 March 1972 goods nowchargeable at 25 per cent were charged at 30 or 45 per cent of the tax-exclusive whole-sale price. The tax element for category (a) goods should be increased by one-fifth in
respect of goods chargeable at the 30 per cent rate and four-fifths in respect of thosecharged at the 45 per cent rate. Aggregate purchase tax elements established for therates prevailing between July 1971 and March 1972 should be increased by two-ninthsfor all periods before July 1971, notwithstanding changes in tax rates and coveragebefore May 1969.(8) paragraph 47The services listed in Sections XXIV to XXVI of the Standard Industrial Classi-hcation include : XXIVBanking and bill-discountingOther financial institutions(eg stockbrokers and jobbers, investment companies, unit and investmenttrusts, building societies etc)Property owning and managing, etcAdvertising and market researchOther business servicesCentral offices not allocable elsewhereXXVAccountancy servicesEducational servicesLegal servicesMedical and dental servicesResearch and development services other professional and scientific services(eg architects, surveyors, actuaries, veterinary surgeons, artists, authors etc)XXVICinemas, theatres, radio etcSport and other recreationsBetting and gamblingHotels and other residential establishmentsRestaurants, cafes, snack barsPublic housesClubsCatering contractorsHair dressingLaundriesDry cleaningMotor repairers, distributors, garages and filling stationsRepair of boots and shoes(9)-paragraph 60The products subject to the rules of the European Coal and Steel Community, andtherefore outside the scope of the Code, are those listed in Annex 1 of the Treaty of paris.(10)-paragraph 65(0&quot;Trading services of local authorities&quot; excludes Housing Revenue Accounts.(1 l)-paragraph 91Normal working hours within Schedule 2 of the Contracts of Employment Act, 1972include any hours paid at overtime rates which the employee is required to work underthe terms of his contract.(12) paragraph 107The legislation referred to in this paragraph gives to individual employees or groups of employees within a trade or industry, or to those representing them, a right to seekimprovements in their conditions to bring them into line with conditions in that trade or industry generally or with Wages Council rates. The Fair Wages Resolution of
1946 relates to Government contracts. A clause in Government contracts providesthat those contracting with the Government will give to those employed on the workto which the contract relates wages which are fair for the trade or industry concerned and are not less than those generally paid in that trade. The effect of paragraph 107is to allow improvements for individuals or small groups under any of these provisionsoutside the pay limit.(13) paragraph 109Improvements in benefits under occupational pension schemes may be made outsidethe pay limit, even if there is no extra employee contribution for them. If the employeecontribution is increased (eg because of an increase in benefits) but the employerincreases pay to offset all or part of the contribution increase, there is still no charge against the pay limit. But if pay net of the employee&apos;s contribution is increased so thatthere is in effect an increase in take-home pay (as a result, for instance, of turning a contributory scheme into a non-contributory one), then there is a charge on the pay limit unless one of the conditions in paragraph 109 is met. The principle is that increases in benefits are outside the limit, but increases in net pay are not.(14) Paragraph 122The relevant paragraphs of Cmnd. 5125 and 5205 are as follows: Cmnd. 5125Existing agreements13. In all cases where a settlement was reached before the stand-still, and the operative date of the increase was on or before 6 November, the increase can be implemented.14. However, there will be some agreements made before the standstill which provide for specified increases in pay or improvements in other conditions to take effect from an operative date falling within the period of the standstill. The operative date of such increases will be deferred until the standstill comes to an end. Includedin this category are any increases which may fall due during the standstill under existingcost of living sliding scale arrangements.Wages Councils and Boards15. Proposals from Wages Councils and Boards made on or before 6 Novembermay be implemented if the operative date of the last increase was at least 12 months before the standstill.Arbitration awards16. Arbitration awards may be implemented during the standstill if the relevanthearings were completed on or before 6 November and the operative date was not later than that date.Deferred increases17. Apart from the cases in paragraphs 13, 15, and 16 above, where payment is permitted during the standstill, the implementation of pay increases or improvements in conditions negotiated or submitted to arbitration before the standstill is deferred until the end of the standstill.Cmnd. 5205 (Appendix)Settlements deferred by the standstill35. Settlements and other increases (such as personal increments) which were dueto be implemented before the 90 day standstill, ie before 30 November 1972, may take effect from 28 February. Thereafter, increases which have been deferred may be imple-mented 90 days after their due date or at the end of the standstill if that is earlier.In both cases this is subject to the due date being not less than 12 months after theprevious settlement.
36. Subject to the above provisions on timing, settlements deferred during the standstill which were reached on or before 6 November 1972 will be allowed to take effect in full but without retrospection.(15) paragraph 139Paragraphs 6 to 8 of the Appendix to Cmnd. 5205 read as follows: Manufacturers6. For the purpose of control, all companies whose main activities are in manufactur-ing will be divided into three Categories. The largest firms (Category I) and other firms with a relatively large share of the market for particular goods, will be required to notify the Price Commission before increasing prices of goods they sell. The periodof notice will be specified in the Code after consultation. The Price Commission mayauthorise the increases requested or it may refuse consent. Unless the Price Commissionnotifies the applicant to the contrary within a time to be specified the proposed price increase may be implemented. Category I firms will also be required to submit to theCommission regular reports of their costs, prices and profit margins for scrutiny inconnection with the application of these arrangements.7. Medium-sized firms (Category II) will not be required to obtain consent beforeincreasing prices, but they will be required to submit regular reports of their costs,prices and profits to the Price Commission. The Commission will be empowered to investigate as it considers appropriate. If necessary, the Commission may require that prices should be reduced.8. Smaller firms (Category III) will also not be required to obtain prior agreement to increase prices, nor will they be required to submit returns to the Price Commission.But they will be subject to spot checks. All enterprises above a minimum size will haveto keep records in appropriate form, and may be required to justify price increases tothe Commission.9. The definition of the three Categories will be worked out urgently in consultationwith those concerned, but the Government envisage that all manufacturing companies with a turnover over  50 million a year will fall into Category I, though that Categorymay well need to go wider.(16)-paragraph 159The statutory authority for this requirement is, in the case of the Traffic Commission-ers, the Road Traffic Act 1960. For the Civil Aviation Authority it is the Civil AviationAct 1971.Printed in England for Her Maiesty&apos;s Stationery Office by Brown Knight &amp; Truscott Ltd. London.Dd. 158291 K800 2/73
