THE PRICE AND PAY CODEA CONSULTATIVE document.    This Consultative Document contains four sections.   It beginswith an explanation of the status of the Document and of the government&apos;s proposals for further discussion of the Code, inParliament and elsewhere, and for bringing it into operation.Section 2 contains the proposals for prices and pay which willlater be embodied in the Price and Pay Code, and Section 3 theproposals for the control of dividends, which will be administered by the Treasury.   Section k deals with arrangements for notification of price and pay information to the Price Commission and Pay Board,and with some other questions of organisation and procedure.   an appendix contains explanatory notes which may be helpful to thoseconsidering Section 2.   A detailed list of contents is as follows:SECTION 1:Status of Consultative DocumentSubsequent stepsSECTION 2:    A CODE FOR PRICES AND PAYPart I:        PricesGeneral principlesScope of controlAllowable costsRelationship of price increases to allowable cost increasesProfit marginsInvestmentApplication to particular sectorsPart II:      pay general principlesScope of controlIntervals between increases the pay limit

3SECTION 1Status of the Consultative Document2.     Clause 2 of the Counter Inflation Bill now beforeParliament requires the Treasury to prepare a Code to whichit will be the duty of the Price Commission and Pay Board to haveregard in performing their functions, and which is to includepractical guidance for those concerned in decisions on levels ofprices and pay.   The Bill also requires a wide-ranging process of consultation before a statutory instrument containing the Codeis made.3.    The White Paper published on 17 January*, which was fully debatedby Parliament, contained an Appendix which was a first outline ofthe Code.   This Consultative Document marks the next stage in thepreparation of the Code and provides a basis for the consultationsenvisaged in the Bill.   It takes account of suggestions already madeon the basis of the White Paper, as well as of experience in theadministration of the standstill.   Section 2 contains a considerableelaboration of the outline in the White Paper.   However it does notat this stage represent a definitive statement of the Government&apos;views.   It is likely to require amendment*A Programme for Controlling Inflation:   The Second Stage (Cmnd 5205)
confidential and elaboration in the light of consultation, of views expressed inParliament, and of further consideration by the Government./,.    The proposals for the administration of dividend control inSection 3 will not form a part of the Code.   The dividend control willbe administered by the Treasury and this Section described, as a basis for consultation, how it is proposed that should be done.   An order under Section 9 of the Bill will be made after Royal Assent to giveeffect to the dividend control.   The notification and reportingarrangements discussed in Section 4 will also require a separateorder or orders under Clause 5 or Clause 12 of the Bill, and willnot form part of the Code.   Here also however the Government w.i.sh to consult those concerned on the scope of the requirements and how theyare to be defined and proposals to serve as a basis for consultationare therefore included.Subsequent Steps5.    The Government propose to publish before the end of March a white Paper which takes account of consultations on this document and contains a complete draft of the Price and Pay Code.   Soon afterthe Counter Inflation Bill receives Royal Assent an order will bemade giving effect to the Code.   This will bring into operation thecontrol powers in Part II of the Bill, will enable the Price Commissionand Pay Board to exercise their powers unfler that part of the bill and will mark the end of the standstill on pay and on dividends:    the standstill on prices and rents will continue until 28 April.6.    The legislation requires that the order containing the Codeshould be approved by Parliament within a month after it is made.The Code will therefore come before Parliament for a fourth timein its final form when resolutions approving it are sought in each house.4-
CONFIDENTIALSECTION 2A CODE FOR PRICES AND pay*    This Code will have a dual function.   First, all those concerned with the determination of prices and pay are requiredto have regard to it.   Secondly, the Price Commission and pay board are required to exercise their powers so as to ensurethat the Code is implemented.8.    The Code is therefore addressed both to all those concerned with price and pay determination, and to the Agencies.Its terms reflect this.   It deals in Fart I with prices and inPart II with pay.5
CONFIDENTIALPART I:    PRICESGeneral Principles9.     The general principles relating to prices are:-(i)   to limit the extent to which prices may be increased on account of increased costs, and to secure reductionsas a result of reduced costs.(ii)   to reinforce the control of prices by limiting profit margins per unit of output so that there is not anunjustified addition to the price level.(iii)   in all these respects to reinforce the effects of competition, and to secure the full benefits of competition in the price level, while safeguarding investment.Scope of Control10.   With the exceptions specified in paragraphs 1$ and 14 below, theprices of goods and services supplied to the United Kingdom home market are within the scope of the control.11.   The prices of goods and services exported are not controlled.12.   The following are not controlled:-(i)   Prices paid to overseas suppliers for imports,(ii)   Prices of goods and services where the application ofthe control would be inconsistent with an international agreement or arrangement.   For this purpose, an inter-national agreement or arrangement is one between states or organisations of States, not between firms.6
7(iii)   Prices paid to producers for fresh food and other primary products of animal or vegetable origin subject tofluctuations from seasonal causes or causes external tothe United Kingdom.   This exclusion does not apply tofossil fuels or to minerals.(iv)   Prices at sales by auction, including sales by tender.(v)   Charges for international freight and passenger traffic.This exclusion applies to charges for air navigation and landing services and to ship, passenger and goods dues,provided in each case that they relate wholly or mainly tosuch traffic.    It applies also to international mail andtelecommunication charges.   It does not apply however to charges relating wholly to domestic air or sea journeys, orto charges for coastal sea traffic.(vi)   Prices of ethical medicines supplied to the United kingdom market to the extent that regulation of their prices is within the scope of any agreement relating to those pricesmade between the Secretary of State and representatives of manufacturers of those medicines; but only so long as such agreement is in force,(vii)   Insurance premiums.13.   References in this Code to prices include references to charges,unless there is explicit provision to the contrary.
8Allowable Cost Increases14.   Enterprises may not increase prices in the domestic market,except to reflect increases in allowable costs per unit of output.Where they increase prices on these grounds they should do so without any increase in profit margins as a proportion of salesand within the limitations in the following paragraphs.   price reductions     should be made to reflect fully any fall in the costs per unit of output of an enterprise which has taken place since the last price change.15*   Subject to the following paragraphs, a cost increase may beregarded as an allowable cost increase for the purposes ofparagraph 14 if:(i)     it was a cost increase first incurred after 50 September 1972and(ii)     it was a cost increase incurred for one of the following:-(a) labour(b) materials or bought-in components, including fuel.(c) rent or rates.(d) interest charges, as defined in paragraph 18.16.   Price increases made on the basis of allowable cost increases may,subject to the other paragraphs of Part I of the Code, reflect theincrease in costs per unit of output since 30 September 1972, but maynot include any element of recoupment incurred between 30 September 1972and the date of the price increase.17*   Interest charges.   Increases in interest charges per unit of output payable by an enterprise are allowable cost increases, unlessin the view of the Price Commission:-(i)     they represent a distribution of profits rather than a true interest charge; or
(ii)     they are interest charges of a kind hitherto charged to capital account by the enterprise concerned; or(iii)     where they arise on loans between related undertakings,they relate to loans which are not strictly required forthe business, or are at a rate of interest higher than would be charged in a transaction at arm&apos;s length.Reductions in interest costs must also be taken into account in calculating costs per unit of output for the purposes of Part I of thnCode.9
19.     Examples of increases in expenditure which are not allowable cost increases because they are inconsistent with the Code are:-i. any part of a pay increase which exceeds the pay limit,unless given under a settlement reached before 6 November 1972and specifically exempted from the limit by Part II of the Code.ii. any part of increases in earnings under settlementsrelating to piecework or payment by results which exceeds the pay limit, except where this arises directly from increased output.iii. any part of increases in pay under settlements made at local or plant level which, when aggregated with increases undera national agreement, exceeds the pay limit for the group ofworkers concerned.18.     pay  not consistent with the Code. Increases in expenditure on pay or other conditions of service after 5 November 1972 are allowable cost increases only to the extent that:-i. they were consistent with the policies set out in Cmnd 5125(A Programme for Controlling Inflation:    The First Stage)., withthe requirements at the relevant time of the Counter Inflation(Temporary Provisions) Act 1972 and of any notice or order under it; orii. they are consistent with the Code.
20.   Anticipation of Cost Increases.   Future cost increases will beallowable cost increases only if and to the extent that:-i. the increase is of known amount and date of operation,and satisfies the other requirements for allowable cost increases under the Code; and ii. the increase will take effect not more than 3 monthsafter the relevant price increase.21.   Paragraph 20 does not apply to competitive tenders, or to partsof such tenders, which are at fixed prices.22.   Cost increases before 1 October 1972.   Cost increases firstincurred before 1 October 1972 may rank as allowable cost increasesonly if, on application, the Price Commission are satisfied thatthere are exceptional circumstances to justify this.   They will normally consider such an application only if there has been exceptionalabsorption of cost increases by the enterprise concerned in the period before 1 October 1972.23.   Exports and Domestic Prices.   Where an undertaking sells in both home and overseas markets and an allocation of particular costs,especially overhead costs, between the two markets cannot readily bemade, these costs may be divided in proportion to the value of sales in each market in arriving at allowable cost increases for the home market.24.   Where goods or services are sold on both home and overseas markets and differential pricing is ruled out either by international agreement or on practical grounds, the price may be fixed by reference11
to the requirements of the export market if the loss of foreign currency earnings would otherwise be substantial in the circumstancesof the particular product, after allowing for possible extra exportsales from a lower price.
25.   Transfer Prices.   Where in the view of the Price Commission costs which an enterprise proposes to regard as allowable cost increases arehadhigher than they would be if the goods or services/been obtained on anarm&apos;s length basis, they may disallow those cost increases.26.   Costs of certain small enterprises.   Where in the opinion of thePrice Commission:-(i)   significant cost increases have occurred or are about to occur in a sector of industry or commerce which includes aconsiderable number of small enterprises, especially thoseproviding services; and(ii)   the information available to them indicates that these cost increases are likely to be of broadly the same order for asubstantial number of such enterprises, in respect either ofsome or of all the goods or services whichthey supply,the Commission may calculate average allowable cost increases forsome or all the goods or services supplied by that sector.   The averageallowable cost increases so calculated shall then be taken as theallowable cost increases for the relevant goods or services for enter-prises within the sector.27. In calculating average allowable cost increases under paragraph 26the Commission shall take account of:-(i)   all relevant information available to them on cost increases for the goods or services concerned, including in particularany such information supplied by any trade association orother body which they consider to be representative of the enterprises concerned.13
(ii)    any other relevant provisions of the Code.28.     In any information or advice published by the Price Commissionon the application of the Code to enterprises falling within paragraph26, they shall include information about any average allowable cost increases which they have determined under paragraph 26, togetherwith an indication of any price increase, or rate of price increase,which they would be likely to regard as justified under the Code onthe basis of those average allowable cost increases.Relationship of Price Increases to Allowable Cost Increases29.     Productivity deduction.    In arriving at the amount of allowable cost increases which may be passed on as price increases, a deductionmust be made from /&quot;allowable cost increases per unit of output inrespect of productivity improvements equal to at least 5 per cent oflabour cost per unit of output/7.30.     Future level of sales.     Any price increase per unit of outputbased on allowable cost increases, as reduced under paragraph 29, mustbe calculated by reference tc the best available forecast of futuresales.31.     Stocks.     Price increases should not be made on stocks of goodsbought in or manufactured at earlier and lower cost levels.32.     Escalation Clauses.     Price increases under escalation clausesproviding for automatic increases in specified circumstances shouldnot be applied, except to the extent that the increases are consistent with the Code, and in particular with the paragraphs relating toallowable cost increases and control of profit margins.
33.     Prices of related products.     Where an enterprise has allowable cost increases affecting a product or range of products and a price increase in respect of them is permissible under the Code the enter-prise may distribute the price increase over a group of related products which includes those on which the increase arises.    It may do this without applying the price increase precisely to products onwhich cost increases have arisen, provided that in doing so it follows established practice in that particular trade or business.3k.     Quantity and Quality Change.     Quantity or quality changes insales units of goods or services may not be made as a means of avoid-ing the provisions of the Code relating to allowable cost increases.A reduction in quantity or quality is equivalent for the purposes ofthe Code to a price increase.35.     New &quot;products.     Those concerned in determining prices for newproducts are required to have regard to the Code.     Where a price fora new product has been determined provisionally and it is proposed toincrease that price, the increase should not be more than is justifiedhaving regard to:-(i) allowable cost increases since 1 October 1972, or the dateof the provisional determination if later(ii) any change in the nature of the product, or in the marketforeseen for it.36.     Priqe Reductions.     As stated in paragraphic price reductions should be made to reflect fully any fall in the costs per unit of output of an enterprise which has taken place since the last pricechange.     This includes cases where sales exceed the forecast on thebasis of which the current price was determined, with a consequent reduction in costs per unit of output.       Reductions may also berequired under other paragraphs of the Code, for example where net profit margins exceed the reference level referred to in paragraph 38beloW* CONFIDENTIAL15
I37.   Gales at a loss.    Where an enterprise is selling- particular goodsor services at a price at which, after any possible economies orI improvements in efficiency have been Tiade, net revenue is less than[avoidable costs, it may increase the relevant price so as to recoverthose costs in full, provided that it can dc so   consistently with the[limitations on net profit margins described below.   Where an enterpriseis making an overall loss, it may increase prices to cover its average[costs.Profit Margins38.   Prices and Profit Margins.   As a further measure of price restraint,prices should be determined so as to secure that net profit marginsbefore Corporation or Income Tax expressed is a percentage of sales orturnover do not exceed the equivalent of the average level in the besttwo of the last five complete years of account of the enterpriseconcerned preceding 30 April 1973 (the &quot;reference level&quot;).39. For the purposes of paragraph 38 net profit margins means tradingprofits, net of depreciation and interest, as a percentage of sales of controlled goods or services to the United Kingdom market.40.   Price reductions where profit margin likely to be exceeded.   Wherethe reference level has been exceeded, or where in the light of interimaccounts or other evidence it is likely tobe exceeded, price reductions(or abatements in allowable cost increases) should be made corresponding to the actual or anticipated excess.Unit for Profit Margin Control.   Profit margins may be calculatedfor the purpose of paragraph 38 either in respect of a complete enter-price or in respect of a major sub-division of the enterprise, providedthat in the latter case:
either (i) the major sub-division was at 1 January 1973 a separatelegal entity, for example a separate company or (ii) there was before 1 January 1973 an established practiceof producing separate audited accounts for the majorsub-division.17
42.   Profit margins and indirect taxes.   In making comparisons betweennet profit margins as a percentage of sales and the reference level,due account must be taken of the effect on margins of changes inindirect taxation on goods and services sold.   The comparison withearlier years should be made on a basis which excludes purchase taxin the period up to the end of March 1973 and excludes VAT from1 April 1973 onwards but includes excise duties in both cases.   Wherethe purchase tax element is not precisely known, as in the case ofunregistered wholesalers and retailers, one of the methods set out below should be used for estimating it:-i. total purchase tax on purchases (as ascertained frompurchase invoices) may be deducted from tax-inclusive sales; orii. where i. is impracticable, the purchase tax element insales over a year can be estimated on the basis of the amount of purchase tax claimed as a rebate on stocks as at 1 April 1973.43.   Modified base period for profit margin calculation.   Where an enterprise has traded for less than 5 complete years, or has tradedat a loss in one or more of the last 5 years, the reference level forparagraph 39 may be calculated as follows:-i. if there have been 4 years of trading, the average of thebest 2; if 3 or 2 years, the best year; if 1 year, the net profit margin of that yearii. any year in which an enterprise made a loss may be treatedas equivalent to a year of no trading and subparagraph i. maybe applied accordingly.
A new company, which is not formed from a reconstruction oramalgamation of existing companies, will not he subject to the profit margin limitation until it has completed one year&apos;s trading, after which it will be subject to paragraph k3(i).ti5.      For a new company formed from a reconstruction or amalgamation of existing companies the reference level will be calculated inrelation to the aggregate net trading profits of the constituentcompanies as a percentage of their average sales.    Paragraphs k3 andkl to u10 will apply to such a company.U6.      Where in the view of the Price Commission the reference levelof an enterprise for paragraph 38 requires modification because of a major reconstruction of the enterprise during the base period, or a major change in the character of its business they may agree orstipulate a modified reference level which in their judgement giveseffect to the principles of paragraphs 38 to k5 and paragraphs kl to1+9,
2047.   Low profits.    Where the net profit margin calculated as described in paragraph 38 or paragraph 43 represents a return on capital of lessthan 5 per cent, the enterprise concerned may calculate the level of net profit margin needed to produce a return of 5 per cent on capital and may treat that level as its reference level for paragraph 38.48.    In the case of a service enterprise of a kind appearing in sections XXIV to XXVI of the Standard Industrial Classification(see Appendix), paragraph 4-7 must be read as referring to a return of1 per cent on turnover rather than to 5 per cent on capital.49.    An enterprise with an annual turnover exceeding  1m may apply the higher reference level permitted by paragraph 47 or 48 only afterapproval by the Price Commission.    In calculating return on capital orreturn on turnover for this purpose an enterprise must adhere to thebasis of calculation of capital or turnover which it has regularlyemployed before 1 January 1973.Investment50.   Where the Price Commission are satisfied that the application ina particular case of the limits on allowable cost increases or onprofit margins would seriously impede investment by depriving the enter-prise concerned of funds essential for that prupose, they may permitsome departure from those limits, provided they are satisfied that the investment will in fact take place.
Particular Sectors51.   The paragraphs which follow deal with the application of thispart of the Code to certain important sectors.   Unless there is expressprovision to the contrary in those paragraphs, however, paragraphs9 to 50 must be taken as applying to all enterprises.Manufacturers52.   Paragraphs 9-50 above apply in their entirety.Wholesalers and Retailers53.   Limitation of gross percentage margins.   Paragraphs 14-37(allowable cost increases) do not apply to wholesalers, retailersor other distributors.   However, in the determination of prices forsales to the United Kingdom market, gross percentage margins ofwholesalers or retailers should not exceed the level of the lastcomplete account year of the enterprise concerned ending on or before30 April 1973, less an appropriate deduction for the abolition of SET.54.     Where the costs of particular goods to wholesalers or retailersrise sharply (that is to say, substantially out of line with anygeneral movement in the price level), the enterprises concerned should reduce their percentage margins to take account of the disproportionateincrease in price.21I
55.       If an enterprise or any part or any organisation representingpart of the wholesale or retail trade is unable to keep within the gross percentage margin because increased costs are too great to be absorbed through increased sales or improves productivity, the price commission may allow the gross percentage margin to be increased.56.      Price reductions should be made when a distributor^ net profit margin exceeds the reference level.57.       Gross percentage margins and indirect tax.    In calculating gross percentage margins for the purposes of paragraphs 53-55, the principle to be applied is that the gross margin in the previous account year should be calculated as a percentage of sales exclusive of purchase tax and compared with the gross margin after abolition of purchase taxas a percentage of sales excluding VAT.     Where unregistered whole-wholesalers or retailers have no records of the purchase tax content oftheir sales in earlier years, one of the following methods may beadopted for estimating the value of sales excluding tax:(i) the method described in paragraph Ul(i) or (ii); or(ii) estimates should be prepared of the value in the previousaccounting year of sales of goods chargeable at each ofthe 3 purchase tax rates and of goods free of purchase tax,and of the average gross margin on each of these cate-gories of sales.     Prom these figures the gross margin onsales exclusive of tax can be calculated.Food58.      The prices of manufactured food and drink are controlled in thesame way as those of manufactured products generally.     The prices of semi-processed foodstuffs such as butter, cheese, sugar and quick-frozen vegetables are controlled on the same basis.1I :
59.       The prices paid to United Kingdom producers or producers&apos;organisations or to importers for fresh foods and similar products which are subject to fluctuations on world and United Kingdom marketsbecause of seasonal factors or international changes in 1he relation-ship between supply and demand, are not controlled.   This applies inparticular to meat, including bacon and poultry, fish, eggs, fruit and vegetables.     However enterprises which resell these foods,whether home produced or imported, at any subsequent stage will besubject to the controls on prices described in the Code.     In partic-ular, prices of wholesalers and retailers are subject to the control on gross percentage margins, as well as to the net profit margincontrol.23
2460.   The fresh foods and other similar products referred to in paragraph59 are those products which are produced in the course of agruculture,horticulture or fishing and which have not been processed orincorporated in any processed product.   For this purpose processingdoes not include the breaking down of a bulk supply, the cleaning and the cutting up of produce and the chilling, freezing, curing and boning ofcarcasses or parts of carcasses of livestock and of any products of fishing.61.   The prices of food or drink sold in catering establishments forconsumption there are controlled by reference to allowable cost increases and are subject to the net profit margin control.Agriculture62.   Part I of the Code does not apply to agricultural enterprisesengaged in the production and sale of unprocessed agricultural produce.Where such enterprises engage in manufacturing or processing however,their prices are controlled by reference to allowable costs and net profit margins.   Where they engage in distribution, their prices are controlled by reference to gross percentage margins and net profit margins.
Nationalised Industries63.     The provisions of the Code as to prices will apply tothe nationalised industries listed below as they apply to private sector undertakings except that for the time being a nationalised industry in deficit will not be permitted to increase its prices bymore than its allowable cost increases, as defined in paragraphs 14to 25, in order to reduce that deficit.National Coal board electricity Council, Area Electricity Boards and central Electricity Generating board north of Scotland Hydro-Electric board south of Scotland Electricity board british Gas corporation british Steel corporation post office British Overseas Airways corporation british European AirwaysBritish Airways board british Airports authority british Railways board british Transport Docks board british Waterways board in the case of the National Coal Board and the British steel corporation, this is subject to what is said in paragraph 59, andin the case of the Post Office and those industries concerned with air and sea transport, to the exclusion from control under paragraph12(v) of charges for international traffic.   The prices of subsidiary companies of nationalised industries, including subsidiaries of theNational Bus Company, National Freight Corporation and the Scottish transport Group, are governed by paragraph 68(ii).25
64.   As with a private sector enterprise selling at a loss, a nationalised industry in substantial deficit:-(i)    will not be required to make a deduction inrespect of productivity improvements from allowable cost increases under paragraph 29; and(ii)   will not be required to assume a higher level of output than the current one in reflecting allowable cost increases in prices under paragraph 30Coal and Steel65.   Prices charged by producers for coal, coal-basedsolid fuels and most steel products are outside the scopeof the control by virture of paragraph 13 (ii)-   They are subject to international obligations through United kingdom membership of the European Coal and Steel Comcmnity.    In anyother cases prices of steel products (including those of theprivate sector) are controlled like those of other manufactured products.   Prices of coal and steel merchants in theUnited Kingdom will be subject to the control of gross percentage margins and net profit margins applied to wholesalersand retailers.
66.    Companies which produce both ECSC and non-ECSC iron andsteel products will be subject to price control on the latteronly.   Where a non-ECSC product is made from an ECSC product,the lowest market price for the latter will be an allowable cost.   For the purpose of calculating the limit on profit margins,only the profits from converting ECSC products into the finalnon-ECSC products will be relevant.Other public sector trading enterprises67.   The Price Commission will apply to proposals for price increases which are referred to them by Government Departments engaged insubstantial trading operations the same principles as to proposals bythe nationalised industries.68. The Code applies to the prices of the following enterprises,according to the nature of the business of the undertaking, as it applies to the prices of private sector enterprises:-(i)   trading services of local authorities, local authorityjoint boards, public utility undertakings and other similar public sector undertakings (not being nationalised industries)(ii)   companies registered under the Companies Acts which are wholly or partly owned by Her Majesty&apos;s Government, or bya nationalised industry.
28Water Undertakings69.   Water Undertakings, whether they are public sectorundertakings or private water companies, are subject to Statutorylimitations on deficits, on surpluses or profits, on profitdistributions and on borrowing.    Their water rates arealready controlled to a large extent through these limitations.Subject to these Statutory obligations, they will be required tocomply with the principles of the Code and in particular withthe paragraphs relating to allowable cost increases.
Services70.   In general, paragraphs 9 to 50 of the Code apply to the pricesof service enterprises as they apply to those of manufacturers, sothat the system of allowable cost increases and the limitations on net profit margins per unit of output apply to them.   These willusually he an offset to allowable cost increases as a resultof the abolition of Selective Employment Tax for service enterprises.Paragraphs 26 to 28 permit the Price Commission to calculateaverage allowable cost increases for certain small service enterprises where the circumstances are appropriate.   The following paragraphs deal with the application of the Code to some particular service sectors, and explain any modifications of the general principles which apply to them.Banking71.   Interest rates are not controlled.   Subject to paragraph 12, allother charges by banking enterprises are within the control howeverand the system of allowable cost increases and the limitations onnet profit margins apply to them.Construction72.   In general, the Code applies to prices of construction enterprisesas to those of manufacturing enterprises.   In particular therequirements of the Code relating to allowable cost increases andthe limitation on net profit margins apply as appropriate to:-(i)   prices quoted in competitive and non-competitive tenders.Paragraph 21 may however apply,(ii)   variation of price clauses in construction contracts.Revision of prices under such clauses will be governed by the Code.
Transport73-   The Code applies to transport undertakings as it does to manufacturing enterprises.   Charges for International freight and passenger traffic are outside the control under paragraph 12 (V).Charges of nationalised transport undertakings, passenger transport authorities, local authority transport undertakings and transport companies owned by nationalised industries are governed byparagraphs 63   to 64 and 68.74.   Charges of private road haulage undertakings are subject inter aliato the provisions relating to allowable costs and to the limitations on net profit margins.   Any increases in rates notified on anational or regional basis to such undertakings by a representative body will require prior approval by the Price Commission.Hotels and Catering Enterprises75* What is said in paragraph 70 applies to these enterprises also,in respect both of charges for food and drink and for accommodation.Professional Services76.   Fees and charges for professional services by firms or by individuals who are self-employed are governed by Part I of the code as prices.   In general, what is said in paragraph 70 applies to them.   The pay of professional staff who are employees is however governed by Part II of the Code, as is the remuneration from public funds of doctors and dentists.   Where scales or rates of charges of general application are in use in a profession under instructions or advice issued by a professional association or otherrepresentative organisation, those scales or rates may not beincreased without the agreement of the Price Commission.   The commission should apply the provisions relating to allowable cost increases tothose scales or rates. CONFIDENTIAL
Membership Organisations77*   Charges by way of subscriptions by organisations which:(i)   exist for charitable or recreational purposes and(ii)   are non-profit making and(iii)   do not carry on a trade or business as their mainactivity, will not be controlled.78.   Prices charged in any trading activity carried on by an organisation which meets the requirements of paragraph 77 are&apos;governed by the Code, unless the customers of the trading activityare confined to members of the organisation.
P:\RT II:    pay general Principle.079.    Th^ general principles rel^tinp&quot; to pay are:-(i) to limit thn r^te of increase in pay in mone;/ terms to a level more nearly in line with the growth of national output,po as to reduce price inflation progressively and improve theprospects of sustained faster growth in real earnings.(ii) to apply the limit fairly across the whole field, irrespective of the form of any increase or &quot;&quot;&quot;he method of determining it.(iii)To facilitate an improvement in the relative position ofthe low paid.(iv) To leave to those who normally determine pay, decisions onthe amount, form and distribution of increases within the limit.80.   For all these purposes &quot;pey&quot; has the meaning given to it inparagraphs 79 &amp; 81.Scope81.   This part of the Code applies to all employment incomes   (exceptself employment incomes which are in p-eneral covered by Part I of the code)   whether determined at national, local, plant or any otherlevel; and whether determined by collective bargaining, by arbitration,by statutory wage fixing bodies, or without collective agreement.    it applies to all types of employment, to all wages and salaries at whatever level, including allowances, payments by results, payments in kind and lump sums, and to both full-time and part-time employees in whatever size of undertaking.
CONFIDENTIAL82.   All concerned, with the determination of employment income?must have regard to the provisions of the Code.83.    With certain limited exceptions specified below, improvements in terms and conditions of employment other than pay must be costedand taken into account in determining whether the nay limit isexceeded.    References to pay throughout the Code are therefore to betaken to refer to remuneration in employment and to include references to other terms and conditions of employment with the exception.-?speci fied.84.   References throughout the Code to settlements are to be tekenas including references to the determination by any method of enyemployment income.85o   Where reference is made in the Code to a group, the group will normally be the same as that used for the purpose of pay decisions inthe preceding 12 months.    It will, however, remain open to thopeconcerned to vary the groups which are to be \ised as the basis of paydetermination.   Where pay is fixed on an individual basis, theprovisions apply to the individual as they would to a group.Intervals between increases86.    No group may receive an increase in pay under a settlement made after 6 November 197? less than 12 months after most members of thegroup last received an increase unless:-(i)   an earlier date for such increase was specified (otherthan by reference to changes in indices and rates of pay for otiergroups) in a settlement made before 6 November 1972;
(ii) the last increase was deferred as a result of the standstillunder the White Paper (Cmnd 51?5), in which cvse the 1? monthscounts from the date from which the lnst increase would otherwise have operated;(iii)the increase in question was minor in which case the 12 monthscounts from the operative date of the last principal increase;(iv) the group concerned are covered by settlements at different levels as mentioned in paragraphs 118-119 below, in which capethe above requirements apply separately to each level of settlement.The Pay Limit87.    During the twelve months beginning with the operative date ofthe first pay settlement reached for ^ny group after 6 November 197?,the total of increases in pay for that group per head shall not exceed the pay limit described in paragraph 88.   For those whose general increase was deferred by the standstill, the twelve months will betreated as beginning with the date from which that increase would otherwise have operated:   paragraph 86 refers.88.    The pay limit is  1 per week per head plus 4 per cent of theaverage pay bill per head of the group for the twelve months immediately preceding the operative date of the first pay settlementreached for the group after 6 November 1972.89.   The average pay bill per head for this purpose excludes theeffects of absences from work due to absenteeism, sickness., short-time working or to stoppages from any other cause.
90.   Subject to paragraph 94 the cost of overtime will also be excluded from the pay bill and will not count against the pay limit for the group, as will employers&apos; national insurance contributions,selective employment tax and the cost of pensions schemes andredundancy payments.91.   In calculating the average pay bill per head for the preceding1? months, part-time workers should be counted broadly according to theproportion which their hours bear to the standard hours of the group.92.   For any group therefore where average weekly eqrnings per head(excluding the items mentioned in paragraph 90) do not vary from anycause other than those described in paragraph 89, the pay limit allowsaverage weekly earnings to be increased by 4 per cent plus ?/1 a week,less the cost of any improvements in other conditions of employment which count against the pay limit.   Where rates of pay representearnings apart from the factors mentioned in paragraphs 89-90, the &quot;1 pins 4 per cent may be added to rates.9?.   Whether this method or any other is used to calculate or express a nay increase or increases, it must produce a result which does notexceed the pay limit in paragraph 88.    It will be the responsibilityof those concerned with settling pay to satisfy the Pay Board, if required, that the method used does produce this result.94.   Overtime, shift, rest day and weekend working.   Payment forhours which are normal working hours within the meaning of Schedule ?.to the Contracts of Employment Act, 1972.   This should be included inthe pay bill for the purpose of calculating the pay limit, and the35
effect on such payments of -my improvement in pay will, count againstthe pay limit.    If there is any widening of the existing percentagedifferential between rates of pay for overtime, shift, rest day andweekend working and the effective r-ite of pay for standard hours(for example if the overtime multiplier is increased from time and a third to time and a half), the additional cost of this will count infull against the pay limit.   The cost must be calculated on theassumption that the amount of such working in the twelve months fromthe operative date of the settlement will be at 1 east as much as inthe preceding 1? months.   Otherwise, the cost of such working shouldbe excluded &quot;from the pay bill  for the purpose of calculating the pay limit, and any increase in the cost of such working (including increasesresulting directly from an increase within the pay limit for the normal working week) will not count against the pay limit.Pay Determination within the limit95.   Increases subject to the pay limit must not exceed  ?50 for any individual.   If the individual works part time this limit must bereduced broadly according to the proportion his hours bear to standardhours for the group to which he belongs.
96.    Subject to this individual limit, it will be for negotiatorsand others concerned with pay determination to decide on the amount and distribution of increases within the pay limit, and on the division between increases in wages or salaries and improvements inother conditions of service which count against the limit.   Theyshould, however,have full regard to the objective of improving therelative position of the low paid in the distribution of increaseswithin the limit.Other Improvements in Pay and Conditions:Equal Pay97.   Orderly progress towards achievement of the requirements of theEqual Pay Act 1970 may be made outside the pay limit on the basis setout below.98.    Subject to paragraph 99 an increase for this purpose is outsidethe pay limit to the extent that, by the end of 1973* it reduces by not more than one third any differential between men&apos;s and women&apos;rates which existed at 31 December 1972 and which is required by theEqual Pay Act to be eliminated by 29 December 1975.   Any increase inexcess of this counts against the pay limit.99.   The provision in paragraph 98 permitting increases outside the pay limit can only be used so long as the position of women&apos;s ratesrelative to men&apos;s has been at least maintained in percentage termsby any other increase affecting the group concerned.Hours100. Reductions in standard working hours may be made outside the pay limit if they reduce working hours to not less than kO hours a week,net of meal breaks.101. Reductions in standard working hours other than as in paragraph
100 count against the pay limit.   The true cost must he set againstthe pay limit hut in no case should the cost he treated as less thanproportional to the reduction (so that for example a reduction of onehour in U0 must he treated as equivalent to a 2-g- per cent increase in pay) unless the Pay Board can he satisfied that the true cost is less.Holidays102. Improvements in holidays do not count against the pay limit if theyincrease the total holidays for any group to not more than the equiva-lent of 3 weeks a year.    In deciding whether holidays are equivalent to3 weeks the following are excluded:-i. up to six occasional or public holidays; and ii. rest days taken in lieu of weekends or overtime; and. rest days granted before 6 November 1972 in lieu ofa shorter working week.103. Improvements in holidays other than as in paragraph 102 count against the pay limit on the basis of their true cost.Personal Increments10U.    Save as provided in paragraph 105 below any net addition to theannual pay bill per head of a group resulting from the payment of personal increments counts against the pay limit.
105. Where personal increments are part of a well established systemof increments^ &apos; based on merit, age or seniority which was in forcebefore 6 November 1972 and they do not exceed those paid in similar circumstances in previous years, any net addition to the annual paybill per head for the group concerned will not count against the pay limit, except to the extent that the increments contain any element of the kind described in paragraph 106.106. Any element in the increments specified in para 105 which relates to factors not personal to the individual concerned, such as cost ofliving increases or company profits (other than under a profit sharingscheme as it existed before 6 November 1972) must count against the pay limit for the group and the individual  250 limit.Promotion and regrading107. In cases of individual promotion or regrading, an increasecommensurate with greater responsibility or greater effort may be givenoutside the pay limit.   Where this test is not satisfied any increasein pay counts against the pay limit.108. The cost of any general regrading scheme will count against the pay limit.New employees and new work109. New recruits to existing jobs must not be paid more than thosethey replace or more than the rate paid currently by the employerconcerned for the same job.Footnote to paragraph 105(1) Systems which meet the requirements of this paragraph are not limited to those where rates of pay are expressed as apredetermined range or scale.
110. The rate for new work must not &quot;be more than the current ratepaid in the locality for the same or most nearly similar work by thesame or other employers.Recognised Terms and Conditions111. The cost of increases to meet the purposes of Section 8 of theTerms and Conditions of Employment Act, 1959* the Road Haulage WagesAct, 1938, similar legislation and the Pair Wages Resolution of 1946will not count against the pay limit.40
112.     New or improved benefits under occupational pension schemes which qualify for tax relief and any reimbursement of a corresponding increase in employee contributions may, subject to paragraph 113, &quot;be given  outside the pay limit.113-     Where a change in a pension scheme has the effect of increasingthe pay net of any pension contribution of a substantial proportionof the group of employees covered by the scheme, that increasecounts against the pay limit unless:(i) a revaluation of the scheme has shown a surplus in respectof those receiving the increase, the value of which equalsor exceeds the increase(ii)     there has been a corresponding reduction in benefits tothose receiving the increase and/or (iii)     the change had been proposed before 6 November 1972.Redundancy payments114. New or improved benefits under schemes for payments to workers who leave an employer&apos;s service because of redundancy are outside the pay limit.115.     Share option, share incentive and profit sharing schemesPayments or benefits under the terms of schemes existing prior to6 November 1972, and made or given strictly in accordance with thescheme as it stood at that date, will not count against the pay limit.Any other payments or benefits under such schemes must be countedagainst the pay limit if quantifiable, and if not quantifiable, maynot be given.
CONFIDENTIALOther benefits116.     All improvements in terms and conditions of service count against the pay limit, unless specifically exempted.    In addition tothose already mentioned the following are examples of benefits whichcount against the pay limit if they are introduced, extended in scopeor otherwise improved:-Benefits in kind, including the provisions of cars partlyor wholly for private use, living accommodation at less thaneconomic cost etc.Loans at below market rate, eg for house purchaseLunch or other meal vouchersSeasonal bonusesResponsibility allowancesShift payNight duty allowancesLondon allowance or other geographical allowanceStand-by paymentsLay off and sick pay117*     Reimbursement of expenses incurred in the course of the job(including removal expenses) do not count against the pay limit.   Whenexpenses are reimbursed by fixed allowances, these may be increasedoutside the pay limit, provided that the increase can be fully justified on the ground of increases in the relevant costs.Particular Methods and Systems of PaymentNational, Local and Plant Increases118.     Where settlements or pay determinations for a particular group of workers are concluded at more than one level, for example a settle-ment at national or industry level is supplemented by settlements at
local or plant level, the total resulting increase for the group forthe twelve months beginning with the first increase which countsagainst the pay limit must be kept within the pay limit.119*     Those negotiating locally or at plant level must count increases under any national settlement from which those in the group concernedbenefit against the pay limit for that group in arriving at the amount available for local or plant increases.   Where national negotiations are undertaken those concerned must take into account increases already given or in prospect at local or plant level for workers covered bythe national negotiations in arriving at the increase allowable.43
Payment by results, productivity and restructuring schemes120. Increases in pay under schemes of payment by results, includingpiecework, will count against the pay limit for the group concernedexcept in so far as they arise directly from increased output.   this applies to increased payments arising from changes in base rate,conversion rate, piecework prices or times, the fixed element or anyother source .121. For those covered by schemes of payment by results who alsobenefit from a general pay increase after 6 November 1972, the period for the application of the pay limit will be the 12 months following the general increase.122. In calculating the amount available within the pay limit forany general increase of the kind referred to in paragraph 121, account must be taken of any increases in pay under payment by results schemes which count against the limit under paragraph 120.   For this purpose it must be assumed that the percentage increase in pay arising fromthe operation of the schemes during the 12 months following the general increase will be at least as great as the percentage increase in thepreceding 12 months.123. Except as in paragraph 124, increases in pay under productivityschemes or schemes for restructuring pay and work introduced after November 1972 count against the pay limit.1124. Where:(i)   there was on 6 November an agreement to implement a programme of productivity schemes, or a restructuring, for
specified groups of employees in which the amount of pay orthe precise method by which it was to he calculated was clearlyspecified, leaving only the practical details of applicationof the scheme to particular groups to be settled; and(il) the employer or group of employers covered by theagreement had on 6 November already implementedthe programme in respect of some of the employees concerned,implementation of the programme in respect of the remainder ofthe specified groups may proceed and the resultant increases in pay need not count against the pay limit.45
Staged Increases125. Subject to the requirements of Cmnd 5125 and Cmnd 5205, settlementsreached on or before 6 November 1972 which provide for specifiedincreases on specified dates (and do so not merely by reference to changes in indices or other rates of pay) may be implemented in full andfrom their due date,126. The cost of such increases will count against the pay limit forthe group concerned except where the first such increase for a group is a minor stage of the pre-standstill settlement. Where the costequals or exceeds the pay limit no further increase affecting any ofthe group concerned which counts against the pay limit will be payable during the 12 months following the first of the increases to count against the pay limit.New long-term agreements127. Settlements may be made providing for staged increases at not lessthan 12 month intervals but implementation at the relevant time of the later stages will be subject to the provisions of the Code at that time.PART III:    GENERAL128. Where the provisions of the Code cannot be directly applied tothe circumstances of particular cases or sectors without modification,the Price Commission and the Pay Board shall, in exercising their powers, apply the Code with such adaptations or modifications as appear to them to be necessary to give effect to its general principles and objectives.
SECTION 3DIVIDENDS129.     Dividend control will continue to &quot;be administered by theTreasury.   However, Clause 9(3)(d) of the Counter-Inflation Billmakes it possible for one of the Agencies to play a part in theadministration of dividend restraint if this should be thoughtappropriate at some future date; and under Schedule 1 questions relatingto dividends may be referred to the appropriate Agency.PRINCIPLES OF DIVIDEND CONTROL130.     It is intended that the control of dividends should, as in thepresent standstill, operate on declarations; however Clause 9 also givespower to control payments of dividends should this be necessary.   except as indicated in the following paragraph, companies incorporated inthe United Kingdom will not normally be permitted, without the consent in writing of the Treasury, to declare dividends for any companyaccount year which exceed by more than 5% the amount of ordinarydividends declared by the company for the preceding company account year.Other analogous distributions out of the assets of a company are prohibited, except with the consent of the Treasury.   Since they cannotbe increased, fixed rate dividends are, however, not subject to control.SCOPE OF THE CONTROL131.     The requirement for dividend restraint is directed to allcompanies incorporated in the United Kingdom with the exception of:-(a)     Investment trusts as defined in Section 359 of the income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970.
(b) Close companies to the extent that they increasedistributions in order to comply with the special taxrules concerning such companies.(c) Companies entirely in the beneficial ownership of anothercompany or companies (except those in the ownership or part ownership of an investment trust) where ordinarydividend payments are exclusively inter-companytransactions.132*     Effect will be given to the control for quoted companies bylaying on Order applying Clause 9 to such companies, except where theyare in the categories mentioned above.   The Order will specify in detail the coverage of the control, the basis of comparison for purposes of calculation and other relevant factors.133*     Companies other than quoted companies will not be covered by theOrder.    They will, nevertheless, be subject to the same limitations on dividend declarations as quoted companies and will be expected tocomply with them.   The restrictions may be applied to individualunquoted companies by means of a notice given to that company.CALCULATION OP DIVIDENDS134.     In computing what dividends may be declared for a company&apos;s account year, the starting point will be the total amount of ordinary dividends declared for the last account year in respect ofwhich a profit and loss account of the company laid before it ingeneral meeting v/as compiled.   The money amount of these dividendsmay then be increased by 5% to give the total amount of the ordinarydividends which may be declared for the succeeding company account yea:
135.     In the case of dividends to be paid after 5 April 1973 j thebasis of comparison will need to take account of the changes incorporation tax which will come into operation on that date.   Thebasis of comparison will be between:-(a) Gross dividends paid before 6 April 1973 and(b) franked payments (that is the aggregate of dividendsand the relevant advance corporation tax payable thereon)made after 5 April 1973.The 5% increase applies to the amount of the gross dividend declaredfor the company&apos;s preceding account year.136.     Pro rata adjustments should also be made (i) to take account of changes of more than one month in the length of a company&apos;s accountingperiod; and (ii) where there has been a reduction in the company&apos;s share capital, or where a company&apos;s share capital has increased sincethe preceding account year and the increase reflects the value ofnew cash subscribed or other real consideration.   A company may make a normal capitalisation issue, but an increase in capital which is theresult of a capitalisation issue will not rank for increased dividend.
CONFIDENTIALSPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES137. The legislation v/ill empower the Treasury or one of the Agenciesto issue consents to allow companies to declare dividends which aregreater than the normally permitted level.    Such consents will only he granted in exceptional circumstances, and any application for such treatment must be made in writing well before any relevant boardmeeting.138. It is not possible to specify in advance precise rules applicableto all cases.   The following however indicates the way in which thecontrol will operate in particular circumstances:-a. Takeover Defence - Where the Treasury are satisfied thatan actual bid situation exists, companies wishing to defend themselves from the bidder by increasing their dividendsv/ill normally be allowed to do so.b. New Companies -   New companies fall into two main categoric.those formed by the reconstruction or amalgamation ofexisting companies, and others.    Companies formed as aresult of a reconstruction or merger of existing companies will normally be allowed to declare dividends net exceeding the aggregate of the dividends declared in the precedingaccount years by the parties to the merger, plus 5 per cent the control will not apply to dividends declared bycompletely new companies in respect of their first accountyear, or to those declared by former private or unquotedpublic companies coming to the market for the first time.c*       Recoveries -   Companies which have recovered from an adverstrading position v/ill normally be permitted to increase their dividends to the level of an earlier, more typical,year.   They will not, however, be allowed the 5 per centCONFIDENTIAL50
CONFIDENTIALincrease on top of this concession.Pre-6 november^pminitments - Some companies will have issuedformal prospectuses to their shareholders before the PrimeMinister&apos;s original announcement of dividend restraint on6 November 1972 in which they made certain statements of intent about future dividend declarations.   Provided theTreasury is satisfied that a sufficient commitment existsand that it was relevant to the actions of the people towhom the prospectus was addressed, it is the intention toallow such commitments to be honoured.51
SECTION kMACHINERY AND PROCEDURE:    PROPOSALS FOR SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS,NOTIFICATION AND REPORTINGSPECIAL ARRANGEMENTSFood139. It is proposed that a speoial panel of the Price commission should ha set up to deal with prices of food and drink.   This panelwill carry out the Commission^ functions in relation to the pricesof semi-processsd and manufactured foods, which will be controlledin the same way as manufactured products generally.   This cetegorywill cover almost two-thirds of consumers1 expenditure on food and drink.1UO. In addition, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foodwill instruct the Coamission to keep the prices of fresh food under continuous review.   For this purpose it is envisaged that theCoamission will establish a system of advisory coaaittees, including representatives of the public as well as of all sectors of the trade,which will review supplies and prices and will issue to the press and public regular advice and reports.   It will also be open to theCommission to carry out special inquiries into the circumstances affecting the price of any fresh food or drink.Construction1k1. The construction industry is not only of great iaportanoe tothe econoay but also has special features vhich call for a differentapproach in the application of counter-inflation policy to both prices and pay from that which applies to most other industries.   Thus on prices most construction work takes place on the basis of competitivetenders.   Similarly the application of the pay policy must take account of the extent of site bargaining and labour only sub-contracting as well as the large scale of self employment in theindustry.   The Government propose that a speoial Construction Panelshould be established including members of both the Price Commissionand Pay Board to examine these issues and make recommendations for action to the Commission and the Board, and if necessary through themto the Government.   The Government would be glad to discuss thepossibility of representation of both Bides of industry on this Panel.CONFIDENTIAL
NOTIFICATION, REPORTING AND RECORD KEEPINGPRICES1h2. There will he three different procedures for ensuring that theprices policy is effectively implemented:   prior notification of proposed price increases to the Price Commission, regular reportingto the Commission, and record keeping subject to spot checks by theCommission.   These correspond to the requirements for manufacturingcompanies in Categories I - III set out in paragraphs 6- 8 of theAppendix to Cand 5205.   The class of enterprise which the government proposes should be subject to each procedure will vary in differentsectors, because of their different characteristics.   The notificationand reporting requirements will be embodied in orders made under the counter-Inflation Bill when it becomes law.1U3. The requirements for enterprises in different sectors would normally be defined in terms of the value of sales in the domestic market during their last financial year ending not later than31 December 1972.   The proposed definitions are summarised in the table below.Requirements for enterprises in different sectorsdefined by value of domestic sales of controlledgoods and servicesManufacturing,Mining, public utilities andpublic passengertransportServicesPriornotificationand reportingover  50mover  20mReportingover  5- 50mover  5- 20mRecord-keeping 5m- lm 5- 0.1mWholesalers andretailersConstructionProfessionalServicesSee paragraphs153-15kNational scalesor ratesover  10mover  10aover  0.25m 10,- 0.1m 10m- 1m 0.25- 0.1m
CONFIDENTIALNotification11+4. The Price commission should generally he notified 8 weeks inadvance of the date on which the proposed price increase would comeinto effect.   If no reply is received within 28 days of the receiptof the application, with full supporting data, the Price commission will he deemed to have consented to the increase.   If the price commission is unable to complete its examination within 28 days itmay, before the expiry of that period, inform the applicant thatthe application is still under consideration.   The Commission must give a decision within a further 14 days (ie 42 days from the dateof the application).145.   The Price Commission will deal with all notifications as speedily as possible.   Where,      because of the nature of a product(eg a processed food heavily dependent on raw materials whichfluctuate in price), it is important that a decision is made in less than 28 days, every effort will be made to do so and it willbe open to the Price Commission to make special arrangements for such products.11+6. in addition certain enterprises whose sales in the domestic market fall below the figures in the second column or the tableabove, but which have a relatively large share, or are of special importance,in the market for particular goods will be required toprenotify.147. Mixed enterprises (those engaged in wholesale, retail or service operations as well as amnufacturing), will be required toprenotify price increases in their manufactured products where the sales of these products in the domestic market (including salesthrough their own wholesale or retail outlets) exceed  50m.Service activities of mixed enterprises which exceed the limitsshown in the table are also required to prenotify.
148. Two exemptions from the requirement to prenotify are proposed,The first exempts from prenotification prioe increases where:-(i)   Part of the business of a major enterprise is a subsidiary activity of a different character from themain business; and(II) the volume of home sales of the product or serviceprovided in the last company account year was less than 1m and represented under 5$ by value of the totaldomestio sales of the enterprise.149.   The second exemption concerns related products.   Where an enterprise receives consent from the Price Commission to anincrease in the price of a raw material which it produces, itshall not be required to pre-notify subsequently price increases of products incorporating this raw material, where these price increases are wholly consequential on the increased costs of thematerial.Reporting150.   All notifying and reporting enterprises will be required tosubmit to the Prioe Commission within 3 weeks after the end ofeach quarter reports on their costs, prices, sales, and profits.Where audited finanoial accounts are not available, figures derivedfrom management accounts may be used provided that these can indue course he reconciled with audited financial accounts.   Initiallythey will also be required to submit accounts for the previous2 years, included audited accounts for the latest year, andquarterly data for that year or a later period, as convenient to each company.   They should in addition provide sufficient information to establish the &quot;reference level&quot; for the profit margin control.
151.   The precise form of these reports will be a matter for consultation but they will be simple and the aim will be,wherever possible, to avoid asking companies to produce datawhich they do not need for their own purposes.Record Keeping152.   Those required to keep records will not normally need tosubmit them to the Price Commission but must do so on request bythe Commission.Construction153.   Prices tendered for construction services will not besubject to price approval by the Price Commission.   All firmsproviding these services with a turnover of more than  10 million a year will be required to submit to the Commission reports oftheir costs, prices and profits at 3 monthly intervals.   Firmswith a turnover of between  1 million and  10 million a year willbe required to maintain adequate records of their costs, prices and profits and to make them available to the Commission ifcalled upon to do so.154.   Firms engaged on or receiving contracts for constructionservices which are worth individually more than  5 million, andwhich include clauses providing for variation of prices, will berequired to provide the Commission with an outline description ofthe work, the form of contract in use, the items to which variation of price applies, and where applicable the amount of moneyreceived in payments under tha variation of prices provisionsduring the last three months.
Transport155.   Proposals to increase domestic passenger transport faxeswill be subject to pre-notification to the Price Commission asspecified in the table above, unless they already requireapproval under statute by the Traffic Commissioners, Civil aviation authority or other statutory body.   Proposals to increase nation?illynotified rates for road haulage by any representative body or association will also be subject to pre-notification.
PAYNumbers of tiers and levels156. The White Paper set out, as a basis for consultation, what wasin effect a 4-tier system:i. settlements affecting 500 or more employees to be notified to the Pay Board in advance;ii. settlements down to an unspecified lower limit to be notified when implemented;iii. &quot;all but the smallest firms&quot; to keep records;iv.   the smallest firms to be exempt even from record-keeping.Pre-not ifi cat ion157. The Government propose that settlements affecting 500 or moreemployees (whether or not in one firm) should be subject to pre-notification.   They should not be implemented until either the pay board gives its approval or 8 weeks have elapsed.   The suggestedfigure, however, is subject to review in the light of the presentvoluntary notification arrangements.   The method of pre-notificationis dealt with in paragraphs 160-163 below.Notification of settlements after implementation158. The proposed requirement is that settlements affecting 100-499employees should be notified after implementation.   The government also propose that periodic returns should be made to the Pay Boardof increases in earnings resulting from payment by results schemeswhere these relate to significant numbers of employees.   this information will enable the Board to carry out sample checks and toexamine cases of strategic importance to the policy;    it will also provide a basis for quarterly reports by the Pay Board on the generalprogress of the policy.
CONFIDENTIALRecord-keeping159. The requirement is that all firms with more than 10 employeesshould keep records showing the numbers of employees, pay bill, pay increases, dates of implementation and the effect on the pay bill.They should retain these records for at least 12 months.Method of pre-notificationl60. Clause 5 of the Bill envisages that settlements may be requiredto be notified to the Pay Board 8 weeks before implementation.    Sincethe Board must give 2 weeks&apos; notice of any intention to issue an order or notice, it will therefore have a maximum of 6 weeks to reach adecision.   The Board will of course give earlier decisions wherever possible.161. If normal implementation dates are to be maintained, a requirement to notify in advance of the date of implementationwould in most cases mean that negotiators would have torearrange their programmes in order to arriveat settlements 8 weeks before they were due to be implemented.   TheGovernment recognise that this may take some time to achieve, soth?.t the new requirement, even if announced very soon could scarcelybe made applicable to settlements due for implementation before 1 Julyat the earliest.   It may therefore be necessary for some of the settlements approved by the Board to be backdated.162, In order to reduce to a minimum the time necessary for theBoard to complete its examination of cases notified to it the pay board will no doubt wish to prepare itself in advance eg.,, by keepingitself informed of major negotiations in progress and by obtainingpreliminary information about the pay limit for the employees concerned and the extent to which any offers made by the employer duringnegotiations conform to it.CONFIDENTIAL
163. S; would be possible to impose a statutory requirement fornotification to the Pay Board of such basic information at thebeginning of negotiations and when offers are made.   It is howeverin the interests of those concerned to supply this information inorder to assist the Pay Board to reach early decisions on the finalproposed increase and the Government propose to rely on voluntarynotification of such advance information to the Pay Board.STATUTORY DETERMINATION OP PAY OR PRICES164. Statutory bodies which determine pay or prices will be requiredto have regard to the Code.   Their statutory obligations must be modified accordingly.   The Government proposes to achieve this by making an order under Clause 8 of the Counter Inflation Bill whichwill modify the relevant legislation.165. In the case of bus fares the right of appeal to the Secretaryof State against a decision of the Traffic Commissioners will remain,but in determining any appeals the Secretary of State will haveregard to the Code and may consult the Price Commission.   Rights ofappeal to the National Ports Council against ship, passenger and goodsdues will also be retained.   In determining appeals the National PortsCouncil will have regard to the Code and may consult the PricesCommission.(so
166.     The Code does not hind the Crown, either in relation to itsown prices or charges or the pay of its employees; or in itsstatutory functions in relation to other prices, charges or pay.The Government will apply the Code to pay settlements with which itis concerned, and will arrange for renotification of settlements towhich it is a party to the Pay Board.   The treatment of prices and charges by nationalised industries and by Government Departmentsengaged in substantial trading operations has already been explained in Section 2.   In relation to other prices and charges for whichit has responsibility, the Government propose to follow the principlesof the Code.   In many important cases however the Government isalready holding charges below the levels which the Code would require,and intends to continue to do so.
