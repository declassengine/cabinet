THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 3314 March 1973CABINETSTEEL prices note by the Secretary of State for Trade and industry at their meeting on 13 March, the Ministerial Committee on CounterInflationary Measures, considered my memorandum, covering a noteby the Minister for Industry, CIM (73) 12.    The Committee agreedthat the Home Secretary, as Chairman of the Cornrnittee, should report their discussion to the Prime Minister, and my colleagues will have seen his mJnute of today.    They may also find it helpful to have, asbackground for consideration by the Cabinet, the attached copy of theMinister for industry s note.COPY NODOp w department of Trade and Industry14 March 1973
STEEL prices note BY MINISTER FOR INDUSTRYSteel products covered &quot;by the Treaty of Paris are excluded from price control after the end of the freeze.     The British Steel Corporation(BSC) proposes to publish on 1 April a new price list giving an average increase over present delivered prices of 13.5% from 1 May.     Thiswould achieve an increase in realised prices of 11.6%.     The level would vary between product groups, as shown at Annex A.2       The simultaneous change to the basing point pricing systemrequired by the Treaty, under which transport is charged separately,will not affect the average increase.     Customers remote from basingpoints will experience increases larger than shown in Annex A, thosenear basing points less.     Some examples are in Annex B.3      There is no possibility of avoiding a substantial increase.European prices have been rising rapidly in the upward phase of the steel cycle, and still are;    already BSC would need increases larger than proposed in order to match European levels.     If BSC charges somuch below its competitors as to cause market distortions, while not making sufficient return to avoid suspicion of subsidy, it risks action by the Commission for breach of the Treaty.     BSC estimates that the increases would enable it to achieve a return of 6.0% on net assets in1973/74- before interest.     It considers that, in a boom year whensteel-makers are expecting to make up for recent poor returns, nothiigless is likely to be defensible in Europe.4      The price increase is important to private sector steel companies,who are effectively constrained by BSC prices.     They have suffered fromthe long period of price restraint imposed on BSC, and could be seriously damaged by its continuation.     They know what BSC wants, and if theGovernnHit were to prevent it they could well appeal to the european commission.5      A sharp increase in UK steel prices is generally expected but because of our counter-inflation policy I have examined with BSCwhether anything less than they propose would be practicable.     I am satisfied that there is little room for manoeuvre.     Even after theincrease, BSC prices will be below the average level in the community and likely to become increasingly out of line as Community prices firmup;    and another increase of about 10% will probably be needed inApril 1974.     If a smaller increase were made now, a second increase would instead become unavoidable within months, because the wideninggap between UK and Community prices could not then be held until 1974.6 For example, BSC might have been able to defend for a while raisinglist prices initially by only 10%, on the ground that this would just
allow it to break even after interest (though not to remunerate itspublic dividend capital).     But, in order to satisfy the Community andits competitors, BSC would also need to announce at the same time thatit was planning a second increase for October;    and this second increase would then have to be a further 11% for BSC to show the same (barelysufficient) return over the year as a whole.     Moreover a further 3%increase would still be necessary in April 1974--conclusion      In the circumstances I believe that the least damaging course isto acquiesce in BSC1s proposal for a single increase in list prices of13^/o (11.6% on realised prices) from 1 May, and I invite my colleagues to agree.     Having a single increase wholly within Phase 2 has theincidental advantage that users will be allowed to pass on only theamount of their steel cost increase, not to make a similar percentage increase in their selling prices.8      Under Cmnd 524-7 an increase in steel costs, like an increase inthe cost of any other materials, will be an allowable cost for firms who make products incorporating steel.     Those firms who normally haveto pre-notify the Price Commission and wait up to 8 weeks before theymay raise prices ought however to be permitted to pass on the increased costs directly consequential on an incrs.se in the price of ECSC steel products.     If they were obliged to wait for the Commission^ expressapproval there may otherwise be an unmanageable flood of applications from steel using industries shortly after the Commission is established,and the latter in turn would risk being damaged by the delay.     i suggest that a suitable amendment should be worked out for incorporation in the White Paper version of the Code, possibly by anamplification of paragraph 146 of the present Code.TBDepartment of Trade and industry Victoria StreetLondon SW1H OET9 March 1973
