IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S government cp(73) 3620 March 1973CABINETMORTGAGE FUNDS FOR PRIVATE HOUSEBUILDINGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. As the Cabinet requested on 15 March the Chancellor of theExchequer and I persuaded the Building Societies Association (BSA) not torecommend an immediate increase in the mortgage lending rate.    they recommended an increase in the investment rate from 5.6 per cent to6, 3 per cent with effect from 1 April, and deferred a decision on thelending rate until 13 April, while indicating to the Press that an increase to 9. 5 per cent had now become inevitable0    I now circulate proposals forusing this breathing space to the best advantage.2. I believe that our immediate objective must be to secure in full,both in 1973 and 1974f the output of up to 230, 000 new houses for sale ofwhich the housebuilding industry is capable.    An increase in the mortgagelending rate to 9, 5 per cent would increase the net cost (after tax relief) ofa typical new mortgage by 7 per cent on top of any increase in house prices.This would price a number of prospective purchasers out of the market andis likely to cause housebuilders to limit their output to a figure nearer200r 000 than 230, 000 houses a year in 1973 and 1974.    We should therefore consider whether it would be possible to defer an increase in the mortgagerate until the end of Stage 2 of our programme against inflation.    Ourlonger term objective is to stabilise the flow of mortgage funds so as toput an end to the alternation of slumps in private housebuilding (privatecompletions declined from 222, 000 in 1968 to 170, 000 in 1970) and explosions in house prices (prices increased by 41 per cent during 1972).I recognise the great difficulties in a large increase in the public borrowing requirement this year,    I am therefore putting forward revised proposalswhich involve only modest short-term Government support and leave open the extent if any, of longer term support.3, The increase in the investment rate to 6.3 per cent may not provesufficient.    To finance an annual output of 230, 000 houses, building societies need to increase monthly net new receipts from the recent rateof  120 million to  150- 170 million.4.        The building societies are opposed to maintaining the investmentrate at 6.3 per cent (let alone increasing it further) without an increase inthe mortgage lending rate, because the disparity causes them to operate at a loss, which falls on their reserves.    The present average ratio of1COPY NO       By
reserves to assets is about 30 5 p^r cent compared with tlie legal minimum of 1, 5-205 per cent0    Thus societies could, on average, bear the deficitfrom the disparity between investment and lending rates of 6e 3 per cent and 8. 5 per cent for some time by running down their reserves towardsthe legal minimum.    But it would be unrealistic to expect them to refrain from increasing their mortgage lending rate, without some prospect ofGovernment help.5, Whatever happens during the next six months, the immediateresponse of the housebuilding industry to the demand for home owuershipis bound to be affected by their expectations of the availability of mortgagefunds in the longer term,    If they feel too uncertain about the prospects for 1974, they will decide now to cut back starts during the second half of1973, which would have an irrevocable effect on completions in 1974.    Theneed to stabilise the flow of funds is the key to a high and stable level ofhousebuilding and we are much more likely to achieve this level if we are seen to be grappling with the problem in the longer term as well as for stage 2.    We need to be able to announce in the forthcoming White paper on Housing Policy that we have begun to consult the BSA about a longer term scheme for stabilisation.    We would make an even greater impactif we could say that we would be prepared to consider special treatment for first-time purchasers or lower-income mortgagors.6. I believe that we must row act to prevent a record increase in house prices from being followed by a disastrous decline in housebuilding,I propose that we should immediately begin discussions with the B3A witha view to agreeing the following package, for Stage 2,a. At the meeting on 13 April, the BSA would announce thatthey would net recommend during the period April to Septemberany increase in the mortgage lending rates and would during thattime discuss with the Government possible ways and means: ofstabilising the supply of mortgage funds,b. In return the Government would meet, by means of a subsidy, 50 per cent of the reduction between 1 April and30 September of the reserve ratio as certified by the ChiefRegistrar of Friendly Societies of any society with trustee statuswhich maintained its mortgage rate at 8f per cent.    Such a subsidy would require legislation.    It is unlikely to exceed   20-  35 million onthe basis of an investment rate of 603 per cent.c. If during the period April to September the investment rateof 6. 3 per cent was insufficient to sustain mortgage lending at separately equal to the average for 1972, plus an agreed percentage(say 10 per cent) to allow for the higher level of housebuilding and prices in 1973, BSA would raise the investment rate above6.3 per cent, but only with the Governments agreement.    Thiswould result in some modest increase in subsidy over the  20-  35 million envisaged in b. above.   (If, in the event, the increasedsubsidy were felt to be politically unacceptable, the Governmentcould consider the possibility of limited Exchequer loans at marketrates to societies whose liquidity ratio had been run down to aparticular level).2
d. There would be no prior commitment to Government support for a longer term stabilisation scheme- but the possibility of such support would not be ruled out for the purposes of discussion withthe BSA,    It might be possible to introduce the scheme without government support by adjusting the relationship of the investmentrate, the mortgage lending rate and the reserve ratio,,    Inparticular we would explore the scope for developing policiesdesigned to give preferential treatment to first-time purchasersor lower-income mortgagors.7. I invite the Cabinet to agree thati. I should begin discussions with the BSA, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with a view to an agreement on the lines of paragraph 6 above.ii. The forthcoming White Paper on housing should refer tothese discussions.G r department of the Environment20 March 19733
