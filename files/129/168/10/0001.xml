Part 1THE SEARCH FOR CONSENSUSThe Paper for DiscussionI. fn October 1972 the Government published &quot;The Future of NorthernIreland: A Paper for Discussion&quot;. This Paper reviewed the background, set outthe proposals made up to that time by the Northern Ireland parties and other interests, together with the wide range of theoretical options, established the basic facts political, economic and security- which would have to be taken intoaccount in moving towards a settlement, and stated the criteria which firm proposals for the future must meet.2. These fundamental criteria were set out in paragraph 79 of the Paper asfollows:(a) In accordance with the specific pledges given by successive United King-dom Governments, Northern Ireland must and will remain part of theUnited Kingdom for as long as that is the wish of a majority of thepeople; but that status does not preclude the necessary taking into accountof what has been described in this Paper as the &quot;Irish Dimension&quot;.(b) As long as Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom the sovereignty of the United Kingdom Parliament must be acknowledged,and due provision made for the United Kingdom Government to have an effective and continuing voice in Northern Ireland&apos;s affairs, commensurate with the commitment of financial, economic and military resources in theProvince.(c) Any division of powers and responsibilities between the national andthe regional authorities must be logical, open and clearly understood.Ambiguity in the relationship is a prescription for confusion andmisunderstanding. Any necessary checks, balances or controls must beapparent on the face of a new constitutional scheme.(d) The two primary purposes of any new institutions must be first to seek a much wider consensus than has hitherto existed; and second to be suchas will work efficiently and will be capable of providing the concreteresults of good government: peace and order, physical development,social and economic progress. This is fundamental because NorthernIreland&apos;s problems flow not just from a clash of national aspirations orfrom friction between the communities, but also from social and economicconditions such as inadequate housing and unemployment.(e) Any new institutions must be of a simple and businesslike character,appropriate to the powers and functions of a regional authority.(f) A Northern Ireland assembly or authority must be capable of involvingall its members constructively in ways which satisfy them and those they represent that the whole community has a part to play in the governmentof the Province. As a minimum this would involve assuring minoritygroups of an effective voice and a real influence; but there are strong arguments that the objective of real participation should be achieved by
giving minority interests a share in the exercise of executive power if this can be achieved by means which are not unduly complex or artificial,and which do not represent an obstacle to effective government.(g) There must be an assurance, built into any new structures, that therewill be absolute fairness and equality of opportunity for all. The future administration of Northern Ireland must be seen to be completely even-handed both in law and in fact.(/i) It is of great importance that future arrangements for security and public order in Northern Ireland must command public confidence, both inNorthern Ireland itself, and in the United Kingdom as a whole. If theyare to do so they must be seen in practice to be as impartial and effective as possible in restoring and maintaining peace and public order. In anysituation such as that which obtains at present, where the Army and the civilian police force are both involved in maintaining law and order andcombating terrorism, it is essential that there should be a single source of direct responsibility. Since Westminster alone can control the armed forces of the Crown this unified control must mean Westminster control.For the future any arrangements must ensure that the United KingdomGovernment has an effective and a determining voice in relation to any circumstances which involve, or may involve in the future, the commitment of the Armed Forces, the use of emergency powers, or repercussions atinternational level.Developments since Publication of the Paper for Discussion3. Exceptional measures were taken to ensure that the Paper for discussion would be as widely circulated and read as possible, particularly within NorthernIreland itself. In all 12,650 copies had been sold there, through H.M. stationery office and other Government offices, by 31 January 1973 and in addition 200,000leaflets based on the Paper had been distributed, and a tabloid summarycirculated with newspapers is estimated to have reached 1,209,000 readers.4. There were full parliamentary debates, in the House of Commons on13 November 1972 and in the House of Lords on 5 December 1972. Followingthese debates the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has had extensivediscussion on the basis of the Paper with political parties, leaders of the Churches,and other bodies and individuals in Northern Ireland. Although a very wide range of views was expressed, there was a considerable measure of agreement,not only within Northern Ireland but in the rest of the United Kingdom, in theIrish Republic and in overseas countries that the Paper for Discussion provided a thorough, fair and objective basis for considering the very complex problemsof Northern Ireland.5. The extensive consultations which both preceded and followed thepublication of the Paper for Discussion have not produced any single, agreedset of proposals for a constitutional settlement. Indeed, given the wide range of views and the complexity of the issues, it would have been surprising if theyhad. Many significant differences of opinion remain. Nevertheless, the con-consultations have been useful, indeed essential, in throwing up very significantareas of agreement:(a) Whatever their views on sovereignty and citizenship, most of those con-
suited (though not all) have favoured the restoration of some kind ofdevolved institutions of government in Northern Ireland.(b) There has been a wide area of agreement that the central feature of these institutions should be a single-chamber elected legislative Assemblyof 80-100 members.(c) There has also been a broad measure of agreement that a significant rolewithin such an Assembly should be allocated to a structure of powerfulcommittees (although the specific proposals for such a structure show considerable variations).(d) There has been general agreement that a new settlement should in someway or other make provision for the protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms.(e) Almost all the parties are prepared to accept new institutional arrangementsfor consultation and co-operation on an all-Ireland basis, though somemake their agreement conditional or limited.None of these courses is in any way inconsistent with United Kingdom policiesor interests.6. These consultations have shown that there are important aspects of a new constitutional settlement which can be based directly upon the views and theproposals of Northern Ireland parties and interests.7. There have been a number of other significant developments since thepublication of the Paper for Discussion. First, on 1 January 1973 the UnitedKingdom and the Republic of Ireland both became member countries of theEuropean Economic Communities, a development which is bound to have an ever-increasing impact upon the lives of all who live in these islands.8. Second, the then Government of the Republic of Ireland introduced, andthe Oireachtas carried into law, new legislation designed to cope with terroristactivity, and the authorities of the Republic have subsequently brought beforethe courts under these new powers a number of persons involved in theorganisation and direction of IRA terrorism throughout Ireland.9. Third, the Government has accepted in principle the report of LordDiplock&apos;s Commission (Cmnd. 5185), recommending various changes in thearrangements for the administration of justice in Northern Ireland so as tomake it possible to bring before the courts more of those engaged in terroristactivities in Northern Ireland, while pointing out that in some cases there is nosubstitute for procedures such as those prescribed by the Detention of TerroristsOrder 1972.10. Finally, on 8 March, 1973, a poll was held throughout Northern Ireland,in accordance with the Northern Ireland (Border Poll) Act 1972. The result,
declared on 00 March 1973, was that 00000000 electors voted in favour of thefirst proposition&quot;Do you want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom?&quot;while 0000000 electors voted in favour of the second proposition&quot;Do you want Northern Ireland to be joined with the Republic of Ireland,outside the United Kingdom?&quot;
Part 2CONDITIONS FOR A SETTLEMENT11. Successive United Kingdom Governments have affirmed that NorthernIreland will continue to be part of the United Kingdom unless and until its people decide otherwise, and a majority of the people in Northern Ireland havevoted in favour of the present status of Northern Ireland as part of the UnitedKingdom. It is the responsibility of the United Kingdom Parliament to determinehow Northern Ireland shall be governed as a part of the United Kingdom.12. There is a three-fold pattern of obligations:(a) The United Kingdom as a whole has an obligation to those of its citizens who live in Northern Ireland to afford them the fullest protection of the rule of law; to secure their fundamental rights and freedoms: and towork towards the realisation for them of United Kingdom standards ofliving, employment and social conditions.(b) Those who live in Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom havean obligation to respect the decisions of the Crown in Parliament and toplay their part in creating and in upholding an equitable political settle-men t.(c) Those, both in Northern Ireland and outside it, who wish to see the achievement of Irish unity, which can only be on a basis of consent, havean obligation to accept that such consent does not at present exist, and without prejudice to their aspirations- to assist in the achievement on a constitutional basis of peace, equality and prosperity.13. Any significant advance towards a settlement in Northern Ireland atthis stage must be consistent with this pattern of obligations. In deciding whatthe shape of a settlement should be, the United Kingdom Government hasrefrained from seeking to impose on Northern Ireland a rigidly defined and detailed scheme for its future which could not be done at the present time without assumptions about the wishes of its people. This approach requires that no interest in Northern Ireland should refuse constructive co-operation in working out the details of such a scheme. The United Kingdom Governmentfor its part must have regard to the interests of all the peoples in the UnitedKingdom and of the communities in Northern Ireland. All these interests mustbe brought as nearly as possible into a state of reconciliation. The true interestsof the whole community in Northern Ireland require that the majority shouldnot fail in fairness and generosity towards all their fellow citizens and that the minority should play a truly constructive part which it is the United kingdom governments firm determination should be made available to them.14. The need for movement towards a settlement cannot be divorced fromwider considerations. At a time when new opportunities and new challenges areposed by membership of the European Economic Communities, no area let alone an area with special economic and social problems can afford to behandicapped by continuing strife and instability. The results of failure would not
be confined to Northern Ireland. The heavy burden upon the whole UnitedKingdom is self-evident; and Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland havean obvious common interest in finding a basis for their relationship that will encourage the democratic forces in the whole island. Terrorism is a danger tothem both.15. In determining the broad nature of a settlement, it has to be constantlyborne in mind that the situation in Northern Ireland is complex. constitutional proposals clearly have a significant part to play in the restoration of stability,because the institutions of government touch at one point or another the lives of all the people, and condition wider attitudes towards authority. Moreover,in Northern Ireland the clash of national aspirations heightens interest in, andconcern about, the machinery of government. Yet the problems extend in one way or another into countless aspects of the life of the community into patterns of education, housing and employment; into general social attitudes and re-sponses; into history and culture and tradition. Thus, the solution to &quot;TheNorthern Ireland problem&quot; is not to be found in any set of political proposalsor institutions alone. However skilfully and fairly framed, these can do no more than provide opportunities which the people of Northern Ireland them-selves may take or fail to take; and even with the utmost goodwill, the patterns of generations cannot be changed overnight.16. It would be impossible to devise a prescription for all the problems ofNorthern Ireland during a twelve-month period of &quot;direct rule&quot;. Many of the steps which remain to be taken will be for new Northern Ireland institutions,and many more will be outside the field of government altogether. There cannotbe a &quot;governmental settlement&quot;, only a &quot;community settlement&quot;; and its fullachievement will be a matter of years. What can be done is to make a good start;to set off in the right direction.The problem of violence17. There has been, and remains, no more urgent or compelling task than tobring the present state of violence to an end. Much progress has been made incombating the IRA terrorist campaign, and at the same time, the activitiesof Protestant extremists, both by the normal processes of the criminal law andby the provisions of the Detention of Terrorists Order. The Army will remain for so long and in such strength as the situation requires, but it is vitally important to strengthen the police and to improve their numbers, equipment andtraining. The progress which has already been made is shown by the increasing number of arrests and convictions. In addition, continued and effective actionagainst the terrorists has been, and will be, sought from the Government of theRepublic of Ireland.18. But law and order cannot be restored merely by the action of the security forces. In the United Kingdom, the maintenance of the peace is a responsibility which rests not upon Government alone but upon every citizen. The role of thepolice is traditionally to assist the community; but they can only do so if thecommunity itself accepts responsibility for upholding the law and, at the sametime, gives its full co-operation to the police. Where an absence of publicco-operation makes police work difficult or impossible, countess evils flourish.
The great majority of the people neither like these developments nor have anysay in relation to them, but fear and intimidation cause the communities to consolidate themselves. The ignorance, suspicion, fear and even hatred of the&quot;other side&quot; is, amongst many in those areas, intense; and those who wish tosee mutual tolerance are prevented by intimidation from making their viewsknown. Inroads can only be made into this situation of chronic mistrust andsuspicion by a restoration of law and order and this is a central problem which must be, and will be, solved.19. Under the scheme of devolution proposed in this White Paper, theresponsibility for the security of Northern Ireland in the existing circumstances will continue to rest with the United Kingdom Government. Because this white Paper is principally concerned with the future arrangements for govern-ment in Northern Ireland, this is not the place to develop in detail the means by which the pressing law and order problems are to be tackled. But the peopleof Northern Ireland, and indeed of the United Kingdom as a whole, can restassured that there is no purpose to which Government is more firmly committedthan the restoration of the rule of law in Northern Ireland, and whatevermeans are necessary to that end will be made available.Education20. The re-creation of inter-communal confidence is bound to be a long andslow affair. There is no single means by which it can be accomplished. But theGovernment is convinced that, if tragic events such as these are not to recur,means must be found to create a greater sense of community in the minds of the rising generation. One of the obvious factors in the situation is thehigh degree of educational segregation. This is not of itself in any way peculiar to Northern Ireland. The importance which, in the United Kingdom and inmany other countries, certain of the Churches place upon their own schoolsystems stems from deep conviction about the need for an underlying religiousbasis to all teaching. While, in Northern Ireland, it is the Roman catholic church which maintains a separate system, it is by no means to be assumed that, in practice, all Protestant parents would be happy to see a completelyintegrated school system, involving as it would the teaching of Protestantchildren by Roman Catholic teachers, some of them members of religious orders.To make the educational system itself the scapegoat for all the ills of NorthernIreland would obscure problems whose origins are of a much more complexcharacter.21. There are, however, some encouraging indications of a new consciousnessof the need to promote real and continuing points of contact and mutual interestbetween all the children of Northern Ireland. It is significant that the five newEducation Area Boards will include representatives of &quot;maintained&quot; (largelyRoman Catholic) schools as well as &quot;transferred&quot; (largely Protestant) schoolsas full members of these education authorities, together with representatives ofthe teaching profession, libraries and school trustees, drawn from all sectionsof the community. It will be a vital task of government in the future to facilitate,to encourage and to promote these points of contact. Unless, in the future, agreater sense of community can be fostered amongst the young people ofNorthern Ireland, it is difficult to see how this mutual distrust can be broken down.
Economic Problems22. With its comparative remoteness from its principal markets, its lack ofraw materials (except in agriculture) and its considerable concentration ofemployment in industries which have had special difficulties, Northern ireland has had to make immense efforts to maintain its employment position, let alone to improve it. A skilfully and vigorously conducted programme of indus-trial development, relying heavily on external investment, has achieved a markeddiversification of the industrial base, a steady rise in productivity, and realincreases in living standards. By these standards Northern Ireland has somesubstantial economic achievements to its credit.23. In comparative terms, however, Northern Ireland has remained the poorest region of the United Kingdom, with the highest levels of unemploy-ment. Moreover, within Northern Ireland itself there have been areas of much higher unemployment, both within Belfast and in provincial towns. This hasclearly been a factor in the violence and instability of recent years.24. Thus, the problem is both to raise the level of economic activity overall,and to ensure its more even distribution over the community, to the extent that this is compatible with the physical, economic and industrial realities.25. It is the policy of the United Kingdom Government to work within theEuropean Economic Community for the development of effective regional policies, conducted both by national governments and by Community institu-tions. These policies will provide the broad economic framework within whichthe special problems of Northern Ireland can be tackled by the United KingdomGovernment and the institutions of Northern Ireland working and planningtogether.Social Problems26. In many respects Northern Ireland is most fortunate: its relatively un-spoiled countryside and its uncluttered roads should again be an attractiveregional and national asset once stability has been restored. But there is muchthoroughly inadequate housing, which must be replaced, and in Belfast andcertain other places there is a serious lack of amenities.27. Northern Ireland is by no means unique in this respect, either in theUnited Kingdom or elsewhere. In part it provides simply one example of thecommon errors of post-war development. The phenomenon of the vast housingestates at the furthest reach of public transport, functionally adequate in termsof accommodation but in every other respect soulless and unattractive, and with little or no facilities for social or communal activities, is all too well known.In any part of the world, such communities breed boredom, aimlessness,alienation from society, vandalism and even violence. In Northern Ireland allthese evils may be compounded by high unemployment and deep politicalresentments. The need is to create a positive community life in such areas; todo everything possible to provide other outlets than violence for the energies ofthe people; to demonstrate that authority can be a helpful as well as a coerciveinfluence on their lives.28. These then are the fundamental problems in Northern Ireland. It is against this background that the Governments constitutional proposals must beconsidered.
Part 3THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROPOSALS29. This Part sets out the proposals which the Government will bring beforeParliament at an early date.Renewal of Temporary Provisions30. The Government^ proposals will involve the presentation to Parliamentof a comprehensive new constitutional Bill for the government of NorthernIreland, to replace the arrangements temporarily set aside by direct rule, whichwere based mainly upon the Government of Ireland Act 1920. The Governmentis seeking the approval of Parliament for the extension of the provisions of theNorthern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972 for a further period of oneyear from its expiry date at the end of March, but the subsequent constitutionalBill will provide that the new permanent arrangements may be brought intooperation, and the temporary provisions superseded, and it is the intention that this should be done as soon as possible.Northern Ireland Bill31. Consistent with thorough scrutiny, the Government will seek theassistance of members of both Houses in devising a programme which will permit its passing into law without undue delay so as to allow elections to an assembly to be held as soon as possible. Paragraphs (00) to (;;) below describe the following main provisions which it is intended should be contained in the Bill.Constitutional status of Northern Ireland32. Because the Bill will provide for the replacement of the Parliament ofNorthern Ireland by new institutions, the declaratory provision relating to northern Ireland&apos;s constitutional status incorporated in Section 1(2) of the Ireland Act 1949, to the effect that in no event will Northern Ireland or anypart thereof cease to be part of the United Kingdom without the consent of the parliament of Northern Ireland, will need to be replaced. Successive UnitedKingdom Governments have assured the people of Northern Ireland that therewould be no change in the basic constitutional status of the Province as partof the United Kingdom without their consent, and accordingly other meansmust be found to give expression to that commitment.33. In conformity with those commitments, the Bill will include a statutorydeclaration that Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom, andwill not cease to be part of the United Kingdom without the consent of thepeople of Northern Ireland.Devolution of powers to Northern Ireland institutions34. The process of devolution will involve the following stages:(a) election of a new Northern Ireland Assembly;(b) development by that Assembly of its own rules and procedures in accord-ance with broad provisions laid down in the Bill;
(c) discussion between representatives of the Assembly and the Secretary ofState to arrive at an acceptable basis for the devolution of powers;followed by(d) devolution of powers to the new Assembly and Executive, and terminationof the present direct rule arrangements.A Northern Ireland Assembly35. The first necessary step is to create a representative forum of NorthernIreland opinion. The Parliament of Northern Ireland elected in February 1969and prorogued in March 1972 can no longer be regarded with confidence assuch a forum. The significant developments since 1969, both in the generalsituation and in the structure and organisation of parties, have totally changed the political scene. The need for new elections is widely acknowledged through-out the Northern Ireland community.36. It has been argued that such elections should be to a purely consultative assembly, with which the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland should undertake a further round of consultations before any specific constitutional proposals are formulated. But Northern Ireland has been the focus of specula-tion and uncertainty for a prolonged period already, and there can be little doubt that as long as such uncertainty continues to exist, it will be exploitedby those who seek to prey upon the fears of the communities.37. For this reason the Government has decided not to propose a consultative assembly. This, however, by no means rules out the possibility indeed thenecessity of associating the elected representatives of the people of NorthernIreland with the detailed working-out of those new structures which they willsubsequently operate. The legislative and other procedures to be used in an assembly, to take but one example, would best be formulated in detail by itsown members; and, more generally, there are the strongest arguments forgenuine local involvement, within a framework which effectively safeguardsvital principles.38. Most of the Northern Ireland parties have argued for a single-chamberlegislature and, taking this into account, together with the new responsibilitiesfalling upon central government under the &quot;Macrory&quot; reorganisation and thedesirability of operating a highly developed system of committees, have recom-mended a membership of about 80-100. The Government agrees with this view as to size, but such an increase in membership over the 52 seats of the NorthernIreland House of Commons involves either drawing a new pattern of con-stituencies or adopting a multi-member system tied to an existing pattern of electoral boundaries.39. Any process of establishing a new pattern of single-member constituenciescould not properly begin until Parliament had enacted the constitutional Bill.Under the simple majoiity vote system using single-member constituencies, the drawing of demonstrably fair electoral boundaries is of such crucial importance that it would only be done by an impartial Boundary Commission procedure,with provision for representations, hearings, etc. This would rule out any electionsthis year. These are technical difficulties. But there are arguments against this
system at present even if it could be introduced in time. If the Assembly is toplay a significant part in working out new structures and procedures, it is ofparticular importance that its membership should reflect the wishes of thecommunity as accurately as possible. Accordingly, it has been decided that thereshall be an Assembly of about 80 members, each of whom will receive a salary of  2,500 per annum together with a secretarial allowance of  600 per annum;the members will be elected on this occasion by the single transferable vote(STV) method of proportional representation, applied to the 12 Westminsterconstituencies.40. Elections to the Assembly will be held as soon as practicable on a date tobe prescribed by Order by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.41. The initial term of the Assembly will be for the period from the first dayof its meeting up to and including 30 March 1974; but if an Order-in-council has been made between those dates for the devolution of legislative powers, itwill serve for a period of five years from the first day of its meeting, unless soonerdissolved. The five-year rule will also apply to future assemblies, except in thecase of prior dissolution. A resolution of the Assembly will be effected by the queen in Council where Her Majesty is satisfied on the advice of United King-dom Ministers that a dissolution is expedient in the circumstances obtainingat the time. A relevant circumstance would be if the Assembly were by resolution to recommend that it should be dissolved.42. It will be for the Assembly to elect its presiding officer and to prepareStanding Orders for the regulation of its own business, including the proceduresto apply to the conduct of its legislative business when legislative powers aredevolved to it.43. The Government believes it to be right that the Assembly itself should work out its own detailed methods and procedures, subject to the minimum necessary statutory provision, to permit, for example, both general debate withan opportunity to vote on the general principle of legislative proposals, and detailed consideration and scrutiny, and an opportunity to vote on the specificdetail of these proposals.Committees of the Assembly44. The new scheme for the legislature must be designed to create a stronglink between the Assembly and the Executive, to involve majority and minorityinterests alike in constructive work and to provide for the active participation of all members. It is envisaged that a member of the Assembly will act as the headof each functional Department of Northern Ireland (see paragraph 00), and theresponsibility of such heads will be to administer those Departments within the framework of existing law and policy. But provision will also be made for thehead of each Department to be chairman of a functional committee, with amembership reflecting the balance of the parties in the Assembly. He will berequired, when proposing new law or policy to the Executive or Assembly, tobring the members of his committee into the fullest consultation. provision must be made for a &quot;pre-legislation&quot; stage so that detailed proposals for newlaw will be considered by a committee before presentation to the Assembly as awhole. The objective of the new committee structure will be to associate membersof the Assembly with the development of policy, as well as with the review andscrutiny of departmental activities.
45. There will be no obligation upon the Assembly to follow either the procedures used at Westminster or those hitherto used at Stormont. Indeed, itwould be desirable that they should adopt much simpler and less formalprocedures and methods which will also need to take account of the fact that thenew Assembly will be unicameral.46. While the Assembly is undertaking these initial tasks, the Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland will continue to be responsible for all those matters which, before 30 March 1972, were the concern of the Government of NorthernIreland, and laws previously within the field of competence of the NorthernIreland Parliament which are essential during this period will continue to bemade as appropriate by Westminster Act or by Orders-in-Council subject to parliamentary approval at Westminster.Northern Ireland Advisory Commission47. It would be anomalous that, after the people of Northern Ireland haveelected an Assembly to represent them, but before powers have been devolved,the Secretary of State should continue to be advised, in relation to NorthernIreland legislation and generally, by an Advisory Commission detached from theAssembly. Those who have served on the Northern Ireland Commission sinceDirect Rule was introduced have made a signal contribution to the life of thecommunity; but during this interim period, and so as to assist an easy transition,the Secretary of State will ask the present members to make way for elected representatives.Secretary of State for Northern Ireland48. The task of restoring stability and law and order in Northern Ireland is ofsuch importance throughout the United Kingdom that it must for the forseeablefuture be for a member of the United Kingdom Government. There will, there-fore, continue to be a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. His role will naturally be different from what it has been under direct rule during which theSecretary of State has had executive responsibility for the full range of public services. He must, however, continue to have charge of a department, withofficers both in London and in Northern Ireland, so organised as to dischargehis responsibilities both to Parliament and to Northern Ireland itself.49. It is of the greatest importance, in a situation where wide powers are to be devolved upon Northern Ireland institutions and others reserved to parliament and the United Kingdom Government, that the two sets of authorities shouldnot work in separate compartments or to conflicting objectives. The best interestsof the people of Northern Ireland will only be served if, from the start, their duties are regarded as complementary in character.50. Accordingly, the Secretary of State will have the following main areas ofresponsibility in relation to Northern Ireland:(a) He will undertake the necessary consultations with the elected representa-tives of Northern Ireland to determine how an acceptable basis for the devolution of powers may speedily be achieved.(b) Thereafter, he will exercise direct ministerial responsibility in relation tocertain reserved services administeied eithei by his own department or,where appropriate, by Northern Ireland departments acting as his agents.
(c) He will represent Northern IrelancTs interests in the United KingdomGovernment, both generally and in relation to the allocation of financial resources to Northern Ireland.Conditions for devolution of powers51. As soon as the Assembly has been elected, the Secretary of State will discuss with representatives of the parties how devolution on a basis of govern-ment by consent may take place. Hitherto, the executive dispositions in NorthernIreland have been made by the Governor under the Act of 1920 and in accordancewith the current British constitutional conventions. But those conventionshave been applied to Northern Ireland in a situation where(a) the same party has been the majority party after each General Election;and(b) that party has never returned to Parliament in the course of half a centurya member from the minority community which comprises more than a third of the population.It is from this situation that there flows the problem, as described in the paper for Discussion, of &quot;binding the minority to the support of new political arrange-ments in Northern Ireland&quot;.Formation of the Executive52. There is no future for devolved institutions of government in NorthernIreland unless majority and minority alike can be so bound. This is not to saythat any &quot;right of veto&quot; can be conceded to violent, subversive or unconstructiveelements determined, if they can, to undermine any new system from the outset.But the Government does not believe that this is the wish of the overwhelming majority in either community. What has to be found through their representa-tives is a system of exercising executive power in Northern Ireland which is broadly acceptable to them. One important means of ensuring this will be more effective participation by the Assembly as a whole, through its structure of committees, in the development of policy; but it is the view of the Governmentthat the Executive itself can no longer be solely based upon any single party,if that party draws its support and its elected representation virtually jmientirely from only one section of a divided community. Nor can the Executiveinclude representatives of organisations whose objectives are to subvert theconstitution by violent means.53. It is this central issue which, after the election of the Assembly, theSecretary of State will urgently discuss with its elected leaders. The objective of the discussions will be to seek an agreed understanding which the UnitedKingdom Government can with confidence recommend&quot; to Parliament as afair and viable basis for the devolution of power. When the Government is satisfied:(a) that the procedures of the Assembly and the proposed method of exercisingexecutive powers will, taken together, be a reasonable basis for theestablishment of government by consent (that is to say, with substantiallywider support from the community as a whole than would necessarily be indicated by a simple majority in the Assembly);
(b) in particular, that executive powers will not be concentrated in elected representatives from one community only; and(c) that any proposed arrangements will represent not just a theoreticalframework for fair and acceptable government, but a system which can and will be worked effectively by those concerned,they will seek the approval of Parliament for the devolution by subordinateinstrument of extensive law-making powers to the Assembly, and for a broadlycorresponding devolution of executive powers to a Northern Ireland Executive,which will be constituted in accordance with the arrangements that have beenagreed.Legislative powers54. Whatever powers to legislate may be devolved upon a regional law-makingauthority in Northern Ireland, it must and will be made clear that such devolution-tion does not diminish in any way the right of the United Kingdom Parliamentto legislate for Northern Ireland, as for any other part of the United Kingdom,in relation to any matter whatever. In practice, it is to be expected that, in the context of an acceptable and smooth-running scheme of devolution, parliament would legislate for Northern Ireland within the field of wholly devolved powersonly in the most rare and exceptional circumstances or at the request of theNorthern Ireland Executive; but there can be no room for ambiguity about theright to do so.55. In considering the scheme for the devolution of law-making powers, full advantage can be taken of the difficulties experienced in operating the Act of1920. In order to keep the 1920 constitution operating in the face of changing circumstances, numerous constitutional amendments, enablements and savingshad to be made. Difficult questions arose about the constitutional competence of the Northern Ireland Parliament to legislate, which had to be determinedby the courts. Artificial drafting contrivances had to be used to prevent a specific &quot;invasion&quot; by Westminster of a field transferred to Stormont fromdebarring any future Stormont legislation in that field. What is required for thefuture is a more flexible scheme which will allow Northern Ireland measures,subject to appropriate ministerial and in suitable cases parliamentary scrutiny,to have when finally approved the same force as an Act of Parliament, and alike freedom from questioning, as distinct from interpretation, by the courts(save in the special case of measures alleged to be of a discriminatory character).56. The scheme which is now proposed will have the following features:(a) &quot;Excepted&quot; matters (i.e. those in respect of the substance of which theAssembly may not in any circumstances legislate).Within this category will be various matters of national importanceinappropriate for consideration other than by Parliament, e.g. the Crown,foreign affairs, the Armed Forces and honours and titles. These have always been outside the competence of the Northern Ireland Parliament.To this category will be added a further list of matters in respect of whichthe Northern Ireland Parliament has hitherto had some degree of legis-lative power but which are now considered appropriate for permanentexclusion from the Assembly&apos;s law making powers. These will include certain powers of taxation, special powers of the kind hitherto taken
under the Special Powers Act, elections and the franchise and the appoint-ment of Magistrates and Judges.(b) &quot;Reserved&quot; matters (i.e. those excluded for the present from the normallegislative competence of the Assembly but in respect of which theAssembly may exceptionally legislate with the agreement of the UnitedKingdom Government.Within this category will be certain matters within the field of law andorder, including the criminal law, the courts, penal institutions and theestablishment and organisation of the police.(c) &quot;Transferred&quot; matters (i.e. all other matters not covered in category (a)and (b) above and in respect of which the Assembly will have unrestrictedcompetence to legislate).57. All measures passed by the Assembly will have the force of law whenapproved by the Queen in Council and the channel for submission to the privy council will be the Secretary of State. If he is of opinion that any measureeither deals in substance with a &quot;reserved&quot; matter, or touches incidentally onan &quot;excepted&quot; matter, he will cause it to be laid before Parliament togetherwith his recommendations relating to it, so that an opportunity will be offered for the will of Parliament to be made known. If, however, he is of the opinionthat the measure relates solely to a &quot;transferred&quot; matter, he will cause it to besubmitted directly to the Privy Council.Legislation to deal with violence and subversion58. Following the publication of the Report of the Diplock Commission(Cmnd. 5185), which conclusively showed how terrorism strikes at the root ofthe fundamental freedom to live in peace and, by fear and intimidation, impedesthe ordinary machinery of justice in dealing effectively with it, the government believes it has a responsibility to bring before Parliament necessary provisions for the more effective combatting of terror and violence. Parliament will beasked to approve legislation for that purpose.59. This legislation will give effect to the recommendations of the DiplockCommission for improving the administration of justice at times when it is putunder strain by the effects of terrorism. The provisions would have effect only when Parliament agreed that hey were necessary in the thencurrentcircumstancesin Northern Ireland.60. The Bill will also contain proposals based on the results of the Govern-menfs review of the Special Powers Act. That Act and the Regulations madeunder it were created at varying times to deal with problems then current.They are open to the criticism, above all, that, in spite of their far-reachingcharacter, no provision has existed for their regular review to see whether they remained justified by the special needs of the situation. The Bill will propose the repeal of the Special Powers Act and the re-enactment into law only ofstrictly necessary provisions which, like those provisions implementing theDiplock report, will be operative only during an emergency.61. The procedures for detention are at present contained in The detention of Terrorists (Northern Ireland) Order 1972, which was introduced as an interim
measure pending the Report of the Diplock Commission. That Report made itclear that so long as intimidation continued some such form of detention wouldbe necessary. The new Bill described above will, therefore, make provision fordetention, as at present laid down in the Order, but, like the other provisions in the Bill, it will remain operative only while the situation in Northern Irelandrequires it.62. All the provisions in the Bill will apply only to Northern Ireland, since they arise entirely out of the special needs of the situation there.Restraints upon Devolved Legislative Powers63. The constitutional Bill will include a general provision to the effect that, inthe exercise of any responsibilities devolved upon it, the Northern ireland assembly shall not have power to make any law of a discriminatory character.This is one component of a complex of proposals designed to afford protectionsand safeguards of a &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; character. This subject is comprehensivelydiscussed in Part 4.64. The Bill will also provide that, in the exercise of powers devolved upon it,the Assembly may not impose upon any candidate for election, upon anymember of an elected or appointed body, or upon any person paid out ofpublic funds in Northern Ireland, as a condition of his candidature, election,appointment, service or employment, any requirement to make any form ofoath or declaration save when such an oath or declaration is required incomparable circumstances in England. In the meantime, a draft Order-in-Council under the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972 will beprepared, amending existing Northern Ireland legislation so as to bring it inthis respect into line with that in the rest of the United Kingdom; in particular,it will remove, in time for the forthcoming local government elections, the requirement for a statutory declaration of allegiance to be made by a Councilloron acceptance of office. The Government, however, consider it appropriate that members of the Northern Ireland Assembly itself, should take the same oathas Members of Parliament at Westminster and the Bill will so provide.Executive powers65. As already described, the scheme of legislative powers will be of a flexiblecharacter. It is, however, not possible to provide for the same degree of flexibility in the exercise of executive powers, since it must be clear beyond doubt preciselywhere ministerial responsibility lies in respect of any matter. It must lie either with the United Kingdom Government through one of its Ministers or withthe Northern Ireland Executive through the political head of one of its Depart-ments. But if ministerial responsibility does not permit of a flexible approach,administration certainly does so. To reserve a responsibility to a UnitedKingdom Minister, either permanently or for the time being, is by no means to stand in the way of a high degree of local involvement in administration,through an agency arrangement for the performance of functions by a NorthernIreland Department, or the allocation of advisory or managerial responsibilities to elected or statutory bodies in Northern Ireland, or in other ways.66. Those functions of the United Kingdom Government in NorthernIreland which under direct rule have been the responsibility of United Kingdom
Ministers other than the Secretary of State, such as the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretary of State for Defence, will remain so; in addition,Ministerial responsibility for matters of court administration (including courtspreviously administered by the Government of Northern Ireland) will be vested in the Secretary of State.67. The general intention in the devolution of executive powers will be totransfer to the Northern Ireland Executive those responsibilities exercisedbefore direct rule by the Government of Northern Ireland with the followingprincipal exceptions:(a) responsibility for the appointment of county court judges, magistrates,coroners and a limited number of other appointments of a quasi-judicialnature will be reserved to the Lord Chancellor; and responsibility forthe administration of the courts and tribunals in question will be reserved to the Secretary of State;(b) ministerial responsibility for the conduct of public prosecutions willremain vested in the Attorney-General.Hitherto there has been a division of responsibility, in that the LordChancellor has made appointments to the Supreme Court of NorthernIreland and has been answerable to Parliament for the administration ofthat Court, whereas other judges, magistrates, coroners and members ofvarious quasi-judicial tribunals have been appointed by Northern ireland ministers, who have been responsible to the Northern Ireland parliament for the administration of these courts and tribunals. It is the view of theGovernment that judicial appointments at every level should be made, asin the rest of the United Kingdom, by or on the recommendation of theLord Chancellor, and that there should be a unified administration of thecourts for which the Secretary of State should be answerable to Parliament.In addition, the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland must remain responsible to the Attorney-General in the United KingdomGovernment.(c) ministerial responsibility for all matters connected with elections or the franchise will be reserved to the Secretary of State.The Government believes that, as a matter of principle, Ministers shouldbe answerable to Parliament for arrangements for central and localgovernment elections in Northern Ireland as in other parts of the UnitedKingdom, but the detailed arrangements for such elections in NorthernIreland will continue to be made by an independent statutory officer, theChief Electoral Officer, and his staff.(d) ministerial powers under any legislation empowering the executive totake exceptional measures in the law and order field to cope with anemergency situation (e.g. the legislation to replace the Special Powers Act).68. Certain other powers previously exercised by the Northern ireland government and Ministers will be reserved to the United Kingdom Governmentand Ministers because of the current security situation in Northern Ireland,and accotdingly will not be devolved in present circumstances.(a) ministerial powers in relation to the police will be reserved to the Secretaryof State;
(b) ministerial powers under any legislation concerned with &quot;public order&quot;(e.g. control of unlawful assemblies, offences involving riot, injury orintimidation, and the control of firearms and explosives) will be reserved to the Secretary of State, as will ministerial responsibility in connectionwith the Royal Prerogative of Mercy;(c) ministerial powers under any legislation concerned with penal establish-ments and the treatment of persons in custody will be reserved to theSecretary of State.Law and Order69. The reservation of broad &quot;law and order&quot; powers for the time being mustnot exclude Northern Ireland involvement in matters of great concern to its people; and, indeed, many of the practical problems in relation to policingand other matters cannot be solved without a high degree of public co-operation and goodwill. This interest will be fully acknowledged in the new structure in anumber of ways. First, the Northern Ireland Executive will be invited to actas an advisory committee to the Secretary of State in relation to the whole range of responsibilities reserved to him. He will therefore have an opportunity todiscuss matters of general public concern and interest with the elected leadersof the Northern Ireland community, and to take their views fully into account.Indeed a constructive two-way relationship over the whole range of responsi-bilities, transferred and reserved, is essential if the full practical benefits of thenew constitutional structure are to be realised.70. Second, democratic participation in restoring to all parts of NorthernIreland the full benefits of a normal police service is essential. The police authority, which will continue to have a statutory responsibility for management of the police service, will be re-constituted following consultations with theAssembly so as to introduce into it an element drawn from elected representa-tives. In addition, the new District Councils which will come into being inOctober, will be able to form the basis of local committees with advisoryresponsibilities in relation to the policing of their districts. They could, forexample, invite the local police commander to attend meetings so that theycould keep themselves informed of the way their District was being policed;they could explain problems and put forward suggestions; they could offeradvice; they could help to promote recruitment; they could encourage localcitizens to help prevent intimidation, vandalism, etc.; they could provide links with tenants&apos; associations and other groups whose co-operation was important to good relations in the district; and they could take special interest in suchmatters as road traffic and road safety.Transferred executive powers71. All other powers previously exercised by the Government and Ministers ofNorthern Ireland which include such matters as the health service, social benefits and welfare, employment and training, education, agriculture, industrialdevelopment and the planning and development of the regional infrastructure,will be available for devolution to a Northern Ireland Executive. Broadly theseamount to all the powers hitherto exercised through the existing NorthernIreland Departments except those in the law and order field.
Appointment of Heads of Departments.72. The constitutional Bill will provide that the Secretary of State may appoint persons to be the political Heads of Departments in Northern ireland for the purpose of administering services under the devolved executive powers.These Departments will include a central secretariat whose political Head will lead the Assembly and preside over the Executive. This is a power of appoint-ment analagous with that conferred upon the Governor by Section 8 of theGovernment of Ireland Act 1920, but when an agreed understanding on theformation of an Executive is reached in discussion with elected representatives,it would be the intention to make appointments in accordance with thatunderstanding.73. Collectively, the Heads of Departments will form a body to co-coordinate the policies and activities of the administration as a whole, and to determinefinancial and other priorities. This body will constitute the Executive of NorthernIreland. The Heads of Departments and the Head of the central secretariatwill receive a salary in addition to those they receive as Members of the Assembly.Powers to fix or vary these salaries will be vested in the Assembly which will beexpected to take into account arrangements of the independent review ofpublic service salaries within the United Kingdom as a whole.74. Devolved services will continue to be administered by the establishedDepartments of the Government of Northern Ireland and services not devolvedcan, in suitable cases, be performed by a Northern Ireland Department on an agency basis. It is not the intention of the Government so to integrate theadministration of services not devolved for the time being with their administration in Great Britain that they cannot, at some later appropriate stage and with theapproval of Parliament, be devolved to Northern Ireland institutions. Some ofthe services concerned, for example in the penal field, must in practice be closely co-ordinated with other social services, and in such cases the argument for an agency arrangement is strong. In other cases, the service may be more appropriately administered by the Secretary of State&apos;s Office in NorthernIreland, but arrangements can be made for secondment to that Office of suitableNorthern Ireland officials.75. Existing powers under Northern Ireland law to make Transfer of Func-tions Orders should be adequate to cope with any departmental re-organisation in Northern Ireland which the Executive and Assembly consider desirableafter the new arrangements take effect; and, of course, the powers of theNorthern Ireland Assembly would include the power to legislate for depart-mental organisation.The Civil Service of Northern Ireland76. The Civil Service of Northern Ireland will remain a distinct service underthe Crown. Since the broad pattern of services to be carried out in NorthernIreland, whether under devolved institutions or otherwise, will remain the same,its officers need not fear any deterioration in their career prospects or conditionsof service. It will, however, be the concern of the Government to ensure that,even in isolated individual cases, the interests of members of the Northern
Ireland Civil Service are fully protected. Throughout the crises and upheavalsof recent years their loyalty to the Crown and to the concept of service whichthey share with their United Kingdom colleagues has been a vital stabilisingfactor in a difficult situation. They have continued to operate, under whateverministerial direction the law provided, those services upon which the life ofthe community depends.Restraints upon executive powers77. The Bill will provide that, in the exercise of devolved executive powers,no Department of Northern Ireland may act in a discriminatory way. Thisstatutory bar to any form of discriminatory action will also apply to any authority, body or agency in Northern Ireland which is subject to investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, the Northern IrelandParliamentary Commissioner for Administration, or the Northern IrelandCommissioner of Complaints, and to the Post Office.Replacement of existing institutions and constitutional provisions78. Under the new arrangements the Northern Ireland Assembly will replace the Parliament of Northern Ireland. A proper acknowledgement is due to thework of that Parliament and its Members and Senators. The pension rights ofmembers of the Northern Ireland Parliament will be safeguarded.79. It has always been the case, at Stormont as at Westminster, that Parlia-ment has sought to make appropriate pension provision, by specific legislation,foi any person who has served in the office of Speaker of the House of Commons.The Secretary of State will in due course seek the approval of Parliament forsuch provision as the Parliament of Northern Ireland would undoubtedly havemade for the present Speaker.80. Due regard must also be had to the interests of the career officers ofParliament, the Clerk of Parliaments and his staff. While the new Assemblymust obviously be free to make its own dispositions in this respect, it will nodoubt wish to make full use of the expertise which exists amongst these pro-fessional servants of Parliament. At all events, their interests must and will be fully protected.Executive powers of the Governor81. Certain of the functions hitherto performed by the Governor will undeithe settlement be carried out by the United Kingdom Government or the queen in Council. The executive powers of the Governor of Northern Irelandare therefore incompatible with the new constitutional scheme. There will,however, be no weakening whatever in Northern Ireland&apos;s links with the Crown.Her Majesty remains Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain andNorthern Ireland; all executive power, in Northern Ireland as elsewhere in theUnited Kingdom, will continue to flow from Her. H.M. Government paystribute to the present Governor, Lord Grey of Naunton and Lady Grey forthe outstanding service they have given to Northern Ireland during a most difficult period.Northern Ireland Privy Council82. No further appointments to the Privy Council of Northern Ireland, orto its Executive Committee (the Cabinet of Northern Ireland) will be made;
but existing members of the Privy Council will retain their existing rank andstyle and obligations. Alternative arrangements will be made for the perfor-mance of those acts principally the making of Orders which various statutesrequire to be done in Council. Hitherto, Ministers of Northern Ireland, in protecting the confidentiality of Cabinet and other business, have been bound by the Privy Counsellors Oath; for the future, all persons discharging executive responsibilities in Northern Ireland, including the Heads of Departments, willbe bound by the Official Secrets Act. It would be right for those who havethe custody of the records of the Executive Committee to apply to them the criteria accepted in the United Kingdom on a change of Administration; thatis to say, records may be consulted by those who were present at particularmeetings, but will not be made available to an incoming Administration.Financial Arrangements83. The broad scheme of the financial provisions, which will be considerablysimpler in form than those in the Act of 1920, will be as follows:(a) The Northern Ireland Assembly will not have power to legislate in thefield of taxation with the exception of those taxes such as rates and licencefees for which the agieement of the United Kingdom Government hasbeen given for legislation by the Northern Ireland Assembly;(b) aftet devolution of powers, the revenue required to meet the cost ofdevolved services will be derived from the product of taxes levied locally(e.g. the rates); from certain non-tax revenue which accrues locally fromthe yield of the &quot;attributed taxation&quot; of Northern Ireland, to be paid outof the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom into the Exchequer ofNorthern Ireland; supplemented, if necessary, by an annual sum voted tothe Secretary of State for Northein Ireland for that purpose.(c) the existing arrangements will continue for loans from the United KingdomNational Loans Fund to finance capital expenditure programmes inNorthern Ireland.84. There will be some exceptions to this broad scheme. The AgriculturalRemoteness Grant will continue to be paid separately, and arrangements forthe National Insurance, Industrial Injuries and Redundancy payments schemes will be maintained as heretofore (i.e. inter-fund transfers will continue). TheJoint Exchequer Board will be abolished, and no provision will be made in thenew scheme for the payment of an &quot;Imperial Contribution&quot;.85. The financial relationships between the United Kingdom Government andthe Government of Northern Ireland have hitherto been regulated not only by statute but by a whole pattern of agreements, arrangements and understandings.Apart from the broad constitutional provision which must be made, the twosignificant questions to be answered are:(a) if Northern Ireland&apos;s attributed revenue is to be supplemented out ofvoted moneys, how is the need to be measured?(b) what scope is there, in the context of such financial arrangements, for thedevelopment in the Northern Ireland Assembly of the politics of choicesand priorities?
but existing members of the Privy Council will retain their existing rank andstyle and obligations. Alternative arrangements will be made for the perfor-mance of those acts principally the making of Orders which various statutesrequire to be done in Council. Hitherto, Ministers of Northern Ireland, in protecting the confidentiality of Cabinet and other business, have been bound by the Privy Counsellors Oath; for the future, all persons discharging executive responsibilities in Northern Ireland, including the Heads of Departments, willbe bound by the Official Secrets Act. It would be right for those who havethe custody of the records of the Executive Committee to apply to them the criteria accepted in the United Kingdom on a change of Administration; thatis to say, records may be consulted by those who were present at particularmeetings, but will not be made available to an incoming Administration.Financial Arrangements83. The broad scheme of the financial provisions, which will be considerablysimpler in form than those in the Act of 1920, will be as follows:(a) The Northern Ireland Assembly will not have power to legislate in thefield of taxation with the exception of those taxes such as rates and licencefees for which the agieement of the United Kingdom Government hasbeen given for legislation by the Northern Ireland Assembly;(b) after devolution of powers, the revenue required to meet the cost ofdevolved services will be derived from the product of taxes levied locally(e.g. the rates); from certain non-tax revenue which accrues locally fromthe yield of the &quot;attributed taxation&quot; of Northern Ireland, to be paid outof the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom into the Exchequer ofNorthern Ireland; supplemented, if necessary, by an annual sum voted tothe Secretary of State for Northein Ireland for that purpose.(c) the existing arrangements will continue for loans from the United KingdomNational Loans Fund to finance capital expenditure programmes inNorthern Ireland.84. There will be some exceptions to this broad scheme. The AgriculturalRemoteness Grant will continue to be paid separately, and arrangements forthe National Insurance, Industrial Injuries and Redundancy payments schemes will be maintained as heretofore (i.e. inter-fund transfers will continue). TheJoint Exchequer Board will be abolished, and no provision will be made in thenew scheme for the payment of an &quot;Imperial Contribution&quot;.85. The financial relationships between the United Kingdom Government andthe Government of Northern Ireland have hitherto been regulated not only by statute but by a whole pattern of agreements, arrangements and understandings.Apart from the broad constitutional provision which must be made, the twosignificant questions to be answered are:(a) if Northern Ireland&apos;s attributed revenue is to be supplemented out ofvoted moneys, how is the need to be measured ?(b) what scope is there, in the context of such financial arrangements, for thedevelopment in the Northern Ireland Assembly of the politics of choicesand priorities?
86. The Government believes it to be right that the broad objectives by whichthe financial requiiements of Northern Ireland will be judged should be clearly stated. These are:(a) to accomplish as rapidly as possible, once violence has ended, the task of physical reconstruction and rehabilitation created by the disorders ofrecent years;(b) to create a sound base for the economy and to encourage externalindustrial investment;(c) to work progressively towards the achievement in Northern Ireland ofthose standards of living, employment and social conditions which prevailin Great Britain.87. The overall level of public expenditure in Northern Ireland will bedetermined in the light of these objectives and in compatibility with public expenditure policies for the United Kingdom as a whole. The total for NorthernIreland, which will have to be acceptable to the Government and parliament at Westminster, can continue to be settled through the existing arrangements of the Public Expenditure Survey. Within this total, however, Northern Irelandwill enjoy a large measure of freedom of decision as regards its choice of priori-ties and policies in advancing towards the objectives stated above.88. When the new institutions in Northern Ireland have been formed, theGovernment will discuss with them in detail how best to provide such freedom.This will involve a discussion how to divide expenditure (excluding expenditureon law and order, which will be reserved) into two broad categories, the detailsof which will have to be worked out. The first would consist of the cash social services, assistance to industry and employment as well as agriculture andfisheries. For these services certain limitations upon local freedom of decision will be inevitable. In the case of the cash social services, such as family allowances,unemployment and sickness benefit and pensions, it is difficult to envisageanything other than exact parity with Great Britain. In the case of assistance to industry and employment, consultation with the United Kingdom Governmentwill be necessary to ensure that regard is paid to the general industrial and fiscalpolicies of the United Kingdom Government and to the problems of theDevelopment Areas in Great Britain. Moreover, the United Kingdom Govern-ment cannot abrogate responsibility for the application in Northern Irelandof regional policies which will be the subject of negotiation with the european economic Communities in their application to the United Kingdom as a whole.Somewhat similar considerations apply also in the case of policies for agri-culture and fisheries. But the intention will be within agreed guidelines to giveNorthern Ireland the widest possible measure of discretion and latitude inday-to-day operations.89. The second category would embrace all other services, including amongstothers education, health and personal social services, housing, roads, the nationalised fuel industries and local environmental services. These servicesaccount for well over half of Northern Ireland public expenditure. For these services, Northern Ireland would have a high degree of freedom and discretion to determine relative priorities, to reallocate funds from one programme to
another and to pursue distinctive policies different from those obtaining inGreat Britain, provided always that they aie directed towards the broad objec-tives stated in paragraph (00) and that their cost is kept within the annual totalsfor this category of expenditure. Within the Northern Ireland administration the Department of Finance would continue to play an essential role intoco-ordinating and regulating total expenditure and approving individual programmes.
RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE INDIVIDUAL90. Part 4 examines the constitutional proposals from the standpoint of theindividual, and describes how obligations will be established under the settlement.The Requirement91. In any society the average individual, the &quot;man in the street&quot;, is probablyless concerned with the detailed definition of authority and the law than withits effectiveness in ensuring certain basic standards. These may be summarisedas:(a) the right to freedom within the law, including freedom to advance any political or constitutional cause by non-violent means;(o) the right to protection under the law, so that freedom is not taken awayor diminished by violence, oppression or intimidation by others; and(c) the right to equality of benefit and opportunity, so that the state andsociety will deal in an equitable and even-handed way as between onecitizen and another, without bias or prejudice.92. But this pattern of rights has to be matched by a balancing pattern of obligations:(a) freedom to advance one&apos;s own ideas involves a comparable freedom for others to advance theirs, and an acceptance that a minority has no rightto force its views upon a majority, as distinct from seeking to convince them;(b) the right to protection under the law can only be maintained by a willing-ness to observe the law, including laws with which the individual maydisagree, and to support the authorised agencies of law-enforcement;(c) the right to equality of benefit and opportunity is incompatible withabstention, non-participation or the avoidance of such communalobligations as paying, through taxation or otherwise, for public servicesavailable to all.93. A fundamental problem since the earliest years of Northern Ireland&apos;sexistence has been the disagreement not just about how Northern Ireland shouldbe governed, but as to whether it should continue to exist at all. Those inNorthern Ireland who have supported its continued membership of the UnitedKingdom have seen themselves as faced by an unremitting campaign todiscredit and dismantle the constitutional system. Their opponents, on theother hand, have claimed that valid political opposition has been treated assubversion, and used as a pretext to exclude them from any share of real power or influence in Northern Ireland&apos;s affairs.94. The essence of the new constitutional and other arrangements is fairneses;equality of treatment and of opportunity; an absence of discrimination or biasof any sort. Any person in Northern Ireland, whatever his political beliefs,
may advance them peacefully without fear. But no person or organisation can expect to be allowed to claim to be acting politically at one moment and then,given what appears a favourable opportunity, to turn to violence and subversion.Protection of human rights95. The protection of fundamental human rights in Northern Ireland willhenceforth flow from a number of different sources. The principal protection isthat afforded by our parliamentary democratic tradition and by the common andstatute law. In addition, the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, has accepted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the EuropeanConvention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.But because important areas of government will be devolved to subordinateinstitutions, and this involves written constitutional provision, it is practicable to legislate for the protection of human rights in a way which cannot readily be done elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Thus the constitutional Bill willspecifically legislate against any discriminatory use of the Assembly&apos;s law-making powers. The Secretary of State will not recommend Her Majesty inCouncil to give any such proposal the force of law; and even if it were to been acted, its validity could subsequently be considered by the courts.96. These safeguards will be matched by equally stringent checks against any abuse of the executive power. Any action of a discriminatory character bya Government Department, a local authority or a public body could be made thesubject of court action, and the whole range of legal remedies are available tothe litigant.97. Moreover, these specific legislative safeguards are complementary to existing provision in the public sector. In Northern Ireland, as in the rest ofthe United Kingdom, alleged maladministration by Government Departmentscan be investigated by a Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration who in some respects has a wider remit than his United Kingdom counterpart; butin addition Northern Ireland has a unique office that of the Commissioner forComplaints responsible for investigating alleged maladministration (includingdiscriminatory practices) in the public sector outside Government, i.e. localauthorities and public bodies. There will be added to the investigatory agenciesappropriate provisions for the independent investigation of complaints againstthe police to conform with those which the Home Secretary may make inrelation to police forces in England and Wales.98. Every public authority is required to operate under a fair employmentcode; an anti-discrimation clause (policed on an extra-statutory basis by theParliamentary Commissioner for Administration) is written into all Govern-ment contracts, and a breach of its requirements can involve removal for aperiod from the Government contract list; and the allocation of publicly-provided housing, formerly a matter of much controversy in Northern Ireland,is now the responsibility of a central Housing Executive, with a broadly-basedmembership and working to objective criteria.99. A further significant point is that, when on 1 October 1973 the re-organisa-tion of local services associated with the Macrory Report becomes fully effective,the area of public activity outside the control or influence of &quot;central govern-
ment&quot;, as represented either by the Government of the United Kingdom or aNorthern Ireland Executive, will be greatly diminished. (As noted in the paper for Discussion, the preponderant part of complaints of discrimination in thepublic sector was in the past concentrated against certain activities of a relatively few local authorities.) Moreover, the overall nature of the new constitutional arrangements will be a safeguard in itself, for it is inherent in the entire argumentof this White Paper that devolved powers can only be exercised in the futureon a broadly acceptable basis. Taken together, the general form of the settlement and the specific constitutional safeguards incorporated within it should amplyguarantee fair and unbiased law-making and administration.100. In the private sector, the great bulk of criticism and complaint has been about alleged discrimination in private employment. The Government has taken the view that it must proceed in this matter with the goodwill and co-operationof both sides of industry. The record of the Northern Ireland Committee of theIrish Congress of Trade Unions, of the Confederation of British Industries(Northern Ireland Region) and of the Northern Ireland Chamber of commerce and Industry has been one of consistent helpfulness, responsibility and fairness,and accordingly their representatives were invited to join with representativesof Government, under the chairmanship of a Minister of State at the NorthernIreland Office (first Mr. Paul Channon, M.P., and subsequently Mr. Williamvan Straubenzee, M.P.) to consider and report upon the problem. The Secretaryof State has now received from the chairman of the Working Party a letterconveying interim conclusions, which are substantially reproduced in thefollowing paragraphs.101. The Working Party has agreed that its fundamental aim is to promote fullequality in all aspects of employment opportunity within the private sector,and has formed the view that such equality of opportunity requires strictfairness and impartiality in all aspects of recruitment, appointment and promoting-tion procedures including, where necessary, programmes of affirmative actiondesigned to promote such ends. Affirmative action may, for example, includeenlargement of the traditional field of recruitment or other positive steps designedto demonstrate commitment to full equality in employment practice; but itdoes not imply the introduction of a formal quota system.102. With this central objective in mind, the Working Party proposes torecommend three inter-related and mutually reinforcing steps. These are:(a) A Declaration of principle and intent which in the first instance would be signed jointly by representative employer and trade union organisations and then promulgated by them for adoption throughout industry and commerce;(b) The preparation and issue of a Guide to Manpower Policy and Practicebased on manifestly fair principles and sound management procedures,for use by all those concerned with recruitment and employment;(c) The establishment by statute of an Agency with powers both to investigateindividual complaints of unlawful discrimination in employment onreligious or political grounds, which would be made unlawful, and itselfto initiate in certain circumstances inquiries into patterns of employmentin particular companies or industries or among categories of workers.The Working Party envisages that the Agency should discharge animportant advisory and educational role in addition to its functions of
investigation or inquiry. Where it was satisfied on inquiry that an unlawfuldiscriminatory practice existed, the Agency would seek, through con-ciliation and other administrative procedures, to secure voluntarycompliance with the law; but it would be able, as a last resort, to apply tothe courts for a range of civil remedies.103. The Working Party point out in their letter that the representatives ofthe interests cannot bind their organisations, and that full consultation will therefore be essential when the final report is published. Nevertheless, theGovernment regards the interim conclusions of the Working Party as a most significant advance towards effective action in a most important area with theco-operation of responsible organisations in both sides of industry, and, whenthe necessary consultations have been carried out, will propose to Parliamentcomprehensive legislation in this field.104. The assurance of fairness and equality of opportunity, not only inemployment but across the whole field of public and private activity, is not and cannot be secured by the work of any single body or agency. Northern Irelandalready has its Community Relations Commission and its parliamentary commissioner for Administration and Commissioner for Complaints. Now, inaddition, a statutory Agency concerned with fair employment practice is envisaged. If further protections at any time prove to be necessary, the right course could be to modify, adapt or use some of this existing machinery or tocreate new machinery or law. What is important is that there should be effective co-ordination of the activities of all the agencies working in this field, and thatthe United Kingdom Parliament and Government should have a continuousflow of information enabling them to discharge their responsibilities foi human rights in Northern Ireland, as in every other part of the United Kingdom. Tothat end, provision will be made in the constitutional Bill for power for theSecretary of State to appoint a Standing Advisory Commission on human rights for Northern Ireland, charged with the duty of keeping in touch with theactivities of all public agencies active in the field of human rights and of producing an annual report, to be laid both before Parliament and the NorthernIreland Assembly, including recommendations as to any further statutory provision which it considers should be made. The Commission would have a relatively small but high-level membership, including the Chairman of theCommunity Relations Commission and of any fair employment agency, andthe holder or holders of the offices of Parliamentary Commissioner for administration and Commissioner for Complaints.The acceptance of obligations105. If society deals fairly with the individual, it has a right to a reciprocalfairness from him. He has the obligation to bear his share of the collectiveburdens which are a part of civilised life. He cannot continually call for &quot;lawand order&quot;, yet be reluctant to observe laws he dislikes and hostile to those whoprotect public order. He cannot demand every benefit which society can offer,yet fail to play his part in paying for those benefits. Private armies; failure toco-operate with the police by withholding information on violent crime; civildisobedience; rent and rates strikes all of these developments are incompatible with an equitable pattern of rights and obligations as between society and the citizen. A prompt end to these practices is the contribution which the individualcan make to the success of the settlement.
THE IRISH DIMENSION106. When the Paper for Discussion referred to the &quot;Irish dimension&quot; of theNorthern Ireland situation, it was not making a political judgment butacknowledging an evident fact; that Northern Ireland is affected in numerousways by what happens in the Republic of Ireland, and that the reverse is equallytrue.107. At this point it may be appropriate to set out again the conclusions reached in Paragraph 78 of the Paper for Discussion:&quot;Whatever arrangements are made for the future administration of NorthernIreland must take account of the Province&apos;s relationship witth he republic of Ireland: and to the extent that this is done, there is an obligation uponthe Republic to reciprocate. Both the economy and the security of thetwo areas are to some considerable extent inter-dependent, and the sameis true of both in their relationship with Great Britain. It is, therefore,clearly desirable that any new arrangements for Northern Ireland should,whilst meeting the wishes of Northern Ireland and Great Britain, be sofar as possible acceptable to and accepted by the Republic of Ireland,which from 1 January 1973 will share the rights and obligations of membership of the European Communities. It remains the view of theUnited Kingdom Government that it is for the people of Northern ireland to decide what should be their relationship to the United Kingdom and tothe Republic of Ireland; and that it should not be impossible to devisemeasures which will meet the best interests of all three. Such measures would seek to secure the acceptance, in both Northern Ireland and in theRepublic, of the present status of Northern Ireland, and of the possibility which would have to be compatible with the principle of consent of subsequent change in that status to make possible effective consultation and co-operation in Ireland for the benefit of North and South alike; andto provide a firm basis for concerted governmental action against thoseterrorist organisations which represent a threat to free democratic institu-tions in Ireland as a whole.&quot;108. These conclusions received a very general welcome from widely representative spokesmen of political and other interests in the Republic ofIreland. It is now possible to make progress in a way which could significantlyreduce or eliminate any remaining points of friction in the relationship betweenthe peoples of these islands.109. True progress in these matters can only be achieved by consent.Accordingly, following elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly, theGovernment will invite the Government of the Irish Republic and the leadersof the elected representatives of Northern Ireland opinion to participate withthem in a conference to discuss how the three objectives set out in the Paper forDiscussion, that is:(a) the acceptance of the present status of Northern Ireland, and of thepossibility which would have to be compatible with the principle ofconsent of subsequent change in that status;
(b) effective consultation and co-operation in Ireland for the benefit of Northand South alike; and(c) the provision of a firm basis for concerted governmental and communityaction against terrorist organisationsmay best be pursued.110. These objectives are inter-related. If and when firm agreements are reached, consideration can be given to the means by which they should be formally adopted as between sovereign states. But, consistent with the principleof consent, the first stage clearly must be discussions involving all the parties.111. It is noteworthy that virtually all the Northern Ireland political partiesincluded in their proposals some sort of scheme for institutional arrangements between North and South which many described as a &quot;Council of Ireland&quot;,although there were quite different concepts of such a Council, and in some casesan emphasis upon conditions which would have to be met before it could operate successfully.112. The widespread interest which exists in the idea of a Council is a firmbasis for moving to a specific discussion of the matter. There have been arguments that the Government should at this stage, in consultation with the Irish Republic,write into the constitutional Bill for Northern Ireland a complete scheme forsuch a Council. These arguments are, however, unrealistic. If a Council is tobe set up not merely as a statutory concept, but as a useful working mechanismin North-South relations, it must operate with the whole-hearted consent ofboth majority and minority opinion in Northern Ireland, who have a right toprior consultation and involvement in the process of determining its form,functions and procedures.113. As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, it favours and is preparedto facilitate the formation of such a body. The constitutional proposals would permit the new Northern Ireland institutions to consult and co-ordinate actionthrough a Council of Ireland on various economic and social matters.114. Under the proposals of this White Paper, certain important functionsof government in Northern Ireland will be reserved to the United KingdomGovernment rather than devolved to new institutions in Northern Ireland.Some of these relate to matters on which consultation and agreed co-ordinatedaction (e.g. in relation to the suppression of terrorism) is of the first importance,and this will involve consideration as to how the United Kingdom authoritiescan best be associated with discussion of these subjects either within a Councilof Ireland concept or otherwise. Moreover, even within the area of powersdevolved to Northern Ireland institutions, there will often be United kingdom interests or repercussions, relating for instance to the provision of finance from united Kingdom sources or to international obligations, including thosearising from membership of the European Economic Communities. It may besaid that these proposals leave much unresolved; and so they do. But it wouldrequire either exceptional vision or exceptional foolhardiness to forecast thefuture development of relationships involving North and South in Ireland, theUnited Kingdom, and the British Isles and Europe. But there is much which can usefully be done to defeat terrorism by concerted action throughout Ireland,and to serve the economic and social interests of all the people, North and South.
CONCLUSIONS115. Under the settlement, Northern Ireland will continue to have a greaterdegree of self-government than any other part of the United Kingdom. Whilebenefitting in full measure from all the practical advantages of the british connection for the proposals embody political, financial and economic arrangements which are in general both flexible and generous NorthernIreland will continue, to a very large extent, to make its own laws and administerits own services, particularly in relation to such crucial issues as employment,housing, development of the regional infra-structure and education.116. These proposals are designed to benefit the law abiding majority in both communities, who may have conflicting views on the ultimate constitu-tional destiny of Northern Ireland, but who seek to advance those views by peaceful democratic means alone, and have strong mutual interests in makingsocial and economic progress. The proposals provide an opportunity for all such people to stand together against those small but dangerous minoritieswhich would seek to impose their views by violence and coercion, and whichcannot, therefore, be allowed to participate in working institutions they wishto destroy.117. To all those who support the continued union with Great Britain, theproposals offer firm assurances that this union will endure and be defended,for as long as that is the wish of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.They seek to strengthen the democratic institutions of Northern Ireland bywinning for them that wide-ranging consent upon which the government of a free country must rest. They commit the whole United Kingdom to a majoreffort to narrow the gap in standards of living, employment and social con-ditions between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.118. To all those who seek the unification of Ireland by consent, but aregenuinely prepared to work for the welfare of Northern Ireland, the proposalsoffer the opportunity to play no less a part in the life and public affairs ofNorthern Ireland than is open to their fellow citizens.119. To all, whatever their religion or theii political beliefs, the proposalsextend ample protection against any arbitrary or discriminatory use of power.120. These, then, are the Governments proposals to Parliament, to thecountry, and above all to the people of Northern Ireland themselves for a wayforward out of the present violence and instability. At every point, they requirethe co-operation of those people themselves if they are to have any prospect ofsuccess. They can be frustrated if interests in Northern Ireland refuse to allow them to be tried or if any section of the community is determined wholly toimpose its will on another. It should now be perfectly clear that these areprescriptions for disaster. The Government believes, however, that the over-whelming majority of the people of Northern Ireland have a yearning for peace and that they will wish to accept the opportunity which these proposals offer.Their courage and fortitude over the last few years deserve the respect of thenation and the world.
