1fljtS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S government cp(73) 34 COPY NO19 March 1973CABINETREORGANISATION OF THE NUCLEAR DESIGN and construction industry note by the Secretary of State for Trade and industry. I was invited by the Cabinet to initiate negotiations with the GeneralElectric Company (G.C) and the other interests concerned to set up a singleprivate sector nuclear design and construction (d/c) company led by G.C,2.        In addition to G.C I have talked with the Electricity Council, theCentral Electricity Generating Board (CEGB), the United Kingdom atomic energy Authority (ASA), the two existing nuclear d/c consortia and hawker siddeley (Sir Arnold Hall) and British Insulated Callendar Cables (BICC)(Lord McFad^an).3, I outlined to them the alternatives of a G.C majority shareholdingand a G.C minority shareholding coupled with a management agreement which would give G.C full managerial authority,    I explained that under either alternative the company would operate within the Governmentsnuclear strategy, as advised by the Nuclear Power Advisory Board, andthat the Government would have reserved rights to safeguard in particularopen purchasing and international links,    I also explained that we wish tosee participation by other private sector firms in the nuclear business,40 The Electricity Council, the CEGB and the sea confirmed their view that G.C is the only company at present capable of leading the new company.    The electricity authorities want the maximum commitment ofGECs resources.    The sea would prefer a G.C minority share whichthey believe would be more acceptable presentationally to the rest of theindustry.    Most of the other industrial interests are, as expected, uneasyabout control by a single powerful company, but they accept the need forrationalisation of the industry into a single strong company and that thepresent consortium system must go,    In general if the decision is to giveGEC management control they see no advantage from their standpoint inthis being achieved by a minority share supported by a managementagreement (a concept they dislike); they prefer a straight majorityGEC holding.1
5. Other firms1 main concern relates to the purchasing arrangements.They doubt whether an open purchasing policy can be made to workeffecStvely.    They recognise however that this risk is an inescapableconsequence of basing the new company on a stronge unified organisationwhether it be G.C or another company such as BICC.    Moreover the riskcan be mitigated.    In addition to Governments reserved rights and relatedmonitoring arrangements on purchasing policy there will be -a0 The opportunity for other firms to be directly involved inthe company.b. The GEGB&apos;s intention to move away from the turnkeyapproach and to place separate and direct orders forturbogenerators and associated plant.    This would furtherprotect firms such as Reyrolle Parsons, Hawker Siddeleyand BICC.Cc. The CEG3!s and other generating boards&apos; ability to nominate subcontractors for elements cf the nuclear steamsupply system as well.ds In the export field G.C have said that they will be preparedto work in association with eg Reyrolle Parsons in tendering for complete power stations.6. My negotiations with G.C have established -a. Their readiness to take 100 per cent ownership which they themselves, however, regard as politically and industriallyunacceptable.b. Their unwillingness to take a majority interest if other firms are to have a minority share (they fear this could allowobstruction of the management and friction),c. Their wish to have a Government shareholding at least as large as the shareholding of any other firm,7, I have accordingly been negotiating with G.C on the basis thatGFC should hold 50 per cent and Government a minimum of 10 per cent and a maximum of 20 per cent with reserved rights.    I suggest that weproceed on the basis of 15 per cent.    Other firms would be offered thebalance subject to certain conditions including that their shares shouldbe held in a group which might be chaired by someone like Lord McFadzean,The proposed structure is outlined at Annex I.    There would be nomanagement agreement as such but G.C would supervise the subsidiaryoperating company and be paid for services provided,,    G.C agree with me that the board should include leading people from other firms in the nuclear and electrical business including Lord McFadzean and Mr Woodeson(Clarke Chapman/John Thompson Limited).
GUARANTEES80 I propose that all shareholders should initially be asked toparticipate in joint and several guarantees.    Some of them may be unwilling to accept the substantial risks involved, having regard totheir small stake and say in the management, and we may have to reconsider,,    G.C are concerned that some minority shareholderswould be unable to meet their guarantees if called and are taking theline that they cannot be involved beyond their shareholding since the minority industrial shareholdings are at Government^ specific request.On the other hand, while Government should in my view be prepared tocarry some of the cost of default, it may be reasonable for G.C to beara proportion since they have complete management responsibility,,    Thiswill need further negotiation when we ksxow the composition and size of theshareholding of the minority interests, but my colleagues should know thatthe Government may have to underwrite guarantees beyond the size of ourshareholding.9. Discussions with G.C are still continuing and I will report orallyon further developments.    However I believe that we now have the basisof a good solution meeting the requirement for a unified and strongmanagement, Government^ needs on reserved rights and allowingparticipation by other interests.    If my colleagues agree, I wouldaim to make a statement to Parliament in the week beginning 19 Marchoutlining the basis on which the company is to be set up,NUCLEAR POWER ADVISORY BOARD10. CP(73) 15 sought approval to establishing the Nuclear PowerAdvisory Board. For convenience I am attaching again at Annex IIthe note on terms of reference and membership.RECOMMENDATION11*        I seek agreement to:i.

AKK3X   IINUCLEAR TQWR ADVISORY BOARDIntroduction1      On the advice of an Intei&apos;-J5epart:r.entai Official Committee, kodecided last summer (CX(72)40th) that a nuclear Power board should be set up with the responsibility of providing concertedadvice to the Secretary of State -for Trade and Industry on strategy for the uso of nuclear power.   This followed from. our judgement thatthe existing machinery for advice and consultation available to theDepartment of Trade and Industry did not seem adequate to ensurethat Government decisions were based on full consultation with thevarious industrial interests and, in particular, that the consumerinterest of the generating boards was taken into account fit all stages of the development of new nuclear systems.2      The Government&apos;s intention to set up a Board.to this end was announced in the statement on the future of the nuclear industry on8 August 1972.3      The rest of this note sets out briefly my present proposals on  establishing the Board,Name4      The Board is to be a purely advisory body which is not to bebacked by legislation.    It will not have executive functions.   the nuclear Power Advisory Board (NPAB) is the most suitable title for it.
/Terms of reference*5      I propose for the formal terms cf reference:&quot;To provide the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry withcontinuing advice on ail strategic aspects of civil nuclear energy policy.&quot;(On matters of safety of civil installations, I will continueto ho advised and the KPA2 will in future he advised by theChief Inspector of Nuclear Installations and the NuclearSafety Advisory Committee).Within these general terms of reference I envisage the following subjects as coming within the scope of the Board,   This is notnecessarily a firm list.   The choice of subject will depend on developments and on the Board itself:i the choice cf reactor systems to be developed in the UK, takidomestic, international and overseas trade considerationsinto account; .ii specific programmes of development work which are believed to have commercial potential (including prototypeand design studies) and the allocation of this work, e.g, betweenthe new company and the ASA;iii the allocation of Government funds for R and D;iv the ordering of nuclear power stations; &quot;v possible ways- of developing international collaboration;vi the position of specialist component manufacturers;vii the underlying nuclear research programme;viii major system developments of longer term applicatione.g. fusion.
6      The KPAB ;;.lll also &quot;be able to initiate it a own studies and makevac ommend at i o ns.7      I will appoint its Chairman and members, and its Secretariatv/ill be provided by my Department.Chairman8      The choice is between a DTI Minister or senior official and anindependent Chairman,   On balance I regard an independent Chairmanwith relevant industrial experience as preferable.   The industryseems to expect it and his position would not be complicated, as would a DTI Chairman&apos;s, by the individual statutory relationships between the Department and sere of the proposed members.    He would bein a   better position to get the members to give clear and committedviews and to produce concerted and firrr. (if not always unanimous)advice even though the members&apos; individual interests could diverge.Membership9      The membership should be representative of all the main interestsin the nuclear field.    At the same time the KFA3 will perform betterif its formal membership is small.   The following outside membership is proposed: the new d/c company - (one member)The Electricity Supply industry - (one member eachfrom the Electricity Council, the CEG3 and the SS3B).The sea - (one member)BIIPL, the fuel company - (one member)The nuclear power component industry - (one member)I am looking further to see if the representation of the &quot;electricity industry can be reduced to two.
10    t.a r.;g:::-dr; Ccvcr^nt Bopartriftts, il in prcpoocd that there shouldbe a member from my Dopai-imeni who would consult the oth-:-r. Departcentoinvolved and represent the Government interest or. the Board.    Clearmachinery would be established for ouch consultation,    I do not considerwe can have r.ore than one voice of -Government cn the Board,11    Kombcrs would be expected, so far as is possible, to participatewith full commitment on behalf of the bodies they rcpro^i:!.Confidentiality of reports12     Since the KP/JVs role will be a continuing one, unlike many externalCommittees, it will need to have a clc^e and regular relationship withthe DTI.   The intention is not normally to publish its advice.    It may be difficult to persuade the Select Committee or; Science and Technologyto accept this but we do not believe it would be suitable to make anygeneral premise to make public any advice, reccmrer.dations or reportsof a body whose members will be representative of the industrial interests -and whose advice is to be given on a continuing basis and is bound to be based on commercially confidential information.    It would,prejudice the KPA3&apos;s work if its members did not feel protected in thisrespect,   The Select Committee, of course, would bo at liberty to examinemembers if they wished.8 February 1973
