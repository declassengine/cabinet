THis DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S government cp(73) 35 COPY NO     0 020 March 1973CABINETCOMPANY PROFITS, INVESTMENT AND GROWTHMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry10 I wish to draw the attention of the Cabinet, in the light of ourforthcoming consideration of the Price and Pay Code, to the decliningtrend in company profits and the return on capital employed because ofthe possible adverse implications for new investment and the prospect of achieving a higher rate of growth.2. The attached note by Department of Trade and industry officialsshows that profits as a proportion of national income have declinedsharply over the past decade and more, whilst the shares of employmentincomes and of rent have both risen,,    Even more significant, in view ofthe implications for new productive investment, is the sharp decline in thereturn on capital employed in manufacturing industry after allowing for capital consumption and stock appreciation.3. There are various factors which can help to explain the declineover the past decade and more, including increased international competition, more vigorous domestic competition policies, the increasedbargaining power of labour, the possibility that in the past price restraintmay have been more effective than pay restraint, and the fact that manymanagements have not allowed for the higher cost of replacing capitalassets in times of inflation.    Whilst the operation of some of these factors has benefitted the economy, I am concerned lest the recent low rate of return on productive investment in real terms adversely affect our future prospects of achieving faster growth.4. The available data do not enable us to make satisfactoryinternational comparisons so we cannot say how United Kingdomexperience compares with that of our main industrial competitors.    but with an increasingly open international trading and investment systemwe must expect resources to flow to those countries which offer theprospect of the highest returns, particularly within the european economic Community.1
50 Although the underlying trend in real profitability has clearlybeen downwards, we would normally expect a significant upturn at thecurrent stage of the economic cycle.    If we are too rigorous in theapplication of price and profit controls we are likely not only to damp down the current cyclical upturn in profitability but also to prevent the longhoped for upturn in investment.    The last intentions survey suggested thatthe fall of 10 per cent in manufacturing investment in 1972 would befollowed by a moderate rise in 1973 and a strong rise in 1974,    Theresults of this inquiry do not reflect changes in manufacturers1expectations foUowing publication of the detailed rules for price and profitcontrol in the Green Paper on the Price and Pay Code.    But we have since received very strong representations from industry that theapplication of the code in its original form would remove much of the incentive to invest and to improve efficiency generallyc6o The company sector is now unusually liquid, so that availability offinance is not at present a constraint on investment,.    Although there hasbeen a sharp rise in interest rates, these are probably not too high in real terms after allowing for corporation tax and the effects of inflation.Expectations of profitability and thus the rate of return on capital aretherefore likely to determine the willingness of manufacturers to invest.7. Our strategy for faster growth and for regional development make sit essential to maintain willingness to invest and to improve industrial efficiency.    Fiscal incentives and selective financial assistance will notbe sufficient if the expected return on productive investment is inadequate compared with alternative uses of funds,,    The final version of the Price and Pay Code and longer-term decisions must recognise theneed to achieve our objectives for investment and growth.P w department of Trade and Industry19 March 19732
COMPANY   PROFITSNote by DTI officials       There has been little real growth in gross trading profits of companies at constant prices since the mid 1950rs, and their share of  total domestic income at current prices has fallen by-one quarter over this period.   Net trading profits^^ at constant prices have actually declined and their share of total net domesticincome has been halved.   Table 1 compares the share of grosscompany profits over this period with the other categories of domestic income, namely income from employment and self-employment,public sector trading surpluses and rent.   Table 2 gives a similarcomparison in net terms.    It shows that the decline in the shareof profits after allowing for capital consumption and stockappreciation is largely offset by an increase in the share of income from employment and self-employment although there hasalso been a significant increase in the share of rent (includingbusiness rents).2      More important than the share of profits in national income is the rate of return on capital employed since it is this whichis likely to influence new investment by companies.   Tables 3 and h show the rate of return on capital employed by quoted(2)manufacturing companies on a historic costv &apos; and replacement cost^^ basis respectively.    In manufacturing industry as a whole,(l)   Net profits after allowing for capital consumption (theestimated amount of capital resources at current replacement cost used up in the process of production) and stockappreciation (that part of the change in the value of stocks and work in progress during the year which arises from increases in prices).(2)   Trading profits less depreciation calculated on historiccosts, expressed as a percentage of net assets, includingfixed assets at historic costs.(3)   Trading profit less depreciation at current prices and lessstock appreciation, expressed as a percentage of netassets, including fixed assets at current prices.
the rate of return on a historic cost basis has fallen by a third over the past decade, but has been halved after allowing for capital consumption and stock appreciation.   All the industrygroups distinguished show falls, the smallest being in food,drink and   tobacco, and the greatest in chemicals, engineering and metal manufacture.3      Thus a substantial part of the decline in profitabilitybecomes apparent only after deducting the sums needed to maintainexisting business capital.   Since these allowances are not fullymade in conventional accounts, it is likely that companies oftenfind themselves with less funds available for expansion than theywould expect from their experience of making a comparable rateof return in the past, even though post-tax rates of return havefallen rather less steeply than the pre-tax rates shown.The Immediate Outlookk      Even after deducting the sums needed to maintain existingbusiness capital, there was probably a moderate rise in the moneyvalue of company profits   in 1972.   There was also a substantial increase in company liquidity in 1971 and 1972 after the squeezein the previous two years.   At the current stage of the economiccycle a sharp increase in company profits would normally be expected.The extent to which this will be realised will however depend on the severity of price and profit controls.Profits, Investment and Growth5      Although profits are particularly subject to fluctuation inthe economic cycle, the underlying trend has clearly been down-wards.   This decline could have an adverse effect on new invest-ment both by depressing expectations of profitability and by reducing the finance available for investment.   There is no firm-2-
evidence that the decline in profits has had a depressing effect on investment in the past; the effect of the declinemay to some extent have been mitigated by improved investment incentives.    Indeed, table 5 shows that investment as a proportion of national product has risen over the past 20 years,although only slowly in the past decade.6      Company liquidity is at present adequate to finance thehoped for upturn in investment and the anticipated increase in stocks.   But there must be concern about the possible futureimplications for growth of a continuing low rate of return in real terms, particularly on manufacturers&apos; willingness to invest.Ik March 1973
