CHAPTER 1:    INTRODUCTION1.1.   This YJhite Paper sets out the Government&apos;s proposals for thefuture constitution, structure and organisation of broadcasting.These proposals are the result of the Government&apos;s considerationof the Report of the Committee on the Future of Broadcasting(Cmnd 6753) under the chairmanship of Lord Annan, and of the manycomments received on the Committee1s recommendations.   TheGovernment wishes to pay tribute here to the work of the AnnanCommittee.   Not all of the specific recommendations made by theCommittee have been accepted, but their approach to the issues,and the range and quality of thinking in their Report haveilluminated all subsequent consideration of this important subject.The YJhite Paper is in two parts:   the first explains theGovernment&apos;s main proposals for the future structure andorganisation of broadcasting;   the second sets out the Government&apos;sconclusions on the detailed constitutional arrangements forbroadcasting and on the other issues raised in the Annan Reportwhich call for a response from the Government.1.2.   The main features of the Government&apos;s proposals are:- The British Broadcasting Corporation (BEG) and theIndependent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) will continue to beresponsible for the broadcasting services which they nowprovide.   There will be some changes in the internal structureof the BBC to enable the Board of Governors to concentrateon their role as trustees of the public interest.- The IBA&apos;s supervisory responsibilities will be extended toembrace cable services, including pilot schemes of pay-television and other forms of local broadcasting.- An Open Broadcasting Authority (OBA) will be established tosupervise a new service on the fourth television channel;   anda Welsh language service will have priority on the fourthchannel in Wales.
- Both BBC and independent local radio services will bepermitted to expand.- A single independent Broadcasting Complaints Commission willbe established.- The BBC, the IBA and the OBA will be required to conductpublic hearings from time to time in different parts of thecountry to ascertain the views of members of the public aboutthe services they provide.- The obligations which will be common to all three broadcastingauthorities will be incorporated in legislation, though thiswill not affect the BBC&apos;s status as a Royal Charter body.1.3*   The Government intends to bring forward at the earliestopportunity legislation to give effect to those of the proposalsin the White Paper which are appropriate to legislation and toapply for a new Royal Charter for the BBC.    In framing the legisla**.tion and the Charter the Government will wish to have discussionswith the broadcasting organisations about the implementation of theproposals, and also to take account of their comments and those ofother individuals and organisations who may wish to express viewson them.
PART I:    THE STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATION OP BROADCASTINGCHAPTER 2:   TEE GOVERNMENTS APPROACH2.1.    In formulating the proposals in this White Paper theGovernment is fully aware of its primary responsibility forensuring that our broadcasting system will enable the quality andrange of the broadcasting services of the United Kingdom to bemaintained and, wherever possible, improved.   The system shouldencourage the best possible use of all the talents, creativetechnical and managerial, upon which good broadcasting depends;and it should build on the wealth of experience and expertise thatalready exists in broadcasting in this country.   The constituentparts of the system should each have a sound organisational andfinancial base and, so far as possible, they should each have adifferent mix of sources of finance.2.2.   The Government1s principal conclusion is that our broadcastingservices should continue to be provided as public services andshould continue to be the responsibility of public authorities.The concepts of the broadcasting authority and of public servicebroadcasting have stood the test of time.   They should form thefoundation for the future.2.3.   The Government also accepts the four requisites for goodbroadcasting identified by the Annan Committee - flexibility,diversity, editorial independence and public accountability.Flexibility is essential if broadcasting is to be able to respondto the changes which will occur over the next decade or so.Technological developments - for example, satellite broadcasting,the evolution of cable, electronic news gathering and the wideruse of teletext and video recording equipment - will have aprofound impact on broadcasting.   With the expansion of localradio and the development of a new service on the fourth televdchannel, there will be an increase in the number of broadcastoutlets.   Moreover, as more households acquire a second tele\set and a second or third radio, viewing and listening are likelyto become increasingly      individual rather than     familyoccupations, and there will in consequence be a demand for more,and more varied, programmes.
SECRET r2.4*   Our broadcasting system must also encourage diversity.   Thetalents upon which good broadcasting depends must be able not onlyto flourish and blend but to do so in different ways so as to enrichthe range and variety of programmes and programme services.   Thesingle most important opportunity for increasing this diversity -for exploring new dimensions in broadcasting - lies in thedevelopment of the fourth television channel and the Government hasformulated its proposals for the use of the channel accordingly.2-5*   As the Annan Committee observed, diversity in broadcastingwould be of small value if the broadcasters were not editoriallyindependent.    It is a major objective of policy to secure thisindependence.   Editorial freedom carries with it, however, certainobligations, in particular that it should be exercised responsibly.2.6.    It is not easy to strike the right balance consistentlybetween editorial independence and responsible broadcasting and itis particularly difficult for the BBC whose Board of Governors(unlike the Independent Broadcasting Authority) have a dualfunction:   the Governors are responsible for supervising andregulating the services provided by the BBC in the public interestas well as for the management of the Corporation.   The AnnanCommittee observed that over recent years the dual responsibilitiesof the Board of Governors have been a source of some confusion.The Government shares this view and certain changes in the internalstructure of the BBC are proposed in Chapter 5 in order tore-emphasise the regulatory and supervisory role of the Governorsand to enable them to be more accountable for their trusteeshipof the public interest.2.7*    It is integral to the role of the broadcasting authoritiesthat they should be publicly accountable for their trusteeship ofthe public interest.   For this reason members of the authorities areappointed by, or on the advice of, the Government of the day, whichis answerable in turn to Parliament, and the annual reports of theauthorities are presented to Parliament.   However, the AnnanCommittee observed that the greatest volume of criticism about thepresent structure had come to them from those who believed that thebroadcasters had been insensitive in the past ten years to the viewsexpressed by large sections of the public and were insufficientlyaccountable to them.   This YJhite Paper includes proposals designedto improve the arrangements by which the broadcasting authoritiesaccount to the public for their trusteeship of the public interest.SECRET
CHAPTER 3:    THB FOURTH CHAinfEL3*1*   The most important development in &quot;broadcasting in thiscountry in the next few years will be the introduction of a serviceon the fourth television channel.   Most television sets aredesigned to receive four channels and frequencies are available forbroadcasting on the fourth.    In engineering terms all that isneeded is to instal at the transmitting stations additionalequipment (which nearly all the stations have been designed toaccommodate), and in some cases to make arrangements for theprogrammes to be fed to the stations.   But the programmes will haveto be planned and produced and put together to form a service, andthe first question which needs to be considered is v/hat kind ofservice should be provided on the fourth channel.What kind of service should be provided?3.2.   A unique opportunity will be missed if the fourth channelis not used to explore the possibilities of programmes which saysomething new in new ways.   The aim will be to widen the choiceavailable to viewers by providing programmes which are interestingand worthwhile in their own right but are not intended to competewith programmes on the existing channels for mass audiences.   Thetalent exists in this country to respond to the challenge whichthis opportunity offers.   The Government shares the Annan Committee1view that the service should include educational programmes,including some additional programmes for the Open University, andalso programmes which cater for minority tastes and interests,particularly those which are not adequately catered for on theexisting three television services.   Programmes of this kind must,however, continue to have a place on the other three channels.   Asregards minority interest programmes it would be a mistake tosuppose that the minorities in question are invariably small:   manyof them will comprise millions of people, for example, those whofollow or play particular sports or are interested in particularkinds of music or drama.   The fourth channel will also provide asignificant new outlet for programmes which reflect the diversityof cultures in this country, including the cultures of the ethnicminorities and of newcomers to this country.   It will be importantto ensure that some of the educational and minority interest.t&apos;* i p n im p**)p
3*5*   The Government agrees with the Annan Committee that adifferent kind of service requires a new authority.   Itsforthcoming broadcasting legislation will therefore containproposals for the establishment of an Open Broadcasting Authority(OBA).   It will be the new Authority&apos;s function to provide andsupervise a television service of high quality which informs,educates and entertains and also fulfils the objectives outlinedin the preceding paragraphs, that is a service in which priorityis given to:-(a) educational programmes;(b) programmes catering particularly for tastes and interestswhich are&apos; not adequately catered for on the existing threeservices;    and(c) programmes produced outside the existing broadcastingorganisations.programmes on &quot;the fourth channel are broadcast at peak viewingtimes.3.3.   The use of the fourth channel for programmes of minority-interest will also be reflected in the arrangements (described inmore detail in Chapter 7) for a VIelsh language service to havepriority on the fourth channel in V/ales.   At the outset, however,except in Wales, the fourth channel service will be a single servicethroughout the United Kingdom, though in the longer term regionalvariations in the service will be encouraged.3.4.   The character of the fourth channel service will bedetermined not only by the kinds of programmes it contains butalso by the sources from which its programmes will be obtained.The Government agrees with the Annan Committee that the fourthchannel should include programmes from a wide variety of sources,in particular producers from outside the existing broadcastingorganisations.    It is also desirable that the fourth channel shoulddevelop a distinctive news service, although news gathering is anexpensive operation and the Government recognises that at any rate inthe shorter term the channel will need to look to existing sourcesfor its nev/s service.A new Authority
It will &quot;be the Authority&apos;s duty to commission, purchase orotherwise acquire programmes for the fourth channel service and toexercise overall supervision of the service as a public serviceconducted in the public interest.   It will not itself makeprogrammes;   nor will it engineer the channel or transmit theservice (see paragraph 3*15)*   This means that the OBA will need onla relatively small organisation.3.6.   The function of acquiring programmes for broadcasting on thefourth channel will mean that the OBA will operate in some sense asa publisher.   The Annan Committee recommended that, as a publisher,the Authority should not be responsible (in the way in which theIBA is responsible in relation to independent television and localradio) for the programmes broadcast on the fourth channel.   TheGovernment does not accept this recommendation.   The concept of abroadcasting authority requires that the authority should beresponsible for the service it provides, and that the service shouldconform with certain basic requirements, for example that due -impartiality is preserved in the treatment of controversial matters,and that nothing should be broadcast which incites to crime or isoffensive to public feeling.    (These requirements are discussedfurther in relation to all broadcasting authorities in Chapter 10).As respects programme standards, therefore, the OBA will, with oneexception, described in the following paragraph, be bound by theobligations which are common to the BBC and the IBA.3.7*   The 0E\ will have a special obligation to seek programmesfrom a wide variety of sources and to provide programmes which caterfor minority tastes and interests.    It would be inconsistent,therefore, to require the Authority (as the BBC and the IBA arerequired - see paragraph 10.2) to secure a &quot;proper balance&quot; in termsof the range and variety of the subject matter of its broadcastprogrammes.   This requirement of &quot;proper balance&quot; will not thereforebe imposed on the new Authority.3*8.   The proposals outlined above are ambitious.   They willconstitute a challenge not only to programme makers but also tothe new Authority.   The fourth channel service will have to competeon its merits for the attention of viewers who are used to a widerange of interesting and well made programmes, many of them havinga wide popular appeal, on the existing channels.    It will be
essential, therefore, to appoint as members of the new Authorityand to its staff people with original ideas and the ability to putthem into practice - people who will be able to explore to the fullthe possibilities which the channel will open up.   The Authority willalso, however, need to include and be served by people withexperience and expertise in broadcasting and business, and bypeople who are familiar v/ith some of the kinds of broadcasting(for example educational broadcasting)which will have a significantplace on the fourth channel service.   The Government&apos;s forthcomingbroadcasting legislation will provide for the appointment of themembers of the OBA by the Home Secretary, and for the establishmentof advisory committees to advise the Authority on various aspectsof the fourth channel service (including regional aspects as andwhen regional variations become feasible).How should the fourth channel be organised and financed?3.9*   As regards organisation, programmes, and particularly programmeseries, need to be planned years ahead and a year is often neededfor the planning of programme schedules.   The making of programmesentails the commitment of often substantial resources- human,physical and financial:   unless the programme maker can count on areasonable return for his effort, he will not be prepared to commithis resources.   A professional broadcaster with one of the existingbroadcasting organisations will also want some assurance about thecircumstances in which the programme will be put on the air - inparticular, whether it is likely to compete with other programmesmade by his organisation.   Moreover, the programme maker will notbe able to provide regular employment for those who work for himunless he can actually sell programmes on a regular basis.Similarly, the OBA will need to make long term plans involving theprogramme makers for the development of the fourth channel serviceand will itself need some assurance about the kind and sources ofprogrammes which it will be possible to put on the air in themonths and years ahead.   All this points to the need for the OBAto establish continuing relationships with some programme makers,so as to be able to provide a foundation of regular programmes onwhich the fourth channel service can be built.   It will be importantto ensure, however, that the existence of relationships of this kinddo not adversely affect the character and quality of the fourthchannel service.
**M mm      gps gMBU3.10,   As regards finance, the OBA will need funds to purchase orcommission programmes, to reimburse the IBA for engineering andtransmitting the fourth channel service and for its own administra-tive purposes.    (For comparison it might be noted that the cost ofBBC2 in 1977-78 was some  45 million.)   The Government believes that,in order to have an assured financial base, a minority channel ofthe kind envisaged is bound to need a measure of financialassistance from the Government, at any rate in the early years whenthe fourth channel service is being launched.   The OBA willnecessarily incur expenditure (eg on commissioning programmes)before the service comes on the air and before receipts (eg fromsales of advertising time) come in.   Provision for generalfinancial assistance to the OBA will therefore be included in theGovernment&apos;s forthcoming legislation.   For some special programmes(eg some educational, including Open University, programmes )therequirement for Government assistance will continue.   However, asthe fourth channel service becomes an established part of broadcast-ing in this country and gains a regular following among viewers,the Government will expect the OBA to look to advertising revenuesof various kinds to provide, directly and indirectly, an importantand increasing source of finance for its other operations.   Thefinancial position of the OBA will therefore be kept under review asthe service develops.3.11.  -Sponsorship might produce, either directly or indirectly, asource of finance for the channel:   commercial and industrialconcerns may be prepared, in return for having their namesassociated with particular productions, to pay some share of thecost of those productions.   Block advertising (ie advertisements inbreaks of perhaps 10 or 15 minutes) may also generate some revenue.It seems unlikely, however, that sponsorship and block advertisingby themselves could provide a substantial part of the finance whichwill have to be found from advertising, and the legislation willtherefore enable not only these forms of advertising but also spotadvertising (ie advertisements in breaks of only a couple of minutes)to be sold on the fourth channel.   Similar rules on the lines ofthose now in the Independent Broadcasting Authority Act 1973 will beapplied to spot advertising both on ITV and on the fourth channel,and, v/ith appropriate modifications to block advertisingon the fourth channel.   There will need to be safeguards to ensurethat there is no conflict of interest between the 03A&apos;sresponsibilities for the control ofadvertising on the fourth channeland the arrangements it makes for the sale of advertising and  also
that the editorial independence of the fourth channel is in no waycompromised by the admission of sponsored programmes.3*12.    It will be for the OBA, taking account of the financialresources available to it, to make its own arrangements for thesupply of programmes and for the sale of advertising time, and theGovernment proposes that the legislation should give it considerableflexibility in these matters.   Thus the legislation will enable theOBA to make contracts for the supply of programmes suitable for thefourth channel services and for the right to sell advertisementsof particular kinds or at particular times on the channel.   The OBAwill also be empowered to negotiate contracts under which, inreturn for the payment of a rental, its regular programme makerswould have the right to sell advertising time during the programmesthey supply and an understanding about how their programmes wouldbe scheduled.3*13*   The OBA will be free to commission programmes from any source- ITV, the BBC or freelance.    Its regular programme sources will,of course, include the existing independent television system.   TheITV companies have the capacity to expand their production ofprogrammes and the organisational arrangements for sellingadvertising time, and it is to be expected that the fourth channelservice will have to rely on the companies, particularly in theearly years, for a significant part of its output and for a regularsupply of programmes.3.14*    l&quot;t will be essential, however, to ensure both that theprogrammes which the ITV companies provide for the fourth channelare of the kind and quality required and that their involvementwith the fourth channel does not adversely affect the service on theexisting ITV channel.   It will also be necessary to consider howany revenues which the companies might derive from, and anyexpenditure which they might incur as a result of, any involvementwith the fourth channel should be treated for levy purposes.   TheOBA will be responsible for deciding the arrangements for theallocation of time to, and the provision of programmes by, theindependent television system. Decisions will have financialconsequences:    so long, therefore, as the OBA is receiving or isliable to need a Government grant, the Government will need to beconsulted about them.   Because the decisions could also affect thequality ancbalance-C^^maigrammes provided by the independent
television companies for the existing ITV channel, for which theIBA is responsible, the OBA will need to consult the IBA about theneed for and extent of IBA involvement in the arrangements betweenthe OBA and the independent television system.   There will in anycase need to be discussions about the question of scheduling andthe OBA may wish to consider with the IBA the possibility of somecomplementary scheduling between the ITV channel and the fourthchannel.   These organisational and operational matters will needto be considered further, taking account of comments received onthis YJhite Paper.Engineering3.15*   The IBA has already spent some  5 million on the engineeringwork needed to put the fourth channel on the air and the Governmentagrees with the Annan Committee that, in order to keep the costto a minimum, to avoid unnecessary delay and to maintain goodrelations at the transmitting stations, the IBA should beresponsible for engineering the fourth channel and for transmittingthe fourth channel service.   The development of the fourth channelmust not be at the expense of the programme to extend UHP televisionservices to communities of more than $00 people, but the Governmentintends to begin immediate discussions with the IBA about theengineering work for the fourth channel, so that this work cancommence as soon as possible.3.16.   The IBA estimates that to provide a network of transmittersfor the fourth channel with a population coverage of 80 per centof the population in each of the existing ITV franchise areas wouldcost some  14*5 million (at current prices) over four and a halfyears.   The aim will be, however, (as for the existing UHPtelevision services) to extend the coverage to just over 99 per centof the population of the United Kingdom.   This would cost anadditional  13*5 million and take a further four and a half years.The OEA will reimburse the IEA for the cost of engineering andtransmitting the fourth channel service, but the Government will beprepared, if necessary, to make loans to the IBA for the engineeringwork.
CHAPTER k.LOCAL RADIOThe advent - and the success - of local radio has been animportant feature of the development of broadcasting in recent years.There are at present 20 BBC and 19 independent local radio stationswith a coverage of some 70 per cent of the population of the UK.These stations were established between 1968 and 1976 after which themoratorium called on the expansion of local radio pending the AnnanCommittee&apos;s deliberations on the future of broadcasting took effect.There is an evident demand for local radio.       It is the Government&apos;sintention, therefore, that local radio should   be brought to as muchof the population of the United Kingdom as possible as soon aspossible.What kind of service should be provided?k.2      Local radio must meet the needs which the BBC&apos;s nationalradio services cannot serve because they are not locally orientated.There is a close analogy here with local and national newspapers.The Government agrees with the Annan Committoe&apos;8 concept of localradio - that each station should have a general duty to inform,entertain and educate, but that each should have a special obligationto celebrate the particular quality of life in its locality.   Localradio can provide people with information and news about what ishappening in their community and it can afford individuals andgroups an opportunity to communicate with the communities to whichthey belong.       In these ways local radio can bind a communitytogether, nourish that which is distinctive about a community, andrespond, in ways not open to the national networks, to the needsand wishes of the community, and of individuals and groups withinthe community   it serves.     For example, a local radio stationcan reflect the differing cultures of the ethnic minority   groupsin its area and respond to their special needs.     It can alsocontribute towards bringing together the new communities which havebeen formed as a result of local government reorganisation.^.3      The question arises, however, as to the moaning of &quot;community&quot;and &quot;local&quot;.     It would not be sensible, or indeed feasible, eitherin terms of frequency usage or in financial terms, for every townand village in the country to have its own local radio station.(In this connection the Government has taken note, however, of thetwo experiments which the BBC has conducted with mobile neighbourhood
stations.    It also notes that both the BBC and the IBA wish to conductmore experiments of this kind.     The Government accepts that this formof broadcasting may have a part to play in the context of local radio,though it cannot be a substitute for local radio.)     At the otherextreme there comes a point at which the area and populationcovered by a local radio station becomes too large to justify thedescription &quot;local&quot;.     It would be impossible to say what sort ofcoverage is ideal for a local radio station;    this will vary, insome cases considerably, from area to area.   There must be doubt,however, whether the present coverage of some BBC and independentlocal radio stations produces local radio services which can becalled genuinely local in all the areas in which they can bereceived.How should local radio be organised and financed?The Annan Committee recommended that a new Local BroadcastingAuthority should be established to supervise a predominantlycommercial local radio system.     They regarded local radio as a&quot;different animal from network broadcasting&quot; which required a&quot;different keeper&quot;.     In particular they believed that as long aslocal radio was an appendage of the BEG and the IBA it could nothope to command first priority in their thinking and that it hadinherited a variety of policies in relation to the handling of newsand current affairs and as regards technical matters v/hich had beenformulated in the context of the national networks.     The Governmentis not persuaded that this constitutes a case for the creation ofa new authority to supervise local radio.     The success v/hich localradio has had has been considerable, and there must be a presumptionagainst creating a new organisation, with additional expense andbureaucracy, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that theexisting organisations are unsuitable for the purpose.^.5      By far the greatest volume of replies to the Home Secretary1sinvitation to comment on the Annan Report concerned the future oflocal radio.     Most of those commenting were in favour of theretention of BBC local radio, though some seemed simply to be infavour of local radio of some sort in their area, while othersseemed to believe that the options available were either   B3G localradio or no local radio at all.   Notwithstanding this, there isclearly a substantial measure of support for B3C local radio.
It is also clear from the research undertaken by the Joint IndustryCommittee for Radio Audience Research   that independent local radiohas a very considerable following, substantially greater than thatof BBC local radio, and in some cases comparable with that of themost popular of the BBC&apos;s national radio services, BBC Radio 1.h.6      The Government considers that there are sufficient frequenciesfor two local radio services for much of the country, provided thatthe coverage of each station, including some of the existing stations,is limited.     It has therefore concluded that both the BBC and theIBA should be permitted to expand their local radio services.     Theintention will be that as many areas of the country as possible willeventually have two local radio services, though in some parts ofthe country it will be neither practicable nor sensible to providemore than one service,b.7      As a basis for planning future expansion the Governmentproposes to have regard to the following criteria :-(a) The most efficient use possible should be made of theavailable frequencies 60 as to enable local radio servicesto be brought to as much of the population of the OK as ispracticable.   It may be that in future some local radiostations should broadcast only on MF or on VHF.(b) Account should be taken of links of community interest inplanning the coverage areas of local radio stations.(c) Account should be taken of the need to ensure that independentlocal radio stations have a sound financial basis.(d) Areas which are not at present served by any local radiostation should be given priority over those which are.(e) High priority should be given to areas which arerelatively deprived in terms of social amenities.(f) The initial phase of expansion should include experimentalassociate or twinned stations and, if practicable, astation run by a non-profit-making trust (see paragraphsk22 and kg).* [To follow],
*t.8      As an immediate start, the Government proposes to authorisethe IBA and the BBC each to establish a number of additional localradio stations, taking account of the factors listed in the precedingparagraph.     The locations of these stations will be discussedurgently in a working party under Home Office chairmanship, on whichthe BBC and the IBA will be represented.In the slightly longer term the working party will alsohave the task of preparing proposals for the further development oflocal radio, by stages, over the United Kingdom as a whole.   Theworking party   will publish reports on   the possibilities from timeto time.     It is right that the public should be given an opportunityto comment on the longer term possibilities as respects the totalcoverage;     the proposals for particular local   radio areas and forthe allocation to the BBC or to the IBA of those areas in which onlyone service can be provided;   and the order in which new local radiostations might be established.     The Government will reach decisionson the working party&apos;s proposals in the light of those comments andafter such further consultation with the BBC and the IBA as may benecessary.h.10    Once these decisions about the location of BBC and independentlocal radio stations have been reached, it v/ill be for the BBC andthe IBA to expand their services in accordance with them.   For theIBA, this will mean inviting applications for franchises.   In linewith the proposals in paragraph 8.3* the procedure for awarding anew local radio franchise will include a public hearing.     The rateat which BEC and independent local radio will be able to expand willdepend largely on the availability of finance.     It will be for theBBC to decide for itself, having regard to the money available to itfrom time to time out of the licence fee revenue, what priority toaccord to the expansion of its local radio services.J+.11     Independent local radio stations will continue to be financedprincipally by spot advertising.   However, this method, which hasdemonstrated its viability in the larger urban areas, is unlikelyto be adequate for stations in the more remote, rural areas, partlybecause transmission costs are likely to be relatively high in theseareas and partly because advertising revenue is likely to berelatively low, corresponding    with the relatively small populationsgtmt mm ^m% mm mmmmm
which such stations would serve.     This raises the question howindependent local radio can (as it is desirable it should) be broughtto these areas.     Among the Annan Committee1s ideas were that aprofitable station might be required to provide an affiliate servicein a contiguous area;   and that there might be some cross-subsidisatiorthrough the rentals system.h.12    Some element of cross-subsidisation through the IBA18 systemof primary and secondary rentals will play an important part in theexpansion of independent local radio.     The Government will considerin consultation with the IBA whether the Authority should have anyadditional powers for this purpose.     The Annan Committee&apos;s proposalfor affiliate stations may also help to finance local radio in theremoter areas.     Both the IBA and the Association of IndependentRadio Contractors have indicated ways in which this idea might bedeveloped.   An affiliate station could be set up in an area next tothe area of a profitable local radio station.     The two could belinked so that some of the output of the affiliate station - asmuch as it could afford - would be its own programmes, while otherprogrammes could be provided by the principal station.     A furtherdevelopment of the concept of cost-sharing local radio stationshas been put forward by the IBA.   The Authority has suggested thatin some cases it might be possible to establish two small localradio stations which were &quot;twinned&quot;, thus suiting the social needsand the&quot;economic resources of some smaller localities.   TheGovernment welcomes these ideas for bringing independent localradio to the less populous areas of the country and, as indicatedin paragraph *f.7i priority will be given to experiments with theseideas.*t.l3    The Government intends to allow the IBA flexibility todevelop independent local radio and to establish local radiostations which are diverse in character.     The Authority will beable to experiment with the Annan Committee&apos;s ideas that non-profit-making trusts should be awarded franchises and that localauthorities might be given some role in local radio stations.
Constitutional arrangements for local radioh.lk    As indicated in paragraphs 8.2 and 8.3i the Governmentproposes that the BBC and the IBA should be required to conductpublic hearings in relation to the services for which they areresponsible.     These obligations will also apply in relation totheir respective local radio services.     The powers and duties ofthe IBA in relation to its independent local radio service will beretained substantially as set out in the Independent BroadcastingAuthority Act 1973* though with modifications described inChapter 12 of this White Paper.J+.15     If* as the Government expects, an expanded system ofindependent local radio is successful, it is also likely to be&apos;;profitable.   Since such profits will be derived from theexploitation of a public asset, the radio frequency spectrum,it is right that the public should have some share in them.In early years, this share will take the form of finance for theexpansion of independent local radio by means of cross-subsidisationthrough the rental system.     Thereafter, however, this share of theprofitability of local radio could be of a more direct nature, inthe form of a levy similar to that which applies to the profitsof the independent   television companies.   Proposals for theeventual introduction of such a levy will therefore be included inthe Government&apos;s forthcoming broadcasting legislation.
CHAPTER $: THE BBC5-1     The Government agrees with the Annan Committee that theBBC is arguably the single most important cultural organisationin the nation, and that it should continue to be the main nationalinstrument of broadcasting in the United Kingdom.&apos;   This is not,of course, inconsistent with the provision of special programmesof interest to particular parts of the United Kingdom.    Theestablishment of the EBCs regional production network hasenabled it to provide regional programmes, some intended forthe region in v/hich they are made, and some for a wider audience.The Government has taken note of the recent reorganisation of theBBCs regional structure.5.2    The Government welcomes the opportunity to endorse theAnnan Committee1s overall assessment of the performance of theBBC: that many BBC programmes are good, and that some areexcellent;  that the BBC has earned an impressive reputationabroad; and that the public is getting good value for its licencefee.   But there have also been criticisms of the BBC - that itis too monolithic, too impervious to criticism and too bureacratic,and that the old loyalty to the concept of public servicebroadcasting has been overlaid by loyalty to the concept ofprofessionalism.   A minority of six members of the Committeeconsidered that the solution to these problems, and the pursuitof diversity in broadcasting required that the Corporation shouldbe divided into two organisations   each with its own Board ofGovernors, one providing two national television services andthe other the national radio services and the external services.5*3     The Government considers that the BBC should continue to bererponsible for all the broadcasting services which it presentlyprovides   including local radio services.   It notes v/ith approvalthat the Corporation is examining the criticisms contained in theAnnan Report.    It considers, however, that some of the criticismsmade in the Report show a need for changes in the internalThe Annan Committee&apos;s terms of reference extended only to thefuture of broadcasting services in the United Kingdom.   Theexternal services of the BBC have recently been considered aspart of the review of overseas representation conducted by theCentral Policy Review Staff and the Expenditure Committee ofthe House.of Commons. [The Government1s main comments on theirrecommendations are set out in t-he White Paper on OverseasRepresentati^jg^jjg-j&quot;    (Cmnd    )J
structure of the BBC to separate more clearly the guardianshipof the public interest from the managerial responsibilityfor broadcasting services.5-^     As noted in paragraph 2.6 the role of the Governors isan especially difficult one; they are responsible (as is theIBA in relation to independent television and local radio) forsupervising and regulating the BBCs services in the publicinterest; they are also responsible, however, for the whole ofthe management of the BBCs various under takings (in a way inwhich the IBA is not responsible for the programme companies).This dual role has over the recent years become a source ofsome confusion.    In particular, it has appeared that the functionsof supervising and regulating in the public interest theCorporation*s activities on the domestic services have sometimesbeen subordinated to the Governors&apos; managerial role. As theAnnan Committee observed the Governors are the trustees of thepublic interest and they should not identify themselves tooclosely with the day to day decision-taking in the Corporationor they will never be able to call for a change of policy inthe public interest.5-5     The Government considers that changes in the internalstructure of the BBC are required to distance the Governorsfrom detailed involvement in management so as to enable themto concentrate more on their supervisory and regulatory functions.At the same time, while the essential unity of the BBC shouldbe preserved   there would be advantage in a measure ofdecentralisation for each of the BBCs three services (televisionradio and the external services).   This would encourage greatercreativity and diversity of approach in programme making, includingthe presentation of news and current affairs on the domesticservices   subject of course to the fulfilment of the generalobligations laid on broadcasting authorities which are discussedin Chapter 10.    [As stated in the White Paper on OverseasRepresentation] the BBC External Services are a proven successand represent a national asset which we should be careful topreserve.
SECRET 215.6     The Governors will continue therefore to be thegoverning body of the BBC.   They will have overall responsibilityfor securing compliance with the requirements constitutionallylaid upon the BBC; they will be the guardians of the publicinterest in relation to programmes and management; they willcontinue to decide priorities - eg capital expenditure and useof frequencies assigned to the BBC, - and allocate the Corporation^funds between the various servioes and various parts of thecountry; they will continue&apos;to decide the top staff appointments;and they will continue to speak for the organisation as a whole.The Director-General, as Chief Executive, with the support of acommittee of senior staff members very much on the lines ofthe present Board of Management, will be responsible to theBoard of Governors for the co-ordination of policy on mattersaffecting the BBC as a whole and the overall management of theCorporation.5*7    The Government proposes, however, that there should beseparate Service Management Boards for each of the three services -a Television Service Management Board, a Radio Service ManagementBoard, and an External Services Management Board.     By delegatingto these boards many of the management functions which now restwith them, the Board of Governors will be enabled to concentrate ontheir supervisory and public accountability role, a role which willgive them a function and personality distinct from that of theService Management Boards.     Each Service Management Board will beresponsible to the Board of Governors collectively for supervising theprogramme strategy and management of its service.     News gathering,engineering, personnel management and finance will continue to beprovided as common services, but the new arrangement will bringabout the conditions for greater diversity between services asregards programme making and the approach to news and current affairs.5*8    The chairman of each Service Management Board will be a memberof the Board of Governors, and will be appointed as such.     Abouthalf of the members of each Service Management Board will be peopleappointed by the Home Secretary, after consultation with the Chairmanof the Board of Governors, drawn from outside the professional 6taffof the BBC, of standing and independence with experience or quali-fications which fit them to make a positive and distinctive contri-bution to the work of the Boards.   The Managing Director, whois in charge of day to day management 01 his service and will reportto the Board concerned, his deputy and the relevant channelControllers will be members of the
Service Management Boards for their respective services.The Director-General will be a member of all three boards.It will be open to each Service Management Board to inviteother people, for instance members of the National BroadcastingCouncils, Regional Controllers and other 6enior staff (suchas those in charge of common services) to attend their meetingsas necessary.5.9     The present Royal Charter govening the BBC expireson 31 July 1979*   The Government intends to apply for a newRoyal Charter thereafter which will include provision for theestablishment, composition and appointment of the ServiceManagement Boards.   The Government considers that, havingregard to the appointment of the chairmen of the ServiceManagement Boards as Governors of the BBC and also to   theproposals in Chapter 8 for public hearings, there can be noreduction in the number of Governors: on the contrary, itmay prove necessary to increase the number beyond the presenttv/elve in the light of experience.   The Government alsointends to enter into discussions with the Board of Governorsimmediately to see whether it is possible to introduce anyof these changes before 31 July 1979-   The changes proposedin this chapter should not in themselves increase the numbersemployed by the BBC or add significantly to its costs.   Norshould they affect employment relationships as the Corporation,not the new Boards, will continue to be the employer.5-10   The Royal Charter enables the BBC to appoint advisorycommittees to advise it on various aspects of its functionsand the services for which it is responsible.   The Board ofGovernors consider, and the Government agrees, that thesecommittees have worked well and that they should continue asan integral part of BBC broadcasting in this country.
CHAPTER 6:   TILE IBA6.1     The Government takes the opportunity of thi6 V/hite Paperto associate itself with the Annan Committee1s general praise of theperformance of the IBA.     The Committee saw a marked improvement inthe quality of independent television programmes over the past decadeand considered that the increased influence of the Authority had beenan important factor in this improvement.   Moreover,under the direction of the Authority, independent local radio hasbeen established and has achieved a remarkable following during thefew years of its existence.6.2    The Government considers that the IBA should continue to beresponsible for a television service and a local radio serviceprovided through programme contractors;   and that it should assumeresponsibility for the supervision of cable television and radioservices, including community cable services and pilot schemes ofpay-television, and such other services as hospital and universityservices.       In view of these responsibilities it would not be -appropriate to change the name of the Authority to &quot;RegionalTelevision Authority&quot;, as recommended by the Annan Committee.     TheAuthority will therefore continue to be known as the IndependentBroadcasting Authority.6.3    The powers and duties of the IBA in relation to the televisionand local radio services for which it is now responsible will remain,subject to the modifications described in Chapter 12, substantiallyas set out in the Independent Broadcasting Authority Act 1973*The Government attaches particular importance to the Authority1sduty to secure that the programmes broadcast from any stationcontain a suitable proportion of matter designed to appeal specifi-cally to the tastes and interests of people served by the station.To the powers and duties in the 1973 Act will be added the furtherpowers and duties (set out in Chapter 13) which will be necessary toenable the Authority to take on the new functions to be assignedto it.     The Government is also reviewing, in consultation with theIBA, various matters concerning the Authority&apos;s future financialbasis.6.**    The 1973 Act enables the IBA to appoint advisory committees toadvise it on various aspects of its functions and the services forwhich it is responsible.     The Authority considers, and the Govern-ment agrees, that these committees have worked well and that theyshould continue as an integral part of independent broadcasting inthis country&quot;.    SECRET
7.1     The Annan Committee made a number of recommendationsconcerning the arrangements for broadcasting in Scotland,Wales and Northern Ireland.    The Government has approachedthese issues on the basis that it must retain its fundamentalresponsibility to Parliament for the use of the frequencyspectrum and for the v/ay in which broadcasting is organisedin the United Kingdom as a whole.   It considers it desirable,however, to strengthen in certain ways the existing provisionsin the governing instruments of the BBC and the IBA for dealingwith the special needs of Scotland, Wales aid Northern Ireland,and to introduce a Welsh language service on the fourthchannel in Wales.7-2    Under their respective governing instruments, the BBCand the IBA are required to ensure that programmes broadcastto Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have regard to thedistinctive culture and tastes and, where appropriate, thelanguage of the people in those parts of the United Kingdom;one Governor of the BBC and one Member   of the Authority isappointed as having special responsibility for each area,Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and there are alsonational advisory bodies.7.3    Broadcasting has an important role to play in thepreservation of Gaelic and Welsh as living tongues and insustaining the distinctive cultures based upon them.   InScotland, the extent to which Gaelic can be increased islimited by the fact that, although Gaelic speakers arev/idely scatttered, they constitute a small minority of thepopulation.   Nevertheless the broadcasting authorities havea clear responsibility to ensure that the needs of thissection of the community are met and the Government truststhat they will take note of the view expressed by the AnnanCommittee that there should be some increase in the outputof Gaelic programmes, particularly educational programmes
and programmes for   children.   In Wales there are specialneeds of a different kind and these are discussed in paragraphs7.11 to 7.17.The BBC7.4     The Government agrees with the Annan Committee that,while the BBC should remain the main national instrument ofbroadcasting in the United Kingdom, it should also haveresponsibility for providing services which cater for theparticular needs of the people in Scotland, Wales and NorthernIreland.   The importance of this role is reflected in theappointment of National Governors for Scotland, Wales andNorthern Ireland to the Board of Governors and in the existenceof National Broadcasting Councils for Scotland and Wales.    (TheBBCs Royal Charter contains provision for the establishmentof a National Broadcasting Council for Northern Ireland.This provision has not been used hitherto though there is aNorthern Ireland Advisory Council.)   The principal functionsof the National Broadcasting Councils are to control the policyand content of television and radio programmes provided by theCorporation specifically for reception in Scotland and Walesand to advise the Corporation on matters relating to otherBBC broadcasting services which affect the interests ofScotland and Wales.7-5     The Government is firmly of the view that, in the interestsof the efficiency and economical management of the wholeCorporation, responsibility for the broad allocation of resourceswithin the BBC must remain with the Board of Governors.   However,the Government agrees v/ith the Annan Committee that a greaterdegree of autonomy should be given to the National BroadcastingCouncils.   In particular, they should be allocated money forprogrammes made specifically for transmission in Scotland andWales and should themselves decide how to divide this allocationbetween radio and television.   They should have an annualbudget for minor capital investment.   It would also beappropriate for the National Broadcasting Councils to be
consulted by the Board of Governors about the appointmentof the Controller Scotland and the Controller Wales (v/hoserole will not be diminished in consequence of the changesproposed in Chapter 5)&apos;,   also about the appointment of the executiveheads of radio and television and Scotland and Wales.7.6     Although the National Broadcasting Councils have workedwell, the Government considers the increased responsibilitiesv/hich these arrangements will entail for them ought to bereflected in the manner of appointment of their members.The BBCs Royal Charter provides for the members to beselected for appointment by the Corporation by a panel of theBBCs General Advisory Council.   The Government considers thatin future arrangements comparable with those proposed inChapter 5 for the appointment of lay members of the Boardsof Management for BBC Radio, BBC Television and the ExternalServices should apply to the appointment of members of theBroadcasting Councils.   Each Council v/ill therefore bereconstituted so as to comprise the relevant National Governoras chairman and a number of between 8 and 11 lay members whowill be appointed by the Home Secretary after consultationswith the Secretary of State for Scotland or Wales as appropriateand with the Chairman of the Board of Governors.   The laymembers will be persons of standing and independence withexperience or qualifications which fit them to make a positiveand distinctive contribution to broadcasting services inScotland or Wales.   As indicated in paragraph 5*8, it will beopen to the new Boards of Manageoent for radio and televisionto invite members of the National Broadcasting Councils andRegional Controllers to attend their meetings as necessary.7.7    The National Broadcasting Councils will continue to berequired to present annual reports to the Board of Governorsfor inclusion in the Corporation^ annual report.   It is rightthat the Councils&apos; annual reports should be made availableto the members of the   proposed   Scottish and Welsh Assembliesbut it would be inappropriate to require them to be laidformally before the Assemblies when broadcasting is not to be a
devolved matter.   It will also be appropriate for the NationalBroadcasting Councils to participate in the public hearingswhich the BBC will be required to hold in Scotland and Wales,and perhaps to conduct those hearings on behalf of theCorporation.   If a National Broadcasting Council were to beestablished for Northern Ireland, it would be appropriate forit to be constituted in the way proposed above for the NationalBroadcasting Councils for Scotland and Wales.The IBA7.8     The IBA&apos;s television services in Scotland, Wales andNorthern Ireland are provided by separate programme contractors.Three Members of the Authority are appointed to make theinterests of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland respectivelytheir special care and they are the chairmen of the IBA&apos;sAdvisory Committees for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.These Committees have been established by the Authority underits general pov/ers to set up Advisory Committes under section 10of the Independent Broadcasting Authority Act 1973-     Althoughthe present arrangements have worked well, the Governmentconsiders that they do not fully reflect the importance ofthe work of these bodies.    It proposes, therefore, to includein its forthcoming legislation specific provision for theestablishment of Advisory Committees to advise the Authorityon matters relating to the services, both television and radio,for which it is responsible in Scotland, Wales and NorthernIreland.   The Government considers that in future the AdvisoryCommittees for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland should beappointed by the Home Secretary after consultation with theSecretary of State for Scotland. Wales and Northern Ireland, asappropriate, and with the Chairman of the Authority.   TheNational Members of the Authority will continue to be the chairmenof these Advisory Committees.7.9     The Advisory Committees will be required to present annualreports on the operation of independent television and local radio
in their transmission areas to the IBA for inclusion in theAuthority&apos;s annual reports. The Committee&apos;s annual reportswill be made available to the members of the Scottish andWelsh Assemblies but, for the reason given in paragraph 7-7above, it would not be appropriate to require these reportsto be laid formally before the Assemblies.The 03A7.10   As indicated in paragraph 3-8  provision will be madefor advisory committees to advise the OBA on various aspectsof the fourth channel service, including, as and whenregional variations become feasible, regional aspects of theservice.Welsh lanr^iage service7.11   There is need for early action to help to preserve thedistinctive Welsh language and culture by increasing Welshlanguage television broadcasting.    The Government is committedto the project for a fourth television channel in Wales givingpriority to a service in the V/elsh language, but economiccircumstances have not so far enabled provision to be madefor the necessary expenditure.    In deciding how progresscan be made when resources are available, the Government hasbeen assisted by the report of the Home Office Working Partyon the project, which it received on 29 June.7-12   As indicated in paragraph 3-1 5, the engineering of thefourth channel will be undertaken by the IBA and it will take atleast three years to bring the fourth channel to most of thepopulation in V/ales from the time that authorisation is given.The Government considers that the establishment of the Welshlanguage service should have a priority second only to thecontinuing extension of UHP television coverage (seeparagraphs 1*t.*f and 1*t.5)-   It intends to begin discussionsimmediately with the broadcasting authorities with theintention of bringing the new service into operation v/itha potential coverage of about 90 per cent of the populationof V/ales in the autumn of 1982.   The Government considers thatonce the service begins, Welsh language television broadcasting
should be concentrated on the fourth channel.   This solutionwill inevitably mean that viewers in Wales will lose part ofthe fourth channel service provided by the OBA for the restof the United Kingdom, though it may be possible to reduce theloss to some extent by skilful scheduling arrangements.Such a solution will not please all viewers in Wales but,given that a fifth television channel for Wales is not apractical possibility, it seems to be the best way of reconcilingthe conflicting desires of V/elsh and non-Welsh speaking viewers.7.13   The existing broadcasting organisations have considerableexperience of the special problems of broadcasting in Walesand are the only producers of substantial quantities of Welshlanguage programmes at the present time.   While it is possiblethat other sources of Welsh language programmes might in duecourse be found by the OBA. it has always been assumed thatmuch the greater part of a regular Welsh language televisionservice would need to be provided by the BBC and the IT/programme company for Wales.   It would be wrong, moreover,to treat the V/elsh language service in isolation fromEnglish language programmes originating in Vales, whetherthese come from the BBC, from the independent system or fromthe OBA.   For these reasons, the Government considers thatit would not be appropriate to treat the Welsh languagetelevision service on the fourth channel as a service to beprovided and supervised exclusively by the OBA: it shouldbe treated as a national service for Wales to which allthree broadcasting organisations will have an identifiablecontribution to make and with the management of which allthree broadcasting authorities will need to be associated.Provision will therefore be made for the BBC and the IBAto provide the fourth channel service with a given number ofhours of V/elsh language programmes which will stimulate andmaintain interest in the language; and for the 03A to provideprogrammes in the Welsh language which it will have commissioned.There will be opportunities to modify the service from time to
time so as to take account of the use which is made of itand the financial and physical resources of the broadcastingorganisations.   There will also need to be some understandingbetween the broadcasters about the times at which Welshlanguage programmes should be broadcast.7.1^   It will be essential, however, for the contributions tothe Welsh language service and its scheduling to be co-ordinatedand for there to be some organisation responsible for settingthe broad objectives of the Welsh language service.   TheGovernment proposes to include in its forthcoming legislationprovision for the establishment of a Welsh Language TelevisionCouncil which will consist of representatives of BBC-V/ales,the Welsh independent television contractor, the IBA and theOBA.   Since the OBA will be responsible for the fourth channelas a whole,  the Government proposes that one Member   of the OBAshould be designated by the terras of his appointment to be thechairman of the Council, and he will be appointed by the HomeSecretary in consultation with the Secretary of State for Wales.It will also be essential to monitor the use which is made ofthe Welsh language service, and it may be appropriate for theCouncil to conduct, from time to time, public hearings on theservice which it will be responsible for co-ordinating.7.15   The Siberry Working Party considered that on grounds ofservice identity and ability to compete with the other televisionservices, there would be little point in starting the Welshfourth channel service of less than 25 hours a week ofWelsh language programmes could be provided.   At the presenttime, the broadcasting organisations between them provide weekly some12-J hours of Welsh language television broadcasting, and theBBC had an additional two hours a week in prospect.   The Home OfficeWorking Party estimated that the cost of providing theadditional programme material required for a Siberry serviceat 1978 prices would be about  1*1 million in capital costs,since investment in additional studios would be involved, andabout  8-5 million in annual revenue costs.   There are
difficulties, in 1978 as there were in 1975 when theSiberry Working Party reported, in adding to the plannedlevels of public expenditure.    Moreover, too rapid expansioncould adversely affect the quality of programmes.   The HomeOffice Working Party saw a need to prepare for a V/elshlanguage service in a smooth and controlled way and identifiedvarious possibilities for providing extra programmes for aV/elsh language service starting in about three years time ata level of about 20 hours a v/eek.   The Government agrees thatin all the circumstances and in view of the need to get theproject started, it would be desirable to begin the serviceat a somewhat lower level than envisaged in the Siberryproposals, adding    to it from time to time as appropriate.A weekly television service of some 20 hours would involvean increase of nearly 75 per cent in the hours at presentbroadcast in the V/elsh language.7.16   The Government accepts that it may have to help to meetthe costs of providing the additional programme materialfor the service.   It proposes to take the BBC share of thecost of additional Welsh language programmes into account infuture reviev/s of the level of the licence fee.   It is envisagedthat the OBA will in due course be able to buy additionalWelsh language programmes required for the service from theITV programme contractor for Wales, in the same way as it wouldbe able to buy programmes from an independent producer.7-17   The Home Office Working Party also identified certainpossibilities, if finance could be made available, of increasingV/elsh language television broadcasts for children on theexisting channels, pending the introduction of the V/elshlanguage service.   The Government will explore with the broad-casting organisations how far it will be possible to introducethese programmes within a year or so without, however, riskingthe introduction of the service on the fourth channel in 1982.
Local radio7.18   The Government agrees with the Annan Committee that theopening of local radio stations in all parts of Scotland,including the Highlands and Islands, should be placed highon the list of priorities for the expansion of local radio.It also considers that the opening of stations in V/ales,particularly Cardiff, should similarly be regarded as amatter of priority.
SECRET 33CHAPTER 8: THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE BROADCASTING AUTHORITIES8.1    Among the proposals which the Annan Committee considered -but rejected - for improvements in the accountability of thebroadcasting authorities were proposals for a single authority,or for a council or commission, set over the authorities tosupervise them.      The Government considers that to establish any6uch body would constitute either a return to monopoly controlof broadcasting or a separation of the final responsibility forproviding a broadcasting service from the final responsibilityfor what i3 broadcast on that service.     In either case there couldbe a threat to the independence of the broadcasters.     A singleexecutive body would concentrate power in too few hands, while abody with supervisory responsibilities for broadcasting, but withoutthe duty actually to provide programme services, would tend to lessenthe sense of responsibility of those who have that duty and perhapsalso undermine their independence.      The Government believes thatthe broadcasters will be more accountable to the public if theycan discuss their services directly with members of the public.Public hearings8.2     It is for this reason that the Government accepts theAnnan Committee&apos;s recommendation that the broadcasting authoritiesshould from time to time conduct public hearings.     It is alsofor this reason, however, that the Government rejects the Committee&apos;sproposals for a Public Enquiry Board for Broadcasting.   Such a body,even if circumscribed in the way envisaged by the Committee, wouldtend to develop into a broadcasting council or commission, andits effect could too easily be to involve the Government andParliament in the day to day conduct of broadcasting.     TheGovernment believes that the creation of such a body would not bein the public interest.     This is not to say that broadcastinggenerally, and the performance of the broadcasting organisationsin particular, does not need to be periodically reviev/ed, or thatthere is no need for continuing research into broadcasting andits effects.      The Government considers, however, that suchreviews are best carried out by ad hoc committees, like theAnnan Committee.     It also accepts that, if such committees are
to be able properly to undertake such reviews, they must haveavailable a body of research.     The Government believes that themachinery for conducting this research can, and should, be left tothe broadcasting authorities.     It notes with particular approvalthe work which both the BBC and the IBA have done to identifyand follow up new projects of social research in broadcasting.8.3    The public hearings which the broadcasting authorities willbe required to hold will be of two kinds.     First, the BBC, theIBA and the OBA will be required to conduct public hearings indifferent areas of the United Kingdom to ascertain the views ofthe public on the services which each provides to these areas.Secondly, in each area in which a television or local radiofranchise is to be held, a public hearing will form part of thenormal procedure by which the IBA decides to which applicant toaward the contract.     The Government accepts, however, that someof the considerations which the Authority takes into account, suchas the financial viability of the proposals in an application,are not suitable for public discussion in that they relate to theprivate affairs of the applicant.     The Authority will also berequired to conduct public hearings in connection with anysignificant changes which it is minded to make to the franchiseareas.     In considering such changes the Authority will also berequired to pay special attention to links of community interest.The precise procedures for public hearings will need furtherconsideration and consultation, but it will be the intentionto keep them as simple as possible.Broadcasting Complaints Commission8.**    The Annan Committee considered that the present arrangementsfor dealing with complaints, the BBC&apos;s Programme ComplaintsCommission and the IBA&apos;s Complaints Review Board, do not commandpublic confidence, though they made it clear that they were notsuggesting that the existing complaints bodies were other thanscrupulous, judicious and impartial in reaching their decisions.The Government agrees and welcomes the Annan Committee&apos;srecommendation that an independent Broadcasting ComplaintsCommission should be established to consider complaints againstall the broadcasting authorities of misrepresentation or unjustor unfair treatment in   broadcast programmes and that the
Commission should also consider complaints about invasion ofprivacy during the preparation of programmes.   This recommendationcommands widespread support, and provision for the establishmentof such a Commission will be included in the Government&apos;s forthcominglegislation.   The Government has it in mind, however, to enlargein some respects the functions envisaged by the Annan Committeefor the proposed Commission.Complaints of misrepresentation and unjust and unfair treatment8.5.   As regards the Commission&apos;8 quasi-judicial functions inrelation to complaints of misrepresentation, unjust or unfairtreatment or invasion of privacy5   It will be for the Commissionitself to decide whether a particular programme constitutedmisrepresentation or unjust or unfair treatment within its terms ofreference, but it is envisaged that the interpretation should notbe narrowly or legalistically confined to cases of misrepresentingthe words or deeds of a particular individual or company and shouldbe extended to cover programmes which, taken as a whole, grosslymisrepresent or traduce people&apos;s actions and motives.   The Commissionwill consider such complaints only if they have been first put tothe appropriate broadcasting authority and the complainant isdissatisfied with the authority&apos;s response.   The Commission willtherefore send any complaint of this kind which it receives directfrom the complainant to the authority concerned and it will receivea report from the authority on the action taken.   If the complainantis dissatisfied with the reply he has received from the authority,the Commission will proceed to consider the complaint.   TheCommission^ adjudication will be published and it will be able,where it judges this to be appropriate, to require the broadcastingauthority concerned to publish and/or broadcast that adjudication.The Commission vail have discretion to refuse to consider acomplaint of this kind if it considers it to be frivolous ormalicious.
SECRET 36Tho lepal waiver8.6.   Under the existing arrangements for dealing with complaintsa person who wishes his complaint to &quot;be considered by the BBC&apos;sProgramme Complaints Commission is required, and a person who wishesto have his complaint considered by the IBA&apos;s Complaints ReviewBoard may be asked, to v/aive his right to institute legal proceedingsin connection with the complaint.   The Annan Committee consideredthat the waiver was an unjustifiable interference with individualrights but suggested only that the question of the waiver shouldbe looked at closely before the Broadcasting Complaints Commissionshould be established.   On the question of the legal waiverrequired in certain circumstances by the Press Council somemembers of the Royal Commission on the Press (whose Report waspublished as Cmnd 6310) were firmly of the view that, althou^i itmight be reasonable for the consideration of a complaint tobe postponed until after pending legal proceedings had beenconcluded, the waiver was not justified and should be done awaywith.   Other members believed that, although the objections inprinciple to the waiver were strong and the theoretical argumentsin its favour unconvincing, there was a practical argument for thewaiver in that its abolition might cause some editors to refuse toco-operate with the Press Council on some complaints.   The PressCouncil&apos;s waiver was also discussed in the Report of the YoungerCommittee on Privacy (Cmnd they concluded that although thewaiver might seem obnoxious it was an unavoidable feature of thePress Council&apos;s complaints system.   They noted, moreover, that itwas a common feature of binding arbitration proceedings.8.7*   The arguments on either side of the legal waiver are finelybalanced.   There is a strong case for saying that the right to havea complaint considered by an independent Broadcasting ComplaintsCommission established by law should be regarded as an alternative,rather than an addition, to the ordinary legal remedies, particularlysince an adjudication by the Commission will be published and, insome cases, broadcast.   It is difficult to see, moreover, why acomplainant, having obtained a favourable adjudication from theCommission or, irrespective of the adjudication, information whichhe might not otherwise have obtained, should be able to use theadjucation or the information as a basis for instituting legalproceedings against the relevant authority or the persons who madethe programme in question.   It is arguable that the authorities,as public bodies, should not seek the protection of a waiver, but
much less clear that there should &quot;be no protection for the individualprogramme maker.   There is the further consideration notedby the Annan Committee, the Royal Commission on the Press   and theYounger Committee , that the Commission will need the co-operationof the broadcasting authorities and programme makers in order to beable to consider complaints:   the absence of a waiver may reducethis co-operation and thus impede the Commission in its task.   Forthese reasons the Government inclines to the view that there may becircumstances in which it will be appropriate for the complainantto be required, as a condition of having his complaint considered bythe Commission, to waive his rigfrt to institute legal proceedingsin connection with the case   at any rate against individualprogramme makers if not against the broadcasting authorityconcerned .   Eefore reaching a final conclusion on the question ofthe waiver the Government will wish to consider comments made onthese paragraphs of this White Paper.
Other matters within the Commissions remit8.8.   The handling of complaints of a more general natureconcerning, for instance, the excessive portrayal of violence,failure to observe the requirement of due impartiality in the&quot;broadcast of controversial matter, or an alleged &quot;breach of a codeof conduct promulgated by a broadcasting authority, raises ratherdifferent issues from those relating to complaints of misrepre sent ar-tion or unjust or unfair treatment.   The Annan Committee consideredthat complaints relating to the taste, content or standard ofindividual programmes or of programmes in general were properlymatters for the broadcasting authorities, and the Committee madevarious proposals (eg for public hearings) designed to ensure thatthe authorities were more open to such complaints than they had beenin the past.   In Chapter 10 the Government comments on obligationsof the broadcasting authorities in relation to programme standards,for example as respects the portrayal of violence and dueimpartiality.   Complaints of this kind amount to many thousandsover a year:   they can range from the expression of an individualand highly personal view to the expression of views which seem tocommand widespread public support.   Moreover the existence of anindependent Broadcasting Complaints Commission may be expected toencourage the public to direct complaints of these more generalkinds to it.   No single organisation could respond quickly tocomplaints of this kind without a large and expensive staff tomonitor programmes and deal with correspondence.   Moreover, if theCommission were to attempt to substitute its judgment for that ofthe broadcasting authorities as regards the taste, content orstandards of individual programmes, it would come close toassuming part - probably an increasing part - of their responsibil-ities for the day to day conduct c    jroadcasting.   On the otherhand, the Government believes t; ere is public concern aboutsome general issues, to which tl.      oadcasting authorities have notalways responded adequately.   It (     ;iders therefore that therewould be merit in giving the Broad  -sting Complaints Commission,in addition to its responsibilities for adjudicating on individualcomplaints of misrepresentation and unfair treatment, someresponsibility for reviewing, and commenting from time to time,on the nature of, and trends revealed in, the other complaints itwill undoubtedly receive about the failure to observe acceptablestandards by the broadcasting authorities.   However, the
Commission&apos;8 role here will be to comment on general issues andgeneral trends rather than concern itself with particular complaintsand particular programmes.8.9*   The Government therefore proposes that the Commission shouldbe able to consider, and comment in its annual report, on issuesarising from complaints of a more general nature relating toprogramme standards, and on the broadcasting authorities1 responseto such complaints.   Where such complaints are received direct bythe Commission it will therefore pass them to the appropriatebroadcasting authority, which will reply direct to the complainant,sending a copy of its reply to the Commission.8.10.   The Broadcasting Complaints Commission will consist of achairman, and perhaps four to eight members in the first instance,who will be appointed by the Home Secretary.    It will employ suchstaff as are necessary.   The Commission will be financed from   -contributions from the BBC, the IBA and the OBA, and it v/ill decide,subject to the approval of the Home Secretary what procedures toadopt for the purpose of carrying out its functions.   The aim mustbe to ensure that these procedures are kept as simple and informalas possible.   The Commission will be required to publish an annualreport giving an account of the complaints of misrepresentation andunfair treatment it has received over the year and of the adjudica-tions it has made on them.   As indicated in paragraph 8.8, thereport will also contain a review of the more general complo-intsreceived during the year and the issues these raise.   TheCommissions report will be laid before Parliament.   The Governmentalso proposes to require the broadcasting authorities to publish intheir annual reports information about the volume and nature of thecomplaints they have received during the year and about the actionthey have taken in consequence.   Parliament and the public will beable to judge from the authorities and the Commissions annualreports how far the authorities obligations in relation toprogramme standards have been fulfilled.Annual Reports8.11.    It is central to the accountability of the broadcastingauthorities that they should produce annual reports for presentationby the Home Secretary to Parliament.   Information about the volumeand the nature of complaints about broadcast programmes and anyaction taken inC-n^JJjSSico is one of the items which the Government
considers should be included in these reports, but there are otherswhich will be common to all broadcasting authorities.   These aredealt with in the appropriate places in Part II of the White Paperand are summarised in paragraph 9,12.   It is the intention thatall the reports should be available at much the same time, thatis, as soon as possible after the end of the financial year on31 March.Statutory codification of the constitutional arrangements commonto all &quot;broadcasting authorities8.12.   A number of the basic constitutional arrangements whichgovern broadcasting in this country are the same for the BBC andthe IBA and will also apply to the OBA.   These are discussed inChapters 9 a&amp;d 1Q*   Moreover, several of the proposals in thischapter, for example that the authorities should conduct publichearings to ascertain the views of the public on the services forwhich they are responsible, will be applicable in the case of allthree authorities.   The Government considers that Parliament shouldhave the opportunity when the forthcoming broadcasting legislationis debated to consider and approve these common constitutionalarrangements for all three broadcasting authorities at the sametime.   This presents no difficulty in relation to the IBA which is,and the OBA which will be, bodies created and regulated by statute.The constitutional arrangements for the   BBC, however, are set outin ths Corporations Royal Charter, and also in its Licence andAgreement and related prescribing memoranda.   It is customary for adraft of the Royal Charter for which the Government intends toapply to be presented to Parliament, but the Charter itself is notsubject to any formal Parliamentary procedure.   The Licence andAgreement requires the approval of the House of Commons, nothowever because of the important constitutional arrangements whichit contains, but because it makes provision for the grant-in-aidfor the EBC&apos;s External Services and is therefore a contract whichis not binding unless approved by a Resolution of the House ofCommons (Standing Order No 96).8.13.   As indicated in Chapter 5 &quot;the Government considers that theBBC should continue to be a Royal Charter body.   It believes,however, that the constitutional arrangements which are common to allthree broadcast      authorities should be dealt with by statute.
The forthcoming broadcasting legislation will therefore containprovisions which will be common to the BBC, the IBA and the OBAon the following matters:(a)   the obligations which are common to all three authoritiesin relation to programme content, eg to secure dueimpartiality in the treatment of controversial matters andto exclude material which is offensive or likely to inciteto crime or disorder (paragraphs 10.2 and 10.3);(b) the duties which each authority vail have, to conductfrom time to time public hearings to ascertain the views ofthe public on their respective services (paragraphs 8.2 and8.3) and to prepare annual reports (paragraph 8.1l);(c) the Government1s powers to give directions to theauthorities in connection with programmes (paragraphs 9*9 and9*10), certain technical matters (paragraph 9*5)* financialforecasts (paragraph 9*ll)* and matters to be included in theauthorities1 annual reports (paragraph 8.12).jCLii^V^ Iff.
PART II:   OTHER ISSUESCHAPTER 9:   THE GQVEKNjMTCMS POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES9*1.   The Annan Committee, like their predecessors, considered thatthe Government and Parliament must have the power to decide thenumber and nature of the broadcasting services - who should providethem, how they should be financed and what priority should be givento them;   but that these powers should give the Government andParliament the minimum opportunity to intervene in the day to daybusiness of providing broadcasting services.   Under theconstitutional arrangements which govern broadcasting in thiscountry the Government has, subject only to Parliament, considerablepowers.   Parliament has vested the Government, through theWireless Telegraphy Acts, with the power to license all uses ofwireless telegraphy:   without a licence from the Home Secretaryneither the BBC nor the IBA could broadcast.   Moreover, theGovernment has the duty to propose such changes in the constitution,structure and organisation of broadcasting as seen from time totime to be necessary:   the Government applies for the Royal Charterby which the BBC is constituted and brings forward the legislationrelating to the IBA (and, in due course, the OBA).   This rolecarries with it fundamental responsibilities which no Governmentcan relinquish.   The question which is discussed in the next 11paragraphs of this chapter is what, if any, changes arenecessary to those of the Government&apos;s particular powers andresponsibilities which relate, or will relate, to the broadcastingauthorities.   These are considered under the following headings:(a) control over the use of frequencies and other technicalmatters;(b) the. appointment and dismissal of members of thebroadcasting authorities;(c)programmes;(d)financial matters;(e)annual reports of the broadcasting authorities.
9-2.   Both in its management of the national economy and in itsdirect financial responsible for the public sector, the Governmentis closely concerned with such matters as pay.   Where guidelinesare laid down by the Government the broadcasting authorities, withother organisations, are expected to observe them.   The Governmentalso determines the level of remuneration of the Governors of theBBC and the Members of the IBA.   It will also do so in due coursefor Members of the OBA, for the independent members of the BBCfsnew Broadcasting Service Management Boards and members of theComplaints1 Commission.   The levels of remuneration of the personsconcerned will be assessed, or re-assessed as the case may be, inthe light of their responsibilities under the proposals in thisWhite Paper and, of course, taking proper account of the requirementsof pay policy.Control over the use of frequencies and other technical matters9.3     Broadcasting is, whether in sound or television, but one ofmany services which use the radio frequency spectrum.     To easethe task of sharing the radio frequencies among the competingservices, the spectrum has been divided into bands which have,largely by international agreement, been allocated among thevarious services.     Once a band has been allocated on aninternational basis the frequencies it contains can be assignedfor use at particular strengths to transmitting stations.     TheHome Secretary has leading responsibility both for negotiationson behalf of the United Kingdom at an international level on theallocation of frequency bands to the various services, and forthe assignment of frequencies within the United Kingdom.     Inradiocommunications the principal international regulatorymechanism is the body of international Radio Regulationsestablished by the International Telecommunication Union.The Radio Regulations were last fully revised in 1959 and are tobe reviewed at the forthcoming World Administrative RadioConference (WARC) in Geneva in 1979-   In January 1977 the ;-HomeSecretary invited interested organisations and individuals tosubmit comments on the proposals which they considered theUnited Kingdom should make for the 1979    WARC.   These have allbeen considered and tentative United Kingdom proposals wererecently published by the Home Office Radio Regulatory Departmentin the paper Preparation for the World Administrative RadioConference 1979-
9.*f    As indicated in paragraph 9.1 the regulation of the useof the frequency spectrum in the United Kingdom is by licensingunder the Wireless Telegraphy Acts.     In addition to his generalpower to licence the use of wireless telegraphy for broadcasting,the Home Secretary has a number of specific powers.9*5    The Home Secretary&apos;s approval is required before the BBC orthe IBA can establish or use any wireless telegraphy station orinstal or use any wireless telegraphy apparatus;   and he has powersto give directions to the Corporation and the Authority, for example,to establish additional stations, to use or cease using specifiedtechnical measures or processes, and to share transmitter sites.The present powers of Government over the technical aspects ofbroadcasting will be retained, and will apply, as appropriate,to the OBA.     The Government will of course also retain powersover technical matters in relation to other uses of the radiofrequency spectrum and in relation to wired distribution systems.^Broadcasting Technical Advisory Committee9.6    The Annan Committee recommended that a new TelecommunicationsAdvisory Committee should be established to advise the Governmenton the prospects for, and implications of, technical developmentsfor all telecommunications, including broadcasting /jjj.   Theyenvisaged that the Committee would subsume the functions formerlycarried, out by the Television Advisory -Committee.    The Governmentconsiders, however, that a remit covering the whole field oftelecommunications would be much too wide for a single body, andthat, in any event, broadcasting, which possesses the uniquequality of addressing simultaneously the greater part of thepopulation in their 20 million homes, is too important to betreated simply as one  facet of telecommunications.      However,the Government believes that it should have an independent sourceof advice on the implications of technological developments forbroadcasting, and the Home Secretary will therefore establisha Broadcasting Technical Advisory Committee to consider, and advisehim on,problems which are from time to time remitted to it.     TheCommittee, on which the broadcasting organisations and other inters,ested bodies both inside and outside Government will be represented,will subsume the functions formerly carried out by the TelevisionAdvisory Committee, and the reports which it produces will normallybe published.
Appointment and dismissal of members of the broadcastingauthorities9*7    The Governors of the BBC and tho Members of the IBA have(and the Members of the OBA will have) the duty of providingtheir respective broadcasting services as public services inaccordance with the terms of their respective governing instruments.For the performance of these duties the authorities are answerableto Parliament, in part through the presentation of theirrespective annual reports to Parliament and in part by virtueof the Prime Minister1s responsibility to Parliament for theadvice he tenders to the Queen in Council as respects the appointmentand dismissal of Governors of the BBG&apos;, and the Home Secretary&apos;sresponsibility for the appointment and dismissal of the Membersof the IBA.    (As indicated in paragraph 3*8 , the Members of theOBA will also be appointed by the Home Secretary.)     These arrange-ments are fundamental to the way broadcasting in this country isorganised.   The Government agrees with the Annan Committee that themembers of all three broadcasting authorities should, as is nowthe case with the Governors of the BBC and the Members of the IBA,be appointed as persons, not as representatives, and thatappointments should normally be for a five year term.9.8    At present the powers to dismiss members of a broadcastingauthority are exercisable by Order in Council in the case ofGovernors of the BBC, and, in the case of Members   of the IBA, bynotice by the Home Secretary, copies of which must be laid beforeParliament.     The Annan Committee recommended that neither thechairman nor a majority of members of a broadcasting authorityshould be dismissed on policy grounds unless AffirmativeResolutions have been passed by both Houses of Parliament /K7It would be difficult tc formulate a satisfactory test ofdismissal on &quot;policy grounds&quot; but the Government agrees that thedismissal on any grounds of the chairman or a majority of membersof a broadcasting authority should be open to Parliamentaryscrutiny.     The Government undertakes, therefore, that shouldit ever consider it necessary to advise The Queen in Councilto dismiss a Chairman of the BBC or a majority of the Boardof Governors or to dismiss the Chairman or a majority of Membersof the IBA or the OBA, it would afford Parliament an opportunityto debate the matter.
M   fk4uPro graces9-9    The Annan Committee recommended that the present powers ofGovernment over programming should be retained and should apply to allbroadcasting authorities [l?J.   These paras are:   to prescribe thehours of broadcasting; to require the broadcasting of announcementsin connection with the functions of a Minister of the Crown;   torequire the broadcasting of any other matter in an emergency;to veto any particular broadcast or class of broadcast;   and toprevent the making of exclusive arrangements for the broadcastingof sporting or other events of national interest.     Subject towhat is said in the next paragraph, the Government accepts thisrecommendation.9.10   As the Annan Committee observed, the Government&apos;s power ofveto is the one which poses the greatest threat to the independenceof the broadcasting authorities.    It has never been used toprevent a particular programme or series of programmes from beingbroadcast.     It is currently the basis on which the BBC is requiredto refrain;from broadcasting expressions of its own views oncurrent affairs or matters of public policy and from usingsubliminal techniques to convey messages etc - matters which forthe IBA are dealt v/ith in section M2) and (3) of the IndependentBroadcasting Authority Act 1973-     (Under the proposals in para-graphs 8.12 and 8. 13, these requirements will be incorporatedfor the BBC, the IBA and the OBA in the Government&apos;s forthcomingbroadcasting legislation.     Some modifications to these require-ments are proposed in paragraphs 10.9 to 10.14 concerning thebroadcasting of the views of the authorities, or their membersor officers.)     Successive committees which have considered thematter have concluded that the power of veto should be retained, andthe Annan Committee believed that the existence of the power gavethe broadcasters greater security from undue pressure than theywould have if it were removed.     The Government agrees butconsiders that any exercise of the power should be open topublic scrutiny.     The right which the broadcasting authoritiesnow have to announce that they have been directed not to broadcastany particular matter will therefore be retained.    In additionthe Government proposes that the exercise of the power of vetois of sufficient importance that, in all cases   except thosein which a direction is given for reasons of national security ,a copy of the direction to the relevant broadcasting authorityshould be laid before each House of Parliament.
Financial matters9.11   The Governmenfs powers in relation to financial mattersincMe  the following :-(a) the power to prescribe the broadcast receiving licencefees (discussed in Chapter 11);(b) the power to require the BEC and IBA to provideforecasts of expenditure and income;(c) the power to alter the rate of the levy on theprofits of the independent television contractors;to require in certain circumstances additional levypayments by any independent television contractor;and to require the payment of specified amounts fromthe profits of the independent local radio contractors;(d) the power to give directions to the IBA on any matterrelating to the establishment and management ofreserve funds for radio and television, and on thedisposal of surplus revenue;(e) the Governmenfs consent is required before the BBCcan exercise its powers to borrow up to  20 ra. for thepurpose of defraying capital expenditure, and asrespects the period within which borrowings are repaid.(The Corporation also has power to borrow up to  10 m.for the purpose of obtaining temporary bankingaccommodation.     The exercise of this power and theperiod within which such borrowings are repaid arenot subject to consent.)As the Annan Committee observed, these powers enable the Governmentto exercise some general control in the national interest over thetotal financial resources available for broadcasting, but not tointervene in day to day management.     The Government agrees and,subject to what is said in paragraphs *t.l5 (levy on the independentlocal radio companies&apos; profits) and 11.8 (BBC&apos;s borrowing powers),will retain these powers, which will be extended as appropriate tocover the OBA.
Review of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 19^99.13   A number of the powers noted above derive from theWireless Telegraphy Acts.   The Government is examining whetherany amendments are needed to these Acts, in particular theprovisions on broadcast:      receiving licences in the light ofthe decision of the Court of Appeal in the Congreve case(1976 1 All ER 697, I976 2 MLR 291).Annual Reports of the Broadcasting Authorities9*12   As indicated in- paragraph 8. 11 it is central to theaccountability of the broadcasting authorities to Parliamentthat they should prepare annual reports for presentation-..toParliament.   The Home Secretary has power to require the BBCand the IBA to include certain specified information in theirrespective reports.      This power will be retained and will beextended to cover the OBA.   It is the Government&apos;s intention,moreover, that the power should be used to require the authoritito include in their annual reports information on the followingmatters :-(a) the volume and nature of complaints received duringthe year about programmes and the action taken inconsequence (paragraph 8.        and(b) the public hearings conducted by the authoritiesduring the year (paragraph 10);    and(c) the number of nature of the occasions on whichthe views of the broadcasting authorities onbroadcasting matters, or the views of any of theirmembers or officers, have been broadcast on theirrespective services (paragraphs 10.11 to   10.13).
xPi PPTCHAPTER 10: THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE BROADCASTING ORGANISATIONSPROGRAMME SThe obligations of the broadcasting authorities in relation toprogrammes and programme standards10.1   As indicated in Chapter 2, the Government regards thequality and range of programmes as the principal criterion bywhich our broadcasting system needs to be judged.     The provisionand content of programmes are the responsibility of the broad-casting authorities, and their independence in matters ofprogramme content is central to the constitutional arrangementsfor broadcasting in the United Kingdom.     This independence carrieswith it certain obligations as to programmes and programmestandards and for the IBA these are set out in sections 2(2),h and 5 of the IBA Act 1973-     The obligations of the BEC, mostof which correspond with those of the IBA, are set out in itsRoyal Charter, in Ministerial prescriptions under Clause 13C0of the Corporations Licence and Agreement and in a letter of19 June 196*4 from the then Chairman of the BBC, Lord Normanbrook,to the Postmaster General.     (The contents of this letter arenoted in the prescribing memorandum under clause 13(*0 of theLicence and Agreement).     As paragraphs 3-6 and 3*7 explain, theGovernment proposes to apply to the OBA all but one of theobligations which are at present laid on both the BBC and theIBA in relation to programme content.     The exception will bethe obligation to provide a &quot;proper balance&quot; of programmes.10.2   The main obligations which aro common to the existingbroadcasting authorities in relation to the services andprogrammes they provide are set out in the table below.

(This obligation has been modified by the Independent Broadoaating Authority Act 1578 - see paragraph 10.14) (aection 4(2))&quot;) Each Authority must enaure that progranaes do not include any technical device to convey messages to, or Nuance, nembera of an audienco vithout their being avcro of vhat ia being done. ^material prescription under clause 13(0 of                        (aootion 4(3)) ^Licence and Agreement)	^) Each Authority oust enaure that proper proportions of programaea are of British origin and British fcrforsaneo.

P*A Horoanbrook&apos;8 lettor)	(7b)   The IBA ia required to drav up, from time to time review, and secure compliance vith, a code of guidance on the rules to be observed in regard to the portrayal of .violence and such other natters concerning programme atandarda and practice aa it considers suitable for inclusion in the codo.   In draving up tho cede tho IBA must have particular regard to programmes broadcast vhen largo numbers of children and young persona may be expected to be vatohing or listening. (section 5(1)).
10.3   The Government is in general agreement with the AnnanCommittee&apos;s recommendation that the broadcasting authorities&apos;present obligations on programme content should be retained[109].     But the Committee also suggested a number of amendmentsto particular obligations.     The Committee examined the way inwhich the IBA exercised its powers in relation to programme contentand concluded that, although these powers should be retained, theAuthority should 6eek to intervene less frequently in thepreparation of individual programmes.    In its observations onthis recommendation the IBA has commented :-Under the IBA Act the Authority has editorialresponsibility for the content of its services.If its obligations are to stay unaltered, it mustcontinue to fulfil them.   There will always be roomfor argument about the wisdom of particular interventions,but the fact remains that the Authority has to exercise itsjudgment and to take responsibility.The Government agrees with the Authority on this matter.The portrayal of violence and related questions10.*f   The programme issue which has caused most concern tothe public is the portrayal of violence on television and itseffects.      The Government is aware of the arrangements forresearch which are being made, both separately and jointly,by the BBC and the IBA, and, in particular, for research onthis important subject.     The effects of television programmeson viewers are of their nature difficult to determine.   However,in the Governmenfs view, the only safe course is for thebroadcasting authorities to assume undesirable effects unlessconvincing evidence to the contrary emerges.      This meansthat the authorities must be cautious in broadcasting programmes,particularly programmes in which violence is portrayed,   ifthese might have effects on susceptible people, especiallyyoung people and children.
The B3C and the IBA are alert to the dangers, but the Governmentbelieves that they should both review their codes and guidance onthe portrayal of violence in the light of the comments made in thisWhite Paper, and should then publish these, if possible with theirnext annual reports.   The codes and guidance should be subject toregular review thereafter.     The Government will ensure that the OBA,when it is set up, prepares and publishes its own codes and guidanceon the subject.10.5   The Government also endorses the spirit of the Annan Committee&apos;srecommendation that the broadcasting authorities should monitor theamount of violence in their programmes and should publish regularlytheir findings, and report thereon.     There are problems inreaching a strict definition of violence which can be universallyapplied but the Government proposes to discuss with the BEC and theIBA how this recommendation (which will also be applied to the OBA)can best be given effect.    It should be possible to include asection on this subject in the annual report that each authoritywill be required to lay before Parliament.10.6   There is evidence that many children spend a great deal oftime watching television and that their choice of programme isnot always supervised by their parents.     It is known, moreover,that there is no time of the evening when there are not somechildren viewing, perhaps even in quite substantial numbers, thoughthere is a progressive decline throughout the evening in theproportion of children present in the audience.     It would not bereasonable to require the broadcasters to ensure that no materialthat might be considered unsuitable for children was broadcast atany time.   However, while the Government endorses the Annan Committeesrecommendations that the BBC and the IBA should continue to operatea policy of not showing before 9 pm television programmes whichmay be unsuitable for children, it does not consider that thebroadcasting authorities are entitled to assume that the entireresponsibility for protecting children after 9 pa can be safelyleft to the parents.   Although parents should take the primaryresponsibility thereafter - and more particularly the later inthe evening it gets - the Government considers that the broadcastingauthorities should always have regard (as the IBA is now requiredto have regard) in planning their programmes to the likely natureof the audience at a particular time.
10.7   The Government sympathises with the intention behind theAnnan Committee^ recommendations that the original classificationgiven by the British Board of Film Censors to a film should beshown when it is broadcast [11*0 end that a warning symbol shouldbe given in programmes likely to disturb a number of viewers [116].Both the recommendations were designed to enable viewers to protectthemselves from receiving broadcasts which they, or those in theirfamily, might find highly objectionable.     However, there is someevidence that to give a warning in this v/ay would sometimespositively attract viewers, which would be contrary to the objectof the exercise.   The IBA has been conducting research into thesematters and in the light of this the Government will discuss withthe BBC and the IBA (and, when it is set up, the OBA) how practicaleffect might be given to the spirit of the recommendations.Due impartiality10.8   The Annan Committee recommended that the broadcastingauthorities should continue to ensure that so far as possiblecontroversial subjects are treated with due impartiality, whichthey distinguished from a mathematical balance of different views,neutrality or indifference.   They considered due impartialityto be composed of three elements - the expression of the widestpossible range of views and opinions, the taking into accountof the weight of opinion which holds those views and the factthat both the range of views and weight of opinion are constantlychanging.   The requirement of due impartiality is fundamentalto our concept of public service broadcasting, and the Governmentagrees with the Committee that it should be retained.   V/hile itagrees with the Committee that this requirement should not precludecommitted public affairs programmes from having a recognised placeon the broadcasting outlets [117]i this must not be at the expenseof the principle of due impartiality.Broadcasting of the views of the broadcasting organisations10.9   The present restrictions on the broadcasting of the viewsof the broadcasting organisations, described in items Ma) andMb) of the table in paragraph 10.2, flow from the principle thatthe broadcasters should treat controversial matters with dueimpartiality.     The Government agrees v/ith the Annan Committee
that the broadcasting organisations should not be able to use theirown services to advance their own views on general issues ofpublic controversy.     The principle embodied in the presentrestrictions conflict, however, with two other principles:the first is that there should be only the minimum of restrictionson the reporting of the news;   the second is, paradoxically, theprinciple of due impartiality.     It is questionable whether BBCNews should be prevented from reporting the views of the Corporation,or ITN the views of the IBA, its members or officers, or theprogramme companies or their directors, when these views would,but for the present restrictions, constitute part of a legitimateitem in a news bulletin, for example on this White Paper.     Moreover^it is difficult to secure due impartiality in a current affairsprogramme devoted to broadcasting policy if the views of thetransmitting authority or of the programme companies or theirdirectors cannot be advanced in the programme.10.10 There is another consideration.     As indicated inparagraphs 8.2 and 8.3i the Government intends to require theauthorities to conduct public hearings to ascertain the viewsof the public on the services for which they are responsible.In addition, the IBA will be required to incorporate publichearings into its procedures for determining applications forfranchises and reconsidering the boundaries of franchise areas.There could be advantage from the point of view of theiraccountability to the public if the authorities were to broadcastat any rate some of   or some parts of , these hearings, thoughthis is a matter for them.     However, during the course of suchhearings the authorities will need to express their own viewsand in some of the hearings conducted by the IBA the programmecontractors&apos; views are also likely to be put forward.     Unlesstherefore there is some relaxation of the present restrictions,both the BBC and the IBA may find it impossible to broadcast suchhearings.10.11 The Annan Committee recommended that the broadcastingauthorities and the  ,proggramme contractors should be allowedto express their own views on matters of broadcasting policyand broadcasting issues, but only in a programme, or series ofprogrammes, specifically devoted to the discussion of broadcastingor the mass media generally, and clearly labelled as such;   and
that it would be incumbent on the authority to ensure bhatopposing views were expressed in the same programme or series ofprogrammes [110],     The Government considers that this recommend-ation might represent a sensible compromise between the conflictingprinciples involved, though there may be a case for dispensingwith the present restrictions entirely in relation to newsprogrammes and programmes consisting of the public hearings v/hichthe authorities will be required to conduct.     If there is tobe any relaxation of the present restrictions it will be importantto monitor the effects.   The authorities would be required,therefore, to include in their annual reports information aboutthe number and nature of the occasions on which they broadcasttheir own views or the views of any of their programme contractors.10.12     The Annan Committee also recommended that the broadcastingauthorities should be permitted to broadcast the views of theirindividual members and of directors of the programme contractingcompanies on subjects of public controversy not related tobroadcasting on the services for which they have responsibility,provided that(a) they inform the relevant authority in advanceon each occasion;(b) no reference is made in the broadcast to theirbroadcasting responsibility;(c) no fee is payable /ill/The Government considers that, since the broadcasting authoritieshave the duty to secure due impartiality in the treatmentof controversial matters, they would be able to secure that anyrelaxation of the present restrictions on the broadcasting ofviews of individual members of the authorities or of thedirectors of the programme contracting companies would not beabused.     In these circumstances it seems unnecessary to retainthe present restrictions in relation to the views of members ofthe authorities or directors of programme contracting companieson broadcasting matters.     Moreover, there seems to be no reasonwhy there should not be some reference to the position held bya member or director who is participating in a programme if sucha reference is appropriate.     The Government is inclined to
agree with the Annan Committee that the appropriate authority-should be informed in advance when the views of one of itsmembers   or officers, or of a director of a programme contractingcompany are to be broadcast,though such a requirement might bedispensed with in  a news programme or if a publichearing   is   to be broadcast.     It also considers that it wouldbe preferable  if these individuals did not receive a fee forparticipating in a programme.       If the present restrictions wererelaxed in this way, the authorities would be required to includein their annual reports information about the number and natureof the occasions on which they have broadcast the views of theirmembers (or officers) or of directors of any programmecontracting company.10.13    The proposals in the preceding two paragraphs are provisionaland the Government will reach a final conclusion on them in thelight of comments on this White Paper.*10.1*f The restrictions in section **(2) of the IBA Act 1973on the broadcasting of the views of directors of the IBA&quot;s programmecontracting companies create difficulties where a candidate at ageneral or local election is such a director.     The restrictionsprevent the IBA from broadcasting the views of such a candidatewho, under section 9(1) o  the Representation of the People Act1969i can insist that during the run-up to an election none ofthe other candidates&apos; views are broadcast either.     TheGovernment considers that the   result which the combination ofsection M2) of the 1973 Act and section 9(1) of the 1969 Actcan produce is contrary to the public interest.     This resultwill be largely avoided if the above proposals for amending section^(2) of the 1973 Act are implemented, but the Government considersthat there is a strong case for excluding the provision which willreplace section M2) entirely in relation to broadcasts by electioncandidates in any period in which the combination of this provisionwith section 9(1) of the 1969 Act could produce undesirable results.* If the Independent Broadcasting Authority Bill, at present beforeParliament, receives the Royal Assent, these restrictions will beamended to exclude section M2) of the IBA Act 1973 in relation tobroadcasts by the IBA of Parliamentary and local authority proceedings.The Government would also exclude the corresponding restrictionson the 33C in relation to the broadcasting of such proceedings.
Proportions of programmes of 3ritish origin10.15    The Annan Committee recommended that the broadcastingauthorities should continue to ensure that proper proportionsof the programmes on their services are of British originand performance.     They believed that it was in the interests ofthe public, as well as of the indigenous broadcasters, that theBBC and ITV as the main outlets for television broadcasting shouldcontinue to produce the bulk of their programmes within their ownorganisations.     This gave them confidence to innovate, enabledthem to meet the particular needs and interests of the Britishaudience and to match their resources to these requirements.On the other hand the Committee did not consider that a compulsoryban or quota should be placed on foreign imports.     At the presenttime both the IBA and the BBC restrict the proportion of foreignmaterial shown on their channels to some l*f per cent.     There ispressure on the one hand from British programme companies, theiremployees and the broadcasting unions to reduce the proportionstill further and, on the other hand, from foreign interests toincrease it.     There are complex issues about the classificationof co-productions and about particular types of material withinthe total restriction.10.16    The IBA has recently been considering whether any changesare desirable in the existing arrangements in order to strengthenthe British elements in the schedules and to give added scopefor the talents of those working in the British television industry.This has involved discussion with the trade unions and theindependent television companies.     The Authority has taken intoaccount the benefits accruing from the use of foreign materialin British television, the proper interests of those who valuethe opportunity to sell programmes on the British market and theimportance of being able to export British television programmes.The Authority has not yet announced its conclusions on the changeswhich might be introduced or on their timing.     The Government,in the light of the Authority&apos;s considerations, will considerother relevant factors, including comments received on this WhitePaper and the United Kingdom&apos;s international obligations (includingthose under the EEC Treaty), and after further consultationwith the broadcasting authorities, whether any changes to theobligations are required in its forthcoming legislation.
SECRET 58Other programme   issues10.17   Of the remaining recommendations of the Annan Committee onprogrammes (Recommendations 119 to 1^8) seven call for commentfrom the Government.Party political and Ministerial broadcasts10.18    The Annan Committee recommended that party politicalbroadcasts need not be transmitted simultaneously on all televisionchannels except during General  Lection campaigns [122], and thatlocal radio stations should reflect the political life of theirlocalities by carrying some party political broadcasts [123]*The arrangements for party political broadcasts are presentlybased on an agreement between the broadcasting authorities andthe Labour, Conservative and Liberal Parties, the Scottish Nationa-list Party and Plaid Cymru.     The Government will, therefore,initiate through the usual channels discussions with the otherpolitical parties on these two recommendations.10.19    The Annan Committee recommended that the BBC should berelieved of its obligation to broadcast Ministerial statements onnon-controversial issues [22].     (There is no correspondingrequirement on the IBA, and the BBC*s obligation needs to bedistinguished from the duty which both authorities have tobroadcast such announcements as they may be required tobroadcast by a Minister of the Crown in connection with hisfunctions - see paragraph 9-9)*     The Committee expressed doubtsabout the need for Ministerial broadcasts on non-controversialissues to be encapsulated in separate programmes, and consideredthat such statements came best within the normal news and publicaffairs services of the broadcasters.     The Government does notaccept this recommendation.     Circumstances may well arise(as they have in the past) in which it is appropriate for aMinisterial statement on a matter of national importance,albeit not of a controversial nature, to be broadcast as adistinct programme by the BBC, as this country&apos;s main nationalinstrument of broadcasting.     The obligation on the BBC tobroadcast such statements will therefore be retained.
Educational broadcasting10.20    The Annan Committee recommended that educationalbroadcasting should continue to be carried on existing televisionoutlets, including those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland,that it should have a significant place on the fourth televisionchannel and on the additional VHF radio channel, and also a placeon local radio stations [12*0.     The Committee also recommendedthat the broadcasting organisations should continue to use theirfacilities to produce structured educational programmes whichshould be supported by the requisite printed literature [125]*The question of the use of additional VHF radio channels isconsidered in paragraph 1^.3*     Subject to this, the Governmentcommends these recommendations to the broadcasting organisations.10.21     The Government also agrees with the Annan Committee^rejection of proposals for a National Educational BroadcastingAuthority and for Regional Educational Broadcasting Authorities[126] and with their recommendation that the broadcastingauthorities should continue to be responsible for the co-ordinati&apos;of educational programming, and that they should provide adequateliaison between the broadcasters themselves and between theireducational advisory bodies [129].     Like the Annan Committeethe Government sees attractions in the proposals for a singleauthority to take charge of and co-ordinate these with othereducation resources.   Like the Committee, however, the Governmentrealises that such an authority could not be incorporated satis-factorily either in our broadcasting or in our educationalsystems.   The Government also agrees with the Committee thatproposals for Regional Educational Broadcasting Authoritiesmust for similar reasons by rejected.Films10.22    The relationship between the film and broadcastingindustries is among the matters which the Government is currentlyconsidering in the light of the Reports of the Interim ActionCommittee on the Film Industry under the chairmanship of SirHarold Wilson (the Committee has not yet concluded itsdeliberations) and in the light of the relevant comments inthe Annan Committee1 s Report.     In the Governmenfs view,
the broadcasting organisations should take proper account of theinterests of the film industry in this country.     It also takesthe opportunity of this White Paper to associate itself withthe Annan Committee&apos;s welcome for the support given by thebroadcasting industry to the film industry.COOPERATION BETWEEN THE BROADCASTING ORGANISATIONSSimultaneous broadcasting of the same event10.23    Section 23 of the IBA Act 1973 enables regulations to bemade to prevent the broadcasting organisations from makingexclusive arrangements for the broadcasting of sporting orother events of national interest.   This power has never beenused and the problem over the last few years has been thereverse:   on a number of occasions the same sporting events,particularly football,have been broadcast by both the BBC andthe IBA.   The authorities have, however, reached agreementon the alternation of coverage of some events, such as theRoyal Variety Performance.10.2^    The IBA suggested to the Annan Committee that theHome Secretary should have power to require the BBC and the IBAto share the coverage of sport and other national events whenboth organisations wish to cover them.   This is a matter for thebroadcasting authorities rather than for the Government.   Forthe Government to be cast in the role of arbiter on such matterswould involve it in programming issues to an extent v/hich wouldbe inconsistent with its proper role in broadcasting.     TheGovernment recognises, however, that many people are irritatedwhen both broadcasting authorities broadcast the same event atthe same time (particularly when it i3 a sporting event or seriesof events using precisely the same picture) and hopes that theauthorities - the BBC, the IBA and in due course the 03A - willfind ways of keeping these instances to a minimum.   This is amatter on which the public has a right to expect them to reach asensible agreement between themselves.   The Government considersthat the authorities might usefully include in their annual reportinformation about the number and nature of occasions on which thesame event has been broadcast by more than one of them at thesame time.   This will enable the Government, Parliament and thepublic periodically to take stock of the problem.
Audience measurement10.25    The Annan Committee recommended that the BBC and theIndependent Television Companies Association (PICA) should atonce devise a combined system for assessing audience ratingsfor all broadcast channels [170].     The Government is aware ofthe difficulties to which such a proposal gives rise and itwelcomes the recent agreement which has been reached betweenthe B3C and the ITCA concerning the sharing of audience researchdata.    It hopes that similar arrangements can be made, anddeveloped, between the BBC and the independent local radiocompanies, and also in due course between the BBC, theindependent television companies and the OBA.Programme journals10.26    The Annan Committee recommended that the broadcastingorganisations should be required to waive their copyright inprogramme information, if necessary on payment of an agreed fee,so that other publishers might be free to publish in advance fullschedules of broadcast programmes [173]*     The arguments here arefinely balanced, as is reflected in the fact that this was nota unanimous recommendation.     Having considered the matter,the Government is not persuaded that it would be justified inrequiring the broadcasting organisations to waive their copyrightin programme information.     However, the question arises asto whether their respective journals could carry not onlyinformation about the programmes on their own services butalso brief information about programmes on the other services.The Government appreciates that there are some formidable practicaldifficulties in this idea, but hopes nevertheless that thebroadcasting organisations will consider it further.10.27    Consideration will also need to be given to the questionof the publication of information about the programmes on thefourth channel.     This will be. a matter for the OBA.
10.23    The Annan Committee recommended that the profitsaccruing from the sale of programme journals should be shownseparately from other publishing activities in the accountsof the broadcasting organisations [17*0*     The Governmentagrees, and notes that the BBC and ITCA have raised noobjection to this recommendation.     It would seem appropriatefor this requirement to be laid on the BBC and the ITV companies,and also if necessary, on the OBA.
uCHAPTER 11:    THE BBC&apos;S FINANCES11.1   The main conclusions v/hich the Government has reached in thelight of the Annan Report about the future role and internalstructure of the BBC are set out in Chapter 5*   The proposalsdescribed in Chapter 7 (Scotland, V/ales and Northern Ireland),Chapter 8 (the accountability of the broadcasting authorities),in Chapter 9 (the Governments responsibilities in relation tobroadcasting) and Chapter 10 (the responsibilities of thebroadcasting organisations) are also relevant to the Corporation.The present chapter considers the other questions raised in theAnnan Report concerning the BEG on which it is appropriate forthe Government to comment.   These relate to the Corporationsfinances.The broadcast receiving licence fee11.2   The BBC is financed by the net revenue from the broadcastreceiving licence fees, by grant-in-aid for its external servicesand by the profits from the sale of BBC publications andprogrammes.   The BBC also has the capacity to borrow up to 30 million.   About 90 per cent of the Corporations revenuecomes from the broadcast receiving licence fee.
11*3   The Annan Committee made a thorough study of financingthe BBC through the broadcast receiving licence fee systemand the possible alternatives to it.     Theyspecifically rejected proposals for financing the BBC by directgrant from Government, ie through taxation, because they consideredthat this would undermine the Corporation^ independence andbecause they thought it unlikely that the Government would beprepared to find the necessary money.   They also rejected proposalsfor financing the BBC from any form of advertising [35].   Theyrecognised however, that the system of financing the BBC fromthe licence fee was not without its difficulties.   Until recentlyit was possible both to keep licence fee increases fairly smalland to make them infrequently.   This was largely because therevenue from the licence fee grew as more people acquired televisionsets in the post-War years, and more recently as people turnedto colour television for which the fee was higher.   In effect theincrease in the number of television sets kept the revenuebuoyant and so financed the growth of the BBC.   However, nearly60 per cent of licences are now for colour television and thequestion arises as to whether the licence fee can continue toprovide the Corporation with an adequate source of income in thelonger term.   The Government will continue to keep the matter underreview.   However, like the Annan Committee, it has reached theconclusion that the BBC should continue to be financed principallyfrom the revenue of the broadcast receiving licence [3*0-   TheGovernment is conscious of the difficulty of adding to the plannedlevels of public expenditure at the present time and considers itimpracticable to increase them by sums of the order of  300million a year.Administration of the licence fee system11.**   In the 1977-78 financial year administrative costs of thelicence fee system are estimated at  25-1 million out of  287million total licence fee revenue.   Of this  *f.6 million representsthe cost of issue; the remainder includes the cost of enforcementand interference investigation.    In comparison with othercountries this is a relatively cheap and cost effective system ofadministration, but the costs can only be kept at this level ifthe system remains simple and straight-forward.   Many suggestions
have been put forv:ard for more elaborate and sophisticated refundsystems, for arrangements for part-yearly renewals and for otheralterations.   Some of these appear to have merit, but effectcould be given to them only if the system were made a great dealmore complex.   This would inevitably increase the cost ofadministering the system and hence increase the level of thelicence fee.   It is for this reason that the Government agreeswith the Committee&apos;s recommendations that the licence fee shouldcontinue to be payable annually [391; and that the Home Office,the BBC and the Post Office should continue to simplify theenforcement procedures and should ensure that those which arecontinued are cost effective [40].   For similar reasons theGovernment is disposed to accept the Committee&apos;s recommendationthat no changes should be made in the present arrangements forrefunding licence fees[38].11.5   The Magistrates&apos; Association drew the Annan Committee&apos;sattention to certain difficulties regarding the enforcement of thelaw relating to television licences and made proposals designedto ensure that, so far as possible, the person actually responsiblefor an offence of unlicensed use of a television set is the oneprosecuted.   With this point in mind the Television LicensingOrganisation are reviewing their instructions to enquiry officers,and the Government will consider whether any legislative changesmight be needed.11.6   The Committee also recommended that the IBA and any otherauthorities transmitting television programmes should contributeto the cost of the collection and enforcement of the licencesystem [41] on the grounds that no one can see an ITV programmewithout incurring the legal liability to pay a licence fee, andthat the Post Office was obliged to spend money in collectingand enforcing the licence fee system.   The Government believes,however, with the BBC and the IBA, that it is difficult to sustainthis argument as it applies to the costs of collecting the fee,given that the revenue derived from the licence fees is tocontinue as the principal source of revenue for the Corporation.There is a case, however,  for requiring the IBA and the OBA tocontribute towards the cost of interference investigation which isat present borne on the licence fee, since this work benefits the
G6public in respect of the quality of reception of all broadcastingservices and thus also benefits all the broadcasting organisations.The Government proposes to discuss this with the BBC, the IBAand in due course the OBA; it also proposes to discuss with themwhether arrangements should be made for the IBA and the OBA tobear the cost of enforcement campaigns on their respectivechannels.Concessionary licences11*7   The Annan Committee recognised that any extension of freeor concessionary licences for old age pensioners and others couldresult in a substantial loss of revenue for the BBC, wouldcomplicate the administration of the licensing scheme and add toits costs.   Their recommendation that concessionary licences forold age pensioners and others should not be introduced [3&amp;] andthat the concessionary licence available to residents in someold people&apos;s homes should be phased out [37] stemmed in part fromtheir desire to keep the administration of the licence feesystem as simple as possible.   They also had in mind, however,the policy of successive Governments, including the presentGovernment, that it is preferable to help people in need withbenefits in cash rather than in kind.   The Government agrees thatfurther concessions should not be introduced.   The existing oldpersons&apos; home concession raises other issues.   The Committee itselfsaid:The licence was not available to residents in other types ofinstitutional premises, for example, homes for handicappedpeople.   Nor did it apply to accommodation for widows, andthis category included many almshouses.   The concessionbore no relation to the needs of people who received it.   Theproblems of definition and of deciding whether a particularhome was eligible or ineligible had given rise to mistakesin administering the licence which had caused resentment.Moreover, other elderly people who were not eligible for thelicence considered that it favoured those who were alreadyfavoured by living in a home or in accommodation with theservices of a warden.These are substantial criticisms.   The Government agrees, however,with the Annan Committee that it would be harsh to withdraw theconcession from those who now receive it.   To phase the concessionout over a period, on the other hand, would increase the cost of&apos; J La *fca* I \ fal&apos;&apos; t
R7U Iadministering the licensing system and create additional anomaliesfor what would probably be a protracted period.   The Governmenthas concluded, therefore, that the concession should be retained.The concessionary licence for the blind will also be retained.Borrowing powers and reserves11.8   The Annan Committee recommended two measures designed tohelp cushion the BBC from the effects of inflation and toobviate the need for frequent increases in the licence fee.   Theyrecommended first that the limits on the BBC&apos;s borrowing powersfor capital and current expenditure should be raised to take accountof inflation [*f2].    The BBC&apos;s Royal Charter enables theCorporation to borrow up to  10 million for temporary bankingaccommodation or facilities and such a sum, not exceeding  20million, as may be approved by the Home Secretary for the purposesof capital expenditure.   The BBC itself is opposed to any increasein its borrowing powers, because it cannot, like commercialundertakings, earn money on the borrowed money; borrowing, therefore,simply means increased interest charges.   However the presentseparate limits in the Royal Charter on temporary bankingaccommodation or facilities and on borrowing for capitalexpenditure seem unnecessarily restrictive and,if they were dis-pensed with, the BBC&apos;s borrowing powers would be more flexibleand there would be no need to increase the overall limit of  30million.    The Government proposes,  therefore, that the  30 millionlimit should not be increased at the present time but that theRoyal Charter should no longer specify separate limits ontemporary banking accommodation or facilities and borrowing forcapital expenditure.    However, the borrowing policies of theCorporation, as a public sector body, will in future be subjectto the Home Secretary&apos;s agreement.11.9   The Committee1s second recommendation, that the BBC shouldbe allowed to build up reserves to obviate the need for frequentincreases in the licence fee C**33i has the full support of theBBC.   However it seems unrealistic to suppose that the BBCv/ill be in a position to build up reserves for some time to come,and in present economic circumstances the Government considersthat it would not be justified in increasing the licence fee to alevel which would enable the Corporation to create a reserve.SECRET
The Government v/ill keep the matter under review in the lightof changes in the national economy.11.10   The Annan Committee considered certain criticisms aboutthe way in which the BBC spends its money, and recommended thatthe information in the BBCs annual report and accounts should bexpanded so that the public could see more clearly how therevenue from the licence fees was spent [MO-   The Governmentconcurs and notes with approval that the Corporation is inagreement with this recommendation.
CHAPTER 12:   MATTERS AFFECTING INDEPENDENT BROADCASTING12.1.   The main conclusions the Government has reached in the lightof the Annan Report about the future responsibilities of the IBAare set out in Chapter 6.   The proposals described in Chapter 7(Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), Chapter 8 (the accountabilityof the broadcasting authorities), Chapter 9 (the Government&apos;sresponsibilities in relation to broadcasting) and Chapter 10 (theresponsibilities of the broadcasting organisations) are alsorelevant to the Authority.   The responsibilities which the IBA willassume for cable services, including pay-TV, and other local servicesare dealt with in Chapter 13.   The Government agrees with theAnnan Committee that the broadcasting services for which the IBAis now responsible should continue to be provided by organisationsunder contract to and under the supervision of, the Authority;    andthat the Authority should retain its reserve powers to commissionprogrammes (against the possibility, for example, of a temporarylack of suitable organisations to hold a contract or of defaultby a programme contractor) The present chapter considers thedetailed questions raised in the Annan Report which relate toindependent television and local radio.COMPOSITION AND INTERESTS OF THE INDEPENDENT TELEVISION ANDINDEPENDENT LOCAL RADIO CONTRACTORS12.2.   The composition and interests of the independent television(ITV) and independent local radio (ILR) contractors are matters ofimportance having regard to the dominant position of broadcastingamong the mass media and to the statutory monopoly enjoyed by thecompanies.   The principal considerations of policy in this contextare the need to ensure that the same people do not control all themedia of communication, particularly in relation to the news;   theneed to ensure that the companies do not make unfair use of theirmonopoly position to advance their other interests;    and the needto consider the effect of broadcasting on the other mass media,particularly the newspaper industry.12.3*   The existing rules relating to the composition and interestsof the ITV and ILR companies may be summarised as follows:
(a)   In relation to press holdings in ITV or ILR companies,the Home Secretary, and the IEA with the agreement of theHome Secretary, have power to terminate or suspend a company&apos;scontract if they consider that the existence of newspapershareholdings has led, or is leading, to a situation whichis contrary to the public interest.(b) The IBA is required to do all it can to secure thattelevision contractors or their associated companies do notacquire controlling interests in local radio contractors inthe same area, and vice versa.(c) Certain individuals and organisations are disqualifiedfrom being IT/ or ILR programme contractors, eg companieswhich are not incorporated under the laws of, or are controlledby persons who are not ordinarily resident in, the UnitedKingdom, the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands.(d) Persons (or companies) who carry on advertising agencybusinesses or have controlling interests in such businessesare also disqualified from being ITV or ILR programmecontractors.In addition, the IBA has certain general powers in relation to thecomposition and interests of the programme companies:   for instanceit may terminate a contract if the company changes its nature orcharacteristics in such a way that, had the changes taken place beforethe contract was made, the Authority would not have entered into it.Press holdings12.4.   The powers described in paragraph 12.3(a) have never had tobe used, though the Independent Television Authority (as the IBAwas known before the Sound Broadcasting Act 1972) required theThompson interests in Scottish Television to be reduced from80 per cent to 55 per cent in 1964 and to 25 per cent in 1968.The present position is that there are press holdings in all butthree ITV companies;    individual press holdings range from less than1 per cent to 37 per cent;    and aggregate press holdings in any onecompany are less than 10 per cent in the case of 8 companies between25 per cent and 45 per cent for 5 companies and 62 per cent in onecompany (Southern Television)...j ... 11 a J* 3
12.5-   The question of press holdings in ITV and ILR companies wasconsidered both by the Annan Committee and by the Royal Commissionon the Press.   Neither found any evidence that press interests hadsought to influence the policy of the companies in which they heldinterests, but both recognised that it was undesirable fornewspapers to have too large a financial interest in broadcasting.The Annan Committee recommended that the present statutory require-ments on press holdings in television companies should be retained,though they regarded it as undesirable for any newspaper to havemore than 10 per cent voting shares in any television company orfor the total press interest in any company to be more than25 per cent [^f*   They also recommended that particular attentionshould be given by the Authority and the Home Secretary to theaggregate holdings of any one press interest in the total broadcast-ing system /3^J*   The Royal Commission on the Press recommended:(a)   that no shareholding by a newspaper company or combinationof companies in a broadcasting company should be allowed toamount to effective control;    and(b)   that the IBA should be mindful of a participant newspapercompany1s regional interests when awarding televisioncontracts, and in particular should strongly discourageholdings by a company which had the dominant part of newspapercirculation in the transmission area of a television company.A minority of the Royal Commission considered that no newspapercompany should be permitted to have holdings in an ITV company inthe circulation area of any of its newspapers.   All the members ofthe Royal Commission were of the opinion that it would be prefera.ble,in order to emphasise the independence of broadcasting and newspapersfrom each other if press interests were not represented on theboards of ITV or ILR companies in which they had shareholdings.12.6.   The Government does not consider that press holdings in ITVor ILR companies are wrong in principle.    It agrees with the AnnanCommittee and the Royal Commission, however, that broadcasting andnewspapers must not be permitted to become&quot;mouthpieces for thesame voice&quot;. Unlike the Annan Committee /5^7 i &apos;t^le Governmentbelieves that the existing lav/ on press holdings is unsatisfactory,primarily because, couched as it is in terms of the &quot;public interest&quot;,it is unnecessarily vague.   One possibility might be to introducespecific statutory limits, expressed in percentage terms, on
individual and aggregate newspaper shareholdings in ITV and ILRcompanies.   Such limits would., however, inevitably be arbitraryand they might not always produce a satisfactory result:    as theRoyal Commission observed, if other holdings are widely dispersed,even an apparently small voting shareholding might give effectivecontrol.   The better course may be to add to the existing law aprovision on the lines suggested in the Royal Commissionsrecommendation at (a) in paragraph 12.5* so that the IBA would berequired to ensure that no individual or aggregate press holdingin an ITV or ILR company amounted to effective control.12.7*   The Government also inclines to the view that a newspapercompany should not normally be represented on the board of an ITVor ILR company in which it has a shareholding.   As a basis forfurther discussion it proposes that joint directorships might beprohibited except where the IBA is of the opinion that there arespecial circumstances which warrant the representation of ashare holding newspaper company on the board of an ITV or ILRcompany.12.8.   As regards aggregate or dominant press holdings (see paragraph12*5) &quot;the Government agrees that the IBA should, when consideringapplications for ITV or ILR franchises, have particular regard tothe extent of individual or aggregate newspaper holdings inindependent television and local radio as a whole.   It believes,however, that the existing powers of the IBA and the Home Secretaryrelating to newspaper holdings, the powers of the IBA as respectschanges in the composition or nature of an ITV or ILR company, andthe additional powers proposed for the IBA in paragraph 12.6 areadequate for the purpose of ensuring that newspapers are notpermitted to obtain too large an interest in independent broadcasting.Television and radio contractors interests in each other12.9*   The Annan Committee recommended that the holdings oftelevision companies in local radio should be very small, and thatthere should be no joint directorships Since the sameconsiderations apply the Government believes that the lav; relatingto ITV companies&apos; shareholdings in ILR companies (and vice versa)and to joint directorships of ITV and ILR companies should be thesame as the law relating to newspaper companies&apos; holdings in ITV orILR companies an 2^ l T^ directorships of newspaper and ITV or
ILR companies.   The IBA will therefore bp required to ensure thatno individual or aggregate holdings &quot;by independent televisioncontractors amounts to effective control of ILR companies (andvice versa).   In addition, joint directorships of ITV and ILRcompanies will not be permitted, unless the IBA considers thatspecial circumstances justify them.Foreign holdings12.10.   The Annan Committee recommended that foreign holdings inITV and ILR companies should be severely limited, but that thestatutory provisions need not be changed/62 and 90/,   The existingstatutory disqualification of foreign companies from being ITV orILR programme contractors has its origin in the fear that ourcultural heritage would be at risk if foreign interests werepermitted to dominate so powerful a medium as broadcasting.   TheGovernment agrees that the restrictions must be retained, subjectto any adjustments which may prove necessary to take account of ourinternational obligations, including our membership of the EEC.Interests in advertising agencies12.11.   The Annan Committee made no recommendations on the questionof the ITV or ILR companies1 interests in advertising agencies.The Government considers that the existing statutory restrictionwhich prevents persons (or companies) who carry on, or havecontrolling interests in, an advertising agency business from beingprogramme contractors should be retained.INDEPENDENT TELEVISION12.12.   The next 12 paragraphs consider questions raised in theAnnan Report which relate specifically to independent television.Programme contracts12.13*   As to the duration of programme contracts the AnnanCommittee recommended that contracts should normally be awarded fora period of seven years /54/ and that proposals for a system ofare claimed for a system of rolling contracts over a system offixed-term contracts are that the former offers greater securityof tenure for a programme contractor and that, by enabling theAuthority to refuse to roll the contract (or to roll it for ashorter period than it would otherwise permit), the Authority hasrolling contracts shouldThe advantages which
1 1greater leverage at more frequent intervals to require a programmecompany to improve the service it is providing.   The disadvantageof a system of rolling contracts is that it is too favourable to theincumbent programme contractor:    if the contractors performance isnot satisfactory   it can be given, and the Authority -will be undergreat pressure to give it, another chance.   Moreover, the systemcould inhibit the Authority from making such changes as itconsidered desirable to the franchise areas.    It may be, however, thatthese disadvantages could be overcome by a system which combinedrolling with fixed-term contracts - ie rolling contracts whichcontain a &quot;break-point&quot; at which the franchise has to be put up forcompetition.   The Government will reach a conclusion on this matterin the light of any comments made on this section of the Yfhite Paper.Diversification12.14*   Concern was expressed to the Annan Committee about the extentto which the ITV companies had used their profits to diversify theirinterests.   The Committee examined this matter, noted thatindependent television had in some instances itself been the resultof diversification, and concluded:It seemed to us that the acid test was whether a company hadretained enough of its profits to provide the capital neededto finance new investment in equipment and programmes at alltimes.   Since most of the companies in converting to colourhad financed this major re-equipment from their own resources,we thought ITV came through this test:    it was not diversifica-tion v/hich had prevented those who had not been able to do so.The Committee went on to say -Vie think that the Authority should be left to decide whetherparticular diversification is desirable since they are bestable to assess whether, v/hen a company applies to diversify,it has adequate liquid assets to meet foreseeable needs.The Government accepts this conclusion and considers that theexisting powers of the 33A are adequate to ensure that independenttelevision is not harmed by diversification.
f-* -fz&quot;i       i u HHB12.15     The Annan Committee also&apos;recommended that theprogramme companies should be required by the terms of theircontract with the Authority to distinguish clearly in theirpublished accounts between their television operations in theUnited Kingdom and their other activities.   The Committeealso considered that it should be a condition of their contractsthat the accounts of the ITV companies for their UnitedKingdom television operations should be produced for a standardfinancial year, common to all the companies and the Authority /J)6jThe Government agrees that the ITV companies should distinguishin their published accounts their television from their otheroperations, but considers that it is sufficient to rely onsection 17 of the Companies Act 19&amp;7 which requires substantiallydifferent sources of turnover to be detailed separately in thedirectors1 report.12.16     The ITV companies already furnish information relatingto income and expenditure as required by the IBA in connectionwith the assessment of the levy and they have agreed to continueto produce a separate series of accounts related to a commonfinancial year.   To require the companies to adopt a commonfinancial year for the accounts they are required to produceunder companies legislation would certainly create practicalproblems for those companies which are part of a conglomerate,and the Government does not consider that any advantage wouldbe gained by requiring them to do so.12.17     In the context of diversification the Annan Committeeconsidered allegations of a music monopoly in ITV.   Theessence of the allegation was that some ITV companies hadused their monopoly position in television to advance theirinterest, or the interests of associated companies, in musicpublishing.   The Committee observed that allegations of thiskind are bound to be made if a programme company has interestswhich impinge on broadcasting.   The Committee concluded thatit would be too drastic to apply to the ITV companies theprohibition in section 12(6)(a) of the IBA Act 1973 onindependent local radio contractors carrying on, or having
a controlling interest in, a music publishing or record manufacturingbusiness.   They recommended instead that provisions similarto those of section 1*4 of the IBA Act 1973 should be extendedto television companies with interests in record or musicpublishing companies to enable the Authority and, if necessary,the Home Secretary to intervene in the public interest [61].As indicated in paragraph 12.6 the Government considers thatsection 1** of the 1973 Act is unnecessarily vague.   Moreover,the IBA has indicated that a provision on the lines ofsection 1&apos;* covering the record or music publishing interestsof the ITV companies would need to contain the criteria bywhich the Authority, or the Home Secretary, would decidewhether such interests had led or were leading to results whichwere contrary to the public interest.12.18     The Annan Committee also considered that the exclusionof companies which had music promotion or employment businesseswould reduce the risks of likely abuse in these areas, andrecommended that section 12(6)(b) and (c) of the IBA Act 1973should be applied in future to television contracts; alsothat the provision relating to promotion business should beamended to cover vision and sound recordings other thanbroadcast programmes [60].   The effect of this recommendationwould be to disqualify a company from being a programmecontractor if it carried on, either through itself or asubsidiary, a business which, to an extent which the IBAconsidered substantial, consisted of promoting the broadcastingof sound recordings, musical works or the performance ofmusical works, or vision or sound recordings other thanbroadcast programmes or of obtaining employment for theatricalperformances or for people to take part in broadcasts.    Theprohibition would also apply to a company which had on itsboard or among its employees persons who would be disqualifiedunder section 12(6)(b) or (c).    In its comments on the AnnanReport the IBA have made the point that promotional activitiesare an integral part of music publishing and record manufacturingbusinesses and also of video cassette and sound recordingbusinesses.
f*) mm flVfc MMBmw 9m\&amp; %\ mm1 %12.19   The recommendations considered in the preceding twoparagraphs raise a more general question.   Are there adequatesafeguards to ensure that the programme contractors (whether fortelevision or local radio) do not abuse the monopoly position whichthese contracts confer on them to further their other interests byunfair means?   The Government considers that the IBA is probablyin the best position to keep these matters (though they go somewhatwider than the Authority&apos;s responsibilities for broadcasting) underreview, and it proposes to discuss with the Authority what (if any)additional powers it should have in this regard.FinanceSpot advertising12.20     The Government accepts the Annan Committee&apos;s recom-mendation that independent television should continue to befinanced by spot advertising and the advertising time shouldcontinue to be sold by the programme companies [*t9].The levy12.21     The Committee   recommended that no immediate changeshould be made in the arrangements for assessing the levy butthat the Government should keep the matter under review [68].Since the Annan Report was published, the Tenth Report of theCommittee of Public Accounts (16) has also been published.This Report contains comments on, among other things, theoperation of the levy (paragraphs ^8-56).   The Governmentaccepts in principle that the levy should be assessed on theprofits of the independent television companies, but is nowreviewing, in consultation with the IBA, the present arrange-ments for assessment and collection.Assistance to ITV companies12.22     In response to a suggestion by the IBA that it shouldbe permitted to give financial assistance to an ITV companyto tide it over a difficult period or to re-equip or moderniseits studios, the Annan Committee concluded that the Authorityshould be given greater discretionary power to subsidiseprogramme companies by way of a loan or in such a way thatsuch payments do not add directly to the company&apos;s assets.% mm /0m^ nt BM0
or become a grant to the shareholders.   The Committeerecommended that a reserve fund should be created by increasedrentals for this purpose, but they also recommended that theIBA should be able to draw on the fund to help companiesfinance ambitious programme projects [67].   The Governmentnotes that the IBA has doubts about the need for a separatereserve fund and in particular about the desirability of afund to finance ambitious programme projects.   The IBA hascommented:The introduction of such a reserve fund v/ould changethe relationship between the Authority and the companies;and it v/ould add credibility to the view that in normalcircumstances the companies should aim to do only profit-making programmes.   In its observation&quot; on the Report ofthe Select Committee on Nationalised Industries, theAuthority wrote that it would not wish to see thecompanies1 own responsibility for innovation lessened;and it v/ould be unfortunate to give the impression thatAuthority requirements about schedule content could onlybe enforced by the provision of grant-aid.   The power oftemporary general subsidy is one thing; grant-aid forspecific programme projects is another.   For these reasonswe do not seek, nor v/ould we welcome, a change inlegislation v/hich would make the adoption of thisrecommendation possible.These are substantial arguments and the Government has concludedthat it should not propose an amendment to the 1973 Act to enablethe IBA to establish a separate reserve fund to help financeambitious programme projects.    As part of the review of theAuthority&apos;s financial basis referred to in paragraph 6.31 theGovernment intends to discuss with the Authority the questionof a discretionary provision v/hich would enable it, subject tothe Home Secretary&apos;s agreement, to provide financial assistanceto an ITV (or independent local radio) company to tide it overa difficult period or for the purpose of modernising orre-equipping studios.Networking on ITV12.23    The Annan Committee recommended that the regionalcompanies jointly should have .one representative on theProgramme Controllers1 Group [653*   The schedules for thetelevision service for which the IBA is responsible are
constructed by the programme companies for their respectiveareas around the programmes which form the network.   Thenetwork itself is controlled by the Network ProgrammeCommittee (NPC) which consists of representatives of theIBA, the chief executives of all the ITV companies and theProgramme Controllers of the five central companies (ie thosecompanies whose contracts require them to produce programmesfor the network).   However, the central core of netv/orkprogrammes is worked out by the Programme Controllers Groupv/hich consists of the Programme Controllers of the five centralcompanies and the IBA&apos;s Director of Television, under thechairmanship of the Director of the NPC&apos;s Planning Secretariat.12.2*t     The Government agrees with the Annan Committee that theregional companies should have a greater voice on the ProgramneControllers Group [^Qr.   At present the regional companies arerepresented on this group through its chairman and the IBA&apos;sDirector of Television.   However, the former is the servantof all the ITV companies and the latter of the Authority,and the Government does not consider this form of representationof the regional companies to be satisfactory.    The Governmentnotes with approval that the IBA has undertaken to discusswith the companies the question of the representation of theregional companies on the Programme Controllers Group, andv/ill consider what (if any) steps it should take in this matterin the light of the outcome of these discussions.INDEPENDENT LOCAL RADIO12.25     The next seven paragraphs consider questions raised in theAnnan Report which relate specifically to independent locd. radio.Certain matters which affect independent local radio are considerednot only in paragraphs 12.2 to 12.11 (composition and interestsof the ITV and ILR contractors) but also in paragraphs 12. 12to 12.2*t (independent television), particularly paragraphs 12.13(programme contracts), 12.19 (monopolies) and 12.22 (assistanceto ITV companies).
12.26     The Annan Committee recommended that the local radioservices should be provided by organisations under fixed termcontracts of seven years initially and five years thereafter[753-    From the outset independent local radio franchises havebeen awarded on the basis of three-year rolling contracts.Paragraph 12.13 indicates that the Government will reach aconclusion on the question of the duration of ITV contracts onthe basis of comments received on the options which are available(ie rolling contracts, fired-term contracts or some combinationof the two).   These options are also available in relation toindependent local radio and the Government will similarly reacha conclusion as to which should be adopted in the light of anycomments v/hich may be received on this part of the White Paper.Music publishing, record manufacturing, etc12.27     Section 12(3)(a) and (6) of the IBA Act 1973 disqualifiesa company from holding an ILR contract if it carries on (eitheritself or through a subsidiary) a business v/hich, to an extentv/hich the IBA considers substantial, consists of music publishingrecord manufacturing, promoting the broadcasting of soundrecordings, providing the broadcasting or performance of musicalworks, or obtaining employment for theatrical performers or forpeople to take part as performers in broadcast programmes.The Annan Committee did not recommend any change in thisdisqualification in relation to ILR companies, and the Governmentproposes to retain the disqualification.Local newspapers12.28     Section 18 of the IBA Act 1973 requires that theproprietor of a newspaper v/hich circulates wholly or mainly,and has a substantial circulation, in an area to be served byan ILR station, or whose financial position would be materiallyand adversely affected by the station, should be offered ashareholding in a local radio company.    Section 18(6), however,
provides that a newspaper shareholding may only be such as theIBA considers appropriate having regard to the likely adversefinancial effect which the local radio station is likely tohave on the newspaper, and that, in the case of a newspaperv/hich is the only local newspaper, or the only local newspaperwith a substantial circulation, in the area, must not be such asto enable the proprietor to gain control over the local radiocompany.   The Annan Committee recommended that local newspapersshould no longer have a prescriptive right to be offered ashareholding in a local radio station, though they noted thatthe Authority might think it desirable for local newspapersto have a modest shareholding in a station [88].   The RoyalCommission on the Press were of the same opinion.   TheGovernment also concurs, and its forthcoming broadcasting legislatio.will contain proposals for the repeal of section 18 of the 1973Act.   The safeguard in section 18(6) will be subsumed in theprovision proposed in paragraph 12.6.12.29     The Royal Commission on the Press recommended thatnewspaper companies should not be permitted to have holdingsin local radio stations in the circulation area of any of theirprovincial newspapers.    The Government is not at present mindedto accept this recommendation.   It considers that, for thereasons given in paragraph 12.6, it will be sufficient torequire the IBA to ensure that no individual or aggregatepress holdings in an ILR company amount to effective control.Ownership of ILR companies12.30     The Annan Committee recommended that greater diversityshould be encouraged in the kinds of organisation to which the IBAawards franchises and at least some of the stations should be runby non-profit-making trusts based in the localities [75]*   TheCommittee recognised however that the Authority&apos;s mainresponsibility would be to award the franchise in each area tothe organisation which seemed most likely to provide the kindof service best suited to what the people in the area said theyneeded.    The allocation of independent local radio contractswill continue to be a matter for the IBA, in accordance with the
Authority&apos;s duties under the legislation.    However   asindicated in paragraph 4.13, it will be open to the IBA toexperiment with the Annan Committee&apos;s suggestion that non-profit-making trusts should be awarded franchises.12.31     The Committee also recommended that the Authority(and the legislation) should ensure that stations arepredominantly owned by those living and working in thelocality [87] .   The Government agrees that the aim must beto secure that so far as possible ILR stations are locallyowned and this will be reflected in the forthcoming legislation.There may be circumstances, however, in which no applicationfrom a locally owned company is forthcoming or in v/hich, ifsuch an application is made, it is, in the Authority1s view,less satisfactory than another application (eg as regards thekind of service proposed or the financial viability of theproposal).    The legislation will not therefore prevent theIBA from awarding a franchise to the applicant which itconsiders will provide the best service for the locality.12.32     The Government&apos;s proposals concerning the financialaspects of independent local radio are set out in Chapter *f.Networking on ILR12.33     The Annan Committee recommended that there should be nonational networking of programmes except for an event of nationalimportance, but that a limited amount of networking betweenstations in a region should be permitted [80].   The Governmentnotes with approval the IBA&apos;s comment on this recommendation:V/e do not envisage ILR acquiring a networkcharacter in the way that ITV has done.   V/e agreethat there should only be a limited amount of sharedor networked material.........and that much of thiscan be organised regionally or nationally.   But we domaintain that local radio should be required to financea national news service; national and internationalnews, in our view, form essential ingredients in thelocally relevant programme mix.
P 000ADVERTISING ON ITV AND ILR12.3**     Independent broadcasting is also subject to certainrequirements relating to advertising.   The Government agreeswith the Annan Committee&apos;s recommendation that the presentstatutory requirements on broadcast advertising on bothindependent television and independent local radio should beretained [50, 79].12.35     The Government appreciates the concern which led amajority of the Committee to recommend that there should beno advertisements v/ithin children&apos;s programmes or between twoprogrammes for children; and that the Authority should ensurethat advertisements promoting products or servies of particularinterest to children are not shown before 9 pra [51]-    It is notpersuaded, however, that such a restriction, which would be boundto be arbitrary, is necessary.   Section 9 of the IBA Act 1973requires the Authority to draw up, and, from time to time review,and secure compliance with, a code governing standards andpractice in advertising; the section also gives the Authoritywide powers to impose such other requirements relating toadvertising which go beyond those of the code as it considersnecessary, and, in addition, to give directions as regards thetime at which advertisements may be broadcast.   The Governmentbelieves that these powers are adequate.    It notes with approvalthat the IBA has accepted that all children&apos;s programmesof half an hour should be free of advertising breaks, and thatthe IBA is considering further, in consultation with itsAdvertising Advisory Committe, whether there are other changesto existing rules which could usefully be made in the interestsof children.
CHAPTER 13: CABLE, TELETEXT AND OTHER SERVICESCable etc13*1   Cable relay systems play an important role in enablingpeople to receive the services provided by the BBC and the IBA.Some 1*t per cent of households with television sets now usecable systems: some provided by landlords, housing associationsand local authorities for blocks of flats; others by smalltelevision clubs; the majority of subscribers, however, usesystems provided by commercial operators.   All the cableoperators require licences from the Home Office and, exceptwhere the Post Office provides the network, from the PostOffice.   With the exception of the operators of the     -communitycable television and the radio experiments, cableoperators are not permitted to intiate their own programmes.As the areas in which the services of the BBC and the IBAcannot be received (or received satisfactorily) off-airget smaller, the question arises as to what role cable, inparticular the commercial cable operators, should in futureplay in the broadcasting system as a whole.The future of technological terms13.2   The capacity of most existing cable systems in theUnited Kingdom is between six and nine television channels,but systems with capacities of up to 2k to 30 televisionchannels exist in other countries and recent technologicaldevelopments could produce systems with much greatercapacities.   The technological question for the future iswhether this country should aim to have a nationwidewideband cable system capable of meeting all our communicationsneeds.   The decisions taken today must not prejudice possiblefuture developments.   The Post Office Review Committee (Cmnd 6850)recommended, and the Government accepts, that the optionfor a nationwide wideband cable system for telecommunicationsas a whole must be kept open -and that the Post Office shouldsafeguard it in technical terms by insisting that allfuture developments of wideband cable television should use
technology v/hich will be compatible with such a system.The future in terms of services13-3   With the gradual reduction in the number and sizeof the areas in which BBC and IBA services cannot bereceived off-air, the commercial viability of commercialcable relay operations v/ill depend on the operators beingpermitted to provide additional services.   The AnnanCommittee observed -On cable services there is a simple strategic choiceto be made.   Should it develop primarily as a Pay TVor Subscription television service, as it has in theUnited States and Canada, providing relays of broadcastservices, feature films and live sporting events witha channel available for a local service?   Or should itdevelop primarily as a community resource, a centrewhich local people can use to make their own programmes?The Committee concluded that cable television should be developedprimarily as a local or community service [83 and 164], andthat cable operators should not be authorised to provide servicesof pay-television  106].   The Government does not accept thatthe choice is quite so stark: in principle there seems to beno reason why both pay-television and community cable servicesshould not develop side by side.   It is necessary, therefore,to consider separately the future of community cable servicesand whether pay-television should be permitted.Cable as a community resource13*4   There have been six community cable television experiments;and five community cable radio experiments have been authorised.Community cable television has not progressed: three of theexperiments have closed down and only three remain - Sv/indonViewpoint, Channel ^O at Milton Keynes and Greenwich Cablevision.It is still to early to be sure whether there is sufficientdemand for services of this kind to enable them to becomeself-financing, though the present indications are notgenerally encouraging.   Nevertheless, the Government welcomesthe initiatives which have been taken in this field and hopes
that financially viable community cable services can bedeveloped.   The Government is strongly of the opinion,however, that these services must satisfy the test of whetherthe communities in which they operate are prepared to payfor them.Pry-TV13.5   The main arguments in favour of pay-TV are that itcould increase the range and quality of programmes availableand provide finance for new programme material and that thepublic should be afforded the opportunity of buying whatpay-TV can offer.   The central question, however, is whetherthere would be a net improvement in, and widening of therange of, television services as a whole.   Against pay-TVit is argued that it would syphon off good programmes - films,sporting events, etc - from the existing off-air servicesand lead to their impoverishment: those who could afford,and were able to receive, pay-TV would therefore benefit inthe sense that the totality of services available to themwould not be reduced or worsened, while for those who couldnot there would be a reduction in the range and quality ofprogrammes available.    It is clear, moreover, that pay-TVcould have damaging effects on cinemas.13.6   The Government is not prepared at this stage to dismissthe possible advantages of pay-TV, or to conclude that thedisadvantages which it might hold could not be overcome.Whether the disadvantages can be overcome is a question towhich experimentation might hold the answer.   Provision willtherefore be made in the new legislation to enable pilotschemes of pay-TV to be authorised subject to careful regulationto guard against the possibly damaging effects v/hich pay-TV mighthave on television as a whole, and on the cinema industry.   Thesesafeguards will need to include restrictions on the making ofexclusive arrangements for the transmission of sporting events andother events of national significance, and some guarantee that newfeature films will be shown first in cinemas.
13-7   Apart from the possibility that regulated pay-TVmight increase the range and quality of television in thiscountry, it might also have the advantage of generating, inthe longer term, funds which could be used to finance theproduction of films.   This point has been put to theGovernment by the Interim Action Committee on the FilmIndustry, who have recommended that pilot schemes of pay-TVshould, subject to conditions, be permitted.   It is alsopossible that pay-TV might generate funds which could beused to finance the development of community cable televisionservices.   These are possibilities which can be explored inthe context of pay-TV pilot schemes.Television for public shov/ing13-8   The Annan Committee recommended that there should be noincrease in television for public showing [106].   The Governmentaccepts that these services must not be permitted to impoverishthe output of the general broadcasting services, and considersthat, as now, each application for permission to providetelevision for public showing should be dealt with on itsmerits.Responsibility for cable systems etc13.9   At present the Home Office is responsible for licensingcable operations and for ensuring that the terms of the licencesare observed.   In the case of the community cable televisionexperiments, this has meant that the Home Office has becomeinvolved in detailed programming questions.   This is whollyat variance v/ith the constitutional arrangements which havetraditionally governed broadcasting in this country, wherebythe responsibility for, and control over, programmes is vestedin independent, publicly accountable broadcasting authorities.The Government intends therefore to place the responsibilityfor supervising cable services with the Independent BroadcastingAuthority, and to apply to these services broadly the rulesand requirements which govern independent broadcasting.The Home Office will however retain its powers and responsibilitie
in relation to the technical aspects of cable servicesand the powers and responsibilities of the Post Office will not beaffected.13-10   The proposals set out in the preceding paragraph willalso apply to the other services for which the Home Office ispresently responsible, such as hospital broadcasting services,university radio stations, educational cable services, andtelevision for public showing.Teletext13-11   The Annan Committee recommended that the BBC and the IBAshould be authorised to provide broadcast teletext informationservices as an extension of their existing services, and thatnewspapers should not be given the right to participate withthe broadcasting organisations in the development of theseservices [1053-   The Committee saw an important future forteletext, but their recommendation that the services should bereviewed in due course by their proposed Public Enquiry Boardfor Broadcasting reflected their concern that the effect of theteletext services both on the broadcasting authorities and on thePost Office were difficult to foresee and could be far-reaching,particularly as regards the Press and possibly independentbroadcasting.   Moreover, a minority of the Committee consideredthat, while the BBC and the IBA should continue to operatetheir teletext services, the editorial policy of each shouldbe determined by boards on which both the broadcasters andjournalists would be represented.13-12   The Royal Commission on the Press also saw an importantfuture for all three teletext servies, but they too recognisedthat its development raised difficult issues.   They consideredthat, although the BBCs and the IBA&apos;s services (CEEFAX andOracle respectively) would offer some editorial and commercialcompetition to newspapers, the greater capacity of the PostOffice*s Prestel viewdata service was in the long run likelyto offer more serious competition.   Both the Annan Committeeand the Royal Commission considered and rejected suggestionsthat newspapers should have a preferential right to participatein the development of teletext.
13-13       The Government has already announced that thequestion surrounding the future of teletext is not whetherteletext has a future but what is the appropriate institutionaland supervisory framework within which broadcast teletextshould develop.   But as it develops, teletext could have aprofound effect on broadcasting and on the press.    Itspotential is very considerable.   Teletext is a technologyin which this country has a world lead and it is importantthat this position should be exploited to the full.   Whatmatters in practical terms is that the decoding equipmentwhich enables teletext to be received on television setsshould be developed as soon as possible at a price v/hich willput this equipment within the reach of the public at large.13-1^   It is not clear at this stage v/hat institutional andsupervisory arrangements will be appropriate for broadcastteletext.   Indeed, it may be that the present arrangementsare satisfactory.   However, these are questions which requirefurther careful consideration, and the Government intends,therefore, to enter into discussions with the broadcastingauthorities - including the OBA - and other organisationswhich have an interest in the future of broadcast teletext.It will reach a conclusion on the question in the light ofthese discussions and, if necessary, include proposals for theinstitutional and supervisory framework for broadcast teletextin its forthcoming broadcasting legislation.13.15   The broadcast teletext services already provide theoptional facilities (given that viewers&apos; television sets havethe necessary decoding equipment) for superimposing informationon the television screen.   These services, coupled v/ithPalantype and computer facilities, could in due course offerthe prospect of an instant and verbatim display of informationduring live television broadcasts, which should be ofsignificant benefit to those whose hearing is impaired.   TheGovernment pays tribute to the research and development workwhich has been, and is continuing to be, conducted in thisfield by all concerned.
Broadca;&quot; traffic information service13-16   Tr.e Annan Committee recommended that a new broadcasttraffic information service should be established, but onlyat such a time as the road traffic authorities and the Govern-ment considered they v/ere able to provide and finance it [108].A Working Party under the chairmanship of the Department ofTransport has recommended that further experimentation beundertaken in this field.
CHAPTER lk   OTHER TECHNICAL MATTERSl*f.l   This chapter considers the Annan Committee&apos;srecommendations concerning technical matters.Radio1^.2   The Committee recommended that the Government shouldauthorise the BBC to re-organise the LF and MF transmissions oftheir national radio services in such a way as to improve thecoverage of those services which are most used [1^9]-The Government has accepted the BBC&apos;s plans for redeployingthe long and medium frequencies used for the Corporationsdomestic network services.   Moreover, effect is being givento the Committee&apos;s recommendation that the BBC&apos;s programme forextending the coverage of their VHF radio services in Scotlandand Wales should be carried out as a matter of urgency [150]:the BBC has made proposals, which have been approved inprinciple by the Government, for further VHF transmitters inScotland and V/ales.1^.3   Additional VHF radio channels could become available ina few years time in the Band 97*6 - 100 MHz.   The AnnanCommittee envisaged that these channels would be used for anadditional national radio service supervised by the OBA [10*f].The Government considers however that it is as yet too early toreach a decision on this question.   Moreover, account will needto be taken of the outcome of the 1979 World AdministrativeRadio Conference (see paragraph 9*3)*TelevisionThe Annan Committee recommended that the completion of theprogramme to provide UHF television services to populations ofmore than 500 people should be regarded as the highest priorityin the development of broadcasting services [151]-   TheGovernment authorised the BBC and the IBA to proceed with thisstage of the UHF extension programme at the end of 1976, andthe broadcasting authorities are now pressing ahead with theprovision of the 250 or so relay stations which will be required.Priority has been given to the completion of the first phase ofthe programme, ie to provide services to populations of more than1,000 people.
14*5*   The Annan Committee recommended that in the extension ofUHP coverage, priority to the extent possible should be given toKid-Hales and to Northern Scotland and the Islands, as recommendedby the Committee on Broadcasting Coverage chaired bySir Stewart Crawford /l52/r.   This recommendation is in line withthe Government&apos;s main concern that UHP coverage should be extendedto the whole country as soon as possible.14*6     Another of the Crawford Committee&apos;s recommendations endorsedby the Annan Committee was that consideration should be given tomaking available for television a four channel group of frequenciesin Band V above 854 megahertz /l527*   The availability of thesefrequencies for broadcasting is being considered in the context ofthe World Administrative Radio Conference in 1979*1^.7   Assuming that the current rate of progress is maintained,the broadcasting authorities expect that the provision of UHFtelevision services for communities of more than 500 v/ill belargely completed by around the end of 1982.   With this in mind,the Annan Committee recommended that provided there is no delayin extending the coverage of the UHF television services, allVHF ^05-line television transmissions should cease by 1982; andthat consideration should be given to closing down thetransmitters in a phased pattern [15*0*    The Government wishesto give further consideration, in consultation with thebroadcasting authorities, to the question of the timetable, butit recognises the advantages of a phased programme of closureswith reasonable notice being given.1^.8   The cessation of VHF ^05-line transmissions will leaveBands I and III available for alternative use.   The AnnanCommittee recommended that a fifth television service should beprovided in due course on an area basis, using frequencies inBand I and Band IU [107].    The international frequency allocationtable is to be revised at a World Administrative RadioConference in 1979* and in the course of canvassing viewson what changes the United Kingdom should advocate or supportat this Conference, representations have been received that someor all of the frequencies in Bands I and III should be allocated
to types of radio services other than broadcasting.   TheGovernment considers that it is too early to reach a conclusionon this matter.1^.9     The Government shares the concern of the Annan Committee forcommunities of less than 500 people in remote areas who will continueto remain beyond the coverage of the UHF television transmitternetwork.     The Annan Committee recommended that their proposed LocalBroadcasting Authority should advise communities of less than 500people in remote areas on the possible ways of receivingtelevision services and that consultative machinery bringingtogether the Local Broadcasting Authority, the Cable TelevisionAssociation, the Post Office and representatives of localgovernment or other authorities should be established on thelines proposed by the Crawford Committee for the BBC and IBA[156].   The Government does not consider that the establishmentof the consultative machinery recommended by the Committee wouldbe the best way of proceeding.   Instead, it agrees with the BBCand the IBA that this task should continue to be undertaken bythem.   The broadcasting authorities have a general responsibilityfor ensuring that their services are provided to as much of thecountry as is reasonably practicable, and they possess theresources and the technical expertise v/hich is necessary toprovide advice to the smaller communities.   The Government doesnot, however, rule out the use of cable in some such remote areas.Screening1^.10   The Annan Committee recommended that v/here viev/ers aredeprived of a good off-air signal by new buildings or otherstructures the planning authority should ensure that thedevelopers meet the capital cost of providing an alternative meansof reception [155J.     The Government understands the reasoningbehind this recommendation, but does not believe that it would beright, or even practicable, to deal with the matter in the waysuggested.
Sale and manufacture of equipment by the IBAl*t.ll   Section 3(*0 of the Independent Broadcasting AuthorityAct 1973 prevents the Authority from carrying on business assellers of, or, except with the Home Secretary1s approval,themselves engaging in the manufacture of sale of, apparatusfor wireless telegraphy or any other telegraphic equipment.   TheAnnan Committee recommended that there should he no changes in theIBA&apos;s powers to make or sell equipment   [157] buthoped that the Home Secretary would consider favourably anyreasonable requests by the IBA to be permitted to do so.   TheGovernment accepts the Committee&apos;s recommendation, and the HomeSecretary is willing to consider    any reasonable requestSale of unsuitable radio equipment14.13   The Annan Committee recommended that the legislationprohibiting the unauthorised installation and use of wirelesstelegraphy equipment should be tightened up in order to preventthe sale of equipment designed to operate on frequencies whichcould not be authorised in this country and which were likely tocause interference [159]-   This recommendation will beconsidered in the context of the examination of the WirelessTelegraphy Acts, referred to in paragraph  9-13    above.by the Authority.Simultaneous language broadcasts14.12   The Annan Committee recommended that experiments should becarried out in the use of stereo sound techniques for televisionas a means of broadcasting in two languages simultaneously [158].This is primarily a matter for the broadcasting authorities.However, the Government notes with approval that the BBC and IBAare willing to conduct experiments v/hich might lead to thedevelopment of a reasonably practicable method of broadcastinga sound track in two languages simultaneously.
S5Allocation of Band 100 - 108 KHz for broadcasting1^.1**   The Annan Committee recommended that consideration shouldbe given to the possibility of allocating frequencies in the Band100 - 108 MHz to broadcasting in any new long term plan [160].The Government v/ill take this recommendation into account in itspreparations for the 1979 World Administrative Radio Conference.Satellite broadcasting1.^-15   The Annan Committee recommended that the BBC should beresponsible for the transmission of satellite broadcastingservices; and that if any discussions on satellite services takeplace between national broadcasting organisations, the BBC shouldrepresent the interests of the United Kingdom [l6l].The Government appreciates the considerations which led theCommittee to make this recommendation and has noted the views ofthe BBC and the IBA on it.    The Government considers, however,that it would be premature to reach any firm conclusions on theallocation of responsibility for satellite transmissions, thoughit would not wish the IBA to be excluded from any internationaldiscussions on this matter.Video recordinglk.l6   The Annan Committee recommended that the development ofvideo recording equipment should not be restrained but that theTelecommunications Advisory Committee should keep under review thetechnical aspects of the development of video recording and itslikely impact on broadcasting services  162]*       The Governmentagrees in principle with this recommendation and in particularv/ith the need to keep under review the likely impact of videorecording on broadcasting services.   This is a subject which mightusefully be referred to the Broadcasting Technical AdvisoryCommittee proposed in paragraph 9.6      It will be. necessary totake into account possible changes which may result from therecommendations of the Whitford Committee on the Law of Copyrightand Designs, which have an important bearing on the futuredevelopment of video recording.     The Government&apos;s response tothose recommendations is currently in preparation .
lA.17   The Annan Committee also recommended that broadcastingorganisations who enter into the video market or who sellprogramme material for video distribution should show the incomefrom such sales separately in their annual accounts [163].This recommendation and their recommendation concerningthe profits accruing from the sale of programme journals[17*0 stem from similar considerations, and the Governmentaccepts the former as it has accepted the latter (seeparagraph 10.28).

ANNEXFINANCIAL AND MANPOWER IMPLICATIONS OF THE PROPOSALS IN THE DRAFTWHITE PAPER ON BROADCASTIN31.       All the estimates in this Annex are necessarily tentativeuntil detailed discussions can take place with the existing and proposedbroadcasting organisations.     All costs are at current prices.The fourth channel - chapter 32.      Engineering costs are estimated at  28 million over 9 years.Some of these might fall on public funds as Government loans.     Theannual cost of running the service is estimated at  **5 million.     Governmentgrant will be needed to launch the channel and, on a continuing basis, forcertain special (eg educational) programmes.      The level of general assistanceas the channel develops will depend on the amount of advertising revenueattracted.     Government assistance is expected to reduce as the channel becomesestablished.     There may be some adverse effect initially on the levypaid by the independent television companies.     The date of the startof the service will obviously affect the timing and flow of publicexpenditure on the channel.3.     The OBA will need a staff who will not be civil servants;   it will besmaller than the IBA.Fourth channel in Wales - chapter 7(a) Welsh language serviceh.       The BBC&apos;s share of the estimated cost of the additional programmes -some  1.5 million capital and  1.4 million a year revenue - will be takeninto account in future reviews of the level of the television licence fee.The estimated cost of the 03A are  1 million capital and  2.5 million ayear revenue.   About 2^0 additional staff will be needed by the broadcastingauthorities:    they v/ill not be civil servants.(b) Additional children1s programmes in the Welsh language5.       It is hoped that the broadcasting authorities will bear the estimatedcost -  1 million capital and  2 million a year revenue - of these additionalprogrammes.     This will need to be discussed with the broadcasting authoritiesand the position will have to be reviewed if they are unwilling to do so.
(c) V/elsh Language Television Council6.       The Council will be drawn from, and paid by, the broadcasting organisa-tions.   They will need a very small staff (who will not be civil servants)and the costs will be shared by the broadcasting organisations.Local radio - chapter *f7.       The expansion of BBC and independent local radio will not involveany public expenditure:   the licence fee will not be increased for thispurpose and independent local radio will be self-financing.   A levyto be applied on the excess profits of the independent local radio companieswill, in due course, produce additional Government revenue.The B3C - chapter 5,8.      Changes in BBC organisation and the proposed public hearings(chapter 8) will not increase the numbers employed by the BBC or addsignificantly to its costs.     These estimated costs together with theBBCs share of the estimated cost of the Welsh language service and theV/elsh Language Television Council (chapter 7) and the ComplaintsCommission (chapter 8) can be funded by less than  1 on either themonochrome or the colour television licence fees.The IBA - chapter 69.      The IBA will need additional staff to deal with the expansionof independent local radio, the proposed public hearings (chapter 8)and their new functions regarding cable television etc (chapter 13);they will not be civil servants.   The cost will be borne by the independentbroadcasting   system though this will have some adverse effect onthe levy.Public hearings - chapter 810.     The estimated cost of some  0.1 million will be borraby thebroadcasting authorities.The Broadcasting Complaints Commission - chapter 811-.     The estimated annual cost of between  0.1 and  0.2 million a yearwill be shared by the broadcasting organisations.   The very small staff willnot be civil servants.PZ-SC implications12.     So far as public expenditure is concerned an indication has been madein the Survey Report that by 1982-83 the effect on public expenditure maypossibly build up to as much as fc^O million a year.     The Home OfficeSEcr r
otCKfcTconsider that there is no possibility of finding offsetting savings inother areas of their expenditure.     The Treasury point out that in 1931-32and 1932-331 within the 2 per cent growth path for public expenditure agreedby Cabinet, there is some limited room for additions to programmes.   But tothe extent that the cost of these proposals represent a net addition to theHome Office programme, this will pre-empt the resources that would otherwisebe available for additions to other programmes.Effects on Central Government13*     The responsibilities for dealing, within Government, with thefourth channel service and the expansion of local radio, and for servicingthe proposed Working Party on Local Radio (chapter h) and the BroadcastingTechnical Advisory Committee (chapter 9) will involve additional work forthe Home Office.   But there will be a reduction in present Home Office workon cable television etc assigned to the IBA (chapter 13).     Overall there willbe no net increase in Home Office staff.   The proposals for the fourthchannel in Wales will involve additional work for both the Home Office andthe Welsh Office but will not increase staff.
