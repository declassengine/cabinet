DoCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCP(78) 74 COPY NO10 July 1978CABINETREVIEW OF THE POST OFFICEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Industry1. The Report of the Post Office Review Committee (Cmnd 6850),chaired by Professor (now Sir) Charles Carter, was published in July 1977.I have prepared the attached White Paper in response to the Report, takingaccount of the comments of interested parties and of developments in thePost Office over the last year.    The Paper has been discussed and amendedby the Ministerial Committee on Economic and Industrial Policy and I hopeCabinet will be able to agree to it in correspondence without furtherdiscussion.    I should like to publish the White Paper before the Post OfficeReport and Accounts are issued on 24 July and to announce its publication tothe House in a written Parliamentary Question supplemented with a Pressconfer ence.2. The White Paper is in two parts:  the first is the Government1 sresponse to the Report;  the second is a substantial Annex, prepared by thePost Office, which sets out their policies and proposals.MAIN THEME OF THE WHITE PAPER3. The main recommendations in the Review Committee1 s Report wereconcerned with ways of improving the Post Office1 s efficiency and service tocustomers through organisational change, greater productivity and moreeffective monitoring arrangements.    The White Paper puts the accent onthe last two rather than on organisational changes.ORGANISATION4. The Review Committee recommended that the Post Office should besplit into separate public corporations for its main businesses - Posts andTelecommunications.    The Post Office and the Post Office EngineeringUnion favour this course but the other main union the Union of Post OfficeWorkers is strongly opposed to it.    There may be a good case for aneventual split but preparing the necessary legislation would take several years1
and tend to divert attention from the more immediate need to improve thePost Office1 s performance.    The White Paper (paragraphs 13 to 16)therefore acknowledges the arguments for splitting the Post Office but saysthat such a far-reaching decision should not be taken until the Governmenthas had a chance to assess the results of the two-year experiment inindustrial democracy and of the new Chairman&apos;s attempts to decentralisedecision-making through devolution of managerial responsibility.5. The White Paper rejects the Review Committee&apos;s proposal for anAdvisory Council on Posts and Telecommunication Affairs.    This wouldblur responsibilities and delay decisions in much the same way as the PolicyCouncil recommended by the National Economic Development Office for allthe nationalised industries.EFFICIENCY AND SERVICE6. The White Paper emphasises efficiency and service and in particularsets out (in paragraphs 37 and 46) challenging five-year performanceobjectives agreed with the Post Office for Telecommunications and Poctoto supplement their financial targets.    It acknowledges that there is roomfor improvement in public accountability and monitoring arrangements anddiscusses in paragraphs 21 to 29 the means by which this can be achieved.The White Paper also emphasises the important role of the Post Office Users&apos;National Council (POUNC) and lists in paragraph 28 the Governmenfsproposals for strengthening POUNC.7. The White Paper takes the opportunity to reassert the Post Officemonopolies which have recently been challenged by the Opposition and itstresses the importance which the Government attaches to the Post Officeexperiment in industrial democracy.CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION8. With its emphasis on improving efficiency and service to thecustomer, I think the White Paper and the Post Office1 s own statement inthe Annex have a positive story to tell on the issues of direct concern to theconsumer.    Subject to any further views of colleagues, I propose to publishit before the Recess and preferably on 19 July.    I suggest that it can becleared without further discussion and would be glad if any comments couldreach me by end of play on Thureday 13 July.E G VDepartment of Industry10 July 19782
draft white papks : the post officeintroductionEfficient communications are essential to the modem economy,toenable industry, trade and all the public services to performEffectively, and to promote social contacts within the communityand with other countries.   Britain led the world in the development0f postal services, and we now need to keep the mails viable anjcompetitive in the face of increasing inroads from other methods ofCommunication.   Meanwhile, the telephone and telecommunicationsservices are entering a period of rapid and far-reaching technicalchange which can bring important benefits to the community.    Thecountry needs the new communications technologies, and needs them*o be implemented and operated with the greatest possible efficiencyar*d at the lowest possible costs.    These are the challenges facingthe Post Office, and with which this White Paper is concerned.The Post Office ceased to be a Government department and becamea Public corporation on 1 October 1969.    It consists of three Busi-includes the Post Officenesses - Posts, Telecommunications (which now       data   processingservices) and Giro.   Britain has the third largest telephone system^ the world and its comprehensive postal service compares favourablyVith most other countries.    The Post Office employs over 400,000^eople throughout the country, one in sixty of the nationfs labour10rce, and their experience, dedication and long-standing traditions4*0^ Public service are a major national asset.   The Post Office&apos;s newinvestment in 1973/79 is expected to total some  1,000m,^Presenting about 8 per cent of new industrial fixed investment in&quot;bis country, and it has a net book value of fixed assets of over^tOOOra.    By any standards &quot;^fs?^fel%t^ice is a massive and complex
enterprise - one of the biggest businesses in Western Europe.3.     The Post Officefs services impinge on many aspects of dailylife and are based on and protected by statutory monopolies forthe provision of telecommunications and the letter post.    It istherefore natural that the activities of the Post Office are expos^to considerable public scrutiny.   The performance of the Post 0f*icis of day-to-day interest to everyone.4.     In 1975 there was wide public concern about heavy increasesin charges for postal and telecommunications services, and aboutreductions in postal services.   These measures had been taken torestore the Post Office to profitability following the period ofstatutory price restraint during which large deficits had accumulaIn response to this public concern and to the recommendations   0^the Post Office Users1 National Council, the Government invitedindependent Committee under Professor (now Sir) Charles Carter toreview the performance of the Post Office and its use of resourcesand assets.   The Committee^ careful and thorough report, publisnein July 1977 (Cmnd 6850), made many recommendations for future acby the Government and by the Post Office itself.5.

A new Chairman was appointed*ast November and the whole board was reconstituted at the beginning0  this year.   Against this background the Government has taken theopportunity to review a wide range of issues with the Post Officehas given full consideration to the Report of the Post OfficeReview Committee in the light of all the comments made by interestedParties.6.     This Yftiite Paper sets out the Government1 s conclusions arid alsocontains in the Annex a full statement by the Post Office itself.    Inthe body of the White Paper the Government explains its generalapproach to the aims and challenges facing the Post Office (section II)*ts views on the iuture organisation of the P0st Office (section III);its proposals for clarifying the respective responsibilities ofthe Government and the Corporation and for strengthening the arrange-^nts for monitoring the Post Office1s*performance (section IV).Actions V and VI examine the important issues of industrialdemocracy and customer relations and sections VII to X the mainChallenges facing the Businesses.   The Annex sets out the Post Office&apos;0wn policies and its proposals on operational matters in the light ofthe Review Committeefs recommendations.
II THE GOVERlfrSENT1S APPROACH7.     The Post Office is charged under the Post Office Act 1969 v;ithTt isproviding letter and telephone services, inland and overseas.required &quot;so to exercise its powers as to meet the social, indusand commercial needs&quot; of this country; and to provide such lettertelephone services &quot;as satisfy all reasonable demands for then.&quot;These services are founded on the monopoly of the carriage of lc-&quot;&quot;that dates back to the inception of the Royal Mail, and on the P0in telecommunications that derives from the Telegraph Act of 1869*The Select Committee on Nationalised Industries in its Report *non the Post Office!s Letter   Post Services endorsed the continueflicprotection of the Post Office \s monopoly of the letter services-Review Committee was not asked to examine these statutory mono^but it is necessary to put them beyond doubt so that future scr^&apos; ucan be planned effectively in the interests ofbusinessgenerally.private users^ The Government accordingly reaffirms that theseservices v/ill remain statutory monopolies in public ownership&apos;8.     The Government also reaffirms its view that each of the ?0t^Office Businesses must pay its v/ay and earn a reasonable returnassets employed.    This objective has now been achieved: all thiendBusinesses of the Post Office are restored to profitability aumeeting their financial targets agreed with the Government.It &amp;taken the Post Office time however to recover from the setbadfrom the price restraint policies of 1972/7&apos;* and the measuresnot painless.    For the future, it is essential that there sho^clear understanding of the central role of financial targets.RESTRICTED
9.     Financial stablity and profitability are not, however, the onlytest of Post Office performance.   Yfliile recognising the importanceQf financial targets, the Review   &quot;Committee was &quot;convinced that inany publicly-owned undertaking, but especially one such as the PostOffice where a very high proportion of the activities are covered bystatutory monopolies, the one aim which above all others must permeatethe entire organisation is the minimisation of costs for a definedlevel, of service, rather than the maximisation of profits.&quot;   They notethat where prices of services are not determined by competitivePressure, profitability can be achieved by price increases rather thanby improving business efficiency.   The Committee concluded that &quot;theinterests of the customer are best served by giving absolute andcontinuing priority to keeping costs under the tightest possiblecontrol&quot;, and v/ent on to recommend ways in which the monitoring ofeconomic efficiency and service to customers could be improved.^0.   The Government agrees with the Review Committee that the PostOffice mu&amp;t have as its prime duty a responsibility &apos;to the communityto provide good service to its customers with the maximum possible  fici ency in the use both of manpower and of physical and financialResources.   That therefore is the   central  : aim with which this YThite^per is concerned.The attainment of the Post Office&apos;s objectives is the responsi-. and workforce&quot;ility of the board;      management^   The Government, v/hich appointsthe Chairman and board, has a duty to satisfy itself that they aredischarging their duties and making efficient use of the resourcesWaced in their trust.    It must avoid unnecessary interference withRESTRICTED^nagement.    But it must seek to provide a stable framework - includi:.:
clear financial, performance and service objectives - within which thePost Office can plan and invest, and it must ensure that the separateresponsibilities of the Government and the Post Office are v/ell dciiIie(*and understood.   The Government has sought to do this, in consults&quot;^0&quot;with the Post Office, and has set out certain objectives in this V/hitcPaper.12.     Achievement of good results will depend on the skills, knowl^Sre..rcand expertise of everyone in the Post Office as adaptations to cha^band new methods of working continue to become necessary.   The Govern^therefore attaches the greatest importance to the contribution of theseven trade union members on the board under the current two yearexperiment in industrial democracy.   V/ith this experiment the PostOffice has the opportunity to lead the way in developing new methodsof cooperation with its workforce at every level.    The Governmentbelieves that this new board, working in conjunction with normalprocedures for negotiation of pay and working conditions, will be ^to set an example of how industrial democracy can work in this countsand to show how technical change and improvements in performance canbetter be managed with the participation of employees at all levels.The GovernDent has sought to Ensure that users 1 views are also heard aboard level by appointing two members with experience of consumeraffairs.   This will serve to reinforee the established procedures *-consumer consultation through the Post Office Users1 Councils (PO^5and it is important that the two board members and   PQUNC      shouldin close contact with each other.   If the experiment in Industriedemocracy succeeds the future development of the Post Office can vpartnership in v/hich all participate, to the great benefit of v/orkerand consumers alike.
12A.    The Government has also agreed with the Chairman of the PostOffice that the appointment of a civil servant from the Departmentof Industry to the board may be appropriate when its composition isnext reviewed.    As the Government announced in the /White Paper on theNationalised Industries, it believes that appointing civil servantsto the industries1 boards can help not only to enable the Governmentto be aware at an   earlier stage of the thinking of the board but alsotheto give/board a clearer view, at a formative stage of their planning,of the wider objectives of Government policy.
ORGANISATION OF THE POST OFFICE13.    The Reviev; Committee recommended that the Post Office shouldbe divided into two new Authorities.   The first wauld comprise thePostal Business, together with Giro and Remittance Services as asubsidiary business with separate accounts.   The second would comp**the existing Telecommunications Business, together with the DataProcessing Service.   The Committee felt that the fundamental di&amp;eces between the two principal Businesses made their efficientoperation dependent on quite different factors: in posts, the efforofand efficiency/use of labour; in telecommunications, efficiency ao&quot;1 sothe use of expensive capital as well as labour.    The Committeefelt that the Post Off ice1 s long tradition of centralised manage^&apos;&quot;coupled with the enormous task of running two large and very differBusinesses, had inhibited sound strategic thinking, whereas statut0 *separation of the Businesses woiM allow each of the new AuthoriticSto concentrate on its own distinctive problems and opportunities.14.   The Post Office is already separated into individual Busine^for all operational and accounting purposes, and more recently the?6have been further deliberate efforts to pass responsibility downline to accountable management within each Busiress.   The Post 0f*board remains responsible for strategic issues, approving the plBnSproposed for each Business year by year and then Judging the sup-results, but the main management initiative rests within the Busithemselves.   The Government is confident that more can be achieve *this process of decentralisation throughthe Post Office!s proposals for more devoluof management decisions and consultation procedures, and for Sre&amp;flexibility and responsiveness in its management.
1ST &quot;ihe Government recognises that strong arguments have been putforward for carrying through these changes to their ultimate conclusion,namely the creation of a separate public corporation for each Business.fiut legislation to split the Post Office would be complex and itsPreparation and implementation would divert scarce managerial andadministrative skills at some cost, at least in the short term, to the&quot;Management priority that the Government considers should be given toPromoting efficiency and containing costs v/hile maintaining and wheretocciblo improving standards of service.   The Government would not wishlo take such far-reaching decisions on the future structure of the Post^fice before it has had a chance to assess the results of the curr- :r.Evolution of managerial responsibility and of the two-year experiment0n the Post Office board; this means that legislation cannot be broughtforward in the present Parliament.

iv -accountability and monitoring arrangements17.   the review committee concluded that &quot;the productivity of &quot;t^0post office falls short of that which should be achieved&quot;.    1*attributed this in some measure to what it considered the unsatisfatory framework of powers and relationships within which the posttheoffice operated.    it also concluded that^powers, resources andauthority of the post office users&apos; national council (pounc) as avoice for user interests were inadequate.aid *18.   the white paper on the nationalised industries (cmnd 7131)reviewed in the light of a report by the national economic dcvcmoffice (NEDO) the ways in which the nationalised industries comade more accountable and their relations with ministers and depaiments improved and clarified.    the nedo report had suggested thatpolicy council might be established for each industry, placed athe operating board.   the government has not proceeded with thisproposal because it would add another tier to the decision-takin^structure.    the post office review com: nittee also saw this asand rejected the proposal on the grounds that it would vest resp0sibility in a body composed of representatives of different in*iinpWv/hich would either compromise on issues of principle or would sfail to resolve them.    instead, and as part of its proposals f01separating the two businesses, the review committee proposed ^0establishment of a single council on post office and telecommand&apos;affairs to advise the secretary of state on the two authorities$operating plans and strategies and capital investment proposals&apos;    jrecommended that such a council should be entirely independentpost office; it should have the Dower and resources to conductown investigations and research and, in particular, a responseRESTRICtEDto satisfy itself as to the moans by which the two authorities
Monitored their performance and standards of service.   The Councilshould have the task of consideringjlcng-term communications strategy.19.   The Government is not convinced by the prescription offered bythe Review Committee.   In the Governmentfs view the creation of anadditional Council would detract from the role of the board and blurresponsibility.   The Council would in effect become another layer inthe process of decision-taking, an objection that the Review Co::.pitteoregarded as a serious flaw in the Policy Council proposal put forwardhy the KEDO.   On some issues it would formulate policies alternativeto those proposed by the Post Office, in effect second-guessing thedecisions of Post Office management.   This would be even more unwclco::.-^ a period when the Post Office board is itself placing greaterresponsibility on the individual Businesses so that it can concentrate0n strategic issues.20.   Nevertheless, the Government agrees that there is room for^proving the arrangements for settling policy objectives betweenthe Government and the Post Office, for further clarifying theirRespective responsibilities and for monitoring the Post Office&apos;sfinancial performance, productivity and standards of service.*he following paragraphs outline the Government&apos;s proposals, many ofV/hich flow from the general proposals in the V.nite Paper on theNationalised Industries.1.Performance aims and indicatorsjl&quot;   The Government accepts the Review CommitteeTs view that greaterpPhasis should be placed on indicators of economic efficiency. The,, thenitc Paper on/T:aionaliscckl&apos; T^&apos;tliS$ envisaged that the industriesv,ouDc\ rake public suitable aims in terms of performance and       v.&quot; v
to supplement their financial target.   The Government has according1? j\agreed aims with the Post Office for the   Telecommunications andPostal Businesses which will play an important part in the futurerelationship between the Post Office and the Government.   These ai^5are stated in paragraphs 37 and 46 below.   The Department of Industflis now discussing with the Post Office the provision of performanceindicators for the main services and will hold regular meetings WiPost Office management to consider progress towards improving produtivity and service.   The Government recognises, however, that therecan be no substitute for the Post Officefs management itself axlevel using performance indicators and targets as an integral toolmanagement and welcomes the Post Officefs positive proposals forthis.thei i. a22.   The White Paper on/Nationalised Industries envisaged thatindustries would select a number of key performance and serviceindicators, including historic series and valid international c0lDjtparisons, and publish them prominently in their annual reports.should t&amp;e   *is important that the Post O/fice, as a monopoly,/demonstratepublic that it is using its vast resources efficiently to proviobest possible service at the lowest prices.   The Post Office isdeveloping its ideas for publication of relevant information ano      iforthcoming g tfl9 pmake a start in its           Annual Report.   The Government welcoflPost Officefs decision to publish each quarter key national andregional statistics on telecommunications performance,ii.   International comparisons23.   The Review Committee recommended that the Department ofIndustry and the Post Office &quot;should compile detailed overseasRESTRICTEDv.
fo. v-v$comparisons to indicate how efficiently and productively the PostOffice carries out its tasks as measured against its main internationalcompetitors.&quot;   It recognised that this would be an extremely difficulttask, requiring the most detailed and expert knowledge but concludedthat there was a pressing need for such comparisons.   The Governmentagrees that valid international comparisons have a particularlyuseful part-fo play in monopoly services like posts and telecomrauni-cations.   The Post Office has done a great deal of work already on thissettingsubject.   The Department of Industry . is now   /   up a joint workingParty with the Post Office which will report to the Secretary ofState and to the board.**i. Business plans the^.   In line with the proposals in the White Paper on/Nationalised^dustries, the Government proposes to make the submission of annualten-year plans for each of the three Businesses at the turn of thecalendar year and detailed discussion of them the keystone of itsNations with the Post Office.    It will introduce legislation^Powering the Secretary of State to approve&quot; the Post Officefs long-*enn plans and policies and specify any matters with v/hich he considersthoy should deal.   This legislation would bring the Secretary of StatedPowers in relation to the Post Office into line with those providedin more recent natinnalised industry legislation.   Discussion of thePi&amp;ns with the Post Office will enable the Department to assess8t*ategic issues well ahead of the time when individual proposals fallf0r consideration.    It will also enable the Department to reviewWith the Businesses their long-term performance and service aims. It isEssential that the plans shuuld set out and appraise the main policy0Ptions and the Government welcomes the new impetus which the Post0ffice is giving to corpora^PpfannJ^g.    In addition to these arrange-
ments the Department v/ill continue to receive and discuss with thePost Office its annual five-year investment plans for each Businessand the regular financial returns.to gi*   1iv.    New power to issue specific directions25.   The Post Office Act 1969 empowers the Secretary of Statethe Post Office directions of a general character in the nationalinterest or to remedy a defect in its general plans or arrangements&apos;cted *The Secretary of State also has powers to give the Post Office dir-ections of a more specific character but these powers are restriccertain prescribed circumstances.   The . provisions are similar tothose in the statutes governing the other nationalised industries&apos;The Government explained in The White Paper on the Na t ionalisedIndustries that it considers it wrong in principle that a Ministershould not have a statutory power to intervene, subject to the a.of Parliament, in specific matters of major importance. It there orannounced its intention to introduce legislation amending the statuso as to enable Ministers to give nationalised industry boardsgeneral or specific directions on matters affecting the nationalinterest.ccd26.   As indicated in the V/hite Paper these new powers would be t*sparingly and v/ould be subject to a number of safeguards.   Therewould be powers to pay compensation to the industries where apPr0^to cover the extra cost.   The Government reaffirms its intention *uldseek an early opportunity to introduce such legislation,which woapply to the Post Office.A
v.       Strengthening POUNC27.     The Government recognises the importance of having a strong andindependent guardian cf the consumer interest to identify the issueswhich affect consumers and ensure that there is ready access to aConsidered view of what consumers want and need.    POUNC has a highrePutation as an effective consumer body.    The Government believestnat it would be right to build on POUNC and on the POUCs forScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and to provide the resourcesto enable them to do more research and in-depth study of issues thatconcem the consumer.    It also recognises the role which Post OfficeAdvisory Committees, of which there are about 200, can play at locallevel.The following measures are being taken to strengthen   FOUMC:i. In order to enable POUNC to call on a wider range of expertise,the Government proposes to introduce legislation giving it theright to employ its own staff and to- recruit from outside thecivil service, in line with other nationalised industry consumercouncils.This would not entail an   increase in staff numbers.ii. In the Governments proposals for legislation enabling thel cSecretary of State to approve the Post Office*s long-term plans(see paragraph^above), provision will also be made to requirePOUNC to be consulted about the long-term business plans.iii. The Government welcomes the Post Office*s proposalsfor consulting POUNC on the selection of published performanceand service indicators and for discussing regularly a range ofsuch indicators with POUNC.   The Post Office will continue toconsult POUNC as early as possible about proposed tariff andservice changes.
iv. In circumstances where the Post Office considered aparticular recommendation by POUNC unacceptable on normalcommercial criteria, the proposed power of specific directionby the Secretary of State for Industry (referred to inparagraphs 25 and 26 above) could apply.29.     Under the Chairmanship of the late Lord Peddie, POUNC        DUlltup a very close working relationship with the Post Office both onpolicy matters and in the handling of complaints and problems.Government is confident that this close relationship will continueand believes that POUNC has an important part to play in advisingthe Post Office and commenting on its plans and proposals.   POUNCwill also continue to be available to be consulted by Governmenton major issues affecting     users    of Post Office services.
V       INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY30        At the time the Review Committee were completing theirReport, Government proposals to introduce industrial democracyfor a two year experimental period at board level within thePost Office were already being considered by Parliament.   Sincethen Parliament has passed the legislation to enable theexperiment to go ahead.    This increased the size of the PostOffice board to a maximum of nineteen members in addition tothe Chairman, to allow for the appointment of up to seven manage-ment and seven trades union members, and five independentmembers, two of them with experience in consumer affairs.31        The Government attaches much importance to the developmentof industrial democracy within the nationalised industries.    Itis therefore particularly pleased that the experiment is alreadyUnder way, with the full support of management and unions.   TheGovernment hopes that this will help to demonstrate to industryat large the substantial benefits that can be derived fromindustrial democracy.32        In their Report the Review Committee suggested that thePath towards industrial democracy should begin with the develop-toent of employee participation at local level, followed at aiater date by industrial democracy at board level with theelected worker representatives forming a minority of the totalboard membership.   In the Post Office   a&quot; long tradition ofconsultation with the unions was already reflected in well-developedconsultative and negotiating procedures at local level providingRESTRICTED
invaluable experience for both management and trade unionists.It is on this sound foundation that the two-year experiment inindustrial democracy is built.   The Post Office&apos;s managementand unions were convinced from the outset of the discussionsthat an experiment in participation must extend to all levelsof the enterprise.   The development of industrial democracyat board level has received most public attention but theparticipation arrangements at regional and local levels whichare now-being established are an integral part of the two-yearexperiment.    The details of these arrangements are outlined inthe Post Office Annex to this White Paper.   The GovernmentnfficC*welcomes the development of this new framework in the Post uj.
VIMARKETING AND CUSTOMER RELATIONS33The Review Committee thought the Post Office needed toimprove its marketing capability and discover more about whatits customers wanted.    In particular it suggested that, in itspricing policies, the Post Office was too pre-occupied withfully-allocated costs and that it should make more use of short-run marginal cost pricing to keep and build traffic.   The Govern-ment welcomes the Post Office&apos;s intention to give the work ofmarket appraisal and of developing new opportunities high priorityIt also welcomes the Post Office!s full statement of its currentpricing policy in paragraph /97 of the Annex; the Governmentagrees with the Review Committee that the provisions of Section11(4) of the Post Office Act 19^9, designed to prevent theexercise by the Post Office of undue discrimination betweencustomers, do not preclude the application of short-run marginalcost pricing.34        The Review Committee also expressed concern about theimplications of the extent of the Post Office&apos;s statutoryexemptions from liability.   During the passage of the UnfairContract Terms Act through Parliament in 1977 it v/as agreed thatCodes of Practice would be drawn up to cover the services offeredby the Post Office and the redress customers might have incases where the services were not carried out satisfactorily.Initial proposals have been circulated to various consumerorganisations and other interested bodies and, in the light ofcomments received, Codes of Practice for each Post Officeservice are now being prepared by the Post Office in consultationwith the Post Office Usexs.UUaiJjonal Council and the   Office
of  Fair Trading. The Government considers thatagreed Codes of Practice will be a welcome step forward in sa^e&quot;guarding the interests of the individual consumer.35        The Review Committee made a number of other recommendationsabout the provision of better facilities for customers such asquick service positions and consumer contact points in main PostOffices.    The Government welcomes the Post Office!s proposalsfor improving facilities and hopes that the public will reap thebenefits of the Post Office boardfs intention to improve relation5with customers and standards and quality of service.J
VII TELECOMMUNICATIONS36        The use of telecommunications by private individuals and bybusiness is expanding rapidly world wide; and technological advanceis improving the range and reducing the cost of telecommunicationsservices available to the public.   Britain therefore needs to be inthe forefront of technical development so that it has advancedequipment installed in its own network and also available for salein export markets.    The Government has encouraged the Post Officeto move as rapidly as possible towards the next generation ofequipment, including computer-controlled exchanges integrated witheconomical systems of transmission.    All these developments arebeing brought together in the System X programme of modular tele-communications equipment, intended for introduction in Britain inthe early 1980s,37        The Review Committee was concerned that efficiency in theunBritish telecommunications service appeared to compare/favourablywith some of the highest standards attained overseas.   There is,indeed, much to be achieved in improving the quality and efficiencyof the basic telephone service and of data communications links forindustry and commerce.   It is also of great importance to thiscountry&apos;s competiveness that the fruits of technical improvementsand of the expansion of the network should be passed on to users inlower real prices.   This can only be done if productivity keepspace with the enormous investment being made in expanding andimproving the system.   The basic aim must be to achieve reductionsin real unit costs through increased utilisation of existing assetsand through more efficient methods of working with new equipment.In the light of discuss fo^^8n^J6ftire pians and objectives the
Government has agreed with the Post Office that it would beunitreasonable to look for a general reduction in the real ^bost ofthe telecommunications services faking 1977/78 as a base,of some5% per annum   over the five years to 1982/83.38        The actual charges for the services,which have been heldconstant since October 1975, will depend on the future rate ofinflation, but the attainment -of the new cost objective wouldThismean that charges were reduced significantly in real terms.    A1objective will supplement the existing financial objective forthe telecommunications services, currently a real rate of return6% per annum on average net assets.   The actual trend of realcosts against the objective will be published in future AnnualReports.39        One service on which the Telecommunications Business hasbeen losing money is telegrams.   The Government welcomes thePost Office!s determined effort to improve the viability of tniSservice.   Its future now depends on the fullest co-operation 0^all concerned in making a success of new marketing initiativesand operating techniques.A A1640        The importance of System X has already been stressea.Post Office is giving the programme the highest priority, anGstatement by the Post Office in the Annex to this White Paperexplains some of the specific steps that .have been taken to ^ee^the programme moving as quickly and effectively as possible.Government is directly interested in the progress being madebecause of the contributiftf iTJJIQpifem could make to the ef&apos;1
pand quality of the telecommunications service in this country andto the British manufacturing industry.System X equipment must beadvanced, reliable and competitive in price with overseas productsif Britain is to regain its position in the large overseasmarkets in telecommunications.    There would be major economicbenefits in bringing out highly competitive equipment but therewould be correspondingly serious costs to face if the programmeis not carried through to technical and exporting success quickly.The Government is therefore in close touch with the Post Officeand with the firms collaborating on the System X programme, andwill give any assistance that is practicable to help the programmesucceed.41        The Review Committee noted the importance in general of thePost Office looking very carefully at the effects of its actionson the supplying industry.    A strong telecommunications industryis crucially important to both the Post Office and the users ofits services.    The Government welcomes the Post Officefs recognitionof the need for a close working relationship as illustrated by themachinery for co-operating on System X.
VIII     POSTS42        The inland and overseas letter post services and the PostOffice parcels service are vital means of communication forbusiness and social purposes, and the Government is naturallyconcerned to see the greatest emphasis placed on the underlyin&amp;level of efficiency of these operations, and on measures to helpsustain the volume of traffic.43        The early 1970s had seen a sharp increase in wage inflationwhich imposed a particularly heavy burden on the labour intensivePostal Business.   The problem was increased by the postal stri^ein 1971 and by the imposition of an artificial constraint onpostal prices.   The necessary return to economic pricing, begun1973, when taken with increases in real labour costs, led tofalls in traffic, causing declining productivity and further rin unit costs.   Thus, notwithstanding internal economies and cUlin services, postal prices have increased at a faster rate thangeneral rate of price increases in Britain.   The -Postal BusincSrecognised that a continuation of this trend would have had &amp;errepercussions on the long-term viability of the business and ahas been taken to improve the situation.44        This action has halted the decline with the result thaftPostal Business is now in a much sounder financial situation.made profits in 1976/77 and 1977/78 and the Government has re     ^agreed with the Post Office a financial target for the businesSa 2/o return on turnover up to 1979/80.   Buoyancy in mail volllined  tJiehas made it possible to slow down the rise in prices.    IndeeZ,vj.c&apos;&apos;:5RESTRICTED 011 maiu    estrPost Office has undertaken that there will be no price chang
year so that the cost of letter services will have remainedunchanged for at least 18 months since the moderate increasesof June 1977.^5.       A further example of these improvements has been theturn-round in the financial health of the Post Office parcelsservice.    For many years this service had incurred heavy losses,reaching over  42m in 1974/75.   Since then the losses have beensubstantially reduced and the service is now covering its directcosts and making an appreciable contribution to Postal Businessoverheads.    The Government particularly welcomes this since itregards the Post Office1s parcels operation as an essentialelement of the basic postal service, providing delivery to alladdresses within the. community.    It also accords with theGovernment&apos;s views on the way forward for public sector parcelsas set out in the recent White Paper on Transport Policy (Cmnd 6836).46 *      The Government is concerned now to see that these achieve-ments by the Post Office are sustained and accordingly has agreedwith the Post Office that a central objective over the next fiveyears should be to contain the overall real unit cost of postalservices.    In particular the Government attaches importance to thepart work measurement can play in achieving cost reduction andwould like to see an early agreement between the management andunions concerned on this important issue.   There will of courseneed to be some adjustments in tariffs over the years, but theobjective is that, taking 1977/78 as the base.,they should notoverallincrease^any faster over the five years to 1982/83 than the generalRESTRICTEDlevel of prices in the economy.   The alternative to price and
and service stability is bleak.   Any return to the spiral of risingunit costs against falling volume would mean a steady decline in thepostal service which would threaten not only the facilities availableto the community but also the livelihood of those providing them.This is particularly true at a time when letter post is likely to comeunder increasing competition from other methods 6f communication.47.     In order to sustain the hard won&quot;improvements it will be essentifor the Postal Business to increase volume by imaginative and energetlmarketing of postal services, and to combine this v/ith vigorous acti01to improve productivity and thus reduce costs - but not at the expenSof standards of service.   The Letter Mechanisation   Programme has animportant part to play in this.   The Post Office is convinced that,the original&apos;cost-estimates having teen brought up-i;o-da-te,.. the prog?will show a satisfactory return on the investment involved and thatthe uncompleted part of the programme will show an even higher returnp i5The Government accepts the Post Office&apos;s view that the right course   ^accordingly to press ahead so that the programme is completed as QuxCas possible.    In spite of changes in collection and delivery arran ements over the last decade the standards achieved by Britainfs PoS, fove^&apos;service still compare favourably with standards overseas and the ^ment regards it as important that they should continue to do so.48.     The 1980s will not be easy for the Postal Business and thefinancial and performance objectives agreed between the Governmentand        Post Office are demanding.   The Government welcomes the PoSOffice*s proposals for action to meet these objectives in the year5ahead and its determination to carry them through.
ix    giro^9.   Giro was established in 1968 to provide a rapid and convenientmoney transfer system through Post Offices.   This is now firmlyestablished and Giro is offering an expanding range of banking services&quot;to private users, to public bodies and to commerce.    It provides asignificant and expanding element of the Post Office!s counter servicesbusiness.   Over the last three years Giro has met the financial targetof a return of 12^% on Public Dividend Capital plus retained profitswhich was set in 1976 when authority was given to an increase in itsrange of activities; it has also paid dividends on its PublicDividend Capital.   This is an achievement v/hich reflects credit on allconcerned in Giro, having regard to the fact that it has had to establishitself in a fiercely competitive sector of banking.50,   The Review Committee supported the proposal that Giro might beamalgamated with the National Savings Bank.   The desirabilityof such a merger and the complex questions involved are also underconsideration by the Government.
POST OFFICE COUNTER AND OTHER SERVICES51        A wide range of services is provided at Post Office counters.The Post Office as an agent of the Government plays a major part inthe social security machinery in Britain.    The Government agreeswith the Review Committee that the size of the network of CrownPost Offices and sub-Post Offices is about right, that the counterservice should remain under the control of the Post Office, andthat the Post Office should continue to be properly remunerated *&quot;orall the work carried out on behalf of Government Departments.There is also a good case for allowing the Post Office to act asthe agent of other nationalised industries, and the Governmentintends to introduce legislation to permit this type of agencywork to be undertaken by the Post Office.    Post Office countersplay an important part generally in the life of local communitieSand the Government attaches the greatest importance to the PostOfficefs efforts to respond sensitively and flexibly to localneeds.In some rural areas the Post Office has introduced Postbus52to carry oassengers as well as mail.   This helps to keep downrecosts of the mail service and provides passenger transport inwhere no other public transport operates.   The Government issatisfied that the merits of the Postbus have been demonstrated,lopespecially in Scotland.    It is now up to the Post Office to devthe system in suitable areas, and the Government is suggesting *local authorities and Traffic Commissioners that they might takea constructive view of any new proposals put forward by locaiOffice managers.   The Post Office is already &quot;encouraging themanagers of the postal ser$t?$TltifCfn&apos;ew wavs of supplement^
revenue by providing new services and the introduction of Postbusesand of local delivery of newspapers and periodicals are examplesof the benefits that this new flexibility can bring to isolatedcommunities.
IXI&quot;   POST OFFICE PENSION FUND53.    An important factor affecting the cost of postage andtelecommunications has been the growing deficiency in the Post 0f^cepensions fund.   This first became apparent some years ago, and theReviev; Committee urged that special measures were necessary to Putthe fund bock on a sound footing.   The necessity each year to findincreasing sums to cover the deficiency has been an additional burdenon the Businesses causing continuing concern to both management andstaff.   The Government therefore &quot;welcomes the proposals put forwardby the Post Office for dealing with the main problem of funding tnepre-Corporation deficiency, and has agreed in principle to thescheme described in the Post Office statement at the end of thisWhite Paper, which will involve no increase in public expenditure.The Government believes that these proposals will provide a soluti01to this long-standing problem   acceptable to all concerned. pt
CONCLUSION54.   There are important challenges facing   the Post Office over thecoming years.   The Postal Business has been bnught back to profita-oility and now, in the face of new methods of communication, a con-tinuing effort v/ill be required from all concerned to contain costs,so that its future can be safeguarded and this country can continue^o enjoy high standards of mail service.   The task of the Telecommunic-ations Business is to take advantage of new developments to offerbusiness and private users a wider range of services, as well as abasic telephone service on a par with the best; and to continue tob^ing down the relative cost of telecommunications.   Giro, throughthe v/idespread network of Post Offices, is well placed to make adistinctive contribution to further expansion of personal banking.The Post Office leads the way in the development of industrial democracy*ft this country.   The Government is confident that everyone in the^ost Office will seize the opportunities ahead and will recognise how^Uch there is to be gained by workers and consumers alike from aPositive partnership between management and workforce in applying newteclinology and in the search for the highest standards of efficiency*ftd service.
aN1FrictedINTRODUCTION1 This annex gives Post Office views on major aspects ofthe Report by the Review Committee,  other than those which arcthe primary responsibility of Government.    It also reports onProgress being made in respect of important matters on which theCommittee commented.    The aim is to provide an effectivesummary of Post Office views, without a lengthy catalogue ofcomments related to every specific recommendation.2 The Post Office accepts many of the Committee&apos;specommcndations,  a good number of which reflect Post Officee*pressed views,  and has studied the background comment in theReport with care.    It is far from complacent about the criticismswhich were made.     However the Committee said that  their&quot;recommendations are intended to encourage improvement but notto threaten or disrupt the many things which are already good&quot;.The Post Office welcomes that approach and is following up the^commendations in a positive spirit.
SECTION 1    GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND POLICYAims3 It is the duty of the Post Office,  as laid down by thePost Office Act 1969,  to meet the social,   industrial andcommercial needs of the nation in the exercise of its powersto provide postal,  telecommunications and giro services.    Itaims to discharge this duty in such a way as to provide goodand reliable services to the customer while keeping charges aslow as they can be consistent with the financial targets agreedwith Government.4 To meet these aims it is clearly crucial that management1sapproach should be such as to encourage the maximum efficiencythroughout the organisation.    The Review Committee&apos;s Reportreferred to their misgivings about what they regarded as themarkedly centralised style of management in the Post Office,and the Post Office agrees there is a need for greater decentral-isation,  flexibility,  and responsiveness in its management.Efficiency and Productivity5 The new Chairman took up office on 1 November 1977 andimmediately initiated the development of a policy of givingmanagers freedom of action over the widest possible range ofactivities,  reserving to management at the higher levels only
those matters where service to the rest of thc country mightbe affected,  or which are governed by national agreements withthe unions.    Managers are being encouraged to show greaterlocal initiative,  and to encourage their own staff in similarfashion.    In this way the Post Office believes it can improvefurther its efficiency of operation and the quality and speedof its decision taking,  as well as encourage a greater sense ofpurpose and dedication at all levels.6 At the basic working level the achievement of this greatersense of purpose and dedication would be of the highest valuein the pursuit of greater productivity,  the need for which isfully accepted by the Post Office and remains one of its majoraims.    The problems of productivity improvement differ markedlybetween the two main&quot; businesses as will be shown in the sectionsbelow which deal with them individually.7 The customer will benefit directly from the greateremphasis on devolution which will encourage local managers tomake decisions more closely tailored to local circumstances.The primary aim is to create an environment in which the localmanager has a much more personal influence on performance,efficiency and business volume.    The Post Office firmly believesthat this policy will be good for its customers and staff.
8 Devolution must however be accompanied by effectivemonitoring and accountability.    Monitoring will increasinglybe exercised through the medium of operational,   quality ofservice and financial performance indices.    There are alreadymany such  indices in use but the Post Office is currentlyextending their range and sharpening up some of the existingones.    In particular the Post Office is examining the developmentoT relevant statistics of international comparisons.     Performanceindices will form an essential part of the internal planningand control documents which circulate regularly to the variouslevels of management.    Additionally some of the more importantaims and  indices will be featured in the annual Report andAccounts.     Discussions are taking place between the Post Officeand the Department  of Industry about  the  inclusion of moreperformance  indices  in the  regular reports which are sent  tothat Department.Financial  Disciplines9 The primary objective of the Post Office,  to providecommunications services to meet the needs of its customers atthe lowest possible cost consistent with financial  targets agreedwith Government  (see para 3 above),  has importcint  implicationsfor pricing policies,  the main objectives of which are as followsa Each business should earn sufficient revenue to.meet its financial targets.    There should accordingly beno cross-subsidisation of one business by another.
b Within each business subsidisation of one serviceby another should be avoided where possible.    As aminimum,  each service should be priced so as to coverits direct costs.c Where appropriate short run marginal costs may beused in pricing services (eg if there is spare capacityavailable) provided this would produce a worthwhilefinancial contribution to fixed costs,  to the benefitof all services, and does not lead later on to investmentin replacing assets which cannot earn an adequate rate ofreturn.The Post Office pricing policy ensures that customers are fairlytreated and that there is no discrimination against a particular&apos;group.    It also provides for the profitable exploitation ofservices,  old and new,  to the benefit of customers.10        Each business has its own financial target which has beenagreed with Government.    The Telecommunications target requiresthe business to earn a 6% return (before interest)  on its meannet assets revalued to replacement costs.    Posts target is 2% Pr(after interest)  on turnover.    Giro&apos;s target is a return of12/ &amp; on its Public Dividend Capital plus retained profits.    Inrecent years the Post Office has made healthy and growing profitand in the last financial year each business achieved itsfinancial target.    As a result it is currently financing thewhole of its capital investment programme from revenue and inaddition has recently made early repayments of some large foreiPloans.    This healthy financial position provides a sound basisRESTRICTED
for service  improvement and expansion.    The Post Office is astrong advocate of formally agreed financial targets and thuswelcomes the Government1s statement  in the  recent White Paperon Nationalised Industries  (Cmnd 7131)  that  they are seen ascentral  to the guidelines which Nationalised Industries expectfrom Government.     The Post Office hopes they will form apermanent part of the relationship with Government.11        The Post Office is continuing to strengthen its financialcontrol systems for both capital and current expenditure at alllevels within the organisation.    Much effort is going into theimprovement of the financial and management accounting systemsfrom grass  roots level to the top.     The Board receives monthlymanagement  reports which provide comparisons of cumulativeactual and budgeted expenditure,  revenue, cind profit and loss, aswell as updated forecasts for the year as a whole.12        The Board has recently approved a proposal for the completere-design of the telecommunications financial accounting system,using the most up-to-date computer facilities and reflectingthe highest financial control standards.    Specifically the newaccounting system will make financial information availablemuch more quickly.    It will provide a much more effective andflexible analysis of expenditure and revenue and will greatlysharpen up the analysis of variances.    It will also providelocal managers with timely and high quality financial  information,which will be a valuable aid to control, and also a much moreaccurate assessment of the profitability of individual services,
which will be important for marketing &quot;purposes.    ThePostal Business too is developing a new integrated accountingsystem.    The businesses are examining proposals for changesin the budgetary control arrangements designed to encouragelocal managers to maximise marketing opportunities.Pension Fund Deficit13        A major financial problem facing the Post Office inrecent years has been the funding of its considerable pensionfund deficiency which stood at  1920m at  the  last actuarialvaluation.    More than half of this derives from the periodwhen the Post Office was a Government Department.    This problemof the pro-Corporntion deficiency has been much publicised andattracted a good deal of consideration by the Committee.Recently thc Post Office has produced a possible solution whichhas been accepted in principle by the Government and which willnot  lead to any increase in public expenditure.    Details arestill being worked out with all the interested parties but theproposal basically will relieve customers of the need to financethrough tariffs the pre-Corporation deficiency which currentlyadds about ! p to the cost of a letter and %p to a phone call.Under thc new scheme the pension fund would be issued with aninterest bearing security which would be created from pastprofits held in the general reserve of the Post Office.    Thevalue of this security would be equal to the pre-Corporationdeficiency.    The effect would be to relieve all Post Officecustomers of the need to finance the pre-Corporation deficiencyfrom tariffs.    The new scheme has been a major factor in allowingthe Post Office to announce.a continuing period of pricerestraint. RESTRICTED
Corporate Planning14        The Post Office firmly believes that corporate planninghas a vital role to play in determining the long term size,shape and scope of its services and it is currently workingon proposals to strengthen considerably its corporate planningactivities.    This is of particular importance to Telecommunicationswhere rapid technological developments will provide considerablescope for improving existing services and^introducing new ones.These will require substantial investment in the replacementof existing equipment and in research and development in orderto ensure that its customers will have access to facilitiesand services which will compare with the best in the world.Corporate planning will also continue to have an importantplace in the Postal Business.    Its problems arc very differentfrom those of Telecommunications and will primarily be concernedwith the management of a labour intensive business in whichmany outside factors lead in the long term to an expectationof decline rather than growth.Relations with Staff15        In order to plan with confidence for the future,  as wellas to conduct its operations efficiently from day to day,  thePost Office attaches enormous importance to maintaining andfurther developing a relationship of mutual trust and co-operationwith its staff.    For many years, at all levels in the Corporation,the Post Office has been operating consultation and negotiating
machinery more comprehensive in terms of range of subjectscovered and degree of information provided than is to befound in most other industries.    The issues discussed go wellbeyond the conventional range of collective bargaining,  coveringthe whole field of Post Office operations,  finance and forwardplanning.     It is indeed partly because of the existence of thatwell established machinery that the Post Office has beenregarded by Government as a particularly suitable industry inthe public sector for introducing a major tv/o year experimentin industrial democracy.    At Post Office Board level theexperiment began on 1 January 1978,  and there are now inaddition to the Chairman 6 &quot;management&quot; Members,  7 part-timeMembers nominated by the Post Office unions and 5 other part-time Members,  including 2 specifically chosen as beingexperienced in consumer affairs.16        The industrial democracy experiment is currently beinglaunched at regional and area levels,  also.    Eleven RegionalBoards are in the process of being reconstituted with up to7 management,  7 Post Office union and 5 outside members.    AreaPolicy Committees consisting of management and trade unionnominees are also being set up in each General Manager&apos;s andHead Postmaster&apos;s area.17        The aims of the whole experiment are broadly to providebetter informed,  speedier and more effective decision taking,to facilitate the smooth implementation of key decisions,  andto involve employees more directly in the formative stage ofpolicies affecting them.    The Post Office believes that theadditional blend of experience and expertise may improve
decision making.     If the experiment works successfully -and it would be premature to make any judgement at thisstage - this increase in staff involvement in policy andplanning matters could assist in achieving better mutualunderstanding and motivation and lead to improvements inproductivity,  efficiency and customer service.    This approachis of course in line with Government policy as outlined in therecent White Paper on Industrial Democracy (Cmnd 7231).Service  to Customers18        As was made clear initially the Post Office is veryconcerned that good service to customers should be combinedwith efficiency of operation and it has therefore consideredcarefully the criticisms of the Review Committee concerningattitudes to its customers.    The Post Office fully recognisesthat the pressures placed upon it by financial constraints inrecent years may have led to customer views being given tpolittle weight in the formulation of policy and that there is aneed to regain their confidence.    To this end the Board is givingrenewed emphasis to the maintenance of, and wherever possible animprovement to,  standards of service;  price increases or servicereductions will not be contemplated until all other alternativeshave been pursued.19        Because of the concern to improve the quality of servicegiven to the customer,  a committee of non-executive Members ofthe Post Office Board, known as the Quality of Service Committee,has recently been set up;  this includes in its membership thetwo Members with special experience of consumer affairs  (seepara 15 above).    Its activities include a study of the qualityRESTRICTED
of service given to the customer by the Postal andTelecommunications Businesses,  and an assessment of thevalidity of present statistical and sampling methods.    TheCommittee will also aim to provide a separate evaluationof performance and to identify the areas where improvementsshould be made.20        The Post Office recognises that whenever there is directpersonal contact between the customer and the organisation,whether face-to-face, by telephone,  or in correspondence,  itis very important that its approach should be open and helpful:this is being emphasised more in staff training.    Efforts arealso being increased both to provide more information aboutservices, and to stimulate their use in ways which benefit boththe Post Office and its customers.    This theme is followed upin the sections on Telecommunications (paras 29-31) andPosts  (paras 42-43) where examples of specific campaigns arequoted.21        In the handling of relations between the Post Office andits customers the role of the Post Office Users1  NationalCouncil  (POUNC) has been steadily developing.    The Post Officebelieves that much of the credit for this must go to the lateLord Peddie who,  as Chairman of the Council for the last nineyears,  exercised an extremely valuable and powerful influenceon behalf of all customers.He ensured that POUNCperformed a very useful function not only in handling complaintsbut also in helping in the formulation of policy.
However the Post Office believes that there is stillroom for improved procedures to ensure that the complaintsor grievances of customers are handled in a fair andeffective way.    One of the courses which is being pursuedis the preparation of Codes of Practice.    These will show howthe Post Office is committed to try to put right things whichgo wrong from time to time and will tell customers how to takeup any difficulties with the Post Office;  they will alsoindicate what steps customers can take if they are dissatisfiewith the outcome of representations to the Post Office.    Theformulation of the Codes has involved lengthy consultationswith POUNC, who have in turn consulted many other consumer,trade and political interests both or the principles involvedand on the details of content.    The Office of Fair Trading isalso giving its advice and help.    The Codes will deal with allthe most common areas of dispute between the Post Office andits customers.
SECTION  2     TELECOMMUNICATIONSEfficiency and Productivity22        Since thc Corporation was set up in 1969,  theTelecommunications Business has grown much more quickly thanthe economy as a whole.    The number of telephone lines andcalls has increased by an average of over 1% a year, whilestaff numbers have fallen slightly.    Return on net assets hasmore than doubled,  while telecommunications prices as a wholehave increased more slowly than the growth in the Retail PriceIndex over the period.    For the future,  the Business is planningfor a further continuing reduction in the real cost oftelecommunications services.    This will be achieved by moredetermined marketing of services,  growth of new technologies,better exploitation of existing plant,  and continued improvementin manpower productivity.    The Business can expect continuedgrowth but it is important that such growth should be wellmanaged.Market ing23        The marketing policy of the Telecommunications Businessis to improve services to existing customers by providing anincreasing choice of products and services,  and to make themavailable to every household and business.    Marketing,  and inparticular well-directed promotional activity,  also plays animportant part in increasing the usage of the assets in thesystem and so keeping prices down.     (Most telecommunicationscharges have,   indeed,  not increased for nearly 3 years,  duringwhich time other prices generally have moved rapidly upwards.)RESTRICTED
The campaign encouraging domestic telephone usage is to besupplemented shortly by a programme of help to businesscustomers in maximising the effective use of telecommunicationsin their particular business.24        The timely development of new products and services -and the effective marketing of existing ones - is criticallydependent on market research,  which has,  for many years,  beena vital tool for the Business in developing its wide range ofproducts and services in ways best suited to customer needs.Nevertheless the Committee&apos;s view that the Business shouldknow a great deal more about its markets is shared.    Marketresearch has now been aided by completion of the vast task ofcomputerising all records of customers&apos;  installations, whichenables existing and potential markets to be analysed in adepth that was not practicable with the old manual records.Detailed studies of specific sectors of the business marketare now in hand.    These will greatly improve knowledge of theproduct and service requirements of particular market sectors.The development and marketing of new products is being givenadded impetus by reorganisation of the Business headquartersmarketing function on a product group management basis, bringingtogether under one head the various disciplines and talentsrelevant to each type of product, which is in line with asuggestion by the Committee.    No less than 25 new products andservices are planned for introduction in the current year alone.
25        Prestel,  the Post Office viewdata service, which wasinvented and developed at the Post Office Research Centre,is an example of enterprise in developing new services,  andof willingness to co-operate with the private sector.    Itsaim is to bring the benefits of computer information retrievalto the general public,  by reducing the cost and difficulty ofcomputer usage.    This work is well ahead of any foreigndevelopment,  has attracted world wide interest and has alreadyled to sales to West Germany and the^Netherlands.    The PostOffice is contributing its own invention and expertise andjoining in partnership with the television receiver industry,who arc supplying the specially modified TV receivers,  and witha wide range of organisations who,  in various ways,  are involvedin the information industry.Supply of Telecommunications Products26        The Committee considered whether the Post Office monopolyas regards the supply of terminal equipment should be changed,and in the light of their comments the Post Office has reviewedthe position,  taking account of practice in other countries.Obviously,  greater customer choice is a desirable objective,but in pursuit of this two fundamental requirements forefficient telecommunications services must not be ignored:the main telecommunications network must be protected,  andsatisfactory communication between all users of the servicesmust be ensured.
27        Accordingly,  the Post Office view is that it is inthe interests of all users that all customer apparatus formingan integral part of its public switched telecommunicationsservices should be installed and maintained by the Post Office.However the supply of large PABXs,  the supply and maintenanceof the increasing variety of devices which are in effectperipheral attachments making use of the basic public telephone,Telex and Datel services,  and the supply of any apparatus forconnection to private circuits rented from the Post Office,  isnow and should continue to be freely open to competition,provided that essential technical and safety requirements aremet.    Such peripheral &quot;attachments&quot; to the public services rangefrom simple and widely used automatic fire alarms to computers,and from telephone answering machines to Prestel-equippcd TVsets.    As a result of this policy there arc now over 1800different designs of such privately supplied &quot;attachments&quot;permitted by the Post Office for use with its public telephone,Telex and Datel services alone, and a further 5000 designs areauthorised for connection to private circuits.    The rate ofgrant of consents for new designs of attachments has nearlytrebled in the past 5 years and is now running at some 1600 ayear.28        As the Committee recognised,  the increasing range of newservices that developing technology will make possible willpose,  constantly,  new problems of precise definition of boundaries-
In the Post Office view these boundaries should continue tobe approached in the light of the basic principles set outabove.    This does not,  of course, mean that the Post Officewill have,  or seek,  the monopoly of provision of all serviceswhich use telecommunications.    Indeed in the case of Prestel,for instance,  the reverse has already been demonstrated.Service to Customers29        The Telecommunications Business Is committed to improveits relationships with its customers and in particular to showthat  it is an approachable,  friendly organisation,   responsiveto customer needs,  and helpful in dealing with problems.    The&apos;Buzby&apos;  advertising campaign and the slogan  &apos;we&apos;re here to helpyou1, which is now to be found on most telecommunicationsadvertising material,  help to support  the drive being made withinthe Business to train and encourage staff to adopt a more help-ful and positive approach towards customers.    The Code ofPractice (para 21) will play an important part in this approach.30        To increase the information available to customers,  andto improve staff motivation,  key national and regional statisticson telecommunications service performance are to be publishedquarterly,   in line with the Committee&apos;s recommendations.Consultation with POUNC has of course been important in theformulation of these proposals.      The measurement of telephonecall successes and failures is in the process of computerisation,which will be completed by about 1982 and will much improve theinformation available for all purposes.    However,  starting thisyear booklets showing national and regional results for the yearare to be made available to customers and Regions will alsoRESTRICTED
produce booklets showing local performance.31        A further measure to make the Business more readilyaccessible to customers,  present or potential,  is the openingof Telephone Showrooms in major towns and cities.    TheShowrooms will be in main shopping areas, v/ith thc first onesopening this year and over 50 planned to be in operation by1980.Mai ntonance32        The Commit tee&apos;s observation that telephone servicemaintenance in this country is less effective than in the Bellsystem needs to be set in the context of their recognition,elsewhere in the report,  that Strowger exchange equipment,  whichcomprises by far the major part of the UK system,  is obsolescent,and that the more modern systems now being introduced  (crossbarand TXE4)  offer significant advantages in terms of maintenanceand quality of service.    Bell has replaced much of its olderplant by modern swi telling equipment and now uses only 31% ofStrowger equipment,  principally at the fringes of thc network(compared with 83% Strowger in the UK, much of it in key areasof the network).    There is evidence that  the defect levels forStrowger exchanges are not dissimilar in the two systems inbroadly comparable conditions.    As the Report recognises,  faultsin the UK system have declined significantly in recent years,and with increasing penetration of modern systems and theintroduction of computer aids to maintenance this trend willconti nue.
Tol(\v;r-.in) Services33        An example of the difficulties the Business faces intrying to combine financial  and technical realism with adesire to give the public all the services it wants can beseen in the problem of the inland and overseas telegram services.Both services have been making a loss as traffic declines,but the Business is determined to manage both services so thatthey serve the public as well as covering their long-runavoidable costs.    Achievement of this&apos;aim depends on theeffectiveness of new marketing initiatives and new operatingtechniques.    It depends strongly also on the fullest co-operationbetween management and unions in making these changes.    Toprovide the right sort of framework the Inland and Internationa]Telegram Services have therefore been brought into an organisationthe Telegram Services Executive - in which senior managementeffort is concentrated on making both services contribute usefullyand efficiently to the Telecommunications Business.System X34        The Review Committee rightly treated System X as the keyto the future of the Telecommunications Business.    The PostOffice welcomes their recognition that System X is sound inconcept and that it is vital for the standing in world marketsof British telecommunication suppliers.    The development mustbe successful if the Post Office is to provide the service itscustomers need without huge purchases of foreign designedequipment and if the British telecommunications industry isto flourish, with all that means for export sales.
35        The Committee explored the difficulties of handlingthis development,  given the differing interests of threeindependent manufacturers and the Post Office.    The Pest Officeis in agreement with much of their analysis and has set up anew department dedicated solely to the development and launchof System X, with a Director responsible for the project.Outside advice on Research and Development policy, which theCommittee thought to be desirable,   is also being provided throughan Engineering Advisory Committee,  chaired by Sir George Macfarlane,who was a member of the Review Committee and has since beenappointed to the Post Office Board.    The Advisory Committeeincludes cxperti: from outside the Post Office.36        Progress is now such that about 90% of the hardwaredesign for the first two types of application - a digital  trunkexchange and a medium sized local exchange - has been completedand prototypes are being made and tested.    The first systems willbe assembled at the manufacturers&apos; works during this year,  readyfor trials from the beginning of 1979.    Models for Post Officeevaluation will be assembled in 1979.    Orders for the firstoperational exchanges have been speeded up and they are plannedto come into service in 1981.37 -      Because it acknowledges the importance of the developmentto the export prospects of British industry the Post Office istrying to be as responsive as possible to the industry&apos;s needsand views.    Discussions have been launched with manufacturers
on the main equipment ordering programme,   the build up ofSystem X production capacity, and its impact on existingsystems.    An Export Product Planning Group has been establishedby the industry to study the requirements of overseas markets,and their representatives also attend meetings at which PostOffice requirements are identified and jointly assessed.38        The Telecommunications Business is thus putting atremendous amount of effort into switching development, andexpenditure on System X in the current year will be over  27m.Overall research and development expenditure is running at 77m per year to ensure that Post Office    services can bedeveloped and expanded to meet the needs of the whole countryduring the next decade or two.    The Post Office is trying tocarry out this programme in a way which also helps the Britishtelecommunications industry to increase its share of worldmarkets.
SECTION  3     POSTSEffjcicncy and Productivity39        Thc Postal Business aims to provide high quality services,tailored to customers1  requirements,  with charges at a minimumconsistent with the financial target  (2% profit on turnover)  setby the Government.    A prime requirement if these aims are to bemet on a long term basis is a sustained improvement in productivity.This can be achieved in two ways:  by growth of business andby greater output per man.    The Business aims to achieve themaximum possible improvement in productivity by growth ofbusiness but that alone will not suffice:  an improvement inoutput per man is an essential requirement to the health of thePostal Business.40        UK wage  rates can be expected tc  rise progressively in realterms and. with pay and associated costs constituting 80% oftotal costs,  it is vital  that the effect is countered by higherproductivity.    If it is not, postal service prices will risebroadly in line with wages and traffic will decline.    With some40% of mails service costs virtually fixed,  falling trafficinevitably leads to higher unit costs with the ultimate dangerof a rising.cost/price spiral.    Efforts to achieve higher man-power productivity are hampered by lack of comprehensive dataon traffic volumes flowing through the various parts of thesystem.    But introduction of a satisfactory traffic measuring
system has been consistently opposed by postal staff whowould be involved in the collection and processing of thenecessary statistical data.    Negotiations are however currentlytaking place on a revised productivity scheme which would canywith it the introduction of traffic measurement.41        There are other areas in which it has been possible tomake progress more readily.    Greater emphasis is now beingplaced on financial  rather than physical controls.    Cash budget-(in addition to staff hour budgets)  for all expenditure whichlocal managers can directly influence have already beenintroduced in many offices and will be extended to all by 3 979.A   &quot;contribution centre&apos;   concept is also being examined together-with proposals for speeding up the preparation of internalfinancial and management accounts.    Although much remains tobe done there has been encouraging progress during the pasttwo years during which manpower productivity has risen by about2%,Service to the Customer42 The objective is growth based on reliable service, custofliecare and enterprising marketing.    To this end:the sales force is being expanded;- advertising is being increased;
closer ties are being developed with POUNC,trade associations etc;a Code of Practice is being prepared for publication;- information services are being expanded,  egdistribution of leaflets giving latest postingtimes for first class mail to achieve next daydelivery;more enquiry facilities arc being provided atpost offices;- arrangements are being made to improve and expedite,the handling of complaints and correspondence.43        The Postal Business is also undertaking a campaign toimprove the quality of its mails services and win the confidenceof its customers.     Specific projects are:improvement in the reliability and speed of mailmovement over certain difficult routes, eg wherethere are transport problems;a general programme for tackling  &apos;black spots1,eg offices where there are critical staff recruitmentprobIems;consideration with POUNC of ways of making qualityof service statistics more meaningful to thecustomer.
Marketing and  Pricing44        Market research is an essential pre-requisite foreffective market planning to meet customer needs.     The  PostOffice has already completed a comprehensive research programmeto quantify and analyse the components of the letter marketwhich is believed to be more thorough than anything carried outby any other postal administration.    Building on this foundationthe Post Office is now undertaking ,cven more detailed researchinto each market sector with particular regard to the needs ofsmall traders.    Expenditure on market research in 1978-79 willbe nearly double that  in 1977-78,  involving extensive use ofprofessional consultants.45        The Review Committee thought there was a tendency toconcentrate too much on the very big customers.    Until  recentlythis part of the market offered the most scope for profitablenew business,  but: marketing is now increasingly being directedat a much wider range of customers.    The Postal Business isparticularly keen to promote its services with smaller businessesand individual customers:  encouraging progress has already beenmade in this area,  for example with local parcel delivery andair parcel services.    These have been marketed with the smallertrader and exporter particularly in mind.46        One aspect of pricing policy to which the Committee gaveparticular attention was the use of short run marginal costs.
There was  1 i r t 1 e  scope for marginal  p-ricint; during the periodwhen price restraint policies resulted in uneconomically lowtariffs and substantial financial losses.    Now that overallprofitability has been restored the position has changed andthe  last year or so has seen the  introduction of a number ofmarginally priced services -  the new Household Delivery Servicefor unaddressed circulars,  the Rural Newspaper Delivery Service,the Direct Mail Deposit Scheme  (to help the advertising industry)and the rapid extension of the &quot;same day&quot; Exprcsspost deliveryservice.    Short run marginal pricing is also used in volumeincentive arrangements with business customers and for introductoryoffers to industrial markets.    Further opportunities are beingexplored.the parcels service has been overtaken by events,   and aremarkable success has been achieved.    More flexible pricingpolicies,  enterprising marketing, and cost savings achieved inclose collaboration with the Unions, followed by a period ofprice stability,  have all contributed to a dramatic reversal offortune as  illustrated by  the following financial  results:Pa rc els47Much of the Committee&apos;s criticism of,  and proposals for,1974-751975-761976-771977-78 44.8m (72%) 42.8m (49%) 23.6m (23%) 5.0m (4%)loss on  income of   61.9mloss on income of   87.2mloss on  income of  101.2mloss on income of  125.0m(provi sional)
The parcel service is now making a very substantial contributionto postal service fixed costs and future prospects are good.48        The Committee suggested that the parcel concentrationscheme should be modified or abandoned.    It has in fact alreadybeen modified;  the system currently operates on a basis of32 centres of which 19 are mechanised instead of thc originalconcept of 27 fully mechanised centres.    The organisation willnot be static;   it will continue to be modified to meet therequirements of the parcel  service as it changes and develops,and the mechanisation of further offices will be consideredindividually using normal  investment criteria.    Abandonmentof concent ratio?! would add to costs:   thc new conveyancearrangements which concentration allows have alone producedtransport savings of  4m per annum.    Furthermore,  a muchgreater proportion of parcel  post movement is now under directPost Office control,  a key factor in seryice reliability.49        The Post Office has long shared the Committee&apos;s view thatuniform national tariffs are not appropriate for substantialsectors of the parcels market.    Some 50% of all its parcelbusiness is covered by contracts reflecting negotiated prices.In addition there are flexible pricing arrangements for:Datapost,  a premium overnight facility for urgentconsignments;
- a local contract: service for stores and othertraders requiring delivery over short distances;Night-rider,  a fast growing special contract servicein London;County Parcels,  a retail service offering lowerrates for delivery within a county or groups ofcounties.Counter and Agency Services50        The Post. Office welcomes the Committee&apos;s support for thesystem of agency sub post  offices and  their view that:  the sizeof the network  is about right.     The network of sub offices  ismore extensive  (and the service to the customer correspondinglybetter)  than that in almost any other country.    The Post Officehas no intention of making major changes in the system or inthe size of the network although small adjustments will bemade as circumstances change.    Regarding the Committee&apos;srecommendation that  in certain circumstances compensation shouldbe paid to Sub-Postmasters on closure of offices,  this is anissue currently under negotiation with the National Federationof Sub-Postmasters.51        There has  recently been  some decline in counter businessas a result of the loss of National Insurance and Savingsstamps though this has been partially offset by new business,for example increased Giro transactions and British Visitors
passports.    As the Committee pointed out,  the Post OfficeAct  1969 restricts the types of business which Posts cancarry on.    It would be helpful in securing new agency work(and hence spreading the fixed costs of the counter network)if the restrictions could be lifted,  and the Post Office hopesthat early legislation to this end will be possible.52        The Postal Business is always locking for opportunitiesto improve the facilities and service provided at post officecounters.    A  &apos;single queue1  system is being introduced wherepracticable to minimize delay in serving customers at peakpressure periods,    Enquiry facilities are being improved asmentioned above.    Renewed efforts are being made to improvethe appearance of crown offices.    For the longer term a designstudy has been commissioned to examine the physical environmentand layout of counters.Letter Mochanisati on53        The Post Office welcomes the Committee&apos;s support -albeit qualified - of letter mechanisation.    The Committeeconsidered there was a case for a new comprehensive systems study.A detailed appraisal of the system was made in 1973 when allpracticable options were reviewed. The costings were updatedin &quot;early 1970 and the rate of return for the programme as awhole was predicted to be significantly in excess of theGovernment test discount rate.    The rate of return from theinvestment not yet completed is expected to be much greater.
Costings are updated annually,  and before mechanisationequipment is installed at a particular office there is fullproject appraisal and authorisation;  savings at mechanisedoffices are targeta,\    and monitored.    Against this backgroundthe Post Office is satisfied that the right course is to proceedwith the programme as speedily as possible rather than acceptthe inevitable doubt and delay that would result from a completefresh study.    This is not to say that the number and locationof offices is immutable and it could well be that future changesin technology or in the volume of business,etc,  could lead thePost Office to consider modification of the detailed aspectsof present plans.54        There are currently 18 offices handling letter mail bycode/sort machinery and a further 14 are either already equippedready for service or will be by early 1979.    While the aim isto complete the programme as early as possible,  any significantspeeding up on the planned completion date of 1982-83 is likelyto be constrained by the availability of buildings and skilledstaff resources.    As the programme develops,  the importance ofcustomer co-operation in using the   postcodes  will become evenmore important.    The Post Office intends to stimulate their useby increased publicity.
SECTION 4    GIRO55        The Post Office welcomes the Review Committee&apos;s endorsementof Giro and the important support   it gives   to the Post Officecounter service.    The Committee recognised the importance ofGiro developing into a full banking service and of its moneytransfer service becoming associated with a deposit facility.In April 1978 Giro introduced a deposit account service,  linkedwith the current account service,  on competitive terms.    It hasalso continued to widen the range of other services and hasintroduced this year a budget account service and bridgingloans for house purchase.56        Giro has been set stretching profit targets by theGovernment  (see para 10)  and has met them.    The competitivenessof its charges to businesses is demonstrated by continued rapidgrowth, with deposits into accounts of businesses reaching 10,000 million per annum by March 1978.    In fact,  in spite ofconstraints,  all round growth has continued and by the summerof 1978 Giro was handling over 250 million transactions perannum.    In its tenth year of operation Giro is moving forwardfrom the strong and flexible base already established.    ThePost Office intends it to continue to serve the public interestby providing at low real resource costs a relatively cheap,efficient and speedy money transfer service and by spreading thebanking habit to sectors of the population not yet acquaintedwith it.
