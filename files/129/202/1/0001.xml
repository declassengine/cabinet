RESTRICTEDDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCP(78)71 COPY NO3 July 1978CABINETTHE UNITED NATIONS SPECIAL SESSION ON DISARMAMENTNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs1. The United Nations Special Seosioaon Disarmament came to a close in NewYork in the early hour r. of 1 July.   The recultn are mixed. On the plus side, wehave secured a sensible package of reforms of the Conference of the Committeeon Disarmament, on the lines advocated in the Prime \finister&apos;s speech onthe Special Session on 2 June.    Our commitment to reaching agreement inour negotiations on a comprehensive test ban and force reductions in centralEurope has received general endorsement, and a number of signposts havebeen put up for further work in disarmament.    On the other hand, the FinalDocument of the Session is rather unbalanced, with some over-ambitiouslanguage on nuclear disarmament, and too little emphasis on non-proliferationand on the world-wide build-up of conventional arms.2. Britain has played a leading role among Western states in the Sessionand the preparations.    I think this is an occasion for a White Paper, toappear as soon as the Session is over.    After the introduction about the wayahead in disarmament, there would be a narrative section describing theBritish approach, the debate at the Session including the Prime Minister1 sspeech, the Final Document and the results.    Supporting documents wouldbe in annexes.3-        A draft is attached for the information of the Cabinet.    It is subjectto minor amendment when the Session ends.4- Since the annexes are very bulky and are already public, I am notattaching them, but they are available should any member of Cabinet wishto have them.DALOForeign and Commonwealth Office3 July 1978
WHITE PAPER ON THE UNITED NATIONSSPECIAL SESSION ON DISARMAMENTINTRODUCTIONThe Way Ahead in Disarmament&apos;       Britain has played a leading role in the negotiation of allmultilateral disarmament negotiations since the war.   There havebeen some useful achievements, notably the Partial Test Ban Treatyin 1963 and the Hon-Proliferation Treaty in 1968.We have also given high priority to the UN Special Sessionon Disarmament which has dust ended.   The Prime Minister made amajor speech there on 2 June.   We wanted the Session to be astimulus to progress towards success in existing negotiations andtowards starting new negotiations.Even if the concrete results of the Session are less thanwe had hoped, it has provided the opportunity for the widest everdiscussion of disarmament at a high level.   More and more statesare taking an interest and greater public attention has beenattracted to arms control.   These are significant results.There has also been a concrete achievement: a sensiblePackage of reforms to make the disarmament negotiating body inGeneva more effective and representative.   Britain played a centralrole in achieving agreement on this.Our task now is to work in all possible ways to implement^e ideas we put forward at the Special Session.   Our first and-ost immediate priority will be to achieve success in our tripartitenegotiations with the US and USSR on a Comprehensive Test BanT-eaty and to maintain and accelerate the momentum injected recentlyinto the MBFR talks in Vienna about force reductions.   Success intbese two negotiations would be a major achievement in arms controlfor detente.   As foreseen in the Prime Minister s speech at/the
the Special Session, Britain has put forward new proposals in thetest ban negotiations.   Agreement should be possible withinmonths.   A Comprehensive Test Ban would curb the development ofnuclear weapons and hinder their spread to more countries.   InMBFR, the Eastern response to the latest Western proposals hasbeen encouraging.   Following a British suggestion, the Westernparticipants will be ready, at the right moment, to raise thetalks to Ministerial level.Britain will also continue to support American efforts toachieve a second Strategic Arms Limitation agreement with theSoviet Union.   We hope that this will be followed urgently byfurther strategic arms negotiations resulting in significant cutsin stockpiles of delivery vehicles as well as controls on qualitativeimprovement *We shall also pursue our ideas for a ban on chemical weaponson which we tabled a draft convention in 1976; regional arrangementsto curb the international arms trade; and genuine, balancedreductions in the military budgets of as many States as possible.The United Kingdom will continue to participate actively inthe disarmament work of the United Nations and in the reformedCommittee on Disarmament in Geneva.   Our task will be to doeverything possible to achieve multilateral disarmament treaties,with full verification to enable all parties to have confidence incompliance by others.   Such agreements can maintain security atdecreasing levels of armaments, and so can free resources forother purposes including further aid for developing countries.They are stepping stones towards a safer world.
1*     The idea for a Special Session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly on disarmament goes back to 1961 when Non-Aliened Headsof Government, meeting in Belgrade, called for either a WorldDisarmament Conference or a Special Session.   The proposal wasrevived at the Colombo Summit of non-aligned countries in 1976,when it was suggested that the agenda should include a review ofdisarmament problems and a programme of priorities and recommendations,Qe* A     The UN General Assembly later adopted a resolution (31/189B -21 December 1976) calling for a Special Session in May-June 1978.The British Approach2.     The British approach was set out in full in the PrimeMinister&apos;s speech on 2 June 1978 at the Special Session.   Prom theoutset the United Kingdom believed that the purpose of the SpecialSession would be to give fresh impetus to negotiations ondisarmament and arms control, to allow all States to suggest waysof advancing these negotiations, and to make further disarmamentpossible by improving the international atmosphere.   The non-aligned countries, however, saw the Session as an opportunity toput pressure on the nuclear weapon States, including the UnitedKingdom, to make faster progress in disarmament talks - especiallythose on nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.3.     There was some concern that the Session might not be attendedby all major powers or that it might become the scene for polemicswhich would reduce, rather than achieve our objective of enhancing,the prospects for disarmament.   But Britain recognised the usefulpurposes that could be served by a large gathering.   Above all asense of urgency could be created by a Special Session.Consequently when the UK sent the Secretary-General its views onthe Session on 29 April 1977 it undertook to work for a successfuloutcome; the Session could improve disarmament prospects,particularly if international confidence were increased./Western
Annex C     4.     Despite differences that had begun to be seen between theapproaches of the various groups of States to the Special SessiLord Goronwy-Roberts, Minister of State for Foreign and Common^&apos;Annex D     Affairs, told the UN General Assembly on 3 November 1977 that $United Kingdom continued to hope that a Final Document could beproduced by consensus at the Special Session.   With 11 otherAnnex E     Western States, the UK put forward on 13 December 1977 a draftDeclaration on Disarmament of the sort which it hoped wouldprovide the first section of the Final Document.   It called fora comprehensive and integrated programme to achieve general andcomplete disarmament and the &quot;establishment of reliable procedu-&apos;for the peaceful settlement of disputes&quot;, as well as effectivearrangements &quot;for the maintenance of peace and security inaccordance with the principle of the UN Charter&quot;.   The draftthe principles which co-sponsors believed should govern thedisarmament negotiations.   These called for the participation 0&apos;all States, particularly all nuclear-weapon States, in thenegotiations and reaffirmed the necessity of conducting negoti on the basis of consensus.    They also stressed the importance cbalanced disarmament measures to ensure that no State or groupStates gained military advantage; such balanced disarmament coube achieved by graduated reduction of manpower and armaments tCagreed levels.    The importance of verification, includinginternational inspection and control, was also emphasised.Western Draft Programme of Action5-     Meanwhile the UK was taking the lead in preparing a Westedraft for the Programme of Action which would be the secondof the Final Document of the Special Session.   Dr David OwentForeign and Commonwealth Secretary, had concluded that theSpecial Session, although it had no powers to negotiate agreedcould be of real value in living a new impetus to progress indisarmament and drawing greater public attention to the subjeCThe Programme of Action, which was to lay down what should act&apos;/happenI
happen in disarmament after the Special Session, was the bestway of doing this.   It also offered the opportunity to get awayfrom the unplanned tackling of individual aspects of disarmamentin favour of a coordinated, systematic approach.   Dr Owen favoureda draft Programme both comprehensive and containing new ideas, butat the same time balanced and practicable.   He believed it shouldnot only set out priorities among existing negotiations but alsocall for specific new moves to promote disarmament.   After areview of British disarmament policy had been conducted in theForeign and Commonwealth Office, Dr Owen had a discussion of UKpolicy for the Special Session with a group of British non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on 14 December 1977-   On19 January 1978 he considered a first draft of the Programme ofAction, prepared in consultation with the Ministry of Defence, withthe FCO Disarmament Advisory Panel comprising distinguishedacademics, politicians and other independent experts in the field.The draft was also discussed at meetings of the Nine EEC countriesand of NATO, and in a wider circle of Western States at the UnitedNations.   After the draft had been revised and improved Britainput it forward, with nine other Western States as co-sponsors, on1 February 1978 in the Preparatory Committee.6.     The Draft Programme called for &quot;a sustained effort to eliminatethe sources of tension and injustice in the world&quot; and to improvethe UN machinery for the peaceful settlement of disputes.   Itoutlined immediate measures for negotiation, including furtherSALT agreements to halt and reverse the nuclear arms race, acomprehensive test ban on nuclear explosions in all environments,a range of measures to help prevent the spread of nuclear weapons,the banning of chemical weapons, and various agreements to limitconventional armaments.   In a point which was to play a significantrole at the Special Session, the Programme called on nuclear powersto give assurances which would enhance the confidence of non-nuclearstates in their security from nuclear attach.7.     The Programme placed great emphasis on furfcfcer measures tostrengthen international confidence.   It called on States to/publish
publish more information about their military production andarmed forces, ar.d to facilitate disarmament agreements byaccepting adequate control provisions.     The draft called forStates to supply full information on their military budgets, usingthe system devised by the Secretary-General1s group of experts forstandardised measurement and reporting, in order to provide a firmbasis for an international agreement on balanced and verifiedreductions in military expenditure.     The draft made the newsuggestion that confidence could be increased if other Statesas   *ell as   those in Europe informed their neighbours beforeholding military manoeuvres and invited them to send observers.It called for improved &quot;hot line&quot; communications between governmentsparticularly in areas   of tension.3.    In a final section, the draft listed studies which theoecretary-General might carry out on strengthening the UN&apos;s rolein peacekeeping and the peaceful settlement of disputes; therelationship between disarmament and economic development; regionaldisarmament measures; and how modern means of surveillance couldbe used in enhancing confidence or verifying arms control agreementsA particularly important proposal included in the draft was for aUN study on the world-wide build up of conventional arms.     Non-aligned resistance to restrictions on the arms trade had twicefrustrated this proposal.     Bub Britain hoped the Special Sessionwould be the occasion when this increasingly important subjectwould at last be tackled.East European Papers9.    Seven East European countries, offering viev/s on the FinalDocument in two papers tabled in September 1977, criticised&quot;the actions of   the enemies of detente and disarmament&quot; who theyclaimed were encouraging the arms race.     They suggested thatagreements such as the Non-Pro1iferation Treaty and the BiologicalWeapons Convention &quot;provide tangible proof that it is possible tosolve the problem of disarmament&quot;.     The papers said that militarydetente was essential to &quot;buttress&quot; the current relaxation ofinternational tensions, and called for prohibition of chemicalweapons and new weapons of mass destruction, limitation andreduction of conventional forces, reduction of military budgetsand regional measures of military detente and disarmament.
10.     Though differing in their emphasis on particular agreements,both the Western and East European groups therefore looked forward&quot;to the successful completion of current disarmament negotiations.The Western paper outlined a more comprehensive approach for buildingconfidence and reducing tensions, which it saw as the fundamentalcause of the increase in armaments.    The Eastern paper blamed thisincrease on the &quot;enemies of detente&quot; and the &quot;military-industrialcomplex.Non-Aliened Papers11.    The non-aligned States took a different approach in theirpaper of 24 January 1978, concentrating on nuclear disarmament andagain claiming that &quot;the security of all nations cannot be maintainedon the precarious basis of mutual deterrence&quot;.    They called forrenunciation of the first use of nuclear weapons;    reduction ofstockpiles of nuclear weapons and curbs on more sophisticated nuclearweapons and delivery systems.    Measures of conventional disarmamentcame last among their ideas although they urged a ban on thedevelopment and production of new types of conventional weaponsand the limitation and reduction of conventional weapons on aglobal basis.    The non-aligned movements suggested confidence-building measures contrasted markedly v/ith those in the Westernpaper, including the withdrawal of troops from foreign countriesand the dismantling of military bases overseas.12.     The non-aligned also proposed reforms in the internationaldisarmament forums - to be the subject of the third section of theFinal Document,    They suggested that the UN General Assembly^First Committee should deal only with disarmament and internationalsecurity and that an &quot;organic link&quot; should be established betweenthe General Assembly and the Conference of the Committee onx       disarmament (CCD) in Geneva - the main disarmament negotiating body,All States, they suggested, should be able to submit proposals to theCCD and attend its sessions to hear them being discussed, and theCCDfs presiding chairman should change each month.  (The. system atthe time was that chairmen rotated after each meeting;    the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union were the permanent co-chairmen of theCCD with the function of business managers).Western Paper on MachineryA paper on international machinery for disarmament, tabledon 15 February 1978 by the UK and six other Western States, also/proposed
proposed that the UNGA First Committee should deal only withdisarmament questions.    It suggested that the CCD &quot;should continueto exercise its functions as the principal multilateral negotiatir-body&quot; but that it might be improved by a limited increase in itsmembership, arrangements for non-members to attend plenary meetingfand a closer association between the Committee and the UN.    Thisreflected the British view that the CCD had done useful work andthat its core should be preserved while its structure should beimproved.    The Western paper also suggested that the Centre forDisarmament in the UN Secretariat should be strengthened to helpprepare reports and studies, to produce information related totopical questions and to increase contacts with non-governmentalorganisations and research institutes.The Preparatory Committee14.    The Preparatory Committee of 54 States including the UK hadmet three times in 1977 to agree on organisational matters.    Thetask of trying to agree on the Final Document of the Session beganat the Committee^ fourth meeting from 24 January - 24 February1978 and continued at the fifth meeting from 4 - 21 April.15.    The non-aligned countries insisted that their wording shouldbe used almost exclusively in the &quot;review and appraisal&quot; sections cthe Final Document.    This emphasised the dangers of the arms racev/hich &quot;both reflects and aggravates international tensions,sharpens conflicts in various regions of the world, hinders theprocess of detente, exacerbates the differences between opposingmilitary alliances,  jeopardises the security of all States andincreases the threat of nuclear war&quot;.    The non-aligned claimed th3*&quot;no real progress has been made so far in the crucial field of thereduction of armaments&quot; and that attention should revert to gener^and complete disarmament.16.    In the section on &quot;goals and priorities&quot;, the non-alignedsought to give overwhelming emphasis to nuclear disarmament;    theWest rn and East European groups wanted a balance between nuclearand conventional disarmament.    The West also opposed the non-alignedemand that the section on &quot;principles of disarmament&quot; shoulddeclare the use of nuclear weapons to be &quot;indefensible under anycircumstances&quot;, arguing that this would undermine the doctrine ofnuclear deterrence of aggression, which had helped to keep thepeace in Europe for 30 years.   Equally,  the non-aligned formulau/that
that the presence of troops on foreign territory was &quot;a permanentthreat to the establishment of genuine and effective nationaland regional security&apos;1 clashed with the Western view that defensivealliances such as NATO could help maintain security and reducearmaments by avoiding the need for each country to provide alonefor its own defence.17.    Some progress was made, howev r, in the Programme of Actionsection.    Wording was agreed on a call for a second Strategic ArmsLimitation agreement between the US and the Soviet Union and. aprompt start to further SALT negotiations.    Wide agreement was alsoreached on language calling for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treatyand on the desirability of establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones,on conventional weapons and on the relationship between disarmamentand development.    Disagreements remained over many other subjects,notably further nuclear disarmament measures and steps to outlawthe use of nuclear weapons.18.    Little progress was made by the Preparatory Committee onthe machinery section of the Final Document.    Some States, notablyFrance, suggested that the CCD should be replaced by another forumas the main disarmament negotiating body;    others (including otherWestern countries) called for reforms in its organisation;    whilea third view (held by the East Europeans) was that the CCD shouldbe preserved without change.    The Western States saw the UNGA FirstCommittee as the best discussion forum on disarmament;    othersenvisaged a new body, or the reconvening of the UN DisarmamentCommission which had not met for over a decade.Non-Governmental Organisations19.    It was proposed at the Preparatory Committee1s first meetingthat independent non-governmental organisations (NGOs) should beallowed to participate in the Special Session so that world publicopinion could add its voice to that of political leaders.    Afterinitial resistance to the proposal from the East European countries,the Committee agreed on 9 May 1977 that NGO representatives couldbe present at its meetings; and that,  to make the NGO contributionsmore widely known,  the Secretariat would circulate the communicationsreceived from the organisations and institutions know to beconducting disarmament research.   At Britain^ suggestion, thePreparatory Committee subsequently recommended that NGOs should/receive
receive the same facilities at the Special Session itself, thusenabling them to attend and put forward documents for the attentionof governmental delegates.20.    During the fourth meeting of the Preparatory Committee theUK proposed that the NGOs and institutes concerned with disarmamentshould in addition be able to address the Special Session on a dayreserved for this purpose.    The idea received widespread support,though the East European countries were reluctant to acceptthe inclusion of research institutes.    On 20 April 1978 the Committeeaccepted a recommendation that 12 June should be set aside for NGOs.ex 0   with a maximum of 25 speakers.    It was agreed that the StockholmInternational Peace Research Institute (SIPRl) and five institutesfrom other countries should be invited to speak on 13 June.21.    A suggestion by British NGOs that the UK Delegation to theSpecial Session should include an NGO representative was welcomed byDr Owen.    His invitation to Lord Noel-Baker, veteran of the 1932World Disarmament Conference and holder of the Nobel Peace Prize,to join the UK Delegation as an adviser was widely greeted by theNGOs at a second seminar in the Foreign and Commonwealth Officeon 12 April 1978.The General Debate  &apos;22.    The General Debate of the Special Session lasted from 23 May to9 June.    It provided an opportunity, unique in the history of armscontrol for a worldwide exchange of views at a senior level.    Of 126nex J speakers, 20 were heads of state or government (mostly from NATO andthe European neutrals) and 51 were foreign ministers. The Presidentof Prance appeared at the UK for the first time.    The Danishnex K   Minister Without Portfolio made a statement on behalf of the EuropeaIJCommunity.nex M The British Prime Minister, Mr Callaghan,  speaking on 2 June,reaffirmed that the United Kingdom was willing to play a centralrole in the search for disarmament.    Britain1s policy was to proceedstep by step, but activities in various fields should henceforth becoordinated.    He said:    &quot;^he building blocks should be each put inplace so that they fit together,  strengthen each other, and providea new base for further coordinated advance.    If^ in this SpecialSession, v/e can provide a clear framework on which to build, we sha^accelerate the rate of construction&quot;.    He advocated an early X jjcomprehensive nuclear&quot; test ban and said that Britain would be puttingI/forward
forward new proposals to advance agreement.    He called for furtherstrategic arms limitation agreements, and spoke of limitingnuclear weapons of shorter range now targeted on Europe.    He pledgedUK support for &quot;firm, far-reaching and permanent assurances&quot; tonon-nuclear weapon States and for further nuclear-weapon free zones.He urged all countries to accept IAEA safeguards on their peacefulnuclear activities.    He told the Session that the NATO Summit hadaccepted Britain1s suggestion that Foreign Ministers should meetto give political impetus to the MBFR negotiations in Europe.Mr Callaghan emphasised the importance of restraint in the use ofexisting arms and of confidence building measures to reducesuspicions of other countries1 intentions.    Stressing the role ofverification in disarmament, he pledged that Britain would accepton its territory whatever further measures of verification, includinginternational inspection, were needed to underpin future arms controlagreements.    He called for a complete ban on chemical weapons, whichBritain had already renounced.    He urged the UN to consider ways ofrestricting the build-up of conventional arms, and proposed as afirst step that the Session should launch a UN study of the problem.He supported the Nordic proposal for a study of the relationshipbetween disarmament and development, and attached particularimportance to work on the problem of converting arms productionfacilities to civil purposes.   He called for all countries tocooperate in implementing the system for measuring and reportingmilitary budgets which had been developed under the auspices ofthe Secretary-General, pointing out that this would &quot;provide a fairand firm basis of knowledge and confidence which would make iteasier to reach agreements to reduce our expenditures&quot;.    He proposedfurther UN work on peacekeeping, adding that the idea of standingnational commitments to render help was an invaluable aid to planning.He advocated the reform of the CCD so that France and China couldPlay their full roles, and called for the UN Disarmament Centre tobecome a repository for data on disarmament.    He stressed theadvantages of a short-term Programme of Action leading to a secondSpecial Bession in three years1 time to assess progress and makefurther plans.24. The content of the speeches in the debate - about 25 summarisedin an annex - was mostly constructive and optimistic. Determinationto make progress was the general theme.    A number of new ideas were/put
put forward.    There were relatively few polemical notes, despitesome airing of disputes, including regional ones, and considerablenon-aligned criticism of the developed states for not moving fastenough in nuclear disarmament.    This last theme was an indicationthat the drafting of an agreed Final Document for the Session wouldbe a difficult process.25.    One notable point was that Vice-President Mondale and Mr Gromykoboth spoke of significant reductions in stockpiles and constraints oflqualitative improvement as objectives for the next round of strategicarras negotiations.    Other major themes in the debate were theimportance of nuclear disarmament,  especially SALT, a comprehensivetest ban and nuclear weapon free zones;    the view that disarmamentcould release resources for economic development;    the need, stressedby the Western States,  to tackle the problem of the arms trade;the importance of the peacekeeping role of the UN;    the proposal thatthe nuclear powers should give appropriate &quot;negative securityassurances&quot; that they would not use nuclear weapons against Stateswhich had renounced them;    and the need to improve the structure ofthe CCD.26.    New ideas, in addition to those in Mr Callaghan s sp :ech,included the following.    The UN Secretary-General suggested anAdvisory Board to help guide the research activities of the Disarms^Centre in the UN Secretariat, and that States should devote 0.01their military spending to disarmament work.    President GiscarddfEstaing put forward five ideas which featured in the new Frenchapproach to disarmament, including the replacement of the CCD, theestablishment of an international satellite monitoring agency, andthe calling of a European Disarmament Conference.    The NetherlandsForeign Minister suggested an International Disarmament OrganisationMr Trudeau, like several other speakers,  suggested the verifiedcessation of the production of fissionable material for nuclearweapons purposes.    He also suggested a halt in the flight testingof nuclear delivery vehicles and limits on expenditure on nuclearweapons.    Mr Gromyko called for discussions between all nuclearpowers and some others on stopping the production of nuclear weapofl&quot;and on other subjects.    He suggested that the placing of nuclearweapons in additional states should be banned.    Vice-PresidentMondale suggested the creation of a peacekeeping reserve for the U^1Chancellor Schmidttproposed a world-wide convention on confidence^/building
building measures.     Mr Desai called on behalf of India for gradualreduction of nuclear stockpiles with a view to their totalelimination within a matter of years.Preparing the Final Document27.   At the start of the Session Lord Goronwy-Roberts held meetingswith the leaders of some important delegations.     There was basicagreement that the Special Session should result in practicalachievements rather than vague aspirations, although at thatstage tnere was no general opinion on a Final Document or onreforms of disarmament machinery.     When the Prime Minister andDr Owen were at the Session on 2 June the situation remained   open.A pattern of drafting groups got down to business on 5 June.     TheBritish Delegation made a particular effort to produce acceptablewording for the nuclear sections of the Programme of Action;although these texts met with fairly wide support they did notachieve general approval.p   28.    On reforms to disarmament machinery, Britain put forwardproposals on 16 June which were based on the Prime Ministersspeech of 2 June.     These called in particular for the removalof the US - Soviet co-Chairmanship, which had long been wantedby the non-aligned countries and was a condition of French andChinese participation in the negotiating body.     On 29 June theQ   British delegation followed up the reference in the Prime Minister&apos;sspeech to the security of non-nuclear weapon States against nuclearattack by giving a negative security assurance to such States whichare parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty or other internationallybinding commitments not to manufacture or acquire nuclear explosivedevices.jfoe Final Document29.   The Session succeeded, after long consultations, in agreeingon a Final Document, which was adopted by consensus after the-ession had been extended until 30 June.     The document, asexpected, was in three parts:    a Declaration, a Programme ofaction and a section on the international machinery dealing withdisarmament.
30.    The Declaration contains some useful points.       It statesthat zhe ultimate objective in the disarmament process isgeneral and complete disarmament under effective internationalcontrol.     As priorities, it lists effective measures of nucleardisarmament and the prevention of nuclear war; prohibition ofother weapons of mass destruction; and balanced reduction ofarmed forces and conventional armaments.     A section onprinciples to govern negotiations says that the objective ateach stage of disarmament should be undiminished security atthe lowest possible level of armaments and military forces.The need for adequate measures of verification is stressed.States are called upon to abide by the UN Charter and refrainfrom actions which might adversely affect disarmament efforts.31.    Taken as a whole, however, the Declaration suffers froma lack of balance through insufficient emphasis on measuresto limit conventional v/eapons and on the need to prevent thespread of nuclear weapons.32.    The Programme of Action sets out measures needed indisarmament in &quot;the next few years&quot;.     The sections on nuclearmatters set the ultimate goal of the complete elimination ofnuclear weapons.     Various measures are listed which couldform part of this process.     There are positive sections onthe need for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and furtheragreements on strategic arms limitation.     Nuclear weaponstates are called unon to give negative security assurances,such as the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain gaveduring the Session.     The section on non-proliferation ofnuclear weapons starts with a statement of the need for action.But zhe subsequent reference to the Non-Proliferation Treaty isgru^ng and the list of measures needed is much shorter than thee in the Western draft for the Programme of Action.     Thesection on other weapons of mrss destruction gives properemphasis to a ban on chemical weapons.     Curbs on conventionalweapons receive less   attention than nuclear measures.     Thereis encouragement for. the efforts being made in the Vienna/negotiations
negotiations on Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions in Europe.The brief and rather qualified reference to consultations onlimiting transfers of conventional weapons if far less positivethan Britain wanted.     The passage on reduction of militarybudgets is also general and, unlike the Western draft Programmeof Action, does not call for the testing of a means of comparingbudgets so that actual reductions can be planned.     Whereasthe Western draft Programme advocated a range of confidence-building measures, the Final Document is much less specific.Its only concrete suggestion is the idea, advanced by theUnited Kingdom in the preparations for the Special Session, ofusing &quot;hot lines&quot;, and other methods of reducing the risk ofconflict, in areas of tension.33.   Although a number of interesting proposals for studies bythe United Nations on aspects of disarmament were put forwardduring the preparations for the Special Session, the Soviet Unionopposed decisions on such studies during the Session.     Theearlier decision to hold a UN study on the relationship betweendisarmament and development was confirmed.     But other proposalswere not mentioned in the Final Document.     It was particularlydisappointing that certain non-aligned states maintained at theSpecial Session their opposition to a UN study on the world-widebuild-up of conventional arms, which Britain had seen as a firststep towards concrete agreements on the subject.The third section of the Final Document - about internationalmachinery for disarmament - contained the most significant concreteresult of the Special Session.       Britain played a central rolosecuring agreement on a package of reforms to make the Conferenceof the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva more representative.A way Was found of reconciling the French desire for a new bodywith Soviet preference for very limited change.     As proposedin the Prime Minister^ speech on 2 June, the co-chairmanship ofthe CCD was abolished and the CCD was brought closer to theUnited Nations without endangering its practice of takingdecisions by consensus.     France agreed to participate in thenew Committee on Disarmament.     Provision was made for China   to/join
join end Tor five additional members to be selected after theSpecial Session,      The same section of the Final Document saidthat the date of a furtner Special Session should be decidedby the next regular session of the General Assembly.-    r-aisal35*    The Special Session produced some good results.      Itprovided the occasion for the widest ever internationaldiscussion of disarmament at a high level.     It was significantthat all states were able to agree on a Final Document expressingfor the first time the views of the v/hole world on disarmament.It was also   valuable that the Session encouraged more statesto take an active interest in disarmament and attracted greaterpublic attention to the subject.     The agreement to reform theCCD was a worthwhile step forward.36.   At the same time it was regrettable that certain goodideas were left out of the Final Document, which paid lessattention than Britain wanted to some important subjects,especially nuclear non-proliferation and international armstransfers.37-    Despite these disappointments, the Session served auseful purpose.     States must now show their determination tomake concrete progress in arms control negotiations.
