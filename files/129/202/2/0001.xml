DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCP(78) 72COPY NO7 July 1978CABINETWHITE PAPER ON OVERSEAS   REPRESENTATIONNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign andCommonwealth Affairs1. I attach the latest draft of the White Paper and Annex on this subject.2. A Ministerial Group (GEN 89) considered an earlier draft of theWhite Paper and Annex under the Chancellor of the Exchequer1 s chairmanshipon 4 July.    The Group also had before them caxnmftntB from the Secretariesof State for Energy, Education and Science, Industry and Employment.Other members of the Cabinet who have an interest in the subject and are notrepresented on GEN 89 saw the drafts, but offerad no comment.3, GEN 89 was able to reach agreement on all the remaining issues to becovered in the White Paper, eg on interchange;  defence work;  and aidadministration.   We also agreed to accept most of the proposals of theSecretary of State for Energy (except on information and the BBC), theSecretary of State for Education and Science, and the Secretary of State forEmployment;  and I have added a passage on invisible exports which has beenAgreed by the Department of Trade.    On immigration, the Home Secretaryhas agreed to the text of replies to those Central Policy Review Staffrecommendations on control of entry (Chapter 10) not covered in the separateWhite Paper which will constitute the main reply to the Select Committee onRace Relations and Immigration.4. It was agreed at GEN 89 that final decisions on the two majoroutstanding issues - the role of the British Council and the BBC vernacularservices - need not hold up publication of the White Paper, but could betackled on a longer time scale.5. Those minor points which were not completely resolved around thetable at GEN 89 have since been cleared up at official level and are includedin the present draft, which I think can now be said to reflect a consensus.GEN 89 concluded that it would be desirable to publish the White Paperbefore the Recess, and I hope we can keep to this timetable.D A L OForeign and Commonwealth Office7 July 1978
July 1978DRAFT WHITE PAPERTHE UNITED KINGDOM1S OVERSEAS REPRESENTATIONI.     THE CHANGING PATTERN OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS1-     Since 1945 international relations have undergone changeson a scale as great as in any comparable period in our history.Britain, like other nations, has seen a profound and rapid changein the nature of international society - and her place in thatsociety.    In consequence, our national objectives overseas andthe way in which we try to secure them have been a subject ofalmost continuous debate in the post-war era.2.     Compared with today, the international issues of thirty yearsago have the appearance of a relative and brutal simplicity.   TheUnited Nations, established in 1945* had a mere  51 members.Decolonization had only just begun, with Britain1s grant ofindependence to India and Pakistan in 1947.   Military power wasoverwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of the United States, andto a lesser degree in those of the Soviet Union.    The Cold Warand the polarization of East and West in Europe, reflected in theSoviet take-over of Czechoslovakia and pressures on Berlin,generated tensions which could have triggered a third world war.3.     Over the last thirty years the basic indicators of changenave moved dramatically.    In 1947 there were 57 members of the UN;in 1957, 82;    in 1967, 123;    and in 1977, 149.    Decolonization andthe proliferation of newly independent states have brought in theirwake a progressive diffusion of political, economic and militarypower.    The paradox of the post-war world is that this processcoincided with the emergence of the concept of the superpower./With
With every year that has passed the military strength of the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union has grown, absolutely and relatively,^nd has made them qualitatively different from the rest of theworld community.4.     Yet the superpowers frequently, and possibly increasingly,find themselves unable to convert their overwhelming militarystrength into lasting political influence at the regional level.Many of the problems of the post-war world - the Kiddle East,Cyprus, Southern Africa - remain unresolved.   Moreover, the 150or so states of the world have the capacity, individually or ingroups, to take decisions and to form their own poles of regionalinfluence, regardless of the wishes of the superpowers.  Theability of medium-sized Western European nations like Britain ontheir own to influence world events may be today highly circumscribed,and diminishing.    But it is equally true that even the greatestpowers cannot shape international relations at will.5.     Particularly in the economic field, what each country does athome can affect the prosperity of all the others.   After the GreatDepression of the 1930s and its culmination in the Second World War,the industrialised democracies set about substituting a system oforderly negotiation and management for what had come to seem anincreasingly self-defeating law of the Jungle.    This led to thecreation of the world financial, economic and trading system basedon the International Monetary Fund (W), the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development (established as the Organisationfor European Economic Cooperation in 19^7), and the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade (1948).6*     A generation later the oil embargo imposed by most of thePetroleum producing states, and the oil and commodity price rises0;f 1973 and 1974, exacerbated inflation in the industrialisedcountries and helped bring about a world-wide recession which hasoeen as damaging to oil and other commodity producers as to everyoneelse;    and which is still with us.   The reciprocal damage which thisnas done to the economies of the developed and developing countries,/and
and the pealisation on both sides that prosperity is a two-way street,have added further importance to what is nov commonly known as theNorth-South Dialogue.    This dialogue is essentially about thetransfer of resources, by one means or another, to the developingworld within the framework of an international economic systemrestructured to give greater weight to the poorer nations.   This hasnow led to a series of virtually permanent negotiations both inad hoc meetings (such as the Paris Conference on InternationalEconomic Cooperation in 1977) and permanent institutions (suchas the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development andother United Nations Agencies).7.     In addition, the depth and persistence of the world recessionwhich began in 1974, and the increasing strain which this has placedon relations amongst the industrialised democracies themselves, havegiven rise to what is virtually a third stage in the continuingeffort to reach agreement about the working of the world economy,namely a series of economic summit meetings between some of theindustrialised democracies - at Rambouillet in 1975, Puerto Ricoin 1976, London in 1977, Bonn in 1978.8-     Taken together, these developments over the past thirty yearsnave meant that the management of national economies has becomeincreasingly an area of international, as well as domestic, decision-making.    In Britain, as in other countries, the Government&apos;seconomic decisions cannot ignore international commitments and theattitudes of other powers.9.     As a result of these developments, there has been a growth ofregional groupings, fouided  in the belief that unified action andPooled resources can more effectively promote the prosperity andsecurity of all concerned than if each country were to go its ownWay.   The European Community is the most sophisticated and highlyinstitutionalised of these groupings.   In Eastern Europe, there istne Council for Mutual Economic Assistance.    In Africa, there are-he Organisation of African Unity and a nunber of smaller groupingsof African states;    in America, the Organisation of American States/and
and the Latin American Economic System, among others;    inSouth-East Asia, the Association of South-East Asian Nations.10.     These organisations are for the most part politico-economicir. purpose.    But in the last thirty years there has also been aconstant need for systems of collective security as well as ofcollective prosperity.    The North Atlantic Treaty Organisationexists because Britain, and other Western European states, nolonger have the capacity to defend themselves on their own.   Onlya collective effort made with the United States within the AtlanticAlliance can provide security against the Warsaw Pact, the alliancewhich binds most of the countries of Eastern Europe to the SovietUnion.    In the meetings of the Conference on Security and Cooperationin Europe - in Helsinki in 1975, and in Belgrade in 1977-78 -member countries of the Atlantic Alliance and of the Warsaw Pactrespectively coordinated their policies.    This is also true cf thetalks on force reductions in central Europe currently being heldin Vienna, and in general of all international discussions ofdisarmament, both conventional and nuclear, where the nations ofEast and West are represented.il.     Traditionally, a nation1s freedom of action has been limitedb7 its own strength, by that of its neighbours, friendly or hostile,and by any commitments flowing from membership of defensive alliances.All these factors continue to be relevant in the modern world.    Butabove all the freedom of initiative of independent states isincreasingly subject to economic constraints of a new type.    Some-times these constraints are imposed by external forces, as in theCase of developing nations dependent on the export of a singlecommodity, and thus at the mercy of fluctuations in world prices;sometimes they are voluntarily assumed, as in the case of theEuropean Community, where the member states, including Britain,nave taken a conscious decision to fuse a assure of specificnational interest in the pursuit of a wider common interest./IP.4
12.     The main features to emerge in the past thirty years aretherefore:- a progressive diffusion of political, economic andmilitary power outside the two superpowers and Europe;- the dramatically increased and still increasing importanceof an ever-widening complex of international economicissues, all of them linked;- the widespread recognition within the internationalcommunity that the world economy is a single entitywithin which national economies cannot be properlymanaged unless there is some harmonisation of decision-making in international bodies;- a corresponding proliferation of international organ-isations, most of them concerned with the managementof various aspects of international economic relations;the consequent impact of economic issues on the formu-lation of foreign policy and of multilateral diplomacyon its execution;- the growth of regional groupings, formal and informal,reflecting the realisation that in an interdependentwojfcld no nation can guarantee its security and prosperitysolely from its own resources.^-3.     None of this means that we are on the verge of either afederal Europe or world government.    But an historical processbas begun which may prove in the long run as significant for theorganisation of human society, and the management of its prosperity,as that which gave birth to the secular and sovereign nationstate itself in 15th and 16th century Europe.5
II     BRITAIN1G PLACE IN THE WORLD14.   If the world has changed, so has Britain&apos;s place in it.Britain&apos;s supremacy as an industrial and maritime power passedits peak over a century ago.    But the change   in our internationalPosition has been most conspicuous since 1945-    In 1948 Britainhas 12% of world trade and was the second most important tradingnation.    In 1977 our share of world trade had fallen to around5% and we had slipped to fifth place in the international leaguetable.    Even in 1958 our total gross domestic product was thesecond biggest of the world market economies.    In 1976 it wasthe fifth largest, while between 1958 and 1976 Britain&apos;s GDP perhead had fallen from about 12th to about 24th.15.     These figures need to be kept in proportion.   The Germanand Japanese economies were devastated by war.    They were bound todevelop again into major economic competitors, as they had beenbefore the war.   Also, as the Empire changed into   a   Commonwealthof independent nations, Britain&apos;s preferential access to the formercolonies was progressively eroded.   We no longer had protectedmarkets for our goods.   We had to sell against increasingly sophis-ticated competitors and gorwing local industries.    But having dis-ttantled the Empire - a few residual commitments excepted;   havingwithdrawn from east of Suez;    and having finished the transitionalPeriod for entry into the European Community, Britain can now besaid to have completed the process of post-war adjustment and canlook forward to the challenges of developing a different pattern ofoverseas relations.^.   In these changed circumstances, Britain continues to make asubstantial contribution to international affairs.   We are a leadingMember of NATO, spending a larger proportion of our national^sources than any of our European Allies on defence, and the onlySurcpBan state to contribute to the Alliance&apos;s conventional,strategic, and tactical nuclear forces.   We hold a permanent seat/the
the UN Security Council.   We play a major part in all the maininternational financial and economic institutions like theInternational Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the OECD.   As afounder member of the Commonwealth we have easy and informal linesof communication to 35 diverse and far-flung states at almost everystage of economic development.   The Commonwealth gives us a uniqueinsight - of which we must make the gnatest possible use - intothe preoccupations of the developing world, enabling the UnitedKingdom to make a more effective contribution to the dialogue withthe developing nations.   We also have residual colonial commitments,notably ir Rhodesia, the Caribbean, the South Atlantic, Gibraltar,Hong Kong and the Pacific.   More generally, in our relations withall countries we start with the inestimable advantage of havingestablished in the intellectual sphere - the arts, literatureand science - a leading position which is all the stronger becauseit is so often expressed through what is now the principal inter-national language.17.   Our ability to exercise influence in the word - especially inthe uncommitted Third World - also depends on maintaining asubstantial and wellrdirected flow of development assistancecommensurate with or economic strength.   We are still the thirdlargest contributor to IBRD and IDA and the sixth largest donorin the industrialised world of all forms of aid.    The primaryPurpose of our aid is, and must continue to be, to promote sounddevelopment and to direct the bulk of our assistance to thosewho need it most, the poorest countries and the poorest people.But within this overall strategy our aid programme reinforcesour wider political and economic objectives.    The two-way flowof people under our technical cooperation programmes strengthens0nr links with overseas countries and projects a positive imageof Britain.    The capital aid we provide creates jcte in Britain aswell as development abroad.    So long as we are seen to be takingour fair share of the burden of aiding the Third World we shallnave an effective voice in the international dialogue, the successQf which is vital not merely to sustaining economic growth but to/preserving7
8preserving world peace.18.    In as far as the Second World War resulted in the overshadowingof Europe by the superpowers, and developments since then have ledto a diffusion of power outside Europe, the decline in strength whichBritain has experienced has been due to factors applying equallyto all the countries of Europe.   Nor were we alone in having todismantle a colonial Empire.   Although.our economic performance hasbeen relatively less effective than that of some of our partners inEurope of similar size and potential strength to ours, there is noinherent reason why this should be a lasting state of affairs.    In1973 we became a member of the European Community, a unique inter-national association of 250 million people which is becomingincreasingly influential in its own right in international affairs;and one channel through which Britain&apos;s voice is heard in virtuallyall international economic discussions:    on tariffs and tradingagreements in the Multilateral Trade Negotiations;    on the priceand supply of commodities and raw materials and all the other issueshovered in negotiations with the developing nations;    on theprevention of market disruption and unemployment in our countrycaused by surges of ultra-competitive imports.    On political issuesas well, the member countries of the Community are becomingincreasingly accustaed to speaking and acting as one, as theircooperation throughout the six years of successive meetings of theConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe underlined.19. Whether *-Britain1 s economic performance is to continue todecline relative to that of France and Germany remains largely inour own hands.    There is certainly some lost ground which coild bemade up.    By the 1980s we shall be the only member of the EuropeanCommunity to be self-sufficient in the increasingly scaroe andexpensive commodity of energy.    The challenge is to use effectively,efficiently and economically the benefits of North Sea oil so thatwe can re-invest in our industrial base and so help remedy thedeep-seated structural problems of British industry.   Politically,too, the position which we occupy in the principal areas of inter-national affairs gives us a more than adequate springboard for animaginative and effective foreign policy, and our resources cansupport the system of overseas representation which such a foreignPolicy entails./Ill
III     THE PATTERN OF FUTURE CHANGE20 .   Prediction is dangerous, but trends stemming from the presentPattern of international relations are discernible.   Enlargementof the European Community to twelve is inevitable, and it may wellexpand even further.   But the strains to which we can expect theEuropean Community to be subjected by enlargement;    by economicProblems;   by the inevitability of continuing argument about thePace and nature of integration;    and, possibly, by politicalinstability in one or more of the member states, will be more thanbalanced by the clear advantages of membership of a powerful andcohesive politico-economic grouping at a time of general economicturbulence.21.   United Nations membership is approaching its ceiling.    It islikely to intensify its activities in international peace-keeping,disarmament and arms control.   Economic and social issues willincreasingly occupy the Organisation&apos;s attention.   The Commonwealthshould gain some new member states, but is unlikely to changefundamentally its method of working and consultative procedures.The problems of the world economy will continue to dominateinternational relations and are unlikely to become less acute:   inthe shorter term, if the world relapses further into recession andProtectionism;    in the longer term, if a greater measure ofinternational agreement is not reached on the knot of problemscovered by the North-South Dialogue;    or if there is, as seemsiifcely, an acute energy shortage later in the century.   ThePre-eminence of economic issues will almost certainly lead to a^strengthening of the multilateral system in international relations*nd to a continuation of the process, by now well-established, ofAshing the economic with the political, the domestic with theexternal. ?.   In the last quarter of the 20th century threats to internationalsecurity   re likely to increase rather than to diminish.   The veryintractability of international economic problems may generateserious tensions in the Third World.   This, allied to the continuingProliferation of military power, reflected in massive conventionalarms transfers, could seriously threaten regional and possibly/v:orld9
world security.   The danger to world peace would become particularlyacute if this proliferation acquired a nuclear dimension.23 .   The future pattern of East-West relations is difficult toforesee, depending as it does on many factors beyond the controlof East and West.   Major unknown quantities are the pace at whichChina will emerge to challenge the position of the two superpowers,and how the United States and the Soviet Union will react to theUkeiy increase in tension and instability in the Third World.Until now, detente1 s achievements have been largely confined tothe strategic relationship between the Americans and the Russians,and to Europe.   The United States has not so far been able to achievea basis for&quot; accommodation with the Soviet Union outside Europe.   InAfrica, since the Cuban involvement in Angola in 1975, the world haswitnessed the use of surrogate forces by the Soviet Union.   Theexercise of power by proxy has been a constant feature of Sovietinfluence in Europe;   but the ability to deploy the military forcesof Cuba - a nominally non-aligned country - in the continent ofAfrica, and possibly elsewhere, reveals a new weapon at the disposalof Soviet foreign policy.2^   These uncertainties are compounded by the changes in the Sovietleadership which will inevitably take place before long.   We mustdemonstrate by deeds as well as words our belief that the benefits^ all sides of continuing detente are so self-evident that we willaH be ready to place our rivalries within the framework of anorderly and manageable international dialogue.   Britain and heraHies, for their part, must plan ahead on the basis of continualvigilance, at the same time pursuing a more secure and constructiverelationship with the East.   This means working for real andeffective disarmament;   and steady pressure for the full implementationof the Helsinki Final Act.
IV     BRITISH INTERESTS AND OBJECTIVES-25.   The geographical and economic facts of life make it inevitablethat today, as in previous centuries, British interests shouldextend round the world.    The Government believe that Britain hasthe assets to defend her interests and effectively to promte herobjectives.   These assets include our economic and military strengthas a nation;   our historical ties with many members of the inter-national community;   the lining force of the English language;   ourunquestioned standing in the arts and science and our contributionto the world&apos;s cultural heritage;   the example of British valuesand our country1s democratic way of life;   but above all theinfluence which we derive from cooperative aid coordinated actionwith our partners in democracy.26.   There has been too much pessimism about Britain&apos;s future.With realism, imagination and steady endeavour, we can assure andstablise Britain&apos;s place in the world.   It is against this back-ground that we should develop a longer term approach to the questionof our overseas representation.27.   Britain&apos;s objectives overseas are:(a) to safeguard the security of our country;(b) to promote its prosperity;(c) to uphold and extend the basic values aid freedomsof our democracy;(d) to honour our commitments and obligations;(e) to work for a peaceful and just world;(f) to contribute to the achievement of the aboveobjectives by providing assistance to developingcountries.2Q.   Economic matters are inextricably part of British foreignPolicy,   we import half our food and more than haf of our rawmaterials.   The exports which go to pay for these constitute betweenone-quarter and one-third of our Gross National Product.   Britain&apos;slleeds and interests as a trading nation will, for the foireeeablefuture, inevitably continue to be a decisive influence on our foreignPolicy.729.11
29.   The importance of economic and commercial actitivy must bestressed:    our overseas representation has to be geared to thePromotion of Britain1s economic interests and export opporutnities.But this does not mean that export promotion should be a pre-eminentrequirement of overseas representation in all countries of theworld;   the safeguarding of our prosperity also depends on theeffectiveness of our contribution to solving the problems cf worldeconomic management in ways which promcte our interests.   TheParallel importance of oar security and political interests, bothin their own right and as an influence on our economic fortunes,aust also be taken into account.   We shall not be prosperous unlesswe are secure.   The policy we adopt on Southern African issues willcolour the attitude   of all African countries and many more towardsus politically and economically and also towards Western interestsin general.   In the Middle East, political, and economic issues areinextricably connected.   The standing of Uis country in the eyesof the world is bound up with or stand on human rights, on how farwe can make our values, political, social and cultural, understood.Our assessment of our interest cannot therefore be confined eithergenerally, or in any one country, to economic or export considerationsalone.30.   The relevance of our objectives will vary from country tocountry and over time.    The aim is to focus our resources on thosecountries where our iiterests are greatest and where our efforts willPay the greatest dividends.   The detailed determination of Britishinterests and policy overseas, and the consequent detailed mix ofoverseas representation, requite us to look at each countryindividually.31.   This said, there is a sense in which the pursuit of economicobjectives takes precedence over all others.   Our ability to safe-Suard our security;    to be a reliable ally in the North Atlantic^eaty Organisation;    to be a constructive partner in the EuropeanCommunity and the Commonwealth;   to honour our international commit-ments and obligations;   arid to contribute, not least by our aidProgramme, to the building of a peaceful, just and prosperous world,from which we shall benefit asMnuch as anyone else, depends      thelast resort on our economic strength.A12
V     THE FUTURE PATTERN OF BRITAIN&apos;S OVERSEAS REPRESENTATION32.   Foreign policy is about what has to be done;    diplomacyabout how to do it.    Diplomacy normally has to be conducted inconfidence and with discretion.   To achieve our foreign policyobjectives entails complex and delicate negotiations, frequentlycoordinated with our Allies or Community partners.   Many of thesenegotiations would stand little chance of success if conducted inthe public eye.   Yet, without greater public information anddebate, there can be little chance of the necessary public under-standing;   it is essential that the basic aims of British foreignPolicy should be supported and understood by the people of Britain.33.   In a survey published early in 1978 of some dozen issues andthe order of importance accorded them by the British public, onlyone foreign policy question was listed - Rhodesia - and this tookbottom place.   This is why the Government, in support of theiroverall objective of providing a more open and accessibleadministration, are making a special effort to explain publiclytne objectives of our foreign policy.   This is done in Parliament,through the media and in a multiplicity of international bodieson the main areas of activity - Southern Africa;    disarmament andnon-proliferation;    East-West relations;    the North-South Dialogue;development assistance and cooperation;    and the European Community,^he Government are also publishing two new series of papers:foreign Policy documents and Background Briefs.   These are designedto increase the flow of available public information about theformulation and the conduct of our foreign policy.34.   The problem of encouraging greater public understanding hasDeen compounded by the growing complexity of international as ofdomestic affairs.   There is a necessarily increasing call forspecialised expertise:    at home for instance in economic andstatistical skills;    abroad in international trade and finance,in European Community matters and so on.   The corollary has beenan ever-growing number of meetings attended by officials atnational and international level.    The increasing tendency toreplace negotiation between individual states with negotiationbetween groups of countries or in international organisations --/called13CONFIDENTIAL
called multilateral diplomacy - and the proliferation ofinternational organisations themselves have led inevitably to acertain bureaucratization of the conduct of foreign affairs, withimportant negotiations bogged down in detail or settled intounimaginative routine.    Politicians, as representatives of thepeople, can find, through a combination of technical complexityand pressure of work, that it is increasingly difficult for themto provide the stimulus of political input which in many cases isnecessary for progress.35.   To some extent these are general developments affecting allareas of government.   The growth of bureaucracy is not unique tointernational affairs.    The problem is inherent in contemporarysociety and presents a central challenge to government, not onlyin Britain but in all other democracies.   The growth of impersonaland distant government machines is a challenge to democracy itself.!f we can make government more accessible and sensitive to theneeds of the people and their democratic representatives, westrengthen the democratic base of Western societies.   The coreof the government&apos;s approach to the whole issue of British overseasrepresentation is that it must, in as far as this is humanlyPossible, reflect faithfully British society in the round - itsattitudes, style, values, interests and concerns.36.   The Government recognise that a number of organisational andstructural changes will be necessary if this objective is to beachieved and Britain&apos;s overseas representation is to be effectiveand relevant to our future needs as a country.    In reaching thefollowing decisions the Government have carefully considered thedetailed analysis and recommendations provided by the report ofthe Central Policy Review Staff;    and the reports of the SelectCommittee on Overseas Development, the Expenditure Committee ofthe House of Commons, and its Defence and External Affairs Sub-Committee.    The Government*s detailed responses to the recommend-ations set out in these reports are summarised in tabular form inthe Annex.14CONFIDENTIAL
37.   The Government have identified five major and overlappingareas in which reforms will be introduced and new guidelines laiddown.   The aim is:(i)   to increase specialised knowledge in our overseasrepresentation;(ii)   to build a closer working relationship between theDiplomatic Service and the Home Civil Service;(iii)   to improve the coordination of our overseasrepresentation, and of the resources devoid toit, both in Whitehall and abroad;(iv)   to have a Diplomatic Service fully responsive togovernment and British society;(v)   to maintain a wide but cost-effective system ofresidential representation overseas.^ere changes in current practice are envisaged, there will beconsultation as appropriate with the Staff Sides concerned, andtheir views will be taken into account. Sterchanp;p and Expertise38.   The great extension of government activity since the War inAstern Europe means that inter-governmental relations and European^unity business now cover subjects that were previously ^ff* Private enterprise or not at all.   The conduct of external .ffairsSquires the constant reconciliation of domestic, Community and   ider^rseas interests.   As the spread of traditionally domestic issuesbeen increasingly drawn into international negotiations, so** more members of the Home Civil Service have been drawri into^Plomatic activity and more and more Diplomatic Service Officers*** home affairs.   A survey of overseas visits made by staff fromDepartments of Trade, Industry and Prices and Consumer Protection^ing 1975 showed a total of 3,528 visits abroad   of ^186Evolved Ministers or Permanent or Deputy Secretaries.   Houghly half&quot; all the senior staff at the Office of the United Kingdom PermanentRepresentative to the European Communities, including the Deputy^manent Representative, is drawn from Home Departments, who provide52% of the Counsellors and 61% of the First Secretaries.39-   Clearly many members of the Home Civil Service have a great4e*l in common with their colleagues in the Diplomatic Service, but/this
this does not mean that they should be merged into a single service,which would tend to isolate both the management and the policydirection of staff engaged on the external work of Home Departmentsfrom the domestic aspects of the same work.   The Government havedecided to make no change in the present balance of Ministerialand Departmental responsibilities, but to respond to the growinp;integration of domestic and external policies by increasingsubstantially the interchange between the Home Civil Service andthe Diplomatic Service.   They are determined that staff workingoverseas should have a better understanding of the concerns andPriorities of the Home Departments;    and that the DiplomaticService as a whole should strengthen further its knowledge ofand expertise in the specialised commercial and economic functionswhich are a normal part of the responsibilities of overseasrepresentation.   A wide process of interchange will be establishedbetween the Departments of Government.   This will be supplementedby short-term attachments and the joint training of Home CivilServants and Diplomatic Service Officers.    It would be desirableif the process of interchange could be extended to industry,commerce, banking and the trade unions.   The Government willconsider ways in which this might be achieved.*K).   Of the options put forward by the CPRS, that involvingintegration between the Diplomatic Service and the Home CivilService and the creation of a Foreign Service Group was, aftercareful consideration, rejected by the Government.    They felt thatthe CPRS&apos; third alternative - interchange - had, if effectivelyapplied, the overriding merit of preserving the flexibility of asmall, efficiently-run andfprofessional Diplomatic Service withall the benefits that this entails in terms of firm Ministerialcontrol and tightly monitored expenditure.    It was also felt thatlanguage specialisation and the other skills acquired within thediplomatic Service could easily suffer from integration.    A furtherconsideration was the consequential disruption and morale problemswhich could stem from a controversial administrative change.The Home Civil Service should benefit from interchange as muchas the Diplomatic Service.   Many Home Departments need greaterexperience either of dealing with foreigners on their own ground,0r of various aspects of external relations in which the Foreignand Commonwealth Office has a highly developed expertise.   There isCONFIDENTIAL /no1A
no intrinsic reason why members of the Home Civil Service shouldnot become Ambassadors and senior members of the DiplomaticService occupy equivalent positions in Home Departments.42.     These considerations apply with particular force to exportPromotion. . Until 1965 the then Board of Trade provided staff forthe Trade Commissioner Service, which was responsible for exportPromotion in Commonwealth countries.    Since 1965 there has been aunified export promotion service manned by staff from the DiplomaticService, working closely with the BOTB, the Department of Trade,other Government Departments, and semi-official and private bodiesconcerned with the export trade.   The BOTB and other businessmenare agreed that the unified export promotion service has led to amaoor improvement in the standard of service at posts overseas, andthe Government has decided against any organisational change inthis area.   However, with the passing of time fewer people dealingwith export services in London have direct experience of conditionsoverseas.   An extended programme of interchange would do much toovercome this.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is drawing upa scheme to improve export services skills among diplomatic staff.This will entail increasing, within existing manpower and costceilings, the resources and time devoted to training, withParticular emphasis on practical work.    Greater interchange,Particularly between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and theDepartment of Trade, will provide more coherence and a widersPread of the necessary expertise.?3.   To meet the need for more interchange in this and other areas,the Government are setting up a programme, the aim of which is tosecure some 200 interchanges - 100 in each direction - over thenext four to five years, in addition to the 193 which alreadyexist.   Seventeen Whitehall Departments will take part in thisProgramme, with the main burden being carried by the Trade andIndustry Group and the Ministry of Overseas Development.   Most ofthem already have some experience of interchange.    Secondments willhe directly arranged between the Foreign and Commonwealth Officeand the Departments concerned.    The Civil Service Department willMonitor the programme.    The Government envisage that about two-fifths/of17
of the programme will be completed by the end of its second yearof operation, at which time it will be evaluated by Ministers,problems considered and a path mapped out for completing thesecond stage.44.   The proposals involve considerable personnel problems, someof which may require modification of existing arrangements forremuneration and allowances of home-based staff if they are to betackled successfully.    Greater precision in career planning forall concerned will be necessary.   It will be important thatinterchange should be of real value in terms of increased expertiseand relevant experience abroad for members of the Home Civil Serviceand at home for members of the Diplomatic Service, rather than beingundertaken simply to meet the targets.   A major effort will have tobe made to increase the number of places available for the second-ment of members of the Diplomatic Service into the Home CivilService.   At present there are 139 secondments from the Home CivilService to the Diplomatic Service and only ^ in the other direction,In any event the ratio must not be allowed to deteriorate further;if possible, it should be brought more into balance.    The Governmentalso recognise that, given the comparatively small size of thediplomatic Service and the limits which this places on its capacityto absorb secondments, a proportion of those Home Civil Servantsseconded should serve in London in the Foreign and Commonwealth0^fice.    Difficulties may well arise over the fact that serviceabroad by members of the Home Civil Service is expected in mostoases to be on a voluntary basis, relying on the attractiveness ofinterchange within a well-planned career to produce a sufficientdumber of volunteers.    Care will therefore have to be taken thatHome Civil Servants are appointed to a representative cross-sectionof posts abroad, without excessive concentration in those postswnere the Home Departments are already well-represented.*5.   All this calls for a high degree of cooperation, mutualconfidence and flexibility in Whitehall, and a considerableincrease in the numbers of Home Civil Servants volunteering forservice overseas.   The Government are, however, determined to giveprogramme the necessary priority for it to be successful./46.18the
Coordination at Home and Abroad4-6.   The responsibilities of most Government Ministers have asignificant overseas dimension and each must take this overseasdimension, like any other factor, into account in formulatingpolicy.    In many fields, the Minister with the predominantfunctional interest, even though it may be primarily domestic,should and does take the lead abroad.   Experience at Councilmeetings of the European Community in Brussels shows that thisis not incompatible with a coordinated British approach acrossa wide spectrum of policies.    Overall coordination of UnitedKingdom policy in the Community is provided by the Cabinet Office.This said, the Government believe that the precondition for aProperly coordinated and integrated approach is that the overallconduct of overseas relations in the broadest sense of the termshould continue to be the responsibility of a single CabinetMinister, namely the Secretary of State for Foreign and CommonwealthAffairs.    This arrangement, within the framework of the Cabinet&apos;scollective responsibility, offers the most effective means ofproviding the right level of political input and control.    It isa responsibility exercised through the direction that the Secretaryof State gives to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and BritishMissions overseas;    and, in relation to the European Community,through the Secretary of State&apos;s close working relationship withthe European Secretariat of the Cabinet Office.    This has developedinto an effective mechanism for coordinating at official level allEuropean Community activity, and will continue.47.   The responsibility of the Secretary of State for Foreign andCommonwealth Affairs in relation to the European Community includesthe development of political cooperation between the membercountries.   This lies outside the Treaty of Rome and is an inter-governmental mechanism by which major international issues - forexample, the problems of the Middle East and Southern Africa -are discussed and common Community positions developed.A8,19
1*.   Within this overall structure there is room for improvementin the coordination of policies and in the joint identificationof, and agreement on, priorities.   Country Assessment Papers,which nrovide the basic policy guidelines for each country whereBritain is represented, will in future be prepared by the Foreignand Commonwealth Office in association with all relevant GovernmentDepartments.   This new system has already begun operating.   Itwill provide a more effective means of reaching agreement betweenthe appropriate Government Departments on the scale and nature ofresources to be devoted to our overseas representation in eachcountry.   In addition, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office andother Departments from time to time produce joint major policyPapers on areas and issues of major importance; where possiblesome of these documents will be published in the Foreign Policydocument series.^9.   Similarly, missions abroad should reflect the concerns andPriorities of the Government as a whole.   This will be facilitatedby greater interchange, jointly produced Country Assessment Papersand improved inter-Departmental discussion of external issues.But once priorities, policies and the resources to be deployed onoverseas representation in a given country have been agreed, theseaust continue to be fully reflected in the work of the missionsabroad.   The Head of Mission, whether Ambassador, High Commissioner,Charge d-Affaires or Consul-General, must provide the same direction,unity of purpose and coordination of policy as does the Secretaryof State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs across the wholefield of external relations.   The closest analogy to the Head ofNission-s function is to that of the captain of a ship, bringingall the component parts of the Mission together into a unifiedwhole under the Head of Mission&apos;s authority and direction.50-   The political work of an Embassy cannot be divorced from itseconomic work, or from export promotion, aid administration orcultural activities.   All should be mutually reinforcing;    and nonecan be conducted in a vacuum without reference to each other or totbe overall effort of the Mission.   The Government, having carefullystudied various recommendations, believe that the present/integrated20
integrated staffing of posts abroad brings benefits immeasurablygreater than those which might flow from separate export promotionor aid administration services.The Diplomatic Service51.   Over the last thirty years, those who have representedBritain overseas - whether in the Diplomatic Service, the HomeCivil Service, the Armed Services, the British Council - havecarried out their task during what has been one of the mosttesting periods in British history.   In general the job has beendone effectively, enthusiastically and with dedication.   TheForeign and Commonwealth Office and the Diplomatic Service, whohear the brunt of representing Britain overseas, have, in addition,already undergone and successfully adapted to a number of majorstructural and organisational changes flowing from the Duncan and lowden Reports.   A single Diplomatic Service was created in 1965,through the amalgamation of the Foreign Service, the CommonwealthService and the Trade Commission Service;    the Foreign andCommonwealth Offices were brought together in a single office in1968.   Export promotion and commercial work have become increasinglyintegrated into the duties of the Diplomatic Service.   This is inaddition to the major operational changes which have already takenPlace in the conduct of Britain&apos;s external relations, to takeaccount, for instance, of our membership of more than 120international bodies, not least the European Community, and theway in which this has modified the traditional pattern of bilateralnegotiation.52-   Recruitment to the Diplomatic Service has also changed overthe last generation.   It now comes from a much broader base ofBritish society.   In the 1950s, one in seven of new administrativeSrade entrants came from state schools; in recent years, thefigure has been just under one in two.   The equivalent figures fornon-Qxbridge universities are one in ten and one in three.   Newgenerations of recruits have changed and with them attitudes arechanging too.?3.   But there is a continuing need to adapt to changingcircumstances.    Those who represent us overseas must expect to/find21
find their activities subjected to greater publicity than in thePast and to closer scrutiny on the part of the public andParliament.   The meshing of foreign and domestic affairs is boundto generate greater public interest in external issues as itbecomes increasingly clear how far the prospects for employment,Prosperity and our way of life in Britain can be affected byevents and negotiations overseas.   This is increasingly thePattern, for instance, in our dealings within the EuropeanCommunity.5*.   The requirement to serve abroad - which ensures that ouroverseas representatives have a wide and necessary knowledge ofthe many different countries with which they have to deal - carrieswith it the risk of their becoming, or seeming to become, distantfrom the attitudes of the British Government and people.   This isa universal occupational hazard of all those who serve abroad fora*y length of time, whether in or out of Government.   In the caseQf Britain the risk of losing touch has been compounded by theProfound and rapid changes which have taken place in the lastthirty years in British society, in Britain&apos;s place in the worldin international affairs generally - changes which the nationas a whole has found difficult to assimilate.55-   Frequently, for instance, a genuine dilemma arises in theneed to balance a style of representation appropriate to theUnited Kingdom in the last quarter of the 20th century    with onev;hich will help promote British influence and interests in thehost country.   These two considerations are sometimes contradictory.k mansion for an Embassy and a Rolls Royce for an Ambassador mayse*m to some an out-of-date extravagance when set against much of^itain-s contemporary life-style.   But there remain many countriesin the world where great importance is still attached to the style0r foreign representation;   where we have major interests to defend;aQd where if the representatives of Her Majesty&apos;s Government lived,^veiled or entertained in a style markedly inferior to that oitheir more important Western European counterparts, they would findlt harder to carry weight with those who make decisions.   Butattention is seldom, if ever, drawn to the numerous Missions whereEditions are poor;   where the lives of our representatives are at/risk22
risk;   where health facilities are bad, and where general livingconditions are well below those in Britain.56.   The Diplomatic Service has high morale and traditions ofwhich it is justifiably proud.   These are national assets whichit would be foolish to discard or under-estimate.    It is aspecialised service with its own important and often under-ratedskills, not least the ability to speak foreign languages and tounderstand foreign countries throughout the world.   The DiplomaticService employs some 5,000 people, fev:er than 2,000 of whom are whatnre conventionally thought of as diplomats;    its communicationsexperts, archivists, secretaries and security officers all acceptthe same obligation to serve anywhere overseas;    they are asessential as the diplomats to the efficient working of the Service;and their loyalty and sense of dedication are just as great.57.   The question is one of balance.   We need to ensure that thequalities which distinguish the Diplomatic Service - b stronpcorporate spirit and readiness to serve anywhere in the World,frequently at little notice and in difficult conditions - are notoffset by a detachment from the rest of government and of Britishsociety.Aj orld-Wide System of Overseas Representation58.   The nature of international relations and of Britishinterests in the world is such that in principle there is nov -greater not a lesser need for effective overseas representation.When Britain was an imperial power v;e could and did on occasionsenforce our will.   Today the defence of our interests is mainly -matter of patient persuasion and skilful negotiation, bilaterally,multilaterally, within and through the European Community.   Thusit is precisely because our power as an individual nation isdiminished, while our interests remain global, that Britain&apos;sfuture is more dependent than ever on the skills of those whoRepresent us abroad.    There can therefore be no question ofdeliberately reducing the calibre of those who are rocruibed  Corservice overseas. *
59.   As a permanent member of the United Nations, and because ofour special commitment to the Commonwealth, there are strongarguments for the United Kingdom to be represented even in somecountries where our economic interests seem negligible.   Closureof missions is probably the most clear-cut way of making economies.In a small country, for example, this can save around  150,OCXannum in running costs.   Yet our capacity to influence othergovernments is severely handicapped once resident missions arewithdrawn.   Even the economics can be illusory.   The closure of oneMission in one foreign country, and the subsequent closure of thatcountry-s mission in London, led to a net loss on the balance ofPayments.   We need to put our overseas expenditure on missionsabroad in proportion.   Over  ?60 million is spent by foreigncountries on their diplomatic representation in London as against?oreign and Commonwealth Office expenditure overseas of  137 millionKone of our main industrial partners spends less than we do onoverseas representation.   There are at present POO British postsabroad with UK-based staff:   this is broadly in line with thecomber of posts maintained by comparable countries.   Once a missionhas closed re-opening is a costly and time-consuming business.60-   This said, there is room for manpower and cash economies, andthe more flexible and cost-effective use of resources.   Mission;;,ev*n if slimmed down, tend to grow again in size and in workload.61.   The introduction of mini missions with only two or a few moreP6ople can provide useful representation at minimal cost.   It alsofacilitates a more rational deployment of resources, so that we canfocus on those countries and areas which will repay the effort made,^is is now going ahead in certain countries where our interestsare real but limited.   As a general rule it is preferable to with-^awal or representation from another capital.   Besides the UnitedKi06dom&apos;s 131 missions there are 89 subordinate posts.   Ascommunications develop, posts of this kind can sometimes be more6asily closed, and 34 have disappeared since 1970.    Following a^Hew a further six subordinate posts will be cloned.   Five moreare under consideration.24
6?.   There is clearly room also for further reductions in thesize of missions, and of subordinate posts where this would notlead to a reduction in essential services.   Close scrutiny isbeing given, for instance, to our missions in. other Communitycountries where officials from the Foreign and CommonwealthOffice and from Home Departments have increasingly direct contactsWth their opposite numbers, and where there may be a reduced needfor some of the resident staff on the spot.   The burden of a&quot;ission-s duties and priorities varies from country to country,dust as conditions in each country frequently change with all that*is entails for the resources deployed.   In some cases the workload may have to be cut to match any reduction in numbers.   Thereis no alternative, therefore, to a system of regular and rigorousinspection of missions and of deciding on a case-by-case basis onthe wisdom or otherwise of redeploying staff and effort.   Similarly^e regular Inspection system will, as part of its normalresponsibilities, scrutinise the grading of posts.   There is nothingimmutable about the grading of a post or the number of posts in agiven grade.63-   An important consideration bearing on the size of missionsa*d the number and size of subordinate posts is the question ofinsular services.   The Government believe that there would bebespread and justifiable public criticism if protection servicesWe*e withdrawn from many posts, and that public demand for theseservices is bound to increase with the continued growth ofcommercial effort overseas and of tourism.   Consular services*iU therefore be maintained on approximately their present level.B*t consular work will in future be self-financing by increasesin consular and passport fees in line with costs.   RepatriationPolicy will continue to be stringent and every effort will be madeto ensure that money advanced is recovered.W-   These questions underline the crucial importance of CountryAssessment Papers (see paragraph 48 above).   Missions and subordinatePQsts are inspected at three-yearly intervals.   The Inspectors willUse newly-prepared Country Assessment Papers.as working briefs.   Themodel Country Assessment Papers, incorporating the views of allthe other Government Departments concerned, should therefore ensurethat Inspectors are working to the most comprehensive and up-to-date/assessment25CONFIDENTIAL
assessment possible of our needs in any given country.   Since-968, Foreign and Commonwealth Office manpower at home andoverseas has been reduced by 9%, while expenditure on salaries*na allowances at constant prices has been held steady.    Overthis period there has been no reduction in the higher gradesfrom One to Four, which have shown a slight increase.   The sametrend to retain the more senior management jobs is evident inthe Home Civil Service.    The Diplomatic Service will considerthe scope for reductions in the number of higher grade jobs.It is also important that the decision to accept world-widecoverage with the introduction of mini missions does not contributeto any overall increase in the number of higher grade posts.    TheDiplomatic Service Inspectorate will continue to scrutinise allestablishments at home and overseas.    The Inspectorate^ task isnot, however, always to cut down;    on occasions there is a goodcase for increasing the priority and effort given to a particularcountry.^5.   The Government attach importance to ensuring that the careerstructure of the Diplomatic Service provides for flexible recruit-Qent and retirement.   A detailed review has been started which willcover the manpower needs of the Service through the 1980s, takingaccount of training margins and any reductions made in the size ofPosts.   An examination is in progress of the contribution whichAfferent forms of recruitment, including short service contracts,Could make to attracting staff with relevant experience in industry,commerce and other areas of national economic life for part oftheir career and in improving promotion flows in the middle grades.ore flexibility in appointment procedures for the senior gradesls heing considered.   Consideration should also be given to ast^ged introduction of annual leave, both to reduce any sense ofremoteness from the United Kingdom and to ensure that Heads ofto--ission and other officials in key positions can be in close touch&quot;itn Government Departments and need not be absent from their postssuch long periods as can occur under the present system whenas much as three and a half months&apos; leave can be accumulated.Co*isultation is taking place with the Staff Side on these andether structural issues./66.26
6&amp;   In three areas the Government have concluded that thecontinuous process of inspection needs to be reinforced byspecific reductions:    these are research, information and defencework.67.   Research Work.   The Research Department of the Foreignand Commonwealth Office maintains a comprehensive bank ofinformation, drawn from official and non-official sources, onforeign and Commonwealth countries;   on the UK&apos;s relations with*em;   and on their relations with each other.   Research Departmentsupports the geographical and functional departments of the Foreignand Commonwealth Office in their operational work by conductingresearch into issues as required by them and by generallyProviding a collective memory and continuity.   Research Departmentalso prepares on its own account studies in depth on particularissues.   It has the further responsibility of preparing materialfor public release in the Foreign Policy Document series, and inthe form of more general background studies.63.   The role of this Department has been reviewed in the light ofcertain recommendations made by the Central Policy Review Staff.The Government are satisfied that the high quality work which itd0*s is important and should continue.   But they believe thateconomies should be made.   The Government will therefore reducethe establishment of Research Department by 17% from 110 to 91.59-   Information Work.   Both the Duncan Report in 1969 and that ofthe Central Policy Review Staff last year concluded that we wereCo*mitting too many resources to information work.   In the aftermathof the 1969 Report, there had been by the end of 1975 a reduction ofmore than &apos;W% in our information staffs overseas.   Since JanuaryX9?6, when the Central Policy Review Staff started work, furtherreductions have taken place.70 -   Information work is an area of our overseas effort where it isnotoriously difficult to quantify results.   The information nervier-,of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office -and Central Office offormation are designed to defend and promote overseas the currentNicies of the Government, including the whole range of exportactivities. /7127
^0lne savings in the Information Departments of the Foreign andNmonwealth Office may follow in duo course.    Reductions in :*.omcOf  f-v.ne services provided overseas by the Central Office of^formation are currently under consideration.2871.   The British Overseas Trade Board and other prominent businessmenhave stated that the creation of the rinht climate of opinionoverseas about the British economy contribute? to the selling ofexports.   Moreover, it is the developed countries which are ourmost important markets, and which could provide much of the newinvestment ve need.   If our real performance is bad, this cannothe mitigated even by the best information work;   but our missionsmust correct distortions where they can and present the positiveaspect of Britain&apos;s performance which are often overlooked.Government Ministers and members of the BOTB, Heads of Mission aiConsuls-General play a major part in this.   But at a lover level usealso needs to be made of visual, statistical and other material todemonstrate British inventiveness, high quality technology andgeneral industrial stability and vigour.   Information activity isalso required on occasion to support specific political and economicobjectives in developed countries.72.   The Government are determined to maintain the effectiveness ofour information effort, especially in priority areas such i S trade.However, as a result of a detailed review post-by-post of ourinformation effort, reductions in our information staff of some16.5% (Diplomatic Service) and 10.5% (Locally-engaged) will shortlyb* implemented.   There will have been a reduction of more than 26%lll an information staff since the CH?S started their Review.   Thisincludes a reduction from 63 to 4-5 in the staff of the BritishInformation Services in New York, which will still remain by farthe largest single information unit overseas.   In addition there willbe a detailed scrutiny of information work in all future Inspections.
73.   Defence Work.   There has already been considerable rational-isation of defence work.   In the last four years the number ofService Attaches and supporting posts has been cut by 10%.   Thenumbers of British defence staff in Washington - our largestdefence establishment attached to any mission overseas - have beenreduced by 35% over 12 years.   There is still an important require-nent for Service Attache posts in support of defence cooperation,defence sales, information gathering and a combination of thesetasks.   But there is also scope for further reductions.7*.   It has been decided that the precise savings possible will beexamined on a post-by-post basis;   but the Government have set asavings target of 25%, and the Defence Secretary will seek to ensurethat it is met by examining critically the level of staffing(including the possibility of replacing resident with visitingstaff and single Service Attaches with a Defence Attache);   thecollection of defence information;    the deployment and selectionof Defence Attaches;   the provision by missions of support staffsfor Attaches;   and the possibility of seconding Attaches andsupporting staff to the Diplomatic Service.75.   As was noted in paragraph 46, the work of most Departments hasa significant overseas dimension, to which our overseas represent-*tion must contribute effectively.   The following paragraphs containthe Government&apos;s views on export services, education and culturalVork, the BBC&apos;s External Services and aid, which make up animportant part of our integrated overseas representation effort.76.   Export Services.   The Government have decided after carefulevaluation that the present structure and organisation are broadlysatisfactory, and the Government will continue to provide exportservices.   The British Overseas Trade Board (BOTB), set up in 197&quot;,exercises strategic control over the export effort and is primarilyresponsible for coordination between Government and industry,^dustrialists are in the majority on the Board.   The Area AdvisoryGroups of the BOTB, made up of businessmen with wide experience in^dividual markets, make a major contribution.   The BOTB has runinferences on export development in 17 regional centres, attended^ over 2,000 companies, and the staff of the Board have, over the/past29
past year, made about 10,000 visits to companies.    There havebeen over 7,000 participants in Fairs and Exhibitions under B0TBsponsorship and some 2,500 participants in the Board&apos;s Overseas^rade Missions.    The Department of Trade has recently introducedimprovements in the coordination of export promotion services:a trade directorate has been set up to strengthen links betweenthose sections responsible for trade policy, export promotion,and export credit guarantees.   Some restructuring of the divisionsconcerned with export promotion has also taken place and a newExport Policy Branch has been set up.   A Paid Technical CooperationUnit has been established in the Ministry of Overseas Development.77.   Market and product concentration is already part of thePractice of the export promotion services.   The Government agrees^ith the DEASC that the export promotion services are most effectivewhen they support and augment activities which firms or sectors ofindustry believe to be in their commercial interest.   The Governmentalso agree with the DEASC&apos;s assessment of the importance to theBritish economy of invisible earnings, and confirm their commitmentto allocate resources at home and abroad in a way which takes fullaccount of the requirements of firms involved in invisible exports.Geographically, there has been a significant redeployment ofresources towards the oil-exporting countries since 197&apos;S andfurther changes to concentrate resources more on particular marketsQf products will be based on the B0TB&apos;s on-going consultations withindustry, and in response to opportunities as they arise.   The^OTB has close links with the Sector Working Parties, and will payParticular attention to suggestions arising in the context of theindustrial strategy.The deployment of export promotion staff overseas, and thenature of the export effort itself, will vary from country tocountry.    In countries where political and economic decisionsare in the hands of a small group, the role of the mission asvhole, and their ability to secure access to and influence overnia ruling group, will be critical to the success of the export^rive.    in the state trading countries, commercial officers in^bassies have an important role to play in familiarising business-^n with what may at first seem an impenetrable bureaucracy.    This/is30
is not so necessary in developed, free market economies, wherefirms are more familiar with the market;   hut even here they oftenwed help over introductions, local rules and regulations, and the&quot;any non-tariff harriers to trade, and in such markets the exportPromotion services have a major role to play in gathering anddisseminating information about market opportunities and m makingarrangements for British exporters to be strongly represented attrade fairs and similar promotions.79.   Educational and Cultural Work.   The value of this category^ activity cannot be quantified, but the Government believe that^ Plays a distinctive and valuable role in projecting Britain^road, in furthering relationships with other countries and mSimulating the use of the English language.   Comparative figuresfor expenditure are hard to obtain, but it is clear that France^d Germany snend more than the United Kingdom in this field.National aid too has an important part to play in our relation-ship with developing countries and is often a welcome and usefulform of assistance.80-     To maintain a coherent policy, governmental involvement ands*Pport are indispensable.   The British Council is one of theinstruments through which Britain&apos;e longer-term national interestsa*e, and will continue to be, promoted.   The Government do not acceptth* Central Policy Review Staff recommendation for the abolition of*e Council.   But they consider that closer coordination is requiredv&apos;ith the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and also with the&quot;inistry of Overseas Development and the Education Departments.Jt is particularly important that the Council&apos;s valuable contributionln the field of educational aid should be implemented fully withinthe scope of aid policies determined by Ministers.8l-   There is further scope for rationalising our educational andCultural activities;   and for integrating them more effectively into0Ur overseas representation as a whole.   A country-by-countrylamination of how far separate British Council offices abroadCQnld be merged with missions is being conducted on the presumptionthat mergers, particularly of administrative support, should be6ffected unless there are good reasons for the retention of separate6stablishments.   considerations will vary from country to country./In31CONFIDENTIAL
In some, for example, a separate British Council office haseasier access to schools and colleges than a diplomatic missionwould have.    In others it has been useful at times to be able tomaintain a separate British Council presence in countries wherediplomatic relations have in the past been broken off.82.   The Government believe that it would be desirable for theBritish Council&apos;s structure and administration to be looked atcarefully, and a Management Review is to be undertaken.   In advanceof this Review, and as a basis for it, Ministers after consultingthe British Council will formulate a clear and considered view ofwhat they believe the Councilfs role and areas of activity shouldbe.83.   In the area of education aid, the Government see a continuingrole for the British Council and for the Inter-University Councilwhich provides a useful channel for our own universities tocontribute their expert knowledge.    They are considering thenationalisation of the activities of these bodies and of thetechnical Education and Training Organisation for OverseasCountries and their relationship to the Education Departmentsand the Ministry of Overseas Development.84. BBC External Services. The Government agree with the CPRS*nd the Expenditure Committee that the nation benefits from theunique reputation of the BBC&apos;s External Services as a well-informedunbiased source of world news and comments, and from theattention which is therefore paid to the information they provideabout Britain and British policies.   Their complete independencefrom the Government means that they can be more effective andinfluential than the Government1s own information service.   TheBB0&apos;S External Services are a proven success and represent anational asset which we should be careful to preserve.85.   The Government have decided that the World Service in Englishwill continue to be broadcast for 24 hours a day.   To abandon theround-the-clock service would damage our national interests andimputation out of all proportion to any financial savings thatmight be derived./86.32
86.   Cuts can however be made in some of the vernacular services.The pattern of vernacular services should not be regarded asimmutable.   A review of all the vernacular services is beingcarried out in order to examine ways of concentrating resourceswhere they can be put to the best use.   But financial savings madein this area will be small in comparison with the increase incapital expenditure which is now necessary to maintain the ExternalServices1 audibility.   The Government have authorised planning tohe undertaken to maintain audibility within the BBCs estimate of^at it considers technically essential.   The necessary capitalinvestment programme is expected to cost some  20 million (at 1977Prices) over the next five years.Q7.   Aid.    Some considerations of aid and trade have been coveredin the Government&apos;s White Paper in answer to the Report of theSelect Committee on Overseas Development (Cmnd 7213), which wasitself prepared against the background of relevant recommendationsin the CPRS Review.   The Review itself broadly endorsed currentaid policies and procedures, while suggesting that there should bea Management Review to take account of the increased size andcomplexity of the Aid Programme since the foundation of theMinistry in 1964.    Our aid strategy continues as set out in the1975 White Paper &quot;More Help for the Poorest&quot; (Cmnd 6?70).   The^location of united Kingdom aid is based primarily on the concept0* need, while also taking into account a number of other consider-ations reflecting our wider interests and historical links.    Theseinclude political and commercial factors.8*.   About two-thirds of our aid is disbursed direct to individualcountries;    the remainder indirectly through multilateral organis-ations.    Bilateral programmes need to be carefully related to thecircumstances of the recipient countries, and for this reason thereis often justification for very small programmes despite theirsometimes relatively high administrative costs.   The Governmentaccept that a critical eye should be kept on this, in the light of^e CPRS Review.    It is also agreed that the Ministry of OverseasBevei0pment will be included in the programme of Management Reviewsot Government Departments which is now under way.    Other importantproposals in the Review which have been adopted include the making/of33
of further efforts to simplify the terms under which technicalcooperation officers serve abroad and the rationalisation ofschemes under which students are brought to and supported inthe United Kingdom.   The Government have decided to allow asnail proportion of the bilateral aid programme to be availableto give higher priority to the commercial and industrialimportance of a limited number of developmentally sound projectswe identify in developing countries for which there is no prioraid allocation available.89.   Control of Entry into the United Kingdom.   A separate WhitePaper is being published in response to the report of the SelectCommittee on Race Relations and Immigration, and will cover someof the recommendations made by the CPRS.   The Government&apos;s responseto the other recommendations is given in the Annex./VI   CONCLUSIONS34
n    CONCLUSIONSIn the last fifteen years  there have been three major reviewsour overseas representation:    the Plowden Committee reported onpresentational services overseas in February 1964;   the Duncanpublished its report on overseas representation in July*5   and most recently the Central Policy Review Staff in 1977eviewed both the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and all aspectsBritish representation overseas-    In 1971 the House cf Commons^e&amp;diture Committee formed the Defence and External Affairs Sub-^ttee which has produced a number of reports relating to over-8 ^presentation and most recently published in March 1978 itsaliieW 0f ^ Central Policy Review Staff Report.    The frequency ofthftse reviews has been a clear reflection of Britain&apos;s needaPidly        radically to adjust to the new and hitherto constantly&apos;tl^V*nS demands of tlle post-War world:    to the creation of the^tic Alliance, to the dismantling of the Empire, to the with-0      from east of Suez.   In 1973 perhaps the most far-reachingaH the post-War re-orientations of British foreign policy took- entry into the European Community.   More than any otherw, .      factor, this has altered the international framework withinBritish foreign policy operates.   Now that the initial fivear Tie   *period of our Community membership is completed, the need toPraise today our overseas representation is as relevant as itaa ** 1963 or 1969:^     ^he detailed measures to which this reappraisal has led or will^   * and which are set out in detail in the preceding chapter, can^summarised as follows:(1)   There will be a programme of interchange between theforeign and Commonwealth Office and seventeen GovernmentDepartment s.    The programme will achieve one hundred additional8econdments in each direction over the next four to five yearsand will be supervised by Ministers.   The programme will be^Pplemented by short-term attachments and the joint training0* members of the Home Civil Service and Diplomatic Service.    The/Government35\
Government will consider the feasibility of extending inter-change to industry, commerce, banking and the trade unions.(2)     An intensive review of training for Diplomatic Servicecommercial officers is nearing completion.(3)   A system of wide but cost-effective representationoverseas will be established with mini-missions in countrieswhere British interests are limited.    The Government willtake steps to ensure that this does not lead to an increasein the number of higher grade posts.OO   Mini missions apart, there is a clear need for furtherreductions in the size of posts.   There will be a criticalexamination of the size and grading of missions.(5)   Six subordinate posts will be closed and the closureof five more is under consideration.   Reductions in the sizeof subordinate posts will also be considered.(6)   The establishment of Research Department in the Foreignand Commonwealth will be cut by 17* from 110 to 91.(7)   As a result of a post-by-post review there will be a cutin information staff serving overseas of some 16.5* (DiplomaticService) and 10.5* (locally engaged).    Savings in theInformation Departments of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office*ay follow, and reductions in some of the services provided bythe Central Office of Information are under consideration.(8) The Government aim to cut defence staff abroad by 25*.The precise details will depend on a post-by-post review.(9)   A detailed review cf the long-term manpower needs of theDiplomatic Service has been set in hand.    The emphasis of thisreview will be on flexible recruitment and retirement.    Areview of different forms of recruitment to the DiplomaticService is in progress and will cover, among other tiings,short-term contracts.   More flexible appointment procedures36/for
for senior grades are being considered, as is the phasedintroduction of annual leave to ensure that DiplomaticService personnel serving abroad keep in touch with HomeDepartments and are not absent from their posts for over-long periods because of accumulated leave.(10)   There will be joint consultation and agreementbetween the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the relevantHome Departments on the priorities, policies and resourcesto be deployed in any given country.    This will be effectedby means of jointly produced Country Assessment Papers.There will from time to time be major policy papers onexternal issues produced by the Foreign and CommonwealthOffice in conjunction with the relevant Home Department.(11)   The Government will publish two new series of papers:Foreign Policy documents and Background Briefs.    These willbe designed to increase the flow of available publicinformation about the formulation and conduct of foreignpolicy.(12)   A country-by-country review has been put in hand tosee how far separate British Council offices abroad can bemerged with missions, on the presumption that mergers shouldbe effected unless there are good reasons for the retentionof separate establishments.(13) The British Council&apos;s role, structure and administrationwill be reviewed.(14)   The Government are considering possible ways ofrationalising education aid activities of the BritishCouncil, the Technical Education and Training Organisationfor Overseas Countries and the Inter-University Council,and their relationship to the Education Departments and theMinistry of Overseas Development.(15)   The BBCs world-wide service will be maintained on aS^-hour basis.   All the Vernacular Services will be reviewed./(16)37
(16)   The Government have authorised planning to heundertaken to maintain audibility within the BBCsestimate of what it technically considers essential.The necessary capital investment programme is expectedto cost some  20 million over the next five years.(17)    Smaller aid programmes will be critically examined.(18)   There will be a Nanagement Review of the Ministryof Overseas Development.9?     A*   Against the background of these changes, some of the mainMatures of the present system of overseas representation will^e Preserved in their essentials.   Responsibility for the overallConduct of overseas relations in the broadest sense of the termVlH continue to be vested in a single Cabinet Minister, namely^e Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, so^at the right level of political coordination and input is^intained.    There will continue to be integrated staffing inposts abroad, under the control of the Hend of Mission, to reflect^e authority exercised by the Secretary of State for Foreign andCommonwealth Affairs in the conduct of Britain&apos;s external relations,separate Diplomatic Service will be maintained because of its^vantages as a small, flexible and professional service.   The^0vernment will continue to provide export and consular protectionSe;pvices.    The British Council will continue to be one of thelQstruments through which the United Kingdom&apos;s longer-termlGterests are promoted.&quot;   Taken together, the changes and new guidelines set out above,XlnPleraented steadily over the next five years, will enable ourVerseas representation effectively to meet the chnllenges of theQuarter of this century.    These changes are deliberatelyevolutionary in character.   They aim to build on that which iseady good, efficient and of proven value;   yet also to establishPattern capable of adapting to the future on the basis of aealistic but confident assessment of Britain&apos;s role in the world.38
C,        VIANNEKSgTAILS OF THE GOVERNMENT&apos;S RESPONSE TO THE RECOMMENDATIONSOF THE CPRSThe White Paper has set out the Governments conclusions0r* the need for overseas representation and how they propose toroeet it in the coming years.       It represents the Government&apos;sresponse to the main recommendations in the wide-ranging andthorough CPRS Review;    and to the comments on it in the ReportQf the Defence and External Affairs Sub-Committee (DEASC), both0f which the Government have found of great value.This Annex sets out the DEASC conclusions on those of theChapters of the CPRS Review which they treated in their Report,^e DEASC conclusions are followed by the individual CPRSRecommendations and the Governments response to them.CONFIDENTIAL
pI Methodology &quot;(Chaptor&quot;5 o&apos;f&quot; the CPRS Report)3.1.  Geographical variations in requirements should be monitored continuouslyCurrent practice3. 2.   The means of meeting requirements should be very flexible in functional areaswhere rapid changes are taking placeCurrent practice
Economic, Social and   .&quot;&quot;&quot;Bhvi ron.TiicnT.al wore(Chapter ft of tfte Cl^slTeview)DEASC Conclusions^p^Wc accept the CPUS evaluation of the continuing importance of economicwork and ihc possibility that Governments may need to devote mote resourcesto it. The GPRS have not, in our view, made a convincing ease for theirproposal that posts should reduce the level of reporting and analysis, althoughDepartments did claim that most of the suggestions for rationalising the require, ,merits for information are in line with current practice! There might be some &apos;advantage in formalising the arrangements for reporting and we think, that pestsmight welcome guidance from Departments on the need for analysis andinterpretation of data and on the priority which they should give to requestsfor information. In view of the evidence we have received about the presentarrangements for the analysis and circulation of information, and bearing inmind the CPRS&apos;s own assessment that duplication is more apparent than real,wc strongly doubt whether there is a need for an interdepartmental mechanismfor the commissioning and review of analyses. Nor can we see a case for abody to be set up to monitor the examination by Departments of Britishmembership of international organisations, although it is reasonable to requireDepartments to carry out regular reviews of the organisations for which theyare responsible. Wc would also expect all proposals for new membership tobe subjected to close scrutiny.34. With regard to the question of using resident slafi&quot; or visitors in this field,it seems to us not unreasonable that the justification for a resident abroad shouldrest on the fulfilment of one or more of the conditions listed by the CPRS,1although wc agree with the Diplomatic Service Staff Side (0 182) that recognitionshould be given to the problems of tiring and time-consuming travel, and to thepractical difficulties of booking flights, especially at short notice and on busyroutes. Brussels is a case in point and these factors will have to be borne inmind when consideration is given to any future proposal for a reduction in thesize, of the UK delegation to the EEC. We suspect that application of thesecriteria will produce more justification for resident stall overseas than the CPRSappear to suppose. We think that the Review has taken too little account of thelimitations in effectiveness of visitors, who must necessarily lack some of theadvantages of a resident representative, such as a knowledge of the local lan-guage, acquaintance with the personalities involved and an awareness of thepolitical situation. Finally, while we can sec the advantages of having a specialistgroup to deal with economic work, wc fear that the CPRS may have, under-estimated the practical difficulties, first, of arranging an interchange of thesemembers of the Diplomatic Service with other Departments for 25 per cent oftheir careers and. secondly, of persuading staff from departments other thanFCO to serve for the necessary periods overseas. Before any decision on thisproposal is made, detailed discussions will have to be held between the Depart-ments concerned and the Staff Sides.&apos; Departments should every five years review the UlCs participation in intcr-ftttional economic, social and environmental organisations, in terms both of theneed to participate and the degree of participation, and present the results of the. reviews to an interdepartmental body. New organisations should be joined onlyafter strict consideration and consultation with the FCCLe Government agree with the conclusion reached by the DEASC(Par&amp;graph 33 of their Report).     The present arrangement^ermits rigorous control to be exercised over proposals to^0*n new international organizations.     The annual Estimatesprovide an occasion for reviev/ing existing subscriptions and theneed for continued membership of all international organizations.
.2. There should be less economic reporting from posts and less interpretationand analysis of information reportedNot accepted.     The Government agree   with the DEASC1sconclusion (Paragraph 33 of their report).     The presentvolume of economic reporting is regarded as valuable byrecipient Departments.3. The resources put into meeting the requirements for information from abroadcould be reduced and rationalised by the following means:(a) The preparation of country policy programmes should include considerationof departments&apos; standing requirements for information in the light ofthe capacity of posts to meet them ...I.........-..........-.....AcceptedtfO &quot; Lead &quot; departments should be designated for the storage of differenttypes of information relating to overseas affairs, and should be consultedin the first instance by other departments needing informationIn most cases it is clear which Departments will have the &quot;lead&quot;,although topics can fluctuate between Departments.     To try tosystematise some means of designating &quot;lead&quot; Departments on everyObject at one point in time would be self-defeating.     Therecommendation is not therefore accepted.

Export Sorvj c \s(Chapter 6 of the CPRS Review)DE.A SC1 s Cpnclug .1. onH is hardly surprising thai our witnesses arc in favour of continued Gov-eminent support for export promotion services. We have no reason lo demurfrom this proposal although vvc note the CPRS view Hint the use nude byfirnv; of lite services is somewhat limited. We agree Lhat the major factors insuccessful exporting are mainly within a firm*s own control and tint, howevergood the services provided by Government, the best way of promoting exportsis for firms lo ensure Uiat their goods meet market requirements, arc of goodquality, mid are delivered on lime at the right price. Nevertheless, (he officialservices have an important role to play. We note Sir KonncuYs cxprc ion ofregret that the Review failed to make specific reference lo invisible earningThere can be no question that sneii earnings make an inimui.se contribution tothe UK economy and we would like to pay tribute to the work of the companiesinvolved. However, despite Sir Kenncth\s assurance lhat, in making his rceom-mediations the requirements of invisibles were taken fully into account, we arcby no means satisfied that this can have been so. VVc have sonic reservationsabout the statistical approach adopted by the CPRS to determine which postsarc candidates for closure. We do not believe, for instance, that it is possibleto assess the need for a post by reference to the number of British businessvisitors and responsive visits by commercial officers, or that small marketsshould be identified by reference to the value of visible exports from the UK.Our doubts on. this score are further discussed in the section of our Report deal-ing with organisation overseas. We would only say here that, before any sub-ordinate posts are closed, there should be careful consideration, in consultationwith invisible and visible exporters and their representatives, of their valuenot only to industry and commerce but to the UKs standing in that country.In principle, we accept that there should be greater flexibility in manning theexport promotion services in all establishments overseas, but we recognisethe serious practical difficulties, such as the loss of valuable contacts and thedanger of antagonising friendly countries. The CPRS did not anticipate thattheir proposal for directing resources lo specific markets and products wouldrequire any increase in expenditure. But this was dependent upon achievingsavings from, the assessed cost of closing posts mid reducing existing marketconcentration. It is not clear to us whether it was intended that the proposalshould be implemented even if the expected savings did not materialise. Weare impressed by the CBI*s views that, although identification of markets andproducts is a joint operation, &quot;... it is for the export promotion services tofollow industry&apos;s lead on the question of selectivity, as such decisions would bewortlilcss without the full support of industry.&quot;1 We consider that, provided theresources can be found and industry and commerce are fully involved, theseproposals should be pursued. On the other hand, the evidence we have takensuggests that there is little lo be gained from trying to impose greater selectivityas between different firms, except in the case of major projects. There iscertainly no enthusiasm among the witnesses we heard for a unitary export pro-motion body and there are misgivings about the desirability of having a separateMinister for Exports, partly because of the fear that other Departments mayconsider that Ihcy arc no longer so involved in promoting export trade. We donot share the optimistic view of the CPRS that the new organisation could be setup without disruptive changes, especially if divisions were to be co-located. Wenote the DOT&apos;s claim that geographical separation of their divisions causesno undue difficulty, but we see no reason why co-location could not beconsidered quite separately from the proposed re-organisation. It is not entirelyclear from the Review what arrangements the CPRS have in mind fororganisation overseas, although they stress that the change in departmentalcontrol should not be associated with any significant change on the groundand that export promotion staff would continue to work within an integratedpost. It is possible that the CBFs fears that the Ambassador may not befully in command of a unified learn arc therefore unjustified ; nevertheless,there is undoubtedly some risk that the new structure could be divisive, as fearedby the Diplomatic Service Whitley Council.2 We arc not persuaded that theinefficiencies of the present organisation identified by the CPRS arc of suchmagnitude that they call for a new structure or, indeed, that a new structurewould put them right. Nor do we consider that sufficient recognition has-been given to the practical difficulties involved, or to the problems they will poseto management. The CPRS have not, in our view, made a strong enough case tojustify a new organisation with a separate Minister in charge.
&quot; / Our inquiries have given us a reasonably clear understanding of the typeof support thai the majority of exporters expect from posts. While this willvary according to the type of product, the amount of Government involvement,and the requirements of visible and invisible exporters, the most significantdifference is between, on the one hand, larger firms with established exportmarkets and, on the other, newcomers to exporting, or to the market, andsmaller firms. There has unquestionably been a marked improvement in recentyears in the quality of assistance given to exporters and we suspect that thefigures quoted in the Review, and the conclusions derived from them, do notadequately reflect this improvement. Nevertheless, our witnesses were at onein saying that there was room for ftnlhcr improvement and their suggestions fallgenerally into line with the CPRS proposals. We welcome any suggestionsaimed at improving the cflicicncy of the export promotion services, and, subjectto overcoming the practical difficulties that have been described to us, weshould like to see a continuation of the existing trend towards greaterspecialisation, with more opportunities for staff &quot;to train with industry andcommerce and more inter-change of stafT between private firms and Depart-ments. We also welcome the FCO statement that they arc aiming for longerpostings where this is considered reasonable. However, we have not beenconvinced that a radical change in the structure of the existing services toenable full intcrehangeabilily of staff between export promotion work overseasand in the UK is necessary. It appears to us that the case for the same group ofstaff performing both ends of the work has been over-stated, althoughDepartments should encourage interch:uigcs of staff between the Home Civiland the Diplomatic Services if the work will clearly benefit. We also feelthat a case has not been made for the proposal that no less than one thirdof UK-based export promotion staff should be recruited from people withsome business experience. There is nothing exceptional about employingbusinessmen in commercial posts, and we have ourselves in the past rcoom-mended that this should be urgently examined for posts in the United States,and that it should be extended to other posts if successful.1 But we doubtwhether the needs of industry and commerce or the business expertise requiredjustify such a high proportion. Moreover, the proposal does raise somepractical difficulties about the career structure, as well as the effect on thecareers of normal age cutrants. We note, for instance, that the illustrativecareer in export promotion5 shows a late entrant of about 30 starting at HigherExecutive Officer and reaching Assistant Secretary level, whereas Rolls Royccspeak of the induction of some brighter and more highly qualified executives atabout Assistant Under Secretary level.3 It is by no means certain, in our view,that sufficient candidates of the right calibre will be forthcoming on an annualbasis. We would prefer an empirical approach, with Departments carrying outa detailed assessment of the vaiue of the late entrants already in post comparedWith normal-age entrants, before committing themselves to the level of rccruit-tnent proposed. Finally, we are not persuaded by the proposal to increase theproportion of locally engaged commercial staff from one half to two thirds ofthe total number of commercial officers overseas. This seems to us to be asomewhat arbitrary figure, which does not take sufficient account of the differentroles of locally-engaged and of UK-based officers, of differing requirements indifferent countries and of the variations in the quality and availability of localbusinessmen. Although some locally-engaged staff will continue to undertakeduty tours of the UK, with larger numbers there is an increased danger, recog-nised by the CPRS, that more will be out of touch with British industry andcommerce. Moreover, with a greater emphasis on training and specialisation andlonger overseas postings, the UK-based commercial officer will be equipped tomeet the criticisms which led to the recommendation for more locally-engagedstaff. We consider that there should be a further examination of the balancebetween the numbers of UK-based and locally-engaged officers in a rcprcscn-tativc sample of posts before any decisions arc taken.
6.1. There should be a small increase in Government assistance J^c^npromotion services and the current policy of using charges as a managementtool should be continued.   We recommend that:(a) charges for basic types of marketing information should be low or zero;(b) there should be reduced charges for some services for new exporters;&apos; * t(o) there should be special charges or waivers for firms and industries thatface periods of temporary  uncompetitiveness&apos;The present level of resources is adequate.

- *   Decisions aboui the geographical deployment of export promotion stall&quot; should.c taken in two stages: first, that required for responsive work and associatedinitiative work, and secondly, that required for market concentration exercisesOn this basis it appears that many subordinate posts, especially in developedcountries, arc not necessary for responsive work, and should be kept open only ifncy arc required for market concentration exercises, or for other functionsWhilst doubting whether responsive and initiative work can^e so clearly distinguished, the Government accepts that extrastaff should be, as they are, posted to markets of specialinterest to British exporters.

&amp; The export promotion services should be made more selective in three ways:market concentration exercises should be developed, using about half ofthe savings which should come from the closure of subordinate postsand the reduction in the amount of market concentration in mainmissions these market concentration exercises should last forlimited periods, cover markets suitable for both new and established-exporters, and involve a wide ranflp of co-ordinated instruments (e.g.additional staff overseas and support in the UK, Ministerial visits,outward and inward missions, trade fairs and promotions, publicity)ft) theSee paragraph 0f the White Paperremainder of the savings from closures and reductions in main missionsshould be devoted to product concentration exercises % . theseshould develop out of the requirements of industry, last for limitedperiods and be co-ordinated with market concentration exercises.The staff working on such exercises should normally be in exportpromotion services in the UK, but sometimes in the industry sponsordepartments, and sometimes overseasSee paragraph of the White Paper(c) the export promotion services should move publicly and positively in thedirection of greater selectivity between firms .Not accepted.

Wilhih the total resources devoted to the export promotion services- which,arc broadly of the right order of magnitude it would be desirable to devotemore resources to the collection and dissemination of overseas market information,to assistance for major projects, and advice, encouragement and publicity forexporters. There would probably also be some benefits from more expenditure ontrade fairs and promotions, assistance to exporters on independent visits overseas,enquiries from overseas and inward missions. Outward missions and the agency-finding service are of more doubtful valueThe pattern of expenditure is largely determined by thedemand for particular services. There have been increases inthe assistance for major projects and in advice, encouragementand publicity for exporters. In response to demand the Boardhas also increased its support for exporters at overseas fairsand exhibitions.4.12.

An educational goods and services exports unit should be set up based on thenucleus of the British CounciPs paid educational services unit; a TechnicalCo-operation Unit should be set up in the Exports Directorate to co-ordinate paidtechnical co-operation arrangements and to find business; its first head should be asuccessful manager of a private consultancyThe proposal to establish a central unit for paid technical^operation has been accepted in principle, and such a unit hasbeen established in the Ministry of Overseas Development.T*e British Council is already active in promoting exports ofeciucational goods and services, and the proposal to set up aspecial unit for this is relevant to the Management Review ofthe Council.^.24. There should be an increase in the proportion of locally engaged commercialofficers; where good ones are hard to find consideration should be given to payingabove the conventionally fixed salary, training less experienced people and enlistingBritish staff with commercial experienceAs the DEASC point out (paragraph 63 of their report) thePosed increase is arbitrary.     There is no simple formulaeciding what the proportion ought to be between locally^aSed and UK-based commercial officers.     Where highly skilledstaff are in short supply, an auction with competingNations is often counter-productive;   but a good deal oftl   .xibiiity is already applied in practice to ensure that goodldates are not lost.
6.25.  Locally engaged staff should be encouraged not to stWjoo^^i^but arrangements should be flexible enough to permit the retention     gooapeopleThis policy is generally followed.

UK-based st-ff working on export promotion should specialize in it throughoutIhoir careers, with postings at home and overseas, and occasionally in an industrysponsor division, on intergovernmental work, in ECGD, or in industry ;those destined for senior jobs at home or overseas should broaden out suchcareers as they progressSeeparagraph    ^    of the White Paper4.28. There should be a new type of recruit to the public service to do exportpromotion work, namely late entrants aged 25-35 with business experience; inaddition the possibility of recruiting businessmen with specific product or marketexpertise on short-term contracts should be borne in mindRecruitment to the Diplomatic Service is discussed atParagraph 65 of the White Paper.     The Home Civil Service recruitstaff with business experience at various ages and levels bothPermanently and on contract or secondment terms.     The proposala new recruitment scheme is not accepted.
&apos;.29. More resources should be devoted to duty tours of UK industry by locallyengaged commercial officers; all UK-based commercial officers on relinquishing aposition overseas should spend a short time in the appropriate geographical divisionof the Exports DirectorateThe Government welcome the first part of this recommendation.It would be impractical for all returning Commercial Officers tosPend as much as three months in the appropriate division of theDOT, but there would certainly be advantage in putting the presentarrangements, whereby such staff are called in for &quot;debriefing&quot;,011 a more formal footing.
Foreign Policy Work(Chapter 7 of the CPRS Review)DEASC Views and ConclusionThe Sub Committee thought that the overlap betweenForeign Policy and Political Work was such that&quot;they should be considered together (paragraph 65of their Report) and concluded- We consider it idle to expect thai there can be any reduction in thel-K.\s involvement in international issues, particularly in view of the impressiontoe CPUs formed of the eflort being made by three of the analogue countries.Moreover, wc believe that a broad view of the CPRS objective for the UKGovernment, of working &quot; for a peaceful and just world &quot;. leaves no room forabdication of responsibilities. What is likely to be required is flexibility in thedeployment of staff and versatility of stall members. Nor would we want tosee any change in the quality of posts&apos; reporting, although we consider that thepCO should continue to maintain close control over it and might considergiving guidance to posts both generally and explicitly as to their requirements.Similarly, wc believe that the FCO can usefully consider whether the store ofPolitical information maintained in London should be less comprehensive thanat present if the possibility of storage in the country concerned seems an efficientalternative.        [\7.1.  Posts&apos; reporting on foreign policy issues should be reducedThe ievel of reporting is regularly reviewed at inspections6 oasis of briefing received from all FCO and Whitehallintents concerned, and is monitored between inspections.?Co departments.     A general effort will be made toe Sporting to the minimum essential for the properct of the Government&apos;s foreign policy.
7.2.  The possibility of joint EEC reporting should be borne in mind ,,   Agreed7.3.  Wherever possible without loss of operational efficiency other countries&apos;missions in London should be used for the transaction of businessBusiness must be conducted through the most reliable andeffective channel.     Sometimes this involves contact withforeign Embassies in London;   in other cases it will meanthe use of our Embassies abroad.7.4.  There may be scope for making greater use of emissaries from London for thetransaction of foreign policy business^his already occurs in many cases where it is appropriate,^tension of the practice must be judged case by case.the ^,lere.snould he fewer routine exchanges of view with overseas countries abouts,tuation in third countriesisuch exchanges of view take place only when the twogovernments have something of value to say to eachother.
7.6.  The tendency to provide foreign policy expertise through visitors from Londonshould continueCurrent practice7.7.  Foreign policy staff should be specialists, spending about three-quarters of theircareers on this workThe Government share the DEASC1s view that foreignPolicy work and political work (as defined by the CPRS)belong together and are part of the same specialisation.Many Diplomatic Service officers will specialise inthis area and will spend the bulk of their career onthis work.
Defence Work(Chapter 8 of the CPRS Review)DEASC ConclusionWo recognise Ihc good intentions of the CPRS in seeking In imjwovcefficiency in Uic military clement ol our overseas representation and lo remtii-ini-nd (-onuituVs. We support incj c in general but arc not convinced that rcrnc-cJics can lie applied in such a facih m. nncr .*.s suggested. There is a limit 10the number of high quality officers available for appointment as Attaches, careerpatterns and appointing convenience may not match, language training is alengthy process and circumstances change rapidly to the detriment of forwardplanning. We brlicvc that the MOD should consider the CPRS proposalscarefully, where the recommendations are not already the normally acceptedpractice, and, when the opportunity offers, give official recognition to theimportance of Attache posts and their place in a good career pattern.    tm8.1.  Service Advisers in Commonwealth countries should in future be styledAttachesNot accepted.     The Government share the view expressedby the DEASC in paragraph 79 of their report.S.2.   There should be a cut of one-third in the size of the British Defence Staff,Washington, and the effects reviewed in two years&apos; time... See paragraph   7f      of the White Paper8.3. Resident defence staff in the FRG and France should concentrate on defenceco-operation and spend less time on representation and miscellaneous tasks.Service Attaches there should be of high quality and fluent in the local languageAccepted
J4. In other European NATO countries-defence co-operation work should bedone mainly on a visiting basisSee paragraph   7f       of the White Paper6.5. British Defence Staffs in Ottawa and Canberra should be cut by at least ahalf. See paragraph   If       of the White PaperS.6. 1 here should be a reduction in the resources put into collecting defence infor-mation about countries where British forces arc unlikely lo be involved or aboutpotential and actual conflicts where the UK has little or no influence. . See paragraph    7f-      of the White PaperI1,7. The Defence Sales Organization should be given responsibility for managingall the full-time.staff employed overseas on defence sales work; it should write jobdescriptions for sales posts overseas and have the right of veto over individualappointmentsThe Defence Sales Organisation already has an importantrole in tasking staff employed full time overseas ondefence sales work;   and are consulted on staffappointments.8.8.  There should be a considerable reduction in entertainment by Service AttacheService Attaches1 practice is closely tied to that ofthe Diplomatic Service.     See further comments underChapter 17.
J.9. Service Attache posts should not be established unless they can be justified by aneed for defence co-operation, defence sales or information gathering work or bysome combination of these prime tasks. This should lead to the withdrawal ofAttaches from 15 countries .. .  See paragraph    l*r     0? the White Paper6,10. There should be greater interchange of civilian staff between the MOD andthe FCO, with a slight increase in the number of jobs overseas for MOD civiliansin diplomatic missionsAccepted.iJ 11. The MOD should cease to rely on volunteers to fill Attache posts and shouldselect and appoint the best man for the job^o^v,   74-       of the White Paper-See paragraph    IT       UA12. There should be a reduction in the amount of language training given toService Attaches, particularly in hard languages. The MOD should consider usingofficers with proven language aptitude. There should be greater use of languagetraining in postAccepted in general.     But the level of hard languagetraining would depend upon the requirements at eachparticular post, and all Attaches will continue to needfluency in the language of the country adequate for theperformance of their tasks.4.13.   Where Service Attaches arc justified, the normal structure should be a DefenceAUachc supported, where necessary, by one or more Assistant Defence Attaches,anier than the present system of having separate single-service Attaches in manySee paragraph 7f&quot;     Qf the White Paper

Consular Services(Chanter c) oX the CPito Review)DEASC Conclusion- The cost of passport work is more than met by the revenue receivedfrom passport fees, but ii would be very difficult, if not impossible, for the costof the remaining work to be recovered from consular lees. For some years ithas been official policy to treat passport and consular services as an entity. Wewould not wish to quarrel with this policy. If the FCO achieve their aim ofrecovering 80 per cent of the total costs in 1977-78, the net cost of providingthe services will be of the order of  -3 million. The main alternatives to meetingthis expenditure from public funds are cither to increase fees or to withdrawconsular services from most subordinate posts in Europe. Passport and consularfees were increased (by 25 per cent) in February 1977 and the CPRS estimatethat a further increase of 25 per cent would be needed if it were decided torecover all costs. As wc have noted&quot;, an increase of 10 per cent in passport andconsular fees took effect in March 1978. Wc feel that the FCO should aim,over the next ten years, to increase passport charges to cover consular costs.However, wc consider that arbitrary cuts in the number of subordinate posts,which could result in greatly increased hardship for travellers in difficulties,especially those who do not know the local languages, would be unacceptable.Wc welcome the Foreign Secretary^ announced intention to look at these postswith a view to making sensible reductions. The consular services provided ;trebroadly in line with the analogue countries and we would not want to seethem reduced; wc suspect, in any case, that consular officials wouldfind it very difficult to lake a hard line in an area which the CPRS admitis impossible to regulate. Wc doubt whether a Ministerial announcementthat British subjects abroad should henceforth look after themselves wouldprove enforceable, even if it were desirable in principle... We were surprised that the Chapter of the CPRS Review dealing withconsular work contained no mention of the diplomatic function of consularposts in large, diverse and, in particular, federal countries. Just as ourrepresentation in India includes Deputy High Commissioners in major citiesother than Delhi, so it is necessary for its adequate functioning lor, say, ourembassy in the US to have consular offices in major cities other thanWashington. This was one reason for combining the Diplomatic and ConsularServices years ago. Even if this were not the case, British consuls in suchcities are regarded by the society they live in as representative of their country.A consulate, also, in such an area as California, may be the only source ofcommercial support to British exporters in a state whose GDP exceeds thatof most of the workTs independent states. fi9.1. Legal and documentation services should be provided at fewer posts.   In largecountries they should be centralized in one post**oS ort work is centralised where appropriate.   Other legaldocumentation work is more difficult to centralise, and the^0ice lies between continuing with it or abandoning it.    The0Ve^nment believe that the balance of advantage lies infining these services at about the present level.
J, 3.  The Government should not be involved in future in the administration of theestates of deceased British subjectsPartial administration is unavoidable when property has beenaccepted for safekeeping. Instructions on the acceptance ofproperty are already restrictive and are being tightened.y. 4.  Fees for legal and documentation services should reflect local cost and thesingle scale of fees worldwide should be droppediJ,5.  Consideration should be given to denominating Zees in local currency ratherthan sterlingNot accepted, because these proposals could, under presentlegislation, lead to a multiplicity of Orders-in-Council.It is doubtful whether Parliament would wish to concedethe principle whereby consular fees can be altered otherthan by Order-in-Council.^6. If savings arc to be. found in consular protection work they should largely&quot;come from withdrawing consular services from most subordinate posts in EuropeSee paragraph   3     of the White Papery 2.

\. 8. There should be a reduction in the number of persons repatriated to the UKand in the cost of this service.

In addition:[a) Interest should be charged on debts incurred for repatriation.i(6) The fee for second and subsequent repatriations should be at least doublethat for a first.(c) Magistrates should be encouraged to make more use of the penalties-     sble for people acquiring British Visitors Passports fraudulently.(&apos;0 In cases of medical repatriation where it is clear that there is little chanceof repayment the cost should be written off immediatelyIt is current Government policy that repatriation be carried outonly in cases of proved destitution, and consular officers haveinstructions to this effect:particular points:-^)   is under investigation.   Administrative simplicity isnecessary if such a scheme is to succeed.(b)   the difficulty of always determining whether the individualhas been previously repatriated militates against thissuggestion.

Control of Entry into the UK(Chapter 10 of the CPRS Report)The DSASC did not think it appropriate to considerthis chapter in detail since the subject fellwithin the ambit of enquiry of the Select Committeeon Race Relations and Immigration.1. The requirement for documents should be dropped in certain areas in theIndian sub-continent where it is known that documentation is poorThe emphasis on the need to produce documents hasbeen much reduced, and applicants are now told thatif genuine documents are not available they shouldexplain this at the interview and not seek to obtainirregular documentary evidence.    The Governmentbelieve   that this will be a more effective way oftackling the problem of inadequate documentation(discussed further in paragraph 26   of the Government&apos; sreply to the report of the SCORRI).

In addition the Home Office gives advicein general terms to sponsors who enquire about therules governing the eligibility of dependents forsettlement.    These arrangements are kept under review.Advisory services overseas are discussed in theGovernment1fl reply to the report of the SOOHRI(recommendation 24).

Applicants should not have to wait so long between the time they arrive atposts for an interview and the actual interview and there should be better waitinaroom facilities ^j-yperience has shown that atteraptR to fix precisetimes of day for interviews for each applicant ronuJtin a slowing down of the rate of interview because ofthe de,* roe of failure to attend at the appointed timefor a vnrirty of reasons.    The recommendation istherefore not accepted since it would load toincreased waiting times for interview..    Therecommendation for better waiting roci facilities isaccepted.   Improvements have already been made insevoral posts in the Indian sub-cortinent and areunder consideration in others.6. Efforts should be made by ECOs to make applicants feel relaxedCurrent practice7. Women interpreters should be introduced and there should be a panel ofpart-time interpreters to cover a wider range of dialectssee the Governments reply to the report of the Select CommitteeQn Race Relations and Immigration (recommendation 27).
Children under the age of 14 should no longer be interviewed aloneAcceptedThe search for family likeness should be droppedAccepted&apos;  Interviews should become shorter except in difficult casesThere is no requirement for Entry Clearance Officersto interview every applicant in full, and interviewsere shortened wherever possible.    For example the fapplications of women and children in the priorityqueues usually present fewer problems and theirinterviews ore in consequence usually much shorter.It should however be remembered that the primaryaim is to establish the genuineness of theapplicants and in other cases this will entail acfUite detailed interview./
11- Male fiances and husbands should no longer be interviewed as a general^le; instead an efficient system *on checking on those who have not registeredheir marriages within the required period should be introduced in the UKNot accepted.     The Government believe that the interviewingof fiances in the country of origin does serve a usefulpurpose in identifying some fraudulent and ineligibleapplicants and in acting as a deterrent to others.     Thereare already some applications from fiances who are noteligible to marry in this country, usually because theyare under the minimum age.     If there were no pre-entrycheck the number of such applicants would almost certainlyincrease substantially, and the increased volume ofenquiries after entry that would be necessary could not. be made effective without a significant increase inpolice and immigration resources.The interviewing of fiancees in the UK would not bean adequate substitute because it would not replacethe need for the ECO, before granting an entrycertificate to the fiance, to establish his identityand to check his age and capacity to marry and hisintention to contract a genuine marriage.     It would   -not be sufficient simply to establish that thefiancee has such an intention.     Any saving of theECO!s time at the interview is not likely to besignificant.^n independent body should review imethod of controlling the entry ofreview alternatives to interviews in posts overseasvisitors1 &quot;the Governments reply to**** Relations and Immiffxw&apos; s reply to the report of the Select Committeeand Immigration (reoommeixdation 7).
13. Visa requirements in countries where immigration pressures and security risksare small should be abolishedThe Government do     not oppose the recommendation inprinciple, but as the CPRS acknowledged in theirreport reciprocity is another factor to be takeninto account.14.

17.  Improvements should be made in the provision of legal advice for applicantsThe United Kingdom Immigrants Advisory Service(UKIAS), which receives a grant from the Government,already offers independent legal advice to appel-lants, and applicants are encouraged to make use ofits services if they decide to appeal.    TheGovernment will continue to provide financialsupport for UKIAS, consistent with the Service&apos;sneeds and with the availability of resources.lu shou,d be taken in the selection of adjudicators and improvementssnould be made in their preparation for the job.Care is taken in the selection of adjudicators.Arrangements already exist for adjudicators toobtain the necessary background to their work, andthe Government will keep these arrangements underreview.-19-   Delays in the appeals system should be reducedAccepted, in principle, but shortage of resourcesis likely to be a serious constraint.
&apos;*  Appeals statements should be written by Home Office staff in the UKWot accepted.   As the CPRS observed there areadvantages in the ECO who conducted the interviewwriting his own appeal statement.&apos; Moreover anyadvantages which might arise fromUsinp Homo Office Btnff t;o write appeal nt&quot;tomontnwhere entry clearance has been refuaed overseaswould be offset by the fact that it is moredifficult and therefore takes much longer for athird party in the UK to prepare a statement fromthe entry clearance officer&apos;s interview notes.21.  ECO posts should all be filled by Home Office immigration officers1The Government accept   that the proportion of immi-gration officers in ECO posts should be increased toabout 50&apos;/&apos;, but does not agree that all iEO postsshould be filled by immigration officers.    This wouldcreate a separate enclave of staff, whose integrationwith the rest of the mission might be difficult.   Amixed staff is more likely to provide a widerinterest in and understanding of the local politicaland cultural background.*jj There should be improvements in the training of ECOs including moreMilage visits so that they gain a better knowledge of local cultureAccepted

The Administration of Overseas Aid(Chantor II of the CPHS Review)DEASCs View&quot;The Sub-Committee did not wish to trespasson the ground of the Select Committee onOverseas Development, so their comments onChapter 11 of the CPUS Report are limited.They had some sympathy (107) for the viewthat there should be more specialist knowledgein aid administration overseas and thoughtthat there was a case for greater participationby the ODM in the overseas implementation ofits policies.     At the same time they entirelyaccepted the argument that aid administrationrequired an appropriate input of diplomaticand political expertise &quot;which could only beprovided by FCO personnel in posts&quot;.     Forthat reason they v/ould not regard a formallyconstituted separate specialist aid serviceas an appropriate solution, since it wouldartificially segregate aid and diplomaticpolicy considerations.     They did, however,see merit in a greater degree of interchangethan existed at present between ODM staff andthe Diplomatic Service.&quot;1. The number ol bilateral aid programmes involving disbursements of  1 millionor less (at 1975 prices) per year should be substantially reduced. The resultingsavings could be redeployed in the aid programme in various ways, including, itis suggested, to increased Ambassadors1 Funds in countries where the bilateralprogrammes are discontinued 1See paragraph ^ ^   of the White PaperL 2.

Education and Cultural Work(Chapter 12 of the gFRS Review)DEA.SC Conclusion141. Wc find Ihc Chapter on Educational and Cultural Work one of the leastsatisfactory in the whole Review. Our icjection of the main CTRS comments andrecommendations springs in no sen.se from an exaggerated caution or unwilling-ness i.) contemplate clnnpe. It rests on the simple proposition tlial, if damaginguncertainty and upheaval is to be avoided, the onus must be on those advocatingsweeping reforms to make out a convincing case ; something which, in our view,the CPRS have signally failed to do. This is all thd more true in the case of abody, such as the British Council, which is held in high esteem in many partsof the world, as even the CPRS admit, and which can fairly claim to have stoodthe test of lime. The Coucil is extremely fortunate, in our view, to enjoythe services of such an obviously dedicated staff, whose career structure is notas attractive as that of the Diplomatic or Home Civil Service.1 We are not surethat prospects could be substantially improved without changes in the characterand size of the Council of the sort which we have rejected on other grounds,although wc hope that the Government and the Council will examine the matter.We arc convinced, however, that to adopt the main CPRS proposals wouldplace an intolerable strain on the loyalty of the Councils Staff, for on obviousgain and with the prospect of real and lasting damage.     u%^Z^^i^10 Ulc gulUdl *****01    11See paragraphs 7?-83 of the White Paper^.2* Because of the new aid strategy, educational aid sbould not be an objectivein the more prosperous developing countries though small quantities of educationaltechnical co-operation to prime the pump for the later sale of PES is legitimate, &apos;n such countries .        -  -, Soe paraGraphs71-83 of the White Pnper^2.3.

External Broadcasting(Chapter .13 of the Ci&apos;-HS Review)DEAHC Conclusion\62. Wc believe that the BBC External Services form a vital part of Biitain&apos;sOverseas representation. The BBC! has a unique reputation for objectivity andreliability, buili up in time of war as well as peace, and based in no smallmeasure on the fact that it operates a genuine World Service free from anyincubus of political motivation. It would therefore be madness, in our view, toimpose swingeing cuts on the present service precisely at a time when, as theCPRS acknowledge, other countries are stepping up their efforts. To put theCPRS priorities into practice, irrespective of the illustrative option, wouldemasculate the External Services and reduce them to the level of a second-ratepropaganda station. Wc therefore strongly urge the Government to find the extrafinance for much needed improvements to audibility in key paits of the world.The money at present devoted to the external services represents, in our judge-mcnt, one of the most cost-effective items of expenditure within the Govern-menfs programme and one which would richly repay a further modestinvestment. By failing to make such an unequivocal statement of support foran increase in expenditure, the CPRS have only themselves to blame, in ourview, if their real intentions towards the BBC have been widely misunderstood. \f3**  The BBC external services should continue to be an integral part of thecorporation, financed by a grant-in-aid as at presentCurrent practice^iou^mfell n0t bC a.mouth-Piece of the Government and editorial controlnjuld remain the responsibility of the BBCs Board of Governors&apos;3.3.Current practice* The main objective of external broadcasting is to provide an unbiased source2 W,,? ncws and information- Conveying news about Britain and its culturewould have lower priority as an objectiveI See paragraph ^ q.   of the White Paper       .I4.

Information Work(Chapter&quot;14 of the CPRS Review)DEASC ConclusionJ23.wAlthough judgements about the right level of information work axebound to be largely subjective, we believe that enough doubt has been raisedby witnesses to warrant a thorough review by the FCO in concert with theCOI.

These cannot always be foreseen withcertainty.

Communications(Chapter 16 of the CPRS Review)DEASC1s ViewThe DEASC doubted the wisdom of the CPRSrecommendation to reduce the use of diplomaticwireless.     They thought it essential to keepopen a secure means of communication to asmany posts in the world as possible.(Paragraph 206 of their Report).1. The present controls on the Volume of telegram traffic should be retainedand future targets should take into account reductions flowing from recom-mendations in our reporti &apos;&apos;Now current practice.2. Consideration should be given to withdrawing diplomatic radio from allposts, provided an adequate emergency radio system proves viableobservations made by the kin        agree wlth thereport. y        DEkSC 111 Paragraph 206 of their
/fc,3. Diplomatic- radio should in any event be withdrawn from about half theposts currently .using it-.The financial savings from withdrawing wireless fromhalf the present posts which use it would be marginalwhen set against the extra cost of alternative means.The Government share the views expressed by the DEASC onthis issue (Paragraph 206 of their report) and are notprepared to accept unnecessarily the risk of Posts beingcut off in a crisis without radio communication.Nevertheless, communications are being re-examined tosee if any financial savings can be made whilst mainliningthe present degree of effectiveness.   While agreeing withthe DEASC (paragraph 208 of their Report) that themaintenance of proper security has important implicationsin any such re-examination of&apos;the use of diplomaticradio, the Government believe that a change from radioto other links may at times be in the public interest,and not detrimental to security./6,4. There should be a rationalization of duties between the variotis technicalgrades employed on communications. Radio operators should carry out moreof the basic maintenance on cypher equipmentThe Government accept that some rationalisation oftechnical duties between the different grades is needed.More than one staff union is involved.

But no single blue-print cancover all future requirements, and plans will have tochange with changing prospects.   Planning arrangementshave been revised and strangthened.
Entertainment(Chapter 17 of the CPRS Review)DEASC Conclusion.. *Ve believe that a pragmatic approach should be adopted towards enter-tainnicnt and that it should be regarded as a legitimate and often valuablesupporting function for other more specialised diplomatic objectives. It should. be used only when it is the best or only means to achieve a particular aim,unless there arc strong grounds for believing that a relationship or contact&apos;s so valuable, or likely to prove to be, that it requires cultivation throughentertainment. Entertainment, in other words, needs to be more selective andless general.1 We do not, however, think it necessary or useful to set a specifictarget for cuts, but if our suggested approach were adopted, savings wouldaccrue as a matter of course. As an aid to improved accountability we thinkfhat the idea of Mission Funds should be encouraged, on an experimental basisthe first instance. Whether this idea is adopted or not, there will be acontinuing need for Heads of Mission to exercise close surveillance over theamount of entertaining. We do not think that it is cither sensible or economicalfor less entertainment to be conducted in the home. We are glad to see from*he FCO&apos;s own internal Review that some of our comments and suggestions(and some of those made by the CPRS) are already being taken up and we hopethat this Report will provide a further si.mulus.     ,
17.1. There should be a reduction in the entertainment of locals with the purposeof general cultivation&apos;U VisUors from the UK should only be entertained when strictlyoperational purposes. Restaurant meals for vtsttors should be pcI fo - ou -o&apos;   their subsistence allowances.  Visiting offices should normally stay m hotel5&apos;7.3* The entertainment of colleagues from other diplomatic services is of lowPriority and should be reducedIBritish communities should not be entertained except for morale reasons inUnpleasant countries and for services rendered. There should be a clear Ministerialstatement that&quot; pastoral * entertainment is endingnl:Some entertainment of posts&apos; staff is justified for morale reasons, mainly inhard posts.   But it should require little official expenditure NThe theme of these recommendations, that entertainment shouldbe more selective and less general, was endorsed by theDEASC (paragraph 180) and the Government accept the aim.Heads of Mission and Heads of Section have been instructed&quot;to control and co-ordinate entertainment closely andInspectors have been instructed to calculate allowances moreselectively.     But the Government agree with the DEASC thatentertainment needs a pragmatic approach:   and that it is*ot sensible to lay down hard and fast rules for world-wideaPPlication.There should be reductions in entertainment by junior and middle rank staffAccepted
If.7.  The amount of entertainment done by individuals should be related to thcijobs.Current practice&apos;7.8.   Entertainment should become more informalThere is already a trend, which the Government endorse,towards less formal entertainment.   But it would be wrong toenforce informality where local circumstances, or theoccasion, demand a more formal style.&apos;7.^.  There should be much less home entertainment, and more small businesslunches or dinners in restaurants ^&apos;7.!0. There should be less entertainment involving spouses and where homeentertainment is necessary because of lack of facilities elsewhere it should notnecessarily involve them &apos;The Government accept the value of home entertainment, andbelieve that there is advantage in wives being involvedwhen appropriate.&apos;7u &apos;missio^0&quot;8&apos;^11011 Sh0Uld bC g&apos;Ven 10 providing entertainment facilities in theNow current practice
i7.J2.  Heads of Posts should be prepared to lend the public rooms of the Residenceto their staffWhere the Head of Missions Residence is suitable, otherstaff already make use of it.   But many Residences are notlarge and cannot be so used by them without seriouslydisrupting the family life of the occupants.&apos;7.13. There should be greater differentiation in thc funds provided for entertainment*n different posts and they should more accurately reflect differences in the needto entertain &apos;Accepted&apos;7.14.  Entertainment should be paid for from a Mission Fund and personal allow-ances should be ended for all staff except Heads of Mission ... - -experiment with partially pooled funds is being conductedduring 1978 in Southern African Posts.   A decision on-pooledfunds will be taken when the results of the experiment havebeen assessed.     The question of abolishing personalallowances will also be decided then.     But the presentsystem of fully accountable personal allowances alreadyftaS many of the features of a common fund:   allocationsa*e ceilings, not targets, and Heads of Mission may switchfunds between members of their staff.
17.15.  There should be a reduction in the element in frais for entertainment andconsideration should be given to making this element accountable &apos;The entertainment element in frais is set by Inspectorsand must be commensurate with the entertainment responsibilitieslaid upon the Head of Mission,     An examination is inprogress of how far the element could be made accountablewithout disproportionate administrative cost.^SLS nUmbCr 0/ulcmu inIJ,ndi,cct Representational Supplement which iiv mfa?teSnto^^ hUlU[i KbCCOmC ^&quot;tab Pand should be ZZon other items in IRS     ^ Sh0U,d bC * cons&apos;dc-b&apos;* in expenditureI17.17. As a result of these recommendations considerable savings in expenditureon housing should be made, because lower standards than at present will beappropriateSome of the items mentioned are already being transferredto the Mission Fund,  . But it is not practicable to transferothers.     Accommodation standards are being reviev/ed (seeunder 18.12).     If home entertainment is to continue, theappropriate provision for household running costs will haveto be made in IRS.I7.j8! Home entertainment allowances for DS staff in the UK should be abolishedThe FCO is considering alternatives to the present HomeEntertainment Allowance which provide the required degree offlexibility and are not cumbersome to administer.
&apos;7.19* An attempt should be made to get together with like-minded nations toagree reductions in the entertainment of diplomatic colleagues, including furtherreductions in National Day partiesSpending on the celebration of The Queen&apos;s Birthday hasbeen substantially reduced.     The level of entertainmentis a matter for individual gove&quot;mments and could noteasily be negotiated even amongst our EEC partners.17,20, The FCO should set as a target the reduction of expenditure on entertainmentby a half. To this end Entertainment Allowance should be cut by about 50?o,and the remaining half should go into the Mission Fund.Entertainment allowances were reduced by 10$ in 1976,&apos; andthe measures described under 17.1 - 17.5 above have alreadyproduced further economics. In consequence, the cost ofentertainment has fallen substantially behind the cost ofliving: for example, the entertainment -allowances of staffother than Heads of Mission cost  1.4 million in 1977/78,no more than they had 2 years previously despite substantialincreases in the cost of living.     The Government agreeWith the DEASC (paragraph 185) that it is neithernecessary nor useful to set arbitrary targets for cuts.But they will continue to monitor expenditure carefully, andto seek economies wherever possible.
Accommodation and OtherAdministration Overseas(Chanter 18 of the CPRS Review)DEASC ConclusionWc believe that owning diplomatic property is preferable in principle torenting and wc hope that the Government will press on towards the target oftwo-thirds ownership. We believe that the present operation of the TDR notonly hampers this objective but also causes a serious imbalance in the diplo-rnatic estate. This is because the rules are of&amp;n waived to allow purchase ofexpensive houses on a &apos;* needs &quot; basis, while ownership is generally encouragedm unstable countries and frustrated in stable ones. Standards of accommoda-tion should broadly reflect United Kingdom expectations, with the proviso thatoperational considerations, including the need to entertain at home, must betaken fully into account.  The level of official transport needs to be carefullyscrutinised but a small margin of safety in excess of normal everyday usage willoften have to be built into requirements to enable posts to respond flexibly tochanges in demand. Wc believe that, generally, the level of security is aboutright but that the I &quot;CO should continue to look for downgrading in theclassification of posts where possible. Wc welcome recent steps in this direc-tion. Wc do not favour the extension of &quot; sleeping watches &quot; but we think thatserving Forces personnel should be taken on as security officers where recruit-ing civilian staff is proving difficult. We do not agree with the proposal forreducing the use of the diplomatic radio, since it would have serious implica-tions for security. l&apos; .&apos; Estate management considerations should carry more weight in decisions0ui the diplomatic estate^M   Confiiderations are now taken fully into account in PCO/PSAs*0ns about the diplomatic estate.A balance must often behowever, between the ideal estate management solution andStated by operational, political or security requirements.sh0Ynce a cics&apos;rn for a new building has been agreed by the PSA and FCO it$hoi  0nty exceptionally be changed.

/8.3.  There should be greater delegation to posts overseas on accommodationA substantial measure of delegated authority exists, andthe levels are kept under review.   Cash limits have imposedrestraints in some areas.&apos;M.  There should be regular efficiency audits of estate management overseas bythe PSAA pilot study is being conducted by the PSA to establish thdneed and co3t-effectiveness of a system of efficiency audits.18.5.  The PSA should assume full responsibility for all the accommodation needsof posts overseas &apos; - . - -j.iThe appropriate division of responsibility between the PCOand PSA is still being studied by Ministers in the light ofcomments made by the CPR3 and DEASC (paragraphs 189-190of the latter&apos;3 report).(!* A few FCO staff should at any one time be seconded to the PSA* * *       Accepted
tt.7.iscounted cash flow analysis should continue to be used as a basis for decidingcr to buy (or build) or rent property overseas but different assumptionstenure and otrjer risks should be tested on each occasionAgreed, subject to the provisos that there will be cases whenacquisition must be made on the basis of need.In the short term it is unrealistic to think in terms of owningtwo-thirds of all residential property overseas.     Progresstowards increasing the owned proportion of the Estate willdepend on the application of investment appraisal case bycase, and on the availability of public funds.Greater use should be made of rent allowance hirings ^Where suitable rent allowance hirings are available theyare used. There are&apos; nonetheless practical advantages inkeeping a reasonable proportion of post hirings.Proposals should be drawn up to make a start on disposing of historic&quot;dings.  This programme should have a measure of priority over other claims&apos;new buildings &quot; &quot; ..Now current practice
Housing for staff, including-its location, should broadly reflect what theywould expect in .he UK &quot;Accommodation overseas must be tailored to the job and to&quot;the po3t, v/ith UK expectations being borne in mind.   Itsstandard should reflect various operational, environmentaland security factors which are absent or of only limitedrelevance in this country.our Accommoc,ation standards should be revised downwards to reflect inter ahato J?c.ommcndatioi?s on entertainment.   Revised standards should be submittedministers for approval within six monthsAccommodation standards are under review.Action should be taken to dispose of rented property which is above thcrcviscd standards. There should be a stocktaking review of progress in threeyearsOnce new standards have been adopted (see 18.12), existingholdings will be reviewed.7* The present policy of furnishing the reception rooms of accommodation ofrirst Secretaries and above to reflect the &quot; best of British design &quot; should beModified.  In future this aim should apply only to Heads of Posts&apos; residencesSee 18.12 above.
18.15.  Fewer official vehicles should be provided at posts overseas.  There shouldbe greater readiness to use private vehicles and public transport vThe number of official vehicles at Diplomatic Services postshas declined steadily in recent years, and the Inspectorslook carefully at transport requirements.   The point madeby the DEASC (paragraph 201) about maintaining a smallmargin is accepted.StatT overseas should be permitted to drive official vehicles thus makingpossible a reduction in the number of locally-engaged drivers \\Current practiceWhere British vehicles are provided for posts overseas their type should beoctcrniincd by export considerations. The FCO should consult the appropriateApartments     r&quot;.The primary considerations must be suitability for thejob, and servicing and spares support.   Export considerationsare taken into account. -
1818.  The practice of providing all staff of Grade 4 level and above with their own&quot;secretary should be discontinued.  There should be greater sharing of secretariesand greater readiness to use locally engaged staff      . &quot;We accept that secretarial support should be allocated onthe basis of the workload.    In general this at present meansthat staff of Grade 4 level and above have their ownsecretaries but where thi3 id not the case- we accept thatthere should be greater sharing of secretaries as is already-current practice with the junior grades.    Locally engagedsecretaries are used wherever appropriate.whhadeskPoffice0rrrSeaS COnSideratiQn shouId be *iven t0 co-locating Registry-Accepted.20.

Where security officers presently provide a 44 sleeping watch M considerationshould be given to replacing them with mission staff drawn from a rosterThe Government agree v/ith the DEASC (paragraph 203) thatthis suggestion has little merit since it would add furtherto the extra duties over and above the normal responsibilitiesalready required of the staff, and that its introductionwithout the full agreement of the staff (who are opposed toit) would be unid.se.
11.22. Security officers should be given training in measures to counter the terroristthreat v &apos;k    Now current practiceThere should be longer postings for security officers overseas &apos;The Government agree with the DEASC (paragraph 204) thatthere is little point in making a general change of thiskind designed to improve morale if as in this case it doesnot command the support of those concerned.

Organization Overseas(Chapter 19 of the CPRS Review)DEASCfs ViewThe Sub-Committee were not happy with thecriteria used by the CPRS in envisaging theclosure of up to 55 Missions and Posts.     Theythought that the most promising solution tothe problem of the deployment of residentrepresentation was to try to keep somerepresentation alive in countries with smallBritish interests but either to cut it tothe bone or to experiment with alternativeforms.     They considered that the mostPromising line of approach was the so-called&quot;Mini-Mission&quot; but were impressed by theEarnings sounded on all sides againstexpecting such missions to perform the sametasks as much larger posts.On the size of larger posts the Sub-Committeesaid (paragraph 217 of their report) that inthe end it was a question of whether one   hadfaith in the DS Inspectorate, in whose handsreally rested the ability of the DS torespond flexibly to changing conditions.They noted that the FCO had a good recordin comparison with other Whitehall Departmentsfor reducing manpower.and atiaim snou^ be to close approximately 2D missions in independent countries^ith   ]St ^ subordinate posts with UK-based staff and 10 subordinate postscentral   locallv engaged staff, taking into account proposals for market con-*uon exercises described in Chapter 6 &quot;.^ accepted.

In certain areas regional posts should be considered as an alternative to norepresentation or traditional multiple accreditation. The Development Divisionstn the Caribbean, Southern Africa and Commonwealth Pacific (if established) arcprime candidates for transformation into regional postsMultiple accreditation has its drawbacks.     Residentrepresentation by very small missions if often preferable*n some regions like the Eastern Caribbean, however, itmakes sense to concentrate representation as is beingdone at Bridgetown, Barbados.jo &quot; ____________ __^        ___L H.onorary British Trade Representatives should be appointed in some cotmlrirs,ino citiesNot accepted for the reasons given in 6.4.HA In countries where resident representation is justified by only one or tv...functions missions should restrict their capabilities and work to dealing with Uio.itfunctions alone; the only exceptions should be urgent consular protection workand minimal export promotion capability where that is not one of the primefunctionsAgreed, subject to local circumstances

The DEASC1S ViewThe Sub-Committee thought that the present system, onexamination, did not seem to work too badly in practice,for all its logical defects (paragraph 219 of D^ASCreport).An Oincial Committee on Bilateral Relations with Overseas Countries shouldbe established in the Cabinet Office, with the function, amongst others, of advisingMinisters on bilateral issues in which several departments have an interestWot accepted.   See para of the White Paper*?- Country Policy Programmes (CPP&apos;s) should be prepared inter-deparlmentallyln order to ensure that there is an agreed view about UK objectives and priorities[5 each c untry. Preparation of the CPPY would be supervised by the OfficialCommittee on Bilateral RelationsThe FCO is now preparing its Country Assessment Sheetsin collaboration with other interested Departments.On the Official Committee on Bilateral Relations^see 20.1,The Official Committee should be a neutral forum to which Heads of Postcould appeal if demands placed on them by departments in London were in-adcquately co-ordinated or inconsistent with the CPP&apos;s .See 20.1 above

Staffing(Chanter 21 of CPRS Review)DEASCVs ViewThe theme in the CPRS Report which led the teamto propose three options for alternative, staffingarrangements was that more specialisation wasrequired.     The Sub-Committee considered(paragraph 225 of their Report) that generally-speaking the weight of evidence they receivedwas in agreement with the CPRS, that there wasroom for some further degree of specialisationin overseas services.     The problem was todetermine how much.     They received much evidenceto the effect that specialist expertise in exportservices (to take a common example) as such wasnot necessarily the most crucial, but thatbusinessmen required briefing on the politicaland social, as well as the economic, backgroundto their activities.     The Sub-Committeeconcluded (paragraph 229) that specialisationwas desirable but was most effective if it couldbe developed alongside more general skills.They thought that the CPKSfs requirement thatthe same group of staff should perform both theBritish and the overseas ends of each representa-tional function was acceptable as a broad aimbut that a rigid application of the principlewould be likely to cause more harm than good.They strongly believed in improving communicationsbetween the Home Civil Service and the DiplomaticService but thought that hasty.institutionalreforms might do more harm than good.     Againstthis background they considered the threeoptionb (interchange, separate trade and aidservices, the Foreign Service Group) putforward by the CPRS.(a)   interchange - the Sub-Committee favouredthis option but were aware of the difficultyof ensuring exchange on a significantlygreater scale between the HCS and the DS.They attached importance to the promotionof exchanges between the DS and the DOT onthe one hand, and commerce and industry onthe other.     After hearing witnesses fromindustry and commerce they concluded(para 231) that the expansion of thesecondments system was a matter of someurgency./ (b)
(b) separate export promotion and aidadministration services - the Sub-Committee found (para 232) that therewas little if any support for thisoption among witnesses and that therewas a danger that a specialist aidservice might artificially separateaid from foreign policy considerations.(c) a Foreign Service Group (FSG) - theSub-Committee thought that thedisruption caused by moving to anFSG system and the probable difficulty   -inNfinding enough suitable recruitsoutweighed the advantages of thisoption.     They were included (para235) to endorse the DS Staff Side&apos;sverdict that &quot;no case for such aradical innovation had been made&quot;.Although not a formal option recommended by theCPRS, the Department of Overseas Affairs was  -also not favoured by the Sub-Committee.&apos;There should be more specialization in most of the functions of overseasstationSee paragraph 3^    of the White PaperTh,0ver$ cre should be the fullest possible interchangcability between those working&quot;as on a particular function.and those working on it in the UKCreased interchange between th.e Diplomatic Service^ Home Civil Service, as described in paragraphs 39-450* *he texx of the White Paper, will mean that more* will have experience of both ends of the work.
