SECTION I: INTRODUCTION1.1 This White Paper covers the period of the Danish Presidency ofthe Council of Ministers from 1 July to 31 December 1982.1.2 The period saw the completion of a decade of British member-ship of the European Community (EC). They have not been easy yearsfor Britain nor for Europe, but the Government is more than ever convincedthat Britain&apos;s interests are best promoted within the Community and thata strong and confident Community offers the greatest hope for Europe&apos;sfuture.1.3 Several Government Ministers made speeches in major Europeancities during the autumn to share with our partners British ideas on thefuture development of the Community. Among the particular topicscovered in these speeches were: the way forward for employment in theCommunity; the development of transport in Europe and its role incompleting the Community&apos;s internal market; trade in Europe and theWorld recession; information technology as a new sector for Europeaneconomic growth; urban policy in Europe and the British experience; theEuropean Community&apos;s regional policy; and an energy policy in anuncertain world. More general issues covered were: Britain, Denmarkand Europe; the European Community at the Crossroads; internationalinstitutions; riding the storm; and Europe-the British commitment.(Annex C contains a full list of speeches.) Themes from these speecheshave since been assembled in a booklet entitled &quot; Britain in the EuropeanCommunity-a Positive Approach&quot;,* which has been published in themajor European languages and circulated to Britain&apos;s Community partners.The booklet sets out British objectives within the Community, and proposespractical steps for achieving progress in a number of different areas ofpolicy. It demonstrates Britain&apos;s determination to play a positive andimaginative role within the European Community.1.4 Following the agreement of 30 May 1980 on the budget, theUnited Kingdom has received net budget refunds of some  1,500 millionin respect of 1980 and 1981. For 1982, the Council agreed in May 1982on a basic net refund of about another  500 million. The precise arrange-ments for paying the 1982 refunds were agreed by the Council on 26October 1982. Although the European Parliament rejected the Council&apos;sproposal for the necessary 1982 Supplementary and Amending Budget, theCouncil subsequently reaffirmed its commitment to the undertakings madeon 26 October and the Commission undertook to ensure that the UnitedKingdom was not as a result placed in a worse position than was thenintended.1.5 Work started on the arrangements for 1983 and later. The policyof Her Majesty&apos;s Government is, under the present budgetary system, tosecure substantial refunds for the United Kingdom and for the longerterm to seek the reform of the system with a view to ensuring that netcontributions from member states are equitable.   During the autumn,* Available from the Central Office of Information or from Information Department,Foreign and Commonwealth Office.4
British Ministers had bilateral discussions with the Commission and theother member states. A booklet explaining the nature of the budgetproblem was published in the main Community languages and distributedwidely in Europe. The Commission produced on 17 November a Com-munication proposing a lasting solution in the context of a new Communityfinancing system and a further refund arrangement for the next two, orpossibly, three, years following the pattern of the arrangements for 1980,1981 and 1982.   This Communication provides the basis for negotiation.1.6 The increasingly serious unemployment situation within the Com-munity was again a priority issue at meetings of the Standing EmploymentCommittee (26 October), the Labour and Social Affairs Councils (15November and 10 December) and the Joint Council of Economic, Financeand Employment Ministers (16 November). These meetings re-emphasisedthe link between action against unemployment and the need to strengthencompetitiveness and reduce inflation throughout the Community. TheJoint Council also reaffirmed the Community&apos;s commitment to ensure thatall young people entering the labour market receive training or jobexperience. In the United Kingdom this aim is being given effect throughthe Youth Training Scheme, to be introduced from September 1983.1.7 The Government supported the strict application of the anti-crisismeasures for the Community steel industry and for that reason welcomedmeasures to tighten up their application in all member states. The Govern-ment also supported the firm application of the terms of the State AidsDecision of 1981 (under which state aids to steel enterprises throughoutthe Community must cease by the end of 1985 with any aids paid in themeantime being strictly tied to capacity reductions). It will continue topress the Commission to ensure that all member states accept their propershare of the sacrifices involved and therefore welcomes the Commission&apos;sopening of procedures under the aids code.1.8 The Fisheries Council made considerable progress towards a settle-ment of the revised Common Fisheries Policy. Nine member states reachedagreement on a comprehensive package of measures to apply from 1 January1983; only Denmark was unable at that stage to endorse the agreement andsought further clarification.1.9 The United Kingdom continued to play an active part in negotiationson various Commission proposals for the protection or improvement of theenvironment. The dominant issue at the Environment Council on 3 and 17December was the question of Community action on the import of theproducts of harp and hooded seal pups. After extensive discussionunanimous agreement was reached on a wide-ranging resolution which willclose the main market for these products before the next cull. The Govern-ment is satisfied that these Community measures should meet the concernexpressed both by Parliament and the public that action be taken to preventtrade while doubts remain about the humanity and consequences of thecull. The Council will meet again on 28 February to review the need forfurther action in the light of a report from the Commission. The Councilalso agreed a Resolution approving the general approach of the ThirdCommunity Action Programme on the Environment for 1982-86.5
1.10 Following a Council Decision on 21 December, a one-year pilotphase intended to lay the foundation for a European Strategic Programmeof Research in Information Technology (ESPRIT) was established. TheGovernment attaches particular importance to ESPRIT which is seekingto establish a strategy for collaborative research in Information Technologyat the precompetitive stage. ESPRIT should enable Europe to developthe basic technologies which it needs to be competitive in world marketsin the medium to long term future.1.11 The Community reaffirmed its commitment, despite the morerelaxed oil market, to maintaining progress towards the Community&apos;s energypolicy objectives in reduced dependence on imported oil and the moreefficient use of energy. Substantial progress was made towards developinga coherent strategy to promote the role of solid fuels in the energy supplyof the Community.1.12 Political co-operation focussed on two subjects of particularimportance to the Ten, East-West relations and the Middle East. TheTen&apos;s discussions were aimed at co-ordinating a joint response to develop-ments and formulating a longer term approach.1.13 Further progress has been made in the accession negotiationswith Spain and more particularly with Portugal. But the process has beenmoving too slowly. The Government believe that it is politically importantboth for Spain and Portugal and for the Community that the applicantsshould enter as soon as possible, and they have been working to restoremomentum to the negotiations.1.14 On trade, the pressures of the recession have been making them-selves felt. But the Community has maintained-at the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Ministerial meeting and elsewhere-its firm,commitment to the open trading system, while acting where necessary torelieve unacceptable pressures on the system, including those resulting fromunfair trade, and to protect especially sensitive sectors of Communityindustry.1.15 Of particular importance were the consultations between theCommission and the Japanese Government under the first stage ofthe Community&apos;s action under GATT Article XXIII, aimed at opening theJapanese market further to imports of manufactures. The Foreign AffairsCouncil agreed on 31 December to proceed to the second stage, by seekingthe establishment of a Working Party of contracting parties to the GATTto investigate the EC&apos;s complaints.1.16 The Community also concluded, after prolonged negotiations, anAgreement with the United States to regulate carbon steel exports to theUnited States of America (USA) over a 3-year period, and played a fullpart in the negotiations with the USA which resulted in the lifting ofsanctions against Community companies involved in supplying equipmentfor the Siberian gas pipeline. Following the GATT Ministerial meetingthe Community and the US have agreed to study ways of reducing frictionin agricultural trade.6
1.17 The Development and Foreign Affairs Councils had first roundsof discussion on 8 and 22 November of the Commission&apos;s Memorandumon Community Development Policy. Guidelines were agreed on Communitymaintenance aid (see paragraph 3.15) and on Community development aidin relation to the situation of women in developing countries. A newFood Aid Management Regulation was agreed. The Government&apos;s viewson Community aid were among the subjects addressed in the address givenby the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs to theRoyal Commonwealth Society on 7 December 1982.SECTION II:  POLITICAL CO-OPERATIONPoland2.1 The Ten continued to consult closely on developments in Polandand the appropriate policy response. The European Council on 3-4December noted both the negative aspects of the situation, including thecontinued detention of a large number of persons, the continuation ofmartial law and the dissolution of Solidarity, and the positive aspects, inparticular the release of some detainees, including Mr. Walesa. They agreedthat the Ten would continue to follow developments closely, in particularthe effects of the suspension of martial law. Subsequently it was agreedin the Political Co-operation framework to recommend an extension of theCommunity measures adopted in early 1982.2.2 The European Council also emphasised that following the changeof leadership in the Soviet Union the relations of the Ten with thatcountry would continue to be based on the principles of firmness anddialogue. They called on the Soviet Union to make the necessary contri-butions to improve confidence in international affairs and expressed awillingness to respond positively to such efforts.2.3 The Presidency made representations on behalf of the Ten inMoscow in July and September concerning reductions in the telephoneservice between the Soviet Union and Community countries.Afghanistan2.4 The European Council on 3-4 December noted that the newSoviet leadership could make an important contribution to the improvementof relations by reassessing its position on Afghanistan. They recalled theEuropean Council proposal of 30 June 1981 for a comprehensive settle-ment, and expressed readiness to support any realistic efforts to achievea political solution.Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)2.5 The Ten resumed their close co-operation in the CSCE processwhen the review meeting in Madrid reconvened in November. Theycontinued to seek in good faith a satisfactory outcome in the form of asubstantive and balanced concluding document3145903 c*
Middle East2.6 The Ten continued to monitor developments in the Middle East.In a statement on 20 September Foreign Ministers of the Ten expressedtheir profound shock at the massacre of Palestinian civilians in Beirut. Theystated their willingness to support additional steps to ensure the safety ofcivilians and to assist in the relief and reconstruction of Lebanon. Theywelcomed the American initiative contained in President Reagan&apos;s speechof 1 September and underlined the importance of the statement adoptedby Arab heads of state and government at Fez on 9 September. Theyappealed to all parties to seize the opportunity to work towards a compre-hensive peace settlement.2.7 The Ten also agreed to maintain and expand their contacts withall parties. The President-in-office, Mr. Elleman-Jensen, visited Lebanon,Jordan and Israel on behalf of the Ten. Whilst in Israel, Mr. Elleman-Jensen expressed continuing European concern about Israeli policies inoccupied territories which the Ten regard as both illegal and an obstacleto peace.2.8 The European Council of 3-4 December expressed disappointmentat the delay in seizing the political opportunity created by the Americaninitiative and the Fez declaration and called on all parties to assume theirinternational responsibilities without further hesitation. They called for awithdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon. They also reiterated thewillingness of the Ten to contribute to a solution by their support of theUN forces and observers, the participation by some of their number inthe Multi-national Force and by the continued provision of aid.2.9 The Ten continued to follow closely the conflict opposing Iran andIraq. They agreed that there was no direct role for the Ten or the West,who could best help by supporting those already active in the field intheir efforts towards securing a just and acceptable settlement.SECTION III:   ENLARGEMENT, EXTERNAL RELATIONS,TRADE AND AIDEnlargement3.1 Good progress was made in the accession negotiations with Portugalwith agreement reached on the Customs Union and Rights of Establishmentchapters, and also on the Taxation and External Relations chapters, althoughthere were some outstanding points. On Agriculture, technical talks wereheld with Portugal, but although several statements were made by bothparties, no declarations were exchanged. No new chapters were agreedin full with Spain but good progress was made on technical aspects of theCustoms Union and Taxation chapters.East-West Economic Relations3.2 As a result of discussions in Washington between representativesof the seven Economic Summit countries and of the Presidency and8
Commission, agreement was reached to set in motion, and where appropriateto continue, studies on aspects of East-West economic relations. The Com-munity has agreed to participate in these studies and the Commission andPresidency are preparing a paper on the procedure for Communityparticipation.United Nations Law of the Sea Convention (UNLOSC)3.3 The Foreign Affairs Council discussed Community signature ofthe UN Law of the Sea Convention but no decision was reached. Fivemember states (France, Ireland, Denmark, Greece, Netherlands) signedthe Convention when it opened for signature in Jamaica on 10 December.European Free Trade Association (EFTA)3.4 Agreement was reached to simplify the EC/EFTA Rules of Origin.Meetings were held in December between the Community and Austria,Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, Norway and Iceland on a wide range oftrade issues under the terms of the individual EC/EFTA Agreements.General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)3.5 The Community played a full part both in preparations for andat the GATT Ministerial Meeting at the end of November. The meetingsaw agreement on a commitment by Signatories to maintain the existingobligations in the GATT which have underpinned the open trade systemsince the war. It also provided for various studies including agriculturaltrade issues; the problems of international trade in services; and tradebetween developed and developing countries. The meeting also agreed onimprovements to the GATT dispute settlement procedure.Textiles3.6 The Community agreed to stay in the third Multi-Fibre Arrange-ment for the whole of its term up to July 1986. Negotiations for newbilateral agreements to take effect from 1 January 1983 continued, andagreements were concluded with 25 supplying countries. Argentina didnot conclude a new agreement and the Community agreed to impose aunilateral limitation on Argentine textile imports. It also agreed onunilateral measures, as before, in respect of Taiwan.Generalised Scheme of Preferences3.7 The Community&apos;s Generalised Scheme of Preferences for developingcountries was reviewed and some adjustments were made to the 1982Scheme. Regulations for the 1983 scheme were adopted by the Councilof Ministers on 8 December 1982 and will come into operation on 1 January1983.Poland3.8 On 22 December the Council agreed to the disbursement of afurther 9.5 million ecu (about  5.4 million) in humanitarian aid channelleddirect to the Polish people through voluntary agencies.93145903 c*2
Soviet Union3.9 On 22 December the Council agreed a Regulation renewing forone year the restrictions agreed in March on the import of certain Sovietmanufactured and luxury goods by the Community. The restrictions areto be reviewed in the course of 1983.Argentina3.10 Following the lifting of the Community ban on imports fromArgentina on 22 June the Community proposed to the Argentine govern-ment on 29 October the reciprocal lifting of all remaining restrictions oncivil commercial relations between them. The Argentines replied on18 November welcoming the Community&apos;s desire to regularise its economicand commercial relations with Argentina expressing readiness to holdimmediate talks with the appropriate Community authorities and invitingthe Community and its member states to exchange information on anyrelevant discriminatory restrictions. On 21 December the Communityresponded by expressing its readiness to continue contacts with the Argentineauthorities with a view to bringing about rapid and complete normalisationof economic and trade relations. The Community also stated that this mustinclude the reciprocal lifting of the mutual import ban still in force betweenArgentina and the United Kingdom and the removal of measures still inforce against British companies operating in Argentina.Japan3.11 Against the background of continuing concern at the Community&apos;sdeficit on visible trade with Japan, the Commission held three rounds ofconsultations with the Japanese Government in pursuit of its case underthe GATT dispute settlement procedure. As part of this case, the Com-mission presented to the Japanese a list requesting, inter alia, concessionsin tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade. Fifteen of the EC&apos;s requests werecovered in a package of import liberalisation measures announced by theJapanese Government at the end of December. The Council agreed at itsmeeting on 13 December on a number of measures, including recourse tothe next stage of the GATT dispute settlement procedure, pursuing theCommunity&apos;s list of requests and seeking assurances of moderation by theJapanese of exports in sensitive sectors. In addition the Commission willprolong and when necessary extend the system of surveillance of Japaneseimports and initiate safeguard investigations, when so requested by memberstates.United States of America3.12 Efforts continued to settle the threat to the transatlantic steel tradeposed by the US steel industry&apos;s wide range of anti-dumping and counter-vailing suits against carbon steel exports from the United Kingdom andother Community member states. Negotiations by the Commission resultedin an Arrangement reached with the US on 21 October to limit exportsin return for the withdrawal by US industry of the various anti-dumpingand countervailing suits. The Arrangement will run for three years. TheCommunity maintained its strong response to the attempt by the US10
Administration to make European subsidiaries and licensees of US com-panies subject to sanctions if they supplied equipment for the Siberian gaspipeline. The Community&apos;s objections to the claims to extraterritorialjurisdiction implicit in this decision, and its effects on existing contracts,were made clear in a detailed Note given to the State Department duringAugust. Eventually the US sanctions were lifted on 13 November. Frictionbetween the US and the Community over agricultural trade became acutein the period before and at the GATT Ministerial meeting in November.Following high-level talks in Brussels on 10 December, the Community andthe US agreed on the need to avoid a trade war in agriculture and to studyways of reducing this friction.Romania3.13 The second meeting of the Joint Committee established under theEC/Romania agreements was held in Bucharest on 2-3 December. TheJoint Committee had a useful discussion on the development of trade betweenthe Community and Romania.Community Development Policy3.14 Both the Development Council and the Foreign Affairs Councilconsidered the Commission&apos;s Memorandum on Community DevelopmentPolicy. The general objectives were supported (the promotion of internallygenerated development, emphasis on food security through rural develop-ment and the promotion of human resources, and special attention to theneeds of the poorest), while other proposals, notably a fixed aid target,funding the European Development Fund through the Community Budgetand formal co-ordination between member states in international financialinstitutions were rejected. Further discussion is expected to centre on aspectsof the Memorandum having a bearing on the renegotiation of the SecondLome Convention.Community Aid Guidelines3.15 At the meeting of the Development Council on 8 November,Ministers agreed guidelines for future maintenance aid (aid directed tomaintaining the productive capacity of particular sectors in developingcountries). Guidelines were also agreed on the application of Communityaid to the special problems of women in developing countries.Food Aid3.16 The Council also agreed a new Food Aid Management Regulationwhich should improve and accelerate procedures for providing this type ofaid. At the same time a supplementary cereals programme of 72,337tonnes was approved. The Development Council agreed in November toadd Rwanda to those countries (Kenya, Mali and Zambia) receivingsupport from the Community for their national food strategies.Relief and Reconstruction Aid3.17 The Community has provided special assistance to Lebanon inthe form of 10 million ecu (nearly  6 million) of emergency relief aid and50 million ecu (nearly  29 million) of European Investment Bank (EIB)resources for reconstruction.11
SECTION IV:   AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIEStMonetary Arrangements4.1 In October adjustments were agreed to the representative rates forFrance, Belgium and Luxembourg in order to bring the representative ratefor France more closely into line with the central rate to realign fully therepresentative and central rates for Belgium and Luxembourg. For mostproducts the marketing year 1982/83 had already begun and the newrepresentative rates will not be applied until 1983.Cereal Substitutes4.2 The Agriculture Council on 19 July approved an agreement withThailand on manioc production, marketing and trade. On the same dayan agreement with Indonesia (the principal GATT Contracting Party) wasapproved which enabled tariff quotas to be imposed on other GATTsignatories.Wine4.3 Agreement was reached at the Agriculture Council on 19-20 Julyto a package of amendments to the wine regime ahead of Spanish andPortuguese accession. These included new provisions on compulsorydistillation and on disposal of the alcohol produced.Sheepmeat4.4 On 21 December the Council adopted a Regulation concerning theimport arrangements for 1983 of sheep and sheepmeat from those thirdcountries which had not entered into voluntary restraint agreements withthe EC.Butter-New Zealand4.5 At the October Agriculture Council an agreement was reachedwhich entitled the United Kingdom to import 87,000 tonnes of New Zealandbutter in 1983 at a reduced import levy. As a Council regulation implement-ing the agreement could not be adopted by the end of 1982 because ofreserves by France and the Irish Republic, on 13-14 December the Counciladopted a Regulation which enabled the United Kingdom to import inJanuary 1983 one-twelfth of the agreed quantity.Animal Health and Welfare4.6 The arrangements for controlling imports of cattle and pigs intoGreat Britain and cattle, pigs and meat into Northern Ireland to protectlivestock against foot and mouth disease and swine vesicular disease underDirectives 64/432 and 72/461 were due to expire on 31 December 1982.The Agriculture Council on 14 December 1982 agreed to an extension ofthese arrangements for a further year.4.7 In July, the European Court ruled (case 40/82) that the controlson imports of poultry meat and eggs into Great Britain, in support of theUnited Kingdom&apos;s policy on Newcastle Disease, were too restrictive. How-ever the Court acknowledged that import restrictions of a less demandingnature were justified to safeguard the health of the national poultry flock.12
Following discussions with the Commission and interested member states,the Government introduced a revised regime in October which permittedthe resumption of trade while safeguarding poultry health in this country.Trade was resumed with France in November and with the Netherlandsin December.4.8 In July the Agriculture Council discussed two Commission docu-ments (as amended) for a directive laying down minimum standards forthe protection of laying hens kept in battery cages.Fisheries-Internal4.9 In October all member states except Denmark accepted a fullrange of measures including those covering conservation, total allowablecatches, catch quotas, and access to fishing grounds. Failing Denmark&apos;sacceptance at the Fisheries Council on 21 December the Commission issueda declaration calling upon member states to notify it without delay of theinterim national measures they intended to adopt in the collective interest.The United Kingdom made seven statutory instruments which gave effectto measures based on the Commission&apos;s proposals on which the nine memberstates had agreed. These were notified immediately to the Commission.They covered access to United Kingdom coastal waters by Danish vessels,access to the coastal waters of other member states by United Kingdomvessels, access by all member states to a conservation area off the northof Scotland and a ban on fishing for the western mackerel stock withinBritish fishery limits by Danish vessels. On technical conservation measuresthe new orders resulted in several changes to the national measures previouslyoperating, including amendments to the rules governing beam trawlingwithin 12 miles of United Kingdom baselines, the minimum size provisionsfor Irish Sea cod, and the minimum mesh sizes when fishing for certainprawns. Agreement was reached on the renewal of the interim schemeof grant aid for inshore fishing vessels and aquaculture and on guide pricesfor 1983.Fisheries-External4.10 The negotiations on reciprocal fishing arrangements for 1983 withNorway, Sweden, Spain and the Faroes commenced. Discussions alsotook place with certain West African countries resulting in fishery agree-ments being concluded with Guinea Conakry and Guinea Bissau.Grants for Marketing and Processing4.11 In November, the Agriculture Council agreed to extend for afurther two years the Regulations which provide aid for projects whichimprove the marketing and processing of agricultural and fisheries products. jThe scheme will continue unchanged until the end of 1984, with 140million ecu (about  80 million) available to be allocated each year through-out the Community, and an additional 8 million ecu (nearly  5 million)for the West of Ireland for the two year period. It was also agreed toallocate an additional 32 million ecu (about  18 million) to provide forGreek projects to be paid at the higher rate of grant which now appliesto the Mezzogiorno.13
Tractors4.12 As part of the removal of technical barriers to trade under Article100 of the Treaty of Rome the Community is adopting a series of Directivesto harmonise the characteristics and components of agricultural and forestrywheeled tractors. The Directives would cover Community production oftractors with design speeds between 6 kilometres per hour (kph) and30 kph. This would enable United Kingdom manufacturers to rationalisetheir production arrangements and would facilitate exports to other memberstates.European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)4.13 During 1982, under the Guarantee Section of the EAGGF, UnitedKingdom receipts were  718 million, compared with  605 million theprevious year. Receipts during the last half of 1982 amounted to  428million with the main areas of benefit being payments for export refundson cereals, milk and beef, oil seed production aids, cereals storage, skimmedmilk aids, butter subsidies and sheepmeat premiums.4.14 United Kingdom receipts from the Guidance Section of EAGGFamounted to  42 million in 1982 and  63 million in 1981. During thelast half of 1982, receipts amounted to  33 million with  6 million fordirect (project type) measures,  6 million for non-marketing of milk and 21 million for indirect (structural) measures.SECTION V:ECONOMIC, MONETARY AND BUDGETARY QUESTIONSFinance Council Business5.1 . Finance Ministers continued their regular reviews of the economicsituation in the Community. On 12 July the Finance Council agreed toadopt the fifth medium-term economic policy programme, which set outbroad economic objectives for the member states to follow.5.2 On 15 November the Finance Council resumed discussion on invest-ment promotion and the Commission presented its proposal for a Councildecision to authorise a further tranche of about  1,650 million under theNew Community Instrument.5.3 The Finance Council on 17 December adopted the Annual Reporton the economic situation and approved economic policy guidelines for1983. The Report was pessimistic on the immediate outlook for memberstates&apos; economies. The Council also considered the Commission&apos;s paper onbudget discipline which it had first looked at in July. The Council alsoconsidered the implications of the European Parliament&apos;s rejection of the1982 supplementary and amending budget (see paragraphs 5.6 and 5.10).5.4 Finance Ministers also held a joint Council with EmploymentMinisters on 16 November (see paragraph 8.3).14
Budgetary Questions1981 Refunds5.5 The United Kingdom received the balance of its entitlement torefunds for 1981 under the Budget Agreement of 30 May 1980. Grosspayments totalling some 348 million ecus (about  198 million) were made tothe United Kingdom, thus raising the cumulative total of such receipts sincethe conclusion of the Agreement to  1,810 million. After allowing for theUnited Kingdom&apos;s contributions to these refunds under the own resourcesfinancing arrangements, the comparable net value of these refund receiptsamounts to some  1,500 million.1982 Refunds5.6 On 26 October Foreign Ministers reached agreement on the meansof implementing the Agreement on the United Kingdom&apos;s refunds for 1982reached on 24-25 May. It was agreed that our basic refund of 850 millionecus (some  490 million) net should be met from the 1982 budget and paidto us before the end of December. On 16 December, the Parliament rejectedthe 1982 Supplementary and Amending Budget which made provision forthis refund, as they considered that a definitive solution to the problem ofbudgetary imbalances should have been reached. However, the FinanceCouncil agreed on the following day to respect the commitments in theAgreement of 26 October, and the Commission undertook to take steps toensure that the United Kingdom and Germany would not be put in a worseposition than intended under that Agreement. The texts of the CouncilAgreements of 26 October and 17 December are reproduced in Annex D.1983 and Later5.7 On 25 May, the Foreign Affairs Council had agreed to take decisionsby the end of November on the budget solution for 1983 and later. TheCommission put forward its proposals in a Communication to the Councilon 17 November. It proposed that the United Kingdom should receiverefunds for a further two, or possibly three, years on the pattern of thosefor 1980, 1981 and 1982. During this period, the Commission proposed awide-ranging review of the Community&apos;s financing systems, and said that itwas in the context of a new financing system that the British budget problemshould eventually be solved.5.8 Foreign Ministers had a first exchange of views on the Commissionpaper on 22 November and agreed to discuss it again at their Januarymeeting. In the meantime, they instructed the Committee of PermanentRepresentatives to set to work rapidly on the issues posed by the Commissionpaper. IPreliminary Draft Supplementary and Amending BudgetNo. 1 for 19825.9 At the Budget Council of 28 July the Council decided not toproceed with the Commission&apos;s Preliminary Draft proposals on the groundsthat, for the more urgent proposals, transfers of appropriations (possible153145903 d*
because there was underspending on some budget headings) were moreappropriate. The Commission accordingly presented a composite transferwhich effectively dealt with the more urgent proposals, principally increasesin the provision for the Social Fund, contained in its Preliminary Draftproposals. In October the Council agreed to total transfers of about 135 million.Preliminary Draft Supplementary and Amending BudgetNo. 2 for 19825.10 On 5 November a Preliminary Draft Supplementary and AmendingBudget No. 2 for 1982 was forwarded by the Commission to the Council andthe Parliament. This provided among other proposals for payments to theUnited Kingdom of 1,092 million ecus (about  631 million) and to Germanyof 210 million ecus (about  121 million). These payments would betranslated into expenditure on Community policies in the United Kingdomand Germany under appropriate regulations. On 8 November the Councilestablished this as Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget No. 1 for1982. However on 16 December, as noted above (see paragraph 5.6) theParliament rejected the draft.1983 budget5.11 In June the Commission presented a Preliminary Draft Budgetcontaining its proposals for the 1983 Budget. The Budget Council held on27-28 July established a Draft Budget for 1983 after agreeing that higherprovision for the Social Fund and the Regional Development Fund shouldbe major priorities. The Parliament then proposed certain amendmentsand modifications to the Draft. When the Budget Council considered themon 22 November, it agreed to some increase compared with the Draft whichit had established in July, particularly in respect of the Social Fund andthe Regional Development Fund. The Parliament responded by proposinga second set of amendments at their second reading which they voted toadopt on 16 December. After further consideration the Council informed thePresident of the Parliament on the following day that the Council couldaccept the Parliament&apos;s amendments in full. This completed the Budgetaryprocedure and the President of the Parliament declared the 1983 Budgetadopted on 21 December.Customs Union5.12 By the end of August all member states had agreed to end reliefsfrom customs duties and agricultural levies on third Country goods importedby intra-Community travellers, in accordance with the Commission&apos;sinterpretation of the European Court judgment in the German &quot; Butterships &quot;case. The new arrangements were to begin on 1 January 1983. Contrary tothe Court judgment, however, the Germans did not agree to abolish theexemption from VAT and excise duties on goods sold on board theButterships.5.13 In October the European Court was asked for a preliminary rulingon three questions concerning the legality of duty-free sales of goods on16
ferries after the plaintiff in the original &quot; Butterships &quot; case had returned tothe German courts with a new action.Export Credit5.14 The new export credit terms, agreed by participants in the OECDConsensus (International Agreement on Guidelines for Officially SupportedExport Credits) which includes the Community, became effective from6 July 1982. A Council Decision was adopted on 27 July 1982 to extendthe application of the OECD Understanding on export credits for ships until31 January 1983.SECTION VI:  REGIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL AFFAIRSEuropean Coal and Steel Community (ECSC): Loans6.1 The ECSC made loans totalling  12 million under Article 56 ofthe Treaty of Paris, making a total of  24 million during 1982. Thisfollowed applications from United Kingdom companies in respect of projectscreating employment opportunities for steel and coal workers affected byrestructuring of the industries.   Further loans were under negotiation.6.2 The Commission set aside nearly  20 million for re-adaptationbenefits, bringing the total for 1982 up to  64 million. These are to bepaid to United Kingdom redundant steelworkers under Article 56(2) of theTreaty of Paris. The amount set aside will help to fund schemes for earlyretirement, retraining and income support, administered by the Departmentof Industry.European Investment Bank (EIB): Loans6.3 EIB foreign currency loans granted to the United Kingdom overthe period totalled  56 million, of which  12 million were loaned to privateindustry in the Assisted Areas, with the balance being taken up by thepublic sector for telecommunications, transport, water supply and sewerageprojects. The corresponding amounts for 1982 as a whole were  194million and  24 million respectively.European Regional Development Fund6.4 The changes in the extent of the United Kingdom Assisted Areaslast August have resulted in a concentration of aid within the UnitedKingdom on those areas which are most in need of assistance. The sizeof the Fund for 1982 was about  994 million, of which  859 million wasspecifically set aside for the quota section. In the United Kingdom&apos;sallocations from the Fund for 1982 grants totalling some  250 million wereallocated to 606 infrastructure and 47 industrial projects in the UnitedKingdom. Whilst we continue to benefit from the first round of Non-Quota measures for 1981-1985, for which the United Kingdom was allocated 32 million, the Commission has proposed a second round, which wouldgive the United Kingdom a further  85 million for a second five-year period.By the end of 1982, the United Kingdom is set to have received  1 billionfrom the Fund since its inception in 1975.173145903 D*2
Steel6.5 In September, the Foreign Affairs Council agreed to the paymentby transfer from the European Community to the ECSC budget, of 100million ecus (about  57 million) for social measures in the period 1982/83,bringing the total payments for social measures so far to 212 million ecus(about  121 million).6.6 In November, at an informal meeting of Industry Ministers theCommission announced measures to reinforce the application of the anti-crisis policy intended to restore stability to the steel industry which includedthe production quota regime imposed under Article 58 of the Treaty ofParis. Also in November the Commission opened a large number ofprocedures under Article 8(3) of the State Aids Decision (2320/81/ECSC)involving aids in all member states except Denmark.iShipbuilding6.7 The 5th Directive (81/363/EEC) on aid to shipbuilding expired on31 December. The European Commission proposed that it should beextended without amendment for three years, since, in the present continuingeconomic crisis, no genuine recovery in the maritime industries, either atworld or at Community levels, was foreseen in the medium-term. TheCouncil agreed a two year extension on 21 December.Information Technology6.8 On 21 December a Council Decision was taken establishing a oneyear pilot phase intended to lay the foundation for a European StrategicProgramme of Research in Information Technology (ESPRIT). The pilotphase, for which 11.5 million ecus (nearly  7 million) of Community fundshave been allocated in 1983, will consist of collaborative, industriallyorien(ed projects on selected information technology research topics. Theprogress made in the pilot phase will help determine the approach to amajor programme of this nature.Science and Technology Research6.9 On 4 November Ministers responsible for research met to considerdevelopments in the field of science and technology since the last ResearchCouncil in June. Issues discussed were: the Commission&apos;s proposals fora European strategic programme of research and development in informa-tion technology; the reorientation of the work programme of the Com-munity&apos;s Joint Research Centre; stimulating the Community&apos;s scientific andtechnical potential; Council recommendations on telecommunications; anda research programme in the field of science and technology for development.A 5_ year research and development programme for a machine translationsystem of advanced design was adopted at a cost of 16 million ecus (about 9 million). The aim is to create a computer aided translation systemcapable of dealing with all the official languages of the Community, whichwould be of benefit not only to the Community but also to industrygenerally.18???????????????a
-   .   . 6.10  On 3 December the Council adopted a four year (1983-86) researchand development programme in the field of science and technology fordeveloping at a cost of 40 million ecus (about  23 million) with theaim of helping developing countries by supporting and reinforcing scientificactivities in the areas of tropical agriculture, and medicine, health andnutrition in the tropics.6.11 On 21 December the Council adopted a five year (1983-87)research and development programme in the field of applied metrologyand reference materials aimed at harmonising measurement methodsCommunity-wide so as to achieve compatibility of measurements at acost of 25 million ecus (about  14 million).Medical and Public Health Research6.12 On 17 August the Ministers responsible for research adopted afive year (1982-86) concerted action research and development programmein the field of medical and public health research. It comprises threesub-programmes: health problems; health resources; and personal environ-ment (nutrition and pharmaceuticals). The total cost of the work involvedis 13.3 million ecus (about  7.6 million).Company and Securities Law6.13 Negotiations began on the draft directive on the prospectus to bepublished when securities are offered for subscription or sale to the public.Negotiations continued on a number of other draft instruments: thosedealing with the accounts of groups of companies, the qualifications ofauditors, collective investment funds (unit trusts), the proposal to establishthe European Co-operation Grouping and the draft European BankruptcyConvention. The Directive on the division of public companies (&quot; scissions &quot;)was adopted.6.14 The Commission announced that it was revising the draft fifthdirective (on the structure of public companies including worker participa-tion) in the light of the European Parliament&apos;s Opinion.Insurance6.15 Work continued on the draft directive to facilitate the freedom toprovide insurance services throughout the Community. Little progress wasmade on the main provisions of the directive and a number of fundamentalobstacles to agreement remained.Industrial Property6.16 Work continued on the litigation arrangements needed to implementthe Community Patent Convention. In connection with the proposed regu-lation to establish a Community trade mark system and the Councildirective to approximate trade mark law of member states, the CouncilWorking Group on Intellectual Property (Trade Marks) met in September andDecember to continue its discussion on the technical content of theproposals.19
pSECTION VII: ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORTEnvironmental Issues7.1 The Environment Council met on 3 December and 17 December.On both occasions the principal item discussed was a range of proposalsrelating to the import into the Community of the products of harp andhooded seal pups. The Council agreed on a Resolution to close theCommunity market for these products before the next cull. Member stateshave undertaken to adopt all measures necessary to prevent such imports.The Commission has been instructed to undertake a comprehensiveexamination of all aspects of the cull and to explore proposals put forwardby Canada for the international management of seals. The Council willmeet again on 28 February to review the need for further action in thelight of a report from the Commission.7.2 A Resolution approving the general approach of the ThirdCommunity Action Programme on the Environment for 1982-86 was agreed.Both the draft directive on the environmental assessment of developmentprojects and the draft directive on discharges of cadmium into the aquaticenvironment were discussed; both proposals were referred to the Committeeof Permanent Representatives for further discussion.Inland Transport7.3 The Transport Council met once, on 16 December, and discusseda long agenda of inland transport issues. Agreement in principle was reachedon a regulation allowing 10 million ecus (nearly  6 million) to be spenton transport infrastructure projects in the Community. There was alsoagreement in principle to a mandate for the Commission to negotiateimproved arrangements with certain non-Community countries for inter-national coach services; and to some minor changes to the multi-lateralroad haulage quotas. The Council also discussed a proposal to facilitatecross-frontier traffic; a proposal to liberalise international furniture removals;the need for improved international railway co-operation; progress in theCommunity&apos;s negotiations with Austria on transport problems; weights anddimensions of heavy goods vehicles; road haulage tariffs; and transportinfrastructure. Work on these subjects would continue at official level.Shipping7.4 The Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control adoptedat the European Conference on Maritime Safety in January came into forceon 1 July. Its aim is to establish a harmonised and co-ordinated systemfor the inspection of merchant ships visiting Community and other Europeanports. The United Kingdom expects to achieve the agreed inspection rateof 25 per cent of visiting ships within the first year of operation. TheCommission has suspended examination of its proposals for enforcinginternational maritime conventions on safety and pollution prevention withinthe Community until experience has been gained of the operation of theMemorandum of Understanding.20
7.5 The activities of Eastern bloc carriers in Central American, EastAfrican and Far East trades continued to be monitored and examined byCouncil Working Groups, and the Council agreed to maintain this monitoringuntil the end of 1984.7.6 Negotiations continued in a Council Working Group on a draftregulation applying the competition rules in the EEC Treaty of Rome toshipping. The Danish Presidency proposed a set of major amendmentswhich would provide for a two-tier regime, with tighter control over theactivities of shipping conferences where fair and effective competition hadbeen restricted.Civil Aviation7.7 Discussion continued in the Council on draft directives on air faresand the liberalisation of intra-Community regional air services; and on adraft regulation for the application of the competition rules of the EECTreaty of Rome to air transport. The Commission continued its consultationwith member states&apos; experts and interested outside bodies in the Communityon express low weight air cargo, non-scheduled air services, and a directiveon transparency of financial relations between Governments and publiclyowned air transport undertakings. The Commission completed its consul-tations with member states&apos; experts on state aids to airlines and announceits intention to begin consultations on state aids to airports.SECTION VIII: SOCIAL AFFAIRSInformal Meeting of Employment Ministers8.1 Employment Ministers met informally in Copenhagen on 27-28September to prepare for the Standing Employment Committee on26 October and the Joint Council of Economic, Finance and EmploymentMinisters (Jumbo) on 16 November. Discussions at the informal meeting(on 27-28 September) also covered re-organisation of working time andspecial employment and training initiatives, particularly for young people.Employment8.2 On 26 October the Standing Committee on Employment met inBrussels to prepare further for the November Joint Council. The meetingconsidered a Commission Communication dealing with working time andwith the integration of young people into the labour market.8.3 After a further preparatory Social Affairs Council on 15 November,the Joint Council met on 16 November to consider the issues mentionedabove together with a report on the economic and social situation. TheCouncil emphasised that the way to increase employment was by strengthenedcompetitive capacity and profitability allied to further reductions in inflationand interest rates. The Council reaffirmed its commitment to ensure thatall young people entering the labour market be given the opportunity of21
vocational training or job experience. There was also agreement that incertain circumstances a reduction in working time could help improveemployment, particularly if more flexible use was made of the meansof production.8.4 The Labour and Social Affairs Council met in Brussels on10 December and agreed to prolong the life of the existing European SocialFund until the current review of the Fund was completed. The Councilalso stressed the importance which it attached to rapid completion of thereview.8.5 The Council also agreed a Resolution on vocational training andnew technology, subject to the views of the European Parliament and theEconomic and Social Committee. The draft directive on protection ofworkers from the risks of exposure to asbestos was also discussed, but it wasnot possible to reach complete agreement. The Secretary of State forEmployment stressed the positive action that had already been taken by theUnited Kingdom in this area and urged the Council to conclude its workon the directive as soon as possible. Other subjects discussed were thedraft directives on part-time and temporary work. The Council&apos;s discussionsof social security matters are recorded in paragraphs 8.3 and 8.9.European Social Fund Allocations8.6 In October the Commission announced the fourth set of SocialFund allocations for 1982, bringing the total United Kingdom allocation for1982 so far to  228 million. The following table shows how the UnitedKingdom allocations were distributed between the various &quot; fields ofintervention &quot;-  millionYoung People ............... 131Regions .................. 56Handicapped ............... 23Migrants ............... 10Technical Progress ............ 4Textiles .................. 3Women ...............

Discussions took place atofficial level and will continue in 1983.22
Social Security8.8 The Labour and Social Affairs Council met on 10 December andformally adopted a Recommendation establishing principles to guide memberstates in the introduction of flexible retirement age policies. The Councilalso adopted a programme of medium term projections of social expenditureand its financing for the period 1982-85, which had been agreed in principleat the May meeting.The Anti-Poverty Programme8.9 The Council also adopted conclusions on the Commission reporton the first programme to combat poverty. It recognised the need for furtheraction at the Community level to combat poverty and invited the Commissionto submit further proposals along suggested guidelines, without prejudice tothe positions which member countries, including the UK, might adopt towardssuch proposals.SECTION IX: ENERGY9.1 At the Energy Council on 13 July, Ministers discussed recentdevelopments in the energy markets and reviewed the progress made byall member states in reducing dependence on imported oil and in moreefficient use of energy. The Council reaffirmed this strategy and saw noevidence that the more relaxed oil market was leading to any slackeningof effort towards achieving the Community&apos;s agreed goals.9.2 The Council also adopted Recommendations on further efforts toachieve a more rational use of energy, including arrangements for theCommission to monitor progress. These Recommendations emphasisedthe importance of applying sound energy pricing policies. The Council alsounderlined its conviction that nuclear energy could make a greater contribu-tion to the electricity needs of the Community benefiting industry throughlower costs. Finally it agreed to make a fresh attempt to devise a Com-munity strategy for coal.9.3 At its meeting on 9 November, the Energy Council made substantialprogress towards developing a comprehensive strategy for promoting therole of solid fuels in the Community and concluded that a firm politicalwill existed lo pursue this objective. Ministers decided to conduct athorough discussion of Community support for economic coal production,transportation and use at a special meeting of Energy Ministers.9.4 The November Energy Council endorsed the findings of a studyon member states&apos; ability to cope with interruptions in gas supplies. Workwill continue to explore further possibilities for collaboration betweenmember states. Studies will be made of the adequacy of the Community&apos;sgas transport system and into the prospects for exploiting deep gas in theCommunity.23
9.5 Further progress was made on new draft regulations for the energydemonstration projects scheme. The United Kingdom supported theextension of this scheme, but stressed the need for the Council to retainfirm management control, and for appropriate financial mechanisms.9.6 The Council began consideration of a Commission proposal forinterest rate subsidies on loans for certain classes of investment-districtheating, conversion to coal, coal handling equipment, and generation ofenergy from waste.9.7 The Commission withdrew a draft directive changing the basis forcalculating the level of obligatory oil stocks: in its place the Energy Councilagreed to consider a political commitment to make an equivalent change,except where consumption had declined because of long-term changes inoil use. This commitment would not require any change in the presentobligations on United Kingdom companies.9.8 The Council also endorsed an interim report on energy pricingwithin the Community, and the principles behind a Directive on substitutefuels in petrol. A Directive on efficiency testing of heat generators wasagreed.9.9 Energy Ministers also held an informal meeting in Copenhagen, on16 December, to discuss the possible elements of a Community solid fuelpolicy. The meeting accepted that there was a common interest in progresstowards a balanced and comprehensive Community strategy for solid fuelsand the Ministers agreed to consider proposals from the Commission coveringthe promotion of solid fuel use, the handling and transport of coal, cokingcoal, the modernisation and rationalisation of coal production, the problemof stocks, intra-Community trade in solid fuels, trade with third countries,environmental questions related to coal, and research, development anddemonstration.Receipts from the Community9.10 During 1982 the United Kingdom received from ECSC  5-2million in grants for Coal Research and Development and  4 million forreadaption aid for miners, the corresponding figures for the last six monthsof 1982 were  2-2 million and  1 million respectively. The EuropeanRegional Development fund paid grants totalling  11 million for electricityand gas projects in the United Kingdom,  7 million of which was duringthe last six months. In addition,  27 million was received from theCommunity in relation to electricity investment programmes as part ofthe budget refund arrangements bringing the total for 1982 up to  154million. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) expectsto receive sums of the order of  12 million in a full year in respect ofJoint European Torus (JET) and the Authority&apos;s own fusion researchprogramme. Payments also continued to United Kingdom researcherstowards research, development and demonstration work on alternative energysources and energy saving projects and for technological projects in thehydrocarbons sector being undertaken under contract to the Commission.24
9.11 During 1982, the EIB agreed to a loan facility of  50 million forBritish Nuclear Fuels Ltd. for plant associated with reprocessing at Sellafield(formerly Windscale). The ECSC agreed to a loan facility of up to  15million for the Electricity Council in connection with Drax Power Stationand the United Kingdom received  68 million in loans from the ECSC forinvestment in coal production and handling.SECTION X: THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE COMMUNITYThe European Parliament10.1 The Council of Ministers continued its consideration of theEuropean Parliament&apos;s proposals for a uniform procedure for EuropeanParliament elections. Detailed examination is taking place in a WorkingGroup, and the Foreign Affairs Council discussed the proposals at itsNovember and December meetings. A number of difficult problems havestill to be resolved before final agreement can be reached.Genscher/Colombo Proposals on European Union10.2 The ad hoc group of officials continued its work on the text ofthe proposals. A number of points have still to be resolved.European Court of Justice10.3 One case was referred to the European Court of Justice from aUnited Kingdom Court and the United Kingdom submitted written obser-vations in that case and two others.10.4 The Court gave Judgments of particular significance or interestfor the United Kingdom in a number of cases. That in the Commissionv the United Kingdom on the control of Newcastle Disease in poultry issummarised in paragraph 4.11.10.5 In another case brought by the Commission against the UnitedKingdom the Court found that the Equal Pay Act 1970, as amended, didnot fully implement the requirements of Council Directive 75/117/EEC thatmen and women should receive equal pay for work to which equal value isattributed.10.6 In Morson and Jhanjan v the Netherlands the Court held thatwhile Community law entitled migrant workers to be joined by their families,it did not prohibit a member state from refusing entry or residence to thenon-national dependants of its national workers when those workers hadnever exercised their right of freedom of movement within the Community.The situation was not one covered by Community law.10.7 Kupjerberg v Hza Mainz concerned the EEC-Portugal Free TradeAgreement. The Court held that in the absence of an express provision tothe contrary such free trade agreements, and by implication other agreementsentered into by the Community with Third Countries, were capable of25
having &quot; direct effect&quot; so as to confer on individuals rights which they couldenforce in the courts of a member state. The Court reached this conclusiondespite opposition from five member states including the United Kingdom,even though individuals in Portugal would not necessarily have equivalentrights under the agreement.Legal Co-operation10.8 The Justice Council met on 25 October for the first time sinceOctober 1978. The Ministers discussed the creation of an administrativestaff tribunal to hear cases between the staff and the institutions of theCommunity and signed on behalf of their Heads of State the Convention bywhich Greece acceded to the 1968 European Judgments Convention asamended.SECTION XI: PARLIAMENT11.1 Parliament was in session for 13 weeks during the period. TheHouse of Commons Select Committee on European Legislation, etc.considered 373 Community documents and recommended 30 of these forfurther consideration by the House. Five debates were held on the floorof the House of Commons and three debates were held in standingcommittee covering a total of 14 documents. The House of Lords SelectCommittee on the European Communities considered 409 documents andrecommended 137 for further scrutiny. Eight reports covering 10 documentswere presented to the House for debate and one report covering onedocument was presented to the House for information.

Corrections to be made for 1980 and 1981 in the light of the actualfigures, will be taken into account when negotiating the subsequent solution.3. At that time, adjustments will be made in the event that the actualfigure proves to be higher or lower than the 1982 base referred to inparagraph 1.If the actual figure is higher than 1,530 million ECU but lower than1,580 million ECU, the net compensation to the United Kingdom isunchanged. If the actual figure is higher than 1,580 million ECU butlower than 1,730 million ECU the net compensation is increased by 50 percent of the difference between the actual figure and 1,580 million ECU.If the actual figure is highter than 1,730 million ECU, the net compensationis increased by 75 million ECU plus 75 per cent of the difference betweenthe actual figure and 1,730 million ECU.If the actual figure is lower than 1,530 million ECU, but higher than1,480 million ECU, the net compensation to the United Kingdom isunchanged. If the actual figure is lower than 1,480 million ECU, the netcompensation to the United Kingdom is reduced by an amount equal to75 per cent of the difference between the actual figure and 1,480 million ECU.4. The budgetary effect of the present agreement on compensation tothe United Kingdom for 1982 on the Community budget for 1982 will belimited to the amount corresponding to the net compensation mentionedin paragraph 1.5.

ANNEX EUNITED KINGDOM VISIBLE TRADE WITHTHE EUROPEAN COMMUNITYImportance of trade with the European Community1. United Kingdom trade with other countries of the EuropeanCommunity now accounts for over 40 per cent of our overseas trade, com-pared with a share of about 30 per cent before accession. In recent yearsthe Federal Republic of Germany has been the UK&apos;s top or second exportmarket and all other member countries, apart from Greece, are among our topdozen export markets.Trade performance with the European Community (see table 1)2. In 1982 UK trade (export plus imports) with other member countriesof the European Community amounted to almost  50 billion, with a deficiton the balance of visible trade of  1.3 billion. The ratio of exports toimports was 95 per cent. This represents a slight deterioration comparedwith 1980 and 1981, but a marked improvement on previous years.By Commodity (see table 2)3. On a crude basis the deficit on visible trade with other EuropeanCommunity countries in 1982 totalled  2.1 billion and the export/importratio stood at 92 per cent. The increasing importance of North Sea Oilin the UK&apos;s trade with the rest of the European Community is reflected inthe increasing share (27 per cent in 1982) of our exports accounted for byfuels. This resulted in a crude surplus in that commodity of  4.7 billionlast year.4. The figures in tables 1 and 2 include Greece for all years.40
