CONFIDENTIAL g\/THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(83) 9 COPY NO30 March 1983CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1983-84Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentINTRODUCTIONThe length of the next Session of Parliament depends upon the timing ofthe next General Election.      If the present Parliament were to run itsfull course, the 1983-84 Session beginning in the autumn of this yearwould be rather less than six months long, and there would be room foronly a very restricted legislative programme.      If, on the other hand,the Election were held in the summer or early autumn of 1983, nextSession, the first of the new Parliament, would be of normal length,and we would be able to carry a full programme of legislation. Afterdiscussion as necessary with the Ministers concerned, theQueen&apos;s Speeches and Future Legislation Committee (QL) have drawn upthe suggested programmes for a short and a normal Session at Annexes Aand B respectively.     This memorandum seeks the agreement of theCabinet to the Committee&apos;s recommendations.    Further details of theBills listed in these Annexes  (and in Annex C, which lists other Billsto which sponsoring Ministers give a high priority) are given in C(83) 10.PROGRAMME FOR A SHORT SESSION2. In a short pre-Election Session, we would be vulnerable to disruptivetactics by the Opposition, and bringing forward long or contentious Bills .would put the entire programme, including some of the less controversialmeasures, at risk.     We shall in any case have to find time for six orseven essential Bills, and to leave a reasonable margin for one or moreof the contingent Bills;    and QL came to the conclusion that it would beunwise to plan to add more to this than four relatively short and notacutely controversial programme Bills, together with two fairlyuncontroversial Scottish Bills and three Bills to be introduced only ifthe Opposition agree to their being taken under the Second ReadingCommittee procedure in the Commons.3. The Committee recognise that the political content of this programmeis not high, and that some colleagues may feel that some of the Billslisted in Annex C should have been given a higher priority.     Of these,the Bill which would give most satisfaction to our own supporters isPerhaps the Trade Union Bill, possibly confined in a short Session todealing with the rules for union elections.    But QL considered thatadding a Bill of this kind to the programme would be likely to cause theOpposition to withdraw co-operation in Parliamentary business;    and theconfrontation that would ensue could well be more to the advantage of theminority parties than to the Government.1| CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALPROGRAMME FOR A SESSION OF NORMAL LENGTH4. The resources available to Departments and Parliamentary Counselfor the preparation of legislation are limited;    and it is impracticableto think in terms of preparing two completely different sets of Bills fora Session beginning in October/November 1983, one set for introduction ifthe Session is a short final Session of this Parliament and one forintroduction if it is the first Session of a new Parliament.     Apart fromthe special case of Scottish Bills (see below), the programme proposedby QL for a normal Session consists of the short Session programme(Annex A) plus the additional Bills listed in Annex B.    This would givea total normal Session&apos;s programme of seven essential, four contingent,13 programme, three Scottish and 11 Second Reading Committee Bills.5. QL thought that this programme would be too heavy to be manageableif the two big local government Bills (one on the structure of localgovernment and the other on local authorities&apos; revenue and expenditure)materialised.      If both are ready in time (and First ParliamentaryCounsel has consistently voiced doubts about whether this is possible)the inclusion of one or more of the other recommended programme Billswould have to be reconsidered.     But if either or both local governmentBills fail to materialise, the first two Bills in the reserve list inAnnex B might be substituted for them;    QL recommend that theTrustee Savings Banks Bill should be drafted on a contingency basis(the Dock Work Regulation Bill is already drafted) so that both can beready for introduction at any time from the beginning of the Sessiononwards if space becomes available.SCOTTISH BILLS FOR A SESSION OF NORMAL LENGTH6. Scottish Bills are not drafted by Parliamentary Counsel, andprovided that the Scottish Parliamentary Draftsmen have adequate resourcesthere is no reason in principle why the normal Session&apos;s Scottish programmeshould necessarily include those selected for a short Session.      In anormal Session, the Secretary of State for Scotland would not press hisshort Session Irrigation (Scotland) Bill, while his Valuation and Rating(Scotland) Bill would be subsumed in the wider Local Government(Miscellaneous Provisions)  (Scotland) Bill, which would also enact forScotland provisions similar to those in the Local Government Rating andExpenditure Bill.      If the England and Wales Bill did not materialise in&apos;xts entirety, the Scottish valuation and rating anomalies would still needto be dealt with, and depending on how much of the England and Wales Billdid materialise there might also be room in the programme for theHousing (Scotland) Bill.    QL recommends that the position should bereviewed when it is clearer how much of the England and Wales Bill willbe ready.    In any event, the programme for a normal Session would alsoinclude the Roads (Scotland) and Inshore Fisheries (Scotland) Bills.2| CONFIDENTIALI
CONFIDENTIALINSTRUCTIONS TO PARLIAMENTARY COUNSEL7. Finally, I again remind colleagues of the need to observe and, ifpossible, to improve on their existing timetables for the preparationof Bills selected for inclusion in either list.    This is always importantfor the orderly management of any legislative programme, but assumesspecial significance in relation to the drafting of Bills for a shortSession with a definite limit.CONCLUSION8. I invite colleagues:a. to approve the lists of Bills at Annexes A and B for ashort and a normal 1983-84 Session respectively;b. to note that the proposed normal Session&apos;s programme issubject to review in the light of progress on the two localgovernment Bills;c. to agree that all Ministers concerned should ensure thatthe stated timetables for their Bills are observed.W WHome Office30 March 19833_ CONFIDENTIAL-?-^?^??feft-^ tj 1 I
