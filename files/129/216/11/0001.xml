This will be the fifth major Statement on defence policy in a littleover two years.    I have therefore made this year&apos;s Statement somewhatshorter than the previous two, and it does not reflect any major new policyinitiatives.    In view of the continuing high level of public interest innuclear and arms control issues, these are given particular attention.3. The draft takes account of comments made by members of the Defenceand Oversea Policy Committee (OD) at its meeting on 18 April, and alsoamendments put forward subsequent to the meeting.A.      Chapter One summarises our defence policy in the light of recentevents with particular attention given to arms control negotiations.Chapter Two covers nuclear forces with emphasis on the decision todeploy cruise missiles.    Chapter Three describes the more important changesin our conventional forces.    Chapter Four covers the military balancebetween East and West.    Chapter Five deals with the financial andmanagement aspects of defence and Chapter Six draws attention to the waysin which the Services assist the community at large.    As in previous yearsthe Statement will include a number of &quot;essays&quot; designed to provideadditional background or to indicate Government thinking on importantissues of current interest.5.     I invite the Cabinet to agree to the publication of my Statement.M HMinistry of Defence29 April 1983J CONFIDENTIAL
^ ^ CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER ONEDEFENCE POLICY^*   The high level of public interest in defence matters has been maintainedduring the last year.   We have seen the initiation of the Strategic ArmsEduction Talks (START) between the United States and the Soviet Union follow-closely on the negotiations on limiting intermediate range nuclear forces^&quot;.NF), a change in the Soviet leadership and, above all, we have fought andV n the conflict over the Falkland Islands.   But the realities underlying Ur defence policy remain the same.    In this Government&apos;s first Statement onthe defence Estimates In 1980 (Cmnd 7826), we said that &quot;It is the fundamentaluty of Government to ensure the nation&apos;s security and keep it free to pursue,y just and peaceful means, its legitimate interests and activities both at0nie and abroad&quot;.   We stand by these words.    In order to carry out that dutymust plan our defences on the world as it exists, not as we would wish itbe.   we carmot afford policies based on emotion rather than logic, nor*&quot;6atrical gestures which would achieve nothing save to weaken our owncurity.    The key to our continued peace and freedom remains, as it hasdone f??.or over three decades, our membership of the North Atlantic Allianceatld thLne collective determination of the Allies to prevent war in Europe, by aof deterrence.^?.^Hest RelationsThe change in Soviet leadership has not led to any significant altera-tion i ,their general policy towards the West, to the other nations of1-1CONFIDENTIAL

M  verunchecked, with the inevitable consequences for the balance of forces betweenEast and West.    In Poland the authorities, with Soviet support, continue todeny basic freedoms to the Polish people in direct contravention of theto nuagreements signed by both the Soviet and Polish Governments at Helsinki inthe !1976.    In Afghanistan the Soviet occupation, which followed the invasion inthe ,1979 - itself a flagrant breach of the United Nations Charter - continues,and the number of Soviet troops in the country has increased to 105,000.Within the Soviet Union political opposition is ruthlessly suppressed.Vigorous measures have been taken to silence groups which have tried to104.question the Soviet record on human rights or nuclear disarmament.. Past103.    The message to the West is clear.    The Soviet Union continues to maintainmassive military forces in Europe, both conventional and nuclear, well inexcess of those required for its own defence.    These forces are being constantimproved, particularly in their mobility and firepower.    The Soviet leadershiphave demonstrated their willingness to use military force to gain their owntheends, irrespective of agreements they have signed and of internat ional opinion-011 thWhile it remains the case that there is no evidence that the Soviet Union isHiplanning any immediate attack on the West, it is plain that we and our NATOTheyAllies cannot afford to base our defences on the assumption that the Sovietleadership are essentially benevolent and concerned only with the SovietUnion&apos;s security.   The restraint shown by NATO in limiting its own forcei d ^modernisation in the 1970s was not matched; instead there was an unparalleie Soviet expansion.   The new Soviet leader has already made it clear that1-2CONFIDENTIAL

Experience Ver the years has shown that such gestures on the part of the West will be8eei  as a sign of weakness, to be exploited rather than followed.   If we areto continue to guarantee our own security, the first requirement for NATO ist0 ^intain sufficient forces, both conventional and nuclear, to convincethe Soviet leadership that they could not hope to gain from any attack onthe West.^Sg^Cpntrol and Disarmamentl%&apos;   But we must not and do not despair of ever reaching agreement with theS vlet Union on the limitation and reduction of armaments.   There have beent Past arms control successes - for example the Test Ban Treaty, the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty and to some extent the SALT process.   The firsty 8l8n of movement by the new Soviet leadership has come in the INF negotiations.^8 initially refused to negotiate at all, and then put forward a series f carefully-designed proposals which would have had the effect of requiringthe West to abandon its own modernisation programme (while placing no restraint n tl* equivalent Soviet SS20 missile deployments).   They have more recently**de new offers, the details of which are discussed further in Chapter Two.^ are still very heavily biased in the Soviet Union&apos;s favour.

LC10/12 ^CONFIDENTIAL107105. Since the 1960s NATO has been fully committed to the pursuit of armsParcontrol and disarmament measures designed to preserve our security with fewer(MBarmaments and at lower cost.   We have repeatedly reaffirmed our own commitmentWesto this policy, whether by our support for the United States in the bilaterala snegotiations between the superpowers to reduce their nuclear arsenals, or inoutour direct participation, with our Allies, in arms control negotiationshavbetween East and West.    But as we said in the section on &quot;Arms Control andSecurity&quot; in last year&apos;s Statement, our aim must be for balanced, militarilyto ,significant and binding measures whose observance can be satisfactorilyof ,verified.    Agreements which fail to meet these requirements are at bestest:illusory and at worst can actually undermine our security.    Our approachinmust be governed by realism.    Experience shows we cannot achieve success ful IUk,arms control from a position of substantial inferiority.    Our defence effortPos:and our arms control policy must therefore be complementary.106. In addition to the INF talks described in detail in paragraphs 203 to108210, negotiations are also taking place between the United States and Soviet Pe]Union on strategic nuclear weapons.    President Reagan has taken the initiativein ,by proposing to reduce rather than just limit these systems, and the negotia-te]tions, which began in June 1982, are thus known as the Strategic Arms ReductionTalks (START).    The American approach has been to concentrate in the firsttheinstance on the most destabilising systems, land-based strategic missiles,and they have put forward proposals for substantial reductions in both missileSwestand warheads.    The Soviet Union has rejected these proposals, but has set&quot;opout ideas of its own which, although less radical and heavily qualified, do&quot;&quot;eajappear to accept the concept of reductions. ,1-4CONFIDENTIAL

In a renewed effort to achieve real progress theWest took a major new initiative in July 1982.    It proposed, in treaty form,a single comprehensive agreement bringing in all direct participants from the0utset to take significant shares in force reductions.    So far Eastern reactionsha*e been negative.    Deadlock remains on the crucial disagreement over thelisting size of Eastern forces and thus the size of the reductions neededt0 achieve parity.   The East still has not responded to the Western proposalsof ^ly 1981 to make progress on this issue, and the same reluctance toestablish satisfactory verification measures has been evident in Vienna asln other negotations.   The latest Eastern proposals tabled in February 1983,Uka their predecessors, show no significant change from their long-standingPosition and make no attempt to meet the main Western concerns.   We stillawait some sign that the East is prepared to negotiate seriously.l08-   The Madrid Follow-up Meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-nation in Europe (CSCE) reconvened on 9 November 1982.    It had adjourned jln        previous March following severe criticism by Western delegations,Eluding Foreign Ministers, of violations of the Helsinki Final Act following jthe imposition of martial law in Poland.    The debate on the implementation of jthe Final Act has continued at the resumed sessions, but work has focussedPtll*ipally on the negotiation of the Meeting&apos;s concluding document. TheWestern Alliance is working for a substantial and balanced document providingf r * Conference on Disarmament in Europe (to negotiate confidence-building^sures applicable to the whole of Europe) and additional commitments onhun&gt;an rights and in other fields of the Final Act.1-5CONFIDENTIAL

Particular attention has been focussed on the problem of chemical ^conweapons.    The evidence of the use of such weapons in South-East Asia andtoAfghanistan underlines the need for a comprehensive and fully verifiableconvention to ban their development, production and stockpiling.    All Britishtec&apos;stocks were destroyed many years ago, and with other members of the Allianceof ?we have been striving to achieve such a ban through the Chemical Weaponsof ,Working Group in Geneva.    Again, verification is the key; we have tabledthaipapers on this aspect of a possible treaty, most recently in March of thisthijyear.    But, despite some vague hints, the Soviet Union has so far refused tothediscuss the details of inspection procedures that they would be prepared totoleaccept.the110. In many of these negotiations there is likely to be considerable activitySpaiin the coming months.    We and our Allies will continue to adopt a positiveorigapproach in a search for real, effective and balanced measures to reduce themmlevel of arms on both sides.   Nevertheless we shall remain on our guard forSoviet attempts to use arms control negotiations as political instrumentsfor achieving their own objectives.    Past Soviet behaviour has shown that,mm to while they are prepared to accept such agreements once convinced that it ispactto their advantage to do so, they are also always seeking opportunities toof &quot;use arms control talks as a means of dividing the Allies.    In particularthey wish to reduce the United States commitment to the defence of Europeand to manipulate public opinion in the West to undermine NATO&apos;s strengthand resolve from within.for t1-6CONFIDENTIAL
^ ^ CONFIDENTIAL^jtaln and NATO^    The past year has not been an easy one for the NATO Alliance. Publicc ncern over the role of nuclear weapons in allied defence and the approachto arms control has led to some questioning of NATO strategy while differences f view on such issues as the Siberian gas pipeline and the transfer of~echnology to the Soviet Union have received much publicity.    In an Alliance ^ free independent nations it is inevitable that there will be differences ^ view on how to approach major issues related to the common defence, and^at in our open societies these differences will be publicly aired. Buttnis does not mean that NATO is in a state of crisis; the forces that unitehe AlHance are far too strong to be broken by temporary differences. Thederation of such varying opinions only underlines NATO&apos;s strength, whichhag vDeen founded for more than 30 years on its members&apos; common goal, to defend^e freedom and sovereignty of all the Allies.    1982 saw the accession ofSipainn as the sixteenth member of the Alliance, and the fourth to join the^Sinal twelve signatories of the Treaty in 1949.   No country has everVol.Luntarily joined the Warsaw Pact.We have made it clear in successive statements that the major threatne security of the United Kingdom remains the Soviet Union and its Warsaw^actaHies, and that our membership of NATO provides the only realistic wayc untering that threat.   It cannot be repeated too often that NATO is ansive alliance, and its overriding aim is the prevention of war by deterringession.    The British contribution to this collective deterrence, both in f our conventional and nuclear forces and in making available basesUnited States forces, is of crucial importance to the Alliance. Should1-7CONFIDENTIAL
ICONFIDENTIALcapwe withdraw these forces and close the bases, not only would NATO&apos;s abilitynotto deter be substantially weakened, but the cohesion of the Alliance wouldseabe put seriously at risk.   The result would be to undermine stability inresEurope, increase the danger of war and thus jeopardise our own security.outUnited Kingdom Defence Policydep113. Recognising the primacy of NATO in our defence policy, in Cmnd 8288tea&quot;The Way Forward&quot; we identified the four main roles in which the Armed Forcessottcontribute to the collective deterrent: the provision of independent strategictheand theatre nuclear forces committed to the Alliance; the direct defence of875the United Kingdom homeland; a major land and air contribution on the Europeanourmainland; and the deployment of a major maritime capability in the EasternfurAtlantic and the Channel.    In. Cmnd 8758 we reaffirmed that these roles remainactthe priority for our defence effort, and that the enhancement and modernisationlopof forces devoted to these tasks must still have the first call on ourtheresources.    Chapter Two includes details of the United Kingdom&apos;s contributionto the Alliance&apos;s nuclear deterrent, and in Chapter Three we highlight theUsmajor changes in the equipment and organisation of our conventional forces.mobAs noted in Chapter Five, we are substantially increasing defence expenditurequain real terms over the next few years, and we have made provision to meetthe NATO aim of 3% annual real growth up to 1985/86, with additional provisionPotfor Falklands Islands associated costs.fes114. &quot;The Way Forward&quot; also underlined the importance of the need for theleaUnited Kingdom, and indeed the Alliance as a whole, to take account of theOfthreat to Western security interests outside the NATO area.    Although our1-8CONFIDENTIAL
0 % CONFIDENTIALcapability to carry out operations in the rest of the world is necessarilyn t comparable with that intended to discharge our NATO roles, in either itsscale or nature, it can still exert an influence out of all proportion to the^sources involved.    At present we engage in a great deal of military activity utside Europe.    In addition to garrisons we maintain in such places asCvPrus, Hong Kong, the Falkland Islands and Belize, this activity rangesfrom peace keeping operations such as those in the Lebanon and Sinai, throughdePloyments and exercises, to loan service and seconded personnel, trainingteams, and sales assistance.   These limited forms of involvement can represents me of the most economical and cost effective ways of protecting and advancingthe United Kingdom&apos;s interests outside the NATO area.    As explained in Cmnd8?58, we are planning to make a number of improvements in the capability of0ur NATO forces to operate outside as well as in Europe.   We are also takingfurther steps to improve the coordination and effectiveness of these diverseactivities which, although subordinate to our primary NATO roles, form anltnPortant component of our overall defence policy.    Our activities outsidethe NATO area are described further in Chapter Three.ll5    The Falklands Campaign underlined the importance of the flexibility,^Uity and readiness of our forces and it demonstrated the outstandingquality and commitment of our Servicemen.   Above all it made abundantlyClear that successful deterrence rests cricially on the perceptions of aPotential enemy.    The Argentine Government miscalculated our ability andtes lve to defend our territory and our people.   The result was war. WeHave maintained peace in Europe for over three decades because the Sovietleadership has been in no doubt about the collective ability and determination f the NATO Allies to defend their freedom.    It is all the more important1-9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthat, after a decade of unparalleled growth in the military strength of theSoviet Union, and in the face of an unremitting propaganda campaign designedto divide the Alliance and weaken our resolve, we should not now underminethe credibility of our deterrent by indulging in any onesided reductions inI 1our own defences.    Nor, by the same token, should we fail to carry throughI fmeasures which we and our Allies have judged necessary to maintain theI 6|effectiveness of our common defence.   We will continue to strive for balancedI aimeasures of arms control to reduce the forces of both sides so that we canI a,maintain our security at a lower cost, but our defence policy and that ofI 01the West as a whole will continue to be founded on the basis of making clearI pito the nations of the Warsaw Pact that they cannot use or threaten to use .armed force against us except at the gravest risk to their own interests. ,I 2,In short we remain committed to the policy that all individual members of ,I m NATO have supported since the Alliance was founded: keeping the peace by ieffective deterrence. iI e&gt;I deI mcI PtI deI deI apI ofI th1-10^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^ W CONFIDENTIAL_______ESSAY_,____I NATO STRATEGY II l      Since 1949 the North Atlantic Alliance has maintained the peace and |I freedom of its member nations by a policy of deterrence.   This is an |I essentially defensive strategy: NATO will not use any of its forces unless |I an attack is launched on a member nation, but in the event of any such |I Agression the Allies have agreed to regard an attack on one as an attack |I 0li all.   Deterrence means maintaining sufficient forces to convince any |&apos; Potential enemy that he could not hope to gain from such an attack. |&apos; 2&quot;     Throughout its existence NATO has had to face the threat posed by the |I Passive conventional forces of the Soviet Union and the other members of the |&apos; Warsaw Pact.   In the early days of the Alliance the West could rely on the |&apos; existence of the vastly superior nuclear forces of the United States to |&apos; deter Soviet aggression against Western Europe.    But as the Soviet Union |&apos; ttoved towards broad nuclear parity in the late 1960s, NATO adopted its |&apos; Present strategy of &quot;flexible response&quot;.     The aim of this strategy is to |&apos; deter by making plain to a potential enemy that NATO has the ability and |&apos; termination to resist aggression by an effective military response at an |&apos; aPPropriate level.   The flexible response strategy has had the full support |of successive British Governments, and indeed of the Governments of all |the members of NATO, whatever their political complexion, for over 15 years. || j1-11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL ^3.     Flexible response means that NATO must be seen to be able to mount a I irobust conventional defence against attack, so as to make clear to the Soviet I | eleadership that they could not hope to gain a quick or easy victory.    This I [| means having conventional forces deployed forward in Europe in considerable I 1| strength, and having the ability to bring up reinforcements in substantial| numbers in good time.   Facing a potential aggressor deploying not only very I 5| large numbers of conventional forces but also a wide range of strategic and I N.|  theatre nuclear forces, NATO must itself maintain adequate nuclear forces if I t]| deterrence is to be effective.    The aim of the Alliance is to convince the I o| Soviet Union that we have at our disposal a range of defensive options that I ci| would enable us both to respond to any attack at an appropriate level and I r| any gains which Soviet aggression might be designed to achieve would be out- I tl| weighed by the damage which would be inflicted on them. ^ 0:I I Hi| 4.     There are several misunderstandings about the nature of the flexible I w:| response strategy.   Firstly it does not commit NATO to respond to an attack I ni| in a pre-ordained way.   If its fundamental purpose of preventing war failed, I dt| the Alliance&apos;s objective would be to stop the conflict at the lowest possible I I aj| level.   Although NATO&apos;s forces are outnumbered by those of the Warsaw Pact,|  they are well trained and equipped; it should not be assumed that they would I e\| easily succumb to a conventional attack, even on a massive scale.    NATO ^ W(| cannot hope to match the Warsaw Pact conventional forces in numerical terms I| unless the member countries are prepared to accept very substantialincreases I at1-12CONFIDENTIAL1

However the Alliance is currently examining ways of |? 1 I exPloiting new developments in technology (discussed on pages [4-9] tot^-13]) to improve the defensive capability of conventional forces in theI longer term so as to enhance deterrence..     The existence of substantial numbers of nuclear weapons as part ofNATO&apos;s deterrent forces does not therefore mean that, if deterrence failed,^ey would inevitably be used; nor does it mean that NATO strategy is based n an intention of fighting and winning a nuclear war.   The Allies need no1 c nvincing that in such a war there would be no winners.   The flexibleresponse strategy does not encompass any concept of a &quot;first strike&quot; - |that is an attempt to mount a pre-emptive attack against the nuclear forces f the Warsaw Pact nor does It imply a commitment to the early use ofnuclear weapons.    It does mean, however, that the Soviet Union must reckonwith the possibility that NATO would be prepared, if necessary, to usenuclear weapons in self-defence.    This is an essential part of effectivedeterrence.    To abandon the strategy of flexible response would only servee as a signal to the Soviet Union that they could undertake a conventionalWar in Central Europe without putting their own homeland at risk. But6ven if NATO should reach the point of considering the use of nucleardPons, its objective would still remain the same: to convince the Sovietleadership that they had miscalculated the Alliance&apos;s resolve to resist |atlc* that by continuing the conflict they would be running unacceptable risks. |1-13CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL6. NATO&apos;s strategy depends upon the Alliance having adequate forces in Ieach element of the so-called &quot;triad&quot; - conventional, theatre nuclear and I^1 ??5- I 201strategic nuclear forces.   Without this range of forces the Soviet Union I| might calculate they could escalate any conflict to a level at which the Ii beei| Alliance had no credible response.   Effective deterrence thus requires a Ifull range of military options.    The United Kingdom contributes to all 1three elements of the triad, both by committing to the Alliance our own 1conventional and nuclear forces and by providing bases for the United 1States forces.   Any rejection of this strategy, of which nuclear deterrence iis an integral part, would make nonsense of our membership of an Alliance i ne| which has been the cornerstone of our security for nearly thirty-five 1[ years.    It would lead to a major weakening of NATO, an undermining of 1, ess.deterrence and consequently an increase rather than a decrease in the risK i| of war. 1I 2 2&apos;i ? B m7.

Some of these are examined in the| essay on page [2-10].II 202.   The NATO Heads of Government reaffirmed once again at the meeting in| B nn in June 1982 that none of the Alliance&apos;s weapons - conventional or| nuclear _   wlll ever be used except in response to attack.

Conventional improvements will certainly take place and they could abovwell help to reduce the likelihood of nuclear weapons ever being used; but lat{they will be costly and may not be affordable on the scale required. It is a Urunrealistic to imagine that, in the foreseeable future, they could eliminate thatthe requirement for a nuclear capability to deter an overwhelming conven- sit6tional attack; nor would they affect the need for appropriate nuclear forces in tto deter the use of the very substantial and comprehensive armoury of nuclear co^pweapons at the disposal of the Soviet Union. Moreover effective deterrence forcrequires that NATO must be seen to have a credible response to Soviet aggres-sion at any level, conventional or nuclear. This is the rationale behind 204,the general composition of NATO&apos;s nuclear forces and, in particular, behind in athe current plans to modernise the Alliance&apos;s intermediate range nuclear beenforces (INF).

Since the 1960s, NATO&apos;s INF capable of NATOreaching the Soviet Union have consisted of US Fill and RAF Vulcan aircraft &amp;H&lt;Jbased in the United Kingdom.   The Vulcans have been withdrawn from RAF serviceleaving approximately 170 Fills as NATO&apos;s only system in this longer-range c0ntcategory.   While NATO capabilities have been slowly declining the SovietUnion has been modernising its equivalent forces, including the deployment ^5,of large numbers of the formidable SS20 missile.    The introduction of these by amissiles, each of which carries three warheads compared with the single ^2-2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALWarhead of the older SS4 and SS5 missiles, has meant that the number offissile warheads in this category directly threatening NATO has risen fromab ut 600 in the mid 1970s to about 1,000 now.    In the Spring of 1982 thelate President Brezhnev announced what was patently designed to be taken as* bilateral f reeze on SS20 deployments west of the Urals.    It is now clearthat this moratorium did not apply to the completion of partially constructedSi t-es     Since Brezhnev&apos;s announcement five further bases have been completed*n that area, adding some 135 warheads to the threat.    NATO still has noc mparable missiles deployed in Europe.

Eventually, however, convinced of NATO&apos;s determination to go ahead,thethe Soviet leadership agreed to the INF negotiations, which began in 1981.to ,At the outset of the negotiations President Reagan, with the full support ofto8eNATO, proposed the so-called &quot;zero option&quot;, which aims to eliminate entirelyvhiia whole class of land-based nuclear missiles.

Since the original decision we have been making good progress across aDUlbroad front with the detailed definition of our requirements.   Where possibleBH &apos;heour aim has been to exploit to the full the commonality with the United Statesr^suafforded by Trident II to reduce the cost of our own programme.    One area weexamined was the arrangements for the support of the missiles when Tridententers RN service in the mid 1990s. Trident components will be more reliable ^--tA]and have a longer life than those for Polaris, allowing missiles to remain in215,their tubes throughout their planned 7-8 year period between major submarine Per-refits, with such periodic servicing as is necessary carried out in thesubmarines themselves by British personnel.    This is not the case with Polaris* Cc (levelwhere the missiles have to be removed from the submarines at more frequent(ABM)intervals and maintenance carried out ashore.

The arrangement1&apos; . 1,1 thsignificantly reduces our requirement for new shore facilities at Loch Longin Scotland.

Weestimate that this decision will produce a net saving for the defence programDieof several hundred millions of pounds in capital costs with equal, if notgreater, additional savings in running costs over the life of the system.The arrangements do not apply to our nuclear warheads, which will be heldand processed in the United Kingdom.2-8CONFIDENTIAL

At average 1982/83 prices, the estimate is approximately  7*biUi0n.

CONFIDENTIALESSAYI NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT: ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES |&apos; The last two annual Statements on the Defence Estimates have included|I essays designed to explain the background to the Government&apos;s policy onI nuclear deterrence (&quot;Nuclear Weapons and Preventing War&quot; in 1981) andI disarmament (&quot;Arms Control and Security&quot; in 1982).   The continuing concern]1  ver nuclear weapons and over the relatively slow progress towards armsc ntrol agreements has led to proposals for several alternative approaches]to NATO&apos;s aim of balanced, verifiable, militarily significant measures ofdisarmament.    There is no doubt that some of these ideas have been putf rward or fostered by the Soviet Union in an attempt to exploit publicconcern in the West to its own advantage, but it is nevertheless rightthat they should all be given serious consideration and judged on their^rits.    The Government recognises the public concern over these issues, |and welcomes informed debate so that they can be judged on the basis ofthe relevant facts.    This essay considers some ideas which have beenadvanced in recent months.^-Huglear Freeze || 2The Soviet proposal for a freeze on the production and/or deployment ^ all nuclear weapons would be attractive if it resulted in a stable and |Genuine balance of forces between East and West.    But in presentI eirn i*-cumstances it would do no more than perpetuate and legitimise existing |2-10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL ^ ^| Soviet superiority, most noticably in the INF, which are the subject ofthe Geneva negotiations. The current imbalance is not only numerical, as |shown in Figure 3 of Chapter Four but qualitative: over the last decadethe Soviet Union has modernised or replaced many of its nuclear weapons, || while NATO has adopted a policy of self-imposed restraint. A freeze would|prevent the West taking steps to modernise its forces to ensure that they |continue to provide an effective deterrent, and would create a dangerous || instability.    It would also be very difficult to verify, and Sovietbehaviour over their unilateral &quot;moratorium&quot; on SS20 deployments has| underlined the need to ensure that there is no scope for covert cir-| cumvention.   Finally by removing any incentive for the Soviet Union to| negotiate seriously, it would militate against the more important andurgent task of seeking real reductions in the forces of both sides.No First Use of Nuclear Weapons3. NATO&apos;s strategy of deterrence is to prevent war by making plain that |the Alliance has the ability and determination to resist military aggres- I| sion at any level.   NATO is a defensive alliance and has made it clearthat none of its weapons, nuclear or conventional, will be used except in I| response to attack.   This was formally reaffirmed by the NATO Heads of .| Government at their meeting in Bonn in June 1982.   Moreover both the ,| United Kingdom and the United States have undertaken not to use nuclear .| weapons save in the case of an attack by another nuclear power or a ,I 2-11CONFIDENTIAL1 ^
^ CONFIDENTIAL1 state allied to a nuclear power.   It might therefore seem unremarkable to |1 80 one step further and agree a mutual no first use pact with the SovietI Union. But such a proposition ignores the fundamental differences between |I the threats faced by the Warsaw Pact and by NATO.   The Warsaw Pact has no |1 reason to fear aggression by NATO and every reason for confidence that the|massive Eastern Bloc conventional superiority would defeat any conven-tional attack without recourse to nuclear weapons.   NATO can have nosimilar confidence in Soviet motivations nor, in the light of the con-1 National imbalance, can the Alliance be confident of deterring anyastern aggression by its conventional forces alone; without the deterrent| f Possible first use of nuclear weapons by NATO, Soviet Union might bePrepared to risk a conventional attack.   NATO, for its own part, hasforesworn the first use of any form of force.   Experience teaches us to be|Wary Qf Soviet undertakings of this nature: the Soviet invasions ofAfghanistan and Czechoslovakia were both clear breaches of the UnitedNations Charter which forbids the use of force against other sovereign&apos; 8tates. |~^clear Weapon Free Zones |A variety of ideas has been mooted for creating zones in Europe inwhich the deployment of any nuclear weapons would be prohibited. Theyr&amp;rige from a &quot;nuclear-free Europe&quot; to zones of varying breadth either side|I  Of j.icne East/West border in central Europe.   But there are a number of2-12CONFIDENTIAL
ICONFIDENTIAL| practical disadvantages to such a concept.   Militarily it would be of| little significance since targets within such a zone could readily be| attacked by longer-range systems based outside it, and the mobility of| most nuclear weapon delivery systems means they could be deployed into| such a zone at very short notice in a crisis.   Effective verification| would pose serious problems.    In the case of the most frequent proposal| for a &quot;battlefield&quot; nuclear free zone in Europe, most of the weapons con- |cerned have both a nuclear and a conventional role, so that problems ofdefinition would arise.   Nor would such a zone raise the nuclearthreshold; this is essentially determined by the strength of NATO&apos;s| conventional defences and not its nuclear capability or its location. [| Indeed the Palme Commission Report on Disarmament and Security, which put || forward the proposal for such a zone, recognised these drawbacks but I| felt that the idea still had some value as a means of building confidence || between East and West. In response to the Palme report the Soviet Union || has proposed a battlefield nuclear weapon free zone of some 500-600| kilometres width.    In addition to the disadvantages already mentioned, azone of this size would greatly favour the Warsaw Pact powers because of I|  their overwhelming advantage in ballistic nuclear missiles capable of I ,striking such a zone from outside. In practice the creation of any sort I ,| of nuclear free zone in Europe would be of little military value, and I| would create a quite false impression of enhanced security. i2-13CONFIDENTIAL
% CONFIDENTIALI I |I 5.     One-sided Measures.HI The principal aim of those who favour unilateral nuclear disarmament is |I the removal of all nuclear weapons, both British and American, from the |I United Kingdom.   The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament has recognised the |I iogical consequence of this and has called for British withdrawal from |I NATO.   Our position on this is clear: without our membership of NATO and |I without nuclear weapons we would be virtually defenceless against Soviet |I threats; we would have abrogated our first duty to safeguard the peace and|^ freedom of the nation.   Moreover a NATO without Britain would be fatally |I Weakened and, faced with the massive Warsaw Pact conventional and nuclear |&apos; f rces, the ability of the West to deter aggression would be substantially!1 teduced.    Others have advocated limited one-sided measures in the hope |I that this would provide a catalyst to more widespread disarmament.    But |&apos; there is no evidence that any other countries would be persuaded to follow|I Such an example.   What is the Soviet record?    In the late 1950s we uni- |&apos; laterally abandoned chemical weapons, and the US ceased production in |&apos; 1969.   The Soviet Union today has a massive and growing chemical warfare |&apos; CaPability.    In the 1970s NATO introduced few new nuclear weapon systems |&apos; atld maintained the number of nuclear warheads virtually unchanged; in |&apos; 1981 the Alliance unilaterally withdrew 1,000 nuclear warheads from its |&apos; European stockpile.    The Soviet response was to sustain a massive in- |&apos; Crese, both quantitative and qualitative, in its own nuclear arsenal over |___|2-14CONFIDENTIALA

The Alliance&apos;s twin policies of deterrence and || multilateral disarmament may have less immediate appeal than some of the || more radical alternatives now being proposed, but they have preserved the |I el| peace in Europe for over thirty years and will continue to do so provided |the West remains resolute in its approach.    The policy of maintaining I| adequate defences while being willing to negotiate balanced reductions in |?

The first new military communications1satellite is expected to be launched in 1985, and will significantly enhance4our maritime communications.td332. Design work is now well under way on the Type 23 frigate.   This newclass of ship will complement the existing Type 22 frigate, and will be ^designed to conduct anti-submarine warfare (ASW) in the North Atlantic andgeneral purpose duties worldwide.   ASW is the most challenging of all ourmaritime tasks.   The scale of the Soviet threat underlines the vital need to - defend the trans-atlantic shipping on which we would be highly dependent in3.time of tension or war for the reinforcement and resupply of the Europeani aitheatre of operations and the United Kingdom base.   We also have a key roleto play in providing ASW protection for the NATO Striking Fleet.   The Type-   m 0)23 frigate will incorporate the most modern technology to enable it to performt(these vital roles.   It will be fitted with a towed sonar to detect hostilesubmarines at long range in deep water and a hull mounted active sonar forshallow-water detection.   Contacts will be prosecuted by the ship&apos;s own ASWhelicopter, which will be equipped to pinpoint the target and attack it withSeStingray torpedoes.333. The Type 23 will be armed with the Sea Wolf short range anti-missile3-14CONFIDENTIAL

Its equipment will also include&quot;Kxiem surface-to-surface guided weapons and a torpedo launching system forclose range defence against submarines.   New radars and the most advancedcommas system are also planned.   To optimise the performance of its ASWSensors, the ship will be powered by uniquely quiet diesel electric enginesitl combination with the new marine version of the Spey gas turbine. The^Pe 23 design will take account of experience gained in the Falklands campaign.Th-e need to keep costs down has been given close attention throughout thedesign stage.   This is reflected, for example, in the reduction of over atllird in the ship&apos;s complement by comparison with the Type 22. Detaileddesign work is now well in hand at Yarrows, the lead shipbuilders, and wehave employed outside consultants to advise on any areas where an alternativeaPProach might produce the same capability more economically.RAF334  Two squadrons of Buccaneer aircraft will be run on in the maritime strikeattack role.

By the middle of 1983, the re-organisation of 1(BR) Corps into threew:larger and more powerful divisions will be complete.   The new organisationwill give the flexibility and balance necessary to fight the immediate tacticalbattle (particularly if there is only a short warning of attack) and providesita credible Corps reserve.   A fourth division has been formed in the UnitedKingdom around Headquarters 2nd Infantry Division at York which was relocatedfrom BAOR earlier this year.

Factors such ase8ic objectives and requirements, the age and quality of equipment andPositsoning of forces and training clearly play an important part. Never-theleSs &gt; numerical differences give an impression of the scale of the Soviet&quot;Hitry effort and the degree of imbalance between NATO and Warsaw Pactforces.^^^-gQVlETTOREATe Soviet military build up in recent years is well illustrated by thesteady ln-&quot;.&quot;crease in military expenditure.   NATO&apos;s current estimate is that1970 this has risen by an average of 4 per cent a year in real terms,Wtlile NATnexpenditure during the 1970s showed an overall slight decline.S vletefence expenditure now accounts for some 14-16 per cent of GNP inPrices, over twice the level of any NATO country.   Moreover with aW8ely can ,&quot;&quot;.script army and low labour costs the Soviet Union spends a muchSDlaller tjProportion of its defence budget on personnel and can thereforetouch greater proportion to equipment and research.   The scale ofProgrammes in the Soviet Union suggests that military spending willC nti ue at- udC a high level during the rest of the 1980s.

H u_At the strategic level, over the past decade the Soviet Union has improved%the quality of its forces to a much greater extent than NATO.    Since 1970 Vi^three new types of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and at least Jthree new submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) have been introducedwhereas the US has put only two new SLBMs into service.   The MX ICBM, which ^E^r,the US is planning to deploy from 1986 as part of the modernisation of itsstrategic nuclear forces will be its first new ICBM since 1970.    Currently \the Soviet Union has several ICBMs, a new heavy bomber (Blackjack) and long&quot; ^\ ^range cruise missiles under development and has recently tested a new ICBM. ^^ii404. Below the strategic level, the intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) &lt;.c ^and short-range systems of the Warsaw Pact and NATO are shown.   Among theLlonger-range systems, the main change since the end of 1981 has been theincrease in the deployment of SS20 missiles within range of Western Europe ^3from 190 to about 245 (the total number of SS20 launchers deployed throughoutthe Soviet Union has risen from 279 to 351 on latest estimates).    Some ofthe older SS4 and 5 missiles are being withdrawn slowly, but since the SS20carries three warheads, the total number of nuclear missile warheads in thiscategory has risen to some 1,300, of which about 1,000 threaten WesternEurope.   This compares with the 600 deployed in the early 1970s.   NATO hasno comparable missiles and since last year the number of NATO longer-rangeaircraft has reduced because of the completed withdrawal from service of tneRAF Vulcan in the nuclear role.

The overall picture remains of an unremitting Soviet build up both infonuclear and conventional capability.   This trend has continued for well overtoa decade, even through those periods which we in the West regarded as the highAl;point of detente.   The Alliance cannot ignore these facts, and while we mustnot dismiss any genuine offers from the Soviet Union which could lead todisarmament or a reduction in tension, common prudence dictates that Soviet*adeeds rather than words will always be a surer guide to their real intentions. ^NATO&apos;S RESPONSEtie411. It was recognition of the need to respond to the unflagging growth of ^the Soviet threat that led the member nations of NATO to agree, in 1977,that they should aim for annual real increases in defence spending of around3%.   We remain firmly committed to this target.    Simply committing more ^resources to defence is not enough however; and in a democratic society t^there are constraints on the total level of defence spending.    It is equally ^important therefore that we and our Allies make more efficient use of the4-5CONFIDENTIAL
0 % CONFIDENTIALl resources we have. At a summit meeting in June 1982 NATO leaders recognised Hthis, and in the communique issued after the summit urged the Alliance to H6^ine ways of meeting this need. Our experiences in the Falklands, for H6^Ple in the conversion and use of civil assets for military duties, could Hbe ^levant. We have kept our allies informed of the lessons that emerged H t * the conflict.412- NATO needs to respond most vigorously to the conventional threats. H**  was another of the principal points to emerge from the NATO summit. ?But ^ is not necessary for NATO to match the Warsaw Pact tank for tank and H Un for gun: nor indeed is it necessary for NATO&apos;s essentially defensive Hf0rc^ to mirror too closely the structure of the essentially offensive Hf0rces of the Warsaw Pact.    In the longer term it may be possible for the Hto take advantage of new technology emerging in the United StatesElsewhere to produce conventional weapons systems with a much increasedtapabiiity and in particular with the ability to strike accurately targetsfat b*yond the battlefield.   The implications of a successful combination f       technology and certain new tactical concepts are discussed in greaterd*tal* on page [     ].    It is important to stress that any changes to NATO&apos;sPlans which emerge from the exploitation of new technology and the use ofta&lt;*ics will be firmly rooted in the existing framework of the Alliance&apos;ssttafLeSy of flexible response.^       Soviet threat not only manifests itself in and around Europe.

The actions we are taking to maintainand improve the United Kingdom&apos;s ability to operate outside the NATO areaInreflect a shared recognition that there is a growing threat to Western interesoutside the North Atlantic Treaty area.   Although there is no intention toI 1extend the Treaty area, other nations as well as ourselves are taking stepsI n&lt;to improve their ability to counter threats to security in regions of vitalI b,interest to the West.   For example the United States Rapid Deployment TaskI CiForce became operational on 1 January 1983 and is planned to reach its fullI a:strength in 1987; elements of the Force have already exercised in the MiddleI tlEast.   The United States is also expanding its Navy to 600 ships.

NEW TACTICS1 l-     The nature of the Soviet conventional threat to the Alliance arises |1 not only from the sheer numbers and weight of their forces and equipment, | ??1 but also from the highly aggressive nature of their tactics.   Soviet tacti- |1 cal doctrine relies on bringing overwhelming force to bear on a particular |1 axi* of attack, and maintaining intense pressure on defensive positions by |1 the constant replacement of exhausted by fresh units so that the momentum |1 of an attack can be maintained and defenders are faced with a seemingly |&apos; never-ending stream of vigorous well equipped attackers.    This tactic, if |1 ^cessfully carried out, could achieve the Soviet aim of the rapid and |&apos; ^rwhelmng defeat of NATO forces.   However it demands detailed planning |&apos; and a relatively rigid assignment of units to axes of attack.   More impor- |&apos; tantly it requires that reinforcements arrive at the front line in good | ??1  tder and at the right time.    If these units could be attacked before they j1 teached the battle zone - in other words at some distance beyond the front |1 Une - the momentum of the assault would be disrupted, and pressure on the |^nsive line would be relieved.This idea of striking deep behind the front line is not new.   The |1 lnterdiction of enemy airfields and other high value targets, principally || ^ &quot;*nned aircraft, has for some time been a feature of Alliance tactical |4-8CONFIDENTIALJ _113

What is new, however, is the extent to which NATO&apos;s ability to Iundertake interdiction missions at much increased range, and with more Ichance of success, could be improved by the exploitation of new technology* IThis is a feature of a number of new tactical concepts - the US Army&apos;s Air ILand Battle 2000 for example - which are being studied in NATO.   The &apos; .| Alliance is also considering work arising from the US initiative on Emerging 1Technology at the NATO summit meeting in June 1982. 1 I| 3.     The exploitation of new technology is potentially one of the West&apos;sIgreatest assets, since the free world&apos;s capacity for invention and innova-tion is much greater than that of the   Soviet Bloc.    This could be of IBi i tj| immense importance in an era when the pace of technological change is |I  increasing so rapidly.   The most dramatic improvements stemming from i? 1 Pitechnological advance are expected to occur in three broad areas:i ^I &apos; T a. Conventional weapons effectiveness.   Development of systems li^e i-- I 1 cathe Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) could enable NATO to field i| conventional weapons with a greatly increased capability.   The impli | ^cations for enhanced conventional deterrence and a consequent raisi S iIof the nuclear threshold, are considerable. I,1b. Targetting.   In order to create maximum disruption in the enemyrear it will be important both to locate high value targets at con-siderable distance, and to guide weapons on to such targets.

CONFIDENTIAL ^ ^| 5.     The introduction of new technology cannot take place overnight,| nor should it be seen as a panacea for any weakness In our conventional| forces.   There are three main reasons for this.   Owing to their long| gestation period weapons systems that take advantage of even modest tech-| nological advances are unlikely to appear in numbers for some years; and| more advanced systems may take a decade or more to appear.   This is oflittle comfort when NATO faces a massive conventional threat now, and ithighlights the need for the Alliance to make the best use of what it has.| Another problem is that of cost.   New technology is not cheap.   There is a| limit to how far quality can substitute for quantity, and advanced weapons| will have to be deployed in sufficient numbers to provide a credibledeterrent.   The third problem concerns our potential adversary.   The Soviet| Union is hardly likely to idly by while the West develops weapons and| tactics that take advantage of possible weaknesses in their strategic and| tactical plans.   We should not underestimate their ability to adapt theirtactics.   Nor should we ignore their ability to develop their own hightechnology weapons, weapons moreover that are likely to be as effective i | attack as in defence. There is a related problem of control of technologyQ g I| transfer to the Soviet Bloc.   The Soviet Union has had considerable succI and Iin the past in making use of Western technology for military purposes,its efforts to acquire it are unlikely to diminish in an age of rapidsay &apos;technological advancement.   Nevertheless, the ideas discussed In this es| might, if realised, lead to a major improvement In NATO&apos;s conventionalcapability.

WMV lurae 2 of thl8 statement contains a number of further analyses of the WMl983/84 Estimates.^ ENCE MANAGEMENT* . Given the scale of defence expenditure, the Department has always placed BOcular emphasis on good management of its resources and on increasing the Hefficiency and effectiveness of its organisation.    This is in line with our WMGlared policy of improving the quality of public sector management.    In WM ^r to make further substantial advances the Ministry of Defence is currently WMProducing the MINIS system of Management Information for Ministers and top WM^gement, based on the system already operating in the Department of the WMEnvironment.5%- The MINIS system is designed to provide top management - Ministers, WM^ officers and officials - with sufficient management information, WMOcularly about activities, costs and performance,  to provide an overall WMWct^e of all the functions of the Department and to allow them to exercise WMthelr management of these functions positively rather than reactively.    It is Hbel^ developed to link with and complement the management control, information WM^ ^counting systems which already exist in the Department and to encompass WM^ ^ the headquarters organisation but also the major executive operations WMtHat Element defence policy.    MINIS will cover some 150 individual management WMateaS&gt; typically headed by an Under Secretary, Rear Admiral or equivalent WMS6rVi^ rank, each of whom will be required to produce a return setting out a WM5-2CONFIDENTIALA 19 9

Further proposals for improving management of defence activities weretaset out in the Report of the Study of Financial Accountability, publishedin 1982 as Open Government document 82/25.   Decisions on its recommendationsI 50are being taken progressively.   One of the major proposals in the report isthat a comprehensive system of Responsibility Budgets should be introducedthwith the aim of strengthening financial control over the cost of activitiesand giving greater financial responsibility to line managers.   As a means ofevaluating this proposal it has been decided to inaugurate a number of trialsin the support field in 1983/84.    In addition to these wider reforms theDepartment continues to play its part in the central programme of &quot;RaynerCoscrutinies and associated efficiency exercises as one means of ensuring thatCOthe sums expended on the support of the Armed Forces represent value formoney.CIVILIAN MANPOWER? Oil508. The number of United Kingdom based civilians provided for in Estimatescuat 1 April 1983, together with those employed and funded separately in theRoyal Ordnance Factory organisation, amounts to 209,000.   Thus since wetook office, United Kingdom based staff in the Ministry of Defence have ^already been reduced by nearly 39,000 (16%).   A further reduction of 9,0005-3CONFIDENTIAL
| % CONFIDENTIALI     is ^ing sought during 1983/84; we are therefore well-placed to achieve the HtE*get of 200,000 United Kingdom based staff set by us for 1 April 1984.Vision is also made in the Estimates for 34,174 locally engaged civilians H^ing overseas at 1 April 1983 and 32,503 at 31 March 1984.    Within the Hdemies in civilian manpower, financial savings of  1.9 million were achieved Hjduring the course of 1981/82 (equivalent to  5.8 million in a full year at Hl98l/82 prices) as a direct result of contracting out work previously under- HtaW by MOD civilian staff, mainly in the area of cleaning services. H5 9- We are presently reviewing our projected manpower requirements, including Hthos- for the Ministry of Defence, for the period April 1984 to April 1988. |H^ results of this review will be promulgated in due course.^SgE PROCUREMENT POLICY510  Chapter Four of the Statement on Defence Estimates 1982 (&quot;Defence Equipment:C 8ts and Choices&quot;) set out the major problem arising from the real increase inC Sts from one generation of defence equipment to the next.    It also spelt Ut       measures being introduced to keep costs within bounds.   Over the pastaU these measures have continued to receive close attention, with the&lt;* maintaining the momentum.   The wider policy issues have been examined n a number of fronts.   During the course of the year the House of Commons^ Committee completed an enquiry into Defence Organisation and Procurement,j   ^ting m a Report which was published in July 1982.   Our detailedVr^ti0ns on this Report were presented to Parliament in Cmnd 8678 of Ct0ber 1982.   The Committee took evidence, both oral and written, from a**ge of witnesses: Ministers, MPs, officials, representatives of industry,5-4CONFIDENTIAL! _1 6u 1
LC93/1CONFIDENTIAL ^and academics.    Their Report identified two major themes arising in thecourse of their enquiry; the increasing emphasis on the Centre of the Ministryof Defence as a source of policy coupled with greater delegation of authorityfor the implementation of that policy; and the increasing need to associatecontractors more closely with the planning of operational requirements. Wewere pleased to note that the Committee generally endorsed the thrust of themeasures which the Ministry has been taking towards these objectives as wellas the progress that has been made towards achieving them.Defence Sales.511.    1982 has proved a successful year for defence sales.   Major orderswere obtained for Rapier, FH70 Howitzers, fast patrol boats, torpedoes andnaval fire control systems.    In the sphere of military services extensionshave been negotiated for important communications and air defence contracts.We expect this growth to continue and estimate that receipts from defencesales in 1983/84 will amount to  2,400 million.   The primary responsibilityfor marketing of their products lies with the defence industries. However,the Ministry of Defence continues to provide a wide range of supportingservices to companies selling overseas in the defence sector.   The DefenceSales Organisation has been restructured to focus this support on majormarket opportunities where assistance to industry is needed most and bringsthe largest returns.   Arrangements have been made to strengthen the market. efltionresearch and strategic planning capabilities of the Defence Sales Organist1-and private sector experience has been brought to bear by secondment fromindustry to fill certain posts.   The Falklands Campaign has provided anopportunity to evaluate the performance of our defence equipment under the5-5CONFIDENTIAL

This experience has already been shared with the Hmanufacturers and should enhance the sales prospects of their equipment in Hthe future.liLl ESTABLISHMENTS512. The R&amp;D establishments continue to play a full part in the drive to HUrease efficiency in the use of resources and to reduce costs. TheCommendations of a Rayner review of administrative and technical support jH^vices are being followed up and work is being contracted out where it is WMdomical to do so.    Thus contracts were awarded in 1982 for the provision ??0f range services at West Freugh and Kirkcudbright.   By these and other^asures the number of staff at establishments has been reduced in the pastyea* by about 1,000, making a reduction of over 4,000 (nearly 16%) since1979.   Studies have shown no overall advantage in a major change in thebalanCe between Government and industrial involvement in the gas turbine6n8ine activity; the National Gas Turbine Establishment (NGTE) was howevera^Wted with the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) in April. Studiesare continuing of greater industrial involvement in rocket motor activityand of the arrangements for transfer from the establishments to the ROFs ofC6rtain research and development functions.   The responsibilities for nuclearPt0curement have been brought together with those of the control of thereaearch programme and Establishments in a single post entitled &quot;Controller RD Establishments, Research and Nuclear&quot; (CERN).513&apos; Although the prime objective of defence R&amp;D must be to support theprogramme, the value of defence-inspired technology to industry5-6CONFIDENTIAL

Chatham naval base, including the dockyard, is toCl Se on 31 March 1984.   The reduction of Portsmouth dockyard to the status   a fleet operating and maintenance base, which was to have been completed^       same date, was interrupted by the Falklands crisis.   We are now makingdements to complete this change by 30 September 1984.   The Gibraltar* Ck**d is to close later this year, and we are engaged in discussions withthe G vernment 0f Gibraltar about the possibility of the dockyard subsequentlyunder commercial management.

% CONFIDENTIALI ESSAYI                                               MANAGEMENT OF DEFENCE I. 1.     The Ministry of Defence is principally concerned with the management |I of Physical resources rather than the performance of advisory, regulatory |I  r legislative functions.    In this it differs from most other Whitehall |I Departments.   The sheer scale and diversity of this task, ranging across |I the three Service organisations and the Procurement Executive presents |I daunting problems of control and direction.    A clear management policy is |&apos; essential. &apos;&apos; 2&apos;    The Ministry of Defence&apos;s management policy can be summarised as: |&apos;         a.     strong central control of defence policy and resource alloca- |tion;&apos; b.     Overall coordination of the activities of the three Services and|the Procurement Executive;c     Day to day management exercised by the Service Boards and |Procurement Executive Management Board; Id.     Delegation of authority to line managers as far as possible for |the efficient and effective use of resources to meet centrally set |targets; &apos;5-10CONFIDENTIAL^A^^ _1Z G
CONFIDENTIALe. Good management audit to help achieve an optimum balance between|effectiveness and economy. I3. The central control of policy and resource allocation is achieved I| through an annual costing of the Defence Programme the Long Term Costing, I| which provides the basis for Ministers to take decisions on the main Iissues of defence policy. It is also the means by which resources are Iallocated to defence capabilities. This central control of the defence I| budget has been further strengthened in recent years by the revised I| Ministerial structure and the new Chief of Defence Staff&apos;s organisation I| (described in last year&apos;s statement on the Defence Estimates). With the I| same aim, the work of the central equipment committees has also been Ireorganised by concentrating their efforts on a smaller number of key I| defence projects. 1 ,__i4. It is an important responsibility of Ministers and senior management || to ensure that the objectives and priorities of defence policy are trans- Ilated into effective programmes of action throughout the defence organisation.   Managers at every level must be aware of the functions they shouldm\\u| perform and the value of the resources they manage.    In order to improve|  this aspect of Defence management the MINIS system (The Management Infer| mation System for Ministers and Top Management) is being introduced into ^I  the Department. MINIS will record detailed information about the MinistryMmMof Defence&apos;s activities, costs and performance to provide a basis for .5-11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALMinisters and senior officials to review the work of the Department and to|I decide on future action, including studies leading to changes in organisa-|tion and the deployment of departmental manpower and other resources.ecause the Ministy of Defence is largely executive, the MINIS process is |^eing adapted so that it not only provides detailed information on the |w rk of the mainly office-based headquarters staff but also covers certain|essentail aspects of the wide variety of executive support operations utside the headquarters, such as the Royal Dockyards, stores, depots,w rkshops, maintenance units, training establishments and R&amp;D establish-|&apos; &quot;&quot;ents. IThe first, experimental, round of MINIS will run from March to July |I 1983  and a quarter of a million Service personnel and civilians and the |Sources they manage will be encompassed by the new system.    The second, |round will take place from August 1983 to March 1984 and will beePeated annually thereafter.   An important feature of the Ministry of |ence MINIS is the way it will link together on the one hand the LongI Y&gt;nCosting process and on the other the management information and 1 systems, such as cost and management accounts, which already cover|1110 81 H  c iQetence support operations.I 6,lt is neither possible nor desirable to exercise central control over|the day to day management of most defence activities, and a high degree f devolved authority is called for.   Although such delegated authority5-12CONFIDENTIAL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ . ICONFIDENTIALis now an established feature of Defence organisation it has not always Ioperated in such a way as to allow line managers to be called fully to I| account for their performance. The Long Term Costing necessarily focusses|| on programmes expressed in terms of input costs and this means that the I| full cost of some defence activities may not be immediately apparent. In I| areas such as Service training for example, where a large number of &apos;| interests interlock, no individual has sole control over all the resources|| consumed. Some overlapping may be unavoidable, but the MINIS process will I| contribute greatly to the establishing of clear lines of accountability I| for all defence activities. &apos;7.     Other recent management reforms have also centred on improving ways Iin which responsibility is defined and distributed.   An important develop&quot;I| ment is the concept of &quot;responsibility budgets&quot;, the essence of which is I|  that selected line managers should accept responsibility for achieving a Ispecified level of performance in a defined area of activity against a I| financial budget.   Under a budget system managers would be made more fully II I b| aware of the cost of the activities they manage and of their responsi&quot; 1I bility for controlling and making the most effective use of their ,I resources.   Managerial tasks and lines of responsibility would be define(* ,I 11| more clearly.    It would also be an aim to develop new and existing ,I a|  indicators against which managers&apos; performance could be measured and togive managers greater freedom, within such constraints as annual cash ,|  limits, to manage the resources needed to achieve their tasks.    The i5-13CONFIDENTIAL
p% CONFIDENTIAL&apos; responsibility budget concept offers considerable potential and its&apos; 8uccessful application to defence support activities would be a major |I ^novation in civil service management.    It is being evaluated in trials |&apos; be8inning in April at the following establishments: IRoyal Navy   RN Aircraft Yard, Fleetlands.Naval Medical Services, including RN Hospitals Haslar,Stonehouse and Institute of Naval Medicine.Army The REME No 34 Central Workshop, Donnington.RAF The Basic Flying Training Schools at Linton on Ouse, |Cranwell and Church Fenton.PE Royal Signals Research Establishment, Malvern. |e scope for introducing responsibility budgets in other areas is also |6inS considered. IA comprehensive system of management inspection and audit is needed |insure that the Department is organised and run at maximum efficiency, |that consistent, acceptable standards of performance prevail through |*   The management audit concept explained more fully in last year s |&quot;?ement is therefore an essential element in management policy.   While |5-14CONFIDENTIAL1 i 0 P

Considerable economies have already been achieved || in recent years, especially in the area of civilian manpower, where the I|  target set for the Department requires a reduction of 19% which compares I| with an average of 11% for the rest of the Civil Service.   Continuous Ipressure is needed to ensure that taut manning is maintained everywhere I|  and this will be exercised through the allocation of individual staff Ibudgets. &apos;| 9.     The evolution of Defence management policy is taking place against I|  the background of reforms throughout the Civil Service.   The measures Ibeing taken reflect the management principles set out in the Government II  observations on &quot;Efficiency and Effectiveness in the Civil Service&quot;LHI  (Cmnd 8616) and it is important to view them in this wider perspectivei| rather than as isolated responses to particular defence needs.   The &apos;| Ministry of Defence is one of the leaders in the movement within Whitehall Ito improve financial accountability and the work has been given a new Iimpetus by the Government&apos;s Financial Management Initiative which will]serve as a means to coordinate efforts towards greater management effici&quot;i| ency and maintain the progress already made.&apos; :&apos; :5-15CONFIDENTIAL
