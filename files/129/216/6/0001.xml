ANNUAL REVIEW OF AGRICULTURE 1983INTRODUCTION1. This White Paper sets out the data considered during the AnnualReview of the economic condition and prospects of the United Kingdomagricultural industry. The Government will draw on this information,as appropriate, when considering proposals by the European Commissionfor agricultural support in 1983/84 and when decisions are taken on supportarrangements which remain within our national competence. As usual,these decisions will be announced separately. In most cases the forecastsfor 1982 were made in November 1982.PART I-STATE OF THE INDUSTRY2. Growing conditions in 1982 were favourable. Crops yieldedparticularly well and livestock also benefited. Net product at constantprices, which measures in volume terms the contribution from agricultureto the corresponding net national product, rose by 10% largely due to therecord cereals harvest. The average prices paid for the industry&apos;s inputsand obtained for its outputs increased by around 7%. Pre-interest farmingincome of farmers and their spouses, which is the sum of farming incomeand interest, rose by 35%. Pre-interest income of farm households, whichalso includes the returns to family workers, rose by 29%. Farming incomealone is forecast to rise by 45%. When deflated by the Retail Price Index(RPI) these measures show a substantial recovery in real terms in 1982following a smaller rise in 1981 and a significant decline in 1980, but theystill have not returned to levels achieved in the mid 1970s. The volumeof new fixed investment in the industry is expected to increase by 17%.3. Cereals yields and quality were generally better than in 1981 andproduction reached 21.8 million tonnes, a new record. Production of oilseedrape increased by 68% to a record level of about 570,000 tonnes. Plantingsof potatoes were less than in 1981 but yields were close to or above recordlevels resulting in appreciably higher production. The sugar beet cropwas expected to yield a record output of at least 1.3 million tonnes of whitesugar. The area devoted to horticultural crops showed a small decline.4. The dairy herd was nearly 2% larger at June 1982 than a yearearlier and milk production is expected to increase by nearly 5%. Thebeef breeding herd fell by about l-J-% and home-fed production of beef isexpected to be about 4% lower than in 1981. The sheep breeding flockcontinued to increase and the production of sheepmeat is expected to bealmost 6% higher than in 1981. Pigmeat production is forecast to benearly 3% higher than in 1981. The rise in chick placings is expected toresult in production of poultrymeat increasing by about 10%. Egg produc-tion is likely to be only slightly above the 1981 level.145398 B*2
PART II-GENERAL DEVELOPMENTSFarm structure  (Table 4)5. The decline in the number of farms in the United Kingdomcontinues. In 1982 the total number of holdings was about 242,300 some2% lower than in 1977. The fall in numbers continued to be greatestamong the smaller full-time businesses. Half the total number of holdingshad businesses capable of providing work for at least one full-time man(ie those of 250 standard man-days or more) and these accounted forabout 90% of total output. Large businesses of 1,000 standard man-daysor more, whilst only about 13% of the total number, accounted for somehalf the total output. In Northern Ireland and Wales the output fromsmall-scale farms is rather more significant than in other parts of the UnitedKingdom.6. The average area (including rough grazing) of the full-time businessof 250 standard man-days or more has risen by about 4% since 1977 to118 hectares. With the exception of breeding sheep flocks the number ofenterprises continues to fall; the expansion in the size of individualenterprises continues. There has been an increase in the last five years inthe average area devoted to cereals from 33 to 40 hectares (21%) and anincrease of about 2.3 hectares (16%) in the average area of sugar beet.In the same period, the average dairy herd increased by some 22% to55 cows, and the average size of the ewe flock by about 9% to 188. Theaverage beef cow herd has stabilised in recent years at about 18 cows.Herd sizes in the pig sector have risen sharply between 1977 and 1982with herds of breeding pigs having increased on average from 27 to 39(44%) and herds of fattening pigs from 186 to 259 (39%).7. In Great Britain 68% of the holdings were wholly or mainly owner-occupied in 1982 compared with 54% in 1960/61. The proportion ofagricultural land which is farmed by its owner has increased from 52%in 1960/61 to 59% in 1981. In Northern Ireland virtually all farmers areowner-occupiers.Output  (Table 22)8. Gross output is forecast to rise by  1,353 million (14%) to  11,145million in 1982 compared with a rise of  796 million (9%) between 1980and 1981. The overall volume of output as measured by the index ofgross output at constant 1975 prices is expected to rise to 119 in 1982compared with a level of 112 in 1981. This rise is the result of anincrease in production of most commodities, including marked increases inthe output of cereals, other farm crops, milk and an increase in end-yearstocks on farms. Overall, the price of outputs is expected to rise by about7% between 1981 and 1982, with increases of around 6% for cereals,11% for cattle and calves and 8% for milk and milk products. The valueof the output of cereals is expected to rise by 16% and that of all farmcrops by 17%. The values of output for horticultural products, livestockand livestock products are expected to rise by 6%, 9% and 10%respectively.^1
Input  (Table 22)9. Gross input for 1982 is expected to rise by  534 million (10%) to 5,725 million compared with an increase of  328 million (7%) between1980 and 1981. The overall volume of inputs as measured by the indexof gross input at constant 1975 prices is expected to show an increase to104 compared with 101 in 1981. Within gross input the largest item,purchased feedingstuffs, is expected to rise by about 8% in 1982: expen-diture on fertilisers is expected to rise by 6% and on fuel and oil by 18%.The price of bought-in goods and services increased by just under 7%between 1981 and 1982, with fuel and oil rising by 15%.Gross and net product  (Tables 22 and 23)10. Gross product, which is gross output less gross input, is forecastto be  5,420 million in 1982, an increase of 18% over 1981. The allowancemade for depreciation of capital items rose by  75 million (6%). Netproduct, which is a measure of the value added by the agricultural industryto all goods and services purchased from outside agriculture, after allowancehas been made for depreciation, rose by  383 million (13%) between 1980and 1981 and is expected to rise by a further  745 million (22%) to 4,139 million in 1982. The index of net product at constant prices(1975 = 100), which was 128 in 1980 and 129 in 1981 is expected to riseto a new record level of 142 in 1982. Since the depressed level of 1976, netproduct has increased substantially but in an irregular fashion.Aggregate income  (Tables 22 and 23)11. Net product represents the sum of various types of income. Outof it the agricultural industry must pay its labour force and pay the intereston its borrowings, as well as provide for expenditure on net rent. In 1982the labour bill for hired and family workers is expected to rise by  125million (8%), an increase in wage rates being partly offset by a smallreduction in the number of workers employed. Net rent, a relatively smallitem, is expected to rise by  18 million (23%) and interest payments by  27million (6%). The net farming income of farmers and their spouses, whichis the balance left after making these deductions, is forecast to rise by  574million (45%) to  1,849 million in 1982 following a rise of  248 million(24%) from 1980 to 1981. There are a number of alternative more broadlydefined but less volatile income measures which are useful for making anassessment of developments in farming finances. Thus the pre-interestfarming income of farmers and their spouses, which is the sum of farmingincome and interest, rose by 35% between 1981 and 1982, following anincrease of 16% between 1980 and 1981. The pre-interest income of farmhouseholds, which includes the returns to family workers, rose by 29%between 1981 and 1982 and by 15% between 1980 and 1981. Deflated bythe retail price index, all these measures of income therefore show asubstantial recovery in 1982 but they remain below levels achieved in themid 1970s.12. Alternative indicators based upon simple cash flow concepts alsoshow an increase between 1981 and 1982.  For instance the cash flow index3
for farmers and their spouses (ie the revenue accruing to farmers andspouses less cash outlays, including spending on material inputs and servicesand on capital items) is estimated to have risen by 17% between 1981I .    and 1982.Income developments by farm type  (Table 25)13. Further information is provided at the Annual Review fromsamples of farm accounts which examine the financial position of farminganalysed by size and type of farm and by country and region. The coverageand certain of the concepts in this series differ from the aggregatecalculation. No direct comparisons between the two series can therefore bemade. In particular the farm accounts relate to full-time farms only; the&gt;do not cover very large farms (notably in the poultry sector); and the mainanalyses do not cover horticultural holdings. There are differences in thetreatment of stock appreciation and valuations, which can affect the year tcwhich income from individual enterprises is attributed, and interest onfarming loans is not deducted. The sample accounts relate to a yeaiending, on average, in mid-February.14. Information from the farm accounts for 1981/82 (the yeaiending on average in February 1982) indicates that average net incomeper farm rose on almost all farm types in that year and forecasts o:1982/83 results suggest further increases on most types. Higher milk yield;and returns are expected to be reflected in a second year of much improvecincomes on dairy farms throughout the United Kingdom. Substantiaincreases in income on hill and upland farms in 1981/82 are expected to b&lt;maintained generally in 1982/83, but incomes on sheep farms in Scotlammay fall slightly. Incomes on lowland livestock farms increased in 1981/8.&apos;in all countries except England, the improvement being substantial iiNorthern Ireland, though from a very low level, and in Scotland: increasein income, generally modest, are forecast for 1982/83. Incomes on pigs ampoultry farms rose in 1981/82, but are forecast to fall back somewhat ii1982/83.15. Specialist cereals farms in England showed little change in incomiin 1981/82 but a substantial increase is forecast for 1982/83 reflecting threcord cereals harvest. On general cropping farms, where incomes are heavil;influenced by the price of potatoes, incomes showed substantial gains ii1981/82 (average net income in Scotland in the previous year wanegative) but little change is expected in 1982/83.16. The overall picture emerging from the farm accounts is that o:many of the main farm types incomes in 1982/83 are forecast to showcontinued recovery in real terms from their levels in recent years buwithout returning to levels prevailing in the mid 1970s.Labour productivity  (Tables 5 and 23)17. The index of labour productivity measures changes in gross agricutural product at constant prices, per person engaged. It reflects improvemenlin, for example, plant and animal breeding and in the organisation c
farming, the reduction in the number of persons engaged and short-termmovements in output caused by factors such as the weather. During the 10years to 1981 the index increased on average by about 3% annually. Anincrease of over 9% is forecast for 1982. This reflects an increase ofnearly 9% in gross agricultural product at constant prices and a reduction inthe number of persons engaged of somewhat less than 1%. The numberof regular whole-time workers fell by 2% between 1981 and 1982 comparedwith an annual average reduction of about 4% in the 10 years to 1981.Gross capital formation  (Table 20)18. It is estimated that the value of new investment will rise sharply in1982, with the industry&apos;s gross capital formation in fixed assets of  1,150million some 20% higher than in 1981. Investment in buildings and worksis expected to be  585 million, a rise of 14% compared with the 1981 level,while investment in plant, machinery and vehicles is expected to rise by26% to  565 million. In volume terms, new investment in buildings andworks is forecast to increase by some 16% and that in plant, machinery andvehicles by about 19%. The expected increase in the volume of total grossfixed capital formation is 17%. After allowing for depreciation the net stockof these assets remains unchanged at broadly the level of recent years.19. The value of the physical increase in stocks and work-in-progressshowed a significant rise in 1982 due largely to the increase in stocks of farmcrops, particularly of cereals. The volume of breeding livestock capitalformation showed a small increase in 1981 but is expected to show asignificant rise in 1982 following forecast increases in the number ofbreeding animals.Bank borrowings20. Bank advances outstanding to agriculture in 1982 arc forecast toaverage about  4,000 million, some 18% higher than the average for1981. The rate of increase in bank borrowings has again declined probablyreflecting the easier cash flow position and it is probable that the decline inthe rate of growth would have been more marked but for the recovery in1982 in new investment. Information from the balance sheets of a sample offull-time farm businesses in the Farm Management Survey suggests thatexternal liabilities represent about one-fifth of the total business assets oftenanted farms in England and Wales and about one-tenth of the assetsof owner-occupied and mixed tenure farms.Agricultural land prices  (Table 24)21. Following the general rise in all agricultural land prices between1973 and 1979, prices of vacant possession and tenanted land have heldfairly steady in England but have fallen in Wales, Scotland and NorthernIreland. Information from the comprehensive Inland Revenue series indicatesthat the average price per hectare of agricultural land sold with vacantpossession in 1981 was  3,418 in England,  2,118 in Wales,  1,677 in Scotlandand  2,897 in Northern Ireland. The more up-to-date but less comprehensive
Current Agricultural Land Prices series, which covers England and Walesonly, indicates that vacant possession prices during 1982 were generallyslightly higher in England but lower in Wales than in 1981.Farm rents  (Table 24)22. On the basis of the provisional results of the ADAS Annual RentEnquiry in England and Wales and of continuing field surveys in Scotlandaverage farm rents in Great Britain are forecast to have increased by 12-7%in 1982. This compares with an increase of 15-6% in 1981.Farm workers&apos; earnings  (Table 21)23. Weekly earnings of whole-time hired men in the United Kingdomaveraged  96.29 for 46.3 hours in the calendar year 1981 compared with 85.95 for 45.7 hours in the calendar year 1980, an increase of 10.6% inaverage hourly earnings. Average weekly earnings in 1982 are forecast tobe about  105.75 for 46.2 hours, a further increase of 10.1%. The statutoryminimum weekly wage rates were increased by just over 7% for adultregular whole-time hired workers in England and Wales from 20 January1983, by 7.8% for general workers in Scotland from 7 February 1983 andby 7.1% for agricultural workers in Northern Ireland from 7 February 1983.Public expenditure  (Table 26)24. Expenditure in the United Kingdom on market regulation under theCommon Agricultural Policy is estimated to be about  1,006 million in1982/83 compared with some  678 million in 1981/82. This expenditureincludes the butter and school milk subsidies, the beef and sheepmeatvariable premium schemes, the premium schemes for the noh-marketing ofmilk and for the conversion of dairy herds, the suckler cow premiumscheme, the annual premium on ewes, export refunds, certain productionsubsidies, aids to animal feeds, aids to private storage and the cost ofpurchasing commodities into intervention less proceeds from sales. Receiptsfrom the milk co-responsibility levy, sheepmeat clawback and levies onintra-community trade are netted off against this expenditure some of whichbenefits consumers and trade interests rather than producers. The additionalexpenditure in 1982/83 is mainly due to increased purchases into interventionof cereals, beef, skimmed milk powder and butter and to increased paymentsof the oilseeds subsidy. These increases are partly offset by reducedexpenditure on exports to third countries and by increased receipts fromlevies on intra-community trade.25. Expenditure in the United Kingdom on price guarantees, productiongrants and subsidies, capital grants and support for agriculture in specialareas (excluding brucellosis incentives and horticultural protected cropsadaptation aid) is estimated to be  327 million in 1982/83 compared with 294 million in 1981/82. This increase reflects the introduction of theNorthern Ireland Agricultural Development Programme which came intooperation on 1 April 1982.26. A breakdown of expenditure by scheme and commodity is set out inTable 26.6
PART III-COMMODITY TRENDSCereals  (Tables 3, 6, 8 and 27)27. In 1982 cereals were grown on 4.03 million hectares, a net increaseof almost 50,000 hectares over 1981. A fall of 120,000 hectares in the areasown to barley and oats was more than offset by an increase of about 170,000hectares in the wheat area. Yields and quality were generally better thanin 1981. Production of all cereals reached about 21.8 million tonnes, over2.0 million tonnes more than in 1981 and a record for the third year running.Prices were generally close to support levels in the first half of 1982. Sincethe start of the new crop year, barley prices have settled below the supportlevel and bread wheat prices have been slow to pick up. These developments,combined with a lack of export opportunities for barley in the early part ofthe season, have led to record sales into intervention. By end-Decemberoffers of barley had reached 1.1 million tonnes and were continuing at areduced rate. Offers of bread wheat in the August-October interventionperiod reached nearly 730,000 tonnes and a higher proportion passed theprescribed tests than in 1980 or 1981. The sowing of winter cereals startedwell but was delayed by wet conditions in October.Oilseed rape  (Tables 3, 6, 9 and 27)28. The area of oilseed rape in 1982 increased by 39% to 174,000hectares. Following below average yields in 1981, record yields of 3.3tonnes/hectare are estimated for the 1982 crop. This together with thesubstantial increase in area sown is expected to result in a record productionof about 570,000 tonnes in 1982. The area under the 1983 crop is expectedto be higher than in 1982 and a further large increase in production is likely.Market prices in 1982 were firm and only a token quantity was sold intointervention.Potatoes  (Tables 3, 6, 10 and 27)29. Plantings in 1982 were some 3,000 hectares less than the UnitedKingdom target area of 194,000 hectares. Planting and growing conditionswere generally very favourable with the result that yields were close to orabove the record levels of 1980. Production was, therefore, appreciablyhigher than last year while prices were significantly lower. The PotatoMarketing Board was again authorised to offer contracts to producers inGreat Britain for a proportion of their crop with the aim of ensuringstability in the market throughout the season. Over 517,000 tonnes ofpotatoes were placed under contract in this way.30. Discussions on future support and marketing arrangements arecontinuing.Sugar beet  (Tables 3, 6, 11 and 27)31. In 1982 British Sugar pic contracted to purchase sugar beet from204,000 hectares compared with 212,000 hectares in 1981. Weather duringthe growing season was very favourable: sowing and establishment of the145398 c*
?Sicrop took place in very good conditions. This produced a crop ofexceptionally high root weight and fairly high sugar content. Heavy rainfallduring the early part of the harvest delayed lifting, but given favourableconditions the crop should yield a record quantity of at least 1.3 milliontonnes of white sugar. This exceeds the maximum quota for the UnitedKingdom set under the Community sugar regime. As sugar producedbeyond the maximum quota does not qualify for price support this willreduce the average price paid for sugar beet. The contract price for 1983,based on Commission proposals for a 4% increase in support prices inthe sugar sector, has been set at  26.11 per tonne. This price is to applyto all sugar beet used to produce the United Kingdom maximum sugarquota plus 104,000 tonnes of non quota or &quot; C &quot; sugar.Horticulture  (Tables 3, 6, 12 and 27)32. It is not practicable to deal individually with the whole range ofhorticultural crops grown commercially in the United Kingdom. Theseparagraphs concentrate on certain crops in significant production hereincluding those subject to Community internal market arrangements (apples,pears, cauliflowers and tomatoes).33. The area devoted to horticulture in 1982 was about 253,000 hectarescompared with 255,000 hectares in 1981. This represents a smaller decreasethan in recent years.34. Production of apples in the 1982 growing season was substantiallyhigher than in 1981 but production of pears was lower. To encourage appleand pear growers to replace old orchards with varieties in demand on themarket the Government intend, subject to Parliamentary approval, to providegrants for a 5-year period from 1 April 1983. Weather conditions affectedsoft fruit production, particularly of strawberries, resulting in over-supplyin a shorter marketing season.35. The severe winter caused damage to the over-wintered cauliflowercrop amongst others and the marketing season was shorter than usual.Frost and drought reduced supplies of the early summer crop, althoughthere were periods of over-supply in the late summer.36. Growers of protected crops continued to face strong competitionfrom imports from the Netherlands. The 1982 unheated tomato cropdeveloped early and supplies were concentrated more than usual in theperiod when imports were at their greatest.37. Low apple and pear production in 1981 kept prices high in early1982, but plentiful supplies from the new season&apos;s apple crop took pricesfrom August onwards well below 1981 levels. Competition from importsof dessert apples remained strong. Withdrawals of 1982 season apples areexpected to be high and preventive withdrawals have been authorised.Despite lower production, prices of pears at the beginning of the seasonwere lower than in 1981. Wholesale prices of cauliflowers were high inearly 1982 but prices for summer cauliflowers were generally lower thanin 1981 and some withdrawals took place. Tomato prices for most of 1982were generally lower than those of the previous year due to over-supplied8
markets. Cut flowers suffered a general lack of demand and this togetherwith increased competition from imports tended to keep prices down through-out the year.  Government aid totalling  9.5 million was made available in1981 and 1982 to help growers of protected crops to meet the increasedcosts of heating oil. Similar aid, worth about  1 million, will be availableon oil used during the period 1 January to 31 March 1983.Hops  (Tables 3, 6, 13 and 27)38. The area under hops was little changed from 1981. Productionincreased and the crop was of good average quality.   Average prices in1982 were above the levels of 1981.Seeds  (Table 14)39. The area approved in 1982 for production of certified herbage andlegume seed (excluding field bean and pea seed) was substantially down on1981. Yields were average, so production was also well down. The areafor 1983 is expected to be about the same as in 1982. Stocks were againreduced but were adequate. Prices were generally higher than in 1981 witha considerable increase for some species.40. The area approved for production of certified field pea seedcontinued to increase but the field bean seed area was slightly down. NewCommunity legislation affecting seed production aid is expected to resultin a decreased area of both in 1983.Dried peas and beans41. The area sown with peas in 1982 was 28,000 hectares, the same asin 1981 but about 20% below that of the late 1970s. The yield was 3.1tonnes per hectare, similar to that of 1981. The area sown to beans was39,000 hectares, a fall of 14% compared with 1981 but this was more thanoffset by an increase in yields from 2.71 tonnes per hectare to 3.4 tonnesper hectare.42. Prices for both peas and beans have generally been at the minimumlevel necessary to enable processors to qualify for aid under the Communityregime and there have been some disposal problems. This reflects the factthat in this sector no adjustment is made to the rate of aid to offset thedifference between the representative rate for the pound and the market rate.Beef and milk (Tables 3,6,15,16,17 and 27)43. The June 1982 census showed a slight increase in the total UnitedKingdom cattle breeding herd compared with the previous year. The sizeof the United Kingdom beef breeding herd fell by about 1^%, while the dairyherd, which accounts for almost 70% of all breeding cows, increased bynearly 2%. Within this there was a somewhat larger increase in Wales andNorthern Ireland; in Scotland the increase of \\% was the first of anysignificance for nine years. The size of the national dairy herd in 1983 isexpected to increase marginally.9145398 c*2
44. Home-fed production of beef in 1982 is expected to be about 4%lower than in 1981 with exports falling by about 30% and imports by about8%. Total new supplies are expected to be only slightly below 1981 levels.Average market prices for certified cattle were close to or above lOOp/live kgin the first half of the year, but declined seasonally to about 95p/live kg atthe end of September. Variable premiums were paid from the beginningof the 1982/83 marketing year and continued at modest levels for mostweeks until the end of September when market prices strengthened andmoved above the target level. During November, market prices increasedmore slowly than the target price and small amounts of variable premiumagain became payable at the end of that month. Total intervention purchasesbetween 1 January 1982 and 30 September 1982 were 7,400 tonnes, repre-senting less than 1% of total supplies. Most intervention purchases tookplace in Northern Ireland.45. The average yield of milk per cow in 1982 is expected to be some3^% higher than in 1981 when yields were low as a result of poor weather.The improved yield and the increase in size of the national dairy herd areexpected to lead to an increase of nearly 5% in milk production for theyear as a whole. The amount of milk sold for liquid consumption in 1982is expected to fall by \\%. This, together with the rise in total production,is expected to result in an increase of over 10% in the volume of milkavailable for manufacturing. Milk used for cheese production in 1982 isexpected to fall slightly, but milk used for butter production is expectedto increase by over 20%.46. Producer returns for milk are determined by the Milk MarketingBoards on the basis of their returns from the liquid and manufacturing milkmarkets. The five Boards&apos; average net returns from all milk for the 1982/83year are expected to be between 16.0 ppl and 16.5 ppl with net returns tothe England and Wales Board being between 16.0 ppl to 16.3 ppl and thoseto the Northern Ireland Board about 0.9 ppl lower than this. These figurestake into account the increase in the retail price of liquid milk of lp per pintfrom 14 November 1982. In Scotland, the Board&apos;s first-hand selling pricesfor liquid milk were left to be determined from 1 April 1982 by the respectiveJoint Committees within a statutory ceiling set by the Government. Netreturns from all milk vary slightly between areas in Scotland, but are expectedto be between 16.2 ppl and 16.5 ppl.Sheep and wool  (Tables 3,15,19 and 27)47. The breeding flock increased by over 3% between June 1981 andJune 1982, a similar increase to the previous year. A further small increase isexpected in 1983.48. Home-fed production of sheepmeat is expected to be almost 6%higher in 1982 than in 1981 following another above average lambing rate.Total supplies to the market are expected to rise by about 18%, with anincrease in imports of around 32% and a decline in exports of 2%. Theaverage level of prices was about 2% above that of 1981. The overall levelof returns to producers rose by 15.2%. Sheep variable premium was paidon a regular basis from May onwards in Great Britain, but not in Northern10
Ireland where since 20 May 1982 support has been entirely through theannual ewe premium. The first payments of annual ewe premium for the1982/83 marketing year were made in November following a recovery forover-payment during the previous marketing year. Average prices for storelambs and draft ewes in Great Britain continued to rise although there wasa fall in store prices in Northern Ireland.49. Wool production fell by about 2\% in 1982. The guaranteed priceremained at the level of the previous two years. Final payments to producersare expected to be slightly lower than in 1981 because of a small increase inthe deduction for marketing costs by the British Wool Marketing Board.Average market prices for the 1982 clip are expected to remain below theguaranteed price. Exchequer advances to the Board have continued.Pigs  (Tables 3, 15 and 27)50. Pigmeat production in 1982 is expected to be nearly 3% above the1981 level. Very high prices at the beginning of the year were not sustainedbut prices were on average about 4% above 1981 levels. A further increasein production is expected in 1983 reflecting the expansion in the breedingherd during 1982.Poultrymeat  (Tables 3,15 and 27)51. The upward trend in placings of both broiler chicks and turkeypoults has continued. Production of poultrymeat in 1982 is expected to beabout 10% higher than in 1981 and to remain at this level in 1983. Therewas little change in the overall level of imports of poultrymeat in 1982because substantially increased sendings of chicken from Denmark offsetreduced supplies from other sources. Prices for turkeymeat during 1982 areexpected to be considerably above the 1981 level but there is expected to beonly a small increase in prices for chicken.Eggs  (Tables 3,6, 18 and 27)52. Despite a small recovery in chick placings in 1981 the laying flockin 1982 should be at the same level as the previous year. The declining trendin placings over recent years is expected to resume and lead to a slight fall inthe laying flock during 1983. Output in 1982 is likely to be only marginallyabove the 1981 level and there may be a small reduction in 1983. There wasa decline in imports of eggs in 1982 but, following the easing of animal healthrestrictions, there is likely to be some increase in 1983.  Average prices for1982 are expected to be more than 3% lower than for 1981.11
APPENDIXSTATISTICAL TABLESThe tables cover largely the same ground as those in last year&apos;s White Paper except that:(a) a new Table (No. 2) presents in a more comprehensive fashion the indices formerlyincluded in Table 1;(b) Table 11 (sugar supplies) has been expanded so as to show more clearly the relationshipbetween beet yields and sugar production;(c) Table 25 (farm accounts) has been re-ordered so as to bring together the data forsimilar types of farm.Even where there has been no change in the basis of the tables, some of the figures in thisappendix differ from those in previous Annual Review White Papers because of later informa-tion, changes in the scope and nature of available data and improvements in statistical methods.The forecasts for 1982 generally reflect the position up to the end of the year, as seen atNovember 1982. In some instances trade data for 1981 have been estimated because finalOverseas Trade Statistics for that year were not available at the time the tables were compiled.All figures relate to the United Kingdom, unless otherwise stated.Figures for imports from and exports to the Nine relate throughout to the other countriesof the European Community (Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, France,Greece, the Irish Republic, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands).Significant items of Channel Islands trade are shown separately in the tables. Figuresfor exports include re-exports.In some cases figures may not add up to the totals shown because of roundings.Symbols:- means &quot; nil &quot;... means &quot; negligible &quot; (less than half the last digit shown).. means &quot; not available &quot; or &quot; not applicable &quot;.13

Table 3 {continued)(a) The data in this table vary between the different countries as follows:-England and Wales: For nil years the figures relate to all known agricultural holdings including minorholdings (previously called statistically insignificant holdings).Scotland: The figures for 1971 to 1973 relate to agricultural holdings with n labour requirement of 26standard man-days or more. (a standard man-day (smd) represents 8 hours&apos; productive work by an adultworker under average conditions.) The raising of the threshold from 26 to 40 smd in 1973 resulted inthe exclusion of some 5 000 minor holdings and in 1977 a further 1 700 holdings were excluded. Sincethen the Scottish figures relate to all known agricultural holdings with 40 smd or more.Northern Ireland: The figure.* for 1971 and 1972 relate to holdings of 0.4 hectares (one acre) or more andin the case of livestock to all owners of livestock. From 1973 to 1980 the figures relate to all holdingswith (i) 40 smd or more, or (ii) 4 hectares or more of total area, or (iii) one or more regular full-time workers(excluding the owner). The change between 1972 and 1973 resulted in the net deletion of some 6 000holdings. The figures for 1981 onwards relate to all holdings with: (i) one European Size Unit (ESU)or more (sec footnote (t) to Table 25), or (ii) 6 hectares or more of total area, or (iii) one or more full-timeworkers (excluding the owner). This change between 1980 and 1981 resulted in the deletion of a further7 000 holding? but their exclusion has had an insignificant effect on the cropping and stocking figures.(b) Cereals for thrashing, excluding maize.(c) Collected separately in Scotland from 1982.(d) Includes small area of soft fruit grown under orchard trees in EnglanJ and Wales.(e) Hardy nursery stock, bulbs and flowers.(/) Most of the difference between total horticultural area and the sum of individual sectors is made up by theglasshouse area.{S) Includes area of other crops and baie fallow not shown in the table.(A) Includes lucerne.(/) Before 1975 collected as:In England and Wales- &quot; clover, sninfoin and temporary grassesIn Scotland -** grass under 7 years oldIn Northern Ireland  -&quot; grass 1st, 2nd and 3rd vear &quot;.(J) Before 1975 collected a*:In England and Wales-&quot; permanent grassIn Scotland -&quot; grass 7 yeirs old and over &quot;jIn Northern Ireland  -11 grass 4th year or older &quot;.(A) Returns of&quot; other land &quot; were collected for the first time in England and Wales in June 1969. From June1969 to June 1973 &quot; other land &quot; in Gieat Britain was collected as woodland and areas under roads, yards,buildings, etc., the use of which was ancillary to farming of the land; in Northern Ireland it included landwithin agricultural holdings which were under bog, water, roads, buildings, etc., and waste land not usedfor agriculture. In June 1974 the definition was changed in England and Wales to include all other landforming part of the holding and in Scotland it was extended to include ponds and derelict land.

The figuresfor 1977 have been adjusted to take account of the reappraisal of minor holdings in England and Waleswhich resulted in a further 11 000 holdinas being removed from the June 1980 census. The removal of some7 000 such holding* from the census in Northern Ireland between June 1980 and June 1981 (sec note (a) toTable 3) has no significant effect on tnis Table. The Northern Ireland figures in the first two sections ofthe Table include only holdings with 50 smd or more which were only slightly affected by the change, as werethe quantities of crops and stock in the other sections of the Table. The decline in the total number ofholdings is reflected in the smallest size group and has marginally increased the average size of some enterprises.Caution must be exercised in comparing these figures with those quoted in recent White Papers and in particularwith figures in White Papers published prior to the 1978 Review when results were based on imperial measure-ments and old smd values.(6) The average size of holdings based on total area was:1977 70.7 hectares of which 67.8% was under crops and grass1982     72.0 hectares of which 68.5 v&quot; was under crops and grass.(c) These figures include holdings with no crops and grass which are excluded from the first section of the Table.(d) With the introduction of revised smd values for the 1978 Annual Review the figures shown in this Table areonly comparable with those in the White Papers for 1978 onwards (but see note (a) above).(e) Figures relate to England and Wales only.(/) Figures included for Scotland relate to December censuses in 1976 and 1981 and for Northern Ireland to theDecember 1976 and June 1982 censuses.(g) Figures included for Northern Ireland relate to pig holdings which had fattening pigs only.(A) Figures for Scotland and Northern Ireland include small numbers of other table fowls.20

Wives/husbands of farmers, partners and directors engagedin farm work were returned separately in 1977. Figures for earlier years exclude this category and this isthought to explain the decrease in the number of regular whole-time and part-time female workers from1977 onwards.Figures include estimates for all minor holdings (previously called statistically insignificant holdings) inEngland and Wales not surveyed in the respective June censuses (see footnote (a) to Table 3).(ft) Figures relate to Great Britain only.(c) Includes seasonal or casual workers in Northern Ireland.   See footnote (a&quot;).(d) Before 1975 seasonal or casual workers were not returned as a separate item in Northern Ireland, but wereincluded with part-time workers.21

In addition, the series shown for Scotland refer to equipped farms ?only and exclude sales of unequipped land, whole estates, land sold for afforestation and inter-family sales. HThere is a delay between the date on which a sale is agreed and the date on which it is included in the series. [The delay is thought to average about 6-9 months in England and Wales and about 3 months in Northern HIreland. The average prices shown in the table for each calendar year relate to sales included in the scries Hfor these countries in the years ending in the following September and March respectively. In the case of IScotland, the problem is overcome by further analysis of information by date of sale. The data for Scotland Hand Northern Ireland arc subject to retrospective revision.(b) The indices of average rents for England and Wales arc based on an annual rent enquiry and for Scotland on Hcontinuing field surveys.   In Northern Ireland very little land is rented except under the conacre system.(c) The figures for the most recent years are subject to revision as detailed below:Agricultural Land PricesScotland: figures for the most recent years are based on sales notified up to September 1982.Northern Ireland: figures for the most recent years arc based on sales notified up to September 1982.

Table 25 (continued)Notes(a) This series is derived from figures collected in Farm Management Surveys by Universities and AgriculturalColleges in Great Britain and by the Deportment of Agriculture in Northern Ireland. The figures are averagesweighted by the census distribution of agricultural holdings by type of farming and size of business. Moredetailed figures for England will be published in &quot;Farm Incomes in England 1981-82 &quot;, for Scotland in&quot; Economic Report on Scottish Agriculture 1982 &quot;, for Wales in the &quot; Welsh Agricultural Statistics 1981-82Supplement&quot; and for Northern Ireland in a publication by the Department of Agriculture for NorthernIreland.(6) Net income is the return to the farmer and spouse for their manual and managerial labour and the returnon tenant-type capital in crops, livestock, machinery, etc., but excluding land and buildings. It is calculatedbefore deduction of interest on any farming loans. All farms arc treated as reined and an imputed rentalvalue for owner-occupied land is charged as an expense in the accounts. Stocks of crops and livestock onfarms at the beginning and end of the accounting year arc valued at current market prices and net incomeincludes stock appreciation except thai arising on breeding cattle, sheep and pigs. The accounts relate mainlyto calendar years or years ending 5 April and the average year-ending date is about mid-February. (Almostall farm businesses in Northern Ireland are based on owner-occupied holdings. As rents cannot be imputedwith reference to tenanted farms, the rental charges entered for owned land and buildings have been assessedin relation to estimated sale value. Where land was taken in conacre, the actual rents paid have been included.For these reasons the average net incomes per farm are not on the same basis as those for Great Britain.)(c) The data relate to full-time farms. The measurement of farm business size is based on standard gross marginsper unit of crop area and per head of livestock, measured in European Size Units (ESU) with 1 ESU equalling1 000 European units of account of standard gross margins at average 1972-1974 values. See CommissionDecision 78/463/EEC. The data shown refer to the following size groups: England, 4-249.9 ESU; Wales,4-99.9 ESU; Scotland, 8-99.9 ESU; Northern Ireland, 4-39.9 ESU except LFA and Non LFA beef cattleand sheep which are 4-15.9 ESU.(&lt;/) In Wales &quot; lowland cattle and sheep &quot; includes &quot; lowland cropping, cattle and sheep &quot;. In Scotland &quot; crop-ping &quot; comprises &quot; general cropping &quot; and &quot; specialist cereals &quot;. More generally, there are some minordifferences between the definitions of the farming types in the four countries.Table 26Public expenditure under the CAP and on national grants and subsidies (a)April/March (financial) years   million1978/79 1979/80 1980/81 1981/82 1982/83(b) (b) (forecast)I Market regulation under the CAP(i) Expenditure by the Inter-vention Board for Agri-cultural Produce (c)Cereals ...... 28.9 43.0 157.2 242.7 373.8Beef and veal       ..      .. -20.8 10.3 131.6 41.8 52.1Pigmeat ...... 0.2 0.5 -16.7 -33.0 -54.4Sugar........ 84.7 44.6 21.3 35.6 47.6Processed products         .. 21.0 27.8 16.7 16.7 26.4Milk products      ..      .. 198.4 201.3 187.0 168.8 321.5Oilseeds ...... 9.9 19.5 50.6 51.2 80.3Sheepmeat...... - - 42.3 72.2 78.2Others (d)...... 7.9 12.9 13.2 16.4 21.2Total (i)        ..      ..      330.2       359.9       603.2       612.4 946.7(ii) Expenditure by the Agri-culture DepartmentsMilk Non-Marketing Pre-miums ...... 7.1 15.8 30.5 21.2 16.7Suckler    Cow PremiumScheme...... - - 14.6 16.9 16.8Annual Premium on Ewes.. - - - 28.1 26.0Total (ii)       ..      ..        7.1        15.8        45.1        66.2 59.5Total I...... 337.3       375.7      648.3      678.6    1 006.2Against which receipts fromEAGGF...... 312.2      384.3       572.6      698.6 672.943

Table 26 (continued)(a) This table excludes expenditure which may benefit farmers but where the value to them is not shown by theexpenditure (e.g. expenditure on animal disease and pest control or on research, advice and education).Expenditure on agriculture in Noilhcrn Ireland, borne on the Northern Ireland Consolidated Fund, is alsoexcluded. It does, however, include some expenditure which benefits consumers and trade interests ratherthan producers. The figures for years up to and including 1980-81 represent uctual expenditure recordedin the Appropriation Accounts. The figures for 1981-82 arc subject to confirmation and those for 1982-83are the latest estimates of expenditure.(6) Expenditure in 1979-80 includes payments which were due in 1978-79 but were delayed by industrial action.(c) The figures arc made up of several elements and include refunds on intra-Community trade, import andexport refunds on third country trade, the beef premium and sheep variable premium schemes, aid for privatestorage and animal feed, certain production subsidies and the cost of purchasing commodities into interventionless proceeds from sales. The figures also take account of other receipts treated as negative expenditure,namely monetary compensatory amounts levied on intra-Community trade, sheepmeat clawback and theco-responsibility levy on milk producers. The figures include the EC butter subsidy and the UK share ofthe EC school milk subsidy scheme.(d) Includes eggs, poultrymcat, fruit and vegetables, hops, herbage seeds, dried fodder, peas and beans, fisheries,flax and aid to beekeepers.
