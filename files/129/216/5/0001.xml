fSECRETTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(83) 5 COPY NO1 February 1983CABINETECONOMIC STRATEGYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerBACKGROUND1-     The background to our Fifth Budget, to be presented on 15 March,is one of expectations of modest growth in the world economy in1983, as the long-delayed recovery begins.    The need to maintainprudent fiscal and monetary policies, as the foundation for rebuildingsustainable growth, is fully recognised by most countries.2.     But there are two major uncertainties.    First, the scale and speedof recovery must depend on developments in the United States economy,and especially on whether the United States Administration canconvincingly tackle the problem of mounting federal deficits, and thuscreate both improved confidence and scope for further reductions ininterest rates.    Second, the future movement of oil prices is uncertain.A substantial reduction of approximately 7 per cent is already assumed Iin our forecasts, with effects broadly helpful to the level of worldeconomic activity and inflation, marginally unhelpful to the UnitedKingdom balance of payments and public revenue.    But we cannot rule outa considerably sharper fall.3-     In the United Kingdom we can this year expect growth of real demand,Perhaps at around 3 to 4 per cent in volume terms, compared to 2^ percent in 1982.    Competitiveness has continued to improve, but not enoughto prevent some of this &quot;leaking&quot; overseas.    Thus the forecast is forgrowth of output of only 2 per cent this year.     This is, however, abetter prospect than was foreseen in the Autumn Statement, and (for thesecond successive year) slightly above the average of the major industrialeconomies - growth in Japan may be a little faster, whereas in Europe itmay be rather slower.    Here, as abroad, unemployment is likely tocontinue to increase, at least for some time, but improved growth andbetter profitability should ensure that the rise is much slower than in1982.    Inflation, now at 5.4 per cent, is down to less than half therate of a year ago, with further improvements still to come, beforesterling&apos;s recent fall produces a slight upturn later in the year.Jnterest rates also dropped steeply over the year, from 16 per cent inautumn 1981 to 9 per cent last autumn, 11 per cent now.Annex 1 sets out some of the key figures.    The 1983 column, beingbased on early forecasts, is of course subject to a number ofuncertainties.    There will be a further forecast at Budget time.1. SECRET I
SECRETTHE STRATEGY5. Against this background the basic aims of the Budget must be:(a) to avoid setting at risk the gains on inflation andinterest rates which have resulted from past Budget restraint;(b) to sustain and advance the domestic recovery, preferablyby measures to encourage output, and so improve employmentopportunities; and(c) to provide the maximum tax reductions consistent with (a) ,and targetted with (b)  in mind.BORROWING6. In the 1982 Budget we envisaged a 1982/83 Public Sector BorrowingRequirement (PSBR) of 3$ per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), or 9.5 billion, and we currently expect to undershoot this figure. Fornext year,  the Medium Term Financial Strategy (MTFS) suggests that weshould aim for 2.75 per cent of GDP, or  8 billion.    The present forecast(which assumes - as is customary - that income tax thresholds and exciseduties are increased in line with inflation) suggests that this wouldpermit a rather higher &quot;fiscal adjustment&quot; - ie higher spending or lowertaxes - than the  1 billion indicated in the Autumn Statement.&apos;      As the difference between two very substantial figures (revenueand expenditure totals) the PSBR is of course particularly hard toforecast accurately.    This year&apos;s likely shortfall partly reflects thefact that the real oil price, and hence North Sea revenue, has notfallen as anticipated in 1982 Budget decisions.    But the odds are thatit will fall further.8.     In coming to a final view of the PSBR for 1983/84 for which weshould aim, I shall have to consider the trade-off between tax reliefand action which would help to bring interest rates down further. (TheInternational Monetary Fund team, in their preliminary report on theirrecent visit, drew attention to the need for continued restraint on thePSBR &quot;to ensure that its financing will not place undue upward pressure n interest rates.&quot;)    Equally, I have to consider the effect that anygiven PSBR, as well as any deviation from the figures we have alreadyPublished, might have on market perceptions, and on public opiniongenerally.    In particular, we need to avoid encouraging furthersterling depreciation, given its impact on inflation.    Sterling&apos;s recentfall makes relaxation of fiscal and monetary conditions less justifiableto the markets; and should reduce pressure for such relaxation, for itwill benefit industry, and hence putput and employment.My preliminary view is that it would be a mistake to publish aforecast 1983/84 PSBR above the  8 billion suggested in the MTFS and theAutumn Statement.2SECRET^^^^^^^ _zS^^M
SECRETFISCAL OPTIONS10. As noted above (paragraph 6), the current forecast suggests howeverthat, without risking the adverse market reactions which could follow anincrease in forecast borrowing, we could have more scope than the AutumnStatment suggested for tax reductions over and above revalorisation. Aslast year, the main issue is the balance to be struck between:i. measures which reduce income tax; andii. measures which would directly assist companies.11. We ought of course also to consider measures which would directlyaffect prices.    But I should be inclined to give these a rather lowerpriority.    Not to revalorise indirect taxes is expensive: Annex 2 showsthat it would cost over  0.5 billion, substantially using up our roomfor manoeuvre.    Moreover,  since inflation is low, the effect on prices f full revalorisation across the board is relatively small (less than0.5 per cent on the Retail Price Index).    It may be right to considerPartial exemptions for individual duties, but the general presumptionmust I think be to go for revalorisation.   Cuts in VAT would make littleeconomic or political sense.12. Annex 3 sets out some background on how personal and corporatetaxation have moved and Annex 4 shows the revenue effects of changes inthe main taxes.    Points to consider include the following:i. the case for increasing income tax thresholds over andabove Rooker/Wise is strong.    Our record on personal taxation(taking National Insurance contributions into account)  is notgood, as Annex 3 shows.    A significant increase in thresholdscould well bring benefits in wage bargaining, and would helpalleviate the poverty and unemployment traps;ii. the most obvious ways of giving direct help to industryare a further reduction in the National Insurance Surcharge (NIS) -which would follow the pattern of the last Budget - or a reductionin Corporation Tax - the only main tax rate which we have notreduced.    Clearly we want to help encourage improvements incompetitiveness and the rebuilding of companies&apos; profit margins.On the other hand, companies are already benefitting from thefurther percentage point cut in NIS, announced in the AutumnStatement, and from falls in both interest rates and the exchangerate.13. In some respects it is a mistake to distinguish too sharply the casefor particular forms of tax reduction.   When second round effects aretaken into account the medium-term consequences of different forms mayoften be strikingly similar (eg for unemployment, GDP and company income).But I would welcome colleagues&apos; views on the right balance between thetwo categories of possible general fiscal action.14. The Budget will also include, as last year, packages of smallermeasures targetted to help particular areas of industry or particularlydeserving groups.    I shall be in touch separately with individualcolleagues concerned.3SECRET^^^^^ _____- Li}
JTSECRETSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION15. The recovery we expected last year has been delayed (though lesshere than in many countries abroad), but we expect significant realgrowth this year (and more than in the Organisation for EconomicCo-operation and Development as a whole).    We should maintain policiesdesigned to combat inflation and improve competitiveness, and sopromote faster growth and hence employment, on a secure and sustainablebasis.16. This approach is not inconsistent with real tax reductions, asthe last Budget demonstrated.17. I would welcome colleagues&apos; views on all these matters on3 February.G HTreasury Chambers1 February 19834SECRET^^^^ 111
