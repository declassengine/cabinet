^ CONFIDENTIALTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTc(83) 2COPY NO  8 317 January 1983CABINETPARLIAMENTARY CONTROL OF EXPENDITURE (REFORM) BILLMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer|        Mr St John-Stevas has stated that the Bill will be published on  18 January,t will have its Second Reading on 28 January.;       Following Cabinet discussions on 16 December I have had further discussionsith Mr St John-Stevas.    On the main outstanding issue, of access by thecomptroller and Auditor General (C &amp; AG) to the nationalised industries&apos; books,there remains a wide gap between our position and his.3However I have given him a detailed critique of the appointment and statusclauses in his Bill, as suggested in my minute of 24 December to the Prime Minister, Iand some progress has been made on these clauses.    I have not seen the version to be IPublished;    but in discussion with me Mr St John-Stevas has accepted that theomptroller and Auditor General should be independent, and has promised to deleterom the Bill power for the Public Accounts Committee (PAC)  to direct the C &amp; AG,jjnd to provide for the C &amp; AG to be paid  (as at present)  from the Consolidated Fund.was reluctant to take out the provision making the C &amp; AG an officer of the^Use&gt; which he believes is attractive in principle for the supporters of the Bill.ls provision would not conclusively make the C &amp; AG subject to direction, but^ u^_leave some doubt about his independence.    We should therefore seek to amend, e Bill to remove the provision, or insert a clause which removes any doubt abouthe independence of the C &amp; AG.1&quot;       Mr St John-Stevas has told me that his Bill will provide for the advice to&lt;^Ueen on tne appointment of the C &amp; AG to be in the form of a Motion by these of Commons, moved by the Prime Minister after consultation with the Chairmanthe PAC.    This appears to reverse the roles of the Prime Minister and thec ai5man of the PAC, compared with the earlier draft of the Bill:    we shall need tosider whether it goes far enough, and in the right form, to meet our case. (Ifdoes, it is likely to be unwelcome to some of his principal supporters.) &apos;^      011 the range of the C &amp; AG&apos;s duties, the Bill is still likely to provide forpUk^  have access to the nationalised industries, public corporations and allp     .c and private sector bodies mainly supported by monies provided bylament, except that Local Authorities are specifically excluded.    The intentionen to ^e that major examinations of nationalised industries, publiction rat^ nS 3nC* ^overnment owned companies would take place only after consulta-t^e   Wlth the sponsoring Departments.    Mr St John-Stevas appears to accept thatp0^ . ^ AG! should not question the merits of Government policies or the strategic&apos;?he B^iS  ^ t*ie natl nal:&apos;-sed industries:   but once again we shall need to studyCONFIDENTIAL &quot; 20 &apos;
CONFIDENTIAL6. The Bill is now not likely to give the C &amp; AG right of access to the Hjthousands of companies and other bodies which would have been caught by thePAC&apos;s recommendation to give the C &amp; AG access to all bodies in receipt of voted ?money, however little.    But on the nationalised industries, which he rightly sees ?as the central issue, Mr St John-Stevas has not been willing to make any further ?concessions.    And he has of course not moved nearly far enough to meet our concerns ?SECOND READING DEBATE7- Cabinet decided on 16 December that we should not oppose the Billon SecondReading.    I suggest that in the debate we sh6uld concentrate our criticism of theBill on the nationalised industry issue, on which we have arguments that many ofour backbenchers ought to find persuasive.    In the time before the debate weshould make every effort to make these arguments known, and to ensure the fullest |possible support for our views on the debate.    On the status issues we_shou d be ?able to acknowledge that the Bill is broadly acceptable providing the independence ? f the C &amp; AG can be clarified.COMMITTEE STAGE8- We should consider how to handle the Committee stage after Second fadingwhen we have a better measure of the support for the Bill.    It is likely that theBill will suffer from many technical faults.    In preparation officials should be |asked to draft amendments to remove the technical faults  in the status and appoint*ent clauses, and to implement the Government&apos;s views on the clauses dealing withthe- C &amp; AG&apos;s access.    They should also prepare detailed notes on the technicalfaults in those clauses.FURTHER DISCUSSION WITH MR ST JOHN-STEVAS9- There is little scope for further negotiation with Mr St John-Stevas beforeSecond Reading, but we should review the position after the debate.CONCLUSION10- I seek colleagues&apos; agreement to the handling of the Bill on the linesProposed above.G HTreasury Chambers17 January 1983CONFIDENTIAL 21
