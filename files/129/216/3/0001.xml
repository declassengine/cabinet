V v CONFIDENTIALTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(83)  3 COPY NO       fi Q18 January 1983CABINETINTERIM PAYMENTS FOR CIVIL LEGAL AID WORKMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department1. At their meeting on 16 December, the Cabinet invited me to arrange forthe Home and Social Affairs Committee (H)  to consider further the SolicitorGeneral&apos;s proposals for an interim scheme to reduce the arrears of paymentsowed to barristers and solicitors under the civil legal aid scheme. TheCabinet thought that about  20 million might be made available for an interimscheme in 1982-83, provided that it was linked to a review of the costs andfees in civil legal aid cases,  and to progress towards improved control ofcosts  (CC(82)  53rd Conclusions, Minute 5).2. H Committee have now reached agreement on revised proposals put forwardby the Solicitor General, under which about  30 million would be madeavailable in 1982-83 to meet some 10 per cent of the outstanding fees forcivil legal aid work.     20 million of this total would represent a netaddition to public expenditure in the current year,  and the remaining 10 million would be financed from the Lord Chancellor&apos;s existing allocationfor 1982-83.3. Only claims made before 18 February 1983 for work done under civil legalaid certificates issued on or before 31 March 1981 will be considered underthe interim scheme.    Barristers will be able to claim 30 per cent of out-standing fees, while solicitors will be eligible for flat rate pay paymentsof  150 for each county court or matrimonial case, and  300 for each HighCourt case.    Adjustments will be made as necessary once the final bills havebeen assessed or taxed.4. Progress towards a more permanent scheme will depend on the achievementof improved control over civil legal aid costs.    To this end, officials havebeen instructed to undertake an urgent examination of the reasonableness ofpayments to lawyers in legal aid cases, while the Lord Chancellor has agreedto press ahead as quickly as possible with his consultations with the judiciary Iand the profession on improvements in civil litigation procedures. TheSolicitor General will, subject to the Lord Chancellor&apos;s overall respon-sibility for the legal aid system, take personal charge of negotiations withthe profession on a number of issues,  including greater standardisation inpayments in civil cases, transfer of the responsibility for fixing fees incivil cases from the Rule Committees to the Lord Chancellor, improvedprocedures in matrimonial cases, and a review of the Green Form scheme. TheSolicitor General will report back to H Committee no later than July 1983 onthe outcome of these negotiations.CONFIDENTIALi -99-1
CONFIDENTIAL5. H Committee agreed in principle that arrangements similar to those iproposed by the Solicitor General for England and Wales might be introducedin Scotland,  subject to agreement on a satisfactory scheme being reached withthe Chief Secretary, Treasury.6. Subject to the approval of the Cabinet,  the Solicitor General willannounce the interim scheme by means of an early reply to an arrangedParliamentary Question.    This will be a low-key announcement, which, whileacknowledging the need for a supplementary estimate in due course, will notrefer in terms to the additional expenditure of  30 million in 1982-83.7. The Committee concluded that the Solicitor General&apos;s revised proposalsdischarged the remit given by the Cabinet on 16 December, and I now invitecolleagues :a. to endorse the proposed interim scheme and the associated consul-tation with the profession; andb. to agree to an early announcement on the lines proposed inparagraph 6 above.W WHome Office18 January 19832CONFIDENTIAL I^^^^ 23 m
