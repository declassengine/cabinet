THIS DOCUMENT IS THE   PROPERTY   OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT1 :. Printed fv the Cabinet.  July 1951  - &apos;r&apos;i^    * confidential  / &quot;      - &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;:, &apos;\&apos; &quot;y&apos;  &apos; Copy No.    3CP. (51) 1893rd July, 1951CABINETMAN-POWER FOR THE MINESMemorandum by the Minister of Fuel and PowerSince January the miners have made a splendid effort, arid output in the first24 weeks of the year was 3-76 million tons above 1950.Opencast has been adversely affected by excessive rainfall and other factors.In the first 24 weeks, the output was just over 1 million less than in 1950.Consumption has risen in an alarming way. During the first three months to31st March, while our economy campaign was producing results, the increase was-1 percent, above 1950, i.e., at an annual rate of 6 million tons. But at the endof 24 weeks of 1951, the increase in consumption has been 4 - 2 per cent., i.e., at anannual rate of over 8 million tons.2.  Thus, the figures for the first 24 weeks of 1951 are as follows:  First 24 weeks Increase.......                                                       of 1951 over 1950(Fig. in million tons) million total output  (deep-mined andopencast)             ...      ....      104-370 -1-2-74Total inland consumption       ...         101-014 +4-083. These figures make it plain that the increase of output is not keeping pace with the increase of consumption. . Even allowing for the bad weather which wehave had since January, it is plain that with rising industrial. demand our coal situation is precarious. . ,4.  There are only three ways in which deep-mined output can be increased:(a) by improved morale among the management and the miners;(b) by increased investment in machinery and reorganisation;(c) by increased man-power.5. Morale of the Coal Industry. There is no doubt that the morale of theindustry has been very good in the last few months. Moreover, progress is beingmade by the National Coal Board (N.C.B.), in consultation with the Ministry ofLabour, in the field of personal management. If, on the basis of the Cabinefsdecisions, the N.C.B. can now agree on a supplementary pensions scheme, I think this will be a most important factor in keeping morale good throughout theremainder of the year.The miners now thoroughly understand the nation&apos;s need for coal, and I hopethat they will continue to respond as they have done hitherto.6. Investment in the Mines. It is agreed that investment in the mines shall beat the highest practicable level. The present shortage of steel will undoubtedly delay the deliveries of machinery to the pits, and this will probably remain true until thefull scheme for steel allocation is in force. I hope, however, that in the meantimeit may be possible for the Government, by administrative action, to help the N.C.B.as much as possible. I have discussed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinistry of supply how this can be done.&quot; &apos;40845
.....7:  Man-power for the Mines-Th&amp;rb remains man-power.The. measures upon&apos; Which the Cabinet decided&apos; during November, december and&apos;January last have been eminently; successful. Up till November, there had beena continuous net loss of man-power for nearly;two years; had this trend continued at the same rate, the present strength in the pits might have been between 670,000and 675,000. men.; The effect 6n output would have been disastrous.  ;As a result of the measures taken, hot only was the loss stopped, but theman-power was increased by 17,000 to the, total of 703,400 on 14th April.&apos;: 8.&apos; &quot;Since l4th;/April the increasein man-power has been checked and, as was expected, there has been a slight fall--1,500 over 9 weeks.The Minister of Labour and I have discussed the matter with the N.C.B.,and we are agreed that a continuance of measures previously initiated is now required to reduce wastage, and to stimulate the flow of new recruits into the mines.9.  Among these measures are (a) the. supplementary pensions scheme;(b) continued co-operation between the Employment Exchanges and the divisional, Area and Pit Authorities of the N.C.B.;(c) a general recruiting campaign;(d) the recruitment of Irish;(e) the recruitment of Italians;(/) the return of ex-miners from the Armed Forces;(g) improving the effectiveness of the administrative arrangements under whichminers are reserved from call-up for National Service;(h) more upgrading to the face;.:. (;) pressing on with, and if possible extending, schemes for the accommodation of miners transferred tp more productive pits.10. Supplementary Pensions. The Cabinet have made their decisions on a supplementary pensions scheme, and I hope that a scheme may be finally agreed between the N.C.B. and the National Union of Mineworkers (N.U.M.) within theearly future.11. Closer Co-operation between the Employment Exchanges and theN.C.B. The Minister of Labour and the N.C.B. have agreed on measures toimprove the liaison between the Labour Exchanges and the Divisional Area and PitAuthorities. I think substantial improvement will result from the action whichthe Minister of Labour has taken.12. Recruiting Campaign. The N.C-B., in co-operation with the Ministryof Labour,.will continue their general recruiting campaign. They are prepared to spend an additional  25,000 on advertising, provided the Government makes an equal contribution. I understand that the Minister of Labour will be making proposals for finding this contribution. Any help that, can be given to-day inMinisters&apos; speeches, emphasising the vital importance of the miners&apos; work, wouldbe of special value at the present time.13. Recruitment of, Irish. The recruitment of Irish for the N.C.B. has not,been a success. So far it has only been possible in Northern Ireland. About 200have come over; only 50 of them have stayed in the pits; the rest have gone very quickly to other industry. The N.C.B. are naturally reluctant to spend money on this recruitment with so little return. But, nevertheless, I think it may be worthwhile for them to persist. Moreover, it may be that they will now be able, withthe guidance of the Ministry of Labour, to extend recruitment to Southern Ireland.14.  Recruitment of Italians. The scheme for the recruitment of Italians tooksome time to start, but the N.C.B. have so far obtained firm commitments fromthe N.U.M:1 Lodges for the acceptance of 970 Italians in various parts of the.coal-fields: -&quot;       &apos;    -     - - -[ &quot;This has enabled the Ministry of Labour and the N.C.B. to increase the number .of arrivals from Italy from 30 to 60 per week.    ;This progress gives good hope that the present target of 1,500 Italians before ithe end of 1951 can be realised., But I propose to discuss increasing this programme with the leaders of theN.U!M. In my&apos; view, we can arid must considerably increase the. flow of workers from Italy. Our Labour Attache in Rome tells us that^ if we need them, he cansend us as many good Italians as the industry can take.     ;   . .
15. Upgrading -Iainasking:the.N.C.B.to seek, energetically, and in cp-opera-tion with the N.U.M., to increase the rate of upgrading jtb the face.&apos; &apos; :.16.   Housing. I am sure I can count on the continued .co-operation of, the.Minister of Local Government and Planning in helping to iget additional.houses tfor miners. Of course, housing is necessarily more of a long-term measure,..but jit:is an essential factor perhaps the -most-important single factor4-in keeping: up theman-power which we are certain to need in the pits over the:next.fe*w years.&apos; 17. Ex-Miners from the Forces. I proposed to the Cabihfcijast november that ex-miners who had volunteered on regular engagements in the Armed Forces,should be invited to return tattemight perhaps return. -:       ,&quot;.     -   &apos;-&apos;&quot; &apos; &apos;    V i        &apos;--:V:      &apos;&apos;The Cabinets decision on this matter was only made on 1st February, 1951(CM. (51) 11th Conclusions, Minute 3). After that decision, it tpok. some time before the necessary instructions were sent out to the various units in the armed forces. The first applications from ex-miners who wanted to come back to the pits were not received until April. By 15th June the total number of applicationsreceived was 2,629; over the last six weeks the numbers of applications have beenbetween 120 and 150 per week; and further applications are still coming in,. Itseems, therefore, reasonable to hope that the total applications will number atleast the 3,000 which I estimated, and perhaps more.-By 15th June, 1,203 ex-miners had actually been released from the forces and 943 had resumed work in the pits. If we get the full 3,000, their output overthe next year will be almost a million tons of additional coal, i.e., almost as muchas we imported from the United States. :   1 v18. Under the existing scheme, ex-miners may only apply, if they have donesix months&apos; work in the pits, and if they have volunteered Tor the regular Forceswithin the last two years. I.believe it might now be worth while to change thescheme in the following ways: (a) to reduce the period for which men must have served1 in the mines fromsix months to three months; - !        &quot;&apos;(b) to change the limitation that only ex-miners may be released who have joined the Forces within the last two years, and. to substitute threeyears instead of two.I have no means of knowing how many additional men these two changesmight bring in, but I think it quite likely that it would increase the number by oneto ,two thousand. If so, this would be as big a contribution to the manpower pro-blem as we hope to get from the Italians this year.19. I propose that a further effort should now be made to return to the pitsthe ex-miners who qualify under the existing scheme but who have not yet applied;and that, to this end, a fresh appeal should be made through the Service Depart-ments. I think it more than likely that such an appeal would bring a furtherresponse.20. In view of the very serious coal prospects, however, I venture to proposethat the existing scheme might now be further extended.21. I make this proposal because it is now clear that the need for a greateroutput of coal is becoming a major defence requirement, both for ourselves and forour European Allies. There is, indeed, no doubt that the European defence pro-gramme cannot be carried out unless coal output is largely increased. I suggest thatthe loss of these further men to the Armed Forces would be much more than out-weighed by the gain in this way to our defence strength.22. Reservation of Miners from call-up.-^-Man who work in coal mines arenot called up for National Service provided that they remain in the mines for solong as they are of military age. This, of course, is because work in mining is as important to national defence as service in the Forces. If, these facts were, broughtmore prominently than they are at present to the notice,of young men who registerfor Military Service, more of them might be induced, to join the mines.Again, many men of military age leave the mines-more, than 15,000 a year. .The Government White Paper (Cmd. 6831 , of 1946) announced that men bornbefore 1929 (who are now 22^ or over) would not be called up; those of the 15,000who are in this category therefore are not and cannot be called up. The rest of the15,000 are liable to call-up, within twenty-one days,.but some no doubt believe that
they will find other jobs exempting them from,military service; and not a few mightbe willing to go. back to the mines if, instead of being called up forthwith, they were told merely that they would be called up unless they resumed their work of vitalnational importance in the mines.. . Conclusions&apos;/23.  I therefore propose-(a) that everything that is compatible with present decisions should bedone to help the N.C.B. over supplies of steel for the pits and formachinery;(b) Ministers should give all the support they can to the recruiting carn^paign for the mines;(c) that we should increase the numbers of Italians recruited as much aswe can;(d) that everything possible should be done to accelerate the return to the pits of the ex-miners in the Forces who are eligible under thepresent scheme, and who desire to return to the pits, and that weshould address another appeal to those who have not so far offered;    to return to the pits, explaining to them again that their service as&apos;.,. miners is as important to the Nation as their service as combatants;(e) that we should extend the present scheme by reducing the qualifyinglimit of six months&apos; work to three months and to release ex-minerswho have volunteered within the last three years;(/) that we should instruct the Armed Services to exclude from call-upfor annual training miners who are Territorials or equivalentReservists;(g) that we should seek to make more effective the arrangements forreserving the coal miners from call-up as suggested in paragraph18 above; and(h) that the recruitment of Irish should be continued by the N.C.B.P.J.N.-B.Ministry of Fuel and Power,,S.W. 1,- ;   3rd July, 1951.
