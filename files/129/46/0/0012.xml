77THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY  OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet,  June 1951CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.    3 j[CP. (51) 16215th June, 1951CABINETROYAL COMMISSION ON MARRIAGE AND DIVORCEMemorandum by the Lord chancellor. When the proposed Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce was last considered by the Cabinet (CM. (51) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 5) it was agreedthat, when the discussion was resumed, my colleagues should have before them the terms of reference suggested for the Commission. I accordingly attach draftterms of reference which have been agreed between the Home Secretary, theSecretary of State for Scotland, the English and Scottish Law Officers and myself.2. The terms of reference have been drafted so as to ensure that theCommission will not be narrowly confined to the law of divorce but will be ableto consider any matters which, in the Commission^ view, are material for the promotion and maintenance of happy married life. I think a good deal ofimportance is attached by public opinion to the Commission^ being able to take these considerations into account.J.House of Lords, SWA,15th June, 1951.annex draft Terms of ReferenceTo enquire into the law of England and the law of Scotland concerningdivorce and other matrimonial causes and into the powers of courts of inferiorjurisdiction in matters affecting relations between husband and wife, and to considerwhether any changes should be made in the law or its administration, includingthe law relating to the property rights of husband and wife, both during marriage and after its termination (except by death), and what steps should be taken witha view to promoting and maintaining healthy and happy married life and safe-guarding the interests and well-being of children; and to consider whether any alteration should be made in the law prohibiting marriage with certain relationsby kindred or affinity.40742
