jHlS-DOCUMENT-IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY ^GOVERNMENT)confidential cp. (51) 186 COPY NO.2ND JULY, 1951CABINET31REORGANISATION OF GERMAN HEAVY industry memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Allied High Commission in Germany will soon take acrucial decision about those coal companies (known as the Schedule Ccompanies) which may under certain conditions be included inreorganisation under Law 27 (for the reorganisation of the German coal,iron and steel industries).   The American and French consider thatthese companies need not be included in the reorganisation if they optout, and the United Kingdom element in the High Commission, whodisagree with this view, have asked for instructions as to the line theyshould take.2. The companies affected by Law 27 fall into three main classes.There are first the Companies which unquestionably representexcessive concentration of economic power, and which are to becompulsorily liquidated and deconcentrated;  these are the Schedule Acompanies.   The second class consists of-42 firms (the Schedule Ccompanies) which are to be included in reorganisation only if certain conditions are fulfilled.   The two conditions of immediate concerncover cases where:(i)  The owners consent to inclusion in a reorganisation plan, or(ii)  The Allied High Commission determines that their inclusion&quot;is essential to accomplish the purposes of this law&quot;.There is also a third class, dealt with in the Annex, coveringfirms which are to be treated, in the same way as the Schedule Aconcerns if investigation proves that they are excessive concentrations;if not, they are to be treated in the same way as Schedule C concerns.3. The present problem has arisen because the German body(Deutsche Kohlenbergbauleitung, or DKBL) which is responsible,under Allied supervision, for the production of a reorganisation plan for the coal industry, included a number of Schedule C concerns in theplan which it drew up in September 1950,   These concerns were askedas a first step whether they consented to inclusion; their replies,which were received by May, 1951, shewed that only five of them consentedunconditionally.   This immediately produced disagreement within theHigh Commission;  the American and French proposed to obtain theFederal Government^ views as to the treatment which should be givento the companies which did not assent to inclusion, at the same timemaking it clear that they were in favour of decontrolling and excludingfrom reorganisation at least some of them.   The United Kingdom elementagreed to the proposed reference to the Federal Government, partly to avoid a snap decision on decontrol, and partly because there was atleast a chance that the Federal Government, under Trade Union pressure,
might agree with our views.   The Federal Governmenfs reply howevermade it clear that they did not approve of the inclusion of Schedule Ccompanies in reorganisation against their will, and the Americans andFrench immediately proposed that all Schedule C concerns whichdeclined inclusion in reorganisation or agreed to it conditionallyshould be excluded from reorganisation and, therefore, decontrolled.4. The crux of the disagreement between ourselves and the americans and French on this issue lies in differences of outlook as to the funda-mental objective of Law 27.   We have always regarded this law notonly as an exercise in deconcentration but also as a means ofreorganising the German coal and steel industries on sound technical and economic lines, leaving it to the Germans to decide beforereorganisation was completed whether it shall be privately orpublicly owned.   The Americans and French, on the other hand, have regarded it mainly as an instrument for breaking down certainconcentrations of economic power which were objectionable on political as well as economic grounds, and have worked on the assumption thatthe new smaller units established under the law would be privatelyoperated.   They consider that as the Schedule C companies are not in themselves excessive concentrations of economic power, no action underLaw 27 need be ta^en regarding them.   A further consideration, though notofficially stated, is doubtless that the more iron and steel concerns aredecontrolled and thereby handed over to private ownership, the moredifficult it will be for the present or any future German Government to nationalise either industry.5. The United Kingdom position may be briefly summarised asfollows:  in the first place, the exclusion of the Schedule C companies will seriously reduce the scope of the reorganisation of the German coalindustry.   The coal plan would in effect become a reorganisation of the colliery assets of the Schedule A concerns, representing some60% of the whole industry.   Secondly, the existing DK3L plan, which includes the Schedule C companies, was drawn up by an expertGerman body representing both coal management and the Trade unions and is a comprehensive scheme, paying regard to technical, geographicaland economic considerations.   This expert body moreover explicitlyurged that the plan should be accepted in its entirety, and the irrecommendation should take precedence over the inevitably self-interested motives of individual mine-owners who wish to opt out of reorganisation.   Thirdly, there is the fact that the German Trade unions have always insisted on the necessity of a comprehensive reorganisation of the coal industry and the inclusion of the Schedule C companies.6. Sound as the United Kingdom arguments are, they cannot be pressed too far.   The reason is that at the time when Law 27 was approved,the American High Commissioner accepted the wording of the clauserelating to the conditions (see paragraph 2) on which Schedule Ccompanies could be included in reorganisation only on an under-standing with the United Kingdom High Commissioner which was placedon record in the following terms:-&quot;It is not our intention that the expression&apos;to accomplishthe purposes of this Law&apos; should be used as a justification for vague arguments pressing for the inclusion of an enterprise on the grounds that its inclusion is necessary forthe economy of Germany.   Cur intention is to provide for theinclusion of mines where some good reason can be produced ofa practical nature showing that if they are left out, anomalieswill arise in the reorganisation carried out under the Lawor that without such inclusion the effective operation of one ormore of fhe new unit?; would be seriously prejudiced.11
&apos;    1927. In my opinion, this understanding gravely weakens the argu-ments, admirable as they are in themselves, which can be put forward in favour of compulsory inclusion of Schedule C companies in reorganisation.We are not arguing that the exclusion of these companies will lead toanomalies in reorganisation or will prejudice the operation of the newunit companies; in fact, our technical experts in Germany admit thatit would be difficult to prove it except in a very few cases, and the acting High Commissioner, with whom this question was discussed on28th June, believes that the Americans and French will not be slow to point this out.8. In these circumstances three possible &quot;courses of action aretheoretically open to us.   In the first place, we might accept the factthat we are certain to be outvoted by the Americans and French atsome stage and might agree to the proposed exclusion of Schedule Ccompanies from reorganisation.   I consider that in view of the intrinsicmerits of the arguments indicated in paragraph 5 above it would not be proper for us to abandon so lightly our desire that Schedule C companies should be included in reorganisation;  we should certainly be heavilycriticised by the German Trade Unions if we were to do so.  A secondpossible course would be to insist that this matter be discussed and put to the vote at the Council of the Allied High Commission and if(as is almost certain) we are outvoted, to appeal to Governments.   Itwould however be very difficult to argue that an appeal can be made in this case.   An appeal to Governments from a majority decision of theHigh Commission can only lie if the outvoted party considers thatan intergovernmental agreement has been infringed by the decision in question.   It cannot in this case be contended that the existence ofLaw 27 itself constitutes an intergovernmental agreement.   The position was different when we appealed to Governments on the question of theinterpretation of the preamble to Law No. 27, because this disputedprovision had in fact been subject to intergovernmental discussion.Moreover, if we were to appeal to Governments the Americans at leastwould undoubtedly quote against us the understanding between theUnited States and the United -kingdom High Commissioners recorded in paragraph 3 above, which, they might argue, is tantamount to an inter-governmental agreement and which is generally adverse to the lines of ourpresent argument.   The third and remaining course is to insist thatthis matter should be discussed and put to the vote at the Council ofthe Allied High Commission but to accept the majority decision, at thesame time insisting that our disagreement should be formally placedon record and reserving the right to indicate publicly our disagreement with this step in the event of criticism in Germany or elsewhere.9. In these circumstances, I recommend to my colleagues that theUnited Kingdom High Commissioner should insist that this matter bediscussed at the Council, that he should argue against the United States/^French proposal to exclude Schedule C concerns from reorganisationalong the lines indicated in paragraph 5, but that he should accept amajority decision provided that:-va) the United Kingdom position is duly recorded in a statementattached to the minutes of the Council meeting, and(b) that he reserves the right to indicate disagreement with thisdecision if it should be criticised in Germany or elsewhere.If this is agreed to, I shall consider whether it might be possibleto prompt a suitable Parliamentary Question, the reply to which would make clear our attitude to this question.H.

annex the Schedule E ConcernsAt the time when Law 27 was worlsd out, there was a con-siderable difference of view between the Americans on the one side andthe French and ourselves on the other about the treatment of 3 concernswhich, under the previous Anglo/American Law /Law 75), were placedin Schedule A as excessive concentrations of economic power which were due to be compulsorily liquidated and deconcentrated.   These firms wereStinnes, Thyssen-Sornemisza and Ilseder Hutte.   The Americans thenargued that as these concerns were not excessive concentrations, they shouldshould be taken out of Schedule A and placed in Schedule C, for inclusion in reorganisation only if certain conditions were fulfilled.   In the caseof Stinnes, which was included in the original Law at American insistence,their real motive was pressure from the American financial interests involved, and the other two firms were probably added in order tomake the change of front in the case of Stinnes less obvious.   We and theFrench felt that nothing had happened since these 3 firms were includedin the original Schedule A to Law 75 which virtually committed us to theview that they were excessive concentrations of economic power.   Thismatter was considered at a Cabinet meeting held on 30th March, 1/50,see CP, (50) 43 and C. M. (50) 16th Concluions, Minute 2), when it wasdecided that we should insist on the retention of the 3 firms on the list ofunderta.dngs scheduled for liquidation.   It was, however, ultimately agreedthat all three concerns should be further investigated:  if thisinvestigation proved that&apos;they were excessive concentrations, they shouldbe treated as Schedule A concerns, if not, as Schedule C concerns.The Economics Committee of the Allied High Commission inFebruary, 1950, reached the conclusion that the last two concernsshould properly be treated as Schedule C companies, but made no finaldecision pending the examination of the self-deconcentration plansubmitted by Stinnes.   This examination is not yet complete.These concerns may be affected indirectly by the French/american proposals in this case.   If it should be finally decided to treat all threeas Schedule C concerns, and if, as is very probable, all three shoulddecline voluntarily to be included in reorganisation (except in thepossible case of Stinnes, on the basis of a voluntary self-deconcentration),it would follow that these concerns would be excluded from reorganisation and decontrolled. As the disposition of these companies is, however,being discussed in a separate context, it is suggested that we should confine ourselves, when recording our position on the C companies,to stipulating that we regard the Schedule E as in no way prejudiced byany decision on Schedule C companies.
