id. ( lf-*)31DOCUMENT- IS THE PROPERTY OF-HIS-britannic MAJEST-Y&apos;-S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(51) 1557TH JUNE, 1951COPY NO.   ijCABINETJAPANESE PEACE TREATY:   TALKS WITH MR. DULLESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs.    Limitations on Japan&apos;s right to re^arm.On 29th May (C.M,(51) 38th Conclusions&apos;, Minute 2) the Cabinetreaffirmed their view that Japan should be allowed a measure of rearmamentsubject to the limitations discussed at their meeting on 2nd January.    they considered, however, that in my forthcoming discussions with Mr. Dulles, Ishould make every effort to secure agreement that these limitations on japan&apos;s right to rearm should be specified in the Peace Treaty.    If this effort failed, and reliance had to be placed on a separate bilateral DefencePact between the United States and Japan, Mr. Dulles should at least be urged to agree that the Peace Treaty should not include any provision on thelines of Article 6(b) of the draft annexed to C.P.(51) 137, recognising Japan&apos;ssovereign right to rearm.2. Views of Mr. Dulles.    When these views were put to him, Mr. Dullesadmitted that perhaps the United States Government should have done more tokeep His Majesty&apos;s Government and other interested Governments informedregarding their proposed Defence Agreement with Japan.    This in fact wouldprovide that, for many years to come, specific Japanese air and naval basesshould be occupied by United States forces, in such a way that, apart from allother considerations, there was no possibility of Japan resuming heraggressive course for as long as this occupation lasted.    The United StatesGovernment were convinced that this was so, and were sure that the otherGovernments concerned would feel that no limitation on Japan&apos;s right torearm would be required in the Treaty once this information was available tothem.    In any event the United States Government saw objection to theinclusion of provisions limiting rearmament in a Treaty, first because of theeffect this would have upon the Japanese, and secondly because the experienceof the Versailles Treaty has shown that such provisions tend to be evaded bythe defeated Power.In these circumstances Mr. Dulles has supplied us with a copy ofthe memorandum (Annex A) which he hopes may give His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment useful material on this question.    A relevant extract from the speech which he proposes to make at the English Speaking Union tonight is also attached (Annex B),3. As regards Article 6(b) of the draft Treaty, it was made clear in discussion that, apart from providing a peg on which to hang the separateUnited States Defence Agreement, this had the following effect:   underArticle 6(a), which had been put in originally to meet the anxieties felt by australia and other countries, Japan accepted the obligations of Article 2of the United Nations Charter (peaceful settlement of international disputes,
refrain from use of force, co-operation with the United Nations); this,however, by itself had the effect of imposing obligations on Japan such as she would have had had she become a member of the United Nations withoutrecognising that she had the corresponding right of self-defence also referred to in the Charter.    Article 6(b) may, therefore, be regarded ascorrecting an anomalous position which, apart from the political aspect,would be open to objections under international law if Article 6(a) stoodalone, particularly having regard to the provisions of Article 107 of theUnited Nations Charter.    From this point of view the United States Govern&quot;ment attach importance to the inclusion of Article 6(b), although, in thehope of to some extent meeting any criticisms which might be applied to It,they would be prepared to omit the last few words of the Article.    These arethe words in square brackets in the text of the Article which is given in annex C.Recommendations.As regards the omission of any clause limiting Japan&apos;s right torearm, in view of the explanation given by Mr, Dulles it is recommended that this should not be pursued further.In view of the legal argument referred to above, it is recommendedthat we should agree to the retention of Article 6(b), amended asreferred to above by the United States Government in an attemptto meet our view.That we should, however, ask the United States Government to makea statement regarding the reassuring effects of their defence agreement with Japan, to be issued not later than the publicationof the text of the Peace Treaty, but if possible before that, andthe sooner the better.II.    Chinese participation.5. On 29th May (C.M.(51) 38th Conclusions, Minute 2) the cabinet agreed that the proposals contained in paragraphs 19 and 20 (C.P.(51) 137),recommending the participation of neither Chinese Government in the Treatybut the inclusion of an accession clause providing for Chinese accession in subsequent agreed circumstances, should be explored in the tails withMr. Dulles.6. Views of Mr. Dulles.    On being informed of our case, Mr. Dullessaid that he recognised our difficulties in the matter, the importance ofcarrying other countries, particularly Asiatic ones, with us on the issue, andalso the importance of not prejudicing in advance Japan&apos;s relations with China.He emphasised, however, that an important part of congressional opinion inthe United States would not agree to the omission of the Nationalists from thePeace Settlement, and this might lead to a serious danger of non-ratification of the Treaty by the Senate.    He had not yet been able to explore senatorialopinion regarding our compromise proposal, and he did not wish to take afinal stand against it at this stage.    He had, however, been trying out certainalternative possibilities, on which he would be grateful for our views.    these were:-(a)    An invitation to both the Communists and the Nationalists to sign the Treaty in respect of the areas which they respectivelycontrol;(a)(b)(c)
(b) the Treaty to take the form of a series of bilateral pacts, with japan free to sign such a pact with either China;(c) the Treaty to be a multilateral pact, as now proposed, to be signed by neither Government of China, but with no accession clause orreference to the latter in the Treaty, and the Treaty to be. accompanied by an agreed announcement explaining that, giventhe disagreement among the principal parties on the Governmententitled to represent China, neither Government of China had signed.    The effect of this would be that the problem would beleft for Japan herself to solve, once she had resumed her independence on the conclusion of the Peace Treaty;  she wouldthen be able to negotiate a similar or appropriate Treaty with either Government of China.    There should, however, be a pro-vision in the multilateral Peace Treaty to the effect that japan would subsequently not conclude a more favourable Treaty withany other Power unless she also extended the special advantagesthereby obtained by that Power to the signatories of the originalTreaty.7. Mr. Dulles1 proposal (a) is undesirable from our point of view sinceany invitation would be accepted by the Nationalists and almost certainlyrejected by the Communists, so that this would in effect simply be a fairlytransparent device for bringing the Nationalists in and keeping the Communistsout.    As regards (b), His Majesty&apos;s Government have never favoured thepeace settlement taking the form of a series of identical bilateral pacts;this is untidy from a legal point of view, difficult to work out in practice(e.g. why should a bilateral Peace Treaty between Japan and Peru go intodetails about the Ryukyu and Bonin islands?), and also it opens the door towhat we wish to avoid, namely the participation of the Nationalists in the samepeace settlement with ourselves, the only difference being that they would signa separate document rather than the same one.Proposal (c) has the same basic principle as our own compromise proposal, namely, that neither Government of China should sign the Treaty;the point of difference is that, instead of the suspensory conception figuringin the text of the Treaty, it would be put into an agreed statement outside theTreaty though simultaneous with it.     Like our own proposal, it has the meritof leaving the responsibility for their future relations with China on theshoulders of the Japanese themselves, so that it would thus eliminate one ofthe major difficulties to any other form of solution.    Even under our ownproposal about the accession clause, Japan would in fact be free, once thegeneral treaty came into effect, to conclude a separate bilateral Peace treaty with either Government of China without waiting for the general agreementproposed in our accession clause.    The practical effect of both solutionswould thus be very much the same, and in substance the proposal represents a considerable step by the United States Government to meet our point ofview.8. Recommendations.     That we should continue to press for ourcompromise proposal, but that if necessary we should be prepared to acceptMr. Dulles&apos; very similar proposal at (c) above.III.   Formosa.9. At their meeting on 29th May (C.M.(51) 38th Conclusions, Minute 2)the Cabinet agreed that, in the discussion with Mr. Dulles, the question of formosa should if possible be included in the manner proposed in paragraph21 of C.P.(51) 137:  namely, that if neither Government of China participates,
the Treaty could provide for the cession of Formosa to &apos;China&quot;, with asuspensory provision which reserved the position of the signatories on theinterpretation of this clause.10. Views of Mr. Dulles.    In discussion Mr. Dulles maintained theUnited States view that the Treaty should provide simply for renunciation by japan of her sovereignty over Formosa, with no provision regarding itscession.    Indeed he now wished to propose that the territorial clauses of theTreaty should not provide, either, for the cession of South Sakhalin and theXuriles to Russia, but that there should be a single article providing on a uniform basis for renunciation by Japan of her sovereignty over SouthSakhalin and the Kuriles as well as over Formosa.     As regards SouthSakhalin and the Kuriles, this proposal has certain advantages from thepoint of view of all the major parties, including Russia, as will be seen from paragraph 14 below).    Mr. Dulles said that he did not think the UnitedStates Government could agree to our formula.    He emphasised that theinterest of the seven million Formosans should be considered.   Eventssince the Cairo Declaration made it likely that their best interest would not now be served by the transfer of Formosa to the highly centralised admini-stration of the Peking Government.    He felt that our formula would tend topre-judge the future of the Formosans, and would male the settlement of thequestion by the United Nations more difficult.    He thought the Treaty should leave the status of Formosa unchanged apart from removing Japanese rightsand sovereignty.11. We have never liked the United States proposal for a simplerenunciation by Japan, since legally it has the effect of turning Formosainto a &quot;no man&apos;s&quot; land.    In addition the Indian Government have told us that, unless the Treaty provides for the cession of Formosa to China, theywould not be prepared to sign it.    The similar stand taken by the indian government over the Ryukyu and Bonin Islands (see paragraph 18) suggests,however, that they may find other such points to criticise and reject even ifwe meet them over Formosa.    The United States Government are veryfirm in their opposition to this solution, and their case is certainly strength-thened by their new proposal about South Sakhalin and the Kuriles, in viewof vJiich a similar treatment of the Formosa point of view in the Treaty wouldhave the extra merit of consistency.12. Recommendation.     As the United States appear disposed to meetthe substance of our views over Chinese participation, it is suggested thatwe should try to meet them over Formosa since this does not involve anysacrifice of principle.    It is recommended that such a result should beachieved by laying down in the Treaty that Japan renounces her sovereignty over Formosa.    The matter would then be made the subject of an agreedannouncement outside the Treaty, linking up with the proposed announcement about Chinese participation (paragraph 6(c) above) and making the point thatthe future of Formosa is left open for eventual settlement by the united nations.    This would in fact have the result which we sought to achieve by our formula, and which the United States also wish to achieve, namelyleaving the Formosa problem over for settlement at a later date in circum-stances of more general agreement.IV.  The Kuriles and South Sakhalin.13. Views of Mr. Dulles.   The agreed preliminary draft of the Treatyprovided (Article 4) for Japan to cede the Kurile Islands and South Sakhalinto Russia.    There was, however, a clause in the Treaty (Article 25) under
which no state which did not sign the Treaty could receive any benefits under it, i. e. this concession would not take effect unless Russia signed;failing which the territories would, though occupied by Russia, be legallystill under 3&apos;apanese sovereignty.    Mr. Dulles has now raised a new pointin proposing that Japan should simply be required to renounce hersovereignty over these territories.    He explained that on reflection theUnited States Government prefer this solution, since in the Treaty as atpresent drafted, assuming Russia did not sign, she would be in a possessionof those territories, while their sovereignty would still legally be Japanese,a situation which might involve the United States, with her Defence Agreementwith Japan, in undesirable complications.14. Apart from the point made by Mr. Dulles, which seems to have much force, the new proposal seems to have positive advantages:  it wouldhave the effect that, whether or not Russia signs the Treaty, Japan stillrenounces her sovereignty over these territories.    Russia would thus infact get more out of it than under the Treaty as at present drafted, assumingshe did not sign in either case.    At least the link between these territories and Japan would now be legally severed.    We should thus be able to answerRussian criticism by saying that, although through no fault of ours sherefused to participate, we at any rate had done the most we could to look after her interest by getting Japan to renounce sovereignty over the terri-tories promised to her at Yalta.15. Recommendation.    That we can accept Mr. Dulles&apos; proposal onthis point.V.    The Ryukyu, Bonin and other Islands.16. On 29th May (C.M.(51) 38th Conclusions, Minute 2) the cabinet decided that I should attempt to ensure that the Treaty provided for arenunciation of Japanese sovereignty over these islands.17. Views of Mr. Dulles.     Mr. Dulles explained that in view of the closeconnections in economic, monetary and fishing matters between the Japanesemainland and at any rate the more northerly of the islands in question, theUnited States Government consider that it would be undesirable to put them under a different sovereignty^    In addition, the United States Government wasnot ready to face the implications of sovereignty over these islands beingvested in the United States.    This would involve the United States Governmentin financial commitments which would not arise if the territories were not under United States sovereignty.    In addition there would be difficulties about the legal and constitutional processes for the divesting of United Statessovereignty should that even appear desirable.    All in all, the United StatesGovernment prefer not to require Japan to renounce her sovereignty over the islands.-18. The Indian Government are strongly in agreement with the UnitedStates Government on the point that sovereignty over the Ryukyu and BoninIslands should be left to Japan, and the proposal for United Nations trustee-ship over the islands is unacceptable to India.    They feel so strongly over this that, unless their view is met, they have told us that they would not beprepared to sign the proposed Treaty.19. Recommendation.    Having regard to the explanation given byMr. Dulles, and to the fact that this is primarily an American problem, inwhich as it happens the Asian countries are likely to adopt the Americanview, it is suggested that we also should now accept it.
VI. Shipbuilding capacity.2.0. On 29th May ;C.M.(51) 38th Conclusions, Minute 2) the cabinet agreed that I should ascertain how the United States Government proposedto arrange for a voluntary acceptance by the Japanese of restrictions onthe use of their shipbuilding capacity, and that I should submit a further report to the Cabinet before the details of such an arrangement were finally settled with the United States Government.21. Mr. Dulles explained that after the present talks his principal assistant, Mr. Allison, is going to Tokyo to investigate on the spot how far the consideration of this question has gone.    We will be informed of theresult of Mr. Allison*s investigation.22. Re commendation.    That we should await further information fromthe United States Government before considering the matter further.VII. Gold.23. This is an item on which agreement has not yet been reached.I propose to raise it orally.H.M.Foreign Office, S.W.1,7TH JUNE, 1951.
ANNEX a security:   MEMORANDUM COMMUNICATED 3Y MR. DULLES1. During the entire period during which we have been working onthe provisions of a Japanese Peace Treaty the question of the security ofthe Pacific area has been a subject of major concern to the United States.This concern has not been limited solely to aggression on the part of anon-Pacific power but has included the possibility of aggressive action onthe part of Japan itself.The basis of United States thought on security is embodied in five measures as follows:-(a) A non-punitive, non-restrictive and &apos;liberal&quot; peace Treaty with japan, designed to encourage her to remain aligned with, and co-operativewith, the free nations of the world.(b) A United States-Japan Bilateral Security Pact, to be signedconcurrently with the Peace Treaty, which will assure the continuedpresence in Japan of United States forces for an indefinite period.(c) The United States maintains armed forces in the Ryukyus,particularly in Okinawa, and, as the President has stated publicly, expects to continue to maintain them there.(d) A tri-partite security pact among the United States, Australia andNew Zealand providing for co-operative action in the event of armed attack from any source against any of the signatories or its possessions or armed forces in the Pacific area.(e) An existing United States-Philippines Base Agreement which provides for the presence in the Philippines of United States armed forces.2. The possibility of aggressive action by Japan, therefore, must be viewed in the light of all five of these facts.    The Treaty of Peace offerswhat we believe to be the best hope of continuing the development of apeacefully inclined, non-revengeful Japan prepared to work in harmony with other freedom loving peoples and willing to reject the temptationswhich could be offered by the Soviet bloc were the Peace Treaty to containrestrictions not applicable to other sovereign states.3. The United State s - Japan Bilateral Security Pact will permit theretention in Japan of as large an armed force as the United States considers necessary.    The mere presence of these forces under the broad rights and powers which are to be granted them together with the relationships contem-plated will, as a practical matter, make impossible any aggressive actionon Japan&apos;s part or even preparation for such action.    The denial by terri-torial clauses in the Peace Treaty of Japan&apos;s control of essential rawmaterials plus the controls currently exercised by the United States and itsassociates on such materials as a result of the Free World&apos;s rearmamenteffort will make it impossible for Japan to acquire the means for large scale rearmament except with our knowledge and approval.4. The tripartite Security Pact will assure co-operative action on thepart of the United States, Australia and New Zealand in the event Japanattacks any one of those three nations in the Pacific, and will assure con-sultation together if there is any threat of such attack.    At the same time
the presence of United States forces in the Philippines under the existingBase Agreement and in Okinawa provides practical security againstaggressive action by Japan.We should be able at a later date to furnish all signatories to theJapanese Peace Treaty an authoritative and more definitive statement onthis important question of security than is possible at a time when theprovisions of these arrangements are not yet finalized in all respects.-ANNEXBEXTRACT FROM PROPOSED SPEECH BYMR. JOHN FOSTER DULLESOne of the dangers is, of course, that the peace might leave Japana vacuum of power into which aggressive power would move, or that Japan,ostensibly for defence, might rearm to a degree that might be againdangerous to us.    The United States, and indeed the Allied Powersgenerally, are determined that neither of these things shall happen, and Iam glad to say the Japanese are in full accord.    They want security, butthey want it without militarism.    So, the Japanese Government has invited the United States to enter into a security arrangement with it so that uponthe coming into force of the treaty of peace, Japan will not be a vacuum of power but United States Armed Forces will be stationed in and about Japanfor an indefinite period of time.    The United States has indicated that itwould accept this proposal.    Under it, the United States would presumably,as its contribution to the security of Japan, provide the bulk of sea and airpower, while Japan might in due course be in a position to provide the bulkof land power.    Hence, Japan would not possess a national force which, of itself, could be an offensive threat, and the relationship between victor andvanquished would be so intimate and integrated as to make incredible a war of revenge.We are convinced that co-operative working arrangements for collective security such as we contemplate with Japan are greatly to be preferred to treaty limitations.    These read well, but the hope placed in them usually is illusory.    The recent peace treaties with Bulgaria,Rouma?iia and Hungary are an illustration.    Within less than five years,the limitations are grossly violated.In the case of Japan we seek not the form but the substance of security, both for Japan and for Japan&apos;s neighbours.ANNEX CARTICLE 6(a) Japan accepts the obligations set forth in Article 2 of the charter of the United Nations, and in particular obligations(i)     to settle its international disputes by peaceful means insuch a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered;
(ii)     to refrain in its international relations from the threator use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state or in any othermanner inconsistent with the Purposes of the united nations; &apos;(iii)     to give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with the Charter and to refrain from giving assistance to any state against which the United Nations may take preventive orenforcement action.(b) The Allied Powers, for their part, recognise that Japan as a sovereign nation possesses the inherent right of individual or collectiveself-defence referred to in the Charter of the United Nations and that japan may voluntarily enter into a collective security arrangement    _or arrangements participated in by one or more of the Allied Powers/.
