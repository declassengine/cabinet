ttfk Q V- o\---&apos;KIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SE&apos;CREThiCP.(51) 167 COPY NO.19TH JUNE, 1951CABINETMRS, FELT ONMemorandum by the Attorney-general  expect to receive a Report from the Director of public prosecutions towards the end of this week and to be in a position to announce my decision next Monday.2. In the event of my deciding not to prosecute Mrs. Felton, there isI think every likelihood that I shall be asked in a Supplementary Questionwhether, if she is not amenable to proceedings as the law stands, theGovernment intend to change the existing law.    It is probable that I shallhave a private notice Question on Monday as I will then be low in the listfor ordinary Parliamentary Questions and the House will no doubt not be content with a written answer.3. The dilemma is extremely difficult.    On the one hand, if in answer to a Supplementary I use some words to the effect that the Govern-ment have under consideration the question of changing the law, theGovernment will be virtually committed and constantly pestered with questions.    At the same time, it is very difficult to devise any change which would not unduly infringe freedom of expression and movement and yet would be enforceable.    On the other hand, there is undoubtedly a growing and natural public disquiet at the series of incidents such asPontecorvo, the Diplomats, now Mrs. Felton, and no doubt constantfurther incidents of this kind.    Furthermore, the constant misrepresen-tation in the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; of British participation in the Korean war isexasperating to public feeling and I have this afternoon a Question asking whether I will ask the Director of Public Prosecutions to report to me onthe &quot;Daily Worker&apos;s&quot; activities.    It is not as if we were just livingthrough a spate of such incidents which will come to an end.    The cold war will continue and if I should decide ret to prosecute Mrs. Felton othersmay take this as carte blanche for them to visit North .,orea as much asthey like.    To the average person it may seem fantastic that when Britishtroops are engaged in all-out hostilities and, in some cases, sufferingconsiderable losses, it should be open to anybody, if the North Koreanswill allow them, to go behind the enemy lines and consort with those whoare doing their best to kill British soldiers.4. The immediate occasion of this paper is the question what Ishould say in answer to a Supplementary if asked;  but in any event, forthe above reasons, I think the time has come when the Government shouldreconsider the question whether changes in the law should be made.There is no power at the moment to prevent a British subject going to north Korea.    All that can be done is to withhold his passport but even then that does not prevent him from going there if the North Koreans will accept him without a passport.    To convict him of treason it must be
-      99shown that he adhered to the enemy as well as gave them comfort whichI think means that it must be shown that he had an intention to assist theenemy against the King.5. The Cabinet have previously considered the possibility of aspecial security measure and there is in draft a Bill entitled &quot;the overseas Operations (Security of Forces) Bill&quot;.    The Cabinet on ZOthNovember, 1950, decided that the Bill &quot;should not be introduced inpresent circumstances&quot; (C.M.(^50) 76th Conclusions, Minute 7).6. The kind of answer which I suggest I might give is that &quot;TheGovernment have under consideration whether, consistently with thepreservation of the personal freedoms which in this country we regard as indispensable, changes in the existing lav/ should be made&quot;.    Thisanswer is designed to leave vague the matters with which the law would deal - i. e. :  whether it should relate to preventing persons going to-..orea, publications, acts of sabotage, etc.    It would be undesirable to tie oneself down to any specific topic.7. If I decide not to prosecute Mrs. Felton, I feel that, in view ofthe wide implications of the case, I must make some very brief statement and I would like authority, even without being asked a Supplementary, toinclude some such sentence in my statement.In these circumstances, I invite the Cabinet to decide:(a) Whether I should, in the event of my deciding not to prosecute,make some such statement as I suggest in paragraph 6 above.(b) If the answer to ^a) is in the negative, whether I should make some such statement in reply to a Supplementary and, if not,how I should answer such a Supplementary.(c) Whether I should make any other and what form of statementinstead of that which I suggest.F.S.Royal Courts of justice, W.C.2,19TH JUNE, 1951.ANNEX .  .PARLIAMENTARY QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED BY the attorney-GENERAL ON MONDAY, 25TH :UNE, 1951MR.
