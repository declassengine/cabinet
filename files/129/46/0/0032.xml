THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY  OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government,fir,      ^ -     :P^y^d.yfor&apos;0 1951 -confidential cp. (51) 18221th June, 1951:u,-.Copy No. 31CABINETSTAFF FOR DEFENCE WORKMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer was charged to report on the results of the replies to the Prime Minister^invitation (CP. (51) 36) to Ministers in charge of Departments to &quot; consider to what extent they can discontinue or retard the peace-time activities of their departments in order that staff may be made available for defence work.&quot;2. Departments were asked to divide their proposals into three main categories (a) the less disruptive;(b) the more disruptive; .(c) the really drastic amounting in effect to going on to a war-time basis.The Annex shows the staff offered for release by the main Departments. In a Servicetotalling some 675,000 staff, the numbers offered are only 1,823, 1,944 and 5,791under (a), (b) and (c) respectively.3. This general result is quite unsatisfactory. One or two Departments, notably the Ministry of Education, Ministry of National Insurance and the Ministry ofPensions, have produced substantial proposals. On the other hand, the service departments and the Ministry of Supply have taken it as more or less axiomaticthat none of their activities can be discontinued or retarded; and some civil Depart-ments, for example, the Ministry of Food, have taken the line that they have noactivities which should be discontinued or retarded short of the actual outbreak,I or at any rate imminence, of war.  No Civil. Departments have offered to curtail* their activities appreciably.4. Further, it seems clear that many of the proposals in the &apos;c drastic &quot; cate-gory are likely to be quite unacceptable in any circumstances short of imminentwar. This means that the reductions we can regard as immediately practicableamount to only about 3,750. .5.  The requirements for defence work arise mainly in three fields (i) the engineering and works (professional and sub-professional);(ii) the scientific (professional and sub-professional);(iii) the clerical.6. How far can these shortages be met from the savings offered by otherDepartments? As regards works and scientific staffs the outstanding deficit is put at,000 for the former, the shortage of draughtsmen being particularly acute, and1,000 for the latter. Since the Civil Departments employ relatively few staffs inthese grades, the contribution they can make is extremely limited and could not inany event meet all the defence requirements.7.  The situation is, of course, different as regards clerical staff, since thereare plenty of these available if the Civil Departments were prepared to release themby reducing their activities.   The proposals actually made by the Civil Depart-ments, however, omitting for the time being the &quot; drastic &quot; category, would still1 leave a deficit of 2,000.40809
8. This means that, unless we take special steps, the size of the Civil Service(including the civilians employed in the Defence Departments), instead of decreas-ing, as it has in the last 2% years, will increase substantially. Indeed, this change hasalready started and the staff return-for 1st - April shows an increase of 300 overthe last quarter. It is imperative to take early action to cut out the unnecessarywork in the Civil Departments. -Action recommended 19.  This can be briefly stated as follows:-(i) Works Staff. On the &quot;works &quot; side it has already been decided that theDepartments concerned (Ministry of Works, Admiralty, Air Ministry,Ministry of Supply and War Office) should jointly review their activitiesso as to ensure that the technical and professional staff are deployedand employed to the best advantage in present circumstances. I wel-come the development and propose.to keep in close touch with theresults of the investigations.(ii) Scientific Staff-Parallel action is called for as regards scientific staff,and I propose that Sir Henry Tizard should be asked to arrange for asimilar examination to be made, on my behalf, of the scientific research and development work now being done in the Service, with a view to.cutting out less essential work and so releasing scientific staff for the, Defence programme,(iii) Curtailment of Departmental activities. I have instructed the treasury to pursue all the proposals put forward by Departments under the&quot; less disruptive &quot; and &quot; more disruptive &quot;headings: some of them havealready been approved and are being carried out.10. In addition I ask for authority to arrange, in consultation as necessary with my colleagues, for ad hoc investigations to be carried put in any field of depart-mental activity the urgency and importance of which in present circumstances may seem to me to be open to question, or which seems to involve a disproportionateuse of man-power. I propose to invite one or two independent investigators toundertake this task. I shall ask one of them to consider especially the employment on non-defence work of works staff, and to report to me on the decisions whichwould need to be taken to enable such staff to be released for defence work. (In thisconnection it has to be borne in rnind that curtailment of activities in Whitehall will help to release local government professional and technical staff.) This investigatorwill, of course, need to keep in close touch with those making the enquiry referredto in paragraph 9 (i).11. These investigations will, I hope, produce proposals for administrativechanges which can be accepted, perhaps at some inconvenience or loss of efficiency,but nevertheless fairly readily. But they will also undoubtedly involve the possi- ,bility of major-policy decisions. This prospect must, I am sure, be faced: the time has come when we must cut out or slow down work on projects which, howeverdesirable they may be in themselves and however disappointing it will be to deferthem, cannot be justified in present circumstances, when our resources must be concentrated on the paramount requirements of defence.12. I hope I shall have the co-operation of my colleagues in making theseinvestigations effective. The scope for my own enquiries will, of course, be lessenedto the extent to which Departments themselves have in the meantime producedproposals for savings.H.
