*4 ****-U2(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC-MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(51) 200 COPY NO. 3111TH JULY, 1951CABINETPERSIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsAccording to a Reuter report from New York dated 10th July,the Persian Government have notified the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations (sending a copy of their message to the Hague Court)that in their view the Hague Court had no competence to deal with theapplication improperly made to it by His Majesty&apos;s Government;  the message also makes various allegations (but not a formal complaint)about British actions.    If the Persians did nothing more, and stoppedharassing the Company, it is just - but only just - conceivable that thepresent position might be maintained:  we for our part do not wish to do anything contrary to the Courfs injunction.    It is highly unlikely,however, that the Persians will hold their hand.    We may reasonablyassume that the Persian message amounts to a rejection of the HagueCourfs findings, and that Persian interference with the Company will goon, perhaps with greater emphasis.    We may also assume that thePersian Governments formal reply to President Truman&apos;s latestapproach to Dr. Mussadiq will confirm the oral rejection already announced.    On those assumptions, and after consultation with theCompany, I put forward the recommendations in this paper.2. The Prime Minister and I have considered together the questionof the use of force for the protection of the Company&apos;s property, as dis-tinct from the protection of British lives.    The arguments in favour are -(a)    that there is a feeling in certain sections, of Parliament, thePress and the public in.favour of &apos;fetrong measures&quot;;(b) that evidence of our readiness and ability to protect our interests would raise our prestige, notably in the middle east;  and(c) that a show of force might be the quickest and most effective way of bringing the Persians to their senses.3. On the other hand, the Attorney-General recorded on 25th May,1951, the opinion that &quot;the United Kingdom has no right at all in inter-national law independently of any United Nations1 recommendation to intervene by force in Persia.....&quot;.    If, then, we were to use force in persia, even though we appealed simultaneously to the Security Council,it is most probable that we should not only alienate American and world opinion generally (which has swung firmly towards our case), but should run the risk of an eventual resolution in the United Nations calling on usto withdraw. There is the further consideration that, if force appearedto be about to threaten Persia, our nationals in the oilfields might beplaced in jeopardy before we could extricate them.    There is the
possibility that the refinery and oilfields might suffer serious damage in the course of fighting;  and there is the even more serious considera-tion that an attempt to maintain the Company in Persia with Britishbayonets would prejudice the Persians permanently against the Company.Our conclusion therefore was that force had better be ruled out.4. H.M. Ambassy at Teheran and the Company&apos;s representatives in Persia are convinced both that the British staff cannot continue intheir present difficult circumstances and that to withdraw them is thebest means of bringing the Persians in general to their senses and sohastening a change of government;  the statements already made that thestaff would have to withdraw if present conditions went on, it is argued,have been regarded by the Persians as bluff.    The Chairman of theAnglo-Iranian Oil Company is confident that, if the Company were towithdraw, he could assemble sufficient staff to re-open the operationswhen agreement that the Company should return had been reached witha successor government;  and there are signs that a &apos;moderate&quot; party is emerging in the Persian Parliament.5. In view of the above considerations, I recommend that we shouldtake the following steps :-(a) An announcement (perhaps by myself, in the House) on the linesof Annex A to this paper, to the effect that, owing to Persianactions, His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided to withdraw the British personnel of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, in aphased evacuation which would begin at once with the men inthe oilfields (as distinct from the refinery at Abadan).(b) The despatch of a letter frte the President of the Hague Court,on the lines of Annex B to this paper, in order to notify him as an act of courtesy of the step which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment had been compelled to take since it was not possible forthem, owing to Persian action, to implement their acceptanceof the Courfs recommendations.6. It is for consideration whether we should at the same time seek a resolution in the Security Council calling upon the Persian Governmentto observe the recommendations of the Hague Court.    The main arguments for and against seem to be these.For(i)     The Hague Courfs ruling must be conveyed automatically to theSecurity Council, which to that extent will now be officiallycognisant of the dispute.    No positive duty is laid on theCouncil in the matter, but it is open to either party to appealto it.    The Persians might do so;  but it is they who arerejecting the Courfs injunction, and their message toMr. Trygve Lie shows that they do not intend to make a formal complaint about the presence of H.M.S. Mauritiusnear Abadan.    For us, having taken the matter to the Courtwithout satisfaction, it is the next logical step and would not prejudice the findings, favourable to our case, of the Hague court.    Public opinion here would demand that something bedone besides a withdrawal of the Company from Persia.
.; -  2u(ii) The United Kingdom representative will be in the Chair during july but would have to vacate it during discussion of our application, when the United States representative would take his place; and the present composition of the Council is as favourable as we could expect to obtain in any questioninvolving our interests.    The deciding factor would probablybe the attitude of the United States, and there seems to be noreason why we could not expect to obtain a majority.    Weshould have to expect a Russian veto on any resolutionfavourable to us, but morally our case would be advanced(even if the moral effect were somewhat reduced should theresolution take the form of calling on both parties to complywith the Courfs findings).(iii)     The present Persian Government feel able to reject the HagueCourfs findings, but adherence to the United Nations, whichextricated Persia from her trouble with Russia in 1946, is acardinal point in Persia*s policy;  even Mussadiq stated that principle when he became Prime Minister.    There is alreadyuneasiness in Teheran about the effects of flouting the Hague court, and for us now to take the case to the Security council would probably have a sobering effect;  it would certainlystrengthen the moderate Party which is in process of forming,and a body of opinion might grow up in the Persian parliament which would suffice to put Mussadiq out of power.    the eventual resolution secured in the Security Council would perhaps be of less importance, in this connection, than thevery fact that we had gone to the Security Council.Against(i)     The proceedings in the Security Council might be protracted.(ii)     We should not be able to assess what exactly the outcome mightbe; there would probably be much lobbying, and attemptsmight be made to produce some compromise formula whichwould not suit us (the Americans seem still to hanker after this).(iii) An appeal to the Security Council might make it more difficult for us to contemplate taking other measures, such for exampleas using force for any purpose other than the protection ofBritish nationals (but against this it must be noted that anannounced withdrawal of staff, if the first recommendation inthis paper is accepted, would not be altogether consistent withthe use of force).7. I suggest that the arguments in favour of going to the security council outweigh those against, and recommend therefore that we shouldappeal to the Council on the ground that the Persians, by refusing toaccept the recommendations of the Hague Court and by their actions,had created a situation in which it was impossible for us to observe theCourfs findings.    A draft resolution for submission to the Council isin Annex C,8. It is further suggested that, if the two foregoing recommendations are accepted, we should inform the United States Government of the action we propose to take and seek their support in the Security Council.
9. In brief, I would recommend:-(i)     That an announcement should be made to the effect that aphased withdrawal of the Anglo-Iranian Oil CompanyBritish personnel would be put into operation forthwith;(ii)r    that notification of this should be sent at the same time tothe President of the Hague Court;(iii)     that the matter should be taken to the Security Council;and(iv)    that we should inform the United States Government of theaction we are taking and seek their support in the Council.H.M.foreign Office, S.W.1,11TH JULY, 1951.
AJTOEX ADRAFT STATEMENT TO BE MADE IH PABLIAMENTThe Persian Government have sent a message to theSecretary-General of the United Itfations, and communicated acopy to the President of the International Court at The Hague.The message begins with an allegation that Britain,&quot;by internal intrigues and the fomenting of strikes and by sending warships and reinforcing ground and air troops nearPersia&quot;, was threatening the Government and the people of persia.     I wish to deny categorically that Britain hasthreatened the Government and people of Persia in any way,and to make clear that this Persian allegation is entirelyunfounded.      I would merely repeat that it is up to thePersian authorities to protect our nationals in Persia butthat, if the Persians do not discharge their responsibilities,then we shall take all practicable measures to look after our people.To return to the Persian message to Mr. Trygve Lie;after making its groundless allegations, it went on to saythat not only had the United Kingdom no right to take the case to the International Court but that the Court had no com-competence to hear it.Meanwhile, in Persia itself, government spokesmenand the Persian Press have left us in no doubt regarding theattitude of the Persian Government towards the Hague Courfsfindings.     That attitude, confirmed by the message toMr. Trygve Lie and the President of the Court, amounts to a flat rejection.      I need hardly recall that His majesty&apos;s government, for their part, signified their full acceptanceof the Court*s recommendations, and indeed we have madepositive proposals to the Persian Government about imple-menting them.     We have had no reply.
Not content with flouting the recommendations of .the highest, judicial authority in the world, the PersianGovernment and their Temporary Board of Directors in Abadanhave continued their policy of interfering at every turn withthe operations of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.     the cumulative effect of these acts of unwarranted interference,hindrance and obstruction has placed the Company in.an intolerable position.&quot;His Majesty1s Government and the Company havetaken, and still take, the line that the Company has everyright in international law and in common equity to be whereit is in Persia.     For that reason and for others which Ihave from time to time quoted, we have not wished the british personnel to withdraw.     We fully appreciated the strainunder which they were working.     But we had to ask them to goon.     That became the more necessary when the Hague Courfsrecommendations were made requiring no action to be taken by either party which would aggravate the situation and, indeed,which.required the Company to continue its operations.We have done our best to observe those recommenda-tions.     We are as ready as we ever were to observe them, ifwe can.     We are still prepared, for that matter, to nego-tiate a solution to this dispute direct with the PersianGovernment.     But there is no reciprocity of sentiment to bedetected in the present Persian Government.     On the con-trary, they have not only rejected all our proposals and friendly gestures but, by their actions, have made itimpossible for the Company to continue its normal operations,as the Hague Courfs findings clearly contemplated.     blame for this grave state of affairs rests solely withdraw. Mussadiq and his headstrong but, I believe, fairlysmall, following.
I have said that the Persians have made itimpossible for the Company to carry on its operations.     Nopurpose therefore would be served by our asking the british staff of the Anglo-Irani an Oil Company to remain at theirposts in the intolerable conditions which have been forced upon them by the Persians.     His Majesty&apos;s Government haveconsequently decided that all the British personnel of theCompany should be withdrawn from Abadan and the oilfields;and the Company, at our request, have drawn up a programme for a phased withdrawal which will begin at once with themen from the oilfields and end with those in Abadan.     Ifthe Persian attitude were to change, and the Persian Govern-ment were to decide to co-operate with us in implementing theCourfs recommendations, this process could be reversed.At the same time, we are notifying the President ofthe Hague Court of this decision which we have reluctantlybeen compelled to take since it is not possible for us,owing to Persian actions, to implement our acceptance of theCourfs recommendations.Finally, the United Kingdom representative to theUnited Nations has been instructed to submit the case to theSecurity Council.
Draft Letter to the President of the International&apos; &quot;1      &apos; Court of JusticeMr.  President,I have the honour, on instructions from His Majesty1sPrincipal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to refer to - the recent Order of the Court indicating interim measuresof protection to be taken in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Companycase.      Immediately on receipt of this Order the Governmentof the United Kingdom -publicly announced their acceptance ofit in full, notified the Government of Iran to that effect,and requested the Government of Iran to collaborate with theUnited Kingdom Government in appointing the Board of supervision proposed by the Court,      I now regret to have toinform you that the Government of Iran have announced theirrejection of the Courfs recommendations and have ignored the,approach made to them by the Government of the United Kingdom,They are at the same time persisting in the actions andinterferences with the Company&apos;s operations which led theGovernment of the United Kingdom to make their recent request to the Court for the indication of interim measures ofprotection.      In these circumstances it has become impossiblefor the Company to continue its operations in the mannerclearly contemplated by the recommendations of the Court,I have to inform you, therefore, that, as announced by theSecretary of State for Foreign. Affairs in the House of commons to-day, it has become necessary to arrange for the progressivewithdrawal of all the British personnel of the Company fromthe oil fields and Abadan, and that a programme for a phasedwithdrawal has been drawn up and will be put into operationforthwith.      This&apos;step, which is entirely consequential uponthe Persian attitude and actions above described, has beennecessitated, by the fact that it is impracticable to keepthis personnel in Persia in circumstances in which theCompany&apos;s undertaking can no longer function-and the progressive closing down of the installations is inevitable.The present communication is sent for the information ofthe Court in order that it may know what action theUnited Kingdom Government is taking and upon what grounds.This action does not imply any rejection of the recentrecommendations of the Court concerning interim measureswhich the Government of the United Kingdom remain fullywilling to implement if similarly carried out by theGovernment of Iran.I have the honour to be, etc.for the Agent of the Governmentof the United Kingdom
