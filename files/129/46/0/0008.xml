SECRETCP.(51) 158 COPY NO, 219TH JUNE, 1951CABINETJAPANESE PEACE TREATY:   CHINESE PARTICIPATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 7th June (C.M.(51) 41st Conclusions, Minute 1) the cabinet decided to invite me, in further discussions with Mr. Dulles, to press fora solution of the problem of Chinese participation in the Treaty on thelines of the proposals explained in paragraphs 18 - 20 of C.P.(51) 137,namely, that neither Government of China should sign the Treaty, but thatthere should be an accession clause providing for China to accede to itwhen certain specific conditions, requiring a more general measure ofagreement among the other signatories on Chinese and Far Easternquestions generally, had been fulfilled.Views of Mr. Dulles.2. On representations being made to him accordingly, Mr. Dullesreplied that he regretted he could not go any further to meet us than was represented by the proposal set out in paragraph 6(c) of C.P.(51) 155,namely that the Treaty should be signed by neither Government of China.In particular he argued strongly against any attempt to insert in the Treatya provision limiting Japan&apos;s right to conclude any peace settlement with china until more general agreement about Chinese participation had been secured among the signatories of the multilateral treaty.    He made use ofthe following arguments to support his views:-(a) On the merits of the case, the question was, did we intend by our peace Treaty to make Japan fully sovereign, or not?    If, as he assumed, we did, he felt it would be inconsistent at the same timeto set up what amounted to a &apos;fcommittee&quot; (i. e. any definedproposal for a two-thirds majority of the principal parties to theTreaty), which after the coming into effect of the Peace treaty was expected to go on running the most important part of Japan&apos;s foreign policy, namely, her relations with China.    The responsi-bility for anything that went wrong between Japan and China wouldthen rest on our shoulders, and in addition a lasting source ofdiscord would be created among the western Allies themselves.(b) Secondly, on internal political grounds in the United States, he felt that the proposal was quite impracticable and indeed, ifpursued further, would be likely to wreck the whole Treaty.All treaties require a two-thirds majority in the United StatesSenate before they can be ratified;  even assuming that all the democratic Senators voted in favour of this Treaty (which wasnot certain) it would still be necessary to get about half the republican Senators to vote in favour as well;  Mr. Dulles, asa Republican himself, could assure us that in the present stateTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS-BRITANNIC MAJEST-Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
of United States politics this would not be feasible.    once the Treaty had been repudiated by the United States Senatethe whole peace settlement would of course be thrown back into the melting-pot.Comment.3. It may be useful at this stage to recapitulate very shortly thecourse of our discussions on this point.    Originally we maintained thatthe Central People&apos;s Government must sign the Treaty and not the nationalists, while the Americans maintained that the Nationalists mustsign and not the Central People&apos;s Government.    In the second stage of thenegotiations, we told the Americans that if they would drop their insistence on Nationalist participation, we would drop our insistence on Communistparticipation, so that neither China would sign the Treaty.    Mr. Dulleshas now agreed to recommend to his Government that they should no longerinsist on Nationalist participation.    From our point of view this step tomeet us was of course essential.    From the American point of view it isa most important and, in the present state of United States politics,courageous decision.    Mr. Dulles warned us that when he returns to theUnited States he will be subjected to violent criticism on this point fromthe ^acArthur&apos;1 wing of the Republican Party, and that he may possibly be repudiated.4. Looked at more broadly, the question of Chinese participation hasnow become a cardinal point on which other outstanding questions depend.If we can solve it, we can also solve the problems of Formosa, andprobably of the Congo Basin Treaties.    The Americans have taken a major step to meet us, and it would be a disaster if, when agreement was so nearly achieved, it should nevertheless be missed with all the serious and wider implications which that would have, over a dispute which is now more one of legal interpretation than of substance or principle.5. My colleagues may feel that there is force in both the points madeby Mr. Dulles (paragraph 2 above).6. As regards (a), Mr. Dulles1 interpretation of international law is correct.    Once the Peace Treaty came into force, Japan as a sovereignand independent state would be free to conclude her own agreements with china, unless prohibited from doing so in the Treaty.    This type of limitation on the freedom of a defeated state has not been inserted in any previous recent peace settlement.    His Majesty*s Government agree to theprinciple of a non-restrictive Treaty, and it would seem inconsistent ifthey should now wish to go back on the general principle and impose in theTreaty a new restriction, of a quite unprecedented kind, on Japan&apos;s freedom.7. As regards argument (b), Mr. Dulles speaks with authority on united States internal politics and I suggest that we must accept his con-clusion on this point.8. A further argument against attempting to restrict Japanrs freedom to make her own settlement with China after the Peace Treaty comes intoforce is that it would be unwise, unworkable in practice, and bad propagandaas well, for a group of Powers, most of them western, to take on themselves the responsibility of guiding the course of relations between two importantAsiatic peoples with a long history of direct contacts.
9. I think Mr. Dulles is not unconscious of the fact that there exists in this country a suspicion of United States motives in framing the JapaneseTreaty; a suspicion in fact that the United Sta.tes will seek to persuadeJapan to conclude a treaty with Chiang Kai-shek and thereafter to use boththe Japanese and the Nationalists in an attempt to overthrow the present regime in China.    But Mr. Dulles himself is known to be opposed toChiang Kai-shek, and he has not only denied that the Uni ed States would seek to force Japan into a treaty with Chiang Kai-shek but has actuallysuggested in conversation that His Majesty&apos;s Government who, as he put it, are not without influence with the Japanese, should use their influence to dissuade Japan from such a course.10. It therefore amounts to this: that a refusal to reach agreementwith the United States on the question of Chinese participation is tantamount to an indication that His Majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared to acceptthe good faith of Mr. Dulles as a negotiator or of the United States Govern-mer-t.    I need not emphasise the effect upon Anglo-American relations ofsuch a course.11. Were the United States Government, however, to show themselvesunworthy of the trust which it is suggested we should place in them, thereis no need for His Majesty1 s Government to accept the situation whichwould be created if Japan were to conclude a Peace Treaty with chiang kai-shek -shek after the conclusion of the multilateral treaty to which we shouldbe a party.    We can, I submit, do no more than safeguard our own positionand our own relationship with the Central People&apos;s Government, and I con-sider that this position is safeguarded by the proposed terms of the present draft to which Mr. Dulles now seeks our agreement.12. On his return to the United States on Thursday, 14th June,Mr. Dulles will, if he has reached agreement on the draft Treaty, have toensure its acceptance by the Administration who for their part will wishto be assured of ultimate approval by the United States Senate.    If on theother hand no agreement is reached by Thursday this is bound to becomepublic knowledge, and I share Mr. Dulles&apos; anxiety as to the consequences of the breach which would then result.Recommendations.13. (a)    That we should accept the substance of the arrangements proposed as a result of discussion with Mr. Dulles, which is as follows:(i)     The preamble of the Treaty would not name the &quot;Allied Powers&quot;,but their determination waald depend upon the operation of anew article in the final clauses which would, in substance,specify that -&quot;Allied Powers, for the purpose of the present Treaty,shall be deemed to be those States at war with Japanwhich have signed the present Treaty&quot;.(ii)     No Chinese Government would be invited to sign the Treaty andthere would be no accession clause.

(iii) There would, however, be an article on the following lines:&quot;Japan will be prepared to conclude with any state whichsigned and adhered to the United Nations Declaration ofJanuary 1, 1942, and which is at war with Japan and whichis not a signatory of this Treaty, a bilateral treaty ofpeace on the same or substantially the same terms as are provided for in the present treaty, but this obligation onthe part of Japan will expire three years after the cominginto force of the present Treaty pursuant to Article 23 a.Japan will not, however, make a peace settlement or warclaims settlement with any state which would grant that state greater- advantages than provided by the presentTreaty unless those same advantages are extendedpari passu to the parties hereto, &quot;(iv) That the interests of the Chinese people should, however, betaken care of by special automatic provisions on the lines ofthe present Article 12 (renunciation of Japanese special rightsand interests in China) covering other items such as the dis-posal of Japanese assets in China,(v)       That the signatories should recognise that under internationallaw the responsibility for solving the problem of Japan&apos;future relations with China must necessarily be laid by thePeace Treaty on Japan herself, once she has regained hersovereign and independent status with the coming into forceof the Treaty.(b)    That an agreed announcement on the basis of the draft annexed tothis memorandum should be issued simultaneously with the Treaty,(The actual terms of this statement have not been discussed with the americans.)H.M.Foreign Office, S.W.1,9TH JUNE, 1951.
ANNEXCHINESE PARTICIPATION AND FORMOSA(Announcement to be made simultaneously with the signature of the draft)draft the Powers signing the Peace Treaty with Japan recognise thatthey are not agreed among themselves on the question of which Govern-ment is the legal Government of China.    They are agreed that this factshould not be allowed to delay the Japanese Peace Settlement any further,and it has, therefore, been necessary for the present Treaty to be concludedwithout signature by either Government of China.2. The Powers who are signatories of this Treaty have felt that inthese circumstances they should make a special effort to safeguard theinterests of the Chinese people.    They have, therefore, included in theTreaty certain provisions to this express purpose which will take effectwhen the Treaty comes&apos; into force, in spite of the fact that China is not represented among the signatories, for instance by providing in Article 11of the Treaty for Japan to renounce all her special rights and interests inChina.3. The signatory Powers recognise that under international law theresponsibility for solving the problem of japan s future relations with china must necessarily be laid by the Peace Treaty on Japan herself,once she regains her sovereign and independent status with the coming intoforce of the Treaty.    The Peace Settlement has been so framed as not to prejudice this important principle.4. The Treaty deals with the problem of Formosa in the same spirit.In Article 2 it provides for Japan to renounce her sovereignty over Formosa.The Treaty does not try to prejudge the future of the island, which is still to be discussed by the United Nations, but leaves it open for a future settlement, in Which the interests of the people of Formosa will not be overlooked. nD
