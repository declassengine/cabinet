HIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1951CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.   3 c.p.. (51) 21630/// July, 1951CABINETINTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE, GENEVA, JUNE 1951Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service the 34th Session of the International Labour Conference was held in Genevafrom 6th-30th June. Delegates from sixty Member States attended, the totalnumber of delegates and advisers being 603. The United Kingdom was, as usual,represented by a strong tripartite delegation. The triennial Governing Bodyelections were held in the course of the Conference, and the newly constitutedGoverning Body held its first meeting on 30th June.Address to the Conference by the Minister of Labour and National service. I spent a week at the Conference and found it most useful to have this opportunity of meeting a number of other visiting Ministers and principal delegates from other countries. I spoke in the debate on the Director-GeneraFs Report,which concentrated special attention on the problem of wages policy in conditionsof full employment. My speech is reproduced in Annex T to this paper. TheMinister of Labour and National Insurance, Northern Ireland (Major the right on. Ivan Neill, M.P.), was also present for part of the session.President, Vice-Presidents and others3. There were some preliminary difficulties regarding the election of President.The Minister of Labour for Brazil, who was intended for the office, at the last moment did not come. It was made known that Dr. Malik, Minister of Labour,Pakistan, would like the appointment but objections were raised to this on thegrounds that India had the Presidency last year and the Commonwealth had had it four times in seven years. In the end the Conference, on the proposal of theGovernment of Pakistan, elected Mr. William Rappard, the chief Swiss Govern-ment Delegate, Professor of Economics and Director of the Institute of HigherInternational Studies at the University of Geneva. The Vice-Presidents were:Mr. Garcia Aybar (Government Delegate, Dominican Republic); Mr. W. Gemmill(Employers&apos; Delegate, Union of South Africa); and Mr. Aftab Ali (Workers&apos;Delegate, Pakistan). The Chairmanships of the various committees were distributedbroadly upon a geographical basis.4. Mr. Rappard, apart from one or two occasions when he showed aninclination to throw responsibility back on to the Conference, proved a very happychoice as chairman dignified, firm and impartial throughout. Otherwise, theConference threw up no outstanding new personality, although perhaps mentionshould be made of the oratorical gifts of the Workers&apos; Delegate from Israel,Mr. Nathan Bar-Yaakov. His speech in Plenary Session on the proposal to admitGermany to membership was a masterpiece of restrained emotion and must haveattracted many votes had not the issue been in effect decided in advance. If his power of negotiation and ability in administration equal his gift of eloquence heshould go far.40958 &quot; &apos;&quot; B
General Results and Impressions of the conference. On the whole the results of the Conference are satisfactory to us and theGovernment Delegation achieved their principal objectives, except in the case of the  item &quot; Equal Pay.&quot; The policy which we have consistently adopted ot sending to these Conferences representatives of experience who are knowledgeable in theirsubjects pays handsome dividends, and I am indebted to those of my ministerialcolleagues who were so good as to spare the services of experienced officers forthis important work.6. I shall in due course be issuing the usual White Paper containing a detailedaccount of the Conference proceedings. Later paragraphs of this paper, however,contain brief notes on some of the principal subjects discussed. Apart from theGoverning Body elections, the chief interest was, perhaps, centred on the discussions on equal pay and social security. Some of the contributions to the debate on theDirector-GeneraFs Report readied a high standard. On the other hand, a very high proportion of them were previously prepared set speeches in which the speakers made little attempt to relate what they had to say to the remarks ofother speakers. Moreover, it was found necessary to hold meetings of the principalConference Committees at the same time as the debates in Plenary Session. this meant that a large number of delegates only received a full account of theproceedings when they read them in the following day&apos;s Provisional Record.The proceedings of the Conference suggested that the standing procedure may not,in all respects, be well adapted to present day conditions, which differ widelv fromthose which existed when the procedure was originally established. The Conferencedecided to request the Governing Body to examine this question and report backto the Conference.The Atmosphere of the Conference7. There were some disturbing features. Last year and even more this year,there has been a distinct deterioration in the standard of co-operation betweenthe three groups (Government, employers and workers) in the pursuit of realisticpolicies. As has been noted in previous reports, a feature of International LabourConferences since the war has been the tendency for all delegates, of whatevergroup, to pool their experience and try to arrive by common agreement at practicalresults which wouid be regarded as acceptable by a large number of Member States.This year has marked an unwelcome return to pre-war mentality. Group loyaltyis again showing a tendency to take the place of the wider co-operation. In theWorkers&apos; Group discipline is very strong and it was always difficult to get the group to modify in full committee a line which they had decided to adopt in a groupmeeting. Moreover, in general, the Workers&apos; Group displayed a slavish attachmentto texts circulated by the Office, and more than once rejected amendments whichwould clearly have improved a text from their point of view. Discipline and grouployalty in the Employers&apos; Group are less strict, and it is sometimes possible todetach individual employers from their group policy; but as a whole they were as little prepared to make a joint effort towards a co-operative solution as theWorkers&apos; Group. As the less responsible members of the latter group could alwaysfind a number of irresponsible Government delegates ready to support them in extreme policies, and as a number of other Government delegates were too timidto show their hands at all, the task of the responsible Government delegates in trying to keep the regulations on sensible lines was no easy one. It says much for our own Government representatives and for the moderating influence exercised by our British workers&apos; and employers&apos; representatives (under the experiencedleadership of Mr. Alfred Roberts and Sir John Forbes Watson, who, fortunatelywere again elected the leaders of the Workers&apos; and Employers&apos; Groups respectivelyof the whole Conference) that the Conference achieved results which, with a few exceptions, were realistic and acceptable both to us and probably generally.The Latin American Influence8. But perhaps the really disturbing feature of this year&apos;s Conference wasthe evidence it gave of the increasing power of the Latin American Governmentbloc. This has been noted on previous occasions, but the Latin American countries are now becoming more conscious of their power and show every intention of using it. When they stand together, and they generally do, their sixteen Govern-ments alone command a solid block of thirty-two votes. They can and do vote for the most extreme provisions in international regulations without embarrassment
since any of them seldom implement Conventions even when they ratify them.Hitherto they have held themselves somewhat aloof from other combinations, butare now coming to realise how immensely greater their authority becomes whenthey ally themselves with other groups like the Asian group and the Middle Eastgroup of countries. This year the Latin American Government group practicallydictated the results of the elections for the Governing Body; they offered what somedelegates regarded as a serious affront to the I.L.O. by including in their ownthree nominations for the Governing Body Venezuela, whose workers wereunseated by the Conference only a year ago on the grounds that they did not really represent the workers of Venezuela and which this year did not sendany workers at all to the Conference; the Latin American group voted in strength in favour of a convention on &quot;Equal Pay&quot;; and some of them spoke in favourof the principle of a resolution put forward by the Government of Poland for a revision of the Colonial article in the I.L.O. Constitution. No doubt it would bedifficult, if not impossible, to find an acceptable alternative for the principle of&quot; one State, one vote &quot;: but the major Powers will surely one day have to face thequestion how long they can tolerate elections being determined and policies beingmade by a group of States which, whether financially or otherwise, make so littlecontribution to the solution of international problems.Relations with other Delegations9. Our relations with the delegates from other countries were always excellent,and on most matters we found them extremely anxious to know and understandour point of view. As a result we were able generally to exert considerable influence on the course of discussion.10. Our relations with the Commonwealth delegates have never been more friendly and cordial. These delegates looked to us for a lead, and wherever theycould they went along with us it was seldom, indeed, that any of them differed from us. The continuity of representation from all the Commonwealth countries has meant that we have all got to know each other and have mutual confidence ineach other. It is worth mentioning in particular the attitude of the Indian Govern-ment delegates who, when, as sometimes happened, the general Commonwealthview was in conflict with the general Asian view, not infrequently adopted theformer. Moreover, they at all times showed what to us seemed to be a deep sense of responsible leadership amongst Asian countries. By contrast, the Pakistandelegation led by Dr. Malik, Minister of Labour, was more inclined to take anAsian view, and that delegation differed from us more than any of the other commonwealth delegations. Thus, in the elections to the Governing Body,Pakistan agreed with the Latin Americans to support a &quot; list &quot; which did not includeAustralia: in the elections to the Asian Advisory Committee, Dr. Malik tried toget a purely Asian &quot; list &quot; elected, although Australia and New Zealand come withinthe geographical region covered by the Committee; in the Governing Bodynominations to the same Committee, Dr. Malik wished to go back on the &quot; gentle-mans agreement &quot; that two European Metropolitan Powers having responsibilities in the region would be nominated; and Pakistan abstained on the Polish resolutionseeking a revision of the Colonial article of the I.L.O. Constitution. Despite thesemanifestations of Asian feeling possibly due to a desire to capture from india the leadership of Asia in the I.L.O. our personal relationships with the Pakistandelegation were as friendly as with other Commonwealth delegations, and they,even&quot;more than most of the others, looked to us for advice and leadership on themore technical items.Governing Body Elections11. We were not directly concerned with the Governing Body elections since we hold a permanent seat and have no vote in the elections. Our concern was touse our influence as well as we could behind the scenes in the interests first of commonwealth countries and of the other countries who, we felt, ought to be giventhe opportunity to serve on the Governing Body. The elections were noteworthyfor the intensity of the preliminary lobbying in which the Latin American countries were particularly prominent. As has already been indicated, these countriescommand a large vote, and the &quot; courting &quot; to which they were subjected by othercountries soon made them realise their power. When Pakistan, supported by aconsiderable number of the Asian States, sought the Latin American vote, thelatter found themselves in a position, of which they took full advantage, to demand
in return Asian support not only for the three Latin American candidates but also for all the other candidates whom the Latin Americans favoured. There is clear evidence that the Latin Americans demanded a similar undertaking from other groups who sought their support. The Latin American &quot; ticket &quot; consisted of sevenfirm candidates, delegates being permitted latitude to vote for either Poland orPortugal for the eighth place. In due course the full Latin American &quot; ticket&quot;was elected, Portugal defeating Poland after several ballots. One unfortunatefeature of the election was that Pakistan and her Asian allies, in order to make sure of the Latin American vote, threw overboard Australia who, as a consequence,lost her seat. Australia understood that she would be supported both by pakistan and by the Latin Americans, and Pakistani defection caused a certain strain in therelations between the two members of the Commonwealth, which was not easedeven by Australia^ subsequent election as a Deputy Member of the governing body. Poland&apos;s defeat cuts the remaining link between the Governing Body and eastern Europe and is regretted by many countries on this ground.12. The part played by the Latin American bloc in this election has causedmuch apprehension to many States, even those who in the confusion of the finalfew days&apos; lobbying acquiesced in her proposals. They have begun to realise the dangers of permitting one bloc in effect to determine the whole election, and theview was widely expressed that steps must be taken in time to see that this doesnot happen again. Certainly it is essential that some of the smaller groups, especiallyamong the European States, should combine to combat the Latin American influenceif they do not wish to run the risk of being completely excluded from the governing body.13. In the elections for the employers&apos; and workers&apos; groups Sir John ForbesWatson and Mr. Alfred Roberts were again elected.14. The complete composition of the new Governing Body is shown in annex II.Asian Advisory Committee of the Governing Body15. There were three seats open for election and two for nomination by theGoverning Body. The elected seats were filled by Australia, Ceylon and Indonesia.On the proposal of India, the Governing Body nominated France and the UnitedKingdom to the other two seats.Germany and Japan admitted to Membership16. The Federal Republic of Germany and Japan were admitted to member-ship in the course of the session, although the membership of Japan is still subjectto formal confirmation by the Japanese Diet. The applications for membership ofthese two countries raised a constitutional issue of considerable importance. TheI.L.O. has always been unwilling to admit any country to membership withoutpositive assurances that that country will be completely free to fulfil all the obliga-tions and responsibilities of membership without intervention by any other partywhatsoever. In the case of Germany advance discussions resulted in satisfactory assurances to this effect being given in a declaration by the High Commission.Similar discussions in relation to Japan brought from the Supreme Commander,Allied Powers (S.C.A.P.), a corresponding formula which was, however, not accept-able since it reserved to the Supreme Commander final authority and did not giveJapan that full freedom in I.L.O. affairs which was regarded as necessary for membership. The United States Government, in the course of exchanges through diplomatic channels, showed reluctance to modify S.C.A.P.&apos;s formula, for whichthey claimed wide support among other States members of the I.L.O. Conversa-tions with the representatives of other Governments at Geneva suggested that theUnited States greatly exaggerated the extent of this support, and discussions betweenthe United Kingdom and United States Government delegates quickly resulted inS.C.A.P. accepting the revised formula suggested by us. This ensured that japan would be admitted to membership without further difficulty.Yugoslavia resumes Membership17. Yugoslavia resigned from the I.L.O. in 1947. Since then tentativeenquiries have been made from time to time as to whether she should be encouraged
to return&quot;. In March last, my predecessor, Mr. Bevan, mentioned the matter to the Yugoslav Parliamentary delegation which was visiting this country at thetime and received an encouraging response. About the same time in Geneva, theUnited Kingdom Government delegate to the Governing Body of the I.L.O.discussed with the United States Ambassador to Belgrade (Mr. Allen, one of theablest of the United States diplomatic representatives) the question whether thetime was ripe for a joint United Kingdom-United States approach to the yugoslav government. Mr. Allen expressed the personal view that the time was ripe, andseems thereafter to have taken an early initiative in Belgrade which led to dis-cussions between the Yugoslav Government and the Director-General of the I.L.O.and, in June, to the resumption by Yugoslavia of her membership of the Organisa-tion. This is much to be welcomed, although from the purely British point of view it is a pity that, as the result of Mr. Allen&apos;s action, most of the credit for thisoutcome seems to be given to the United States.The A nglo-Iranian Dispute18. In a speech on the Director-GeneraFs Report, the Government Delegatefrom Iran delivered an attack upon the British Government and the Anglo-iranian oil Company, and I felt bound in my own speech to reply to these allegations insome detail. My remarks were later briefly referred to in a speech by the Workers&apos;Delegate from Iran. We had the opportunity of a talk with him beforehand, and found him obviously reluctant to enter into this controversy, but clearly subjectto strong pressure from his Government. In fact, he made it clear at the openingof his speech that he felt obliged &quot;to respond to the request of our Iranian government Delegate and to reply shortly to the statement made by the BritishGovernment representative in defence of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.&quot; Themain body of his speech contained pointed criticisms of the record of successivePersian Governments in labour and social matters.Uniting for Peace19. Following the arrangements approved by the General Assembly of theUnited Nations last autumn for emergency action by the Assembly for the main-tenance or restoration of international peace and security in the event of deadlockin the Security Council, the United States Government have attempted to get thevarious Specialised Agencies to pass resolutions undertaking to accede to requests for assistance from the General Assembly; they also wished the Agencies to amendtheir relationship agreements with the United Nations so as to provide for suchaction, but they did not press this later suggestion. The Foreign Ofnce, with thesupport of the other Departments, took a firm line against the United states proposal from the first, for it was clear that by passing such a resolution an Agencywould be committing itself in advance to carry out recommendations of theAssembly which can be passed by a majority and are not binding on member states of the United Nations. Such a course is not only incompatible with theautonomy of the Agencies, but would put individual Member States in theintolerable position of being bound in advance to do something through an Agencywhich they might vote against and refuse to be bound by in the Assembly. In thediscussions which took place on this matter in the I.L.O. our delegation wasembarrassed by the fact that the W.H.O. had just passed such a resolution as theUnited States were demanding with about 20 abstentions, including the UnitedKingdom. Nevertheless, we were able to persuade the United States delegation of the unwisdom of pressing such a resolution to a vote in the I.L.O. and, afterreferring to Washington, they, without tabling their own resolution, accepted ourdraft, which in its operative part confined itself to promising the General assembly and the Security Council all appropriate assistance from the I.L.O. in their effortsfor the maintenance or restoration of international peace and security. This was,I think, a very satisfactory outcome.20. I have referred at some length to this matter and to the negotiationsrelating to the admission of Japan (paragraph 16) because I think they show that if,in our dealings with the United States, we have a good case and act firmly, thatcountry can in general be counted upon to act reasonably. Nor does firmness insuch circumstances leave any resentment behind our relations with the UnitedStates in the I.L.O. have never been more cordial or more co-operative than theywere this year.
The Colonial Article in the I.L.O. Constitution21. The Polish Government tabled a resolution calling for the drastic amend-ment of this article and of the provisions relating to Federal States. Broadly, theColonial article in the I.L.O. Constitution embodies recognition of the constitutional position of non-metropolitan states and of the fact that their stage of developmentmay make the full and immediate application of I.L.O. Conventions to their terri-tories unsuitable, and it provides a procedure which facilitates the progressiveapplication to such states of the provisions of a Convention.22. The Resolutions Committee rejected the proposed resolution by a large majority, only one vote being cast in its favour. But it was raised again in plenary session on the report of the Resolutions Committee and was made the occasion ofthe usual vicious attacks upon the Colonial Powers by Poland and Czechoslovakia.In addition, the Mexican Government delegate (Mr. de Alba, who is well known inUnited Nations&quot; circles) while not supporting this particular resolution, spokestrongly in favour of the revision at an early date of these constitutional provisions.The vote disclosed only the Polish and Czech, delegates voting in favour of thePolish resolution, but there were a number of abstentions including some of the Latin American Governments and Pakistan. There is nodoubt that if the resolution had been put forward by a delegate not from an Iron Curtain country and if it had been confined to theColonial article and had not confused the issue by including the Federal Statesclause, it would have attracted considerable support both from the Latin american and from the Asian countries. The danger has been averted for this year, but wemust expect it to be raised again shortly and perhaps by more reputable sponsors.Finance23. The Conference approved a net expenditure budget of $6,224,922 for 1952.This figure is $251,133 more than that for 1951 but $437,674 less than that originallysubmitted by the Director-General, the reductions being secured mainly by theaction of Government representatives in which the United Kingdom played a leading part. The increase over 1951 is largely automatic, e.g., salary progression,the general rise in prices, &amp;c. The Conference also approved a scale of contri-butions for States Members under which the United Kingdom will pay $818,468 ascompared with $804,120 for 1951. A reduction in the United Kingdom per-centage contribution for 1952 to 13-15 as against 13-60 for 1951 was secured.Equal Remuneration for Men and Women Workers for Work of Equal Value24. In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet, the GovernmentDelegation pressed strongly that the international regulations on this subject shouldtake the form of a Recommendation. They argued this point of view in the Con-ference Committee, and, when unsuccessful there, proposed an amendment to thesame effect in Plenary Session. The Conference, however, decided that the regu-lations should take the form of a Convention supplemented by a Recommendation.Both in the Committee and in Plenary Session, the Delegation also moved an amendment designed to make the text of the Convention more generally acceptable.The amendment consisted of the proposed insertion of the words &quot; as rapidly as national conditions allow &quot; in the main operative article of the Convention. Theamendment was not accepted. The Government Delegation abstained on the finalvote on the Convention, pointing out that, in their view, it was unrealistic to suppose that more than a few States would be able to ratify a Convention in these terms.They also, made it clear that the Government was not opposed to the principle of equal pay, but that the principle could only be implemented when the economicconditions of the country permitted. The Government Delegation voted in favourof the supplementary recommendation, explaining that the Government would&quot; examine it carefully with the sincere desire of putting into effect when practicableany parts of it which may prove to be acceptable.&quot; We thus failed to attain our major objective of securing international regulations which would be immediatelyacceptable to us. This was a disappointment. There seemed at one time a distinctpossibility that the regulations would be cast in the form of a Recommendation.But the women&apos;s &quot; lobby,&quot; which was present in full force in Geneva, proved too strong.   The workers&apos; group was solid in favour of embodying the principle in a
Convention; the Latin American Governments were almost equally solid out of103 votes cast against our proposal for a Recommendation 21 were accounted forby these Governments; a number of employers, including those alleged employersfrom the Iron Curtain countries, also voted for a Convention; and a number oftimid Governments abstained. Nevertheless, I think we can claim to have taken the leading part in rendering these regulations more sensible and realistic than atone time seemed possible. Indeed, it is only by little although that little is decisive that the Convention fails to be such as we could ratify. I doubt if we could have achieved more in the distinctly emotional atmosphere which surrounds this par-ticular subject. At the same time I think there can be no doubt that we have come out of these discussions with our reputation in the I.L.O. not only unimpaired, butenhanced. Most representatives present understood and appreciated our position;and these discussions provide an outstanding example of the way in which, while not compromising our own position with regard to the method of approach that isbeing adopted, we can maintain our influence and authority in an international organisation by showing willingness to be conciliatory, helpful and co-operative in drafting. For the future it will be of interest to observe how many of those governments including all those from Latin America who rallied to the supportof the Convention will in fact ratify and implement it.Agriculture25. The Conference adopted a Convention and a Recommendation concern-ing minimum wage fixing machinery in agriculture. The main purpose of the Con-vention is to secure the creation or maintenance of adequate machinery for theestablishment of minimum rates of wages for agricultural workers. It looks as if weshould be able to ratify this Convention. The Recommendation contains a numberof supplementary provisions, including provisions as to the bases by reference towhich minimum wages in agriculture should be fixed. In this country, the considera-tions to be taken into account when fixing minimum wages are left to the discretion of the Agricultural Wages Boards. Apart from this point, however, the Recom-mendation should be generally acceptable to us. There was also a first discussion on a proposed Convention and Recommendation on Holidays with Pay in Agricul-ture. The conclusions adopted will form the basis for further consultation with governments in preparation for the second discussion at next year&apos;s Conference.Industrial Relations26. The Conference adopted two Recommendations dealing respectively withCollective Agreements and with Voluntary Conciliation and Arbitration. Some ofthe questions dealt with in these instruments (particularly that dealing with collec-tive agreements) normally fall in this country within the responsibility of theemployers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations concerned. . In general, however, the two recommendations are consistent with our industrial relations policy, and, as such,we should be able to accept at least the greater part of them. A first discussion alsotook place on an item dealing with the question of co-operation between public authorities and employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations. In the time available, theConference was only able to deal with that part of the item concerned with co-opera-tion at the level of the undertaking, and it adopted general conclusions on this sub-ject with a view to the adoption of a Recommendation. These conclusions providefor the encouragement of, or the establishment by legislation of, machinery for consultation and co-operation between employers and workers at the level of theundertaking on matters of mutual concern not within the scope of collective bargain-ing machinery. The Conference also decided to ask the Governing Body to arrangefor the preparation, with a view to a first discussion next year, of draft conclusionscontaining, as model guiding principles, examples of good practice concerningconsultation and co-operation at the level of the undertaking. The remainder ofthis item, namely, co-operation at the level of the industry and at the national level,will similarly be placed on the Agenda of the next session for first discussion.Social Security27. A first discussion took place on an item entitled &quot; Objectives and minimum standards of Social Security.&quot; Social Security Conventions hitherto adopted by theI.L.O. deal with individual branches of social security. The regulations now pro-posed, however, are designed to promote standards covering social security schemes
Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,30th July, 1951.as a whole. There was not sufficient time available to discuss this item in its entiretyand it was decided to postpone consideration of the &quot; Objectives and advancedstandards of social security &quot; until next year&apos;s Conference. Conclusions were, how-ever, reached in regard to a proposed Convention on minimum standards, and these will form the basis of further consultation with Governments with a view to asecond discussion next year. The conclusions list the main branches of social security, and the requirements to be satisfied in respect of each of these branches.States Members would be entitled to ratify the Convention in respect of the branches of social security in which their schemes fulfilled the prescribed require-ments, provided that these requirements were satisfied in respect of at least threebranches.A. R.
Address to the Conference by the Minister of labour I am very indebted to you, Mr. President, for the very nice tribute you have paid to my country and to the office which I now hold. I agree with you entirely,of course, that it is a particularly difficult and rather onerous one, but in thesematters, if we believe in the things for which we have worked all our lives and go forward with courage and honesty and sincerity, then if we fail after that to achieve our objective, at least we have the satisfaction of knowing that we havedone best according to our ability. I therefore endeavour to bring these fewthings to my present task as Minister of Labour and National Service in GreatBritain, in the hope that in the months that lie ahead, difficult though our problemsmay be, we shall, by our traditional method of conciliation and voluntary agree-ment, maintain industrial peace, build up our British economy, and help the economy of other nations and the peace of the world.It was my intention to devote my speech to matters contained in the Reportof the Director-General but, in view of the speech made by the Persian government delegates, it is essential that I should make a short reply in order to place the facts of the situation before this international Conference. I think it is a matter forgreat regret that he has brought before this Conference questions concerning theAnglo-Iranian Oil Company and the policy of nationalising the oil industry in persia, which are not within the competence of the International Labour Organisa-tion and which therefore cannot properly be debated here. Since, however, the delegate from Persia has improperly raised this question, I feel it my duty to say justtwo things.The first concerns the right to nationalise this great industry and the appealmade to the International Court of Justice at The Hague by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom. The term &quot; nationalisation,&quot; in the opinion of my government and we know something about nationalisation in Great Britain undera Labour Government has been consistently misused by Persian spokesmen.Persian oil is already in the ownership of the Persian State and people. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company has been operating in Persia under the security of a regularlynegotiated agreement valid until 1993, and relying upon that agreement theCompany has invested greater sums than ever invested in a foreign country by any single company. My Government neither desire nor intend to question the exer-cise of any sovereign rights which Persia may legitimately exercise. They domaintain, however, that the action now proposed against the Company is not a legitimate exercise of those rights. The 1933 agreement is a contract, a contract between the Persian Government and a foreign Company concluded under the auspices of the League of Nations. It was moreover ratified by the Majlis and became Persian law.The agreement contains two very important provisions. First, under Article 21,the position of the Company under its agreement shall not be altered by action ofthe Persian Government or by Persian legislation except as a result of an agreementbetween the Company and the Persian Government. Secondly, under Article 22,if the Persian Government had any complaint against the Company, or vice versa,and the dispute could not be settled otherwise, it was to be referred to arbitration,the tribunal being presided over by an umpire who would be appointed by thearbitrators themselves or, in default of their agreement, by the President of theInternational Court of Justice at The Hague.The essential point is not the right of a sovereign Power by its legislation to nationalise commercial enterprises carried on within its borders, nor what is themeasure of compensation it should pay for doing so: the essential point is that thePersian Government, in effect, undertook not to exercise this right and the realissue is, therefore, the wrong done if a sovereign State breaks a contract which it hasdeliberately made. If...the Persian Government had any grievances against theCompany, it should have sought arbitration.My second observation concerns the accusations which have been so freelymade against the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Similar implications are containedin the speech made to this Conference by the Persian Government delegate. It isnecessary for me to dispel the unfortunate impression that may have been created by his associating the poverty in Persia, which we all deplore, with the activities ofthe Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.
What are the facts? What benefits have Persia and the Persian people derivedfrom the operations of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company? First, there have beenthe enormous benefits which have accrued to the Persian Government by way ofroyalties and tax payments, and secondly, the development of a great industryin an otherwise barren territory.In 1911, Abadan was a tiny village in an arid desert region. To-dav, it is the site of the largest oil refinery in the world, employing some 40,000 Persian workers and staff, with a 200,000 population, with schools, a technical institute, hospitals,clinics and welfare centres, large modern housing estates, cinemas, swimming poolsand playing fields.In addition, the Company provides. employment for another 30,000 Persiansin its oil-fields and other operations. The Company has built over 21,000 houses for its employees. It has built hospitals, dispensaries and clinics catering for some300,000 persons, and recently provided a 100-bed extension to the Shahabad Sana-sanatorium near Tehran, together with funds for its maintenance. Over 20,000 childrenattend the schools which the Company has provided. In addition, of course,there is an extensive system of roads, bridges and ferries, all adding to the capitalassets of Persia.The Company has a record of which any employer might be proud. This is fully borne out by the report of the impartial mission, published in October 1950by the International Labour Office for all the world to see.The facts speak for themselves. I shall say no more on this subject but will proceed to deal with the Director-GeneraFs Report.My very first duty and a pleasant one at that is to join with other speakersin saying how very glad we are to see the Director-General back in his accustomedplace at this year&apos;s Conference. We all know how unsparingly he has devotedhimself to the interests of the Organisation. We are delighted to see him restored to health, and wish him all success and good fortune in the heavy tasks whichconfront him.May I next express the pleasure of my Government on the admission of theFederal Republic of Germany to membership of this Organisation. We iookforward to co-operating fruitfully with the German people in pursuit of the aims of the International Labour Organisation. I hope that the admission of germany will be followed possibly within the next few hours by a decision to admit Japanalso to this fellowship.We are very happy, too, to see a delegation from Yugoslavia present again at this year&apos;s Conference.Although I have not previously had the pleasure of attending a session of theInternational Labour Conference, I have followed the work of the organisation for very many years with the deepest interest. The General Secretary of my Union,Sir Joseph Hallsworth, was for many years, as many of you know, a prominentfigure at this Conference and so great was his interest in the I.L.O. that he neverfailed to keep us fully informed of all its activities. I am therefore particularlypleased to have this opportunity of contributing something to your discussions,and of pledging once more the full and continuing support of the United KingdomGovernment to the work of the I.L.O.In view of the keen interest which the Conference always takes in conditionsin non-metropolitan countries, I should like to devote a little time to the non-self-governing territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible.Surveying the scene from the point of view of the Director-GeneraFs Report,it is of course true, as the Director-General has pointed out, that the basic problems in most of our territories are those arising from an underdeveloped economy. Theproblems of inflation and productivity in conditions of full employment, with whichthe more highly developed countries are so vitally concerned to-day, affect these territories only as a complicating cross-current. Many of them are large exportersof primary products, the world demand and the world price for which have steadilyrisen in the past few years. This development has, of course, provided a verywelcome increase in the resources available for the economic and social developmentof the territories and is assisting us in expanding their economies and improving their standards of living. I think the United Kingdom may justly claim to have played a substantial part in this work of helping the underdeveloped countries onthe road of progress.Many important development schemes are now in operation, particularly inthe agricultural field. These may bring with them substantial and rapid changesin the pattern of life, and the whole process of development must be based upon
the understanding, initiative and willing co-operation of the people themselves. Inall this, the progressive establishment of sound policies in the labour field is of thefirst importance. Throughout our territories, labour legislation is being improved and extended with full regard to the principles and the standards contained in the conventions adopted by this Conference. Increasing attention is being paid to theproblems of technical training and productivity in relation to economic development;and on the social side much of the recent legislation in our territories is concernedwith wage-fixing machinery and workmen&apos;s compensation. Every encouragement and guidance is being given to the development of workers&apos; and employers&apos;organisations and of effective systems of industrial relations; and the administra-tions are being strengthened to undertake the increased work relating to labouraffairs.At this point I regret that I must refer briefly to certain remarks made earlier in this discussion by Mr. Gemmill, the Employers&apos; delegate from South Africa,about the emigration of labour from Nyasaland. Mr. Gemmill, in effect, iscomplaining of&quot; the reduction in the quota of workers which his Association is permitted to recruit in Nyasaland. Again, this is not in my view a matter whichis appropriate for debate here, and I do not propose to reply to Mr. Gemmill inany detail, but there are three observations which I must make quite shortly.It is true that the Government of Nyasaland has reduced this year the quota of workers whom Mr. GemmilFs Association may be permitted to recruit. Butthe number actually recruited last year was substantially below the prescribedquota and on very few occasions in past years has the full quota been taken up.In the second place, the fixing of the quota is-entirely within the discretion of the Nyasaland Government, and, before granting permission to recruit, theGovernment is fully entitled, and indeed obliged, under Article 5 of ConventionNo. 50, to consider &quot; the possible effects of the withdrawal of adult males on thesocial organisation of the population concerned &quot; and in particular upon theirfamily life, health, welfare and development. It is on these grounds that the nyasaland Government has reduced the quota.Thirdly, the comparison which Mr. Gemmill attempted to draw between thewages a worker might earn in employment in Nyasaland and in employmentoutside is, in my view, quite irrelevant and indeed invalid, since it involves comparingagricultural wages in one territory with industrial wages in a completely differentterritory.There I propose to leave the matter.Last year the Conference concentrated much attention on the problem ofmaintaining a high level of employment throughout the world, and the UnitedKingdom Government were particularly glad to co-operate in framing, and to vote in favour of, the resolution which the Conference finally adopted. TheConference will also remember that, last summer, the Economic and Social Councilof the United Nations recommended Governments to announce as soon as possiblethe standard by which they defined the meaning of full employment as a continuingobjective of policy. My Government, as you may know,&quot; have decided to express the full employment standard of the United Kingdom as a level of unemploymentof 3 per cent, at the seasonal peak. The choice of this standard does not mean that the Government will allow unemployment to reach 3 per cent, before takingvigorous counteraction. On the contrary, it will be a continuing objective of theGovernment^ policy to counter any unfavourable trends in employment, to keepunemployment at the lowest possible level and to take special measures to dealwith those areas in which unemployment has persisted at a comparativelyhigh level. ,I am very glad that the Director-General has, in his Report this year, continued the practice of concentrating attention on a particular issue of current concern, andthat he has selected a subject so closely related to your discussions last year;namely, wages policy in conditions of full employment, with particular referenceto the dangers of inflation. I am perfectly sure that the Conference will agree thatthe section of his Report on this subject is of the greatest interest and value. Wein the United Kingdom believe that here is one of the fundamental economic problems of the modern world. Each country must solve the problem in. its own way in the light of its own historical development and of its traditional means ofdealing with social and economic questions; but we believe that our experience in the United Kingdom of this subject is of some value in showings how we have met. the dangers of inflation which are to be feared in a society in.which full employment has been secured. .
The dangers of inflation since the war have been very great. In order to meet this situation, the United Kingdom Government has adopted financial policiesdesigned to secure a proper balance between domestic purchasing power and theavailable supply of goods. We have maintained in the United Kingdom a high level of taxation, one result of which has been that each year since 1947-48 wehave had a very substantial budget surplus. We have encouraged personal savings,and we have restricted capita! investment.These measures have done much to prevent the development of inflationary pressure. But, with the general scarcity of labour and the sellers&apos; market of thepost-war period, the dangers of wage inflation still, of course, remain. Accordingly,our policy has been directed towards the stabilisation of incomes and prices.So far as wages are concerned, it would have been possible to establish some form of direct wages control, but we rejected this because it would have been quitecontrary to the principle of responsible self-government in industry which is thefundamental basis of our policy of industrial relations.Our view is that the determination of wages and conditions should be left tothe two sides of industry, so that the people in each industry who really knowits conditions and understand its problems have the responsibility of determiningits wage structure and modifying it from time to time in accordance with the needsof the economic and social situation. Accordingly, we have relied and with great success on the sense of responsibility of the leaders of employers&apos; and workers&apos;organisations in industry, and on their voluntary co-operation with the Governmentin broad objectives of economic policy to avoid the dangers of inflation. TheDirector-General refers in his Report to the development of a greater sense ofresponsibility among trade unions. We think it is equally important, particularlyin a situation of full employment, that an equal sense of responsibility should be developed among the employers.It is a matter of pride to us in the United Kingdom that our voluntary collective bargaining system has been so firmly established and the sense of responsibility ofemployers and work peopled representatives developed to such an extent that evenduring the war it was not necessary for the Government to exercise any direct control over wages.In order that this policy of relying on voluntary restraint should be successful,we have kept industry regularly and fully informed of the true economic situation of the country through the machinery of the National Joint Advisory Council,which represents the British Employers&apos; Confederation, the Trades Union Con-gress and the nationalised industries, and is presided over by the Minister of Labourand National Service. In addition, we have adopted since the war the practiceof publishing annual economic surveys which examine in great detail the economicsituation of the country. In the light of these surveys, of statements by theMinisters concerned with economic questions, and other sources of economic information, the responsible trade union and employers&apos; leaders have been able to guide their members with a knowledge of the true facts of the position.The Director-General in his Report draws attention to the fact that early in1948 the United Kingdom Government published a White Paper on personal incomes, Costs and Prices. This White Paper made clear that the national situation required stability in costs, prices and personal incomes, including profits,rents, salaries and wages, and called upon the whole community to co-operate in maintaining this stability.The response of the trade unions and the employers was remarkable and the degree of support obtained by voluntary means for this policy was most impressive.There was general acceptance in industry of the Governments recommendations and for a period of 18 months from April 1949 there was almost complete stability of wages.So far as prices are concerned we have, by Government action, since the early part of the war kept the prices of many consumer goods steady, partly throughprice control and partly by Government subsidies. In the case of basic food-stuffs,prices to the consumer have been kept down by Government subsidies, generallyat levels below the purchase prices. The value of these subsidies amounts atpresent to no less than  410 million a year approximately three shillings per weekper person.These measures taken together have prevented a runaway rise in the price ofnecessities. For the first two years of the war prices went up, but when the pricecontrols and subsidies had become effective the cost of living remained steadyfor the rest of the war period and throughout the transition period after the end
of-the war. Prices began, however, to rise again in the latter half of 1947 and inthe following year were rising more rapidly than wage rates. It must not, however,be assumed that the real income of the workers was falling. As has been pointedOut by the Director-General, and also emphasised by the Belgian Workers&apos; delegateyesterday, where productivity is rising there is scope for increases in earnings whichare non-inflationary in character, and during this same period the earnings of theworkers as distinct from wages were increasing considerably, largely due to theoperation of systems of wage payment related to output under which workers werereaping the reward of additional effort.Therefore, a substantial increase in real earnings was obtained while, at thesame time, stability in wage rates was obtained which avoided dangers of inflation.All this was due to the voluntary co-operation of both sides of industry and was achieved during a period when there was remarkably little unrest, as is reflected indays lost in industrial stoppages.So far, I have referred mainly to the situation as it had developed up to the summer of last year. Since then, the situation has changed again. following the world-wide increases in the prices of food-stuffs and raw materials, wage claimsagain began to be pressed and for the last six or nine months a round of wage increases has taken place affecting more or less the whole of industry. As is recognised in the Director-general&apos;s Report, wage increases which do not exceed the improvement in productivity are not inflationary in character. industrial production in the United Kingdom rose 40 per cent, between 1946 and 1950, andover the last three years productivity has shown an average annual improvementof 7 per cent.We are again facing a potentially inflationary situation, which can only be averted by increased productivity. We are confident that the necessary increase in productivity can be secured. There are, of course, two conditions which areabsolutely essential there must be a sufficient supply of raw materials and theworkers must have confidence in the continuance of full employment. If theseconditions are fulfilled, my Government believe that increased productivity will beachieved and the danger of inflation avoided.I hope 1 have shown the general success of the methods which we have adoptedin the United Kingdom since the war in maintaining freedom of negotiation on wages questions. This policy is very much in accordance, with the recommendations which have been made by the Director-General in his Report. There is one point which he mentions, however, on which I should like to comment. While we would agree that wage increases should not as a whole exceed the general increases in productivity in the country concerned, since otherwise they tend to be inflationaryin character, it does, not follow that in all circumstances wage increases should beproportionate to the increase in productivity. It may weil be that some part of the increases in productivity should be devoted to reducing prices, which increases thereal wages of wage earners but benefits aiso those elements of the community, suchas retired persons, whose incomes tend to be more rigid and less easily altered thanthose of the wage earners in industry. Furthermore, as the Swedish Employers&apos;delegate indicated on Tuesday, we cannot deal with the adjustment of wages inrelation to productivity on a theoretical basis as great practical difficulties are involved. These matters can only be settled on a practical basis of negotiation between employers and workpeople.While, however, I have felt it necessary to make this one point, I want to saythat we are in general agreement with the conclusions of the Director-General, andI am sure that his analysis and the views he expresses have been extremely helpful in providing the basis for a most interesting and valuable debate. I should like to conclude this part of my remarks by thanking the Director-General and his staff for the thorough study which they have put before us.I conclude as I began by pledging the full support of the United KingdomGovernment to the work of this Organisation.An international organisation can only live by virtue of the support which itreceives from its members. Such support can take many forms, but, in many ways,the most important responsibility lies with those who are actually engaged in theday-to-day work of the Organisation. So far as the I.L.O. is concerned, there have always been outstanding personalities from all countries and from all groups, whohave left their own peculiar mark upon the Organisation^ development, but I wouldlike to stress the importance of the contribution made by those countless others Conference delegates, Governing Body Members, Committee representatives, and experts, of all kinds -who, together with the rank and file of the International
Labour Office, bear the burden of our work from day to day and from year to year.It is upon them that we must ultimately depend for the successful accomplishmentof our work. The present is a particularly testing time for international organisa-tions. I have no doubt that there is an increasing scope for international action,particularly in the social and labour field in which we are engaged. This constitutes a challenge which, I am sure, will be met with that energy and that generous spiritwhich have always been so characteristic of the I.L.O. But the ever-deeperiing com-complexity of international work also demands of us other qualities. international action is a technique which must be learnt with patience and applied with wisdom,and, above all, with complete integrity if it is to be fully effective. We must alwaysconsider the end which is to be achieved and plan our action, whether national orinternational, in the way best calculated to serve that end. The qualities to whichI have referred need to be applied not only within each international organisation,but over the whole field of international activity. We hear proposals for action bythis or that organisation, or even for the establishment of new organisations, wherethe sponsors do not always appear to speak with the same voice as their nationalcolleagues in other international organisations, and may, indeed, not always be fully aware of what is being done elsewhere. A system of unco-ordinated competi-tion in the international field is wasteful and inefficient, and, as the UruguayanGovernment delegate said yesterday, a proper co-ordination of effort is essential.Within that framework, each organisation should, not only in theory, but also inpractice, retain full discretion in regard to the framing of its programme and the priorities falling within that programme. This is a matter of particular moment toa tripartite organisation like the I.L.O., and that is the reason why I stress its importance here today.It is by co-operation and not by competition, by singleness of purpose, by faith in our aims, by devotion to our cause, that we shall fulfil the trust that has been laid upon us. If we labour in that spirit we may indeed look to the future with complete confidence.
