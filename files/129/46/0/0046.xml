[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL /31CP.(51) 196 COPY NO.7TH JULY, 1951CABINETTIED COTTAGESMemorandum by the Minister of Local Government and planning and the Minister of Agriculture and FisheriesWe propose to our colleagues that a public undertaking shouldbe given to introduce legislation to repeal Sub-Section g(ii) of the first schedule of the Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions (Amendment)Act, 1933.    The relevant Sub-Section of the Schedule is in an appendix to this paper.    We do not propose that such a Bill should be introducedthis session, but we recommend that it should be included in next session&apos;s programme.2. The reason for this proposal is as follows.    The Sub-Sectionproposed to be repealed provides special facilities for farmers tocreate new tied houses.    They buy houses, the tenants of which areprotected under the Rent Restrictions Act, and the Sub-Section thenenables the new owners, with the consent of the Courts, to evict the tenants without providing alternative accommodation.    This trans-formation of a controlled house into a tied house is operated through asystem of &quot;cottage certificates&quot; which are now being granted at the rateof about a thousand a-year.    The certificates are granted by panelsconsisting of one representative of the farmers and one of the farmworkers with an independent chairman.    This means that there is a steady increase in the total number of farmers&apos; tied houses and in most cases these are not isolated houses on a remote farm, where the case for retaining tied cottages is strongest, but houses in villages, oftenmiles away from the farm.    Whatever may be said about the tiedcottage problem generally, on which it has been made clear that theGovernment cannot legislate in this Parliament, this increase in thenumber of tied houses is open to serious objection and is, not unnaturally,causing great complaint among agricultural workers.3. We have both been subjected to representations through theNational Executive of the Labour Party as well as through Parliament,and we have discussed the question with Mr. E.G. Gooch, M.P., andMr. A.E. Tiffin as representing the National Union of agricultural workers (N.U.A.W.) and the Transport and General Workers1 Union.We told them that we would be willing to recommend to our colleagues the repeal of the above-mentioned Sub-Section and they both expressedthemselves highly gratified.    The original proposal of the N.U.A.W.,in a communication to the National Executive Committee, was that&quot;there should be a Bill which would temporarily hold up the issuing ofany further certificates.....until a new Rent Act is introduced, whichwould deal with all the major problems, including the position of thetied cottage&quot;.    Our proposal, therefore, goes somewhat beyond thesuggestion of the N.U.A.W. and is both simpler and more easilyjustified.
4. Before making this recommendation, we carefully considered whether we could suspend the issue of further certificates by admini-strative direction, but we were advised that this was legally impossible.5. We made it clear to Mr. Gooch and Mr. Tiffin that a Bill onthese lines would not affect the existing law whereby (a) the occupier of a rent-free tied cottage can be turned out without notice or anyCourt Order, and his goods placed upon the roadside, nor (b) wherebyan occupier can be turned out of a cottage, for which he pays rent,under a Court Order, if he leaves his employment with the owner.These provisions apply, of course, not only to agricultural workers,but to a large number of others.    Mr. Gooch and Mr. Tiffin clearly understood that, in these respects, the law will remain unchanged until such time as we are able to bring in comprehensive amending legisla-tion.    None the less, it is our firm opinion that the small amendment -which we suggest would both be justifiable in itself and would do some-thing to sweeten the rather foul atmosphere which has developed in parts of the countryside on the subject of the tied cottage, in view ofthe fact that, during our six years of power, the present Governmenthave so far taken no steps to deal with this, in spite of much pressure from our supporters in the countryside and the passage of severalresolutions on the subject at our Annual Conferences.6. We ask our colleagues to agree to the proposal in the first paragraph.H.D.T.W.7TH JULY. 1951.
