-    32/ililS  DOCUMENT  IS THE  PROPERTY   OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. July 1951SECRET Copy No.   31CP. (51) 21720th July, 1951CABINETSERVICE WORKS PROGRAMME: PROVISION OF staff memorandum by the Minister of defence i must ask my colleagues to consider as a matter of urgency the measureswhich are necessary to reinforce the works (including lands) staffs of the service departments if we are to avoid a serious breakdown in the Service works programme.2. The size of the task with which the Service Departments are faced isshown by the following figures:  The works programme for new works and maintenance for the three Servicesand the Ministry of Supply (defence works) for 1950 totalled  52 - 2 million, includingadditions made in the course of the year.Under the latest programme approved by the Cabinet (the  4,700 millionprogramme), the figures will be  96-0 million for 1951,  116-9 million for 1952and  106-7 million for 1953.Details are given in Appendix A.3. At the time the  3,600 million programme was launched the Service worksdirectorates were already under strength, and it is clear that, however much work is entrusted to outside agencies, such as firms of surveyors and more recently firmsof consulting engineers and architects, the work involved in a programme of the size now approved by way of initial planning, survey and preparation of schemes,placing of contracts and supervision of work on the site must involve majorincreases in staff in the works directorates themselves. In actual fact the strengthof the works staff, professional and technical (including draughtsmen) employedby the three Service Departments, has, during the last year, increased only from,651 to 5,024.*4. I drew the attention of the Defence Committee to this problem last Octoberin D.O. (50) 87. The Committee then invited the Minister of Labour to arrange fora complete examination of the problem and to make recommendations to theCabinet. In January, in the report appended to CP. (51) 16, which led to the acceleration of the programme, the Chiefs of Staff drew attention to the fact thatthe Service works programme were already subject to severe limitations arising fromshortages of staff and that in the absence of special steps the accelerated programmed could not be achieved. In CP. (51) 36 the Prime Minister gave certain specificinstructions designed to crystallise the problem and to secure reinforcement for theService Departments. In fact the reinforcement of the works staff of the service departments which has occurred since January is negligible; and we are now facedwith a definite prospect of a serious short-fall in the programme with resultantunder-spending of the Works Votes.* In the absence of any control of engagements, individuals are free to leave the employment ofthe Serxrjce Departments to undertake other employment the present rates of annual wastage areof the order of 8 per cent, for professionals, 6 per cent, for technicals and 11 per cent, for draughts-men. Furthermore, a high proportion of the candidates who are actually offered appointmentdecline; this percentage, in the case of the Air Ministry, is 45 per cent, for professionals, 25 per cent,for technicals and 20 per cent, for draughtsmen.40936 b
5. The Ministry of Works also has a very heavy programme of work for defence. The major item is the building work required by the Ministry of supply in connection with research projects. A considerable amount of work is done forthe Service Departments and there are also substantial programmes to be carriedout on behalf of the Home office, Ministry of Food, Board of Trade and otherDepartments in connection with defence requirements. In this paper I have, how-ever, confined myself to the problem as it affects the Service Departments themselves.6. Within the Service works programme, special priority is, of course, being given to certain projects, for example, the Control and Reporting chain. But outsidethese special projects the programme is slipping steadily backwards. This is inevitable in the absence of effective measures to provide additional staff. Outsideagencies are being employed wherever possible, but it must be realised they toorequire guidance and supervision.Delay is occurring all along the line except for the limited number of projects which have been given over-riding priority. Thus, in the case of the Admiralty, oil fuel storage is suffering; in the case of the Army, the storage depots for new equip-ment now in production are being delayed; and in the case of the R.A.F. delays areoccurring in the development of the Flying Training Organisation, in effectingimprovements at Technical Training schools and in rehabilitating air fields for use by U.S.A.F. fighter squadrons.7. The Service Departments have notified their requirements for additional staff to the Treasury and the Ministry of Labour is also aware of their nature. they now amount to more than 1,500 and no serious question has arisen as to the size ofthis demand. A detailed break down by categories is given in Appendix B. TheService Departments are fully satisfied that the projects included in their worksprogrammes are essential: that constant and proper regard is paid to relativepriorities within the programme: that the maximum practicable use is being madeof outside agencies: and that the allocation of staff by grades and categories can bejustified in relation to the programme which the Cabinet have approved.8. I deal in Appendix C with certain suggestions which have been made atthe Production Committee and elsewhere. In my view none of these measures will produce substantial or early contributions towards producing the staff required.I must therefore ask my colleagues to give urgent consideration to the measureslisted below:  (a) Secondment of staff from Civil to Service DepartmentsDepartments engaged on civil work should be called upon to make availablefor immediate secondment to those engaged on defence work percentages of theirexisting staff for periods not exceeding 3 years. Such percentages should bedetermined by the Treasury and should, of course, take into account inter alia therecent cuts made in the Capital Investment Programme. Further recruitment by departments of staff for civil work should be suspended for a minimum period of six months. These are necessary measures of immediate assistance. They willnot remove the need for further economies in staffs employed on civil work if anysuch economies can be produced, for example, by the independent investigation of the employment of works staff on non-defence work proposed by the Chancellorof the Exchequer in paragraph 10 of CP. (51) 182.(b) Revision of conditions of service of permanent staffAlthough as regards remuneration it is unlikely that the Service departments will ever be in a position to compete in the open market on a basis of equality with private firms, it is essential that the conditions of service for permanent staff shouldbe revised, and revised conditions published as rapidly as possible. In September1948, the Chorley Committee recommended that the salaries of the professionalclasses, in the Works Group should be examined as a matter of urgency, as they felt that many of the posts required &quot; relative &quot; increases in salary as well as suchimprovements as were &quot; consequential &quot; on the increases proposed for the Admini-strative Group, since in their view salaries in the Works Group had not kept pace with the greatly increased volume, complexity and importance of the work required from senior officers in it. In October last a small number of the higher grades ofthe Works Group comparable with the Chorley grades of the Administrative Classreceived &quot; consequential &quot; increases in salary, but no increases at all have yet beenapproved for the lower professional grades, into which we need to recruit, notwith-standing the increases since approved for the Executive grades in the same salaryranges.
Salaries for the Group as a whole have been under examination since July1950, by the Gardiner Committee, and it is understood that whatever rates are approved as a result of their report should be back-dated to 1st January, 1951.This does not, however, help as regards recruitment, and it is necessary that theCommittee should complete their task and that revised salary scales should bepromulgated as rapidly as possible. If some further delay is unavoidable, then an interim award should be made by the Treasury and promulgated.Minor improvements have recently been approved and promulgated for technical staff, including draughtsmen, but I doubt whether these improvementsrepresent the last word and I consider that these rates should be reviewed as soonas decisions are available in the professional classes. We shall in due course need to review the question of whether a bonus should be payable to staff liable for over-seas service but it may be more appropriate to consider this in connection with theGardiner Committee report. Liability to overseas service is of course a considerablerecruiting disability to the Service Departments.It is said that the shortage of works staff will not be remedied by increases in pay alone. That is no doubt correct. It is, however, equally true that unless pay is settled satisfactorily all the other methods which may be tried will fail. Further-more, improved conditions of service help to stop wastage which (as will be seen from the footnote to paragraph 3) is running at a high level.(c) Secondment from Local AuthoritiesThere should be initiated a scheme under which local authorities should be encouraged to lend or second staff for duty with the Service Departments.Individuals seconded under this scheme should retain their existing superannuationrights. The scheme would be best introduced by a public statement by the PrimeMinister preparatory to more detailed appeals by the Service Ministers.(d) Further courses of actionIt should be recognised that the measures in sub-paragraphs (a) (c) above,although essential, will not provide the staff immediately required. To meet the deficit it will be necessary to adopt one of two alternatives.Either (i) there should be special inducements for temporary staff. TheTreasury have recently agreed that a special lodging allowance may bepaid in certain circumstances to candidates accepting appointmentsunder the Service Departments who have to work away from their homes. This will be valuable, but if we are to follow the course ofinducement I am sure that we must now also consider the payment ofspecial bounties to temporary staff entering from outside the public ser-vice either at the end of each year of service or on completion of a con-contractual period. The Treasury have so far been unwilling to agreeto these bounties, on the ground that they will cause difficulties. Nodoubt they will, but I would remind my colleagues that we were forcedto adopt a bounty scheme in the Services during the years immediatelyafter the war when requirements could be met in no other way. Unlessthe alternative in sub-paragraph (ii) below is preferred, somethingsimilar is now required in the Works Group.Or, (ii) approval should be given for a scheme of hire of staff from private firms. This method has already been resorted to for special jobs, andalthough it involves the payment of overheads to firms, extendedapplication of this method of obtaining essential staff is the only alter-native to sub-paragraph (i).The Service Departments have no particular preference between (i) and (ii).In the last resort the adoption of both may prove inevitable.9. I am convinced that no useful purpose would be served by remitting thesubstance of these proposals for further examination. The ground has been covered again and again by the examinations which have been undertaken by the manpower Committee and other bodies since last October. What is required aredecisions at Ministerial level and effective action to ensure that there is no break-down in the programme.   Details can be discussed at departmental level.10.   I therefore invite the Cabinet to agree in principle to:  (i) a scheme of secondment of staff, in proportions to be decided, from Civilto Service Departments (paragraph 8 (a));40936 b 2
(ii) a suspension of recruitment by Departments of staff for civil work (para-graph 8 (a));(iii) an interim award on salary scaies and early determination of the finalaward which will presumably result from the Gardiner committee report (paragraph 8 (b));(iv) the introduction of a scheme of secondment from local authority service to Service Departments (paragraph 8 (c));and either(v) the payment of special bounties to temporary staff entering from outsidethe public service (paragraph 8 (d) (i));or(vi) the extended use of staff hired from private firms at a premium over salary(paragraph 8 (d) (ii)).Ministry of Defence, S.W. 1,20th July, 1951.

II. Deficiencies at Peak of Programme. Service departments the excess of estimated staff requirements at their peak over present strengths are Professional Technical (includingDrawing Office)Admiralty       ............ 121 258War Office     ............ 253 1,037Air Ministry   ............ 288 .708662 2,003Total    ............ 2,665Notes. (i) The Admiralty Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Staff covers other services in addition to works. There are deficiencies in the total complement in thesegrades.(ii) Admiralty and Air Ministry have no requirement for Maintenance Surveyors.(iii) Figures include United Kingdom-based Staff serving overseas but not locally enteredemployees abroad.APPENDIX CNote on certain suggestions in regard to technical manpower made at themeeting of the Production Committee on 29th May and of other factorsaffecting the problem.Conclusion 1More effective use should be made of technical staff called up under theNational Service Acts.Arrangements already exist for making the fullest practicable use of technical qualifications possessed by National Service men. The extent to which draughts-men can be used in drawing offices is of course limited by their youth andinexperience, but in the Air Ministry Drawing Office some twenty-eight vacanciesare at present filled by National Service men and this number will be increased ifexperience shows that to be practicable.Conclusion 2The Headquarters Building Committee should examine the more effective useof technical staff already in post by re-arrangement of priorities and reviewof technical standards.A meeting has already been held to consider this suggestion. But it cannot besupposed even on the most optimistic view that a major saving of staff can beexpected to result.  As far as the Service Departments are concerned it must beremembered:(a) that priorities have been carefully considered in order to enable depart-ments to concentrate on first things first. Numerous projects havebeen postponed or deleted but any suggestion that the domestic building programmes should be postponed would not be acceptable;(b) that technical standards have already been reduced as far as possible;(c) that all Departments already economise on technical staff by reducingchecking work to a minimum but complete elimination of this type ofwork is not practicable.Conclusion 3Investigation of the use to be made of local authorities for agency work.The scope for using the design staff of local authorities on defence is very limited and the Service Departments would much prefer a scheme under which thelocal authorities lent their staff to the Service Departments. Any scheme for agencywork which would discourage local authorities from releasing staff on loan wouldbe disadvantageous. The suggestion for using local authorities for agency workmay, however, be no more than academic since we understand that the Ministry ofLocal Government and-Planning feel that local authorities in general possess only such building powers as are given them by statute and have not themselves powerto accept work on agency from Government Departments.
Conclusion 4A review by the Ministry of Labour of the distribution and employment of technical manpower.This is welcomed but Service Departments doubt whether any opportunityarises in this connection for a substantial contribution to be made to this problem:it is clear from paragraph 18 of E.S. (51) 36 that there is no reservoir of unemployedstaff in these grades but rather that the tendency of demand to exceed supply is growing fast. In these circumstances the problem is substantially one of obtain-ing for defence work staff who are already usefully employed and it is this problemthat is discussed in the covering paper to this Appendix.The Employment of Retired Officers with Technical QualificationsAction is being taken in this field but in relation to the staff problem underconsideration no major result can be expected. There are only fifty ex-regular officers on the Ministry of Labour Technical and Scientific Register.Local Authorities Shelter programme the announcement on 28th June (Hansard Col. 163.4) indicates that it is forthe most part unnecessary for works staff to be retained for this type of planningbut that the number of staff likely to be thrown up is very small.
