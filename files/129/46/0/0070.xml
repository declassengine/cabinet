(51) 22023rd July, 1951CABINETRATIFICATION OF THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS, 1949Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs andthe Home secretary i. Development since the Meeting of Ministers held on 2nd December, 1949At a meeting of Ministers held under the chairmanship of the Prime minister on 2nd December, 1949 (GEN. 281 Third Meeting) it was agreed that the fourGeneva Conventions for the Protection of War Victims should be signed on behalfof His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, subject to a reservationrelating to the imposition of the death penalty in occupied territory for certain specified crimes (Article 68 (2) of the Civilian Convention).2. The Conventions were accordingly signed on 8th December, 1949, byPlenipotentiaries of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of twenty-seven other Govern-ments. The position to-day is that, of the sixty-four States which participated inthe Conference, sixty-one have signed the Conventions. The following States have since ratified the Conventions:  Chile, Czechoslovakia, Holy See, India, Jordan, Lebanon, Liechtenstein,Monaco, Pakistan, Philippines, Switzerland and Yugoslavia.3. A number of countries made reservations at the time of signature of the conventions. While some of these reservations are open to serious objection, itis not believed that any of them need prevent the ratification of the Conventionsby the United Kingdom. Enquiries ^re being made of the Governments concerned to elucidate the meaning of some of these reservations, and the question whether any formal objection will have to be made at the time of the deposit of the UnitedKingdom ratification can be decided later, in consultation with other interested governments.4. The position in regard to the more objectionable of the reservations madeby other Powers is explained in Annex B of this paper.II. Intentions of other Countries regarding Ratification of the Geneva Conventions5. The French Parliament has approved the four Conventions unanimously,and French ratification is expected at any moment. The Danish, Netherlands and norwegian Governments expect to be in a position to ratify during the presentyear. Ratification by Czechoslovakia (see preceding paragraph) would certainly not have taken place without the assent of the &quot;Soviet Government and may portendratification by the U.S.S.R. and other East European States. Judging from enquiriesreceived at the Foreign Office, it seems likely that other West European States arewaiting for a lead from the United Kingdom. As regards the United States, HisMajesty&apos;s Embassy in Washington reports that the Conventions have now beensubmitted to the Senate for approval. Once the Senate&apos;s approval has beenobtained, it is probable that the United States Government will be prepared to ratify the Conventions without waiting for any legislation which may be required to implement their provisions in the United States.40941 B
III. Need for Prompt Ratification of the Conventions by the United Kingdom6. There can be no doubt that the new Conventions represent, on balance,a great improvement on those concluded in 1929. The deficiencies of the old Con-ventions which were brought to light during the world war have, to a great extent,been made good; prisoners of war will receive a greater degree of protection; themeasures for the care of the sick and wounded have been perfected; and a newcharter has been drawn up for the protection of civilians who hitherto have been most inadequately protected against the type of treatment meted out to them in occupied territory.7. In the view of the Service Departments, it is important that the Conventions and, in particular, the Prisoner-of-War Convention should be ratified both bythe United Kingdom and the U.S.S.R. at an early date. The U.S.S.R., although a party to the 1929 Wounded and Sick Convention, has not ratified the 1929Prisoner-of-War Convention. If war broke out, therefore, both sides would atpresent be bound only by the provisions of the regulations annexed to the 1907IVth Hague Convention which afford very inadequate protection for prisonerseofwar. Should the U.S.S.R. ratify the Conventions before we have done so, it wouldbe doubly necessary for us to act v/ith all despatch in order to give the U.S.S.R.no pretext, in the event of war, for differentiating against British prisoners of war.In any case, it is important that the United Kingdom should not contribute tothe delay in bringing these Conventions into force.8. From the point of view of our foreign relations also it would clearly be undesirable that these humanitarian Conventions should be ratified by the majorityof the Powers and not by the United Kingdom. Moreover, the Foreign Office,which is charged with the protection of British subjects abroad, considers it highly desirable that the provisions contained in the new Conventions for the protectionof civilians in time of war should be available for British subjects. We consider,therefore, that the Conventions should be ratified as soon as possible.IV. Legislation required to Implement the Conventions9. Before the provisions of the Conventions can be implemented in the UnitedKingdom, legislation will be required. The particular provisions in regard to whichit is thought that amendment of the law is needed are set out in Annex A. Of these provisions, those relating to the use of the emblems (paragraph 7 of Annex A) would,in the event of ratification, require immediate implementation; those relating to the punishment of grave breaches of the Conventions (discussed in paragraphs 14 to18 below) would not necessarily require immediate implementation, but might require implemention even in a conflict to which the United Kingdom was not a party, in order to enable us to deal with persons who, having committed gravebreaches of the Conventions in such a conflict, afterwards came into the hands ofour authorities; and the other provisions would require implementation only inthe event of an international conflict between the United Kingdom and anotherparty to the Conventions. There are two matters (the provisions of Article 118 (1)of the Civilian Convention and of Articles 87 (2) and 100 (3) of the Prisoners-of-war convention about minimum penalties, and the provisions about grave breachesmentioned above) which raise considerable difficulty. The other matters are not likely to be controversial.Article 118 (/) of the Civilian Convention, and Articles 87 (2) and 100 (3) of the prisoners of War Convention10.   The first point on which difficulty arises is in respect of Article 118 (i) ofthe Civilian Convention, which deals with the punishment of offences committed by internees during their internment.  This provision reads as follows:  &quot; The courts or authorities shall in passing sentence take as far as possibleinto account the fact that the defendant is not a national of the detaining power. They shall be free to reduce the penalty prescribed for the offencewith which the internee is charged and shall not be obliged to this end to apply the minimum sentence prescribed.&quot;11. Corresponding provision is made in Article 87 (2) of the Prisoners of war convention. In addition Article 100 (3) of the latter Convention provides thatsentence of death cannot be pronounced against a prisoner of war unless the court
has had its attention drawn to the fact that the accused is not bound by any dutyof allegiance to the Detaining Power.12. The difficulty that arises here is in connexion with the death sentence,which is the only penalty in a civilian court for murder and may be for other offences, e.g., treachery in time of war. We do not doubt that legislation is theonly means by which the provisions can strictly be implemented, but legislation would mean discrimination in favour of one class of persons and would be likelyto prove very controversial in Parliament and unacceptable to the judges. If thereis to be no legislation the alternative courses open to us are (a) to make a reservation on these provisions:   the objection to this course is that if, as is probable, the reservation were objected to by any otherPower, it might become impossible for the United Kingdom to become a party to these two Conventions;(b) to ratify without reservation and without legislation, relying on the prerogative of mercy to meet the demands of the provisions. Althoughthe use of the prerogative would go some way towards giving effectto those provisions, it does not strictly speaking fulfil our obligationsince its purpose is not to determine the scale of punishment but simply to temper the rigour of the law in particular cases. Moreover, these provisions are directed not only against the death penalty being executedbut also against its being pronounced (cf. Article 100 (3) of the Prisonersof War Convention) unless due consideration has been given to thestatus of the convicted person.13. Of the courses indicated above, (b) is the less difficult. At the meetingof Ministers on 2nd December, 1949 (GEN 281 Third Meeting), course (/;) waspreferred to a reservation on the grounds that the United Kingdom would find itself in an isolated position on this issue and that a reservation might be open tomisconstruction. It is understood that the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General are of the opinion that course (b), though by no means wholly satisfactory,is the one which, in all the circumstances, it would be best to follow.Articles 146 and 147 of the Civilian Convention and the corresponding articles in the other Conventions14. The second point which is a source of difficulty is in the provisions ofArticles 146 and 147 of the Civilian Convention. These and similar Articles in theother Conventions name certain acts which are to be regarded as grave breaches of the Conventions.   They require each High Contracting Party either (i) to try before its own courts offenders of whatever nationality who are changed with having committed a grave breach anywhere in the world,if they are in the hands of that High Contracting Party, or(ii) if it so prefers and if a prima facie case is made out, to hand such offendersover, in accordance with the provisions of its own legislation, for trialby the High Contracting Party concerned.15. These Articles are of such fundamental importance to the Conventionsthat it is unlikely that any United Kingdom reservation in regard to them wouldbe accepted by other Powers. To satisfy the requirements of the provisions inany particular case we must be ready either to try an accused person in our owncourts or to hand him over to another country for trial. The present law is such that we could not in every case meet either of these obligations. As regards handingpersons over for trial, deportation is inappropriate and, in the existing state of thelaw, extradition would not always be possible, either because the particular offencewas not an extradition crime or because the matter was of a political character inwhich case extradition is not allowed. Any course which would weaken our rightto grant asylum to political refugees is to be avoided. To amend our extraditionlaws and extend the list of extradition crimes so as to enable persons accused of grave breaches to be handed over to other countries might encourage foreign Powersto apply for extradition on grounds which would, in fact, be primarily political.We think, therefore, that implementation of these provisions should be in thedirection of enabling our courts to try offenders rather than of enabling us to handthem over to the other contracting parties.40941 ^ B 2
16. Without legislation we could not undertake to try all accused personsourselves because (i) not all the acts named in the Articles as grave breaches are criminal offences under our Jaw (e.g., unlawful deportation of a protected person)and(ii) our civilian courts ordinarily have jurisdiction only in respect of offences committed on our territory. Our civilian courts have a limited juris-diction over some offences committed outside the United Kingdom but such jurisdiction is not sufficient to enable us to meet the obligations of the Articles.17. The same considerations do not apply in the case of military courts. Itwould presumably be possible to provide by an order of the type of Army Order 81of 1945 for the convening of military courts abroad to try persons of any nationality(whether military or civilian) for grave breaches of Conventions wherever com-mitted, but it is very doubtful whether these courts could be convened in the UnitedKingdom or the Colonies, when the civilian courts are functioning, for the purposeof trying British subjects or other civilians for grave breaches committed in theUnited Kingdom or elsewhere.18. The legislation that would be needed to enable us to try in this country-grave breaches of the Convention, wherever committed, would be .(a) to make the acts named in the Article as grave breachesC) of the Conven-tions criminal offences according to the law of the United Kingdom.We consider that it will be necessary, in effect, to provide that any actconstituting a grave breach of the Conventions shall be a criminal offence.(b) to extend the jurisdiction of the appropriate civilian courts to cover gravebreaches of the Conventions committed outside the United Kingdomwhether by citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies or by others.In practice the jurisdiction would not be likely to be used often, becausethe evidence would not be in this country; but the capacity to try acase if the evidence were brought here would put us in the position ofbeing able to fulfil our obligations by trying an offender in this countryrather than by handing him over to another Power.19. The timing and scheme of legislation presents a problem. The provisions in the Conventions that require legislation are of two kinds:  (i) the provisions whose operation is not dependent on our being involved inarmed conflict, i.e., provisions relating to the use of emblems (para-graph 7 of Annex A) and grave breaches of the Conventions (para-graph 14); and(ii) the provisions which require special treatment to be afforded to personsprotected by the Conventions, and which thus operate only when we are involved in armed conflict. This class comprises all the provisions thatrequire legislation, except those in (i) above.We consider the best course is to introduce before ratification legislation which willmake all the necessary amendments in the law, and which will contain a provision that the operation of the provisions of the type (ii) above should be conditional ontheir being brought into force by Order in Council.(&apos;) The acts listed as &quot;grave breaches&quot; of the four Conventions are the following:  Wilful killing, torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments,wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health,extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by. military necessity, and carried out unlawfully and wantonly,* compelling a prisoner of war or a civilian &quot; protected person &quot; to serve in the forces ofthe hostile Power, . :* wilfully depriving a prisoner of war or a civilian &quot; protected person &quot; of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed in the convention,* unlawful deportation or transfer of a protected person,unlawful confinement of a protected person,* the taking of hostages.Those marked with an asterisk are not at present criminal offences under our law.
V. Issue of declaration by His Majesty&apos;s Government if war were to break outbefore the passage of the proposed Enabling Act.20. As far as the United Kingdom is concerned these Conventions will onlycome into operation in the event of war, if they have been ratified both by thiscountry and the enemy. Failing ratification before an emergency occurs the two following contingencies should be guarded against:  (a) The enemy has ratified the Conventions, we have not.(b) Neither we nor the enemy have ratified the Conventions.The position is governed by Article 2 (3) of each of the Conventions, which reads as follows:  &quot; Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the presentConvention, The Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it intheir mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisionsthereof.&quot;Contingency (a)In order to benefit by this stipulation, it would be desirable for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom to make a declaration, immediately on theoutbreak of war, to the effect that, pending ratification, the provisions of these fourConventions will be accepted and applied by the United Kingdom, subject to ourreservation on Article 68 of the Civilian Convention (death penalty in occupied countries). If the issue of such a declaration is approved now in principle, itwould not only minimise the risk of early confusion which might be detrimental to the interests of British Protected Persons but it would also enable our Govern-ment Departments to make their preparations on the basis that the 1949 Con-ventions will be applied by the United Kingdom from the outset.Contingency (b)Legally there is no way of bringing the Convention into force if neither wenor the enemy have ratified them. Our only weapon in the event of war would beto make a declaration as suggested above and to bring such pressure as we can onthe enemy to persuade him to make a reciprocal declaration.It would also be desirable to consult with such of the Atlantic Treaty and commonwealth countries as have not yet ratified the Conventions with a view to similar declarations being issued by those Governments immediately on theoutbreak of war.21.   We recommend (a) That legislation should be introduced as soon as possible to effect ail thenecessary changes in the law: the changes which are dependent fortheir operation on our being involved in armed conflict (paragraph19 (ii), to be brought into operation by Order in Council, the remainingchanges to be effective immediately.(b) That, after the passing of such legislation, the Conventions be ratified bythe United Kingdom, subject to our reservation on Article 68 of the civilian Convention which was made on signature.(c) That, pending the passing of legislation all necessary administrative measures should be taken by Government Departments to ensure thatthe 1949 Conventions can be applied without delay in the event of alarge-scale conflict.(d) That the actual date for the deposit of our ratification should be decided in collaboration with the Governments of the Commonwealth and ofthe North Atlantic Treaty Powers.(e) That, if war were to break out before the passage of the proposed EnablingBill, a declaration should be issued at once by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom accepting and applying the four 1949Geneva Conventions.22. In the course of its preparation this memorandum was submitted to theLaw Officers of the Crown, and the text was amended in the light of the discussion which took place.H.

Provisions of the Geneva Conventions requiring legislationCivilian Convention1. Article 71 (2) (3)This Article provides that the trial of an internee shall not proceed until at least three weeks notice has been given to the Protecting Power. It seems better to legislate to give effect to this provision rather than to leave the matter to the discretion of the courts, in view of the strict requirement of the article and the factthat some legislation will be necessary in any event.2. Article 74 (2)This article provides that the time allowed for appealing against sentence of death and sentences of imprisonment for two years or more passed on internees shallnot begin to run until the Protecting Power has received notice of the judgment.Amendments will have to be made to the present law relating to the time allowed for giving notice of appeal.3. Article 75 (2)This article provides that sentence of death shall not be executed on a protectedperson until at least six months after the Protecting Power has received notification of the final decision in the case. Legislation will be needed to give effect to thisprovision in Scotland, where there is a fixed time within which the sentence mustbe executed.4. Article 118 (1)See paragraph 10 of the Submission. It is not recommended that legislation should be introduced for this provision.5. Article 118 (4)This article provides that the time spent by an internee in custody while awaitingtrial shall be deducted from his sentence. There are no means by which this can bedone without legislation.6. Articles 146 and 147See paragraph 14 of the Submission.Wounded and Sick ConventionI. Articles 53 and 54These articles require that legislation be passed to prohibit the unauthoriseduse of the Red Cross, White Cross, Red Crescent and Red Lion and Sun emblems.The use of the Red Cross emblem is already covered by the Geneva ConventionsAct, 1911, and that of the White Cross emblem is partially covered by the GenevaConventions Act, 1937. Legislation will be required to protect the Red Crescentand Red Lion and Sun emblems and to give additional protection to the White Crossemblem. This legislation must be effective as soon as the Convention is ratified.8. Articles 49 and 50 (corresponding to Articles 146 and 147 of the civilian convention)See paragraph 14 of the Submission.Prisoner of War Convention9. Article 87(2) (corresponding to Article 118(i) of the Civilian Convention)See paragraph 10 of the Submission. Legislation is not recommended.10. Article 100(3) (corresponding to Article 118(i) of the Civilian Convention)See paragraph 10 of the Submission. Legislation is not recommended.II. Article 101This corresponds in relation to prisoners of war to Article 75(2) of the civilian convention.
12. Article 103(1)This provides that a prisoner of war may not be confined while awaiting trialfor longer than three months. Without legislation it would not be possible to securethat this article would be complied with in every case in which a prisoner of war washeld in civil custody while awaiting trial.13. Article 103(2)This corresponds in relation to prisoners of war to Article 118(4) of the civilian convention.14. Article 104(1) and (4)This corresponds in relation to prisoners of war to Article 71(2) and (3) civilian convention and the same considerations are applicable.15. Article 105(2) and (3)These articles provide that the Protecting Power must be allowed at least aweek in which to find counsel to defend a prisoner of war and that the counselappointed must be allowed at least two weeks in which to prepare his defence. Ifit is decided to legislate in respect of Article 71(2) and (3) of the Civilian convention and Article 104(1) of the Prisoners of War Convention it would be desirable for thesame reason to legislate in respect of these articles.16. Articles 129 and 130 (corresponding to Articles 146 and 147 of the civilian convention)See paragraph 14 of the Submission.Maritime Convention17. Articles 50 and 51 (corresponding to Articles 146 and 147 of the civilian convention)See paragraph 14 of the Submission.ANNEX BReservations Made by Certain Powers on Signing the Geneva Conventionsof 19491. A number of reservations have been made by States signatory of the 1949Geneva Conventions, some of which raise important issues. Governments failing to raise formal objection to a particular reservation may be held to have tacitlyagreed that, so far as their mutual relations with the reserving Power are concerned,the Conventions have been modified in the sense of that reservation. In any case a power failing to raise an objection before ratification would have no locus standi forobjecting subsequently should the country making the reservation act in accordancewith its terms.2. On the other hand the possible consequences of entering a formal objectionto a reservation must be taken into consideration. Although it is a doctrine whichis not universally accepted, many authorities on international law have maintained that, if one party to a convention formally objects to a reservation made by anotherparty, the state desirous of making the reservation must either withdraw the reser-vation and accept the convention without it or else remain outside the conventionaltogether.3. Another possible effect of a formal objection to a reservation might be to deter the Power which has made the reservation from ratifying the Geneva Con-ventions. This would be unfortunate particularly in the case of the Soviet Union because only the general acceptance of the Conventions would enable them tobe applied with maximum effectiveness.
4. For these reasons it would clearly be wise to limit as far as possible the raising of formal objections to reservations made by other Powers.5. The effect of the reservations made on signature of the Geneva Conven-tions have been carefully considered by Government Departments concerned andsome of them have formed the subject of correspondence with the commonwealth governments and the Governments of the United States, France,-Belgium and holland. As a result it is considered that the only reservations which might conceivably necessitate the formulation of an objection at the time of the deposit ofour ratification are (a) one of the reservations made by the U.S.S.R. (and associated powers) (b) one of those made by Spain and (c) one of those made by Portugal.6. The Soviet reservation in question applies to Article 85 of the Prisonersof War Convention. It reads as follows:  &quot; The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics does not consider itself bound by the obligation, which follows from Article 85, to extend the application ofthe Convention to prisoners of war who have been convicted under the law ofthe Detaining Power, in accordance with the principles of the Nuremberg trial,for war crimes and crimes against humanity, it being understood that persons convicted of such crimes must be subject to the conditions obtaining in thecountry in question for those who undergo their punishment.&quot;7. Article 85 of the Prisoners of War Convention, to which reference is made,provides that prisoners of war prosecuted under the law of the Detaining Power foracts committed prior to capture shall retain, even if convicted, the benefits of theConvention. It would appear on the face of it that under this reservation persons convicted by a Soviet court of war crimes and crimes against humanity are deprived of the benefits of the Convention and may be treated in whatever manner Soviet lawprovides for the treatment of prisoners undergoing punishment. It may, however,be found on enquiry that the scope of the reservation is not as wide as it appears.8. After consultation with the United States and other Governments, the swiss government (as the depository Power) were requested to ascertain from the SovietGovernment and the other East European Governments making the reservation which of the specific rights guaranteed by the Convention would, under this reservation,be denied to prisoners of war convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity.The Swiss Government have, however, deprecated any such approach at the presentmoment as being likely to delay the deposit of ratification by the Soviet and asso-ciated Governments; they add that this view is also strongly held by the Presidentof the International Red Cross Committee, who recently visited Moscow. Theyimply that they would be ready to make the enquiries after the Soviet ratificationhas been deposited.9. Having regard to this strongly expressed opinion and to the greatimportance of securing Soviet ratification of these Conventions, it would be undesirable for His Majesty&apos;s Government to assume the responsibility of addressingthe proposed enquiries direct to the Soviet Government at this time. Moreover thesituation has been complicated by the recent ratification of the Conventions by the czechoslovak Government which, on ratifying the Prisoners of War Convention,reaffirmed a reservation similar to the Soviet reservation; if the reservation is not formally objected to within a short interval of the deposit of the instrument of ratifi-cation it will be assumed to have been tactitly accepted by the other parties to theConvention.10.   The choice is therefore between lodging a formal objection now or waiting until the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have ratified the Conventions and then&quot; making the proposed enquiries, through the Swiss Government, in the hope that theSoviet Government may be persuaded to retain some at least of the rights to whichconvicted prisoners are entitled under the Convention.11. Although this reservation, if accepted, could lead to serious abuse, thereare several important reasons for not raising any formal objection to it:  (i) The attitude taken upon this question by the Soviet delegation at the geneva Conference makes it virtually certain that the U.S.S.R. wouldnot withdraw or modify its reservation in response to pressure by other powers or to a formal objection lodged by those Powers.
(ii) In those circumstances, the U.S.S.R. might, in accordance with the doctrineoutlined in paragraph 2 above, be held to be legally debarred from becoming a party to the Prisoners of War Convention, even if otherwiseprepared to do so.(iii) A United Kingdom objection to this Soviet reservation might well provoke a Soviet objection to our own reservation to Article 68 of the civilian convention, to which the Soviet delegation strongly objected at thetime. This would produce an embarrassing situation since we mightbe obliged to either withdraw our reservation or, according to the legaldoctrine referred to in paragraph 2 above, to remain outside the civilian convention.12. In view of the above considerations, it would not be in our interest tooffer any formal objection to this Russian reservation at the time of the deposit ofthe United Kingdom ratification. The United States Government, with whom we have been in consultation on this point, state that in the circumstances they donot propose to pursue this matter further with the Swiss Government at the presenttime. The Governments of the Commonwealth countries have been informed thatthis is the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government.General Reservation made by Spain13. The second reservation to which particular exception is taken is onemade to the Prisoners of War Convention by the Spanish Government. It isas follows:  &quot; In matters regarding procedural guarantees and penal and disciplinarysanctions, Spain will grant prisoners of war the same treatment as is providedby her legislation for members of her own national forces.&quot;14. The effect of this reservation is that prisoners of war in Spanish handswould lose all the disciplinary and judicial guarantees which form so important apart of the Prisoners of War Convention. This represents so serious a departure from the essential purpose of the Convention that it seems impossible to allow the reservation to pass without comment.15. The position as regards this Spanish reservation is different from thatcreated by the Russian reservation in that it is unlikely, at least so far as theforseeable future is concerned, that Spain will be involved in a war against theUnited Kingdom. The exclusion of Spain from the Prisoners of War Convention,owing to the lodging of a formal objection by the United Kingdom, would not,therefore, in practice have the disadvantages involved in the exclusion of one ofthe Great Powers. On the other hand, there is always the possibility that if we and other Powers formally object to this Spanish reservation, the Spanish Govern-ment might, in reprisal, object to our reservation under Article 68 of the Prisonersof War Convention (imposition of the death penalty in occupied territory).16. It is to be hoped that, as a result of the representations now beingaddressed to the Spanish Government by the Governments of the United Kingdom,Canada, India, the United States, France and the Netherlands, the Spanish reserva-tion may be withdrawn or modified. If not, the question of lodging a formalreservation will have to be considered, in collaboration with the other interested governments. In any case, it seems preferable that the lead in this matter shouldbe left to other signatory States which have not made reservations of their own.Reservation made by Portugal to Article 13 of the Wounded and Sick convention and Article 4 of the Prisoners-of-War Convention17.   This reservation is as follows:  &quot; The Portuguese Government makes a reservation regarding the appiica-tion of the above Articles in all cases in which the legitimate Government hasalready asked for and agreed to an armistice for the suspension of militaryoperations of no matter what character, even if the armed forces in the fieldhave not yet capitulated.&quot;18. The two Articles referred to in the reservation define the categories ofcombatants or prisoners to which these Conventions apply.
19. The purpose of this reservation is not clear. Enquiries have been madein Lisbon, as a result of which it is hoped that the Portuguese Government willeither withdraw or elucidate it. Although it is doubtful whether Portugal intendedthe reservation to have such an effect, it might be interpreted as an intention to withhold the benefits of the Prisoners-of-War and Sick and Wounded Conventionsfrom enemy forces surrendering after an armistice and from members of organised resistance movements who continue their operations after an armistice has beenarranged.20. Failing the withdrawal of this reservation, it may be necessary to consider,in consultation with other interested countries, the desirability of making a formalobjection to it.
