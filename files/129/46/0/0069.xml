SIS DOC  MENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential cp. (51) 219 COPY NO.^_20TH JULY, 1951CABINETNATIONAL, SERVICE OF-&apos;RAILWAYMENMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and national service the Minister of Transport proposes in his paper (CP. (51) 215)that a decision should be taken to defer the national service call-up of alimited number of railwaymen in the key operating grades.   I understand the number involved is of the order of about 3,000 men over the period of ayear.This proposal had already been strongly urged upon me by theRailway Executive and the British Transport Commission and after full consideration I have informed them that it would not be possible to make this concession.   I am still strongly of the opinion that it is impossible to concedewhat the railways are now asking for, and I can find nothing in the british transport Commission^ memorandum circulated with the Minister ofTransport&apos;s paper which was not in substance before me when I refused their previous request.The two fundamental reasons which in my view make it impossiblefor us to concede deferment to railway workers are as follows:-(1) The whole policy of national service in peace time has been basedupon the universal liability to the obligation.   This policy has been repeatedlyannounced and endorsed in Parliament and it is only by the maintenance ofthis principle that we can hope to continue to have general public support forthe policy of national service in peace time.The only exceptions up till now have been the coalmining industryand agriculture, and we are in process now of generally removing thisexceptional treatment from agriculture, leaving only coalminers eligiblefor deferment on grounds of their civil employment.   We can I think hold theposition so long as no further exceptions are made because the undergroundand special nature of employment in the coalmines is generally recognised and provides justification for an exception for the time being in that case.(2) The second serious point is that many important industries and services are short of labour at the present time and if once we allowed a departure from the general application of national service imposed on youngmen it would be quite impossible to confine the exception to one particular industry.   Once it was extended beyond the very limited field now covered andexceptions made in favour of the railway industry, many other industries would be able to make out an equally good case.   In particular the fact that the railwaymen to be deferred are relatively unskilled would make it all the moredifficult to resist claims from the engineering and other industries for theprotection from call-up of skilled men who have completed apprenticeship.In addition therefore to the dangerous breach of the general principle in (1)above, we should be very gravely imperilling the supply to the Armed Forces
of the numbers of men required to meet the needs of defence;  even underthe present arrangements the Armed Forces are not obtaining all thenational service men they need.I would urge therefore that on the above two grounds alone.- theproposal to allow deferment in the railway industry should not be approved.I would, however, add the following secondary points on the merits of theapplication which has b een made:-(i) Although the railways are laying great stress on the fact thatthey will be losing men to the Services during the coming year, they do notlay equal stress on the fact that they will at the same time be receiving backroughly an equivalent number of men completing national service.   the call-up of national service men does not therefore mean a net reduction inthe numbers available for the railways.- &quot;. (ii):,- The men concerned are all young men just over 18 years ofage and though I recognise that many of these are in the lower ranks of key-operating grades, it seems to me that one cannot justify the proposition thatyoung men of 18 years of age are so very vital to the service as to make a breakdown inevitable.   These young men are mostly in the cleaner grade,though some of them have at that early age been promoted to firemen.I think that almost any other course ought to be taken to supply the needs ofthese grades rather than deferment of their military service.   We ought, forexample, to be prepared to put up with the most drastic curtailment of passenger services in preference to taking a step which might entirelydisrupt the national service scheme.(iii) The railways have still not had all the co-operation they ought to have from the trade union side in easing the situation by modi-fications of conditions.   Indeed, a letter from the General Secretary of the associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen to the Ministerof Transport dated 11th July specifically says that their willingness toconsider the necessary easement is provisional upon the Governmentagreeing to deferment of call-up.   This seems to me quite the wrong wayround to approach the problem.(iv) It may well be that the drift from the railways during last winter was largely due to difficulty in recruiting additional staff andexcessive wastage during the long period of unrest on the railways whilethe wage claims put in by the Railway Unions remained unsettled.   Theposition has, in fact, improved somewhat since the wage claim was granted,the total staff in operating grades having increased continuously in threesuccessive monthly periods from 298,113 at 25th March, 1951, to 299,790at 17th June, 1951.   The increase is admittedly not great but it contrasts witha steep and practically continuous fall from 312,759 at May, 1950, andsuggests that, at any rate, the draft away has been arrested.A.
