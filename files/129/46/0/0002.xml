G.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,3lst May, 1951.ANNEXSCHUMAN PLAN:   REPLY TO THE FRENCH INVITATION TO HOLDDISCUSSIONS WITH HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTReport by the Economic Steering CommitteeM. Schuman recently told the Foreign Secretary, through the british ambassador in Paris, that he would be ready to hold discussions with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, if they so desired, on the Schuman Plan, before it was submitted tothe Parliaments of the six signatory Powers. For the reasons indicated in para-graphs 18 to 25 of the attached report by the Schuman Plan Working Party, wedo not consider that it is desirable or necessary either on economic of political grounds to embark on such discussions at present, though we would not wish to close the door upon such discussions before the Treaty is ratified if, after a fullstudy of the Treaty, this should appear advantageous in the light of the general position. We accordingly endorse the recommendation of the Working Party thata reply should be given to M. Schuman on the following lines:  (a) The text of the Treaty is at present being studied by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.(b) Until such studies are complete, we shall not be in a position to indicate the manner and timing of the discussions we should wish to have withthe Community.(c) We note with pleasure from Section 14 of the Interim Provisions that theCommunity intend to initiate negotiations with us.2. The Working Party on the Schuman Plan is preparing a full report on the schuman Treaty.   A summary of its Provisions, and a preliminary assessment40661 b
of its implications for the United Kingdom are given in paragraphs 3 to 17 of theWorking Party&apos;s Report below.3. Discussions with the other Governments concerned regarding the relation-ship between the Schuman Treaty and the Allied controls over Germany&apos;s heavyindustry, will also be necessary in the near future as a result of the French initiativewhich has been considered by Ministers. These will take place, however, not in aSchuman Plan context but in an appropriate Inter-Allied forum.4. The general attitude of the United Kingdom has now been dealt with ina Parliamentary Answer to Mr. Mallalieu (Hansard No. 93, Column 49) on24th April, on the lines in paragraph 28 of the Working Party&apos;s Report.E. N. P.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,25th April, 1951Schuman Plan : Interim Report by the Working Party on the ProposedFranco-German Coal and Steel authority the Foreign Ministers of France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg andthe Netherlands, signed on 18th April the Treaty setting up for fifty years a european coal and Steel Community. The Treaty does not come into effect until ratified bythe six countries with the approval of their Parliaments. This may occurbefore the summer recess of the six Parliaments, but may well take longer.Approval is not certain. While the six Governments are fully committed to it, thereare elements of hostile opinion in all countries; in Germany, in particular, the social democrats on the left and influential interests on the right are opposed to it.2. This interim report summarises the main features of the Treaty and InterimProvisions (paragraphs 3 to 11) and makes recommendations in the light of a preliminary assessment of the implications of the Treaty for the United kingdom on two matters on which early Ministerial decisions are necessary, i.e. (a) the line to be adopted towards M. Schuman&apos;s proposal to hold preliminarytalks on the question of relationships between the United Kingdom andthe Coal and Steel Community, and(b) the line to be adopted in public statements on the attitude of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to the Treaty.The Main Features of the Treaty3. The Treaty creates a free market for coal and steel within the six countriessubject to exceptions during a transitional period of five to seven years. As betweenthe Governments, this involves the abolition of tariff barriers and quantitative restrictions, subsidies, and discriminatory transport arrangements and the obligationto consult the Community on commercial treaties. For the producers it involves theabolition of discriminatory price practices and restrictive practices&quot;by individual firms,associations or cartels. The Treaty sets up institutions with wide regulatory powersboth for the attaining and maintenance of the free market, and for supervising thegeneral policies of the industry in regard to investment, prices, and, in times of surplus or slump, the regulation of production. These powers are to be operated asmuch as possible by consultation and consent, and on a basis of full publicity.4., The policies of the Community are to be governed by certain general principles.   It mission is defined in Article 2 of the Treaty as follows:  &quot; The mission of the European Coal and Steel Community is to contribute to economic expansion, the development of employment and the improvementof the standard of living in the participating countries through the institution,in harmony with the general economy of the member States, of a single marketas defined in Article 4. ;&quot; The Community must progressively establish conditions which will in themselves assure the most rational distribution at the highest possible level of productivity, while avoiding the creation of fundamental and persistent dis-turbances in the economies of the member States.&quot;
5. Article 3 states that the Community shall (a) see that the market is regularlysupplied, taking account of the needs of third countries, (b) assure all consumerswithin the market equal access to the sources of production, (c) seek the establish -ment of fair and stable prices at the lowest level practicable, (d) encouragemodernisation, expansion and rational development of resources, (e) promote betterworking conditions for labour, (/) further the development of international trade and fair prices in external markets.Institutions6. The executive functions of the Community are vested in a High Authority,&apos; appointed by, but not representative of, Governments. It is to be composed of ninemembers (all nationals of member States) not. more than two of whom can benationals of one member State. Eight of them are to be appointed by governments and they will co-opt one more. It is advised by a Consultative Committee composedof management, labour, consumers and distributors. The High Authority is called to account once a year before an Assembly representative of the Parliaments of member States, which may demand the resignation of the members of the high authority. The Assembly has 78 members; 18 each from France, Germany andItaly, 10 each from Belgium and the Netherlands, and 4 from Luxembourg. Theaction of the High Authority is to be harmonised with that of Governments by consultation between it and a Council of Ministers; which also has powers of controlover some actions by the High Authority. The voting in the Council of Ministersgives special weight to voices of France and Germany. The extent to which thecreation of the Council of Ministers modifies the original supra-national concept,of the High Authority is considered in paragraph 11 below. Finally, there is a Courtof Justice which interprets the Treaty in all disputes, using the text of the Treaty as its body of law. This is an elaborate complex of machinery, and no-one can fore-tell how it will function. The High Authority and other institutions are financed by levies on the production of coal and steel.Transitional Provisions7. The single market could not be created immediately without causingserious disturbances in the economies of the member States. Accordingly, whiletariffs and quantitative restrictions and discriminatory transport charges are inprinciple to be abolished within the Group six months after the High Authority is setup, there is provision for a transitional period of 5 to 7 years, during which sometariffs, subsidies, and restrictions of various kinds may be continued to cushion the impact of the setting up of the single market on high cost producers. The high authority will be empowered to assist in co-operation with Governments&apos; workersthrown out of work.8. For coal, a levy is to be imposed on a diminishing basis for five years onlow cost producers (i.e., Germany and the Netherlands), the proceeds of which,subject to at least an equal contribution by Governments, will be used to reducecoal prices in Belgium and Italy to ensure that their coal production may not fallby more than a small (specified) amount annually in relation to the total productionof the Community. To the extent that is necessary to achieve the same purpose for french coal, a levy is to be imposed on additional imports into France. There isalso special provision for the Belgian Government to &quot; isolate &quot; the Belgian coalmarket if necessary, by any means, tariffs, quantitative restrictions, &amp;c.9. On steel, Italian steel can be protected by the retention of tariffs at a diminishing level on supplies from other members of the Community, and the high authority will take account of the exceptional importance of steel to Luxembourg.The High Authority has general powers to &quot; isolate &quot; any part of the steel industry of the Community which may be particularly affected by the setting up of a singlemarket. These transitional provisions must end in five (in some cases seven) years.Permanent Economic Provisions10. Subject to the transitional provisions, these come into effect when theTreaty is ratified. The main provisions may be summed up as giving powers tothe Community through its institutions:  (a) To maintain the single market.(b) To control output if the Community is faced either with a serious fall in demand, or with a serious shortage of some or all of the products subject40661 b 2
to its jurisdiction. In a slump the Community can impose equitableproduction quotas and fine those who violate them. In time of shortage,it can allocate production among the countries of the Community^though allocation within each country is left to Governments; at thesame time, placing restrictions on exports to third countries. In both cases these powers are only to be used if &quot; indirect means of action &quot; are inadequate; by &quot; indirect means&quot; in this case is meant co-operationwith Governments to regularise or influence general consumption,particularly that of the public services and intervention on prices and commercial policy.(c) To keep prices stable and low-eliminating artificial practices and discrimination - *nation; and to prevent discriminatory transport tariffs.(d) .To guide, oversee, and assist approved investment by loans or guarantee of loans.(e) To prevent any form of competitive wage-cutting.(/) To prohibit agreements among enterprises and amalgamations of enter-prises where these carry monopolistic dangers.(g) To protect the Community by imposing quantitative restrictions againstfirms and countries outside the Community when those firms orcountries are themselves engaging in &quot; objectionable &quot; activities. Further,quantitative restrictions may be imposed on imports from outside whenproduction quotas are in operation.(h) To present a &quot; united front &quot; in commercial relations with other countries.11. As has been said, the High Authority has the executive authority. the ministerial Council has certain powers of control over it; for example, in regard tothe introduction of a system of production quotas in time of slump; the introductionof rationing measures to deal with a state of scarcity; the restriction of exports to non-members; the fixing of minimum and maximum tariff rates; the establishmentof quantitative restrictions against non-members. These and other powers are important, but the main body of specified powers rest with the High Authority. Itis clear that the member countries are making definite though limited cessions of sovereignty to the institutions of the Community. These are hedged about bychecks and balances, to a much greater extent than in the original proposals. Butthe supra-national character of the Community has again been stressed by theMinisters at the time of signature.Implications of the Schuman Treaty for the United Kingdom12. The full provisions of the Treaty and Interim Provisions have only recently been known, and the Working Party, with the Departments concerned isat present examining the implications for the United Kingdom coal and steel industries. The implications for the United Kingdom depend in part on the general attitude and behaviour of the High Authority and other institutions of the Com-munity, which can vary widely within the framework of the Treaty, and which will themselves largely depend on the degree and conditions of association between theUnited Kingdom and the Community. In very general terms, the more closely it is associated with the Community, the better the United Kingdom can influence thedevelopment of policies along lines which are not prejudicial to us, but the moreour freedom of action would be circumscribed.13. It is convenient to look at the position in the first place on the basis ofthe United Kingdom being outside the Community without special arrangements with it. The Working Party, in its report last June, reached the conclusion that bystaying out, the United Kingdom might suffer some but not intolerable disadvantageover a continuing period. Since then the immediate situation has changed from oneof potential surplus into one of continuing shortage.14. As regards coal, we have a very great interest in the markets of the schuman countries, but have, in the past, been severely handicapped by the quantitative restrictions imposed by them, and by various unfair practices followedby the Germans and Poles before the war. The Treaty professes liberal principlesvis-a-vis third countries as well as within the Community. To the extent that theseare followed, the need of association to further our coal interests would be less.But whether it would be possible to secure the removal of restrictions, and the cessation-tion of unfair practices, short of full association with the Community, cannot bereliably assessed. But it is certain that these are objectives of major importanceto the long-term interests of the United Kingdom coal trade.  In the short run
the creation of the Community can scarcely affect us, in face of the scarcity ofUnited Kingdom coal, and the transitional safeguards for the interests of theFrench, Belgian and Italian coal industries.15. In regard to steel, the situation has to be examined in the light of the likelihood of a continuing shortage of steel-making raw materials. The Treatycontains provisions regarding the allocation of scrap (presumably to the exclusion of non-members) but the Ministry of Supply have not, however, regarded germany as a long-term source of supply. As regards iron ore, the small quantities we obtain from North-West France are not, in view of transport factors, likely to be prejudiced.The supplies of ore from French Africa, which are important to us, are outsidethe control of the High Authority, though under shortage conditions we expect that the French would be under considerable pressure to give some preference totheir fellow-members (the Italians have apparently already secured an agreement about supplies of French North African ore). On the other hand we have, or arenegotiating, substantial financial interests in- certain new schemes in French Africa.16. More generally, the creation of the Community would be likely to tendto improve the competitive position of the steel industry of the Group, particularlythat of Germany. In the longer run, with a growing free market and growingspecialisation, costs of production in the Community should fall. But even without this Treaty, the German competitive position is likely to improve, while within theCommunity the non-German interests are likely to want to keep within bounds thedevelopment and improvement of the German industry.17. Our first reactions are that the creation of the Community does not create a serious threat to the United Kingdom coal and steel interests even if no arrange-ments were made for close relationship between the United Kingdom and theCommunity, but we think that our long-term interests may well make some formof mutually satisfactory association desirable. Much further careful analysis is needed both of the complex provisions of the Treaty and their detailed bearing on United Kingdom interests and of the arguments for and against various possiblearrangements between the United Kingdom and the Community. This is in hand.Negotiations between the United Kingdom and the Community18. Apart from the general question of association, discussions between theCommunity and the United Kingdom Government will probably take placeregarding the United Kingdom attitude towards the request which Schumancountries will have to make to the Contracting Parties to G.A.T.T. in order tosecure a waiver of their obligations under G.A.T.T., which are in conflict withthe intentions of the Treaty. Furthermore, the French Government are going to invite the other Governments concerned to discussions regarding the relationship between the Schuman Treaty and the Allied Controls over Germany&apos;s heavyindustry-see CP. (51) 108 and CM. (51) 28th Conclusions, Minute 2. these negotiations are outside the scope of this paper.19. The timing of formal negotiations between the Community and theUnited Kingdom is governed by Section 14 of the Interim Provisions, which reads:  &quot; Upon establishment of the High Authority, the member States shallundertake negotiations with the Governments of third countries, and particu-. larly with the British Government, on over-all economic and commercial relations concerning coal and steel between the Community and such countries.The High Authority, acting upon instructions adopted unanimously by theCouncil, shall act for the member States as a group in these negotiations.Representatives of the member States may be present at these negotiations.&quot;The participants in the Paris discussions have always taken the line that a closerelationship should be established between the Community and the UnitedKingdom. This point of view has been reaffirmed by the French Foreign Ministerand German Federal Chancellor, who have expressed the hone that the UnitedKingdom will enter into a special agreement with the six countries. Such anagreement could not, of Course, be made until after the Treaty was ratified.20. However, some talks could take place in the intervening period beforethe Treaty is ratified. M. Schuman told the Foreign Secretary last week, throughthe British Ambassador in Paris, that he will be ready to hold discussions with
*His Majesty&apos;s Government, if they so desire, before the Plan is submitted toParliament.21. The immediate question is whether we should take advantage ofM. Schuman&apos;s suggestion that there should be preliminary talks. It appears thatthere is some possibility of talks with the six participant countries at an early stage,and that we shall receive no more formal invitation. Some reply should thereforebe given to M. Schuman on the basis of what he has already said.22. It would be premature, even if our own objective could be clearly defined in the near future, to embark on thorough-going discussions of a Treaty which mayhot be ratified/ It may, however, be desirable to seek preliminary elucidation on certain specific points, so that we can more easily determine in advance the line to be pursued in formal talks after ratification Some of these points could conveniently be taken up in other contexts, e.g., the compatibility with G.A.T.T. ofsections of the Treaty enabling quantitative instructions to be imposed. Whether ornot it would be necessary to embark immediately on preliminary discussions dependspartly on the date at which ratification may be completed in the various Parliaments.There is probably no need for immediate action.23. From some points of view, it would be advantageous at least to delay and preliminary discussions, so that full time may be given to the examination of the documents now before us. But, on the other hand, the following considerations should be borne in mind:  (a) By refusing to embark on discussions at an early stage, we might miss theopportunity of keeping in touch with the practical development of the schuman Plan; but there is not likely to be much in the way of develop-ments before ratification.(b) The fact of our entering upon even preliminary and non-committaldiscussions might favourably impress the Socialist Parties in participantcountries and so improve the chances of ratification, particularly in theGerman Parliament. It is, however, unlikely that any action from our side would be vitally important in this connection.(c) Participation in discussion might conceivably be misinterpreted as a desireto sabotage or shape the Treaty to our own ends. This is unlikely atthe present stage, but equally there is no disadvantage in maintaining our previous attitude of benevolent disinterest.24. On the whole, therefore, it hardly seems desirable or necessary to embark on immediate preliminary discussions on specific points, though it would be desir-able to leave the door open for such discussions later. A further reason for goingslow at present is that His Majesty&apos;s Government is already committed to a con-ference of interested Powers on the overlap of jurisdiction between the schuman plan machinery on the one hand and on the other the existing international controlof the German coal and steel industries. At this conference, which is likely to takeplace soon, it may well be possible to obtain additional light in important aspectsof the Schuman Plan.25. It is therefore recommended that a reply should be given to M. Schuman&apos;invitation on the following lines:(a) That the text of the Treaty is at present being studied by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.(b) Until such studies are complete, we shall not be in a position to indicate the manner and timing of the discussions we should wish to have withthe Community.(c) We note with pleasure from section 14 of the Interim Provisions that theCommunity intend to initiate negotiations with us.Public Attitude by the United Kingdom26. The general attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the discussions inParis was made clear in the exchanges with the French Government last May and june, and the Parliamentary debates here in June. It has been maintained in sub-sequent Parliamentary statements and discussions in the Council of Europe.27.  The main points are:(a) that His Majesty&apos;s Government welcomed the French initiative andearnestly hoped that an agreement would be reached;
(b) that the United Kingdom could not take part in the Paris discussionsbecause of the initial condition imposed of prior acceptance of the setting up of a supra-national authority;(c) that we had deliberately refrained from putting forward any counter pro-posals of our own lest these might delay agreement, and(d) that if agreement is reached, we should be most anxious to consider howfar we could be associated with any new organisation created by the six Governments and Parliaments.The latest statement, in a Written Answer to a Question on 20th March, 1951,expressed gratification of the initialling of the Treaty by experts and informed theHouse that His Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Paris had been kept generally informed ofthe progress of the negotiations.28. It seems clear that for the present the United Kingdom attitude can bedealt with on the same lines, that is to say(a) that His Majesty&apos;s Government welcome the fact that agreement has nowbeen reached, and(b) that we are most anxious.to consider how and how far we could be associated with the proposed organisation.It is reasonable for the Government to wish to take time to consider the situation created by the signature of the Treaty, and not to give any indication of its attitude to the arrangements or to United Kingdom association with them.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,20th April, 1951.
