V -    159HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential cp .(51) 181 COPY NO.   3126TH JUNE, 1951CABINETEQUAL pay memorandum by the Minister of Labourand National service on 5th June, 1951, the Cabinet decided (C. M. (51) 40thConclusions, Minute 6) that the United Kingdom Government delegate to theInternational Labour Conference should, in Committee, press for the adoptionof regulations in the form of a Recommendation (and not a Convention) on equal Pay and should be prepared, if necessary, to propose an amendment to this effect in the Plenary Session of the Conference.2. At the outset of the discussions in Committee the UnitedKingdom Government delegate endeavoured to secure that the Committee should proceed on the basis of a Recommendation.   The Committee, however, decided by a majority in favour of a Convention plus a Recommendation;  the convention to consist of principles and the Recommendation to consist of clauses onthe application of those principles.3. The Committee have now drafted a Convention plus a Recom-mendation which will be before the Plenary Session of the Conference on tuesday, 26th June.   If the Convention is passed by the Conference the UnitedKingdom will not be able to ratify it.   The United Kingdom government delegates, in accordance with the decision of the Cabinet, endeavoured in committee to secure an amendment of the main operative clause of theConvention which, if passed, might have enabled us to ratify.   The amendment,however, was lost by a heavy majority.4. When the Committee&apos;s report comes before the Plenary SessionI have instructed the United Kingdom Government delegate to try and get an amendment moved, or if necessary to move it himself, to reverse thedecision of the Committee and make the Convention into a Recommendation.This will be in accordance with the Cabinefs decision.   If this amendment is passed - and it may be, since only a bare majority is necessary - the draftConvention will go back to the Committee and be re-drafted as a Recommendation,in which case no further difficulty will arise and the United KingdomGovernment delegate will vote in favour of the Recommendation when it isreturned to the Conference.5. If, however, the amendment is rejected, I have instructed theUnited kingdom Government delegate to move the same amendment to themain operative clause of the Convention that he moved in Committee.   It is unlikely that this amendment will be passed.   We shall, however, have doneeverything possible to secure a Convention which we can ratify.6. After the report stage, a draft Convention comes before the Plenary jSession for a final vote on the draft as a whole (it cannot be amended at thisstage), and has to secure a two-thirds majority to be passed.   If it secures
a majority, but not a two-thirds majority, the draft Convention is sent backto be transformed into a Recommendation.   A similar procedure operates ifthe necessary quorum of 50% of those entitled to vote is not obtained.7. If neither of the United -kingdom Government delegatedamendments is accepted in Plenary Session on the report stage, the draftConvention plus Recommendation will come before the Plenary Session(probably on Friday* 29th June), for a final vote.   It will be necessary to instruct the United Kingdom Government delegate how to vote.   He could notvote in favour as this would, in effect, commit the Government to ratification.There are, therefore, two courses open -(1) to abstain, in the hope that there would be a failure to obtain a quorum.   It is, however, very unlikely that we should succeed in this as the employers will certainly vote against.(2) to vote against, in the hope that, while there would be a majority,there would not be the necessary two-thirds majority and thedraft Convention would then be sent back.If the latter course were adopted the United Kingdom Government delegatewould explain to the Conference the reason why, although accepting theprinciple of equal pay, the United Kingdom Government voted against thedraft Convention.A.
