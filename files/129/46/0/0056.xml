-7. IS&quot;^   /IIS  DOCUMENT  IS THE  PROPERTY   OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTYS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1951CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.CP. (51) 20613//; July, 1951(cabinet general ENQUIRY INTO SUPPLEMENTARY  PENSIONSSCHEMESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.A year ago, on 13th July, 1950, the Cabinet agreed that a DepartmentalCommittee of experienced persons should be set up to enquire into the general problems presented by supplementary pensions schemes. The Committee has notyet been constituted because of the opposition of the General Council of the TradesUnion Congress to the idea of an enquiry. The results of the protracted negotia-tions with the General Council have been reported to the Cabinet from time totime, the last occasion being 29th January, 1951, when Ministers agreed to await the outcome of further discussions in the Economc Committee and General Council ofthe Trades Union Congress before proceeding with the enquiry.2. The need for an examination of the lines along which supplementary pensions schemes should develop has increased substantially during the last year.The Government announced, in connection with the recent changes in the retire-ment provisions of the National Insurance scheme, that they were aiming at ahigher retiring age for persons in employment, and this has repercussions on theform which pension schemes should take. The pension scheme for miners and surface workers employed by the National Coal Board is bound to increase the pressure for similar schemes in other nationalised industries. Faced with demandsby the unions for pensions schemes for industrial workers, the British electricity authority and the British Transport Commission are pressing for a clear statementof the Governments position. This pressure cannot be resisted indefinitely. Theremust be a policy as to which features of pensions proposals can be approved andwhich must be rejected.3. The latest meeting with representatives of the General Council of theTrades Union Congress was held on 26th June, 1951. The Minister of Labour, theMinister of National Insurance and I put before them the various considerations which, in the Governments view, made it essential to proceed quickly with theproposed independent enquiry into the whole problem of supplementary pensions.We explained that the position of Ministers, on whom lay the statutory duty ofapproving pension schemes in socialised industries, was obviously very difficult inthe absence of the kind of guidance which the report of the proposed committee,could give them. We added that the enquiry would have been quite as necessary and urgent if the socialised industries, had not presented a special problem.4. The representatives of the General Council admitted that there weregeneral problems which should be looked into, especially in the National Insurancefield, but they did not seem to regard these problems as urgent. It appeared thata considerable section of the Council could only see in the enquiry an obstaclein the way of individual unions obtaining from the Boards of socialised industries and from private employers new pension schemes or extensions of schemes already in existence. They tend&quot;ed to ignore the possibility that it might not be possible inthe long run to maintain these schemes or that it might only be possible to maintainthem at the expense of workers less favourably placed for bargaining. We pointed40903
out that there was nothing in the Governments proposal to prevent the unions, ifthey wished, discussing with the Boards of socialised industries or with private employers the possibilities of pension schemes at the same time as the Governmentsenquiry was proceeding, but the T.U.C. representatives did not accept this.5. The T.U.C. representatives agreed that the matter should be given furtherconsideration by the General Council, but we were left in little doubt that theCouncil would be asked to adhere to their previous refusal to support the Govern-ment in setting up the proposed enquiry. They might even go further and dissociatethemselves in some public way from the enquiry, and might decline to suggestsuitable representatives of the workers&apos; point of view for membership of theCommittee. Opinion on the Council is, however, divided on this issue. There isconsiderable support for an enquiry: and, if the Government now set up the com-mittee, those elements might well be able to prevail on the rest to co-operate withthe Government.6. The members of the Socialisation of Industries Committee are agreed thata general enquiry into supplementary pensions schemes is urgently required.andthat in any event it is difficult for the Government to retract from the policy of holding an enquiry because of opposition expressed on the General Council. Wehave considered various alternative procedures, such as a strictly fact-findingenquiry by a committee of Government officials, but we are satisfied that any suchcourse would merely delay the formulation of a definite policy on the subject,which, as indicated above, is urgently required. In the view of the Committee,the dangers of any further delay in the appointment of a Departmental Committee,consisting mainly of persons outside the public service, outweigh the risk that theT.U.C. may express open disagreement with the Government.7. The Socialisation of Industries Committee accordingly recommend that steps should be taken forthwith to set up a Departmental Committee and that a public announcement to this effect should be made. Every endeavour should be madeto secure that the Committee completes its enquiry in the shortest practicable time,probably about five or six months, and the members of the Committee, and inparticular its Chairman, should be chosen with the need for an urgent completionof the task in mind. To minimise the risk that the T.U.C. or individual unionsmay openly-dissociate themselves from the Governments decision and refuse toco-operate in the enquiry, we think that we should follow up the recent meeting with representatives of the General Council by sending to the General Council aletter and an explanatory memorandum in the terms of the appended drafts. Thiswould give the T.U.C. a full statement of the considerations which compel theGovernment to institute an enquiry, as well as giving revised terms of reference.If, in spite of this, the T.U.C. still decline to co-operate, we consider that theGovernment should proceed with the appointment of the Committee, leaving twovacancies upon it to be filled if and when the T.U.C. should decide to nominaterepresentatives of the Trade Union movement.A. of H.Great George Street, London, SWA,Uth July, 1951.
DRAFT LETTER TO TRADES UNION congress the Government has now given further consideration to the letter which yousent to Mr. Herbert Morrison on 2nd March, 1951, about the proposed supple-mentary pensions enquiry and to my report of the discussions which certain members of the Council had with me and my colleagues, the Minister of Labourand the Minister of National Insurance, on 26th June.Developments since this matter was first raised with the General Council have,in the Governments view, increased the need for such an enquiry as they have pro-posed and its urgency. They have accordingly reaffirmed the earlier decision toproceed with the appointment of a committee of independent persons of standingfor this purpose.   The terms of reference now proposed are:  To consider and make recommendations concerning the long-term social and economic aspects of the development of schemes for retirement and old age pensions additional to the provisions already made by the National insurance acts.At our meeting on 26th June the suggestion was made that the Council had not,in discussions and correspondence, received a sufficient indication of the grounds which, in the Governments view, made the completion of such an enquiry not onlynecessary but urgent. 1 am therefore enclosing with this letter a statement of theprincipal considerations which have been in the Governments mind.The members of the Council also raised the question of the relationship ofthis proposed enquiry to claims for supplementary pension schemes already made or in prospect not only in the socialised industries but elsewhere. The Govern-ment are anxious that the enquiry which they are setting up should complete their task as quickly as possible because, in the absence of the guidance which they would expect to derive from the Committee of Enquiry&apos;s report, it will be difficult for ministers who have statutory responsibilities in relation to the approval of pension schemes or modifications of pension schemes to exercise their functions in ways which are compatible with the national interest. Such statutory duties arise, ofcourse, not only under the various Socialisation Acts, but also under section 27and section 69 (4) of the National Insurance Act, 1946.The Council have already had assurances that the Government has imposedno embargo on the Boards of socialised industries in discussing claims for pensionsand in their view there is no reason why the discussion of such schemes shouldnot proceed side by side with the work of the committee.We hope that, in the circumstances which I have set out, the General council will see their way to co-operate in the enquiry. The Government are proceeding with the establishment of the committee, but will not appoint two members torepresent the standpoint of industrial workers until they have received the views ofthe Council on possible names to these appointments.APPENDIX draft EXPLANATORY memorandum. The conception of supplementary pensions is a new one. It is only sincethe National Insurance Act came into operation in 1948 that it is really possible to speak of supplementary pensions. Previous pension schemes were for the mostpart intended, apart from personal savings, as the whole provision for the old ageof those entitled to them, and the national scheme was originally developed to fill the gaps left by employment pension arrangements already in existence. By and large those industries or groups which had pension schemes were especially excludedfrom the national scheme.2. The National Insurance Act, 1946, made an entirely new approach to theproblem of provision for old age. Its aim was to ensure for everybody in thecountry the opportunity of an adequate insurance pension payable as of right afterwork ceased. It was further envisaged that groups and individuals who could afford it would, with this basis secure, make further provision against their retire-ment, either by way of personal savings or insurance policies or through group* Reproduced as Appendix B.
pension schemes. Provision was accordingly made in the Act on the one hand notonly for Government assistance in the establishment of supplementary pension schemes (section 27), but also for adapting or winding up pension provisions already made, to take account of the future national pension (section 69 (4)).3. This latter provision emphasises that any provision of pension must now take full account not only of the benefits of the national scheme but of thecontributions required to maintain the national scheme. There must always be largeclasses of people for whom the national scheme must remain the only provisionother than personal savings and the like. It would be wrong if the contributionsrequired from workers or employers in sectional schemes proved an obstacle to theproper development of the national scheme. It would also be wrong if the workersin basic industries enjoying a monopoly were able to secure specially favourablesupplementary benefits which had to be paid for by other workers, less favourablyplaced, in the form of increased prices for basic services.4. In the past pensionable employment has been bound up with the ideaof security of employment and has been sought not merely for its provision for old age but as an insurance against unemployment during working life. Full employ-ment calls for a reconsideration of this aspect of industrial pension provision, andespecially the possible effect which such schemes may have on that degree ofmobility of labour which is essential if we are to maintain full employment. It isimportant that there should be enquiry into the possibilities of making employmentpension rights interchangeable, either generally or in particular groupings. this involves consideration of the extent to which pension schemes should be financed by employers.5. Pension schemes differ from wages and other conditions of employmentin that they involve long-term commitments. The worker must be assured of what he may expect in old age in return for the contributions which he and his employerare paying now. It is important that there should be full examination of the wholequestion of the security of pension funds and the best way of securing that schemesremain actuarially solvent. It is believed that there are a number of existing schemes which are not actuarially solvent. In this field it is particularly important to considerthe effect of possible changes in the value of money and the increasing longevityof the population.6. The public at large are becoming aware of the grave problems for thenational economy as a whole which arise from increasing longevity unaccompaniedby equivalent extensions of working life. Changes in the retirement pension pro-visions of the National Insurance scheme made by the recent Act and the debates in Parliament in connection therewith have focused attention on these problems.The retirement provisions of the National Insurance scheme will be frustrated if other pension provisions and industrial practices are not adjusted to achieve thesame broad needs of national policy. While there must be every sympathy withthe desire for a better standard of living in retirement, it must be made clear toall concerned that such a standard of living can only be met out of the goods and services produced by the workers at the time the pension is required. Unless,therefore, the total burden on the economy can be kept within reasonable compass,e.g., by modification of pensionable ages, the expectations of those now asked tocontribute both for the national pension and for additional pensions may be disappointed irt one way or another.7. If it is accepted that there must be extensions of working life the question will immediately arise whether a general extension is possible as envisaged in therecent changes in the National Insurance scheme, or whether there are occupationsrequiring exceptional treatment; and this must in turn lead to consideration of the pension arrangements to be made in such cases.8. Consideration must also be given to the international aspects of the pensionarrangements made by this country. We are becoming more and more closelybound up with other nations through reciprocity arrangements and international conventions, and it is important that if we cannot fall in with the ideas of other friendly nations we should be able to explain and justify our own policy.
