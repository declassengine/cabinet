THIS DOCUMENT-IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential cp. (51) 201 COPY NO, 3112TH JULY, 1951CABINETSALARIES AND EXPENSES OF SCOTTISH JUDGESMemorandum by the J-lord AdvocateI refer to the memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer onthe above subject (CP. (51) 199).   I have considered proposals contained therein, and, while I agree that increases in salary for the judicial officers concerned are justified, I am unfortunately not able to agree with all of theChancellor of the Exchequers proposals in relation to the Scottish Judges.I accordingly set out alternative proposals, which I put forward for theconsideration of my colleagues.2. I am in agreement with the proposals of the Chancellor of theExchequer in relation to judicial expenses, as set out in paragraphs 6(b)and (c) of his memorandum, subject to the proviso that I do not consider thatthe allowance proposed for High Court Judges in Scotland is sufficient.   Theproposal is that a reasonable allowance, such as is paid to members of royal commissions, would be justified.   The standard allowance on this basis is,I understand, 3 0s. a night&apos;.   While it is true that the Scottish Judges are notinvolved in the same degree of ceremonial and hospitality as the EnglishJudges, they are obliged to live on circuit on a standard compatible with theirhigh judicial office and are involved in a certain amount of hospitality.Considering that an English Judge on circuit receives by way of allowances 7.10s. a day for subsistence of himself and clerk and subsistence and travelof any servants he may take with him, and  2. 2s. a day for subsistence andtravel of his Marshal, if he takes him, I suggest that it is quite inadequate to offer Scottish High Court Judges on circuit subsistence allowance at therate of 30s. a night.3.       (a) The result of the Chancellor of the Exchequers proposals isas follows:-Present New       SalarySalary (a) (b)Initially    After five yearsCounty Court judge -^ 2,000  2,750  3,000Metropolitan magistrate  2,000  2,500  2,750Chief Metropolitan magistrate  2,300  2,750  3,000Sheriff-Substitute Grade C  1,400  1,850  2,10011              &quot;              &quot;     B  1,700  2,150  2,400&quot;              &quot;              &quot;     A  1,900  2,350  2,600Chairman of Land Court  2,200  2,680  2,900Sheriff Principal - Lanark  2,400  2,850  3,100Sheriff Principal - Lothians  2,200  2,650  2,900and Peeblesj6   excluding fees for divorce cases.
(b) i am satisfied that it is no longer possible to defend thepayment to the Sheriffs-Substitute in categories A and B x (cf. footnote)of a lower salary than is paid to County Court Judges and, incidentally, tothe Metropolitan Magistrates,   It is true that this is the present position,though, as a result of the fixing of an inclusive salary for the County court judges, the gap would, under the Chancellor&apos;s proposal, appear to be wider.But the Sheriffs-Substitute have for long represented, with strong support in Parliament and elsewhere, that the differentiation is unjustifiable andI am satisfied that they are right.   I accordingly propose that the Sheriffs-Substitute in categories A and B should be given the same salary as theCounty Court Judges;  and that consequential adjustments should be made inthe salaries of the full-time Sheriffs and She riffs-Substitute in category Cand of the Chairman of the Scottish Land Court.(c) There is no&apos; doubt that the jurisdiction of the Sheriff-Substitute is much wider than that of the County Court Judge and I have noreason to think that in the case of categories A and 3 his burden of work is any lighter.(d) Unlike the County Court, the Sheriff Court in Scotland hasalmost co-ordinate jurisdiction with the High Court (i. e. the Court of session) in all civil cases.   For practical purposes the only jurisdictionwhich is excluded from the Sheriff Court is jurisdiction in actions affectingstatus, of which, of course, the common example is divorce.   On the otherhand, in actions of separation and aliment between husband and wife, whichare competent in the Sheriff Court and which are usually taken there,Sheriffs-Substitute are called upon to adjudicate on exactly the same issues as would be found in divorce actions, for example, adultery, cruelty, etc.In other spheres, unlike the County Court, there is no limitation on thevalue of the cases which may be taken in the Sheriff Court, and I have knownactions involving many thousands of pounds to take place in this Court.   Twoexamples within my own experience leap to my mind, where in one casethe sum involved was  80, ,00, and in the other  26,000.   In the criminalsphere the Sheriff-Substitute deals with all the cases taken under the SummarvJurisdiction Act, with the exception of minor cases which are taken in thePolice Court and the J.P. Court.   Moreover, more serious criminal casestaken on indictment can be taken in the Sheriff Court, but the maximum sen-tence which can be imposed is one of two years&apos; imprisonment.   The resultof this is that cases which are too serious for summary jurisdictionproceedings, but not sufficiently serious to warrant the case being takento the High Court of 3&apos;usticiary, are taken by the Sheriff-Substitute sitting witha Jury.   The She riff-Substitute is also called upon to hold fatal accidentinquiries which may be ordered, and accordingly approximates, to a certain extent, to the Coroner in England.   He also conducts bankruptcy proceedings,and has a multitude of other functions which he may be called upon to perform,such as hearing petitions for and objections to the registration of clubs,and determining whether or not there should be an extension of leases underthe Tenancy of Shops (Scotland) Act, 19.9.   I narrate these duties, not asa catalogue of all the duties which he is called upon to perform, but to illustrate the more important duties.   It is against this background that i submit that the question of the appropriate salary for a Sheriff-Substituteshould be considered.   It will be observed that he fulfils in one man andfor one salary the combined duties and responsibilities of several judicialofficers in England.x    At present Sheriffs-Substitute are graded in three categories accordingto the location of the Courts:  viz. A Glasgow, B Edinburgh,Aberdeen, Dundee and other more populous areas, and C the more remote and less populous areas.
(e) I propose that the Sheriffs in categories A and B should infuture be paid the same salary because I do not feel that the difference in theburden of their duties is any longer material and that this salary should beon a par with that of a County Court Judge.   In the case of category C I agreethat the-work is lighter and I propose to advise the Secretary of State asvacancies occur to consider the merging or reorganisation of some of theShe riff-Substitute districts in this category so as to reduce the total numberof posts.   In this category I propose that the salary should be approximatelyin the same ratio to the other categories as it is at present.   The salaries of the two full-time Sheriffs and the Chairman of the Land Court should inmy opinion be slightly higher than that of the highest paid Sheriff-Substitutewithout necessarily involving a proportionate increase.Against this background I wish to comment on the reasons set outby the Chancellor of the Exchequer in paragraph 13 of his memorandum foropposing the request for parity with County Court Judges for Sheriffs-Substitute -(a) While it is true that the judicial systems of the two countries arenot alike, and the responsibilities cannot be shown in all respectsequal, it is, I submit, clear from the foregoing paragraphs on aShe riff-Substitute &apos;s duties that his responsibilities are con-siderably greater than those of a County Court Judge.   Cn thequestion of retiring pensions, the position is as follows.A County Court Judge becomes entitled to a pension after fiveyears1 service of one-third of his salary, which becomesprogressively greater each year until he completes fifteen years&apos;service, when he is entitled to a pension of two-thirds of his salary.Cn the other hand, a Cheriff-Gubstitute only becomes entitled to apension after the completion of ten years1 service, when he receivesa pension of one-third of his salary.   After fifteen years&apos; service a Sheriff-Substitute qualifies for a pension of two-thirds of his salary, and after twenty years&apos; service to a pension of three-quarters of his salary.   In both cases these fractions are subjectto the modifications imposed by the recent Administration ofJustice (Pensions) Act, 1951.   It will thus be seen that, althoughthe Sheriff-Substitute reaches a greater maximum fraction aftercompleting twenty years&apos; service, he does not qualify for a pensionas soon as the County Court Judge, nor does his pension riseprogressively from year to year.   At the end of the day, therefore,there is not much, if any, difference between the pension rights ofthe respective Judges.(b) I do not consider it a good argument that judicial salaries inEngland and Scotland should now be fixed in relation to the incomesmade by the candidates in private practice.   Like the LordChancellor, I have had great difficulty in the past in attractingsuitable candidates for new positions, as the more experiencedmembers of the Bar are unwilling to exchange a lucrative private practice for the salaries which are at present being paid.   Inany event this principle is not recognised either in the CivilService or in the nationalised industries, except in so far asprovincial differentials may be taken into account.(c) I would not propose that the Sheriff of Lanark, the most highly paid Sheriff, should have his salary increased to  3,500 a year.I would propose that his salary should be equated to that of theother full-time Sheriff, namely, the Sheriff of the Lothians, andthe Chairman of the Land Court, and be fixed at a figure of, say,
 3,200 a year, thus maintaining a wider differential between these salaries and the present salaries of the Scottish High court judges than the Chancellor of the Exchequer contemplates.   Inthis connection I should point out that, while the Scottish HighCourt Judges may very well persist in the claim which they havebeen making over a considerable period for increases in salary,I do not ask at this stage for the salaries of the Scottish HighCourt Judges to be brought into line with those of the EnglishHigh Court Judges.   All that I put forward was a reservation ofour right to claim parity for Scottish High Court Judges, if andwhen the question of increases of salary for High Court judges in general came to-be considered.5. The financial difference between the Chancellor of the Exchequersproposals and mine is in the order of  20,000 a year, covering the fiftyJudges involved.I accordingly submit for the consideration of my colleagues -that Sheriffs-Substitute in categories A and 3 should be placedon the same salary basis as County Court Judges;that Sheriffs-Substitute in category C should receive aproportionately increased salary;that the salaries of the full-time Sheriffs and the Chairman of theLand Court should be equated at a rate slightly in excess of thehighest paid Sheriff-Substitute; andthat the circuit expenses of the Scottish High Court Judges shouldbe on a substantially higher scale than the proposed scale.J. V/.(a)(b)(c)(d)Lord Advocate&apos;s Department, S.W.I. ,12TH JULY, 1951.
