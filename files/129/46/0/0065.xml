&apos; f(THIS J^OCUJEKT^ * S GOVERNMENT ICONFIDENTIALC.K(51 )215 COPY NO.    3 119TH JULY. 1951CABINETTHE MAfr-KS7ER POSITION GN THE BRITISH RAILWAYSMemorandum by the Minister of TransportMy colleagues will be aware that there have been serious difficulties in the movement of freight trafficthroughout the first half of this 5rear.      The british transport Commission are convinced after very full examinationof the problem that the most serious and persistent factor isthe acute shortage in certain essential grades of railwayoperating staff.      With my support, they recently asked theMinister of Labour and National Service to defer for 12months from 11th July, 1951? the call-up under the NationalService Acts of certain railwaymen at places where acutedifficulties are occurring or are anticipated.2.      The total number for whom deferment is thus sought isabout 2,900.      This figure is made up of firemen (1,162)  the promotion grades for firemen, guards, shunters and signalmen(1,62+5) and permanent way signal and telegraph maintenancestaff (69).3o      The Minister of Labour and National Service has not found it possible to agree to this proposal, and, as aresult, the Chairman of the British Transport commission has sent me a memorandum, of which I attach a copy, preparedby the Railway Executive, assessing the rail traffic position for the coming winter.1+.      The memorandum forecasts a serious state of affairs,and the Chairman of the British Transport Commission assuresme that the Railway Executive have not exaggerated theposition.      He is most anxious, and I share his anxiety tothe full.5.      I must ask,  therefore,  that my colleagues should review&quot;the position, and I would urge that the limited measures of deferment asked for should be granted as a necessary expedient.With regard to the other proposal in paragraphs 27-30 of theCommission&apos;s memorandum, which briefly is that railwaymencalled tip should, after basic training, be returned to therailways on reserve, my view is that this should be further examined to see whether by this means the needs both of theService Departments and of the railways could reasonably be met.A. B.Ministry of Transport, S.W. 1.19TH JULY, 1951.
ANNEXASSESSMENT OF WINTER 1951/52 RAIL TRAFFICPOSITION IN VIE?/ OF STAFF SHORTAGEMemorandum by the Railway Executive1.      In considering the rail transport prospects for next winter, cognisance must &quot;be taken of the experiences in thewinter of 1950/51,    During this period, the chronic staffshortages caused serious interference with the movement oftraffic, particularly through key junctions and in heavyindustrial areas.    Serious disruption of rail traffic wasaverted only &quot;by special measures such as the working,mainly &quot;by operating and motive power staff, of excessiveovertime, including Sundays and rest days0    Despite these special steps it was necessary to decline acceptance oftraffic for certain routes and to impose severe loadingrestrictionsj these have operated in varying degrees up toJune.20      The heavier traffic accumulations necessitating therestrictions were in the North and East Midlands awaitingacceptance through various junctions for destinations in theWest Midlands, South Wales and the West country; also inSouth Wales for destinations in England.    In addition therewere persistent difficulties in the movement of exchangetraffic via the London Junctions.    The areas of congestionwere predominantly those where the man-power situation was particularly serious,3o      This interference with the normal flow of freightimperilled production at a number of important works, causeddelays to ships and evoked strong representations andcomplaints from trade and industry, through Parliament,Ministries, Trade and Commerce Chambers and associations and individual traders^he     Although during the past winter priority was given inthe supply of wagons to collieries and movement of coal -which represents nearly 60 per cent of the total tonnageconveyed &quot;by rail - operating difficulties on Railways dueto the staff shortages nevertheless reacted on coal production to the extent of a loss in production of 151?500 tons of deep-mined and open-cast coal, while over 1^26,000 tons ofcoal hod to he stocked^,    This, it is understood, in somecases involved withdrawal of men from the coal face and,apart from the waste of man-power, entailed heavy expense.5*      This position obtained despite the diversion by theNational Coal Board of over 100,000 tons per week to road -involving waste of petrol and man-power as compared withtrain load movement by rail- and switches by arrangements with national Coal Board of coal supplies by rail to alternativedestinations to avoid use of congested routes,6.     Fluid railway working is absolutely indispensable to coal production.    Non-availability of empty wagonsimmediately reacts on production, and any impairment ofwagon mobility, loaded or empty, because of shortage ofrailway staff must imperil coal output.
7o     While in previous winters various operating difficulties,due to abnormal weather, have been experienced, these have always been overcome by Easter,    The disturbing feature isthat, although fluidity has been restored generally for thetime being, movement problems still exist because of staffshortages - and this despite the cessation of collieryworking on Saturdays, and severe restriction of passengertrain services,.    This is quite unprecedented and emphasises the seriousness of the situation.8.     But the problem becomes even more acute as the prospects for the ensuing winter are examined because, with a staffposition likely to be even more serious, the Railways will becalled upon to convey increased traffics,9*     An appreciation of the anticipated originatingtonnage to be carried by rail during 30 weeks commencing1st October, 1951, compared with the corresponding period1950/51. shows that traffic will probably increase asfollowss-d70Coal Class 3*30 Computed in association with National Coal Boardproduction estimate.Mineral and k0l6 Includes increased carryingMerchandise of home-produced Iron ore,etc0General Merchanise     099 Includes timber, etc0In this connection it should not be overlooked that in 1950freight net ton-miles totalled 22,135,000,000 compared with16,672,000,000 in 1938s an increase of 32B7 per cent.10.    The anticipated increase in coal traffic alone to be conveyed by rail represents over 3 million tons, and thegreater proportion of this output is expected to arise in coal divisions where railway staff difficulties are mostpronounced, e.g0 -IncreasedTonsEast Midlands 7*2 per cent 3 1^,677,500West Midlands h*5 per cent - 328,600South Western ho5 per cent 646,90011.    In regard to the staff situation there were clearindications d\iring the latter half of 1950 of a driftof labour from the railways and, equally, of areluctance on the part of young men to come into theservice.    In the key footplate grades there were on theestablishment, in March, 1950, 9k,813 men; by Decemberthe figure had been reduced to 92,363o    In March of thisyear the corresponding figure was 89,9k5 and at theend of this summer It is expected the figure will havefallen to 88,605; unless this trend is arrested the wastage will be even more pronounced next winter whenincreased traffic is anticipated.
12,    Unfortunately the picture has been just as blackwith other key operating grades.    Total figures for goodsguards^ signalmen and goods shunters at the three datesmentioned above were 63, 7h6, 6T, 525 and 60,082,respectively, and the number expected at the end of the summer will be 59,595,13,    On the Civil Engineering side the wastage has followed similar lines.    In this case the loss has beer-apparent for a longer period.   Prom January 19h8, to march 1951, the total loss of conciliation and workshopgrades was 13,861 men and if the rate continues thefigure by March next year will be in the region of 19,000men, upwards of 23 per cent, of the strength in January,19k8.The non-availability of staff to keep the permanent way in proper condition necessitated in June, 1950, theimposition of lh additional speed restrictions.    By June,1951? this had increased to 2i8,    Related to the anticipatedsteff position it T/bill be necessary to increase thenumber of restrictions throughout the autumn and winter toabout 70e    These speed restrictions will be a further and serious hindrance to the fluid movement of traffic,Iho    The position with the conciliation and workshop staffresponsible for maintenance of Signalling and telecommunications has been equally serious.    There hasbeen an increasing demand in outside industry for theservices of these skilled men.    The net wastage since january, I9I4.8, to date is 991? and if the trend continuesthe figure will have grown to approximately l,h00 by march of next year, representing 12 per cent of thisspecialised staffs15o    There will be a marked seasonal upsurge in traffic(particularly coal.) in early September as other industriesget back to normal working, coupled with the furtheranticipated increases throughout the whole winter, referredto earlier,    The increase in sickness during the winter months must also be taken into account^ together with the inevitable slowing down in operations due to bad weather and shorter hours of daylight,16,    It is in the light of these facts and trends thatthe capacity of the railways to move traffic in thecoming autumn and winter must be considered,,    Shortlyexpressed,, the prospective position is that with a diminishing &quot;key&quot; operating staff, at present employedunder conditions of good weather and long hours ofdaylight, the Railways will be expected to carryappreciably increased traffic, representing over 10,000wagons per week more than last winter?s demands of733,000 wagons per week,17,    These staff losses, again, are most likely to be concentrated mainly in those areas to which reference has already been made, and in those areas fluidmovement of railway traffic will be in serious jeopardyunless the staff position is radically improved immediately,as time must be allowed for training.    The effect willbe felt particularly at those junctions and in thoselocalities where free rail movement is of the utmost importance both to the general industrial life of thecountry and to the rearmament drive.
18. Whilst priority for movement of particular traffics,e. g., coal and steel and kindred traffics - which representapproximately 76 per cent of the tonnage carried by rail - maybe possible for short periods to relieve a difficult operatingsituation, the application of restrictions on the remaining 2aper cent., either completely or partially for any extended timebecause of staff shortages, would undoubtedly cause serious location in the movement of traffic essential to the life ofthe nation, especially bearing in mind that this proportionincludes such commodities as -Conveyed annually by railTonsPood and drinks (human and animal 12,000,000consumption) including perish-ables, vegetables, etc.Petrol 3,000,000Building and Road Making Materials 11,000,000Timber, including that for mining 3,000,000purposes1 9. There are also serious operating objections to themaintenance of priorities for specific traffics,,     Fluidity of movement is dependent in considerable measure upon a balancedflow over the running lines and through yards and junctions.Any process of selection, if continued, upsets the balance of movement and reduces the effective use of men and engines.20. The Railway Executive are of course continuing toexamine intensively every possible measure to improve the staffposition by a special recruitment drive, including greateremployment of women, improved lodging arrangements and allowances, re-employment of retired staff, endeavours to obtainstaff from Eire, Northern Ireland and Northern Italy, and ineen-tive schemes for train crews and permanent way staff.     Dis-cussions are taking place with the railway trade unions regard-ing a proposed I4.8 hour week;    an appeal to the staff to work aweek of their annual leave and other proposals designed toassist the situation.21. Other measures to facilitate working being takendomestically, and in collaboration with traders, include a close and continual review of wagon and train loading arrangements,directional flows and re-routing of traffic, accelerated wagondischarge, etc.      In addition the Railway Executive are examining with the Road Haulage and Docks &amp; Inland WaterwaysExecutives every possible scope for assistance, both temporary and in pursuance of integration policy, likely to affordassistance to the railway system dttring next winter.22* Steps taken to cut the passenger train schedules andto adjust the summer train service will be known, and it isanticipated that the mileage for winter services 1951/32 willbe approximately 3* 5% less than for the corresponding period1950/51.     There is now under consideration by the railway executive a proposed scheme of still further cuts in the winterpassenger service.23. It should be emphasised that the approach to theGovernment to defer railwaymen in black areas was made only after a very careful appraisal of the general situation and because there is a real risk of dislocation and even breakdown in rail transport next winter, with all its inevitable conse-queno.es.to the nat ion.
2k&apos; There is already a considerable physical strain on&quot;key&quot; staff working long hours, e.g.  shunters, train crews,permanent way and signalling and telecommunications men.Such a position cannot conduce to the attractiveness of railwayemployment when compared with conditions obtaining in otherindustries, and must inevitably result in increased absenteeismthrough sickness.25. In discussions with important trading organisations,the Central Consultative Committee and the trade unions, whoare aware of the serious nature of the railway staff problem,there is strong support in any representations to secureimprovement in the railway staff in &quot;black&quot; areas.26. The Commission feel that the grounds for the request for deferment (not exemption) of certain key grades in certainplaces vital to railv/ay operation are fully justified in thelight of the foregoing.27. There is, however, a further alternative which theCommission wish to submit for examination, and that is thatrailwaymen called up should, after basic training, be returnedto the railways on reserve.      It is suggested that arrangements could be made which would provide for the War Office a reserve of properly trained railwaymen which would be available in theevent of a possible emergency, and at the same time would render some assistance to the present railv/ay position arisingfrom the shortage of operating grades.28. These objectives would be achieved, by giving to the railwaymen in these grades who are due for call-up under theNational Service Act an opportunity to accept a posting to theRailway Training Centre at Longmoor for a limited period of, say,11+ days&apos; military training in general military principles and tobe fitted with the necessary personal equipment.      Following thisperiod they would then be postponed to a Supplementary ReserveRailway Operating Unit and would be returned to their presentrailway work fov so long as they remain in the service ofBritish Railways.29* The effect of this would be that the Railway Executivewould take the responsibility of giving such men their necee-s ary  railway training.      It is appreciated that in the eventof an emergency arising they would be liable to immediate call-up and would join the Supplementary Reserve Unit to which theywere posted.      It might well be that this call-up would takeplace over a period cf time dependent upon the extent to whichthe taking charge of lines of communication became necessary from the military point of view.30. In the event of any men concerned leaving the railwayservice, either compulsorily or voluntarily, their names wouldbe reported to the military authorities by the Railv/ay Executivewith a view to their being called up to complete their service in any unit other than a Railway Unit as may be required.During their two years&apos; national service these RailwayReservists would be expected to move to any point to which theymight be posted for the purposed of continuing their railwayemployment and railway training.16th July. 1951*
