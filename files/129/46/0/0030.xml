(51) 18026th June, 1951CABINETJAPANESE WAR criminals memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 31st May (CM. (51) 39th conclusions, minute 2) the Cabinet invited meto investigate a report that 200 Japanese held in British hands for war crimes wereto be handed over to the Japanese Government for trial.2. After investigation it appears that there are no Japanese prisoners still being held in British hands for war crimes but who have not yet been tried. Thereport, therefore, should&apos; be regarded as unfounded.3. It may have been derived from a press message of 3rd May to the effectthat the Hong Kong Government were negotiating with the Supreme Commander,Allied Powers, for the repatriation of convicted Japanese war criminals in HongKong whose prison sentences had not yet been completed. It is true that negotia-tions to this effect have been taking place; and with the agreement of the supreme commander, the seventy convicted war criminals who were in Hong Kong havealready reached Japan.H. M.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,26th June, 1951.40791
