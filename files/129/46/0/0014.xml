SCHUMAN TREATY: ALLIED CONTROL OF GERMANHEAVY industry memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in C.P.(51) 147 I put before my colleagues the problem of thefuture of existing Allied controls over German heavy industry in the lightof the Schuman Treaty.    It will be recalled that the French are anxiousto issue a public statement that, as the Schuman Treaty comes into effect,existing Allied controls should be abolished; the principal object of such astatement would be to facilitate the ratification of the Schuman Treaty in theGerman Federal Parliament.    My colleagues invited me on 5th June(C.M.(51) 40th Conclusions, Minute 2) to discuss with the Minister of Supply&quot;whether a further attempt could not be made to assure ourselves of adequate supplies of semi-finished steel from Germany before we agreed in principle that the existing Allied controls over the German coal andsteel industries should be abandoned as soon as the Schuman Treaty came into effective operation&quot;.2, The Minister of Supply and myself have in consequence reconsideredthe problem of the future of existing Allied controls.    We agree that it isimportant at the present juncture to take every opportunity of ensuringessential raw material supplies from Germany for British defence indus-tries.  It is proving increasingly difficult to get adequate supplies of scrapor of semi-finished steel products from the Germans, either under currenttrade negotiations or under the general guarantee given by the federal chancellor to the High Commissioners in March, 1951, to the effect that&quot;the Federal Government will co-operate in the equitable apportionment ofmaterials, products and services which are or may be in short supply or required for the common defence&quot;.3. At the same time I regard it as important to determine as soon aspossible what line we shall take about the future of existing Allied controls,since the French and United States Governments have for some time nowbeen pressing us to send a representative to a further conference on thesubject, and are particularly anxious to open discussions early in the week beginning 17th June.4. I recommend to my colleagues that the Foreign Office should send a representative to discussions at Paris as proposed by the French, and thathe should be empowered to agree (or to recommend to Governments) that existing controls over German heavy industry should be abolished (as recommended in C.P.(5l) 147), when the appropriate machinery under the schuman Treaty comes into operation, subject however to the importantcondition that the needs of the British defence industry for German rawmaterials (i, e. scrap and semi-finished steel products) are from now onwards adequately met.IrJHS DOCUMENT-IS THE-PROPERTY-OF-HIS BRITANNIC MA-^ ESTY^S GO V-ERNMENT-)secret.P.C51) 164 COPY NO.

5. This condition can be fulfilled in two ways:-(i)     The Governments concerned can issue a joint declaration that existing controls over German heavy industry will be abolishedat the appropriate time, subject to adequate fulfilment by theGermans of the guarantee on &quot;equitable apportionment&quot; givenby the Federal Chancellor in March, 1951 (see paragraph above).(ii)     We can join with the other Governments concerned in issuing ajoint declaration of principle about the abolition of existingAllied controls, and simultaneously make a unilateral declara-tion both to the other Occupying Powers and to the Germans thatwe will, after ratification of the Schuman Treaty, only confirmour agreement to the abolition of controls if our defence needsare being adequately met under the &quot;equitable apportionmentguarantee&quot;.A joint declaration by all Governments concerned, as envisaged in (i) above,would probably carry more weight with the Germans, but could hardly bephrased so as to cover our defence needs alone and would therefore have more general application.    A unilateral declaration, as envisaged in (ii)above, might be less binding but would have more specific application toour vital needs.6. I invite my colleagues to endorse the recommendation of paragraph4 above and to express their opinion on which of the two methods suggestedin the preceding paragraph would be more suitable for the attainment ofour objective.H.M.Foreign Office, S.W.1,15TH JUNE, 1951.
