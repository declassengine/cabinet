V    61DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GO /ERNMENT)SECRETCP. ,51&apos;) 160 COPY NOv18TH JUNE, 1951CABINETECONOMIC AID FOR YUGOSLAVIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs at their meeting on 5th April (C.M.(51) 24th Conclusions, Minute 4)the Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Foreign Secretary and thePresident of the Board of Trade recommending further economic aid to yugoslavia.The Cabinet -(1)    Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make availableto Yugoslavia a further credit of  4 millions, on the same terms as the earlier credit of  5 millions, for the purchase of rawmaterials.(2)    Invited the Foreign Secretary, when informing the yugoslav government of this further credit, to warn them that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would not be able to continue thiseconomic assistance unless they were satisfied that the yugoslav government were determined to balance their foreign payments in the near future and were adopting policies calculated to bringabout that result.Paragraph 4 of C.P.\5.V) 98 forecast that in the light of discussions with the Americans at the official level about Yugoslav current accountdifficulties and of an interim report just received from our economic mission at Belgrade, further proposals involving substantial credits or grants to Yugoslavia would have to be put before the Cabinet.2. Shortly after the formal discussions began between American andBritish officials on 9th April, French officials joined in at the request of theFrench Government.    This action on the part of the French was important as hitherto they had not been willing to take part in economic aid to Yugoslavia.The three delegations reached agreement on 13th June on all the main points of a tripartite policy of economic assistance towards Yugoslavia and have adopted a report for submission to their  respective   Governments.    Acopy of this document is attached.    The recommendations are summarised -at the beginning of the report and in the present paper I only wish to stresscertain salient points.3. The delegations based their study on the assumption that it was inthe interest of the Western World generally to &quot;keep Tito afloat&quot; (paragraph1).    It may therefore be opportune to tabulate some of the advantages whichthe continued existence of an independent and relatively stable Yugoslaviaconfers upon the West.
4. Yugoslavia has a well-trained Army of more than thirtydivisions which can confidently be expected to fight if attacked, and whichis hardly lil^ely to remain indefinitely inactive in the event of a general warin Europe.    Yugoslavia is an example and an encouragement to anti-Stalinist Communists on both sides of the Iron Curtain.    In so far as itsrecent history proves that there are reasonable prospects for a CommunistState to thrive without the protection of the Soviet Union, to live in harmony with its Western neightbours, and even to accept capitalist economic assistance without sacrificing its independence, Yugoslavia has become abeacon for world peace.    These are the positive arguments.    But the negative arguments are little less telling.    If Marshal Tito&apos;s rdgimewere to collapse, Italy would immediately find herself in the front line,the flanks of Greece and australian &amp;a would be turned, the Soviet Union would gain a great moral victory, which it would not hesitate to exploit by everypropaganda method, and the anti-Stalinist forces in the world would besensibly weakened.5. The proposals now made by the three delegations have the great advantage of representing an agreed and co-ordinated approach to theproblem of &quot;keeping Tito afloat&quot;.    In the past, as my colleagues will remember, the question of aid to Yugoslavia has been dealt with piece-meal whenever His Majesty&apos;s Government or the United States Governmentwere confronted by urgent requests by the Yugoslavs for aid.    An integral part of the programme, moreover, is that other countries should be invited by the United Kingdom, United States and France to offer economic assistanceto Yugoslavia, if only by agreeing not to press for payment of Yugoslavindebtedness (paragraphs 27-31).6. It is to be emphasised that the total cost of this plan of assistancecannot be known with any certainty in advance.    The figure of  44. millions ,paragraph 11 of the report) for the eighteen months ending 30thJune, 1952 (after allowing for money already put up), is the best estimate that can be made in present circumstances.    Paragraph 9 of the reporttherefore provides that if it seems likely that the Yugoslav Government will need substantially more than  44. 6 millions during the period now underconsideration, any of the three Governments may ass for the plan ofassistance to be reconsidered.    On the other hand, the estimated amountwill not be spent if it proves more than the Yugoslav Government actuallyneed.    No consideration has yet been given to the period after 30th ..une,1952, as it is impossible to forecast so far in advance.7. It is proposed in paragraph 8 of the report that assistance shouldbe given in the form of grants.    Hitherto, United Kingdom assistance hasbeen in the form of credits, but in view of the amount of debt which the yugoslav Government have incurred in the recent past ^paragraph 5 of therexiort), and of the impossibility of foreseeing when they will even begin to repay existing debts, I trust that my colleagues will agree that it is onlysensible for further assistance to be in grants.    I understand that the UnitedStates and French officials have already obtained approval of their ministers for the principle of giving assistance by way of grants.o. In the same paragraph of the report it is proposed that the UnitedKingdom should bear 23 per cent, the United States 65 per cent, and France12 per cent of the uncovered Yugoslav deficit.     I have already obtained theChancellor&apos;s agreement to this percentage for the United Kingdom.    Thethree delegations have also proposed (paragraph 13) that each Governmentshould either arrange for postponement of, or provide cash to meet, debtpayments which would normally fall due to be paid by Yugoslavia to their
respective countries during the eighteen-month period ,e.g. nationalisa-tion compensation payments).    It has  been agreed by the delegations thatin most cases postponment is undesirable or impracticable.    Themaximum total to be put up by His Majesty&apos;s Government without further review of the tripartite plan, including the debt payments, will be about 12 millions, of which about  10 millions would fall within the present financial year ending 31st March, 1952.9. I understand that the best and speediest method of obtainingParliamentary sanction for a grant of  10 millions would be to ask earlyin July for a supplementary estimate on the Foreign Office vote.    Theremaining  2 millions would need Parliamentary sanction at the beginningof the next financial year.    I do not expect very much parliamentary opposition in this connection, more particularly as this is a tripartiteoperation.    Recent questions from both sides of the House lead me tothink that there is considerable sympathy for, and awareness of, Yugo-slavie^s economic difficulties.    Indeed, I have already been under somepressure to ma^e known more details of the proposed plan of assistance,news of which leaked to the Press in Washington some weeks ago.10. It is particularly important that the United . ingdom&apos;s help, ifgiven, should be available as soon as possible.    This is because the UnitedStates Government, owing to a constitutional difficulty,   may not be able toenter into new financial commitments to Yugoslavia in advance on thepassing by Congress of the new foreign assistance bill which is now underconsideration.    Many United States goods will still be awaiting delivery to yugoslavia on 20th June, but it is most important that the Yugoslav Govern-ment should not be compelled, for want of funds, to interrupt seriouslytheir placing of orders for minimum requirements during the period before which the Americans can blocks new commitments, which they hope will notbe later than September.    I therefore propose, when communicating to theUnited States Government the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government, toexpress my concern at the implications of any undue delay before their share of assistance can be made available, since it is clearly desirable for the Yugoslavs to have at their disposal dollars as well as sterling andfrancs, and for all three countries to keep in step so far as possible in ajoint operation of this kind.11. If Parliamentary sanction is sought and given for grants of  10millions to be made available to Yugoslavia, I should not wish to imply that the implementation of the plan outlined in the report will be easy orsuccess certain.    The British Economic Mission to Belgrade, who, togetherwith H.M. Ambassador, will be responsible for carrying out the Britishside of the tripartite operation, and their opposite numbers in the UnitedStates and French Embassies in Belgrade, will require to use great care in handling the programme with the Yugoslavs.    Although recent indicationsshow that the latter are now taking steps to help themselves by emphasising the importance of increasing their export earnings, these efforts alone maynot prove sufficient.    Paragraph 21 of the report therefore makes it clearthat the Yugoslavs would be left in no doubt that continuance of assistance by the three Governments would depend on how far they were satisfiedthat the Yugoslavs were in fact taldng measures designed to balance theirpayments.    The British Economic Mission have so far found the Yugoslavsmost co-operative, and there is every reason to hope that this co-operation will continue.
at12, Recommendations.  I accordingly propose to my colleagues:-(1)    that the Tripartite Report and its recommendations for actionbe approved;\2)    that I be authorised to seek Parliamentary sanction for theUnited kingdom to contribute to the joint programme a sumof  10 millions for the current financial year, on the lines set out in paragraph 7.H.M.Foreign Office, S.W.1,18TH ;.UNE, 1551.

366SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDED action the action which it is proposed that the participating Governments should takeis summarised as follows, without prejudice to the full text. of the relevent para-graphs of this report.   The participating Governments should:  (a) Accept responsibility for providing grants to finance Yugoslavia^ balanceof payments deficit up to 30th June, 1952 in the manner, and within thelimits, indicated in paragraphs 8 to 10.(b) Agree to the postponement of payments^ including interest payments, on all of Yugoslavia^ external debts with fixed repayment dates, subject to review and revision of repayment schedules, in the manner proposed inparagraph 13.(c) Confer without delay in Washington about Yugoslavia^ extraordinaryimports for defence purposes of common-use items as indicated inparagraph 12.(d) Minimise the amount of assistance which will be required, by seekingremedial action by the Yugoslav Government with regard to investment and production, as outlined in paragraphs 14 to 16 and by applying themeasures mentioned in paragraph 20.(e) When they have reached agreement on the plan of assistance, give the yugoslav Government an idea of the character of the plan, and seektheir co-operation, in the manner indicated in paragraphs 19 and 29,leaving them in no doubt about the condition mentioned in paragraph 21and requesting the required assurances, including an assurance that theinformation mentioned in paragraphs 22 and 23 will be provided.(/) Comply with any request from the IBRD for general information about theplan of assistance when it has been agreed.(g) In co-operation with the Yugoslav Government where desirable,- approachother NATO countries, Germany, Austria and certain other non-NATOcountries, in the manner indicated in paragraphs 27 to 31, to seek their agreement to postponement of debt payments and the provision by them of grant assistance.(h) Afford assistance in meeting Yugoslav import requirements of goods in short supply as indicated in paragraph 25.(/) Maintain close liaison with one another, and with the IBRD, through theirrepresentatives in Belgrade and otherwise, as indicated in paragraphs26 and 38.introduction. &apos; This report has been prepared on the assumption that it is of great politicaland military importance to the United Kingdom, the United States, France andthe Western World generally to maintain the advantages which the existence of anindependent Yugoslavia outside the Soviet orbit confers upon the West, and toavoid the consequences which a collapse of the Tito regime and of Yugoslavresistance to the U.S.S.R. would entail. The attainment of this objective is threatened by the present economic situation of Yugoslavia, to alleviate which thereport sets out a plan of assistance.2. Before the last war Yugoslavia was a poor country and, generally speaking,its material and human resources were not used to the best advantage. In recentyears these resources have been adversely affected by the destruction during thewar, the inadequacy of incentives, especially in agriculture, the lack of competentmanagers, technicians and skilled labour, the dislocations caused by the Cominformblockade, including the necessity of a switch of trade to the West, the drought of1950, and the adverse movement in the terms of trade. At the same time largedemands have been made on these resources for the consumption needs of a population which is growing and becoming more urban in character, for the militaryprogramme, and for the investment programme which the regime considers tobe both ideologically and politically important.. These demands have proved greaterthan Yugoslavia^ ability to produce, and the Yugoslav Government have found the resources necessary for fulfilling their investment and military programmes on
the present scale only by keeping consumption down to a dangerously low leveland by obtaining foreign assistance. This position appears to have been aggravated by the Yugoslav Governments not having applied available resources in such away as to yield the greatest possible total return in domestic production or foreign exchange within the shortest time, and also by their having pressed on with certainprojects the effectiveness of which now waits upon the completion of other projects.3. Since 1948 Yugoslavia has had a balance of payments deficit of very seriousproportions and the Yugoslav Government has requested financial assistance from certain Western States and international organisations. Bearing in mind the greatimportance to themselves of Yugoslavia^ continued political and economic inde-pendence of the U.S.S:R., the Governments of the United Kingdom, the UnitedStates and France extended assistance to the Yugoslav Government by creditsand grants amounting to  17 million,*  43-2 million and  1-4 million respectivelyup to the end of 1950. This assistance, however, did not solve the Yugoslavpayments problem.4. Yugoslavia continued to run a deficit on current trading account andcontracted a substantial burden of debt, not only to those countries which hadextended medium and long-term loans, but also, in the form of &quot; swings &quot; andoverdrafts, to a number of other countries. Furthermore, the international monetary Fund had in 1949 permitted the Yugoslav Government to obtain 32 million against dinars, and the International Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment (IBRD) made a loan of  1 - 0 million for timber-equipment.5. Excluding the pre-war bonded debt on which settlements were to be negotiated, Yugoslavia^ external debt obligations at the end of 1950 totalled 65 million (see Appendix A). The order of magnitude of this figure is seen by comparing it with Yugoslav exports in 1949, which were  68-5 million.Prospective Yugoslav Deficit6. The statistical conclusions set out in the following paragraphs are based on examination of separate studies of the prospective Yugoslav balance of payments for 1951 and 1952, previously made by the United States and United kingdom governments. These studies were founded partly on actual figures of Yugoslavia^balance of payments in past years, and partly on the Yugoslav Governmentsestimates for 1951 and 1952 as appropriately adjusted. In view of the limitedinformation available they are to be treated as no more than the best basis at thepresent time for taking necessary action and are liable to substantial correction inthe light of further information. The period of eighteen months ending 30th June,1952, has been taken as a suitable period for estimating the Yugoslav deficit atthis time.7. In Appendix B Yugoslavia^ deficit on ordinary trade for the eighteen-month period is estimated at  48 million. In addition to ordinary trade two types of imports are required by Yugoslavia during the same period. These are food imports necessitated by the 1950 drought, valued at  22 - 2 million, and extraordinaryimports for defence purposes of goods capable of being used either for defence purposes or other purposes (in this report called &quot; common-use items &quot;), valued ona very tentative estimate at  17-9 million. Yugoslavia^ current trade deficit forthe period, defined as including the food imports but not the extraordinary importsof common-use items, is estimated at  69 - 6 million. Towards covering this currenttrade deficit, sums totalling  50 million have already been made available to Yugo-slavia, and details are given in Appendix C. For the extraordinary imports ofcommon-use items no foreign assistance has been specifically given. The figuresjust mentioned relate only to Yugoslavia^ trading on current account. following the Yugoslav Governments practice they exclude all but minor imports of capital goods. They also exclude any provision for the contractual external debt payments due by Yugoslavia in the period, totalling  6-5 million, and any payments inreduction of Yugoslavia^ &quot; swings&quot; or overdrafts on trading account which amounted at 1st January, 1951, to about  24-2 million. Details of these liabilitiesare given in Appendices A and D.* In this report all amounts are expressed in pounds sterling regardless of the currencies actuallyinvolved.
Proposals concerning Provisions of Funds8, It is proposed that the Governments of the United States, the UnitedKingdom and France (in this report called &quot; the participating Governments &quot;)should accept responsibility towards one another for providing by way of grant tothe Yugoslav Government, in the proportions of 65 per cent, by the United StatesGovernment 23 per cent, by the United Kingdom Government and 12 per cent, bythe French Government, the funds necessary to meet :(i) that portion of the Yugoslav current trade deficit for the period 1st January,1951, to 30th June, 1952, which is not covered by the credits and grantsset forth in Appendix C or by any other sums that may be madeavailable to Yugoslavia for use in that period; and(ii) Yugoslavia^ payments in the same period in respect of extraordinaryimports for defence purposes of common-use items; and(iii) Yugoslavia^ payments in the same period in respect of the timber-equipment loan made by the IBRD in 1949; and(iv) other payments which, in spite of all that the participating Governments- can do to the contrary, may for a variety of reasons be made by Yugo-slavia during the same period and enter into her total balance ofpayments deficit for that period.9. The responsibility proposed in the preceding paragraph should not howeverextend to providing the funds necessary to meet any amount by which the totalYugoslav balance of payments deficit for the period exceeds  94 - 6 million.Should it appear at any time to any participating Government that such an excessis likely, the participating Governments should at the request of that Governmentconfer with a view to deciding on any measures which should be taken, includingpossible modification of the plan of assistance and of their responsibilities towardsone another. The participating Governments should in any event keep the Yugo-slav economic situation under continuous appraisal, with particular reference tothe prospective total balance of payments deficit for the period, and should exchangeinformation and views upon it.10. The responsibility proposed in paragraph 8 should not be construed asextending ^o the provision of funds directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying Yugoslavia with equipment utilisable only for military purposes (militaryend-items).11. Appendix E. shows the funds which each of the participating Govern-ments would provide in accordance with the preceding paragraphs on the assump-tion that the total Yugoslav balance of payments deficit for the period was  94 - million, and that the funds available from other sources towards meeting it were those already known and shown in Appendix C, amounting to  50 million.12. As only a very rough estimate is available of the value of Yugoslavia^extraordinary imports for defence purposes of common-use items, it is proposedthat the participating Governments confer without delay in Washington with aview to making a better estimate of the value of such imports in the light of whatis available and what Yugoslavia needs.Proposals concerning Yugoslav External Debts13. It is proposed that Yugoslavia^ external debts, whether due to participa-ting countries or to other countries, should be dealt with as follows:  (a) Payments, including interest payments, due on all Yugoslavia^ externaldebts with fixed repayment dates* (including compensation payments)should be postponed. Alternatively, if the Government of any creditorcountry should consider an alteration of the contractual terms asimpracticable, or for any other reason should so wish, such Govern-ment may abstain from postponing payments by Yugoslavia, whilsttaking such payments into account by adequately increasing its share ofassistance.* The French delegation reserves the right of its Government to raise with the other participating governments the question whether this provision should apply to payments on the pre-war externalbonded debt due to private persons or whether such payments should be considered as part of thecurrent Yugoslav deficit.
(b) Five years from 1st January, 1951 would seem to be a suitable period of postponement of these debts but the three particpating governments should keep the situation constantly under review, in consulation withthe Governments of other countries concerned, in the hope that thisperiod may be reduced.id) In cases in which the Government of any country decides not to postpone-the payment of any debt due to that country, but instead to increase its assistance to Yugoslavia by an adequate amount, that Governmentshould continue to do so during the period of postponement.id) Before the end of the period of postponement Yugoslavia^ capacity to repay its external debts should be reviewed. Yugoslavia^ external debtrepayment schedules should be revised along the lines of Appendix Funless review by the participating Governments prove some otherschedule to be more feasible,ie) The above sub-paragraphs should apply also to debts on &quot;swings&quot; andoverdrafts. In the case of any such debt, the Government of thecountry should agree that its amount (i) shall not on any 1st January inthe period of postponement be less than it was on 1st January, 1951, and(ii) shall not at any time during the period of postponement either exceedor fall short of its amount on 1st January, 1951, except in so far as is justified by normal seasonal trading fluctuations.The Basic Economic Problem14. It is desirable to adopt an orderly approach to the problem of Yugoslavia^economic situation and to minimise the amount of assistance which will be requiredin the future. - The assistance proposed in the preceding paragraphs should accordingly be supplemented by measures to ensure its effectiveness and to improve the basic conditions of the Yugoslav economy described in paragraph 2. It is clearthat domestic demand should be reduced and production increased as far aspossible.15. As regards domestic demand, civilian consumption standards are low andprobably could not be cut further without endangering the stability of the regime.The military programme is outside the scope of the present report. Therefore, the investment programme appears to be the only aspect of the demand side whichoffers the possibility of effecting remedial action. While it is understood that some progress in securing desirable modifications has been made by the IBRD, further steps in this- direction are likely to be required.16. An increase in production could be achieved in three ways. Through a programme of training, the competence of managers, technicians and skilled labourcould be improved and their numbers increased. Some capital expansion would alsoincrease production^ as would the giving of greater incentives to the population by changes in the regulations concerning purchasing, rationing, prices and taxation.These measures are of particular importance in agriculture. It is understood thatthe Yugoslavs are now making some progress along these lines.Relations with Yugoslav Government17. In order that the assistance which the participating Governments extend to Yugoslavia shall achieve as far as possible their objectives it is necessary toco-ordinate procedure and to obtain certain measures of co-operation on the partof the Yugoslav Government. &apos;18. On the other hand, it must be remembered that the Yugoslavs are proudof their independence. The Tito regime is devoted to its own Marxist ideology, iswary of Western pressure and foreign interference, but has not shown reluctance indealing with international organisations of which it is a member. The delicateposition of the Yugoslav Government, both internally and in relation to theCominform countries will have to be borne in mind in implementing the particularproposals of. the participating Governments. Though the Yugoslav Government^relations with the West are changing in the direction of greater co-operation, itwould be a mistake to press the Yugoslav Government so hard as to endanger the achievement of the objectives of the participating Governments. In the circum-stances it is difficult and perhaps undesirable to make a hard and fast assessmentat this stage of how far the objectives will be achieved, and the participating governments will have to proceed by trial and error.
, 19. For the practical success of the plan of assistance co-operation by the yugoslavs is indispensable. Though the main lines of the plan will have been previously agreed by the participating Governments, it should be presented to the yugoslav Government in such a way as to avoid giving the impression that itis cut and dried. A number of changes, which may be necessary to meet objections,can be made so long as the plan is not altered substantially. The aim shouldbe that the Yugoslav Government should agree in principle to the plan and. in factadhere to it later.20. The, participating Governments have three types of direct control readily available; supervision of expenditure of funds provided, controls over their exports to Yugoslavia, and the handling of supply assistance. They may also require certain commitments from the Yugoslav Government as pre-requisites tothe granting of assistance. Beyond this limited sphere the participating Govern-ments will have to rely on influencing the Yugoslav authorities by giving advice.They should seek to establish an atmosphere of mutual confidence in which the yugoslav authorities will be receptive to such advice.21. The Yugoslav Government must be left in no doubt that continuanceof assistance by the participating Governments. depends on how far they aresatisfied that the Yugoslav Government are taking measures to balance their foreign payments as soon as possible. Satisfactory assurances may be required from the Yugoslav Government of their determination to take such measures.22. In connexion with paragraphs 20 and 21 the Yugoslav Government should provide such pertinent information as is necessary to enable the participating governments to evaluate and review on a continuing basis the amounts and types of economic assistance to be extended. In general, this information is of the typecommonly published by other Governments, and is indicated in Appendix G. the exact form in which the information should be requested from the yugoslav government can be determined only after full discussion with them as to whatis practicable, but the highest priority should be given to foreign trade and pay-ments data. From time to time the Yugoslav Government should also providethe participating Governments with projections of production, consumption and balance of payments statistics.23. Non-statistical information which is desirable includes descriptions ofcapital projects and progress on them, texts of trade and financial agreements andarrangements with other countries, and important changes in economic policy organisation.24. Periodic review of Yugoslavia^ current needs and decisions on the alloca-tion and release of funds should provide a means of control. The mechanismfor releasing funds and the periods for which the Yugoslav Government shouldbe promised assistance will need to be worked out in the light of the fiscal and legislative procedure of each of the participating countries, but as far as possiblethe participating Governments should observe the principles of maintaining controlof their own expenditure and at the same time giving the Yugoslav Governmentsufficient assurances to permit planning.25. With regard to goods in short supply, the participating governments should afford whatever assistance is appropriate in meeting Yugoslav import requirements, both in the administration of their domestic controls and in inter-national discussions on allocations. As indicated in paragraph 20, the provisionof such assistance in specific instances would, of course, be another way of influencing Yugoslav co-operation in carrying out the plan of economic assistance.26. The setting up of a joint Mission of the participating Governments would raise great administrative and possibly legal difficulties. Each of the participating governments will have representatives in Belgrade dealing with the Yugoslavs, inorder to observe the utilisation of imports which those Governments have financedand also to offer advice on ways and means of achieving viability. These repre-sentatives should maintain close liaison with a view to exchanging information andviews. They should also avoid unnecessary duplication of effort, unnecessary burdens on the Yugoslav authorities and divergence in the advice which they give. the participating Governments should consult with One another whenever a request forassistance is made by the Yugoslav Government to any one of them. Any informa-tion provided by the Yugoslav Government should be checked as far as possible
by the participating Governments. In particular, statistics established by the par-participating Governments relating to trade between their countries and Yugoslaviashould be exchanged as regularly as possible.Co-operation of other Governments27. It is desirable to have as many Governments as possible, in addition to the participating Governments, associated with the plan of assistance, each making its maximum contribution and co-operating in the necessary arrangements. Non-participating Governments should accordingly be approached by the participating governments, but only after the latter have reached agreement on the plan, and inaccordance with a suitable time schedule;28. The Governments of other N.A.T. countries have a common political interest with the participating Governments in assisting Yugoslavia, and generalagreement has already been reached by the N.A.T. deputies on policy towardsYugoslavia. On the other hand, it is desirable to avoid the appearance that economic assistance to Yugoslavia has become a responsibility of N.A.T.O. In these circum-stances it is proposed that the participating Governments should use N.A.T.O.channels to request other N.A.T. Governments to extend economic assistance to yugoslavia. The request should stress policy considerations and should be ingeneral terms. It should, however, indicate that the participating Governmentsintend to follow it up with separate approaches through the diplomatic channel toascertain the particular measures of assistance which each country will undertakeand to discuss arrangements for co-ordination between the different countries.29. The participating Governments&apos; presentation of the plan to the yugoslav government in accordance with paragraph 19 should begin concurrently with theproposed approach through N.A.T.O. channels, and the Yugoslav Governmentshould be told that the plan entails their requesting assistance from other Govern-ments and that the participating Governments will wish to discuss in the near future the arrangements for doing this. The Yugoslav Government should not be told ofthe participating Governments&apos; request through N.A.T.O. channels but a short period of time should be allowed for action to be taken on the request made tothe Council Deputies. Thereafter discussions between the participating Govern-ments and the Yugoslav Government should take place with respect to the yugoslav Government^ requests to other countries, which should be arranged soas to permit the supporting diplomatic approaches by the participating governments to be as effective as possible. As soon as the arrangements with the yugoslav government are completed the participating Governments should make theirapproaches to other N.A.T. Governments in the manner already indicated.30. The participating Governments should also suggest that the yugoslav government approach the Governments of other countries to which it is indebtedrequesting the postponement of debt payments or equivalent action. The partici-pating Governments should indicate that they would give diplomatic support tosuch requests. In making their supporting representations to those governments which are not members of N.A.T.O. and whose principal reason for contributingwould not be political, the participating Governments should emphasise that theco-operation of all Yugoslavia^ creditors is necessary to bring order into Yugo-slavia&apos;s economic situation, to preserve their existing investment in Yugoslavia andto make possible the continuance of trade with that country.30a. The situations of Western Germany and that of Austria, which differboth irom those of other non-participating countries and between themselves, ,seemto call for individual treatment. The political considerations are somewhat similarto those affecting the N.A.T.O. countries, but the participating Governments have in Germany and Austria a position of greater and more direct responsibility, andthere are additional factors such as the Austrian Government^ relationships withthe occupying Powers. After necessary consultation the participating Govern-ments, acting through such channels as are found to be appropriate, should agree on means of urging the Federal German Government and the Austrian Governmentto do their part in the commqn effort to assist Yugoslavia, suggesting the specific measures necessary.31. While working out with the Yugoslav Government the necessary arrangements and procedure by which the assistance extended can be made most effective, the participating Governments should discuss these matters with the other
Governments associated with the plan of assistance. In particular these otherGovernments should be asked to co-operate by affording whatever assistance is appropriate in meeting Yugoslav import requirements Of goods in short supply, by not exporting capital equipment to Yugoslavia except as may be agreed, and byexchanging pertinent data with the participating Governments on their trade andfinancial arrangements with Yugoslavia.Relations with International Bank for Reconstruction and Development32. The economic assistance over the eighteen-month period should be, inso far as possible, harmonious with any longer-term programme, including capital development, directed toward making it possible for Yugoslavia in due course to achieve economic viability, as measured by its independence of extraordinaryforeign assistance and its standard of living Since the IBRD was known to be considering the Yugoslav Governments request for a development loan, inquirieswere addressed to the IBRD on this subject. In order to reply to these inquiries,two members of the staff of the IBRD were present in London for a series ofconsultative meetings with the three delegations.-&apos; 33. At these meetings the representatives of the IBRD stated that a favour-able decision by the Bank on loans to Yugoslavia was subject to certain changesin the Yugoslav investment programme, access to the 18 per cent, capitalsubscriptions of certain European member Governments, a satisfactory settlementof Yugoslavia^ outstanding external indebtedness, and satisfactory assurances thatYugoslavia^ current account deficit would be met without increasing Yugoslavia^debt burden. They stated that the IBRD was interested in the outcome of the tripartite discussions, since the decisions of the participating Governments aboutaiding Yugoslavia were directly connected with these conditions for loans by theIBRD.34. In the course of the consultation with the representatives of the IBRDthere was general discussion on the estimate of Yugoslavia^ current deficit, the magnitude of Yugoslavia^ burden of external debt, Yugoslavia^ chances of reaching equilibrium in its balance of payments, the character of the IBRD&apos;sprojected loan programme for Yugoslavia, and the problem of co-ordinating the participating Governments assistance-with any IBRD loan programme. The Bankestimated that at average 1950 prices the Yugoslav deficit in 1951 and 1952 togetherwould be  35-45 million of which 75 per cent, would be attributable to 1951. they expected to see a substantial improvement in the Yugoslav short-term situation in1952 compared with 1951, and they expected that the current trading account should be balanced by the beginning of 1953, provided that assistance in themeantime were made available on a grant basis, as they considered it should be.35. The&apos;representatives of the IBRD stated that the Bank staff were atpresent concerned with the first two tranches ( 9-9 million and  10-8 million respectively) of a loan programme of approximately  71-5 million dating from 1stSeptember 1950 and including the German, Austrian and Belgian loans totalling 21-1 million negotiated since that date. The figure of  71-5 million was based ontheir investigation of the Yugoslav economic situation which also led to the con-clusion that, given this loan programme, Yugoslavia would from 1956 be able topay a maximum of  9-11 million annually for all external debt service, includingthe service of any IBRD loan. As the existing contractual position of Yugoslavexternal indebtedness (Appendix H) requires payments far in excess of this maximumin the next few years, excluding pre-war debts, a tentative schedule of repaymentswas prepared by the three delegations and the IBRD representatives on the assump-tion that most of the debts were funded over fifteen years from 1956 at 4-J per cent,per annum. This schedule, corrected, in a few details, is given in Appendix I: it shows payments in 1956 totalling  16-3 million, an amount still in excess of theIBRD view of Yugoslavia^ ability to pay. In these circumstances the IBRDrepresentatives considered that they could not properly make any suggestions asto what the participating Governments should do, but that if the IBRD loan wereto go ahead something would have to be done about the liabilities in respect of present external debts. After careful consideration the three delegations reiteratedto the IBRD representatives the importance which they attached to the making bythe IBRD of loans to Yugoslavia and of their wish that the Bank should participatewith them in helping the Yugoslavs to balance their foreign payments, but stated&apos;that they had not at that time been able to give adequate consideration to that
part of their plan dealing with Yugoslavia^ present external debt. They agreed,however, that the schedule of debt payments (Appendix I) would require modifica-tion in order to reduce the burden on Yugoslavia and that they would make recom-mendations to their Governments to take steps in this direction, (see paragraph 13.); 36. The IBRD representatives, were asked whether they could take over ona long-term basis the German, Austrian and Belgian loans already negotiated, andalso miscellaneous items of capital equipment which are included by the yugoslav government in the current trading account. They expressed grave doubts aboutthe former, as refinancing was against the Bank&apos;s normal practice, but did not definitely exclude the possibility. The latter would depend on the Bank&apos;s judgment of the specific projects to which the items applied.37. In response to a number of specific questions put by the representatives-of the IBRD, the three delegations informally stated the following as their jointviews: (a) Yugoslavia should receive assistance in covering its current deficit andshould be assisted to carry out an investment programme directed to the strengthen-ing of its productive capacity and the elimination of that deficit, (b) Yugoslavia^current deficit in the period 1st January, 1951, to 30th June, 1952 (excluding food imports, the import of capital equipment and the extraordinary import of militaryend items and of common-use items for defence) at prices ruling early in 1951, wouldbe about  48 million, (c) The three delegations hoped that as a result of actionresulting from their deliberations, including action taken by Yugoslavia, the deficitwould decrease. (d)On economic and political grounds Yugoslavia^ current deficitshould, if possible, be covered by grants, although certain delegations had not thencompleted their exploration of the practical possibilities of their Governments-giving aid in this form (see paragraph 8). (e) Yugoslavia^ imports of capital equipment should be financed on terms similar to those on which the IBRDgenerally finances such imports. (/) Co-ordination of short-term current assistance and the programme of investment loans is of the greatest importance.38. In the light of these discussions, it is desirable that when the plan ofassistance has been agreed, the participating Governments should comply with anyrequest from the IBRD for general information about it. Close liaison should alsobe maintained between the participating Governments and the IBRD in connectionwith the IBRD&apos;s long-term loan programme.
