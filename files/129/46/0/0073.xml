CL*circulated*j jl  4-/7 (S-trzu^-    36*[THIS-DOCUMENT- IS-T-HE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y &apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential cp.(51) 223 COPY NO. g j23RD JULY, 1951CABINETTHE MAN-POWER POSITION ON THE BRITISH RAILWAYSMemorandum by the Minister of defence with his paper (CP.(51) 215) the Minister of Transport enclosesa memorandum by the Railway Executive setting out the serious position ofthe British Railways with regard to man-power.    The one positive proposal which appears to be made in this memorandum is that about 3,000 men inkey grades on the railways should be deferred from call-up to nationalservice in the Armed Forces.    The Minister of Transport endorses thisproposal and invites the Ca.binet to approve it.2. I strongly support the Minister of Labour&apos;s argumexits against this proposal (CP.(51) 219).    With the removal of the general defermentof agricultural workers this autumn, the mining industry will be the onlyindustry whose employees as a whole are deferred from military service.To defer these railway operatives would be a dangerous breach of thegeneral principle of universality of liability to national service.3. I am also deeply concerned with the effect which the grant of deferment to these railwaymen, and the likely consequences of extension toother hard-pressed industries, would have on the man-pov/er of the armed forces.    The Forces are themselves a key occupation of vital importanceto the future existence of this country and are seriously deficient of man-power.    Last February I stated in the course of the Defence debate that bythe end of the present financial year the  numbers of men serving full-timein the Forces would be approaching 900,000.     In the last week or two it hasbecome clear that the strength of the Forces is unlikely to reach more than about 860,000 by April next.    One of the main reasons for this shortfall onfigures essential to the build-up of our forces is the deficiency of numbersavailable for call-up.     This is due to a number of reasons which theMinister of Labour can expound better than I.    But the fact remains thatthe National Service Acts are now failing to supply the numbers which theServices require in addition to their regular components, and it would bein my view most unwise for the Cabinet still further to add to this deficitby opening the door to deferment of men in industries which happen forthe time being to be hard-pressed for men.    It seems to me, too, that ifthese railwaymen are deferred from military service, the farmers - whoare, 1 understand, a little restive under the decision to remove the generaldeferment from agricultural workers - may well take courage again in thehope of reversing or modifying that decision.4. I am readyto agree with the Minister of Transport that the&quot;further alternative&quot; described in paragraphs 27 to 30 of the memorandumby the Railway Executive should be examined in detail.    So far as I havebeen able to ascertain in the short time available, the Service departments are unlikely to regard this alternative proposal as acceptable, but they will
examine it as a matter of urgency.    I would here add that so far as Iam aware, there has been no approach at the official level by theMinistry of Transport to my Ministry or the Service Departments onthe proposals in the memorandum of the Railway Executive, and I feelthat such consultation ought to have taken place before such a contro-versial matter was brought before the Cabinet.5. In his paper the Minister of Labour has pointed out that the drain away from the railways has at any rate for the present been arrested.    I cannot believe that to divert some 3,000 railwaymen, whoat the age of 18 cannot have attained any high degree of skill or occupyreally pivotal posts, from the general call-up would have a benefit tothe railways proportionate to the serious harm it would do to theForces, and I ask my colleagues to reject the Minister of Transporfsproposal.6. I feel bound to add that it seems to be becoming almost amatter of habit for every important industry which is undermanned to claim, as its first remedy, the withholding of its personnel from national service.    The mining industry is already exempted from com-pulsory military service;  and a current scheme is operating wherebymen of the regular Forces can volunteer, if they have had a certain minimum amount of previous mining experience, to go back to the mines.The Services have lost appreciable numbers of already trained and valuable men through that scheme.    I realise that for a key industryconfronted by a serious shortage of man-power it may well be the lineof least resistance to suggest that their employees should be reservedor deferred from national service.      I dos however, suggest that it isquite wrong in principle to try to meet our difficulties by removing orwithholding men from the armed forces whose strength we are pledged to increase.    If now we are to defer men employed by the british railways because of shortages of staff on the railways, I am quite sure that the Government will be faced with a series of demands for defer-ments from national service, which will in sum have a most serious effect on the strength of the Forces,E.S.Ministry of Defence, S.W.1,23RD JULY, 1951.
