&apos;    26?.I IIS  DOCUMENT   IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GQVERNMEN 1Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1951SECRET Copy No. 3 1CP. (51) 20316th July, 1951CABINETSERVICE RETIRED PAY AND pensions memorandum by the Minister of defence the scales of retired pay and pensions of the armed forces, unlike those of theCivil Service, bear no settled relation to&apos; pay, but the reasons which lead to a reviewof effective emoluments are usually also relevant in regard to non-effective benefits,and in the annex to the memorandum which I submitted to the Cabinet on10th August, 1950, CP. (50) 190, I mentioned that service retired pay and pensionscodes were being reviewed and that in my view it would be necessary to make substantial improvements in this field if we were to continue to attract the right typeof man to follow a service career.2. Discussions have accordingly been proceeding at the official level withthe Treasury in the course of which substantial progress has been made in settling the details of the new rates of retired pay and pensions. As foreshadowed in my memorandum of 10th August, 1950, part of the new non-effective codes will be inthe form of a lump sum payable on retirement or discharge to pension.3. Revised scales of pensions and the lump sums for other ranks have nowbeen agreed with the Treasury. Particulars of these scales are set out in Annex A.4. So far I have been unable to persuade the Chancellor of the exchequer to accept the whole of my proposals for officers.5. The Chancellor considers that the lump sum which after careful considera-tion my service colleagues and I proposed at a flat rate of not less than  1,500 forall officers irrespective of rank should not exceed  1,000.6. The Chancellor also wishes to reduce the rates of retired pay proposed bythe Service Departments from those shown in column (3) (a) of Annex B to those shown in column (4) (a). The reduced lump sum of  1,000 converted into an annualsum from the Government Annuity Tables has been added to these two sets ofrates in columns (3) (c) and (4) (c).7. The reductions proposed by the Chancellor would cut the Service Depart-ments&apos; rates by amounts up to  100 per annum in the retired pay scale and  500in the lump sum. I understand that the Chancellor bases his proposals on the viewthat the new rates of retired pay ought not, when added to the lump sum expressed as an annuity, to bear a higher ratio to the 1950 pay rates than that borne by the1946 retired pay rates to the 1946 pay rates. I cannot accept this basis for deter-mining improvements in retired pay. It is not related to the problem we have to solve, which is how to get more men of high quality to join the Services and make a career as officers. To have this effect the increases in retired pay must be significantand in addition to the lump sum. Further, I am apprehensive lest the increases proposed by the Chancellor, which are less than those recently accruing to senior civil servants as an automatic consequence of the Chorley salary revision, may giverise to the criticism that the armed forces are once again being treated as&quot; Cinderellas.&quot; The services required a new deal and the pay increases of last september and the new non-effective code must appear as such.8. I must impress upon the Cabinet that the result of approving the ratessuggested by the Chancellor would be as far-reaching as it would be unfortunate.Great importance is attached by those responsible for service recruitment to creating a favourable impression with the new rates. The promulgation of rates open to serious criticism will certainly do harm.40914
9. I am disappointed that the Chancellor has not accepted  1,500 as the lump sum for officers. This is by no means an excessive sum for the State to contribute towards an officers resettlement expenses on retirement having regard to the factthat officers nowadays seldom have private means. I accept, however, that a cut in the proposed lump sum would do less harm than a cut in the proposed rates of retired pay. I am therefore (reluctantly) prepared to accept the smaller lump sum,provided the rates of retired pay set out in column (3) (a) of Annex B are approved.I recommend that the Cabinet should approve these rates.10. In the course of the negotiations the Chancellor indicated his preference for a different scheme of improvement in service non-effective benefits under whichthere would be no increase in retired pay over the 1946 rates but a higher range oflump sum payments, the amount of which would depend on rank. Such a scheme would not be acceptable to the Service Departments and is therefore not discussed in this paper.11. I ask the Cabinet to agree that the rates of retired pay for officers shoiildbe as set out in column (3) (a) of Annex B, and to authorise me to make an early announcement in Parliament covering the new non-effective code as a whole.E.
