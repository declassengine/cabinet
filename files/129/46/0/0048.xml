IS DOCUMENT IS THE PRGPER-T-Y-OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENT-)confidential cp. (51) 198 COP&quot;, NO. 31UTH jULY, 1951CABINET   &quot;BAMANGWATO AFFAIRS - TSHEKEDI dHAMAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth RelationsDuring the. debate in the House of Commons on the 26th June,on the motion seeding Tshekedi ^Jiama&apos;s return to the bamangwato reserve, I undertook on behalf of the Government to invite the Bamangwatotribe to hold a further kgotla as soon as possible to determine their viewson the question whether Tshe.;edi, having renounced all claim to the chieftainship, should be allowed to return to the Reserve as a privateindividual.   I also expressed willingness to arrange that two or three members of Parliament should attend the Kgotla as observers.   I furtherexpressed the hope that Tshe edi .hama and his followers would be  .present at the kgotla to state their case, but pointed out that as native lawand custom are involved, the tribal leaders would have to be consulted.2. The Opposition parties have declined to send members oftheir parties to the Protectorate.   In the present Parliamentary situation it is therefore impracticable to send M.Ps.   The Prime Ministeraccordingly authorised me to invite two or three persons of repute andstanding to go to Bechuanaland and be present as observers during the preparations for and the holding of the kgotla.   The following have agreedto go -Mr. H.L. Bullock, lately of General and Municipal WorkersTrade Union;Mr. D.L. Lipson, Member of Gloucestershire CountyCouncil and ex-M. P. for Cheltenham;  and professor W.M. Macmillan, Director of Colonial Studies,University of St. Andrews.3. I hope to arrange for this party of observers to arrive inBechuanaland by air in about fourteen days.   I propose that immediately on the arrival of the observers in the Bamangwato Reserve, and in their presence, the High Commissioner and his officers should have a meeting with tribal leaders who should be as representative as possible.  At thismeeting the High Commissioner, assisted by the observers, will do their utmost to persuade the Bamangwato to summon a Kgotla and to agree tothe attendance at it of Tshekedi and his followers.   They will male itclear that Tshekedi has renounced all claims to the chieftainship.   If theagreement of the tribal leaders is obtained a kgotla will then be held about three weeks later.   A fortnight is the minimum time necessary to summon a kgotla.   Tshekedi has asked for a month.   I think three weeks is aboutright.
4. It is impossible to forecast how the tribal leaders willreact to these proposals.   I have therefore instructed the High Com-missioner that he must ensure that he has the backing of the observersin any action which he takes and that he must not take any decisionexcept to call a kgotla at which Tshekedi and his followers will be present with tribal agreement) without consulting me and reporting theobservers&apos; views.    If the observers strongly recommended that theproposed kgotla could not be held without serious danger cf disorderor grave damage to the tribe, we might have to consider alternatives:I am discussing possible alternatives with the High Commissioner.5. I am informing Tshekedi, who has put a variety of questions to me in letters, that I cannot allow him to enter the Reserve untildecisions have been taken about the proposed kgotla, but that my intention is that from the date on which the decision to hold a kgotla istaken until it is held he should be at liberty to be in the Reserve.   In thepresent state of tribal feeling I think it would be too great a risk to allowTshekedi in before a decision about the kgotla has been taken.   Moreover,it would greatly reduce the chance of securing from the tribal leaders afavourable decision about holding a kgotla.   I am suggesting to him that hewould be well advised to arrange his arrival in the Protectorate about thesame time as the observers so that his entry into the Reserve is not delayed.I am also telling him that the exclusion order which must be renewed on his arrival in the Protectorate will be suspended to enable his entry into theReserve.   In view of recent events in Serowe I am advising him that weare still considering the arrangements that may have to be made for hisown personal security while in the Reserve and that I will let him havedetails about these later.6. To summarise, I propose to take the following action to implement the undertakings given during the Parliamentary debate onthe 25th June :-,1/ To send a party of independent observers to Bechuanalandby air in about a fortnight&apos;s time to be present asobservers during the preparations for and the holding ofthe proposed kgotla.(2) The High Commissioner to arrange a meeting with triballeaders in the presence of the observers to seek to persuade the Bamangwato to summon a kgotla and toagree to the attendance at it of Tshekedi and his followers;and to arrange, if their agreement is obtained, for a kgotlato be held about three weeks later..3 No decisions in regard to the kgotla will be taken whichhave not got the full backing of the observers.If favourable decisions are taken, to allow Tshekedi back inthe Reserve from the date on which it is decided to hold akgotla until it is held;  for this purpose the exclusion order which must be renewed on his return to the Protectoratewill be suspended.
(5)&quot; To take such action as may be necessary, e.g. byreinforcement of the police etc. , to maintain good order, protect Tshekedi and his followers and ensure afair hearing for all.   It may be necessary to call on police reserves from Southern Rhodesia - though hope we can get enough from the other two high commission Territories.7. I should be glad to-have Cabinet authority to proceed onthese lines and to make a brief announcement in reply to a parliamentary question on Thursday, 12th July, giving the names of the observersselected to go to Bechuanaland and attend the kgotla.P.C.G-W.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.
