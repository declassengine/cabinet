I -US   DOCUMENT   IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1951CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.3 c.p.. (51) 20918th July, 1951CABINETDENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS: FINANCIAL  assistance memorandum by the Minister of EducationIntroductionAt their meeting on 10th May (CM. (51) 35th Conclusions, Minute 6) theCabinet invited me to submit to them my proposals for giving more financial aid to the denominational schools. I have discussed these proposals with the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer, who will put his own point of view orally to the Cabinet.2. The Roman Catholics have never accepted the 1944 settlement in the same way as the other denominations. Since, for reasons of conscience, they&quot; are unwilling that any of their schools should become &quot; controlled &quot;* (in which eventthey would be relieved of the entire cost of maintenance) they have, as a conditionof securing, and preserving, aided status* for their schools, to find half the cost ofany necessary alterations and of repairs to the exterior. They regard this as an unfair burden, more particularly since costs have risen far more than was expected in 1944. They also regard it as inequitable that they should have to meet the entirecost of entirely new schools, except in so far as these replace one or more existingRoman Catholic school or cater for pupils &quot; displaced &quot; from other Roman Catholicschools (see paragraph 7 below).3. The Church of England, though exercised about the financial implications of aided status (about a third of their schools have opted, or are likely to opt, forthis alternative), are even more disturbed by the extent to which their controlledschools, and especially the smaller village schools, are threatened with extinction.4. I have done what I can by administrative action to meet the denominations&apos;legitimate claims. It is clear, however, that no substantial relief can be providedwithout amending legislation.5. I should not. regard it as practicable to make fundamental alterations inthe 1944 settlement. Moreover, while any alteration of the existing law, if it isto be of any real help to the denominations, must mean departing to some extentfrom the underlying principle of the settlement, namely that grant should not bepaid on the provision of new denominational schools where that means an additionto the existing provision, to depart far from that principle would seriously impair the chances of obtaining the agreement of the other interests concerned and increasethe risk of controversy.6. For these reasons I could not endorse the proposals which have recentlybeen canvassed by certain members of the Party. There are, however, two changesin the law which I think would help the denominations. The first is an amendmentof Section 104 of the Education Act, 1944, which would benefit mainly the roman catholics, the second, an amendment of Section 1 of the Education Act, 1946,which would assist the Church of England.* A controlled school is a voluntary school in which the Local Education Authority is responsiblefor the cost of structural improvements and the upkeep of the premises and, subject to the reservation of certain rights to the managers or governors, for the appointment of teachers. The staple religiousinstruction is in accordance with an agreed syllabus. Denominational instruction may be given onnot more than two periods a week to those children whose parents ask for it.An aided school is a voluntary school in which the managers appoint the teachers and areresponsible for half the cost of structural improvements and of external repairs. The staple religiousinstruction is denominational. . . &apos;.-40926
7. Proposed amendment of Section 104 of the Education Act, 1944. ThisSection now enables me to pay half the cost of a new aided school which is requiredfor displaced pupils or half of that part of the cost which is attributable to suchpupils: provided that(a) the number of displaced pupils is &quot; substantial &quot; in relation to the size ofthe new school, and(b) the pupils are displaced from some other aided school, or schools, either as a result of reorganisation or because the number of pupils educatedthere is substantially reduced.It is this last alternative condition which now bears hardly on the Roman Catholics,since, owing to the necessary limitations on school building and the general growth of the school population, it is rarely possible for existing schools to be substantially reduced in size even where there is a movement of population, e.g., from the centre of a town to a new housing estate.8. The Roman Catholics would, undoubtedly, like the definition of displacedpupils to be widened so as to include any pupils for whom education would, in&quot;to be available for them &quot;in ided in S(?me otuher aided or specialconsequence of their parents ^to reside in the area served by it.having ceased&quot;. ; originally dratted, but there are, as(a) it would cover any case of change of residence on the part of parents forwhatever cause;(b) it would mean that any individual child who had ever been in a roman catholic school could be counted for calculating grant. There wouldbe serious administrative difficulties in identifying individual pupils or small groups of them for purposes of grant under the Section.In any case, I am clear that an extension of the Act in this sense would. involvea big breach in the underlying principle of the &quot; settlement &quot; (see paragraph 5) andI think that any concession must be limited both as regards the circumstances ofthe parents&apos; change of residence and also as regards the minimum number of pupils required to qualify for grant on the new school.9. I propose, therefore, that a new category of displaced pupils should beadded to the two already provided by Section 104 of the Act. This category would consist of pupils who have attended or would, in the Minister&apos;s opinion, have attended an existing aided or special agreement school if that school had not ceased to be available for them in consequence of their having ceased to reside in the areaserved by that school as a result of action taken, or proposed to be taken, underthe enactments relating to housing or town and country planning. It would bea condition of grant that the number of displaced pupils should be substantial(i.e., at least one class, or 30 in the case of secondary schools and 40 in the caseof primary schools).10. I also have in mind an amendment of Section 104 (2) (b), which wouldenable me to pay grant in those not infrequent cases, where an existing building ispurchased as the premises, or as the nucleus of the premises, of a new school. Atpresent, displaced pupils&apos; grant is payable only in respect of expenditure on theconstruction of the school.11. Proposed amendment of Section 1 of the Education Act, 1946. I also propose to extend the scope of Section .1 of the 1946 Education Act* to enableLocal Education Authorities not only to enlarge existing controlled schools butalso to provide new controlled schools where the accommodation is wholly or mainly required for pupils for whom accommodation would have been provided in some other voluntary school if that other school had not been discontinuedor had not otherwise ceased to be available for the purpose.* Under the Education Act, 1944, the Local Education Authority were made responsible for the site and buildings of an existing voluntary controlled school, but had no power to carry out a sub-stantial enlargement of the school. The amendment in Section 1 of the Education Act, 1946, which enabled them under certain conditions to enlarge existing controlled schools, was designed to meetthe case where it is more economical or educationally efficient to enlarge a controlled school than tobuild a new county school or continue to maintain a number of small controlled schools.

The Roman Catholics would, undoubtedly, like the definition of displacedpupils to be widened so as to include any pupils for whom education would, inthe opinion of the Minister, have been provided in some other aided or special agreement school if that school had not ceased^to reside in the area served by it.This was the form in which the 1944 Act was originally drafted, but there are, asit seems to me, two objections to the suggestion, viz.:  (a) it would cover any case of change of residence on the part of parents forwhatever cause;(b) it would mean that any individual child who had ever been in a roman catholic school could be counted for calculating grant. There wouldbe serious administrative difficulties in identifying individual pupils or small groups of them for purposes of grant under the Section.In any case, I am clear that an extension of the Act in this sense would. involvea big breach in the underlying principle of the &quot; settlement &quot; (see paragraph 5) andI think that any concession must be limited both as regards the circumstances ofthe parents&apos; change of residence and also as regards the minimum number of pupils required to qualify for grant on the new school.9.

Ministry of Education, W. 1,18th July, 1951.12. A private member&apos;s amendment to this effect was withdrawn when the1946 Act was before the House, but it would be welcomed by the Church ofEngland who would benefit little, if at all, by the amendment of Section 104 and by a number of County Local Education Authorities. In rural areas thereare large numbers of small controlled Church of England schools which will ultimately have to be re-built because they fall so far short of modern require-ments. Under the present law these schools can be replaced by new controlledschools of the same size; but if it is proposed to replace two or more by a singleschool, which may be desirable both on educational and on economic grounds,the new school, under the present law, can only be a county school or an aidedschool. The latter alternative is not likely to be practicable from the Church&apos;spoint of view. Nor would it be palatable to the Free Churches. On the otherhand to build a new county school would mean depriving the Church of Englandof its rights in regard to religious instruction and the appointment of managers.These difficulties would be overcome if Local Education Authorities were enabled to provide a new controlled school in these circumstances.13. Concurrently with these extra benefits to voluntary schools I proposeto take general powers to secure the continuity of any voluntary school towardswhich substantial contributions from public funds are made. This is a normal con-dition of grant in other fields and it was no doubt an oversight that the point wasnot fully covered in previous legislation.14. Miscellaneous Amendments. I should like to take the opportunity of amending legislation to make a number of minor and uncontroversial changes inthe law which experience has shown to be desirable. These would include some ofthe changes recommended by the Local Government Man-power Committee. Noneis of sufficient importance to call for specific notice in the present memorandum.15. Cost to the Exchequer. It is difficult to estimate the financial implications of these proposals with any precision. The only item which would add appreciablyto the liability of the Exchequer is the amendment to Section 104. I should expect that an amendment to Section 104 of the kind I have indicated might result in an ultimate increase in Exchequer grant to Managers or Governors of aided schools ofnot more than  4 or  5 million. There would also be a potential commitment of upto the same amount by way of Exchequer loan under Section 105 of the Act, though in practice the amount borrowed would probably be considerably less than theamount paid in grant, since many bodies of Managers have accumulated someresources of their own, and others can borrow privately on favourable terms. Thesesums would, however, be totals covering a period of many years. The annual costto the Exchequer over the next few years would not, so far as I can foresee, be likelyto amount to more than  125,000- 150,000 by way of grant and loan combined.16. The other amendments, including the extension of Section 1 of the 1946Act, are unlikely to increase the charge on the Exchequer to any considerable extent.17. Consultation with the Churches and other Bodies. Before agreeing that parliamentary time should be made available for a measure of the kind I have described though I do not contemplate legislation in the present session mycolleagues would no doubt wish to be assured that it would not provoke seriouscontroversy. I cannot give them a firm answer on this until I have had talks withthe various interests concerned, including the Opposition. My purpose at present is merely to seek authority to undertake such consultation on a confidential basis.If the results are favourable I would then submit my proposals for legislation in further detail.G.
