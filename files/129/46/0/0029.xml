&quot;   154THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY  OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  Juner 1951SECRET Copy No. 31CP. (51) 17926th June, 1951CABINETINFORMATION policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations the purpose of this paper is to point out the need for a renewed and vigorousinformation campaign in this country. Once again, as in 1947, there is a dangerlest uncertainty and confusion in the public mind may prevent the carrying out of necessary national policies. The causes of public doubt and uncertainty are new and therefore the information campaign that is needed would have a new accent andemphasis. As always, however, if a concerted drive is to be made to instruct publicopinion, the lead given by Ministers will be of decisive importance.2. In 1947 the uncertainty sprang from the exposure of the country to new and unfamiliar economic circumstances. Very considerable success was achieved in informing the public mind about the rather complex problems of exports and imports, the balance of trade and the true nature of the danger of inflation. Ithink it will be agreed that without this heightened degree of public comprehensionof the real problems facing the nation we could not have attained so great anincrease in productivity nor so wide a restraint in wage and dividend claims.3. The problem of public information with which we are now again faced is somewhat similar though more complex. There is once again the danger that un-certainty and confusion in the public mind may frustrate necessary policies. once again the people are exposed to new and unfamiliar circumstances that they mustunderstand if pur problems are to be solved. The problem is this time more complex because questions of foreign policy no less than novel questions of economics are involved indeed they are inseparably intertwined.4. For the first time since before the war, there is danger of doubt and divisionabout the basis and implications of our foreign policy. As the Communists havegrasped, one of the best ways to undermine our economic policy at home is to attack and misrepresent our foreign policy. The Communists are concentrating uponstirring up anti-American feeling and painting the United States as an imperialist,aggressive power that is anti-British, dragging Britain at its heels and ruining us by its stock-piling. The Communists are helped by genuine waves of anti-Americansentiment and, of course, by some of the unwise things done by America and bythe many unwise things said by Americans. But this anti-American feeling, whichwe must expect to encounter from time to time, has, I think, deeper causes; it is oneof the ways in which public opinion expresses its doubts and confusions abouteconomic events at home the diversion of wealth to armaments, high prices, the deferment of the fruits of recovery and so forth. It is the sign that we cannot, inthe absence of a strong and positive lead to public opinion by the Government,expect the responses called for from all classes of the people under the heavy impact of rearmament. .5. Propaganda and information alone cannot of course solve these problems.The actual things we do in home and foreign affairs will matter most. But the fact remains that we cannot conduct a rearmament programme unless the people areactively and positively with us-and this they can only, be if they understand andaccept both the need for rearmament and its implications in their daily lives.   As40807
our earlier information campaign about the balance of trade showed, considerableresults can be achieved with the British people if only they understand the problemsbefore them. In a word we need to explain the reasons for our foreign policy inorder to succeed in solving our economic problems at home: and simultaneously we need to get our people to understand these economic problems and the way in whicht they arise, in order that they may sustain our foreign policy. Both for reasons of foreign and home policy we need public enlightenment about the same set of problems.6. What therefore we have to do is to bring home to our people with greater emphasis and persistence than has yet been done the true nature of the Soviet regime and the rear motives behind Soviet behaviour in international affairs. Only if wesuccessfully bring home to our people the root cause of our policies will they suffi-ciently accept the need for rearmament and all that it implies. Only then can wetackle the waves of anti-American feeling that hamper public acceptance of theconsequences of rearmament. Only then will our people understand the way inwhich many of their hardships are linked up with rearmament.7. There are thus a number of related problems about which we must seek to instruct the public mind. They are quite complex, but no more complex than theproblems about the balance of trade that we did succeed hi getting over. And atthe bottom of all these problems is the relatively simple one of a realisation of theSoviet Communist danger and the need for rearmament.8. There is a further difficulty in the field of information policy, and it is this.Although we have to expound a new and different set of premises and although the argument from these premises is new and different nevertheless the. conclusions in terms of the public behaviour we want to induce is the same as before. We- need to keep up exports and savings; we need restraint in personal incomes; we need more production. One of the chief difficulties is that the lessons we mustdraw from our new campaign may seem a stale and monotonous repetition of whatthe people have already heard too often. There is the danger that the public isgetting inoculated against this sort of admonition, and sick of a surfeit of preaching.9. This is a problem that will always be with us quite apart from rearmamentand which we will have continuously to face in different forms. If we are to main-tain full employment there will be a constant danger of inflationary pressure. If we want to press on with our policies for social improvement we will always need greater productivity. I think that there is no alternative but to tackle this problem franklyand tell the people that we will always need increased production. There is no other way of getting the things we want as a people. The only alternative is standing stillor going back. Increased productivity is not only the cure for particular problemsfacing the nation at any given moment; it is a permanent necessity. This approach would enable us to relate our arguments to social progress as well as to thepresent need for rearmament.10. I doubt whether a new large-scale Government publicity campaign forincreased productivity would be wise or opportune. This is a matter for our experts to consider and give us advice upon. In any case the people heed some variety of diet and we should consider new terms and new methods of approach.The main point, however, is that if we set resolutely and effectively aboutinstructing the public on the realities underlying foreign policy and the way inwhich this impinges upon the economy we will be simultaneously helping the campaign that we must always keep going for harder work and self-restraint., 11. I propose to raise these matters on the Home and Overseas ministerial committees where we can give them detailed consideration. I am also asking thecorresponding official committees to consider all the detailed arrangements thatmight be made.-12. However well we use the information machine and however forcefullyparticular Ministers deal with the aspects of the problem with which they aredepartmentally concerned, there can be no effective campaign without a concertedlead from Ministers as a whole. The essential thing is to get across the premisefrom which all else flows namely the Russian danger and the need for rearmament.Incidentally the problems with which we are faced will arise in a particularly difficult form in parts of the Labour Movement and there of course the information services cannot directly help. Only Ministers can find the right language and hope to carry conviction.
Commonwealth Relations Office, S.WA,*26th June, 1951Through their speeches, and by working in close conjunction with the ForeignOffice, Ministers can also.give direct help to our overseas information, by providing the material that the overseas information services require to sustain certain themesof propaganda. - , ,    y       &apos;13. I understand that the Minister of Labour has arranged,. in agreementwith the Trade Unions, that the Treasury will provide a regular survey of theeconomic situation for the National Joint Advisory Council, and it is hoped for an increasing number of responsible office-holders in the employers&apos; organisations andTrade Unions.- The Chancellor also informed me that he is considering the resumption for atime of the fairly regular press conferences held by his predecessor in 1947 and 1948.I am sure that would be of the greatest value. Only the Chancellor can give a leadon the crucial economies arising from rearmament.14. Everything, however, turns upon pursuading the public of the reality ofthe Soviet danger and the need for rearmament. All the economic persuasion andargument will flow from this. It will be as serious for our home as for our foreignpolicy if the need for rearmament and its implications and repercussions are notgrasped and accepted by the people.I hope therefore that more of us will seek opportunities for speaking to thecountry on these matters. The Prime Minister has recently authorised the appoint-ment of a group of officials to act as a focus for the preparation of material, for usein Ministerial speeches and in other ways on the economic impacts, objects and purposes, and progress of rearmament programmes; and I hope that full use willbe made of these official arrangements, which will soon operate and should provideus with well-considered material for the purpose of explaining these matters to thecountry.P. C. G.-W.
