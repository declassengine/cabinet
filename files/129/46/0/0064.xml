-liUS   DOCUMENT  IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S   GOV ERNMEN 1    307Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1951SECRETCP. (51) 21427//? July, 1951CABINETEGYPT: DEFENCE QUESTIONS AND THE sudan memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will recall that, after the Egyptians rejected His Majesty&apos;governments proposals for a new Defence Agreement delivered to the egyptian government on 11th April, it was agreed (CM. (51) 39th Conclusions, Minute 4) thatHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador should invite the Egyptian Government to discuss thefuture of the Sudan on the basis of four principles which it was suggested might provide common ground for agreement between the two Governments. The objectof this approach was primarily to keep the negotiations open without making anyfurther concessions on defence questions, on which our proposals represented thelimit to which we were prepared to go.2. On 8th June His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador delivered to the Egyptian Ministerfor Foreign Affairs an Aide-Memoire containing the four principles relating to theSudan, together with a second brief Aide-Memoire about the defence question. the texts of these memoranda and of the Egyptian reply, which was delivered on 6th July, are reproduced in the appendices of this paper. In their reply, the Egyptiansreject His Majesty&apos;s Governments proposals on the Sudan in terms almost asuncompromising as those which they employed in connection with the defence pro-posals of 11th April, and, as in the case of the latter proposals, they reassert their traditional position. This is, broadly, that the Sudan and Egypt are one countryand that His Majesty&apos;s Government have no justification of any kind for its claims to protect the interests of the Sudanese. They go on to propose that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should first withdraw all British officials and military forces from theSudan within two years, and that the country should then be united with Egyptunder the Egyptian Crown. Within the framework of this unity the Sudanese people should have self-government. As regards the defence proposals, the Egyptians reply that His Majesty&apos;s Government has nothing to lose from procrastination, but that egypt cannot contemplate an indefinite prolongation of the present talks withoutany prospect of agreement.3. This reaction was expected. My colleagues will recall that I suggested thatwe should have to consider, when the subject of the Sudan had been exhausted,whether to propose to the Egyptian Government some different basis of approach to the defence problem. When I made this suggestion I had in mind the possibilityof admitting Egypt as a partner in a new Allied Middle East Command, in returnfor which she would be expected to make available to the Allied Command at anyrate those minimum facilities which she still refuses to grant to us. The chancesthat the Egyptians will accept such an offer are perhaps not very great. TheEgyptian Foreign Minister, in a recent press statement, has reiterated that egypt would never collaborate with us in any military effort until we had evacuated the canal Zone and permitted the Sudan to unite with Egypt. Nevertheless the suggested partnership in a Middle East Allied Command seems at present to offer the only likely basis upon which the negotiations can be prolonged. I am not yetable to submit a firm proposal on this point to my colleagues, as the details are still under study.Copy No.3 140966b
4. Meanwhile, as regards the Sudan, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador has had several discussions with the Egyptian Foreign Minister about the Egyptian reply,and has taken the line that it must be possible to find some common denominatorof agreement between the two Governments, however low that may be. TheEgyptian Foreign Minister agreed to refer to his Prime Minister a- proposal thata new set of principles on which both sides could agree should be worked out andincorporated in an exchange of notes setting forth the point of view of each government.5. For the moment, therefore, the discussions are continuing. But the possi-bility cannot be entirely discounted that the Egyptian Government may break offnegotiations altogether. The Egyptian Foreign Minister told His Majesty&apos;ambassador, when handing him the Egyptian reply (Appendix III), that if no satisfactory basis for negotiations could be found before the end of the presentEgyptian parliamentary session, the Egyptian Government would have to makea public statement justifying their inability to continue the negotiations. On theother hand, we believe that both King Farouk and the Egyptian Prime Ministerare anxious to avoid a break. But even if there is no break before the end of thepresent Egyptian parliamentary session, there is considerable likelihood of a breakat the beginning of the following session next November, at the time of the Speechfrom the Throne, unless we have been able to put forward our new proposals tothe Egyptian Government before then.6. For the present, therefore, I merely invite my colleagues to take note ofthe Egyptian reply and of the actual situation. As regards the immediate future,I recommend that if, but only if, there are clear signs that a break is likely beforethe end of the present Egyptian parliamentary session, His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Alexandria should be authorised to inform the Egyptian Foreign Minister thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government have under consideration a definite new approach tothe solution of the defence question. Meanwhile His MajestVs Governmentsincerely hope that the Egyptian Government.will not take any steps which rendera break in the negotiations inevitable. At the same time His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadorwould be instructed to see that the sense of his remarks to the Egyptian ForeignMinister was conveyed to King Farouk, in the hope that the latter would use his influence to prevent the Egyptian Government from breaking off the negotiations.H. M.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,21th July, 1951.
Aide-Memoire on the SudanDespite the fact that no material progress has been made in the direction of a defence Agreement, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, while maintaining their view that the question of the Sudan is entirely separate from thatof Defence, are prepared to open discussions on the Sudan with the egyptian government.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom hope, as a first step, tosecure the agreement of the Egyptian Government to the principles set forth inthe annex to this Aide-Memoire. These principles represent an earnest attempt byHis Majesty&apos;s Government to formulate a common statement of objectives inregard to the future of the Sudan. It will be observed that they recognise the inter-dependence of Egypt and the Sudan, they enable the Egyptian Government toplay their proper part in the evolution of the Sudan and at the same time they take into account His Majesty&apos;s Governments own commitments to the Sudanesepeople.If the Egyptian Government are willing to subscribe to these principles it might then be possible to work out jointly a programme of political and economic develop-ment in the Sudan.These principles have been drafted with the greatest care and with the objectof avoiding affront to both the Egyptian and the Sudanese people and also of avoiding any misconstruction of their true meaning of the kind which contributed to the failure of the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations in 1946.British Embassy, Cairo,8th June, 1951.AnnexStatement of Principles(a) In view of the dependence of both Egypt and the Sudan on the waters ofthe Nile and in order to ensure the fullest co-operation in expanding the supplies available and in sharing them, it is essential that the friendliest relations should linkthe two peoples.(b) It is the common aim of Egypt and Great Britain to enable the people ofthe Sudan to attain full self-government as soon as practicable and thereafter choosefreely for themselves their form of government and the relationship with Egypt thatwill best meet their needs as they then exist.(c) In view of the wide differences of culture, race, religion and political development existing among the Sudanese, the process of attaining full self-government requires the co-operation of Egypt and the United Kingdom with the sudanese.(d) The two Governments therefore agree to set up forthwith a tripartite corn-mission in order to help the Sudanese towards the goal in (b) and to assist them in formulating their future Constitution.Sth June, 1951.APPENDIX IIAide-Memoire on DefenceHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are making a careful study of the proposals contained in the Egyptian Governments Aide-Memoire of24th April in regard to a possible new Anglo-Egyptian Defence Agreement in thehope that some way may be found of narrowing the wide divergency of view whichevidently exists between the British and Egyptian proposals or at least that somecommon approach to the problem can be worked out. Meanwhile, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom note with disappointment that whereas their40966 b 2
own proposals represented a very considerable modification of the position laiddown by the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, the Egyptian proposals do not appearto differ in essence from the claims put forward by the Egyptian Government as their objectives when they assumed power some 18 months ago.British Embassy, Cairo,8th June, 1951.APPENDIX IIIEgyptian Reply1. The Royal Egyptian Government hope that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom have completed the study of the Egyptian counter-proposalsconcerning evacuation which were contained in the Aide-Memoire handed by theEgyptian Foreign Minister to the British Ambassador on 24th April last. sufficient time had no doubt elapsed since then to enable His Majesty^ Government tocomplete that study and to give an opinion on the said counter-proposals.2. The Royal Egyptian Government find themselves obliged to call HisMajesty&apos;s Governments attention to the impossibility of going on indefinitely withthe talks conducted between the two Parties since July 1950. Hitherto these talkshave lasted over a year without a glimpse of hope towards reaching the desiredagreement. Indeed, these talks are no more than a further link in the chain ofattempts made in vain by Egypt since the end of World War II to impress uponGreat Britain the necessity of respecting Egypt&apos;s rights and of putting a stop to the aggression against her sovereignty and the integrity of her territory. It is obviousthat His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom lose nothing by this pro-crastination, but it has become extremely difficult for the Royal Egyptian Govern-ment and Egyptian public opinion to contemplate any further prolongation of this state of affairs.The remark made in the British Embassy&quot;s Aide-Memoire dated 8th June. 1951,that the Egyptian counter-proposals do not appear to differ in essence from theclaims put forward by the Egyptian Government as their objectives when theyassumed power some 18 months ago is unwarrantable and there can be no com-parison between the positions of the two Governments in the manner set forth inthe said Aide-Memoire, for whereas the Royal Egyptian Government claiminviolable national rights which cannot be bartered away, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom pursue exaggerated interests, and when right and interest are at variance, right should be made to prevail.Nevertheless, the Royal Egyptian Government have done their uttermost to reconcile the interests claimed by Great Britain to Egypt&apos;s rights. They believe inall sincerity that their counter-proposals can alone satisfactorily ensure thisreconciliation.3. The Royal Egyptian Government cannot differentiate between certainnational rights and others. They cannot countenance separating the question of evacuation from that of the unity of Egypt and the Sudan under the Egyptiancrown. Indeed, they regard these two questions as one indivisible whole, and it is inevitable that both questions be simultaneously settled and covered by any agree-ment to be concluded between the two Parties.4. The Royal Egyptian Government are glad to see that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom have abandoned their view of postponing the discussion of the question of the Sudan. They have no objection to the formulation of a common statement of objectives in regard to the future of theSudan, but they cannot possibly accept the view-point contained in the BritishAide-Memoire and its Annex in regard to those objectives for the following reasons:  First: The British viewpoint omitted to mention the Unity of Egypt and TheSudan under the Egyptian Crown. This is an established fact and no agreement which fails to recognise this fact can ever be acceptable to anyEgyptian Government. True, the British Aide-Memoire stated that theprinciples annexed thereto recognise the interdependence of Egypt and
The Sudan but the Annex limited this interdependence to the waters of theNile and drew only one conclusion therefrom: that it is essential that thefriendliest relations should link the two peoples.In fact the link of the dependence of both Egypt and The Sudan onthe waters of the Nile the importance of which no one would under-- estimate is not the only link that binds together Egypt and The Sudanfrom time immemorial. There is the community of race, language,religion, culture, customs and interests as well as the geographical unity,the economic unity, &amp;c. In the presence of all these strong and inseverableties it is gross injustice for the British Aide-Memoire and its Annex to speak of two countries and two peoples instead of speaking of one countryand one people indivisible, inseparable.Second: The British Aide-Memoire spoke of commitments of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to the Sudanese people. It is not enough for His Majesty?sGovernment in the United Kingdom to impose upon themselves those so-called obligations deriving from no right whatever then make use of themto-day for separating Egyptians and their compatriots the Sudanese.Indeed the historical and legal position of the Unity of Egypt and TheSudan leaves no gap for His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom to penetrate through on the pretext of their obligations towards the sudanese. The Royal Egyptian Government have on many occasionsmade clear this position and a recapitulation thereof would be superfluoushere.Third: The Annex referred to the wide differences of culture, race, religionand political development existing among the Sudanese. Some of these differences lack actual scientific support such as the difference of race.The Sudan Administration is to blame for the rest of those differences for it has deliberately sought to isolate the South of The Sudan from theNorth and to prevent the inhabitants of the North from getting in touchwith those of the South thereby standing in the way of natural penetrationand spreading of the Arabic language and the Moslem religion into theSouth.In any case, the Royal Egyptian Government can by no means acceptthose differences as an argument to distinguish between the various partsof The Sudan or to hinder the Sudanese in their entirety from enjoyingself-government.5. In view of the above, the Royal Egyptian Government propose that thestatement of principles should be made as follows:  (a) The Unity of Egypt and The Sudan under the Egyptian Crown.(b) Self-Government for the Sudanese within the framework of this unity intwo years.(c) British forces and British officials to be withdrawn from The Sudan and thepresent regime in The Sudan to be terminated immediately upon the expiry of those two years.(d) In the event of the principles outlined in (d), (b) and (c) being accepted,the Royal Egyptian Government agree to setting up a tripartite corn-mission in order to help attain the goal in (b).6th July, 1951.
