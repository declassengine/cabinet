&apos;    199   /THIS-document-IS T-HE- PROPER T-Y-OF HIS BRITANNIC -majesty is-GOVERNMEN^)confidential cp. (51) 188 COPY NO.   1 j3RD JULY,-1951CABINETRESUMPTION OF VISITS BY HIS MAJESTY&apos;S ships to SPANISH PORTSMemorandum by the First Lord of the admiralty for upwards of ten years past, there has been a ban on H. M. Shipsmaking the courtesy visits to Spanish Ports which were a regular feature oftheir periodical cruises in earlier times.   In 1946, the General Assembly ofthe United Nations adopted several recommendations concerning Spain, oneof which was to the effect that Member States should withdraw their Ambassadorsand Ministers from Madrid.   The 1946 resolution was, however, revoked by aresolution passed in November, 1950, and our Ambassador in Madrid hasnow taken up his post.   In these circumstances, His Majesty&apos;s government&apos;s policy as previously maintained towards Spain may now be considered somewhatmodified, and I suggest for the consideration of the Cabinet that the time has now come when the ban that has applied to almost all visits of H. M. Ships to Spanishports and vice versa should be lifted.2. In recent years, the only visit by H. M. Ships to Spain has beenthat of one flotilla of motor fishing vessels of the Royal Navy which visitedVigo and Bilbao in July, 1948.   This visit, which was necessary for refuelling,etc., was a complete success and attracted no adverse criticism from any quarter.   Equally, only one Spanish warship has paid a visit to a British port -the DATO to Lagos in 1947.   Before the revocation of the 1946 resolution of theGeneral Assembly, an American Naval squadron consisting of the cruiserCOLUMBUS, wearing the flag of Admiral Connolly, an anti-aircraft cruiser .and two destroyers entered Ferrol in September, 1949, on a visit described by the Americans as &quot;unofficial&quot;.   Subsequently, in May, 1950, an american naval squadron visited Palma de Mallorca and in December, 1950, very shortly after the revocation of the 1946 resolution, a Dutch Naval squadron consistingof an aircraft carrier, a destroyer and two submarines visited Valencia.   InJanuary, 1951, the American cruiser NEWPORT NEWS accompanied by four destroyers visited Barcelona.I have been unable to trace any other visits by ships of north atlantic Treaty countries during the last two years.3. The value to the Fleet of the facilities which used to be available for the Spanish civil war in Spanish anchorages is considerable.   Spainpossesses magnificent harbours which can accommodate large fleets and thereare exceptionally good facilities for harbour training and seamanship instruction.In pre-war days these harbours were used regularly.  At present, their loss isrestricting the scope of Home Fleet movements outside our own watersas it is not not desirable, even if it were possible, to use the same foreign portsyear after year.     The Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, would very much liketo resume visits to Spain and I would propose for the Cabinet1 s consideration thatthey should be resumed this year.&quot;
4. This question came before the Defence Committee at its meetingon the 28th May, 1951 (D. O. (51) 13th Meeting, Minute 3) when in view of thepolitical implications, it was referred to the Cabinet.   My predecessor was invited, in submitting his memorandum, to include a statement of historicalprecedents for visits of H. M. Ships to countries whose governments weremanifestly unacceptable to public opinion in the United Kingdom.5. The precedents have now been examined in respect of visits to greece, following the political executions in 1922, to Japan, following the invasion of Manchukuo in 1931, to Italy, Germany and the Argentine.Greece -  The British Minister to Greece was withdrawn from athens at the end of 1922 after the Greeks had executed a number of generalsand politicians who were considered responsible for their defeat by Turkey andwe were on bad terms with Greece until about April, 1923.   Records of shipvisits about this period are not complete, but while no visits to Greek ports on the mainland appear to have taken place, numerous ships visited Mudrosand Mitylene.   They were, however, probably engaged in connection with thewithdrawal of allied forces following the Armistice signed at Mudania inOctober, 1922.Japan - Following the invasion of Manchukuo in September, 1931,His Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs relations with Japan were strained althoughAmbassadors were not withdrawn.   Prior to the autumn of 1931, visits were paid at intervals of a few months by ships of the China Station to Yokohama,Nagasaki, Kobe, and other ports.   It is significant, however, that no visits toany of these ports were paid between October, 1931, and September, 1932,when Japan left the League of Nations.Italy - Italy*s invasion of Abyssinia began in October, 1935,and that country was annexed in May, 1936.   The Italian conquest was notrecognised de jure until the Anglo-Italian Agreement of April, 1938.We were not, therefore, on good terms with Italy from the autumn of 1935until the spring of 1938 and this period was, of course, clouded by the inter-vention of Italy in the Spanish Civil War.    Nevertheless, Ambassadors werenot withdrawn.   I find that while there were no visits to Italian ports duringthe period of active operations in Abyssinia, H. M. Ships visited Naples inDecember, 1936, and October, 1937, Brindisi in August, 1936, and Syracuse inJanuary, April and June, 1937.Germany -  The number of visits paid to German ports during theyears 1934 - 1939 was less than would probably have been the case had therebeen a less unfriendly regime in Germany.   Nevertheless, visits by a squadron of five ships to Swinemunde took place in 1934, H. M. Ships ACHILLES andLEANDER visited Kiel and Stettin respectively in July, 1934, and h.M, Ship CHERWELL visited Hamburg in 1934 and 1935.   Visits byH. M. Ships to Wilhelmshaven, Cuxhaven and Kiel took place in 1936,followed by visits to Hamburg and Flensburg in 1937.   The only visitsubsequent to 1937 was by the Admiralty Yacht ENCHANTRESS to Kiel in1938, and no visits appear to have taken place in 1939.Argentina -   President Peron assumed office in June, 1946, andvisits by the Flagship of the America and West Indies Squadron were made toArgentina in March, 1947, and again in January/February, 1949.   These visitswere followed by H.M. Ship SPARROWs visit in February, 1950, and the most recent visit took place as lately as February of this year and was by H.M. ShipSUPERB, wearing the flag of the Commander-in-Chief, America and west indies Station.
6, I would suggest that although the precedents quoted above are notconclusive, as we now have full diplomatic representation in Spain, courtesyvisits of ships might now be regarded as normal.   I understand that theForeign Secretary agrees in principle with the resumption of visits, butsuggests that at the outset our relations should be restricted to one or two small visits.  As I point out in paragraph 3, however, the value to the Navyof visits to Spanish ports lies in the exceptionally good facilities foraccommodating large fleets, and I would venture to hope that the Cabinet,while accepting a small visit at the outset, would be prepared to accept anincrease in the numbers and importance of the ships before the end of the year.P.Admiralty, S. W. 1.,3RD JULY, 1951.
