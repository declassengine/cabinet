(51) .197IQth Ju(y, ,1951 ,)HJ/, t^gyjCABINETERECTION OF A MEMORIAL AT DUNKIRKMemorandum by the Minister of defence the Standing Committee of Service Ministers recently discussed, at the instanceof the Secretary of State for War, who is Chairman of the Imperial War graves commission ((I.W.G.C), a proposal by the Commission to erect a memorial atDunkirk to soldiers who fell in the campaigns ending with the evacuation from that port and who have no known grave. ,2. The Commission have been unable to find any outstanding site for the memorial on the beaches or overlooking them and the only suitable alternativeappears to be a plot of land containing a considerable number of graves of boththe 1914-18 and the 1939-45 War in the large Dunkirk Civil Cemetery. This siteis so situated that the memorial would abut on the main road. The City of Dunkirkauthorities would facilitate the acquisition of the land.3. The funds which the Commission would have available for a memorial ofthis kind are based on a cost of  5 a name. The probable number of names to becommemorated would be about 4,600. Some  23,000 would therefore be availablefor the construction of a memorial and. the engraving of the names.4. Before they proceed with commissioning a design within these money limits and suitable to the available site, the Commission have asked whether the Govern-ment has it in mind to commemorate the exploits of the forces at Dunkirk withany form of national battlefield memorial; or would wish to regard the memorialto be erected by the Commission as both a memorial to the missing in the earlycampaigns of the 1939-45 War and also as some form of national battlefieldmemorial. In the latter case, they suggest that the Government would wish to makea suitable contribution to enable a memorial to be erected which would becommensurate with the importance of the Dunkirk operation and the place it holdsin the public mind.5. After the 1914-18 War the question of erecting national memorials on themain battlefields was considered by the National Battlefields Memorial Committee.As a result of its recommendations there were eventually erected a number ofmemorials such as the Menin Gate at Ypres, the Somme Memorial at Thiepval, the gallipoli Memorial, &amp;c. The number of missing to be commemorated was so great in the 1914-18 War that, in general, enough money was available on the  5capitation basis mentioned above without additional Government contributions.The Australian and Canadian Governments, however, contributed considerablesums to their main memorials at Villers Bretonneux and Vimy Ridge.6. Dunkirk holds a special place in British memories of the 1939-45 War.It is possible that a scheme on the lines of paragraph 3 might strike public opinionat home and abroad as unworthy of the &quot; great deliverance &quot; of Duificirk. I think,too, that if the Dunkirk memorial is to have this wider commemorative aspect, aswell as being a memorial to the British Army missing of the period betweenSeptember 1939 and May .1940, it certainly should be a three-Service memorial,in view of the large part played by the Navy and the Royal Air Force in theevacuation./40890
7. My colleagues will recall that three or four years ago the Cabinet consideredvarious ideas for a comprehensive National Memorial. Among the projectsdiscussed were developing the blitzed areas around St. Paul&apos;s, tidying up parliament square (now achieved in connection with the Festival of Britain) and a largenational scholarship scheme. Eventually, the Cabinet decided against the proposal,on a paper circulated by the Prime Minister in December 1947, mainly on the.grounds that there was no evidence of any effective public demand for a national war Memorial.8. A number of memorials of individual units and formations have beenerected under private arrangements to commemorate their exploits in the recentWar. A Standing Committee the Battle Exploits Memorials Committee was setup in 1946, on the analogy of the similar committee set up for this purpose afterthe 1914-18 War, to act as a clearing house for applications to erect suchmemorials and to adjudicate on claims. This Committee works in connection withthe I.W.G.C., who are represented upon it. The Commission assists with the neces-sary formalities with the foreign governments concerned and assists the promoters of approved projects in various other ways.9. The Service Ministers&apos; Committee were on the whole inclined to doubt theneed for a more ambitious scheme than that already planned by the Imperial War&apos;Graves Commission. The attitude of the public towards war memorials is rather different now from what it was after the 1914-18 War. The possibility of a thirdGreat War in the near future no doubt contributes to this difference. Further, theoperations at Dunkirk can hardly be regarded as worthy of celebration as a victory,despite their historical and military importance and the deep impression they madeon the public mind.10. In view, however, of the possible reactions of public opinion to ourproceeding with the modest plans of the Imperial War Graves Commission as described in paragraph 3,1 ask the Cabinet to decide whether (a) the Commission should be advised that the Government agree with theirpresent plans for a memorial at Dunkirk to the British Army missingof the .1939-40 campaign up till the date of the evacuation; or alter-natively, whether(b) the Government should mark the special place which the Dunkirk opera-tions hold in public opinion by making a financial contribution, andpossibly contributing further assistance, with a view to erecting a morenoteworthy memorial at Dunkirk; and, if at all possible, on a site over-looking the beaches.11. If the Cabinet prefer the larger scheme, they may wish His Royal highness the Duke of Gloucester, as President of the Imperial War Graves Commission, tobe consulted.E.
