BAMANGWATO AFFAIRS: TSHEKEDI KHAMA

Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations

The Conservatives and Liberals have tabled a Motion for Tuesday&apos;s debate in these terms:-

"Banishment of Tshekedi Khama, - That this House deplores the decision to continue the banishment of Tshekedi Khama from the Bamangwato Territory without hearing or inquiring into the grounds for such banishment; and calls upon His Majesty&apos;s Government to rescind the order of banishment and allow him to dwell freely within the territory of his tribe."

2. We must face the possibility that the Government may be defeated if it resists this Motion. I would like to consult my colleagues on whether we should stand and fight or give way.

3. In my view the policy we have adopted over Tshekedi Khama is the right one. Quite apart from the advice of my officials on the spot, we have considerable evidence of the explicit view of the Tribe that if Tshekedi Khama were now allowed to go back unconditionally to the Bamangwato Reserve there would be considerable danger of disorder and almost certainly non-co-operation by the Tribe with the Administration. The Tribe has already shown itself to be adept in non-co-operation. When I offered Tshekedi Khama limited and conditional access to his cattle posts I went as far as I felt safe without provoking too much hostility from the Tribe.

4. I don&apos;t think we can find any compromise between standing firm and abandoning our whole policy of excluding both Tshekedi Khama and Seretse Khama. Even if we gave way to the extent of having an enquiry into our whole policy this would call into question the Government&apos;s policy and would make it look as if Tshekedi Khama was more powerful than the Government. The effect on the Tribe would be deplorable. In any case the Motion is for Tshekedi Khama&apos;s unconditional return and this is the issue we have to face. If Tshekedi Khama goes back it would be quite impossible to continue to exclude Seretse Khama. It would be most unjust to do so and we would be faced with very grave problems of maintaining order in the Tribe which wants Seretse Khama but does not want Tshekedi Khama. Pressures would develop in Seretse Khama&apos;s favour at least as strong as those at present in Tshekedi Khama&apos;s favour. The White Paper policy under which both are excluded rests on connected arguments and it cannot be partially or selectively applied. Therefore if Tshekedi Khama goes back, Seretse Khama goes back too.
ing   V   r I am not sure what.will happen in the Tribe if both go backtogether: after a yearns exile they may manage to get on together atleast for a time j   Much more serious would be the possible reactions inSouth Africa.   It is,, of course, impossible to be certain about hypotheticalsituations and the Union is at the moment in a very curious and unpredict-able mood. ^ ,,,A year: agio, when we made our decision about Seretse, I have little doubt Switlffie reaction to the installation of Seretse Khama as Chief would    \have been t&quot; inflame and unite all white opinion in South Africa against us.No man can be installed.as Chief of a Tribe without a positive act of con-firmation on our part.    This would have been regarded in the Union asgiving the official seal and blessing of His Majesty*s Government to theprinciple of mixed marriage, and this, as they would see it, in the midst oftheir national territory.    We would have had to face an angry wave ofemotion that would have been as strong amongst nearly all the 3ritish asamongst Afrikaners and would have united both political parties.   (The lateField jvdarshal Smuts was strongly against the recognition of Seretse^)Our relations would have been strained to breaking point and we wouldprobably have had to face a demand for tlie transfer of the Territoriesthat wov*Sd hifre been very hard to withstand.    .6. We must assume that if Seretse Khama now goes back to the Tribeit will wish to make him Chief.    We could not, if we gave way on our mainpolicy, withhold our assent and would thus (as South Africa sees it) put ourseal of approval upon mixed marriage.    This would still produce a very grave reaction upon opinion in the Union.    But today the political parties are bitterly divided, as they were not a year ago, over the question of theentrenched clauses.    The United Party is all out to attack Malan.    It maybe, therefore, that white opinion would not be.inflamed and united as.itwould have been a year ago.    But I think we must reckon upon a veryfierce reaction from-Malan&apos;s.Government and although the Opposition mightnot now positively join with him, they would be extremely unliiely on this issue to oppose him. .7.        Malan can do a number of very awkward things.    In particular, he might (at the very moment of Commonwealth Defence talks) refuse to co-operate with us and more strongly press South Africa&apos;s claims for Simons-town.   He might also make things very difficult for us in the three high commission Territories.    Each of these is a. small territory that cannotstand on its own and is dependent on day-to-day co-operation with SouthAfrica in such matters as customs revenue, railways, veterinary arrange-    ^ments, the movement of trade, cattle and African labour.    This is particu-larly true of Basutoland, which is wholly surrounded by South Africanterritory.   We might nonetheless be able to hold the Territories as theUnion might flinch from an ultimate breach with us.    But we might wellfind that we could no longer administer the Territories properly.    unless we were ready to put a very great deal of money into them to keep the^agoing, they might fall into economic and social stagnation.    Thereby south africans case for transfer would be greatly strengthened.    Some Nationalistswould probably also use the episode to assist their campaign for a republic and severance.of their connection with the Commonwealth.i\ .   011 the merits of the case I therefore think we should stand and lntne House.    I cannot calculate the chances of success.    Cur case^ never been put whilst Tshckedi ,Xhama has been most able and active^ P putting his,    I think we have a very good case and answers to most ofe points with which Tshekedi Khamates influenced opinion; indeed I think
the case we can put-is really more convincing and more easily arguablethan a year ago over Seretse.    I think the bulk of the Party would comewith us if we are resolute tut there would, 1 suppose, be an irreconcilablecore that could not be moved by any arguments.    On the other hand, it isjSssible that some Conservatives would abstain or stay away.9,        We must consider what      could, do if we-should stand and pone-theless.be:defeated./ I Suppose&quot; that we would then announce that we would accept the views of the House,&apos;Teverse our whole policy and let bothSeretse Khama an&amp; Tshekedi iOiama go back.    This would gravely weaken4he Administration in all three Territories; imperil.our relations withSoath Africa; and porhaps have serious exacts upon Cornrnomvealthrelations.   We would have to do our best to cope with these consequences.10. .    The alternative is to give way and announce a reversal of our policy either before the debate or during its course.    This would havethe unhappy results set out in paragraph 9, but in addition it would be a heavy blow to our prestige/heavier perhaps than being defeated in theHouse.   We would also have endangered the chance of winning through and adhering to our policy.    All this must, however, be weighed againstthe consequence of a possible defeat in the House.11.       My colleagues may prefer to await the outcome of the PartyMeeting that will consider this matter on the morning of the debate.    Butif we are to do this, we must, I suggest, show great firmness between now and then and at the Party Meeting.P.C.G.-W.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1,22ND JUNE, 1951.
