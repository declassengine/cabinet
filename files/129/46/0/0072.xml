ANNEX I362Present situation in Libya as it affects the conclusion of a treatyIntroduction1.     By a Resolution of the 21st November 1949 theUnited Nations decided that the three territories of cyrenaica, Tripolitania and. Fezzan (the first twoadministered by the United Kingdom and the third byPrance) should be united in an independent state of libya not later than the 1st January 1952;    and a united nations Commissioner was appointed to assist the Libyans,in co-operation with the Administering Powers.    He wassaddled with an Advisory Council of ten members (one from each of the three territories, one representative of the minorities in Tripolitania, and one representative eachof the British, French, Uniced States, Egyptian andItalian Governments) whom he was to &quot;consult&quot; and bywhose advice he should &quot;be guided&quot;.    On the 17th November 1950the United Nations passed another resolution, which ineffect reaffirmed the first and recommended theU.N. Commissioner to press on with a programme for thetransfer of power to the Libyans.2e      It may be recalled that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentsinterest in Libya arose out of our liberation of thecountry and out of our war-time promise to the presentAmir of Cyrenaica (leader of the Senussi) that his people should not fall again under Italian domination;our aim since the war has been to secure in this friendlyterritory the essential military facilities andairfield rights which would be of great strategic importance to us in time of war.3o      Immediately after the passage of the U.N. Resolution,the Defence Committee (at their 25th Meeting on the20th December 19h9) therefore approved my predecessor&apos;recommendation that a treaty of alliance should be concluded with Cyrenaica,  in which territory our maininterest had hitherto lain.h.      It became evident however that we could not evenproclaim the independence of Cyrenaica, as an essential preliminary to the conclusion of a treaty, withoutappearing to prevent the unification of Libya and tosabotage the U.N. Resolution;    and my predecessor,  after considering the strong representations to this effectmade by the U.N. Commissioner in the spring of 1950,agreed to postpone the conclusion of a treaty.Military Factors5.      He was influenced in this decision not only by political considerations but also by the increasinginterest of the Service Departments in Libya as a wholerather than in Cyrenaica alone.    There are in fact betterfacilities for stationing troops in Tripolitania thanin Cyrenaica, although the political atmosphere in theformer is more uncertain;    and there is also theconsideration that the United States Government intend to retain extensive airfield facilities in Tripolitania.Without prejudging the recommendations of the Chiefs ofStaff, whose views have been sought, I think it is fair to say that on strategic grounds a treaty with Libyawill be required, permitting troops to be stationed in both Cyrenaica and Tripolitania.    On political groundsalso any treaty will have to be concluded with Libyaas a whole and not with one of its component parts.
Financial and Economic Factors6.     As regards the financial assistance which we shallhave to give in return for military facilities,  theChancellor of the Exchequer has similarly recognised the new situation &quot;by agreeing in principle that our support should he given to Libya instead of merely toCyrenaiea.    It is now expected that, in spite of opposition by the U.N.  Commissioner who favours U.N.control over any external subventions to Libya, we shallbe able to secure a Libyan currency based on sterling;the entry of Libya into the sterling area;    and (subjectto certain safeguards including the provision offinancial advisers) a United Kingdom monopoly of support for the Libyan budget.    In effect, we shall be the residual guarantors of the Libyan budget, at a cost ofprobably something rather over  1 million in a normalyear.    This should ensure as far as possible theeconomic (and hence ultimately the political)  stability of the new state which is essential for the maintenanceof our troops in Libya.Political Factors7.      There are however certain political difficulties about working to an all-Libyan plan.    Although ourclosest link is with Cyronaica, because of our war-timealliance with the Senussi and the Amir&apos;s strong desire for a British treaty, yet Tripolitania has over8/12ths of the population of Libya. (Cyrenaica havingabout 3/12ths and the Fezzan less than 1/12th)8Tripolitania is also the most developed of the three territories and inso facto the most receptive tounsettling foreign influences.    Our aim has therefore been to promote a federation of Libya in which thethree territories would have a certain autonomy, insteadof a centralised administration in which everythingwould be subordinated to Tripolitanian interests.    Thisnaturally corresponds to the wishes of the Cyrenaicans,and indeed of probably the majority of Tripolitanians.80      This policy has been consistently supported bythe United States Government whose interests in strategicfacilities is parallel to ours;    we have enjoyed alsothe support of the French Government in spite ofoccasional differences of opinion, because they wish toretain a political influence in the desert territory of the Fezzan similar to the British influence in cyrenaica;    and the Italians have also stood by us on important occasions in return for our assistance in themaintenance of their economic interests.    consequently the Libyan National (Constituent) Assembly,  on which each of the three territories has equal representation,has resolved that Libya shall be a federation of whichthe Amir of Cyrenaica shall be the king;    and it hassot up a provisional government of politicians whofavour an lliance with the United Kingdom.    Theprovisional Prime Minister is Mahmud Bey Muntasser,who is also Prime Minister of Tripolitania.9.     On the other hand, although we have been able tocarry the U.N. Commissioner with us so far, he hasbeen made perhaps excessively cautious by sustainedand virulent criticism by the Egyptians gene rallysupported by the Pakistani representative.    Both theEgyptian delegate on the U.N. Council for Libya andthe Egyptian Delegation to the 1950 U.N. Assembly in new York have accused the United Kingdom of working-2-
agaitie-fc -bi-io 19U9 Resolution by trying to create aseparate vassal state of Cyrenaiea;    and these attacks have been echoed in Libya by Beshir Bey Saadawi, aveteran Tripolitanian demagogue who enjoys financial support from the Egyptian Government,,United Nations10.    In view of this criticism,  and of the fact thatit is impossible for a constitutionally elected LibyanGovernment, competent to sign a treaty, to beestablished before the General Assembly of the U.N.meets next November, I have had to give speciallycareful consideration to the procedure which we shouldfollowc    There appear to be two dangers.    The one,which we must in any case face, will be an Egyptianeffort to prove to the Assembly that Libya is not a trulyindependent state but is under the domination of theUnited Kingdom and, to a less extent, of the U.S.A.The Egyptians and their friends may urge that a continuance of U0N9  supervision over the country isnecessary.    The second danger is that if we negotiatedall our desiderata with the Libyans,  including all the privileges and immunities which arc necessary for the stationing of troops in the country, before thedeclaration of Libyan independence, the General Assemblymight claim the right to examine our treaty and agreements in detail.11.    It would be obviously undesirable for a body likethe General Assembly of the U.N. to be given theopportunity of discussing an agreement which we haveto make with another state.Proposals12.    The best course therefore seems to be to negotiateour treaty in three parts(a) a treaty of- alliance in the terms of annex II to this memorandum, which, has beenapproved by the interested Departments.In effect it would provide for an allianceon the Jordan model, and for themaintenance of the status quo but would avoid details which the General Assemblycould seize on.(b) A military agreement,  setting out the detailed requirements of our forces to be stationed in Libya..  (c)    A financial agreement setting out theterms (including the appointment ofspecial British adviser/controllers)on which we would subsidise the Libyanbudget.13.    On our present appreciation of the prospects inthe United Nations Assembly, I propose that only thefirst should be negotiated before the declaration ofLibyan independence.    In the last resort, we couldallow the Assembly to discuss (but not of course toamend) this document, but we should maintain that thefurther military and financial agreements foreseen init were not yet in existence and we should thereforerefuse to discuss them.
11+.    The United States Government propose to negotiate an agreement this year, including the terms of their occupation of Tripolitanian airfields, and theyapparently hope that such an agreement can he keptout of the United Nations debates;    it is impossible atpresent to say whether their hopes will be justified.In any case, their argument is likely to be lesscomplicated than the sum of our own arrangements withthe Libyans,    If, however, wc found that any debate onLibya in the General Assembly was certain to be postponed until after the declaration of independence, it might then be possible to complete all our agreements withthe competent Libyan Government before that debate.Go-operation with the United States authoritiesli .1    m    ..

This general appreciation of the problem has beenagreed informally with the United States authoritiesand there is the closest possible liaison between our two governments at the official level.    There will ofcourse be co-ordination of the British and United Statesapproaches to the Amir of Cyrenaica.Co-ordination with the French and Italian authorities16.    The French and Italian authorities are alreadyaware that His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to conclude atreaty with Libya, providing for military&quot;facilities and a subsidy to the Libyan budget;    and they have indicated that they see no objection.    In view of thefact that the French Government wish to maintain their special position in the desert region of the Fezzanand therefore intend to conclude an agreement withLibya, it will be necessary to show them our draft treaty and ultimately the military and financial agree-ments.    The Italian Government intend, according toour information, simply to conclude a treaty of friendship and commerce with Libya, and it may not benecessary to show them our drafts, but wo should keep them generally informed of our plans.
