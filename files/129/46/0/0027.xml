BAMANGWATO AFFAIRS: TSHEKEDI KHAMA

Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations

When I wrote my paper for the Cabinet (C.P.(51)173) I telegraphed to our High Commissioner&apos;s Office at Capetown to get their view on my assessment of probable reactions in South Africa to a return of Seretse and Tshekedi Khama. I attach my telegram and the answering telegram from Capetown. My colleagues will note that the view of the men on the spot differs from mine in that they think that reactions would be stronger than a year ago.

2. I also asked our officers if the return of Seretse and Tshekedi Khama would give rise to insuperable administrative difficulties in the Protectorate. I attach their reply. Our officers have strongly advised me in the past that the return of Tshekedi Khama alone would lead to serious and sustained trouble in the Reserve.

Outward Telegram from Commonwealth Relations OfficeTERRITORIES DEPT.CYPHER i; &apos;  . &quot;TO:    SOUTH AFRICA (B.B.S.)(SENT 22.15 hours, 21st June, 1951)immediate no. 274 - SECRETTSHEKEDIThe Opposition has    put down a motion which will be debated inthe House of Commons on Tuesday, 26th June.    This calls for withdrawalof the ban on Tshekedi&apos;s movements and for his return to the bamangwato Reserve,2.   This motion is likely to gain a lot of support.   Without beingalarmist,  I&quot;must give you warning&apos;that the Parliamentary situationis delicate and that it would be wise for us to consider thesituation t?hich would arise  if, despite our best endeavour the motionwere carried against us* &apos;3.   I am convinced that there is no compromise position on which wecould stand.   For obvious reasons negotiations could not be reopenedwith Tshekedi at this date.   Any new offer would merely encouragehim to ask for more and pave the way to his virtually unconditionalreturn to the Reserve.   A further enquiry, which would in effectamount to an enquiry into my decisions, would hopelessly unsettlethe Bamangwato.   Moreover any concession made now would inspireSeretse to press for similar treatment.    In the result the wholeof the White Paper policy would be endangered and probably becomeuntenable.    A piecemeal retreat would be more damaging than, a clean-cut reversal.\*   Therefore in the event of motion being carried&apos; the only course open would be to rescind all the White Paper decisions, permit,both Tshekedi and Seretse to return to the Reserve and allow thepeople to determine the future of the chieftainship at a furtherkgotla.   As you will realise I am anxious to have best possibleforecast of Union reactions in such an event.    Looked at from thisdistance it appears to me that there is not quite the same dangertoday that Seretse&apos;s return to the Reserve and his recognition as chief while still married to Ruth would lead to an explosion inthe Union.    As we see it the white population is less likely intoday&apos;s circumstances in the Union to become united and inflamedover it.   But the reactions of.the Union Government could nevertheless be sharp and they would presumably make (now and subsequently)the maximum political capital out of the reversal of our decision.  -If they were so minded they could presumably take action verydamaging to the Territories which other white South Africans wouldnot oppose and in which indeed many might tacitly acquiesce.    Suchaction, e.g. in the shape of economic sanctions and interferencewith communications, could if maintained make our continuedadministration of Swaziland and Bechuanaland very difficult and expensive and lead to severe crisis in Basutoland.5,   r realise that it is impossible for you to be in any way precisein forecasting reactions in.a matter like this.   But I should be grateful for your confirmation or otherwise by immediate telegram
of the tentative view expressed above.    Could .you let me know what you think&quot; the chances are that they will do things that would make an adminstration of the Territories difficult or even impossible,I should also welcome any other observations which you may have ona situation in which both Tshekedi and Seretse are allowed to returnto.the Reserve.    1 assume that irrespective of possible Unionreactions, no insuperable administrative difficulties would arisewithin the Protectorate.6.   Cabinet will be considering matter on Monday morning and yourreply should therefore reach me by early Sunday, 2h.th June.Copy to:-D.I.BAMANGWATO DISTRIBUTION
Inward Telegram to Commonwealth Relations OfficeIplotted to territories deft.cypherFROM:    SOUTH AFRICA (B.B.S.)D. Capetown 15.50 hours, 22nd June 1951R. .       18.30 hours, 22nd June 1951Immediateiso. 257.   secretYour telegram No, 274 Secret.i have had a word with High Commissioner by telephone andIfith his consent have discussed position with Strauss who confirms[accuracy of following assessment of likely Union reaction inIcircumstances you forecast.2.     Anti-British feelings would be more and not less repeat moreand not less inflamed and political reactions fiercer than they?rould have been in 1949.     To this following recent developmentscontribute:(1)(2)(3)Events in Gold Coast and Dr. Malan&apos;s interview on subject.Dr. Malanrs attack on British Press.His recent open advocacy of Republicanism.His statement that he is prepared to make future of high commission Territories an election issue.3.     Fundamentally white South Africans are at one on colour question.Return of Seretse with Ruth would be hot &quot;news&quot; and English languagepress, however reluctantly, would be forced to feature it in sameffay as would Afrikaans press with resultant high feelings among all sections of white population.kt     United Party differs from Nationalists on question of future of territories only on one point that Strauss ha3 no wish to beprovocative.     He would be able to do no more than counsel moderationamong his friends.     He could not openly oppose any action taken byNationalists in consequence of Seretse&apos;s recognition.     To do so would drive at.least some loyal South Africans over to Nationalistsand give thern that measure of local British support without whichthey cannot hope to achieve a republic.5.     Having confirmed all this Strauss added that in certaincircumstances, i.e,  (l) if South Africa were criticised in approachingUnited Nations Organisation debate (2) if Supreme Court declaresseparate Representation of Voters Act ultra vires and (3) Seretse is recognised Malan might even go to country on basis of &quot;no outsideinterference in Southern Africa&quot;,     He added that &quot;issue before British[Government is in short whether it is more important that Khamas shouldpeturn or that South Africa should, remain with the Commonwealth&quot;./ 6.    It,...,
6.     It has occurred to me too that though Malan has been very-correct over possible Central African Federation he may wish to seize an&apos; opportunity to force issue of Territories before a potentially powerful state with claims on one of them comes into existence on his borders.7.     It is impossible with any real hope of accuracy to forecastwhether Nationalists will fake measures to embarrass actualAdministration of Territories.     That they could do so is certainbut Territories possess at least two weapons, labour and meat supplies which though their use would make things even more difficult in       &apos;Territories would be very disturbing to Union and likely to makeMalan lose votes if he provoked their use.     The one, labour, v/oulclseriously affect industry and the other, meat, would make even moredifficult a matter which is already the object of political criticismMoreover Malan only tttis week dissociated himself from the threats of economic sanctions used by Hertzog.   - I would -expect that very helpful co-operation which we have recently received from UnionGovernment Departments would be withheld but at a guess repeat at aguess I would expect Malan to hold major measures in reserve for- use to force hand of His Majesty&apos;s Government after he had receivedmandate from country on issue of Territories.8,     I have repeated your telegram to High Commissioner and it mayreach him this evening but meanwhile you may be assured that foregoingsubstantially represents his views.     Rumbold. is already en route to Pretoria and I cannot consult him*9.     You are aware that Forsyth Secretary for External Affairs isin London and perhaps you would be prepared that someone shouldsound him on your behalf.      Strauss thinks it would be safe to do so,10.    I will reply about possible situation in reserve when I havebeen able to consult, Boetham.Copy to:D.IBAMANGWATO DISTRIBUTION

In Protectorate much would depend upon attitude of Tshekedi which might or might notbe conciliatory.    His influence on other chiefs would inany case he greats    In Reserve itself we must assume thatSeretse would he recognised as chief and it is at leastquestionable whether Tshekedi would seek to re-establishhimself there permanently at any rate until feelingsagainst him had died down, hut in any case administration would probably need to he reinforced.    In short, conditions would he unsettled and security measures would be necessaryhut Administration should be able to manage.     Ends,GoToy to;-     D, I,BAMANGWATO DISTRIBUTION
