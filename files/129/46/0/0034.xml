secret copy No.CP. (51) 18429th June, 1951CABINETSPAINMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs- I have been giving much thought to the possible effect on our policy towardsSpain of the &quot;forward policy&quot; towards that country recently adopted by theUnited States. The nature of the problem, and the conclusions to which I am led,are set out below; and I should be grateful for the views of my colleagues.Present British policy . This is briefly, that nothing should be done which might help Franco, and,in particular, that &quot; nothing shall be done which would be of assistance to theSpanish armed forces.&quot;Present American policy. This is aimed, first, at the acquisition of bases, and secondly at developingSpain&apos;s military potential. It took shape at an interview between the United states ambassador and Franco on 14th March, at which the latter (a) proposed a directagreement between the United States, Spain and Portugal (membership of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) being impracticable); (b) offered toagree to incur the obligations Spain would have incurred were she a member ofN.A.T.O. if the United States gave adequate military assistance to Spain; and(c) promised, pact or no pact, to send troops north of the Pyrenees if Spain wereproperly armed.      .   -        , &apos;4. Attempts by us and the French to dissuade the Americans from opening up these conversations, of which they informed us in advance, proved vain. the americans insisted that they were &quot; exploratory soundings &quot; to be followed by&quot; extensive consultations with us and the French and their own military authorities.&quot;Their consultations with their own military authorities have taken place, and theproposals communicated to us and the French are set out in Washington telegram.No. 1927 of 22nd June (Annex A). In brief, they want a bilateral agreement whichwould secure them, primarily, air-fields in Spain and Spanish Morocco; they donot at present propose to supply military equipment, but would offer economic aid.They now await our reactions.Possible British Policies5. Assuming that there is no question at present of Spain&apos;s admission toN.A.T.O., we are faced with four possible policies:. A. To try to induce the Americans to abandon their policy. .B. To tell them that they can go ahead if they like, but that we must adhere to our present policy.C. To urge them to go slow, and not to associate ourselves with them.- D. To associate ourselves with their policy in some form.6. These alternatives must be considered against the strategic, economic andpolitical background.40817B
-Strategic considerations &quot;7. The views of the Chiefs of Staff are set but in CCS. (51) 289 of 10th May(Annex B). The gist Of iheir conclusions is that, while the admission of Spain toN.A.T.O. is desirable in the long term, the only possibility in the short term wouldbe to agree to a bilateral agreement between the United States and Spain; and thatwe should associate ourselves with the agreement so as to obtain the maximumadvantages from it. The implications of &quot; association &quot; have been left vague bythe Chiefs of Staff; but it seems clear that what they want is to have the same rights to naval, and possibly air, bases as may be granted to the Americans. Such rights would presumably only be granted to us by Franco if the Americans were to insist on it as part of their deal; we have little if anything to offer in return.8. The principal advantages and disadvantages on wide strategic grounds ofour associating ourselves with a United States-Spanish agreement can be sum-marised as follows:  9.   Advantages (i) We must plan against the possibility of our Rhine strategy beingunsuccessful. In this event a bridge-head in Spain would be ofgreat value;(ii) We must keep open the Western entrance to the Mediterranean;(iii) Spanish ports and bases would assist the control of communications in the Western Mediterranean and Eastern Atlantic area; similarly,they must be denied to the enemy; ;(iv) Were the Americans to be alone in association with Spain, they wouldbe more tempted to think in terms of Pyrenean and perimeter,rather than Rhine, defence, than if they were joined by some european Power or Powers. Perimeter defence lays us wide opento air attack and, possibly, invasion. .,10.  Disadvantages (i) Possible diversion of United States arms and equipment to Spain frommore deserving areas;(ii) Western morale, and so Western defence potential, would suffer fromthe implication that Europe was to be defended on the Pyrenees,and from admission to Western ranks of undemocratic Spain (seeparagraph 25 below).11. In general, it will be observed that the strategic objectives are primarily concerned with precautionary measures against the eventuality of war. It is arguable that, so long as the &quot;cold war&quot; lasts, the advantages of these measures are outweighed by the disadvantages; and that in the event of war the necessary facilities would be made available anyway. But, just as; our Egyptian strategicpolicy is designed to make preparations in time of peace against the eventuality ofwar, there is a Case for pursuing a similar policy in regard to Spain.12. Apart from the wide strategic issues dealt with by the Chiefs of Staff, thepresent American policy is clearly incompatible with the Anglo-French-Americangentleman^ agreement&quot; to do nothing to strengthen the Spanish armed forces.This agreement has been faithfully observed by ourselves, though not quite sofaithfully by the Americans and the French. If the Americans proceeded to rearmSpain, its purpose would no longer be fulfilled, and we should be entitled, if we wished, to consider ouselves free to offer equipment and advice. A statement Ofthe disadvantages under which we labour in this matter is contained in Annex C.Economic Considerations13. Our present policy leaves us freedom to develop ordinary commercial relations with Spain to the maximum extent, save in the military field referred toabove. But this is a most important exception. Unless we can keep pace, at least in willingness to supply, with the Americans when they enter the military field, theywill almost certainly acquire, wide economic advantages at our expense. This isparticularly important since we are unable to supply Spanish needs in manycivilian fields.14. Our present policy does not allow the grant to Spain of credits other thanthose justified by normal commercial transactions. But the Americans will almost
certainly have to give Franco some kind of economic assistance in return for bases,and it would be dangerous to British interests to leave the Americans alone in this field. Our own bargaining position for the supply of essential requirements,e.g., wolfram, pyrites, iron ore is. already very weak and if the American positionwere to be strengthened to our disadvantage such supplies would be imperilled.The grant of economic aid gives a valuable opening for the establishment of closercontacts through which political influence might be exerted. It may not be possiblefor us to offer-more than small credits; but there is a case for urging that weshould consider ourselves free to do so. We might, for example, want to dffercredits to secure us long-term contracts for the pyrites essential to our fiye-yeafplan for producing sulphuric acid.Political Considerations15. These form the crux of the problem. Were it not for the political andideological issues involved, Spain would presumably already have been includedin the North Atlantic Pact. This is a case where ideological considerations are notin harmony with the requirements of defence.16. The subject is considered below from the angle of the United Kingdom,United States, France, Europe in general, and Spain.17. United Kingdom.-! need not dilate on the difficulties which anysubstantial modification in our present policy would entail. They are so great asto stand in the way of our attempting to make a change unless strategic considera-tions vital to our national defence compel us to do so.18. United States. The reasons for the American desire for a closer associa-tion with Spain are as follows&quot;  (1) The strength of popular feeling in favour of itThe Roman Catholic and Spanish lobbies are strong, and have long been active. The power of the Trades Unions in the United States is less effective in matters of this kind. There is far more popular support forassociation with Spain than there was for German rearmament.(2) The weakened position of the AdministrationMr. Acheson in particular, and the Administration in general, havetaken a lot of punishment, and can ill afford to go against well organised and vocal elements of public opinion over Spain.(3) Pressure from the PentagonThis is heavy and is prompted no doubt by the same considerationsas animated our Chiefs of Staff. (While a hankering after perimeterdefence is present in their thinking, as stated above, and while this willbe made much of in some countries in Europe, it seems unnecessary toimpute motives other than a natural desire to take all possibleprecautions against all eventualities.)19. These factors would make it impossible for the Administration to eattheir words (Mr. Acheson, General Bradley and others are on record in favour ofa closer association of Spain with the West.) To this extent it is impossible to.calloff the Americans (paragraph 5 A).20. But they are known to dislike to have to go dead against the wishes, ifreally vigorously expressed, of ourselves artd the French. Anglo-United Statesrelations, they sometimes feel, can if necessary weather such storms; but theyare always nervous of the French running out. Moreover, representations by us would be more effective if we appeared to be acting in an European capacity. Ifwe and the French who would have to do more than play second fiddle to us were to urge them to postpone the whole issue for, say, six months or even a year,their reaction might be to agree, or, alternatively, if they could not guarantee to postpone it altogether, to offer in return to go slow (paragraph 5 C). If thiscourse is to be our objective this would be the best means of reaching it. As theyare known to be primarily and immediately interested in securing bases and facilities in Spain and Spanish Morocco, and only secondarily and subsequently ininjecting arms and equipment, it might be possible to reach agreement on a go-slow40817 &quot; b 2
H- policy. But if- as does not seem likely-we cannot make certain of really vigorousFrench representations, course 5 C, Would be difficult.21. To let them go ahead alone and stand aside or dissociate ourselves(paragraph 5 B) would be to create and advertise a widening divergence between ourselves and them; Spain would be added to China as an obvious rift in Anglo-American relations.i 22. To accept their policy, and associate ourselves with it in some form(paragraph 5 D) would be the ideal solution from their point of view, but animpracticable one from our own.23. There are two other aspects of American policy which can be mentionedhere. There is the American tendency to assert predominant political influence inthe areas which they have decided are of strategic importance. -Turkey is an example, and we should not wish Spain to become another. There is also thetendency to take less interest than we do in the political liberalisation of Spain, andto concentrate rather on economic liberalisation with a view to the promotion oftrade. If the Americans are to press for political liberalisation and they alone arein a position to do so effectively they must first be pressed by us. They would belikely to be more receptive if we were acting in association with them. (See para-graph 26 below.)24. France.1 The new French Government, orientated rather more to theright, is likely to be more amenable than its predecessors to suggestions that thepolitical ostracism of Spain should be diminished. (The Quai d&apos;Orsay have already suggested, in deference to French commercial pressure, that the gentleman&apos;s agree-ment on banning military equipment should be more elastically interpreted.The new formula they suggest is to the effect that where equipment can be usedfor either military or civilian purposes, it should be banned or allowed accordingto whether it is more generally used for military or civilian purposes. To this Ipropose to agree.) French public opinion as a whole will, however, be strongly against any traffic with Franco. Both Government and public opinion would beviolently opposed to anything savouring of a decision to defend Europe on thePyrenees. It would be difficult, arid perhaps impossible, to get the French to swallowfull association with the American policy course 5 D. They might well agreeto course 5 C. To adopt course 5 D without them would put a severe strain on anglo-French relations, which would only be justified if the strategic argumentswere held to overrule the political ones.25. Fur ope in General. It is clear that any step to make closer the associa-tion of Franco Spain with the West would have repercussions on Western moraleas indicating a tendency to compromise on ideological principles. If the americans were to proceed too rapidly to build up Spanish defences, the impression wouldbe created that the intention was to defend Europe on the Pyrenees. If it is assumed that it is impossible to stop the Americans going ahead with their plans for closer association, then perhaps our association with their plans would do little more harm than would have been done already. But assuming that we can influenceAmerican policy, there are strong grounds for urging them to do nothing whichwould seriously damage Western morale. What is needed, in this phase of the&quot; cold war,&quot; is a steady build up of the moral and material force of the atlantic treaty countries. The Scandinavians, Belgians, Dutch and possibly Italians, as wellas the British and French, would be severely shaken by any overt and obviousdecision by the Americans, by unilateral action, to treat Franco as though he wereeligible for the Western Club.26. Spain. Some degree of liberalisation of the Spanish regime is desirablenot only ideologically, but also in the interests of the stability of Western Europe.So long as present tensions exist, there is the risk of a Communist Governmentemerging on France&apos;s southern flank. The Americans alone can exert effectivepressure on Franco, and even their chances of doing, so are small, since (a) theyseek another form of payment air and naval bases for the help they may give;(b) Franco knows how badly they want these bases, and can name his price;(c) Franco could hardly agree to announce measures of liberalisation in advance of,or openly: as the price of American assistance.27. Nevertheless, it might be worth trying to achieve some degree of liberalisa-tion, and if the United Kingdom and/or France were prepared to move forward
in association with the United States towards closer relations with Spain, thiswould be the time to try it.. The prospects are perhaps better now, whenFranco is faced with a serious economic situation and grdwihg discontent through-out Spain and when he is not certain that he will get economic help, than they willbe when he has got help from the United States alone. He will then have no incentive left to mollify the feelings of democratic European States. Some of themeasures which Franco could take are set out in Annex D.28; It may be said that the growing discontent referred to above is a signthat the regime is tottering to its fall, and that this is the last moment to choosefor shoring it up. The evidence, however, is that until the economic situation furtherdeteriorates very considerably, which it shows no sign of doing, horror of anothercivil war will enable Franco to remain in power. It would be a mistake to baseour policy on any contrary assumption. But the argument will not lack popularappeal.The Yugoslav Analogy29. The objections felt in Europe to any policy likely to assist Franco are basedpartly on the totalitarian character of his regime, and partly on the circumstances ofhis rise to power. Here a comparison between our Spanish and Yugoslav policies isof interest.30. Although Tito&apos;s regime is a Communist dictatorship, we are giving himeconomic and political support, and we have agreed in principle to supply him with arms. Our reasons are his hostility to Moscow, the dangers of his replacementby a Cominform Government, and the value of his armed forces. Franco&apos;s hostility to Moscow is as great as Tito&apos;s, the dangers of his replacement by a communist government also as great, and the potential of his ill-equipped forces considerable.Logically, he would seem to have a similar claim to Western support, as a valuableally against the U.S.S.R. But here the psychological effects of the different ways inwhich Tito and Franco rose to power make themselves felt. Franco&apos;s name recallsNazi and Fascist support; Tito&apos;s recalls resistance to the Germans and, later,to Moscow. Further, Tito is, we hope, aiming at the economic development of his people, whereas Franco seems to be ready to sacrifice this for the benefit of thecorrupt clique in power. Hence the differences in our treatment of the two problems,and the difficulty of a purely logical approach to the problem of Spain.Summary31. (i) It is strategically desirable that Spain should be more closely associatedwith the West.(ii) It is strategically desirable that we should be associated with any bilateralUnited States-Spanish arrangement.(iii) It is economically and politically undesirable that Spain should become an exclusive client of the United States.(iv) It is economically and politically desirable that we should be free to offercredits, and that the ban on supplies of arms and equipment should be reviewed.(v) It is politically undesirable that British and American policies shouldopenly diverge, or that the Americans should pursue a policy withoutdue regard for us.(vi). It is pohtically and strategically undesirable that Western morale shouldbe made to suffer a strain which would cancel out any strategicadvantages.(vii) It is politically desirable that some degree of liberalisation should beachieved in Spain.Conclusions :32. Strategically and economically, our best policy would be course 5 P association with a Spanish-United States bilateral agreement. But if political con-siderations over-ride the strategic case for precautionary measures, as I think theydo, then our best policy would be course 5 C, which we should try to achieve as an american concession in face of strong Anglo-French representations in favour of postponement. &apos; ,. .. ,
Recommendation33. (i) If course-5 D were to be adopted, we should open discussions withthe Americans and French with a view to association in any American arrangement with Spain, and, ultimately, with a view to bringing about an evolution of the regime. .(ii) If we fall back on course 5 C our first step would be to obtain from thenew French Government an absolute assurance of really vigorous representations,together with us, to the United States Government, urging that the whole issueshould be postponed for six months or a year. Our object would in fact be to extract, as a concession, a promise to move at a pace which would not put too great a strain on the morale of their Atlantic allies. They should confine themselvesto discussing, without too great a sense of urgency, eventual facilities for UnitedStales forces (to be paid for no doubt by military aid). At the same time theyshould press for steps towards liberalisation. Meanwhile, they should give thefullest priority to NATO countries and do nothing to lower Western morale.(iii) As the new French Government will not be formed before 5th July, andmay be ineffective for some time, we should, in agreement with them, tell the americans now that we should like to postpone a thorough discussion of thesematters till, say, August, and that we hope they will feel able to delay any positive action till then. (His Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Washington have already been instructed to explain that they will not be in a position to do more than listen,during the informal discussions with the Americans which are about to open, andthey will in general deprecate undue haste.)(iv) Unless course 5 A is adopted and the Americans abandon their forwardpolicy altogether, which I do not think is at all likely to-happen, we should considerourselves free to offer commercial credits, and we should review the present banon the supply of equipment for the Spanish armed forces. The French formulain paragraph 24 above should in any case be adopted.H. M.,  Foreign Office, S.W. 1,2%th June, 1951.ANNEX ATelegram No. 1927 of 22nd June, 1951 from Washington to Foreign OfficeMeeting took place on 21st June. Admiral Sherman and Perkins were principalspokesmen on United States side assisted by Air Force representative who arrivedlate and who had not been briefed. Air Chief Marshal Elliot and I were present on united Kingdom side but made it clear that we could only listen to what they hadto say.2.  The following picture of United States intentions emerged: -(a) The immediate United States objective in Spain is to obtain naval and air bases as follows:(i) The United States Navy want anchorage rights on both coasts of spain and in Spanish Morocco but do not at present requireshore bases, although it is realised that as anchorages are used,there will eventually be some spillover onto the shore in the form,eg. of recreational facilities.(ii) The United States Navy want the use of an air-field.  It shouldbe as close to the Straits as is feasible, both from the opera-tional point of view and to facilitate co-ordination with air forcesat Gibraltar. Although no firm decision has been taken, theyare thinking of Spanish Morocco and more particularly ofTetuan. In reply to questions, Sherman said that an airfield was required near the Straits as a supplement to Lyautey, whichwas too far away, and Gibraltar, which in the event of hostilities,did not have sufficient capacity as regards either numbers orsize of aircraft. He added that they did not want to have to rely exclusively on French Morocco.
(iii) The United States Air Force want the use of about three airfieldsprobably at Madrid, Barcelona and Seville as part of their over-all system of air deployment.(b) As regards (ii) and (iii) above, the Americans thought it preferable to make. use of existing airfields rather than to construct United States bases.This would minimise political complications. They would not takeover the whole airfields but would at present require-(i) operating rights, including the right to free entry and storage of .P.O.L.  and  operational  supplies   (including,  if necessary,ammunition).(ii) the right to station minimum personnel for refuelling and main-tenance. &apos;(iii) the right, where necessary, to improve facilities.(iv) minimum jurisdictiohal and personal exemptions.  They want tobe able to use the airfields in peace time for staging purposes  ,and in the course of training, but they would require the rightto use them operationally in war.(c) It is the United States intention to work out a bilateral arrangement butin such a way that it can later be extended into a multilateral agree-ment.(d) No decision has yet been taken on the method of approach to the SpanishGovernment. The United States military authorities are, however,thinking of an approach on the military level in the first place and Sher-man himself may go to Spain for this purpose.(e) As regards the quid pro quo which Franco would undoubtedly require:&apos; (i) The Americans, are thinking in terms of economic aid and assistancein developing airfields in which they are interested and com-munications.(ii) They realise, however, that Franco may demand military equip-ment and help in building up the Spanish armed forces. Noequipment was available for Spain at present, but Franco might at least require assurances as regards the future. This was a ,more difficult problem since anything involving the Spanishforces and their use was a European problem which they would want to discuss in a N.A.T.O. framework.(/) Little consideration seems to have been given to political situation withinSpain, apart from recognition that considerable economic aid will berequired if present discontent is not to increase.(g) The Americans want to handle this matter with as much secrecy as possible(although there is already a good deal of, to put it mildly, accuratespeculation) and in particular to keep it out of .Congress and theN.A.T.O. Deputies. They would, however, make a statement to the deputies if (i) there was a serious leakage or (ii) the question ^ of spanish forces cropped up (see (/) (ii) above). I asked if it was at leastintended to make a statement to the Deputies before final agreement was announced. They clearly had not intended to do so but under-took to reconsider this.3. My comments are as follows. It would appear that the State Departmenthave been pushed into this by the combination of the Defence Department withthe Spanish lobby. At lunch, immediately after the meeting, the Sunday TimesCorrespondent, who has his nose deeply in the Defence Department, volunteered tome that a decision to approach Franco had been taken about ten days ago and it was evident at the meeting that the Defence Departments plans were a good deal fur-ther advanced than the State Departments. In fact, we got nothing concrete out ofthe State Department and their intervention so far would appear to have been limited to insistence on consultation with us and the French. (In this connexion, I pointed out that Franco was just as abhorrent to many of the minor N.A.T.O.powers, like Norway, as to the French).4.   On the whole, this looks more like a foot in the door by the navy and :air force than anything else.   Not only was the army not represented^ but bothPerkina and Sherman contemplated with evident reluctance the probability thatFranco would ask for arms for his troops as his quid pro quo.   There was no
mention of any strategic role for Spain in war, the Pyrenees, &amp;c. On the whole,-although I feel pretty sure that they will go through with it, I think this project isat a fairly half-baked stage, and the leakages which have already occurred indicatehow far it is the result of internal politics here. I do not think either the State orDefence Departments have any idea of the difficulties they are going to encounterin negotiations.5. No arrangements have been made for further meetings on the military or political side, but if you have any views which you wish us to put, I would propose to seek a further joint meeting.6. Owing to the French elections, French Embassy have only just gotauthority to attend a meeting. French Government are perturbed that americans are handling this matter on a bilateral rather than a tripartite basis, and FrenchEmbassy were instructed to concert with us and to try to arrange for a tripartite meeting. Their instructions in this sense arrived too late, but you will doubtlessbear this aspect in mind in giving me further instructions.ANNEX B[COS.

EWBANK.Ministry of Defence, S.W. 1,10th May, 1951.AnnexRelationship of Spain to the Defence of Western EuropeIntroductionIn June 1950 the Chiefs of Staff considered the question of the inclusion of spain in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. They concluded that in the longterm the advantages of including Spain in N.A.T.O. would outweigh the- disadvantages. In the short term, however, they recognised that there might be serious political reactions on the morale of Western European countries if Spainwere awarded membership prematurely, and her inclusion might also involve a diversion of equipment to her at the expense of other countries. They suggestedthat the ultimate desirability of including Spain in N.A.T.O. should be borne inmind when framing a future policy towards her.2. It has now become necessary, in the light of the recent American approach to Spain and the present world situation, to re-examine the question of associatingSpain with Western Defence.* C.O.S. (51) 73rd Meeting, Minute 2.
Changes in the Situation since the last Examination ,3. Since last June, when this question was previously examined, the deterioration-^tion of the international situation has brought about-   ;(a) An acceleration of Western defensive preparations, of which the mainmanifestation is the immense scale of American rearmament.(b) A realisation at least by the United States and the United Kingdom, thatthe moment of the greatest danger of war may come at the end of1952. This contrasts with the previous United Kingdom view that theSoviet Union would probably not be prepared to risk war before 1955.(c) The establishment of S.H.A.P.E. under General Eisenhower and the resulting increased emphasis on the urgent need to build up a strongWestern European defence.(d) An acceptance of the principle of German rearmament.Events Affecting the Relationship of Spain to the West4. The question of associating Spain with Western defence has recently beenbrought into the foreground by the following events: -(a) The decision of the United: Nations to rescind the 1946 Resolution- recommending the withdrawal of ambassadors from Spain, and the subsequent appointment of United Kingdom and United StatesAmbassadors. -(b) The United States Ambassador in Madrid has been authorised to make anexploration of the Spanish attitude towards defence against an aggressor,and he has already had one audience with General Franco on thesubject. This is the most recent manifestation of the increased Americaninterest in Spanish participation in Western defence.(c) At the above meeting, General Franco intimated that the best solutionunder present circumstances might be a direct agreement outsideN.A.T.O. between the United States, Spain and Portugal.(d) At the same meeting General Franco said that under any circumstances,and irrespective of whether there were any pacts, Spain would sendSpanish forces to fight north of the Pyrenees, if they were properlyarmed. The Portuguese Ambassador to Madrid, however, maintainsthat it would be a mistake to suppose that General Franco had givenMr. Griffis any firm undertaking of this kind.(e) The Portuguese told General Eisenhower during his recent tour of N.A.T.O.countries that, so long as Spain was not in N.A.T.O., they were in effectan island as far as Europe was concerned. They stressed that theirculture and economy were closely tied to Spain.(/) General Eisenhower has recently expressed the view that the participation of Spain in the defence of Western Europe would have to be considered in the not too distant future.Strategic Importance of Spain5. Spain is strategically important to the Western Allies for the following main reasons:  (a) Her geographical position.(b) As a source of raw materials.(c) Her reserves of military man-power and the potential value of the Spanisharmed forces.These are discussed below.6. Geographical Position. Spain occupies an important geographical posi-tion particularly in relation to Allied sea communications in the Western Mediter-fanean and Eastern Atlantic areas. The availability of Spanish ports and airfieldswould be of assistance in the control of sea communications in these areas. If theFrench Atlantic coast fell into enemy hands, use of Spanish bases would be ofconsiderable value in meeting the increased submarine and air threat to Alliedconvoys.If Russia were to occupy Spain;she would gain valuable, naval and air basesfrom which to intensify her operations against Allied sea communications in the atlantic; and by closing the Straits of Gibraltar, she could deny the western mediterranean to Allied shipping, which, coupled with an occupation of Italy,40817 c
would place her in a favourable position to invade North Africa. Furthermore,once Spain is occupied the defence of Portugal becomes impossible and additionalAtlantic ports would fall into enemy hands.   ; &apos;. In the event of the collapse of the Allied position in Western Europe, by far thebest natural defence barrier is the Pyrenees. This position is very strong defen-sively, but owing to the narrow exits at both ends of the mountain barrier it hasdisadvantages as a base from which to launch a major land offensive into France.However, if the line of the Pyrenees could be held, it would have the great strategicadvantage, in, the short term of enabling us to maintain a front in Europe, to keep a foothold on the European mainland, and to keep open the entrance to the western mediterranean. -7. Raw Materials. Spain possesses reserves of sulphur, iron ore, pyrites,wolfram and mercury which would be valuable to our war economy, and we wouldnot Wish them to come under enemy control., ,8. Reserves of Military Man-power and Potential Value of Spanish armed forces-r-The peace-time strength of the Spanish Army is about 400,000 men. Itconsists of T8 divisions and 4 independent mountain brigade groups. Of the 18divisions 4 are mountain divisions. The mountain troops are of good quality, and could take the field.immediately if employed in mountain warfare only. Morale,is in. general high throughout the army, and the men are tough and good fighters.In war the peak figure of reserves is believed to be 1,200,000. The high command,however, is weak, the training of the whole army is out of date by modern standards,and equipment is inadequate and antiquated. Until the army has been re-equipped and trained, it is most unlikely that it would be able to hold the Pyrenees against theRussians, but might fight a useful delaying action provided it was given a measureof support, particularly in the air.Although the Spanish Navy suffers from the same defects as the army in the lack of modern equipment and training, it is a substantial well disciplined force,which if given the necessary technical assistance could play a useful role in thedefence of sea communications in the Atlantic and Mediterranean.The Spanish air force is out of date in its equipment and techniques, and its military value is very small.9. Deduction. Spain&apos;s present weakness would not allow her to contributeappreciably towards holding an allied bridgehead in the Iberian peninsula, in theevent of our Rhine strategy being unsuccessful. At the best her forces might fighta valuable delaying action, provided they were.given a measure of support, particu-larly in the air. Provided the Spanish armed forces receive outside military aid inthe near future, they might be able to make a useful contribution to the defence of spain in the short term and of Western Europe in the medium term; in their present condition their military value is small.- We therefore consider that, because of the increased international tension andin view Of the fact that the greatest danger of war is likely to arise before we are capable of holding the Rhine line, there are considerable advantages in associatingSpain with Western defence in the short term from the strategic point of view.Method of Association of Spain with Western Defence10. The obvious method of associating Spain with Western Defence in the medium term would be to admit her to N.A.T.O., but we understand that, howeverstrong the military arguments for this course, political considerations at present ruleit out. The only feasible alternative appears to be a bilateral agreement outsideN.A.T.O. between Spain and the United States.. 11. The conclusion of such an agreement would imply American military (and presumably economic) aid for Spain in return for an undertaking by General Francoto participate in Western defence and to allow the United States the use of air and naval bases. There Would be no military contact between Spain and the other western Powers, although there would undoubtedly be unofficial contacts throughthe United States between General Eisenhower and the American authorities in spain. It would also probably be found necessary to include Portugal in theSpanish-American agreement: British and French military personnel would be unable to use Spanish territory and military facilities in peace time; although it ishoped that we should be able to regain our. former use of naval facilities in Spain.Spanish forces could not be deployed in Western Europe before war broke out.
Effect on Allied Interests of a Bilateral Pact.12.I ,The strategic advantages, of associating Spain with Western defence are set out at paragraph 9 above. A possible^^additrbnal advantage of assdciatihgherby means of, a bilateral United States-Spanish pact is that, in the short term it wouldbe ppssi.ble,tO plan to hold a position in Spain without upsetting other allies.; Thiswould not be possible under N.A.T.O. , &apos; &apos;13.  Disadvantages:- .   , \ /    .;-fyjr)J American, arms and equipment\which should gd to; assist the bhild-up. under S.H.A.P.E. would be diverted to Spain in the short term. .(b) The N.A.T.O. Powers would have no way of knowing how muchAmerican Military and economic aid was going to Spain and theymight well suspect that their interests were being sacrificed to help the Spaniards.       &apos;(c) Spain, and to a lesser extent, Portugal would become an Americansphere of influence.id) The Western European Powers, particularly France, might well suspectthat the United States was preparing a second line of defence inthe Pyrenees. In which case their confidence in N.A.T.O. might be weakened. &apos;-, &apos;(e). There would be an accentuation of the difference already existing between the Western European Powers and Spain; this wouldlessen the chances of resuming normal relations between the Britishand Spanish Armed Forces and make the: task of eventual restora-tion of cordial relations even more difficult of achievement.14. Were it possible for us in some way to be associated with the UnitedStates/Spanish pact several of the above mentioned disadvantages would bereduced. .      :,Desirability of a Bilateral Agreement15. As shown above, we consider it important that Spain, should be associatedwith Western defence in the short term as soon as possible. The proposed bilateral agreement is the only step in this direction apparently likely to be taken in the hearfuture, and the strategic advantages of such a move would be well worth having.16. On the other hand, the dangers are plain. They amount to a generalweakening of the JN.A.T.O. concept, and to American predominance in; an area which is of considerable strategic interest to us. &apos;\&quot;17. There appear to be two courses open. The first is: to oppose the bilateral agreement on the grounds that the dangers are too great. This, if accepted by the americans, would mean the abandonment of any hope of associating Spain withthe West for some time, since no other method appears feasible. Since it is clear,however, that the Americans are intent on reaching a military understanding withGeneral Franco, it is doubtful whether they would be deflected from their purpose by any objection put forward by the United Kingdom. It would therefore be useless to oppose the American pact as our opposition would only harm Anglo/American relations and accentuate the dangers described above.18 For these reasons we consider that we must adopt the second course,namely to agree to a bilateral agreement.19. The dangers of such an agreement are considerable and to reduce themwe consider that we should;- in some way, be associated with the agreement, perhap seven on a tripartite basis, in an endeavour to obtain the maximum militaryadvantage without attendant political disadvantages.,, ;.- .f    ...    , .&apos;; 20. We consider, however, that an admission ,df Spain, to. JST.A.T,0.; would notincur ahy of the disadvantages of a bilaterial pact,-except that equipment might be diverted to Spain from the other NA-T-O-Jcountries^M The strategic- advantageswould moreover be considerably greater; i We are therefore; I convinced; that theonly satisfactdry military solution to the assdciation:of Spain with western defence is to admit her to N.A.T.O. We feel-; strongly that a Spanish-American bilateralagreement1 would be a dangerous and&apos; -unsatisfactory alternative, but \ as: the. onlyavailable course we should not Oppose.it, and in order to minimise the dangers weshould endeavour to be associated with it.  ^       ,i  -;:   ^     ,.t , ;140817   &apos; &quot;! - -: &apos;v m r-- g 2&apos;&apos;: i-
Conclusions21.  We conclude from the military point of. view that: -(a) Because of the increased international tension, and&apos;in view of the fact thatthe greatest danger of war is likely to arise before we are capable of holding the Rhine line there are considerable advantages in associatingSpain with Western Defence in the short term from a strategic point ofi view.(b) The only satisfactory solution to the association of Spain with the defenceof Western Europe, in the long term is to admit her to N.A.T.O.(t) In the short term, although there are strong arguments against such acourse, the only possibility would be to agree to a bilateral agreementbetween United States and Spain.(d) Since it is clear that the Americans are intent on reaching a military under-standing with General Franco it would therefore be useless to oppose the American pact as our opposition would only harm Anglo/american relations.(e) In order to reduce the dangers to us inherent in a bilateral agreement weshould associate ourselves with the agreement so as to obtain themaximum advantages from it..   ANNEX CNote on the Policy regarding the supply of Arms and Equipment to spain and the giving of information to spanish service attaches1.   Our policy on 23rd October, 1945, the Cabinet agreed that no weapons of war should besupplied to Spain, and that in order to restrict the export of goods of a semi-military character to those manifestly required for civilian use, all exports to Spain of goodsin Group 17 of the Export of Goods Control (No. 7) Order 1945, should be made subject to license. At the same time it was decided that the policy should be to refrain from giving the Spaniards any information or facilities which would strengthen their armed forces. The basis of this policy was that any step which increased the efficiency of the armed forces tended directly to strengthen the franco regime.This policy was reaffirmed by the Secretary of State in a conversation withMr. Hankey in November 1949, and is governed by the Cabinet decision of 5th September, 1950, that there should be no change in our general policy towardsSpain.As a result of the ban we have sent no military equipment to Spain since 1945,of indeed since the Civil War, and we have sent no civilian equipment which isadaptable &quot;for military use, unless we are reasonably satisfied that it will only beused for civil purposes. The Service Ministries have standing instructions to give no information to Spanish attaches which will serve to increase the efficiency ofthe Spanish armed forces.2.   Policy of other countriesWhen our policy was being considered in 1945 we kept in close touch withthe State Department who agreed to follow very much the same criteria as ourselves in the matter of supplies to Spain. As far as we can tell the Americans have sofar remained loyal to this agreement, but in April 1950 Washington informed us that the State Department were coming increasingly to the belief that a review ofUnited States policy towards Spain was necessary and that &quot;the question of thesupply of military equipment can only be satisfactorily dealt with if it is fitted intothis policy appraisal.&quot; It is evident from the Griffis-Franco conversations thatthey have in fact revised their policy towards Spain and we cannot therefore expectthem to continue to adhere to the agreement.The majority of other countries in Europe have shown themselves in the pastready to follow the Anglo-American line. The French, however, while officiallyagreeing to do so have been somewhat less scrupulous in these matters when it is aquestion of choosing between interest and principle.
3.   Practical application of the policy the following are a number of important cases in which the policy has&apos;been applied to the commercial disadvantage of British firms:-(a) Technical assistance by Messrs. Vickers Armstrong. We have consistentlyrefused permission for this firm to supply, with blue-prints, for the installation of obsolete naval guns, their Spanish affiliated company&quot; Sociedad Espanola de Construccion Naval,&quot; which are principallyemployed in the manufacture of warships. We have also refused thempermission for any of their technicians to go to Spain to give advice-Both these services are included in the terms of the long-standingagreement between the two companies. Recently the managing director of the S.E.C.Nf visited this country and as Messrs. Vickers,after reference to the Foreign Office, were still unable to give him the help required, it is probable that he will look elsewhere and come toa similar agreement with Bofors of Sweden or Hazemeyers of Holland.The Spanish Ministry of Marine have already concluded a generalagreement for the manufacture under license of Bofors patents.(b) Supply of Rolls Royce Jet Engines. We have had requests from time totime from Rolls Royce, through the Ministry of Supply, for permission to sell a sample obsolete jet engine to the Spanish Institute National deTechnica Aeronautica. These have been consistently refused on theground that jet engines, as opposed to piston engines, are of more mili-tary than civilian utility. This position is, however, hardly tenable now&apos; in view of the widespread use of jet engines in civil aircraft, and the. policy has prevented Rolls Royce from exploiting the Spanish market for jet engines which they have not the resources to manufacture them-selves. Recent information indicates that the Americans have beenfreely demonstrating jet aircraft in Spain and arousing considerable interest.(c) Supply of Rolls Royce Merlin Engines.-\n August 1950 Rolls Royce were invited by the Spanish Air Ministry to supply a number of Merlin 500engines, but were informed that export licences would not be issued.(d) Supply of Cheetah Aircraft Engines. We originally permitted the supplyof these engines for use in civil aircraft, but on hearing last year thatthere was some possibility of the engines having been used for militarytraining aircraft we have stopped further supplies.(e) Supply of Radar equipment. We have, of course, prevented the sale to spain of any military radar equipment and for civil radar it has beenour policy to insist on a guarantee Of civilian end use. From information which we have received it seems very probable that the Dutch firm ofPhillips have been supplying to Spain radar equipment of British design of which they obtained the plans during the war, although it has not beenpossible, for obvious reasons, to obtain proof.(/) Supply of other Items of Equipment. -In addition to the above the banhas operated to prevent the sale to Spain of a number of miscellaneousitems such as ex-naval speed boats, submarine equipment, &quot; shock^eliminators &quot; for paratroops, &amp;c.4. Effects of the Policy on British Commercial InterestsIn the short term our interests in selling goods of this type in Spain are notvery great since they are unlikely to produce any immediate substantial returns.Spain is chronically short of sterling as well as of dollars, and other hard currencies,while the amount of Spanish produce we can take is limited by its comparativeexpensiveness. Moreover, we have the rearmament drive at home to consider,In the long term, however, our interests in the Spanish market are considerable.The country has little heavy industry, but is a producer of valuable primary products, e.g., iron ore. Since the last war eliminated German influence, themarket has remained unexploited by any one of the industrial powers. The time will come, however, when any market that will take our goods will be valuable to us.There is, therefore, an obvious interest for us to ensure now, as far as we can, thatBritish firms shall be able to compete in the Spanish market on terms at least as favourable as those of other nations, as soon-as other considerations permit. Ifwe let the-door close against us completely now, we shall and it difficult, if not impossible, to reopen it later. Rolls Royce Limited and Vickers Armstrong Limited.
fdr example, both still have contacts in Spanish air and shipbuilding circlesrespectively; butboth are afraid their influence may be usurped by non-british firms who, for one reason or another, may be better able to do business. . &apos;The Board of Trade arid Ministry of Supply are known to concur withthese views.   : &quot;-&apos; V :\&apos; -;   -&apos; -      &apos;-i/-.&apos;^-      \.r-: ..-5. Effect of the refusal to supply information to Spanish Service AttachesGood relations between the services of friendly countries are dependent on the interchange of information about service matters within the limits enjoined bysecurity, arid at present we cannot in theory supply the Spanish armed forces withanything more than we would give to Russia and her satellites. This not onlyprevents us from obtaining from the Spaniards information which might be useful to us but means that the basis of any ultimate co-operation between the forces ofthe two countries will be much more difficult to establish.,   ANNEX DPossible Measures of Liberalisation by the Franco Regime in Spain(Madrid Despatch No. 206 of 18th July, 1950)(WS 1051/23)The following steps, in ascending order of difficulty from Franco&apos;s point ofview, could be taken by him without imperilling his regime, which would thenapproximate to that of Dr. Salazar.1. Restriction of censorship to cover Communist propaganda or writingscalculated to cause disorder.At present it dictates what shall appear in the press.2. Restriction of use of military courts to cases of sabotage, revolutionarysubversion, banditry, attempts on the life of the Head of the State and a few of themost serious offences. All other cases to be tried before civil courts, which, if neces-sary, should be reformed to take the strain.At present all cases of illegal political activity are tried by military courts,where defendants cannot even choose a lawyer but may select an offer to defendthem from a list of six.i 3. Security of the person, as provided for in the 1945 Charter (Fuero de losEspanoles), which lays down that arrested persons must be brought before a magis-trate within 72 hours. -At present anyone may be arrested and imprisoned indefinitely without trial.Another clause of the Charter entitles the Government to suspend the aboveguarantee whenever necessary.4. Right Of association. Steps should be taken gradually and progressivelyto allow public meetings, provided notice is given in advance, that it is clear whois responsible for each meeting, and that incitement to disorder is punished.At present meetings of more than twelve people cannot be held without policepermission.I1 5. Reform of the Syndicates, so as to ensure that they are efficiently andhonestly run by experts.At present they are controlled by the spivs and drones of the Falange, whosecorruption is a byword.6   Religious freedom of Protestants and other denominations.At present Article 6 of the 1945 Charter forbids the public exercise of anybut the Roman Catholic religion. This is in line with the traditional bigotry of spain.
/7. Move away from Totalitarianism. One or two &quot; safe &quot; political parties should be allowed to develop, e.g., a Christian Socialist J?arty, which would enablesome degree of political discussion in the Cortes and outside. (Complete freedom in all political parties would lead to confusion and disorder.)At present the Falange has a complete monopoly of political activity. No other party may exist. The Falange pervades and controls the whole fabric of the State.It is highly unpopular in the country, because of the corruption with which it hasbecome synonymous. ,8. Increase in elected element of the Cortes, and free elections, to enable alarger section of Spanish opinion to express its views.: At present one-third is elected by the Falangist-controlled syndicate; the restare nominated by Franco or elected by ^Franco&apos;s nominees.
