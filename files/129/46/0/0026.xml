Section 27 reproduces similar provisions of the old Unemploy-ment Insurance Acts and extends them to cover contingencies for which other benefits are provided in the new scheme.    No use of the provisionshas so far been made, and the present is the first serious proposal thatthey should be used.3. The primary object of the provisions was not to enableemployers to get round the Truck Acts as the Minister of Fuel and Powersuggests.    It was to enable the offices of my Department to co-operate in the administration of approved schemes of benefits supplementary tothose provided by the National Insurance Acts agreed upon between employers and workpeople.    There are corresponding provisions in theIndustrial Injuries Insurance Act under which one scheme has so far beenapproved - the Colliery &quot;Workers1 Scheme referred to in the Minister of fuel and Power&apos;s paper.    Approval was sought and given in that caseprimarily to enable the local National Insurance offices to pay the benefits of the scheme along with those under the national scheme.4. The miners&apos; pension scheme now under discussion is to be administered throughout by the National Coal Board (N.C.B.); myapproval by Order under the 1946 Act is sought simply to give the N.C.3.the legal power to deduct the necessary contributions from the wages ofthe workmen covered by the scheme without securing the prior consentwhich the Truck Acts require in other cases.    While this may be legallypossible, it is certainly not what was in mind when the Act was framed,and it seems an unusual use of such powers.    In fact under the terms ofthe Act I should be accepting considerable responsibilities for thefinancial soundness of the scheme.5. To give the N.C.B. the authority they seek, the terms of theNational Insurance Act require that the details of the scheme shall be embodied in a draft Order and be approved by Affirmative Resolutions in both Houses of Parliament before it could come into force.    SimilarResolutions would be necessary for any future amendment of the scheme,however trifling.
Objections to the proposed course6. It appears to me that the Government might encounter serious political difficulty in presenting this scheme to Parliament on affirmative resolutions.    The scheme is both complex and wide-ranging;  includingas it does benefits for retirement, disability and death, it cannot fail tocall forth in Parliament awkward comparisons with the provisions madefor other workers - not only in respect of its benefits but of such matters as the sharing of contributions between worker and employer, and thevery generous back-service credits.    Particularly awkward might becomparisons with the treatment of war pensioners.7. A more fundamental objection is that the presentation of thisscheme for approval by Parliament cannot fail to prejudice most seriously the proposed enquiry into the whole question of supplementary-pensions on which the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is meetingthe Trades Union Congress on Tuesday, 26th June.    The approval whichthe Minister of Fuel and Power must in any case give under the Coal-mines Act does not, in my view, imply positive Government approval ofthe principles of the scheme to anything like the same extent as approvalunder the National Insurance Act; the Minister of Fuel and Power&apos;approval can readily be explained as being no more than his agreement to the assumption by the N.C.B. of the financial liabilities involved.8. The Minister of Fuel and Power may be taking the view that,since there is in the National Insurance Act statutory provision for theapproval of schemes arrived at by industrial negotiation, my action is no more than a formality and implies no decision of Government policy onthe merits of those schemes.    I have not taken this view;  I considerthat approval under Section 27 must mean that the scheme is in line with government policy and. with the provisions of the National Insurancescheme.    This scheme is, however, an exception to general government policy and, until the whole question has been reviewed, ought not in my view to be put on a statutory basis.9. The fact that the scheme is now to apply to all colliery surface workers makes the position, in my view, more difficult in respect of all -the considerations mentioned in paragraphs 6-8,10. While my main objections are as set out above, there may be serious industrial disadvantages in bringing provisions which affect theindustrial relations of the mining industry at so many points within thestrait waistcoat of statutory provisions which can only be altered by affirmative Resolutions, and, in present political circumstances, not without controversy.An alternative basis10. The difficulty about the Truck Acts is not new;  it arises inrelation to almost every scheme of contributory pensions coveringmanual workers: and I am not clear why it should be necessary for miners to be placed in a position in relation to that Act different fromother workers.    There is no evidence that the difficulties which theN.C.B. and the National Union of Mineworkers (N.U.M.) fear have inpractice proved to be serious in a very wide range of pension schemesfew of which are bacxed by authorities in such a strong position to securecompliance as the N.C.B. and the N.U.M.    Some of these schemes are
those which the N.U.M, refer to as embodying the compulsory principle(see paragraph 4 of the Annex to C.P,(51) 171).    The general procedure in these cases is, I understand, for the employer to obtain from eachworker an authority to make the appropriate deductions from his wagesand an undertaking to abide by the Rules of the scheme.    As the Ministerof Fuel and Power points out, the Truck Acts make it necessary to giveexisting miners some choice in the matter unless the N.C.B. is preparedto take the further step of offering fresh contracts of employment.    Butmembership of the scheme could be made a condition of employment for new entrants and the Rules of the scheme could prevent all who had accepted membership withdrawing from the scheme without the consentof the Board, so long as they remained in its employment.11. I am surprised that there should be the suggestion that therewill be widespread unwillingness in the mining communities to come intothis very generous scheme.    The sixggestion hardly accords with theearlier advocacy of the scheme as a means of attracting men to theindustry and keeping them there.    If, however, there is this widespreadunwillingness, I find some difficulty in seeing how it can be completelyovercome unless the N.C.B. is prepared in the last resort to terminate the employment of those who object.    Even if the Minister of Fuel and power&apos;s suggestion was adopted it would not be practical politics to prosecute under the National Insurance Act those who were unwilling topay, and it could hardly produce good industrial relations in the industryif large numbers of men unwilling to enter the scheme found that its con-tributions were deducted from their wages without their consent.12. I am also surprised to see from the Annex to C.P.(51) 171 thatthe N.U.MI. should have been left under the erroneous impression that ifthere is default in payment of contributions by miners the actuarialsoundness of the scheme will be imperilled.    The Government Actuary,who is also Actuary to the scheme, has given a clear assurance that thisis not so; he has said that, on the contrary, the finances of the scheme would be strengthened by any failure to pay or to pay regularly, since theN.C.3. would not then have to pay their contribution matching that of the insured worker.13. In short, my conclusion is that if the scheme is likely to prove asunpopular as is suggested among the younger miners the only practicalalternatives are either not to proceed with the scheme at all, or to allowit to proceed in the same way as schemes in other industries and services, leaving it to the N.C.B. and the N.U.M. to exercise all properpersuasion on those who are so short-sighted as to refuse to join.There is surely a serious danger that if contributions are deducted fromlarge numbers of unwilling men without their authority the effect can onlybe to create discontent leading to wage claims designed to recover thedeductions which, if granted, would leave the N.C,Bi to bear the whole cost of the scheme.ECMinistry of National Insurance, s.w.1,-22ND JUNE, 1951.
