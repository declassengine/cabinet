(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; 3 GOVERNMENT)GOJFIEEMTIAI0. P. (51 ) 20819TH JULY, 1951JAPANESE PEACE TREATY:DISPOSAL OF JAPANESE ASSETS IN THE UNITED kingdom memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will recall that this question was con-sidered on 23rd April, in connection with the draft of a state-rnent to be made in Parliament on the Governments decision thatthe Japanese Peace Treaty should not contain a provisionobliging     Japan to pay compensation for individual claims arising outside Japan.      The Cabinet then decided that it wasnot desirable to make a full statement of His MajestyTs Govern-menfs decision, but that the main points of the draft statement should be made in the debate on the All Party Motion on thequestion of compensation for former Far Eastern prisoners-of-war which was to be debated on 10th May (CM. (50 30thConclusions, Minute k).2. One of the main points made in this debate &quot;was thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government were considering whether the net valueof Japanese assets in this country might be used for the endow-ment, or otherwise for the benefit, of organisations and institutions whose work had been and could be of value in helpir.those in the United Kingdom who had suffered and the dependantsin the United Kingdom of those who had died as a result ofcaptivity or internment in enemy hands during the war.3* This proposal had a luke-warm reception in the House,as not really meeting the claim for compensation from theJapanese.      However,  I have since been able to announce, on12th July, that under the draft Peace Treaty Japan*s assets in neutral and ex-enemy countries will be transferred to the Inter-national Committee of the Red Cross for distribution at its dis-cretion among those prisoners of war who suffered at Japanesehands.      In the meantime, our suggestion of 10th May for dis-posing of the Japanese assets in this country has been further examined by the Departments concerned.h. The net value of Japanese assets in the UnitedKingdom has been estimated at some  1,250,000.      But of thisrather less than  900,000 will be available for disposal within six months after the Peace Treaty with Japan comes into force.The remainder will only become available as and when the liquidation of certain Japanese businesses in this country canbe completed;    this will take some time, and no exact estimateof the proceeds can be made.5. I consider that it would best satisfy public opinionif this sum of money, though relatively small, were distributed to charitable organisations for the relief of individual casesof special need among sufferers from the late war, particularly among those captured or interned by the enemy, or their dependants.COPY NO.CABINET
6. Any such scheme of disti*ib\rbion, however,  is open tothe f ollov/in g ob j ect i ons: -(a) the selection of organisations for this purpose ishound to be a difficult and invidious task;(b) the singling out for benefit of ex-prisoners of war may be resented by other ex-Service personnel andtheir dependants and may also give rise to claims from those captured in e. g. the 1912i-18 war;(e)    an undesirable precedent may be created for givingspecial treatment to prisoners of war in thefuture;(d) political and other difficulties are likely to emerge from any proposal to distribute money otherwise thanon a medical basis;(e) such action by the United Kingdom Government may lead.to pressure on Colonial Governments to use japanese assets in their territories similarly for the benefitof ex-prisoners of war and ex-internees.     This mightbe embarrassing, especially in the case of (i)Colonies with few or no Japanese assets and (ii)Colonies such as Malaya who have already earmarkedtheir share of Japanese assets for other purposese.g. payment of war damage compensation;(f) the scheme would have to exclude United Kingdomresidents who have emigrated to the Colonies or commonwealth if the risk of embarrassment were tobe avoided in the context of the 1945 and 1949 far eastern Chattels Schemes, which apply only to thoseactually resident in the United Kingdom.7. In spite of all these difficulties, however, I considerthat the whole of these assets ought to be used as suggested,I also think that the balance of advantage lies in having themoney distributed through existing charitable organisationsrather than, for instance, through a special officiallyadministered Trust Fundo8. I consider it important that, while organisations which may receive funds from Japanese assets in this country should be given reasonable latitude in carrying out the task,they should bo informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s intention is;(1)    that the money shall be used primarily for the benefitof prisoners of war and civilian internees and their dependants of the 1939-45 war who are resident inthe United Kingdom at the time of payment;(2)    that payments shall be to meet need and hardship and.should preferably not be in the form of continuinggrants;(3)    that the monies should be used for future payments and not to recoup past expenditure;(4)    care must be taken to avoid overlapping with the workof other organisations, and with the payments whichwill bo made by the International Committee of theRed Cross under Article 16 of the Peace Treaty;
(5)    the organisation should not he required to set up aspecial Trust Fund to administer their share of thegrant though this may in certain eases he foundnecessary;(6)    in order that applicants should receive equality oftreatment, the organisation should attempt toestimate the ultimate total of the call likely tobe made on them.9. I accordingly invite my colleagues to agree(a) that the proceeds of the liquidation of Japanese assetin the United Kingdom be used for the benefit of former prisoner of war and civilian internees of the 1939-45 war and their dependants, in the manner described below, notwithstanding thedifficulties set out in paragraph 6 above(b) that the total sum available should be divided into two parts in proportion to the numbers of Service personnel andof civilians who were captured or interned by the Ja^Swe^.Of the Services&apos; share 60 per cent should be distributed, inaccordance with the number of prisoners of war from each service in all theatres of war, between the principal Service charitableorganisations.     After a suitable sum has been allocated to theKing&apos;s Fund, the balance of the remaining 4-0 per cent of theServices&apos;  share plus the whole civilian share should be dis-tributed, after consultation with the Consultative Committee of voluntary Services Associations, to organisations caring for members of all three Services and their dependants and for civilians and their dependants who suffered during the war;(c) that the organisations which receive funds under thisscheme should ho informed of the conditions of grant mentionedin paragraph 8 above:(d) that it should be made clear that the proceeds of the liquidation of Japanese assets in Colonial territories are atthe absolute disposal of the Secretary of State for the Coloniesfor the benefit of, and in consultation with, the Colonia.lterritories concerned..I also invite my colleagues to approve the annexedstatement on this subject which I intend to include in my speech on the draft Japanese Peace Treaty in the forthcoming ForeignAffairs Debate0Ho McForeign Office, S. f. 1,19TH JULY, 1951.
ANNEXIn addition, the draft Treaty gives each of the Alliesthe   right to seise all Japanese assets within its territorysubject to certain exceptions.     In the United Kingdom thetotal net value of these assets is estimated at about 1,250,000;    but, owing to the delays inevitable in the liquidation of certain Japanese companies,  it is probablethat rather less than  900,000 will be available for distribution within six months of the corning into force ofthe Treaty.It has been suggested that the proceeds of the liquidation of these assets should be used as has alreadybeen done in the case of German and Japanese assets in theUnited States, for the payment of allowances to formerprisoners-of-war and civilian internees as compensation fortheir sufferings while in Japanese hands.      But it is clearthat the small total sum available would permit thedistribution of only very small allowances to the manyclaimants in this country.     For this reason, as myRight Honourable Friend the Minister of State said in thecourse of a debate on this subject on the 10th May, HisMajesty&apos;:s Government have been considering whether thevalue of these assets might be used for the endowment orotherwise for the benefit of organisations and institutionswhose work has been and can be of value in helping those inthe United Kingdom   who have suffered, and the dependants inthe united Kingdom of those who died, as a result ofcaptivity or internment in enemy hands during the War.On further consideration however His Majesty&apos;sGovernment believe that it would be right to try to arrangefor the sum available to be distributed in such a way thatformer prisoners-of-war and civilian internees who are in need or undergoing hardship should derive the maximum benefitpossible.      We therefore propose that the money which may beobtained from the liquidation of Japanese assets in theUnited Kingdom should be handed over to selected charitableorganisations closely linked with the Services, or concernedwith the interests of civilian internees for them to distribute in such ways as they think best.      distribution would however be on the understanding that the money shall beused primarily for the benefit of prisoners-of-war and civilian internees of the last War and of their dependants,who must be resident in the United Kingdom at the time of payment;    that it is to meet need and hardship (on a broadinterpretation of those terms), and preferably not to be inthe form of a continuing grant.     There should also besafeguards against overlapping between the various organi-sations, and between payments made from these funds, and thosewhich may be made by the International Committee of theRed Gross from the proceeds of other Japanese assets.It is therefore proposed that this money should be divided up between the various organisations representing thethree Services and civilian internees in proportion to thenumbers of^each of the Services and of civilians who fellinto Jfrfffiw&amp;a. hands.      Of the total allocated to the three services 60 per cent would be divided up between theRoyal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force, for charitableuse in proportion to the number of prisoners-of-war from
each Service in all theatres of war.      The remaining2+0 per cent, after a suitable sum has been allocated to theKing&apos;s fund, would, after due consultation through machinery which already exists, be divided between other charitableorganisations whose work covers all three Services.      Asimilar arrangement would apply to the sum allocated for civilians.By the draft Treaty, His Majesty&apos;s Government will beempowered to seise also Japanese assets in Colonial, Trustand Protected Territories.      I think the House will agreewith me that it is only right that these assets should be entirely at the disposal of the Secretary of State forthe Colonies for the benefit of the territories withwhich he is concerned.
