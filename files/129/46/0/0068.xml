&apos;    33?[(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)confidential cp.(51) 218 COPY NO. %\23RD JULY, 1951CABINETMIGRATION POLICY:  ASSISTED PASSAGEAGREEMENT WITH AUSTRALIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations in accordance with the decision reached by the Cabinet on 28thJune last (CM.(51) 47th Conclusions, Minute 5), I have had several talks with the Acting High Commissioner for Australia and explained to himour attitude towards the question of renewal of the Assisted PassageAgreement with Australia.2. Mr. McCarthy emphasised that his Government were very anxious to renew the Agreement; as much for political as for financial reasons.     His principal points were:-(a) There was general agreement in Australia, irrespective of party, that it was vital tc national security that the population shouldbe increased as quickly as possible;  that the only way of achieving this was by extensive State-aided immigration;  and that immigrantsshould contain a substantial proportion of United Kingdom people,so that Australia&apos;s population should remain predominantly British.It was important that the United Kingdom Government should be known to support this policy, and the best way of demonstratingtheir support was by a financial contribution.    The withdrawal ofthe present small financial contribution would inevitably be con-strued in both countries, whatever might be publicly stated, as meaning that the United Kingdom Government were no longer infavour of emigration.    This would lead to political repercussionsthat would be strong in Australia at least and could only be embarrassing to both Governments.(b) Mr. McCarthy said that the withdrawal of our contribution of 25 per passage and the increase by that amount of the  10 atpresent paid by migrants for a passage, would considerably reducethe flow of migrants.    In particular many families would be unableto afford the increased passage fare.(c) While recognising that the Assisted Migration Scheme was primarily in the interest of Australia, Mr. McCarthy suggestedthat the United   ,-ingdom derived some benefits in return for their expenditure of a little under  1 million a year.    He claimed inparticular that the migrant ships chartered from the Ministry ofTransport, to which the Australian Governments contribution wasabout five times that of the United Kingdom, provided us with a valuable strategic reserve which, as experience had shown, couldbe used for trooping purposes when necessary.    The Ministry ofTransport confirm this.
(J)     Mr. McCarthy also suggested that a further advantage that wederived from participation in the scheme was the right to exercise a certain amount of control over the activities of the Australianimmigration authorities in this country in the interests of our man-power in short-handed industries.    I therefore took the opportunityto point out that, whether the Agreement was or was not renewed,we should certainly expect that the Australian authorities would continue to consult us in such matters, and that it was as much totheir interests as to our own to avoid the public friction,Parliamentary Questions, and general ill-will which would result from the recruitment of worlers in short supply here.Mr. McCarthy did not dissent.(e) Referring to the suggestion made to me by Mr. Men..ies lastJanuary (C,P,(51) 27 of 22nd January, 1951), that &quot;he would like usto keep up our contributions and find some way by which Australiacould pay us back an equivalent amount&quot;,  Mr. McCarthy said that hethought it might be possible, by adjustments of the payments made bythe Australian Government to the Ministry of Transport for themigrant ships, to increase the Australian contribution towards thecost of the ships by  100,000 per annum, which could be regardedas an offset against our contribution to assisted passages.    he undertook to consult his Government on the details of this proposal and to let us know their views.(f) Mr. McCarthy further indicated that, should we desire to limitour financial liabilities under this scheme, the least objectionablemanner from Australia&apos;s point of view would be for us to place a ceiling on our expenditure, rather than to discriminate between different sorts of migrants.3. I told Mr. McCarthy that I would inform my colleagues of his   -representations and let him know our decision as soon as possible.4. It is clear that the Australians attach great importance to the renewal of the Agreement, and that its discontinuance would give riseto a considerable outcry in Australia and to criticism in this country which the Australians might try to work up.    But Mr. Mensies has justannounced that steps may have to be taken to re-examine Australia&apos;simmigration programmes as part of the Australian Governmentscampaign against inflation and it has been suggested that the flow ofmigrants may be reduced by 25 per cent.     In that event the strength ofthe case against the non-renewal of the Assisted Passage agreement would clearly lose much of its force.    It is also clear that they are less concerned with the amount than with the principle of a financial contri-bution from us and I think they would not protest very strongly if welimited our liabilities by imposing a ceiling on our expenditure andsecuring a counter-payment by the Australians (see (e) and (f) ofparagraph 2 above).    On the other hand, renewal would mean that wewere committed to:-(a) the distasteful anachronism of paying our people toemigrate,(b) renewing the Empire Settlement Acts, and(c) extending similar assistance to any other commonwealth countries that cared to apply for it.
It is true that at present Australia is the only Commonwealth country that is asking for financial assistance towards migration;  but as all theother white Commonwealth countries, except South Africa, are very anxious to secure United Kingdom migrants the possibility of furtherapplications cannot be ruled out.5. To sum up, the alternatives before us are:-(a) to refuse to renew the Agreement and to face the resultingpolitical repercussions;(b) to offer to renew the Agreement for, say, three years from30th March last (when the previous term expired), subject to a ceiling of, say,  250,000 on our annual expenditure under theAgreement, less the counter-payment of  100,000 per annumreferred to in paragraph 2(f) if this proves to be practicable.This would not be liked by the Australians, since it would mean anet contribution on our part of only  150,000 compared with an actual contribution last year of about  900,000 and a maximumliability of  1,500,000 under the Empire Settlement Acts.    Itwould involve the renewal of the Empire Settlement Acts andcommitting ourselves to the extension of similar assistance toany other Commonwealth countries that apply for it.6. I recommend that we should adopt alternative (b) on the under-standing that it is made clear to the Australians that this extension isfinal and that thereafter no further financial assistance from us will be forthcoming.    The extension would be conditional on the continuation ofthe existing control of the Australian immigration authorities by theMinistry of Labour, both during the currency of the extended agreement and thereafter.    As a corollary I also recommend that it shouldbe publicly announced that the Empire Settlement Acts will be extended for a further and final period of two years after their expiry on 31st Maynext, and that thereafter they will be allowed to lapse.     Finally Ipropose that I should be authorised to inform other commonwealth governments, e.g. the Canadian Government, which recruit emigrantsfrom this country, that in future we shall expect the activities of theirimmigration authorities here to be subject to the same system of control by the Ministry of Labour as that which exists in the case of the australians.P.C.G.W.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1,23RD JULY, 1951.
