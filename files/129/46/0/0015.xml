THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY   OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the &quot;Cabinet. June 1951 iSECRETISth June, 1951CABINETOWNERSHIP OF GERMAN COAL, IRON AND STEEL industries memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign &quot;affairs my colleagues will. recollect that on 22nd March, they considered amemorandum (C.P. (51) 81) on the attitude which the United Kingdom High Com-missioner Sri Germany should adopt towards/a proposal to allow the transfer to private owners of shares in one of the new steel companies formed under the allied high Commission Law No. 27 for the reorganisation of the German coal^ ironand steel industries. ,. /. &apos;:2. My colleagues then approved the suggestion that, when this matter came before the Allied High Commission, the United kingdom high commissioner should take the lirie that Law 27 obliged the Federal Government to take a generaldecision on the ownership of these industf ies -before any shares in the new companiespassed from the hands of trustees and Were sold in the market. They also agreedthat if the United Kingdom High Commissioner were unable to carry the point heshould appeal to Governments, 2nd that we should then try to persuade the UnitedStates and French Governments that the whole matter was bne for decision by theGerman Government and Parliament (CM. (51) 22nd Conclusions, Minute 5).3. The appropriate instructions Were given to the United Kingdom High Com-missioner. When the matter came before the Council of the Allied high commission on 12th April, the views put forward by him Were opposed by hisAmerican and French colleagues and the matter was put to a vote. Oh being out-voted, the United Kingdom High Commissioner gave notice of his intention to appeal to the Governments.,.4. An. ^de^Mernoire (of which! a Copy is annexed) w^s then^seht to theAmerican and French Governments. The AhiericdhS have returned a.formal replyin which they state that they have carefully considered the questions raised in burAide-Memoire, in the light of their understanding that the decision in this particular case serves as a precedent for the sale or retention by trustees of shares in each ofthe new companies to be established pursuant to Law 27. In their view, such adistribution of shares will not prejudice the Federal Governments, -decision, as theFederal Republic^ right to nationalise its coal and steel industries is not affected.They claim that, as the Federal Chancellor has no intention of bringing the general question of ownership before the Federal Parliament in the near future, to deferaction on the decision in the Hahn-Mannesmann case until he does so would post-pone indefinitely the speedy implementation of Law 27, to which the United StatesGovernment attaches importance. They also reject our suggestion that action inthe particular case under consideration be postponed until the Federal Governmenthas asked the Federal Parliament for its opinion, whether this action would prejudicea decision on the ownership question; this is in the American view a matter for theAllied High Commission to decide, on its own responsibility.5.   So far no formal reply from the French Government has been received, butthe French have informed us that there is no question of their changing their atti-tude. We expect to receive a reasoned reply to our Aide-Memoire in due course.40749Copy No. ^ i
6. Implementation of the Allied High Commission^ majority decision of12th April was suspended for 30 days because of the United Kingdom HighCommissioner^ appeal. This period has now long since expired and, as there is no agreement between two of the Governments concerned to a further period of suspension, the majority decision has taken effect and the appropriate organisationsin Germany have been asked to implement it. This decision involves (a) approval of the Hahn-Mannesmann restitution agreement and the immedi-ate distribution to the Hahn group of the shares in the new company which has been formed from the Mannesmann assets, and(b) the acceptance of the principle that, as soon as the new unit companies are set up under the plans for the reorganisation of the German coal andsteel industries, shares will be distributed to stockholders who are notdisqualified under the provisions of Law 27.7. The attitude which the American and French Governments have taken onthis important issue is unfortunate but by no means unexpected. We have knownfor some time what their views were, have realised that the Hahn-Mannesmannagreement would prove a test case, and have done our utmost to ensure that theFederal Parliament should be able to express its opinion on a matter which in ourview concerns it closely. The German Chancellor and the Social Democraticleader, Dr. Schumacher, have been left in no doubt as to our attitude. When LordHenderson visited Germany in March 1951, he discussed this whole question withleaders of the German Trade Union movement, and they then indicated that theirviews coincided with ours. Lord Henderson told them that a crucial stage had beenreached and that, if they wished to bring their influence to bear on the federal government, they should lose no time in doing so. As I learned during my recent visit to Germany, the Trade Union leaders in fact failed to take timely action. Atthe last moment an effort was made to bring pressure on the Federal Chancellor,by way of a vigorously-worded letter from the Trade Unions and a resolution by theSocial Democratic Party in the Federal Parliament. It was thought that this pressuremight have the result of forcing Dr. Adenauer against his own inclinations to request the Allied High Commission to defer implementing its decision on the Hahn-Mannesmann agreement. The debate on the Social Democratic resolution in theFederal Parliament on 6th June, however, made it clear that no such results couldbe expected. The Federal Government succeeded in getting the vital portions of theresolution referred without debate to a committee and thus effectively placed incold storage.8. In these circumstances, and now that our appeal to Governments has proved unsuccessful, I see no alternative to accepting the majority decision against which we voted. We need, however, have no hesitation in letting it be known inGermany that we were in favour of maintaining the Trusteeship system until theFederal Parliament had made its decision on the general pattern of ownership andof consulting the Federal Parliament on whether the step now taken would prejudicethis decision. If we are criticised in German Social Democratic and Trade Unioncircles, we can point out that it was they who ultimately failed to make their influencefelt at the crucial stage of decision.H. M.Foreign Office, S.W.1,18th June, 1951.
Annex* . 1        1 - &apos; -    -1&apos; ....... .Aide-M^moire to United States and French governments on 12th April the Council of the Allied High Commission in Germany took a decision which in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government involves prejudice to theright of the Federal German Government, as stated in the preamble to Allied high commission Law No. 27, to determine the form bf ownership of the German coal,iron and steel industries. This decision was taken against the opposing vote ofthe United Kingdom High Commissioner in Germany, who gave notice of his intention to appeal. His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to acquaint the United StatesGovernment with their views on this subject, in the hope that, after due considera-tion, the United States Government will issue revised instructions to their HighCommissioner in Germany.2. The decision of the Council of the Allied High Commission was taken inconnection with a restitution agreement between Mannesmann Rohrenwerke (alarge steel combine due for decOncentration under Law 27) and a British firm,Messrs. Hahn Brothers. This agreement applies to two of the constituent companies of the Mannesmann complex which are to become a single &quot; unit company &quot; under allied reorganisation plans: it envisages the transfer of shares in these two cora-panies, in satisfaction of claims by Messrs. Hahn Brothers for restitution, byMannesmann Rohrenwerke to Messrs. Hahn Brothers, who would thus become a majority holder in the new &quot; unit company.&quot; The United States and french high Commissioners held that this transfer should take full effect immediately, andthat the property and shares of the new &quot; unit company &quot; should be immediatelydecontrolled and released by the trustees who now hold them on behalf of the allied high Commission and transferred to the ownership of Messrs. Hahn Brothers.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that, irrespective of the merits of thisindividual case, such a decision is inconsistent with the preamble to Law 27. the relevant passage of the preamble runs as follows&quot; And whereas the Allied High Commission has decided that the questionsof the eventual ownership of the coal and iron and steel industries should bekept to the determination of a representative, freely elected German Govern-ment . . . .&quot;In the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government these words place an obligation onthe Allied Authorities to refrain from any action which might prejudice the ultimatedecision by the Federal Government in the ownership question. The transfer of shares to private owners at the present stage would prejudice the Federal Govern-menfs decision in favour of private ownership, and would thus constitute a breach of the Allied High Commission^ obligations. Further, a precedent would be created for the sale of shares in each &quot;unit company&quot; as it is formed, and theFederal Governments decision would thereby be progressively prejudiced infavour. of private ownership.4. In reaching this conclusion His Majesty&apos;s Government have been inparticular influenced by the following considerations:  (a) The right of the Government of any State to nationalise the property ofits subjects is inherent in the sovereignty of that State; there would beno necessity to reiterate an inherent right in the preamble to Law 27.(b) Law 27 makes full provision for holding the property and shares, not only of the old combines, but also of the new &quot; unit companies &quot; in trustee-ship. These provisions would not have been necessary if the purposesof the law were limited to deconcentrating the old combines and topermitting immediately the transfer or sale&apos; of shares in the newcompanies to private shareholders.(c) The preamble to the Tripartite Law 27 is identical with that to the previousAnglo-American Law on the same subject, Military GovernmentLaw 75. Agreement on the &quot; ownership &quot; formula in the preamble to law 75 was not reached without prolonged discussion and referenceto Governments. His Majesty&apos;s Government believe that at that timetheir own view of the meaning of the preamble was held by the United
States Military Governor, General Clay, who writes in his book&quot; Decision in Germany &quot; (page 329 of the United Kingdom edition):&quot; The enterprises to be formed under the reorganisation must be heldin trusteeship until a freely elected Western German Government hasdetermined the economic pattern of ownership for these industries.&quot;5 His Majesty&apos;s Government are, therefore, of the opinion that the action proposed by the United States arid French High Commissioners is contrary to theletter and spirit of the preamble to Law 27. They understand that the United StatesGovernment fear that.delay in the sale of shares, pending a decision by the federal government on the OAVnersMp question, would jeopardise Allied control over thedistribution of shares in the &quot;unit companies&quot; (assuming that the decision werein favour of private ownership) and would thereby facilitate the resumption ofpositions of control in the German coal, iron and steel industries by supporters of the former National Socialist regime. His Majesty&apos;s Government do hot thinkthese fears need be an insuperable obstacle to the maintenance of the Trusteesystem. It should be possible, in pursuance of the Brussels decisions of the threeForeign Ministers^ to arrive at some contractual arrangement with the federal government whereby the latter would5i if completion of the reorganlsaiioriprogramme is delayed by the lacjc of a decision on ownership beyond the period ofAllied control, assume, responsibility, inter alia, for preventing the return toresponsible positions of former owners and supporters of the National Socialistregime.6. Apart from the interpretation of Law 27, there is, in the opinion of his majesty&apos;s ]&apos;esty&apos;s Government, another important reason for reconsidering the decision ofthe United States and French High Commissioners. In November 1950 theGerman Federal Parliament adopted a resolution calling upon the German federal government to submit proposals for its consideration on the question of ownership of the coal, iron and steel industries, arid requesting the German Government andthe Allied High Commission to do nothing in the course of implementing Law 27which would influence a decision on this question. Though the Federal Govern-ment has not yet submitted such proposals and though a. resolution by the federal parliament on this subject is in no way binding on the Allied High Conimissiori, HisMajesty&apos;s Government consider on broad political grounds that action which is inconsistent with the Federal Parliaments resolution would be highly inappropriatein present circumstances.7. It was for the reasons given in paragraphs 4 and 6 above that the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner in Germany opposed the decision to decontrol theproperty in question. His Majesty&apos;s Government attach great importance to ensuring that action in this matter does not run counter to the resolution passed bythe German Federal Parliament on the subject of ownership. They therefore consider it essential that, before any further action is taken by way of decontrollingthe property of the two companies in question, the Federal Government should beasked to consult the Federal Parliament as to whether such decontrol would consti-tute prejudice to the ownership issue under the terms of its resolution of November1950. His Majesty&apos;s Government assure the United States Government, that theywould be prepared to abide by whatever answer is given by the Federal Parliamentto this question, if the United States and French Governments would agree to takethe same attitude. His Majesty&apos;s Government hope that the United States Govern-ment will now review this whole matter in the light of this proposal and will sendrevised instructions to their High Commissioner in Germany.8. His Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome an early expression of the viewsof the United States Government on this question.British Embassy, Washington,9th May, 1951.
