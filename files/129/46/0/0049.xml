-    235THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY  OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1951CONFIDENTIAL &apos; Copy No. 31CP. (51) 199UthJuly, 1951&apos; cabinet&quot;&quot;&apos;JUDGES&apos; SALARIES AND EXPENSESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerThere have for some time past been representations, in Parliament and else-where, that the salaries of Judges, particularly in the County Court, should beincreased. The salaries of most Judges are fixed by statute and legislation wouldbe required to alter them.2. In my view we ought not to increase the salaries of the High Court Judges.In England these salaries are at the least  5,000 a year. Present rates of taxationwould make small increases at this salary level of little effective value and any increases to those with incomes of this amount involve obvious political difficulties.Different considerations apply in Scotland and I refer to these later. My conclusion is that High Court salaries should be left unchanged. The Lord Chancellor acceptsthis conclusion.3. The Lord Chancellor feels, however, that some increase must be given tothe County Court Judges who at present get  2,000 in that capacity plus varyingamounts (averaging  330 a year) where they act as Divorce Commissioners.4. This question and that of judicial expense allowances have been examined in detail by officials of the Home Office, Lord Chancellor^ Department, scottish home Department and Treasury, who were instructed-(i) To consider the case for an increase in the salaries of County court judges both as regards merits and possible repercussions, on the definiteunderstanding that there should be no question of any increase in the salaries of High Court Judges.(ii) To examine the question of expense allowances for Judges generally.5. The working party&apos;s report (of which a copy is attached as an annex tothis paper) has formed the basis of discussion between the Lord Chancellor, theHome Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Lord Advocate and myself.6. Judicial expenses.-We are all agreed that the recommendations onexpenses (paragraph 29 of the Report) should be adopted, viz:  (a) No additional benefit should be given to any English Judges, except thatofficial transport should be provided for High Court Judges onceremonial occasions in London when they have to attend fully robed.(b) High Court Judges in Scotland should be allowed, a reasonable scale of expenses when they go on Circuit. Before 1887 such allowances were paid but were terminated by the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act ofthat year in view of the increased salaries authorised under that Actin compensation for the abolition of those allowances. Expenditureon Circuit in present conditions presses more hardly On the ScottishJudges than in former years and J consider that a reasonable allowancesuch as is paid to members of Royal Commissions would be justified.The Scottish Judges are not involved in the same degree of ceremonialand hospitality as the English and there would be no case for&apos; giving them the customary English allowances.40893 B
(c) There should be a wider extension of the system 6f travelling allowances for Sheriffs Substitute in Scotland. The County Court Judges inEngland get such allowances, as do four of the Sheriffs Substitute inScotland and it would be only reasonable to allow any further SheriffsSubstitute, for whom a case can be made out on merits, to enjoy the- - same arrangement.(d) The Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland should be given the sameCircuit allowance as the other Northern Ireland Judges. The lord chief Justice is barred from such allowances under a statutory arrange-ment which was made when he did not go on Circuit. Now that hegoes on Circuit he should be treated like the other Supreme court judges in Northern Ireland.(b) and id) would involve legislation. My colleagues will note from paragraph 29 (c) of the Official Report that legislation on (b) may be theoccasion for critics in,our own party to suggest that the existing English circuitallowances are excessive.7. Salaries of County Court Judges, &amp;c.-The Lord Chancellor and I agree in recommending the following improvements in the salaries of County court judges and of the Metropolitan magistrates whose salaries must be kept in line with County Court salaries,(a) The salary of County Court Judges should be  2,750 on appointment,rising to  3,000 after five years&apos; service, These salaries wouldcompound the existing fees payable for divorce work. These atpresent average  330, so that the actual increase in emoluments Wouldbe some  420, rising to  670.ih) The salary of Metropolitan Magistrates should be  2,500 on appointment,rising to  2,750 after five years&apos; service. The Chief MetropolitanMagistrate should have  2,750 for any balance of the five years to be served as a Metropolitan Magistrate and  3,000 thereafter,8.  The main arguments for these increases are as follows:  (a) The Lord Chancellor asserts that he is finding it increasingly difficult to attract suitable candidates from the Bar for the present emoluments,(b) There has been no increase for County Court Judges, apart from whatthey earn as Divorce Commissioners since 1937,(c) Salaries have recently been increased at this level in the Civil Service.Indeed, a further reason for the proposed increases is that certainCounty Court officials get the same salary as the Judge.9. Sheriffs, and Sheriffs Substitute, &amp;c, in Scotland.-These officers inScotland correspond broadly with the County Court Judges in England and,though some of them have had increases since 1937, I woulci agree that their salaries and that of the Chairman of the Land Court should at least move upin line with what is proposed for the County Court Judges. They do not do divorcework and they would therefore receive pdri passu increases if they were giventhe net increases of  420, rising to  670, proposed for the County Court Judges.I would be willing to round these increases to  450 and  700, which would produce the following results:-^Present salary    Revised salaryInitially   After 5 years Sheriff of Lanark      ...     ......     2,400Sheriff of the Lothians and Peebles ...     2,200Sheriff Substitute A   ...     ......     1,900Sheriff Substitute B    ..........1,700Sheriff Substitute C    .........     1,400Chairman Scottish Land Court      ...     2,200This improvement of the above salaries would not require legislation.10. Northern Ireland Puisne Judges, The Lord Chancellor considers thatit is anomalous that in Northern Ireland the Puisne Judges should have a smallersalary than the Appeal Judges,-whereas, both in England and Scotland, salaries of 	 2,850	3,1002,650	%m2,350	2.6002,150	2.4001,850	2,1002,650	2,900
Puisne Judges and Appeal Judges are the same. I should be willing for the PuisneJudges&apos; salary to be increased from its present  3,000 to the  3,500 paid to the appeal Judges. Legislation would be required and I think I should point outthat the fact thatjve are prepared to alter, High Court salaries in Northern Irelandsomewhat weakens our stand in refusing to touch High Court salaries in Englandand Scotland. But we can, of course, argue that to increase a salary of  3,000is different from increasing salaries of  3,600,  5,000 and  6,000.11. The case for equalising- Scottish arid English judicial salaries. TheSecretary of State for Scotland and the Lord Advocate do not accept my proposalsfor the Scottish judiciary. They claim that the traditional differentials should be abandoned and that Scottish Judges at all levels should be paid the same as theirEnglish counterparts,12. Sheriffs Substitute. My proposals in paragraph&quot;9 increase the salaries of the Sheriffs Substitute whilst preserving the existing differential (though slightlyreducing it). The Secretary of State wishes to abolish the differential entirely sofar at least as Sheriffs Substitute A and B are concerned.13.  I, must oppose this proposal for three reasons:  (a) The judicial systems in the two countries are not alike and there is ho &quot;such- correspondence between the work of the Sheriffs Substitute and county court Judges that their responsibilities can be shown to be in all respectsL equal. They are undoubtedly different, and this. difference has formany years been marked by lower salaries but proportionately higherretiring pensions in Scotland. I do not see why this long-standingarrangement should now be disturbed.(b) The fact, moreover, is that judicial salaries in England and Scotland have always been fixed at a level sufficient to attract suitable candidates from:      private practice.  Earnings from private practice in Scotland have; always been and remain lower than in England and for that reasonalone a lower salary for the Bench has been sufficient in Scotland,-    (t) To grant parity with England would involve paying the Sheriff of Lanark;the most highly paid Sheriff,  3,500 a year, &amp; this were done there&apos;. would be no hope of keeping the Scottish. High Court Judges at their&apos;v?-?i existing  3,600 since the differential would bedenipnstrabiy. too small,And if we started raising Scottish High Court salaries we should find it hard to stop at any point in their hierarchy and this would necessitategiving an increase to the Lord President who is now paid  5,000. Todp this would completely invalidate our proposition that it is indecentto contemplate an increase for the English High Court judges in viewof the size of their existing salary of  5,000.14, Scottish High Court.- The Secretary of State for Scotland and Jhe lord advocate also ask for the salaries of the Scottish High Court to be brought into line with those of the English High Court judges. I must oppose this for the samereasons as I have given in paragraph 1.3 in connection with the similar claim forthe Sheriffs Substitute.Summary of Recommendations15.   I recommend (a) that the changes in expense allowance arrangements set out in paragraph 6should be approved;(b) that the salaries of County Court Judges, Metropolitan magistrates,Sheriffs and Sheriffs Substitute and of the Chairman of the. ScottishLand Court should be increased as proposed in paragraphs 7 and 9;(c) that the salaries of the Puisne Judges in Northern Ireland should beincreased as proposed in paragraph 10;(d) that no attempt should be made to introduce the new principle of paritybetween English and Scottish judicial salaries,H. Q.Treasury Chambers, S.W, 1,9th July, 1951.
:;.     -      * &apos; ANNEX ,SALARIES OF COUNTY COURT JUDGESEXPENSE ALLOWANCES OF HIGH COURT ANDOTHER JUDGES&apos; 1. This Memorandum is the result of discussions between the Home Office,the Lord Chancellor^ Department, the Scottish Home Department and theTreasury.  We were instructed (1) to consider the case for an increase in the salaries of County Court Judgesboth as regards merits and possible repercussions, on the definite under-standing that there could be nO question of any increase in the salaries of High Court Judges;     , \(2) to examine the question of expense allowances for Judges generally. -The views expressed below are our views as officials, and in no way commit theMinisters in charge of our Departments.I.-INCREASED SALARIES FOR COUNTY COURT JUDGES2. Existing Salaries-There axe 61 County Court Judges at the present timeand their existing salary (last fixed in 1937) is  2,000. In addition, however, county court Judges have in recent years been receiving fees for acting as Divorce Com-missioners, which is outside the scope of their County Court duties. These feesvary from circuit to circuit. One County Court Judge in the last year received 1,171. Another received as little as  50. The average of fees in London was  226and over the country as a whole  330. It might, therefore, be taken that the roughaverage earnings of a County Court Judge for divorce work is some  300 (thoughthe average covers wide disparities).The Case on Merits for an Increase3. The Case for an Increase on General Grounds. It may fairly be said that nearly all professional men earning  2,000 in 1937 have had an increase since thatdate. This increase has been justified partly by the greatly increased cost of living and partly by the need to keep pace with the increased earnings of persons on similar salary levels in non-professional occupations. The rising cost of livingbears no less hard on County Court Judges than on others with similar incomes, andone of the grounds on which they began pressing for an increase of salary five yearsago was that some of their number had already been reduced to great financialstraits. It has to be borne in mind that Judges are not able to supplement their salaries in any way. They are debarred by statute from practising at the bar oracting as arbitrators for remuneration, and they are expected to maintain a standardof conduct which in effect precludes them from indulging in any profitable side line.4. The Inadequacy of the Present Salaries to Secure Replacements. TheLord Chancellor&apos;^ Department claim that the existing salaries are making it difficult for them to find barristers of adequate qualifications to take appointments as-County Court Judges. While all vacancies have been filled and the adequacy ofthe qualifications of the candidates is a matter of judgment, the Lord ChancellorsDepartment are of opinion that in making recent appointments the Lord chancellor has not had an adequate field to choose from.5. Relativities with Court Officers-There are a number of judicial officials(e.g., Registrars) who are regarded as civil servants and, as such, have, therefore,had their salaries recently increased as a result of the acceptance of the ChorleyCommittee&apos;s proposals. The effect as regards County Court Registrars is that oneof these subordinate officials now has a higher salary than his Judge, 25 have thesame salary and 12 are on a scale rising to the same figure.
-General conclusion. It seems to us that the arguments set out in the foregoing paragraphs showthat an increase in the salaries of County Court Judges is justified on merits. Itis less clear how much that increase ought to be. The Departments concernedpoint out that judges hold a unique position in the: Constitution Which distinguishesthem from other servants of the Crown and from persons holding appointments inother professions. The level of salaries in other fields may properly be looked at tosee whether judicial salaries are now too low, but the question how high a judicialsalary ought to be depends on considerations which do not apply in other fields.Judges are essential for carrying out the laws Parliament enacts. Parliament has,therefore, a vital interest in the Judges being of high quality in themselves and beingrespected by the public, at large, and a lowering of the judicial standard would endanger respect for the law and consequently for Parliament.Alternative Proposals for Increase of Salaries7. We have considered two alternative revised salaries for the County court judges (a)  3,000;(b)  2,750.Under either alternative we recommend that in consideration of the increase in salary the County Court Judges should do their divorce work without extraremuneration. In effect, therefore, the above proposals would give the county court Judges a net increase in remuneration (on the basis of an average earning of 300 for divorce work) of  700 and  450 respectively. We do not consider thatany increase of less than  450 would be adequate. Departments other than theTreasury do not consider that any increase of less than  700 would be adequate,8. We have considered two propositions which are alternatives to a straightincrease in salaries and which it would be possible to regard as a reorganisation of the system of remuneration for the County Court Judges even though, as aresult, the Judges would, in fact, get better pay. The two propositions are (a) that the County Court Judges should be put on a scale instead of a fixedsalary, the minimum of which might be rather less and the maximumrather more than the fixed salaries suggested above;(b) that the County Court Judgeships should be graded in the same way as the posts of Sheriff Substitute in Scotland.We examine these two propositions in turn.9. The substitution of a scale for fixed remuneration. Three objectionshave been raised against this suggestion-(a) In other Crown Services fixed rates rather than scales are the usual methodof remuneration at the more senior levels.(b) An incremental scale is justified on the ground that with growing experiencea Crown Servant is worth more, than when he first entered the grade.This argument cannot easily be used in the case of judicial appoint-ments since, in theory at any rate, it implies that the Judge, whenappointed, administers something less than justice while he is climbingup the scale and acquiring experience.(b) The Lord Chancellor^ Department have argued that any such arrange-&quot; ment would effectively narrow the field of recruitment. The experiencedbarrister between the age of 45 and 55 might be willing to give up his practice at the bar and accept a post at a fixed salary of  x but might be unwilling if the immediate salary were less even though, byserving for a number of years, a higher salary would be attained.10. The second proposition is that Judgeships should be graded accordingto the comparative importance of the circuit. It is felt that such an arrangement would be open to objection on the ground that it would introduce something likepatronage in the promotion of the County Court Judge. Admittedly, underthe present system the Executive has the delicate task of choosing which county court Judges, if any, are to be promoted to the High Court, which from the
High Court to the Court of Appeal, and which to the House of Lords. But withthe field of promotion confined to its present dimensions, the Lord Chancellor,who is as much a Judge as. ah Executive Minister, is able to handle this problempersonally. Any extension of the ;field to cover promotions from one county court circuit to another in the case; of more than 60 County Court Judges wouldgive ground for suspicion that a County Court Judge&apos;s future depended on theadvice given by civil servants. Admittedly the 47 posts of Sheriff Substitute inScotland are graded, so that in Scotland these difficulties have, been overcome,but the Lord Advocate has enough first-hand knowledge of the Sheriffs Substituteto deal with the promotions himself, whereas the Lord Chancellor would in facthave to rely on the advice of his Department. A further argument against gradingin England is that though the provincial Judge may have less continuous judgingand more travelling than the urban Judge, both as Judge and as Chairman orDeputy Chairman of Quarter Sessions, he is a more prominent figure in the county and needs at least as high a salary as the urban Judge.Repercussions11. Repercussions on the Higher Civil Service, particularly Registrars. Judicial officers such as Registrars on the  2,000 level, have had their salariesraised by  500 to  2,500. They could have no grievance if the County Court Judge&apos;ssalary was raised by  450. The alternative increase of  700 might create a prima facie ground for grievance, but the Lord Chancellor would not regard any suchgrievance as justified. As regards non-judicial civil servants we do not fear anyrepercussions under either proposal. &apos;\: 12. Repercussions on-&apos;Metropolitan.Magistmtes-M&amp;ttopolit&amp;n- Magistrateshave had the same remuneration as County Court Judges for the last SO years andthey claim that their salaries should increase automatically to the same level as any improved salary which may now be proposed for the County Court Judges onthis occasion. But there is an argument why the Metropolitan Magistrates ought,on this occasion, to be content with a lower salary. Metropolitan Magistrates^although they also have a difficult matrimonial jurisdiction and are eligible to beappointed as Divorce Commissioners, have in practice done no divorce work andhave received no fees on that account. For some time past, therefore, they havebeen receiving on average  300 less than the County Court Judges. It is, therefore,reasonable to suggest that their salaries should now proceed to something like 300 less than the new County Court salary which compounds the County court judge&apos;s earnings for divorce work. We suggest, therefore, that the metropolitan magistrates should proceed to  2,750 if the higher salary of  3,000 is adopted forCounty Court Judges. The Treasury suggest that, if County Court Judges receive 2,750, Metropolitan Magistrates should receive no more than  2,500. The HomeOffice and the Lord Chancellors Department, however, maintain that nothing lessthan  2,750 will suffice for obtaining barristers of adequate qualifications forMetropolitan Magistrates. If, therefore, the lower salary of  2,750 is adpoted forCounty Court Judges, they consider that Metropolitan Magistrates should havethe same.13. Repercussions on the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate.-^-The Chief Metro-politan Magistrate has a traditional lead of  300 over the ordinary metropolitan magistrates. We suggest that something like this lead would have to be preservedby raising the pay to  3,000 or  2,750 according to whether the salary of theordinary Magistrate became  2,750 or  2,500.14.^ Repercussions on other Stipendiary Magistrates, Chairmen of quarter sessions &amp;c. All these salaries are paid out of local funds. The salaries of provincial Stipendiary Magistrates vary but may not exceed the salary payable toan ordinary Metropolitan Magistrate. They would no doubt have to be adjusted to take account of any increases given to the Metropolitan Magistrates. TheChairman of the London Quarter Sessions has a lead of  500 over metropolitan magistrates, and we consider, that this would have to be maintained. The deputy chairman has the same, salary as a Metropolitan Magistrate ,and should continueto do so. An all-round increase in the salaries of full-time Magistrates wouldprobably produce a movement to increase the part-time.ad hoc salaries of paidRecorders and- Chairmen ..and Deputy Chairmen of Quarter Sessions outside london. &quot;&apos; &quot;
15. Repercussions on Judicial[\ Officersin 5corfan^.-It is inevitable that theSheriffs and Sheriffs Substitute should get some salary increase; and we are agreedthat the minimum increase which could be defended is one of approximately theiSame amount as the average net increase proposed for the English County court judges, i.e.,  700 under alternative (a) and  450 under alternative (b). The scottish office point out however that in order to produce round figures the increases .contemplated for the Metropolitan Magistrates (who it is suggested should alsomove in step with the net increase for County Court Judges) have been put atslightly larger figures viz.  750 and  500. The following table shows the effect which increases of  700 and  450 would have on the salaries of the Sheriffs andSheriffs Substitute and on the salary of the Chairman of the Scottish Land Courtwho comes in the same salary band. The table shows also the extent to which such increases would reduce the gap between the remuneration of these officersand that of the Judges of- the High Court and Court of Session:  ;(1) The full-time Sheriffs and Sheriffs-Substitute	Salary	SalaryExisting	related to	related toSalary	Proposal (a)	Proposal ib).              -.. -:     &apos;    &quot;    -            		Sheriff of Lanark     ...     ...     2,400	3,100	2,850Sheriff of the Lothians and		Peebles..........     2,200	2,900	- 2,6508 Sheriffs Substitute A      ...      1,900	2,600	2,35022 Sheriffs Substitute B      ...      1,700	2,400	2,15017 Sheriffs Substitute C      ...     1,400	2,100	1,850(2) The Chairman of the Scottish Land Court			Salary	SalaryExisting	related to	related toSalary	Proposal (a)	Proposal (b).                     	 	 2,200	2,900	.    2,650(3) The High Court of Justiciary and Court of SessionExisting.

It will, however, be argued on behalf of the Sheriffs Substitute, whoexercise both civil and criminal jurisdiction, that their salaries ought to be increasedby an amount which would give them broadly speaking parity with the county court Judges. It is true that the Sheriffs Substitute have no divorce jurisdiction,but they have a much wider civil jurisdiction than the County Court Judges, theypreside over the principal criminal courts in Scotland and they also have certain administrative duties. The Scottish Office consider that these circumstances justifythe payment, at least to the Sheriffs Substitute in Category A, of a salary not lessthan the inclusive salary, whether  3,000 or  2,750, now suggested for the county court Judges, and of corresponding increases in the other categories. The HomeOffice and Lord Chancellors Department hold, however, that, if the SheriffsSubstitute A were equated in salary with the County Court Judges, the same rateof pay should be given to the Metropolitan Magistrates who at present receive 100 a year more than the Sheriffs Substitute. The Treasury consider that, in theabsence of any new factor (other than the divorce work of the County court judges) affecting the existing relationships, the salaries of the Sheriffs Substituteand Metropolitan Magistrates should not be increased beyond the figures suggestedin paragraphs 15 and 12 respectively.
17. The Chairman of the Scottish Land Court has under statute the Status ofa High Court Judge. His present salary is the Same as that of the Sheriff of theLothians and Peebles and presumably that position should be maintained. But itwill be argued on his behalf that his present salary is wholly inadequate both tohis status and to his responsibilities, and that, it should be at least as great as, ifhot greater than, the salary of a High Court Judge; and it will be claimed that ifany adjustments are taking place the opportunity should be taken to correct thepresent alleged maladjustment.18. The Judges of the High Court and the Court of Session exercise, like theSheriffs, both criminal and civil jurisdiction. It will be argued on their behalf thatthe range and burden of their responsibilities are at least as great as those of the judges of the High Court in England and that accordingly they should beremunerated at the same rate. If this were conceded they would receive (except inthe cases of the Lord Justice-General and Lord President of the Court of session and of the Lord Justice-Clerk) the salary of  5,000 paid to the Puisne Judges inEngland; and the existing lead of the two Heads of Court would have to be main-tained. The argument in support of this course would be reinforced by the factthat, if nothing is done for the High Court, the increases given to the Sheriffs andSheriffs Substitute will narrow to an embarrassing extent the gap between their salaries and those of the Judges. The greater the increases given to the Sheriffsand Sheriffs Substitute, the narrower, of course, the gap will become.19. It is therefore for consideration whether, as a means of maintainingsomething like the existing gap between the salaries of the Judges and the salaries of the Sheriffs, the former might be increased from their present figure of  3,600to  4,250: The Departments assume that under their terms of reference they wouldbe precluded from considering any increase for the Lord President and the LordJustice-Clerk and they consider that for the time being the reduction in the gap between the salaries of those two officers and those of the ordinary Judges, if the salary of the latter were increased to  4,250, could be tolerated: The Treasury,however, point out that, as the increase to  4,250 falls short of that for which acase will be argued, but at the same time necessarily raises the question of HighCourt salaries in England and Northern Ireland, it might be better to give no increase-other than by way of expenses (see paragraph 29 (c))-and to defend thispolicy on the ground that the time is not considered opportune for dealing with theHigh Court in either country. They also observe that it would be substantiallyeasier to do this if the increases to the Sheriffs and Sheriffs Substitute were to belimited to the figures set out in paragraph 15, and a fortiori to the lower of the alternatives there suggested.20. The Lord Chancellors Office are not immediately interested in the salaries of Sheriffs and Sheriffs Substitute, but they would view with some appre-hension a decision to leave untouched the salaries of the Scottish High Court, if adecision to do this were allowed to influence the decision on the new salary of a county Court Judge in favour of the lower of the two rates suggested. Nor dothey claim to be concerned with the question how the salaries of Sheriffs andSheriffs Substitute ought to be.adjusted in relation to other salaries in Scotland(paragraph 15 (1)), but they maintain that County Court Judges ought to have 3,000 even if for any reason it should be thought desirable to leave the salaries ofthe Scottish High Court untouched.21. Repercussions on the Judiciary in Northern Ireland. In NorthernIreland the United Kingdom Government is responsible for the salaries of HighCourt Judges and the Northern Ireland Government for those of County court judges. The Lord Chief Justice has a salary of  4,500, the two Lord Justices ofAppeal  3,500, and the two Puisne Judges  3,000. These salaries were fixed in1926. Of the five County Court Judges one (the Recorder of Belfast) is paid  2,500,the rest  2,000. These salaries were fixed in 1947, giving increases of  500 to theRecorder of Belfast and  350 or  250 to the others. There can be little Case for anyfurther increase in County Court salaries at the present time, and if the NorthernIreland Government felt obliged to concede something it would presumably bemuch less than is given to English County Court Judges, more especially as the IrishJudges do not do divorce work.22. If the Northern Ireland Government felt obliged to give some increase totheir County Court Judges and if it were also decided to increase the salaries of the lords Ordinary in Scotland on the ground that this was necessary to preserve an
adequate gap between their remuneration and that of; the Sheriffs-Substitute wecould not very well avoid similar increases for the Puisne Judges in NorthernIreland. The gap between their salaries and that, of the Recorder of Belfast at 500 is already unduly small. In such circumstances they should presumably have their salaries increased to  3,500, the rate paid to the Lord. Justices of Appeal,particularly as there is no justification for paying a lower rate to them than to theLord Justices, with whom they are interchangeable. There would be no case for improving the salary of the Lords Justices of Appeal or the Lord Chief Justice.23. The Lord Chancellors Office feel that, whatever increase may be given to county Court Judges, or whether or not any increase is given to the Scottish HighCourt, a case exists on merits for increasing the salary of the Puisne Judges inNorthern Ireland to  3,500. In their view  3,000 is in modern conditions too smalla salary for a Judge of the High Court whose jurisdiction is not inferior to that ofthe Scottish or the English High Court. The Lord Chancellor^ Office and theHome Office recommend that this increase should be made whether or not there isto be any increase for the Irish County Court Judges.24. Conclusions and recommendations on salary increases for the county court Judges and the consequent repercussions.- These are set Out in paragraph 31.II.  EXPENSES25.  Two proposals have been canvassed:  (a) That the English High Court Judges should be given more generous expenseallowances than those to which they are at present entitled and that, inparticular, some form of free transport to and from their residences andthe Law Courts should be provided.(b) That the expense system in operation in England should be extended to scotland.26.  Existing arrangements in England -(a) High Court. In addition to the reimbursement of his own and his clerk&apos;sfares to the assize town, and to free lodging and transport in the assizetown for himself and entourage, the English Judge on circuit is entitledto allowances at a flat rate (i) of  7 10s. a day for subsistence of himself and clerk and subsistence and travel of any servants (e.g., cook andbutler) he may take with him, (ii) of  2 2s. a day for subsistence andtravel of his Marshal, if he takes him. These allowances which, ofcourse, are paid in addition to salary are, as purporting to cover no morethan necessary expenses, not subject to Income Tax and Sur-tax. Inaddition, all Judges are entitled to claim Income Tax and Sur-tax relief for expenditure incurred by them out of taxed income in respect of aroom in their private house used as a study, for the upkeep of a lawlibrary and the upkeep of robes, &amp;c.(b) County Court Judges-On each new appointment a sum is fixed by theLord Chancellors Department as the expense allowance of the Judge inquestion. This varies from circuit to circuit but in each case is assumed to be no more than what the Judge would have been able to claim byway of reimbursement of actual expenditure for travel by train or bycar, for subsistence at hotels where necessary, with 15 per cent, addedfor contingencies. This allowance is paid in addition to salary and is not subject to Income Tax or Sur-tax. County Court Judges, like the HighCourt Judges, are also entitled to claim Income Tax or Sur-tax relief for expenditure out of taxed income under the same heads as are setout above in respect of High Court Judges.27:  Existing arrangements in Scotland(a) High Court.-Although the Scottish Judges also go circuit, they do not getany circuit expenses on the same basis as the English Judges. similar arrangements were originally in force but were expressly terminated inScotland by the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act, 1887, which increased the salaries of the Scottish Judges to compensate them for theloss of these previous allowances for circuit expenses. Allowances onthe English model could only be reintroduced in Scotland if amending
&apos;     .&apos; -&apos; &apos; - legislation were introduced.  The Scottish Judges can, of course, claim. - i ;      Income Tax and Sur-tax relief in respect of expenditure incurred in the. course of their duties.. (b). Sheriffs &apos; Substitute.-*-In general, the Sheriffs Substitute receive ; no allowance for circuit expenses. Four of them, however, who haveexceptionally scattered districts, get a travelling allowance, exempt from Income Tax and Sur-tax, of  100. This allowance is fixed onthe same kind of basis as the allowance for the English County court judges, i.e., as covering by and large no more than the sums whichthey would have been able to claim as having been actually incurred on travel, subsistence, &amp;c. The other Sheriffs Substitute can claim tax relief on their actual expenses. There would be no statutory bar to theextension of the allowance system already in force in respect of thefour Sheriffs Substitute to the other Sheriffs Substitute.28. Existing arrangements in Northern Ireland. -Here we are concerned only with the High Court Judges, each of whom, except the Lord Chief Justice,may be paid an allowance of  150 each time he goes on Circuit. The Lord chief justice gets no Circuit Allowance at all. This statutory restriction is inherited fromthe Supreme Court of Ireland which was established in 1877. There were then a large number of Judges and it was not necessary for the Lord Chief Justice to goon Circuit. In the Supreme Court of Northern Ireland there are only five Judgesincluding the Lord Chief Justice, who has to take his turn with the others ingoing Circuit. ;29.   Proposed amendments in the present system .(a) England&apos;- High Court.- We see no scope for any extension of the allowances to the High Court Judges.* There is no justification for freetransport when this is not available to other high officers of State(except Cabinet Ministers). All we feel able to suggest is that officialtransport might be provided on ceremonial occasions when the Judges-have to attend fully robed at Westminster, the Mansion House, &amp;c.(b) England: County Court Judges-Vtfe do not consider that there is anyneed.to improve the present system, which seems to work reasonably well and has given rise to no serious complaint(c) Scotland: High Court. To provide for the payment of expenses to the judges of the High Court in Scotland would require legislation and itis recommended that a Bill should be introduced to authorise any reason-. able scale of expenses such as that allowed to members of royal commissions. The practice of the Scottish Judge who goes Circuitdiffers greatly from that of the Judge in England, and for Scotland pro-vision does not have to be made for any considerable ceremonial andhospitality. The Scottish grievance about Circuit expenses will un-doubtedly be raised in the House, and whether it is met in the wayproposed or not, reference will be made to the considerably higherCircuit allowances which, by tradition are allowed to English Judges. Itmay even be said-and this may indeed be true that by cutting down the standard of living and hospitality which were formerly customary onCircuit some English Judges manage to save money on the Circuit allow-ances. This risk will have to be run in any event, but it should be easy to postpone any question of reconsidering the English Circuit allowancesat least till the salaries of the English High Court Judges are reviewed.id) Scotland: Sheriffs Substitute-There is a good case on merits for extending to a number of other Sheriffs Substitute the allowances given to the fourSheriffs Substitute who at present enjoy them. No legislation would- be involved.(e) Northern Ireland. The position of the Lord Chief Justice is anomalous inthat he has to pay his Circuit expenses out of his own pocket. Thereis a good case on merits for legislation giving him the same allowances as the other Judges. ,     .* The Lord Chancellors Department, wish to qualify their acceptance of this recommendation.They feel that at a more propitious time it might be desirable to increase the allowances to enablethe High Court. Judge to bridge the gap between the cost of maintaining the style of living whichis expected of him and the income which is left to him after paying tax oh his salary.
3(3. Cost of the Proposals in this Report-The increased-salaries recom-mended for County Court Judges, Sheriffs Substitute and Metropolitan Magistrateswould cost about  100,000 per annum on the basis of  3,000 as the new salary forCounty Court Judges. On the basis of  2,750 for County Court Judges the1 cost would be some  65,000 or  72,000 per annum according to whether metropolitan magistrates were given  2,500 or  2,750. An increase^ in the salary of the LordsOrdinary in Scotland to  4,250 and of the two Puisne Judges in Northern ireland to  3,500 would cost some  9,000 per annum. The cost of Our recommendations inregard to expenses cannot be estimated with any precision but should not be great.31.   Summary.of Conclusions and recommendations i. Salaries(a) Salaries of County Court Judges. We are all agreed that an increase is justified. Departments other than the Treasury do not consider that anysalary less than  3,000 would be adequate. The Treasury recommendan increase to  2,750. Under either proposition this increase would be conditional on the surrender of fees for, divorce work which at presentamount to  300 on average. The average net increase would thereforebe  700 or  450 (paragraphs 2 to 10).(b) Salaries of Metropolitan Magistrates. On merits the metropolitan magistrates should be content with a smaller increase since for sometime they have received less total remuneration than the County court judges. If the County Court Judges go to  3,000, they should be content with  2,750, and the Lord Chancellors Office and the HomeOffice would accept this proposal unless the Sheriffs Substitute A were then to be given  3,000, as the Scottish Office propose (see (d) below).In logic if the County Court Judges go to  2,750 the metropolitan magistrates should have  2,500, but the Home Office and LordChancellor^ Department maintain that they could not get adequatecandidates for less than  2,750. The Chief Metropolitan Magistrateshould maintain his lead over the Metropolitan Magistrates (para-graphs .12, 13 and 16).(c) Other Stipendiary Magistrates, &amp;c. Salaries are controlled by localauthorities. No doubt they would feel obliged to give increases in line with those envisaged under (a) and (b). (Paragraph 14.)(d) Sheriffs and Sheriffs Substitute in Scotland. Increased salaries would follow inevitably on any increase given to the County Court Judges.Since no divorce work is done by the Sheriffs there is a case for smallerincreases than those proposed for the County Court Judges. Theminimum increase is one of approximately  700 or  450, corresponding to the net increase for County Court Judges under our alternative pro-posals. The Treasury see no grounds for going beyond this minimum.The Scottish Office consider that the salaries of Sheriffs Substitute should be increased to the same level, whether  3,000 or  2,750, asthe County Court Judges, and the salaries of the other Sheriffs Substituteand the Sheriffs in proportion. In that event the Home Office and theLord Chancellors Department would propose a similar increase forMetropolitan Magistrates.   (Paragraphs 15 and 16.)(e) Scottish Land Court. The salary of the Chairman of the Scottish LandCourt should be increased to whatever figure be approved for the sheriff of the Lothians and Peebles.   (Paragraph 17.)if) Scottish High Court. The Departments concerned recommend considera-tion of an increase in the salaries of the Lords Ordinary from  3,600to  4,250. The Treasury suggest that it might be better to avoid anyadjustments in the High Court anywhere. A decision either way wouldnot affect the view of the Lord Chancellors Office as to the minimumincrease required for the County Court Judges.  (Paragraphs 18 to 20.)(g) The position in Northern Ireland. Salaries of the County Court Judgesare fixed by the Northern Ireland Government and were last increased in 1947. There would be little case for anything but a small further increase at the present time. Only if their salaries were increased,and an increase were given to the Lords Ordinary in Scotland, would it, in the Treasury view, be necessary for the United Kingdom Gov-
&apos; I V    t 12 &apos;ernment to contemplate any increase in the salaries of the PuisneJudges of the High Court in Northern Ireland. The Lord Chancellors. Office and the Home Office consider that the latter should be increased from  3,000 to  3,500 in any case. (Paragraphs 21 to 23.)(h) Reactions outside the Judiciary--None of the increases we have contenvplated should provoke reactions in the Civil Service, (Paragraph 11.).II.  Expenses32.  Our recommendations are summarised in paragraph 29.33.  Cost of our recommendations-These are set out in paragraph 30.(Signed)        t.
