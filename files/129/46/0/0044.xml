IrHIS -DOCUMENT -IS-THE P-R0PERT-Y OF-HIS BR-I&apos;EA-NN1G--MA4ES^-Y&apos;S-GOVERN-ME-N-T)confidential.P.(51) 194 COPY NO.   315TH JULY, 1951CABINETMAN-POWER FOR THE MINESWITHDRAWAL OF EX-MINERS FROM THE ARMED forces memorandum by the Minister of defence i have considered the proposals which the Minister of Fuel and power had made in his paper (C,P.(51) 189) for diverting man-power from the Armed Forces into the mines.    He is proposing to do this intwo main ways.First, he suggests we should try to persuade more young menabout to be called up for military service to enter the mines, and there-fore to be deferred from military service so long as they continue inthat occupation.    With this is associated the proposal that men leaving the mines, but still within the national service call-up age, should be reminded of their deferred liability to call-up, as a deterrent to theirleaving the mines.Secondly, he is proposing an extension in scope, and prolongation-tion in time, of the scheme for inviting ex-miners who are members ofthe regular Armed Forces to return to the pits, that scheme havingfinished its agreed term on 30th June.I may add that neither I nor my Department have been con-suited on these proposals, though the Minister of Fuel and Power hassent me an advance copy of his paper.On 1st February last the Cabinet agreed to proposals put forward by the Minister of Fuel and Power in C.P.(51) 6 for inviting volunteerswho had been serving in the Forces for not more than two years and whohad previously been employed in underground coalmining for at least six months to return to the mines (C.M,(51) 11th Conclusions, Minute 3),A scheme on these lines was drawn up and promulgated by the three service Departments at varying dates in the last week in February andthe first week in March.    My information is that up to some three weeks ago, the release of 1,925 ex-miners from the three Services had been authorised, and rather more than half of these had actually been released.    Some 400 further applications were awaiting disposal.Before the Cabinet took their decision on 1st February, I had pointed out the strong objections to this scheme (C.P,(51) 12),    it seemed to me quite illogical that at a time when we were taking drastic measures, including marked increases in Service emoluments, to stimulate regular recruiting to the Forces we should b.e deliberatelyinviting men to leave the Forces - men on whose training the services would have spent much time and money,    I pointed out the strain whichthe measures involved in sending our small force to Korea had imposed on the Services.
The Cabinet have recently had before them proposals from theChiefs of Staff relating to the mounting of an operation in the Persianoilfields which bring home to all of us the drastic measures involvedin mounting even one further minor operation while we are not at war.Relatively small as might be the numbers to be withdrawnfrom the Forces by an extension of the recently terminated schemefor inviting volunteers back to the mines from the regular Services, i must point out that every such step aggravates our present man-powerdifficulties in the Armed Forces, and brings nearer the prospect of having to undertake such measures as the recall to the colours of ClassZ reservists for lengthy periods, which would have a far more direeffect on the country&apos;s economy than withholding one or two thousandmen from possible service in the mines; and this apart from theeffect on public opinion of these more far-reaching proposals.Apart from this scheme for attracting volunteers from theregular Forces back to the mines, the Minister of Fuel and Power&apos;sproposals would hit Service man-power in several other ways.    TheMinister of Labour and National Service is directly concerned with theproposal regarding the persuasion of young men about to be called upfor national service to go into the mines and thus to be deferred fromcall-up.    I do not object to the claims of the mining industry being put before such young men.    But I do not think they should be told thattheir duty is to go into the mines rather than into the Forces.    Thatwould seem to me misrepresenting the relative priorities of two equallyvital aspects of our man-power problem.If it can be represented more forcefully than at present tominers who contemplate leaving the mines that they will be liable tocall-up within twenty-one days of doing so, and if it is thought that thatwill serve to persuade some of them to remain in the mines, I would see no objection.&apos;I notice in Conclusion (f) a suggestion that the Service Depart-ments should be instructed not to call up Territorials and otherreservists for annual training, though this proposal is not discussed inthe paper itself,    I would remind the Cabinet that at the instance ofthe Service Ministers and myself, the Minister of Labour and NationalService has in the past few months brought to the especial notice of allconcerned in commerce and industry the great importance this year of getting every possible Territorial and reservist to camp.    The main reason, though by no means the only one, for this action is, of course,&apos;the calling up of Z and G reservists for training with reserve unitsthis year.    It would surely offset the good effect this action has had ifwe now, as a Government, tell such men who are engaged in the miningindustry that they should not attend annual training.As regards the scheme for inviting volunteers from theregular Forces back into the mines, I am prepared to go some way tomeet the Minister of Fuel and Power&apos;s difficulties.    In view of thelate date at which the scheme, just terminated, was decided upon, I am prepared to agree to extend the present scheme for a further twomonths, and that the Service Departments should again bring the schemeto the notice of the men in the Forces, reminding them of the newterminal date for making applications.    But I cannot think that a man
who has done no more than three months mining before he joined theForces should be invited to go back to the mines.    Nor could I agreeto extend the maximum period of service in the Forces for suchvolunteers from two years to three.    Both proposals would begin tomake a very bad hole in the more experienced younger other ranks and ratings and non-commissioned officers.As an ex-Minister of Fuel and Power myself, I am not likelyto underrate the difficulties which face the present Minister in main-taining the vital coal output.    But I do urge the Cabinet, before deciding to drain away yet-further men from the Armed Forces, toconsider whether the man-power needs of the mining industry cannotbe met without measures which will disturb the balance of forces tobe made available for training and prevent the satisfactory build up offormations the Cabinet have already agreed as necessary for our defence preparations.E.S.. Ministry of Defence, S.W.1,5TH JULY, 1951.
