this   DOCUMENT-IS-TBE---P-ROPERTY OF HIS-BRITANNIC MA JES-T-Y-JS GOVERNMENT)confidential cp.(51) 21331ST JULY, 1951CABINETMARKETING OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLESMemorandum by the Minister of Local Government and PlanningAs Chairman of the Committee on Distribution aid Marketing, i submit this memorandum with which the Minister of Agriculture amFisheries and the Minister of Food are in agreement.2. At their meeting on 7th December, 1950 (C.M.(50) 83rdConclusions, Minute 6), the Cabinet authorised the Committee to arrangefor preliminary discussions, with the principal interests concerned, aboutthe establishment on an experimental basis of a number of public whole-sale auction centres for fruit and vegetables.    In the course of the dis-cussion in Cabinet, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he hopedthat the question whether the centres had a reasonable chance of payingtheir way would be closely examined during the next stage of the investi-gation.    On the basis of a report by the Working Party of Officials whichhad worked out the scheme in the first instance, the Committee reachedthe conclusion that there was no sufficient reason on financial groundswhy it should not go forward.    Any of my colleagues who wish to study the matter in detail will find the report of the Working Party among the papers of the Distribution and Marketing Committee (D.M.(51) 2).3. Subsequently the Minister of Agriculture am the Minister ofFood, with the Scottish Office, had discussions with representatives ofthe English and Scottish National Farmers&apos; Unions, and, separately,, withrepresentatives of the Agricultural Co-operative Association.    TheNational Farmers1 Union adopted a cautious attitude towards the proposal.They did not oppose it but could not guarantee that producers would use it.They pointed out a number of practical difficulties which would have to be surmounted in working out a scheme, but thought that, if these were over-come, it would arouse the interest of growers, provided the advantageswere fully publicised.    The Agricultural Co-operative Associationwelcomed the idea of an experiment in wholesale auction centreSi    They,too, stressed the importance of obtaining the confidence of growers if itwas to have a reasonable chance of success.    For this reason they con-sidered that auction centres run under the auspices of the AgriculturalCo-operative Movement, with assistance by loans or grants, were more likely to succeed than those managed by a Government-controlledcompany, though an important minority of the Agricultural Co-operativeAssociation appeared to prefer the latter structure.COPY NO. 31
4. We consider that the result of these preliminary discussionsjustify the scheme being carried further.    We therefore propose thata public company should be set up and that this company should beempowered to erect and operate one or more auction centres itself,or to assist by loans and grants any Agricultural Co-operativeAssociations who would co-operate in running auction centres, or todo both.    We ask the Cabinet to approve the scheme in principle andto authorise us, in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,to make an announcement about it when more detailed plans have beenprepared.H.D.Ministry of Local Government and planning, S.W.1,31ST JULY, 1951.
