(THIS- DOCUJViENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC-MAJESTY&apos;  GOVERNMENT)-secret.P. (51) 1511ST JUNE, 1951COPY NO.CABINETEQUAL, pay memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer must ask the Cabinet to consider whether we should now make any concession to those who are clamouring for equal pay in the public services, and if so what form the concession should take.   The Staff Side ofthe Civil Service National Whitley Council have proposed the introduction of equal pay into the non-industrial Civil Service by a gradual process whichwould keep the cost at a comparatively low level in the early years of thescheme, and delay the full impact for some time.   A reply to this proposals is overdue.   I am also under constant pressure in Parliament about thewhole question.   A decision can be taken only in the light of general policy since any move towards equal pay could not be confined to the public services.   There would be repercussions in the industrial sphere;  and oneof the most important facts to be considered is how far such repercussionswould be felt.2.    The alternativesThere are, I think, three alternatives:-(a) We can refuse to take any immediate steps to introduce equal pay.(b) We can make an early start on its gradual introduction over along period of years in the public services, hoping that thetime-table can be maintained, or at any rate not be toogreatly accelerated and that the impact on industrial occupations will not, in effect, be great at any rate duringthe early years.(c) We can make a gesture as a token of good faith - by making a smallreduction of the differential between men&apos;s and women&apos;spay in the Civil Service, hoping that this will reduce to theminimum the impact of what we do on industrial occupations.3.    A refusal to take any immediate steps to introduce equal pay in thepublic services.     This alternative raises all the political issues.   On the onehand some of my colleagues may feel that the equal pay question is no* one on which really strong feeling is held in any large section of the population.Women&apos;s organisations will, of course, be vocal and the Trade Union movementgenerally is committed to press the Government.   The opposition, it is argued,to the Governments decision will in practice be little more than a demonstration.
4. - On the other hand it can be held:-(a) that equal pay is inevitable at some point in the next decadeand the best hope of postponing its full impact is to open a small sluice rather than to build up the dam;(b) that the present Government accepted the principle as long asfour years ago, and that that being so it is impossible togo on doing nothing indefinitely;  (See Annex, paragraph for the Government Statement in 1947.)(c) that the Trades Union Congress, after its acceptance of aresolution calling on the Government to make a start on equal pay, is bound to press for action and that while itmight possibly be content for the time being with a tokengesture, could not call off its pressure without havingsecured something.5.    The alternative of introducing equal pay gradually.    This involvesstarting on a gradual process which introduces equal pay to a minimumextent in the early phases of this scheme but leads automatically to full equal pay after a given length of time.   This is the principle for which the staff side of the National Whitley Council have been pressing.   I have had this possibility examined by officials and a copy of their report is attached.My colleagues will see in paragraphs 9 to 17 of this report that, in the viewof these officials, a scheme satisfying the Staff Side&apos;s principles couldbe drawn up.   The cost of such a scheme for the Civil Service would start at no more than some  330,000 in the first year and would not risebeyond  1 million till after the fifth year, and the full impact would be delayedfor eighteen years.   Similar schemes could be drawn up for the other public services which would increase these figures by some 150%,6. But, as is recognised in the official report, the questionis not whether such a scheme in the public services would be a relativelycheap way of settling the equal pay question, but how such a scheme would affect women in industry, and whether there is any prospect whatever of holding to a long-term scheme of this sort.7. As regards industrial reactions, it might be held thatequal pay for a comparatively small section of older women in the CivilService, or as was proposed in the Staff Side scheme, some minor adjustment in the women&apos;s scales from time to time, would have virtually no reper-cussions in industry in the early years.   It would not be until equal payhad spread to a considerable section of women in the Civil Service that therewould be any marked demand in industry for similar action.8. But in my view, and in that of the Minister of Labour, thereis a grave risk that this would not be so.   It seems most likely that any actualapplication of the principle of equal pay (however slow in operation) in theCivil Service would cause an immediate demand for equal pay in industry andthat if gradual introduction in the Civil Service takes any of the forms now contemplated, the result will be not a gradual, but a rapid, introduction of equal pay throughout the country.9. All the schemes hitherto contemplated for gradual equal pay in the Civil Service have involved the concept of an ever widening category of women achieving full equal pay each successive year.   That is a perfectlynatural and normal situation in an occupation which accepts long incrementalscales and sees nothing wrong in ten women working in one room on the samejob on different rates of pay.
10. In industry it is quite different.   In industry women are paid flat rates and all women alike get the same women&apos;s rate for the job.It would be difficult for women in a factory to accept that some of their colleagues should be on a higher rate of pay because they happened to be olderor to have worked rather longer in their employment.11. If, therefore, gradual equal pay were introduced into theCivil Service in any of the forms at present envisaged and, if this led theindustrial unions to put forward equal pay claims, there is considerabledanger, so it is argued, that arbitration tribunals will feel bound to follow the Governments lead and to award equal pay for equal work.   They might ofcourse try to introduce it on a similar gradual basis.   But such a position, forthe reasons given above, could never be held.   Equal pay for some butnot all women in a trade would be swiftly followed by the concession of thesame rate for all.12. The prospect of full equal pay in industry in the near future,accompanied, inevitably, by some form of occupational family allowances,cannot be contemplated.   The estimates of an additional  400millions for equal pay and of  200 millions for family allowances given by the official committee may be exaggerated; but they give some idea of the extra load that might beplaced on costs of production.   And, of course, if full equal pay was conceded in industry, gradual equal pay in the public services would have to be turned into full equal pay at a cost of  25 millions a year in those services.13.    A &quot;gesture1.     A third alternative would be to abandon the natural approach of gradual introduction of equal pay in the Civil Service and to make a concession in a form which would produce the least damaging reactions in industry.   Itwould be necessary:^(a) to avoid any impression that such a-gesture involved giving fullequal pay to some women while not conceding it to others;(b) to adopt in the Civil Service a technique which would not be likelyto result in much greater concessions in industry.14. One way of achieving both these objectives would be to reducethe existing maximum differential of 20% in the Civil Service to one of 17-1%.Such a concession would not bring any group on to full equal pay and industry could readily and cheaply make similar reductions of 2f% in the far widerdifferentials (up to 35%) in its different trades.15. The present position in the Civil Service is that thedifferentials vary over the whole range from nothing to 20% of salary, sincethe minimum rates in recruiting grades are identical for men and women anddifferentiation is introduced gradually by the application to the women of smallerincrements.   Owing to the large numbers in the basic grades and to the highturnover, only a small proportion of women are subject to the maximumdifferential.16. If a gesture is to be made by way of a token move in thedirection of equal pay in the Civil Service, there is much to be said on grounds of equity and in order to keep the cost to a small fraction of the cost of fullequal pay, for confining the gesture to those whose differentiation from men&apos;rates is at or near the maximum of 20% and who ex hypothesi have givenlonger service.
17. There are two possibilities of this sort:-(a) A new over-riding rule that any woman who is subject to themaximum differentiation of 20y shall have thatdifferentiation reduced to 17-^%,   The trouble about this - though it is perfectly practicable - is that inthe Civil Service some important grades would get no benefit from the new rule since at no point in their scaleare they differentiated by as much as 20%.   Other gradeswould benefit only at or near the maximum.   Only in thecase of the Temporary Clerks and Typists would any considerable numbers benefit at points below the maximum.The fact that in these two grades such a disproportionatenumber of women would benefit would accentuate the anomaly.(b) A less logical but more practical alternative would be to grant one additional annual increment to all women who have already reached the maximum of their scales.   This would in factredxice the higher rates of differential between men&apos;s andwomea&apos;s pay.   It would admittedly be a rough and readyarrangement and in some cases would reduce still furthera differential already well below 29%.   Like the proposal in(a) above it would benefit only a small proportion of thewomen immediately - those already at the maximum.   Butit would benefit all grades alike and would, in course oftime, benefit all women who reached the maximum.Furthermore it would be simpler to administer and would benefit the most deserving category - the women with longestservice.18. One category of teachers who would benefit under (b) wouldnot benefit under (a) and the cost of scheme (b) for the teachers would accordingly be greater.   In the Civil Service, the cost of (a) would be greaterthan the cost of (b) because of the large number of Temporary Clerks andTypists who would benefit under (a) but not under (b).   A very rough estimate for the public services as a whole is that scheme (a) might cost  1,25 million andscheme (b)  1 million,19. The advantages of a gesture made by one of these methodsare:-(a) in theory, it would not commit us to a periodical repetition ofthe gesture;(b; it might enable the Trades Union Congress to deal with thepresent demand for pressure to be put on the Government.They could argue that the Government had done somethingas an earnest of good faith.On the other hand:-(a) We should not satisfy the protagonists.(b) The Civil Service would undoubtedly be disappointed.   A gestureon these lines is very far from their idea of gradual equal pay and in particular they would realise that the proportion
of women in the public services immediately affected on either of these token alternatives would be small,   Andthey would no doubt notice that the repercussions in industry of either of them would be likely to involveincreases (however small) for all women employed.20, In view of the disadvantage of either of the schemes inparagraph 17 that they only immediately affect some of the women, I have considered the possibility of some adjustment in the public services whichwould have more nearly universal immediate effects;   The only practicalscheme of this kind which has been suggested to me is one for giving all women forthwith one increment on their present scales, subject of course totheir not exceeding the men&apos;s rates.   The effect of this at the maxima of the scales would not be widely different from the scheme at paragraph 17(b )above, but of course a far larger number of women would be affected andthe area at the bottom part of many scales in which men&apos;s and women&apos;rates are identical would be extended.   There is no doubt that it wouldbe much more acceptable to the Staff Side than either of the suggestions inparagraph 17,   But naturally it Would be a good deal more costly.   For thepublic services as a whole the cost would approach  5 millions, i. e. about one^fifth of the total cost of full equal pay in those services.   But to reducethe general increase to (say) one half of a normal increment would not onlyseriously distort the scale structure but would correspond to no more thana lift of If % of the men&apos;s rate in the typical case and would produce almostderisory cash increases.   For instance, the increase at the  400 level would be  5 a year.21. Each of the alternative courses which I have suggestedraise important political considerations and I should welcome the views ofmy colleagues on the one which we should adopt.H.

*      10THIS  DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY   OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYS  GOVERNMENTCONFIDENTIALANNEXEQUAL PAY FOR MEN AND WOMEN IN THE CIVIL SERVICEReport by Officials to the Chancellor of the exchequer. Recent History of the claim the Government acceptance of the principle but refusal to implement becauseof cost. On 11th June, 1947, Mr. Dalton made a statement in the House ofCommons of which the following is an extract: -&quot; The Government are, of course, primarily concerned with the problemof Equal Pay for Equal Work within the field of public employment andespecially in the non-industrial Civil Service, the Local Government Serviceand the teaching profession, but in the Governments view there could be noquestion of confining Equal Pay to these occupations. Its introduction in industry and in other professions would inevitably follow.&quot; As a broad affirmation of a general principle the Government, as regards their own employees, accept the justice of the claim that there should be no difference in payment for the same work in respect of sex .... Such acceptanceleaves open the very important practical question of when effect should begiven to this principle, and over what range of cases. The Government are definitely of the opinion that this principle cannot be applied at the presenttime ....&quot; The estimated cost of the immediate introduction of Equal Pay in thepublic services alone would be more than  24 million a year that is to say, 10 million for the Civil Service,  1.1 million for teachers and  3\. million forother local government staff .... The cost of Equal Pay for teachers wouldgradually rise by a further  6 million a year. When the National health service comes into force the Exchequer will take over the cost not only of localgovernment nurses, for whom Equal Pay would cost  2,750,000 out of the 3  million already mentioned, but also of the voluntary hospital nurses, for whom it would cost a further  5 million.....&quot; The cost of Equal Pay for women in the Armed Forces would be between 3 and  6 million a year. Moreover, if the pay of unmarried women were raised to equality with that of married men, ... - there would undoubtedly beclaims which might soon be of universal application for a system of occupa-tional family allowances. The cost of these might well reach a very high figure.&apos; &quot; This heavy burden .... would be increased as Equal Pay extended to theindustrial employees of the Crown and of the Local Authorities. At the sametime the new public boards and the whole body of occupations and trades in private industry would also have to face heavy expenditure on Equal Pay2.  Three points arise from this statement and the exchanges which followed.3. First, there can be no hope of confining Equal Pay to a restricted field, forexample, the non-industrial Civil Service. If a start is made in this area, it is onlya question of time before the whole wages and salary structure of the country isdrastically altered.4. Second, at that time there was no official Government policy of wage restraint and, though the Government took the view that equal pay would involve an intolerable addition to the costs of production, it was not then stated publicly, asit was later, that considerations of wage restraint as such precluded the introductionof the principle.5. Third, Mr. Dalton was asked to consider spreading the cost by introducing the principle on some gradual basis. He said that he would be prepared to look at this but eventually decided that nothing could then be done.    -
6. Subsequent history.-In February 1948 (shortly after the issue of the white paper on Personal Incomes Costs and Prices (Cmd. 7321), but well before the postdevaluation wage freeze) the Staff Side of the National Whitley Council wrote toSir Stafford Cripps suggesting a scheme for the gradual introduction of the principle in the non-industrial Civil Service and asking him to receive a deputation. ThisSir Stafford Cripps agreed to do and made it clear that he was in marked sympathy with the claim but that the White Paper, which emphasised the need for a large measure of restraint in the matter of wages and salaries, made it impossible to meetthe claim in. the then circumstances. There was thus a second hurdle for the staff side to overcome, namely that of Government wage restraint policy.7. No further development took place, apart from attempts by Staff Associa-tions to bring pressure to bear on candidates at the last General Election to press for equal Pay if they were returned, until a second deputation from the Staff Side ofthe National Whitley Council was received on 3rd January, 1951, by the presentChancellor.  On this occasion the Staff Side made three main points: - (i) The immediate cost of the scheme for gradual introduction which they proposed was negligible in relation to the total salary bill of the non-industrial Civil Service (about  1 million on a salary bill of  287 million).(ii) Economic circumstances had improved so greatly that the need for extremerestraint as urged in the post-devaluation freeze period had to someextent at any rate diminished. The time was therefore, in their view,opportune for beginning to introduce Equal Pay in the Civil Service.(iii) They made it clear that they would accept any instalment scheme, how-ever cheap, provided that a start could be made now.II-The Current Problem8.  There are then four questions to be considered :(1) Can a cheap and sensible scheme be devised for the non-industrial CivilService? By sensible we mean one that will not be intolerably complexto administer nor demonstrable unfair as between different women inthe Service.(2) Would such a scheme be consistent with the White Paper on personal incomes, Costs and Prices?(3) What reactions would such a scheme have and how much would theycost?(4) Would the total cost of (1) and (3) be impossible to contemplate in present economic circumstances?III. Is the Gradual Introduction of Equal Pay in the non-Industrial CivilService Practicable?9. Can a cheap and sensible scheme be devised for the non-industrial CivilService? The answer is that it almost certainly can. Two alternatives have so far been produced.10. The Staff Side&apos;s scheme. This is based on giving all women simul-taneously Equal Pay in part. It involves a complicated juggling over a period ofyears with the scales of women in such a way as eventually to make them the sameas those of the men. It certainly appears cheap, having been estimated to cost 1 million in the first year, rising to  7 million, after between 12 and 18 years. Itfails, however, to satisfy the second criterion, being neither administratively simplenor fair. We suspect and there is some evidence for our suspicion-that once thewomen affected fully understood how it was to operate, they would bring heavy pressure to bear for rectification of many of the anomalies. Such pressure wouldbe difficult to resist and could easily add substantially to the estimated cost. Sincethe Staff Side made it clear at the recent deputation that they would be willing toaccept any scheme, we do not propose to develop in detail the objections to their particular selection, but to turn to 11. The Official Side&apos;s scheme-This is based on giving Equal Pay in full to different groups of women at different times. The criterion for benefit we suggestis length of civil service. There are two main variations of this scheme. First, we
- can say that all women, when and as they complete X years of service (25 or 30),will then receive Equal Pay in full. The objection to this is that it is a never endingprocess and will completely fail to satisfy the chief Staff Side demand, which is to start a self-perpetuating process which-no matter in how dim and distant a future-will eventually give all women Equal Pay and end the business.12. We have therefore been examining the second variation which each yearlets in groups of women with ever shorter lengths of service until finally the newentrant receives Equal Pay in full. In other words, in the first year of the schemethose women with, say, 30 years&apos; service or more will go to the point on the men&apos;sscale corresponding to that which they have reached on the women&apos;s: in the second year women with, say 25 and under 30 years&apos; service would receive the same treat-ment. And so on until all women received Equal Pay.13. Preliminary calculations have been worked out for established civilservants, since it is only for them that central records are available, and they suggest a scheme on the lines of Appendix I. The dates, of courseware purely arbitrary and intended only to illustrate the scheme. It would take 18 years to complete. Thecost would be no more than  330,000 in the first year but each year the charge would increase by an amount ranging from  120,000 to  370,000 till the maximumannual charge of  5 million was reached after 18 years. It must be said at once that these calculations are necessarily very rough and ready; for example, we haveto assume . that the numbers in the various &quot;length of service&quot; groups remainmore or less constant throughout the years.14. This estimate, moreover, excludes sympathetic increases to grades con-fined to women and also the cost for temporary staff. Equally it takes no accountof the temporary service before establishment of established civil servants. Torefine the calculations, it would be necessary to seek information from departments and this is clearly premature. It can, however, be assumed that temporary staff,since for the most part they have relatively short service, would not begin to benefit for a number of years. The best guess we can make is that the maximum annual cost of Equal Pay in the Civil Service for established staff (which we have suggestedin paragraph 14 would be  5 million reached after 18 years) would be increasedby a further  5 million by payments to temporary staff and by sympathetic increases.The effect of payments to temporary staff would be negligible in the early years ofthe scheme ill view of their relatively short service, and we doubt whethersympathetic increases Would be necessary until equal pay had reached a substantial proportion of women civil servants.15. Putting the proposition very crudely, we suggest that under this schemeEqual Pay could be introduced into the Civil Service:  (a) over a period of 18 years;(b) at a maximum annual cost of  10 million reached in the 18th year;(c) at a cost in the first year of  330,000. This charge would rise progressivelyeach year until the maximum charge Was reached in the 18th year.In the early years the rate of progression would be slow, not more than an extra  250,000 being added to the bill in each year of the first nine years of the scheme. From then on the effect of sympathetic increases and the inclusion of temporary staff would be felt and the curve ofadditional expenditure in each of the next nine years would rise moresteeply.16. Such a scheme satisfies our second criterion, that of fairness and simplicity.It is broadly parallel to the principle which governed demobilisation in the last war, that is to say, &quot;first in, first out.&quot; It gives the women who have served the longest their Equal Pay in full at once, and avoids the anomaly of new entrants to the Service benefiting at the expense of the old hands. We thus suggest that itwould,commend itself to the women and would be regarded as fair by public and parliamentary opinion. Equally, though the planning of the scheme would be complicated, its administration, should not present any great difficulties. Finally,the principle at least seems readily capable of extension to other public servicesemploying women.17. Would the Scheme be Consistent with Government Wages Policy ? It-seems reasonable to assume that we have now moved away not only from the period?of complete and utter restraint following devaluation, but also from the period
in which we were trying to enforce the original White Paper in its strictest sense.We attempted to defend the latter line at the recent hearing before the arbitration tribunal on the pay of the key grade of Clerical Officers and failed; It is now agreed that we focus our attention on keeping wage, increases down to modestamounts. In other words, instead of dividing pay claims into those which areadmissible under the White Paper on Personal Incomes, Costs and Prices (Cmd.7321) and those which are not, meeting the former in full and the latter not at all,we are trying to settle all justifiable claims on the most modest terms which we cannegotiate, i If this interpretation of the White Paper be accepted, a gradual intro-duction of Equal Pay on the plan outlined above can perhaps be regarded as not inconsistent with the spirit of the White Paper, though a hostile critic could fairlyargue that, since the need for restraint continues, this is a poor moment at which to introduce Equal Pay.18. The foregoing considerations apply to the Government^ wage policy towards its own employees and other questions must be taken into account in considering the effect upon national wages policy as a whole. In recent years thepolicy governing Civil Service wages has been to follow the practice of goodemployers in outside employment, and generally to refrain from making innovationsin standards of employment.19. Any promise by the Government that they would introduce Equal Paywhether by stages or all at once might therefore be criticised on the following grounds:  -(a) that the Government is initiating ia course of action which other employers would not wish or be able to follow;(b) that although a general upward movement of wages is in progress thegeneral considerations in the White Paper have lost none of their forceand that Government action to introduce Equal Pay would set upinflationary tendencies by raising wages without increasing production;(c) that the introduction of Equal Pay would not reduce the pressure for generalwage increases but might through inflationary pressure accelerate awages-prices spiral;(d) that the Government would be departing from the well-established principleof following movements in industry and, by setting the example, wouldbe starting a new policy that might have widespread reactions in thefuture. Against this, however, it is fair to say that Equal Pay will never be introduced unless the Government gives a lead.IV. Equal Pay for non-Industrial Staff in other Areas of the Public service is Gradual Introduction Practicable?20. Two general questions have to be answered for these employments, onthe assumption that they will inevitably follow any lead given by the Governmentin the non-industrial Civil Service. First, can reasonable schemes for gradual intro-duction be evolved?  Second, how much would such schemes cost?21. Local Government: Administrative and Clerical Grades. Unless we areto approach local government authorities at this stage, which seems unwise, we canonly make certain guesses. Equal Pay is already in operation except in the generalClerical and Higher clerical divisions (i.e., Equal Pay is already in operation at thehigher levels). In the section where it is not yet operative the number of womenis 31,000 and by a proportionate sum based on the figures given below for theNational Health Service we arrive at an estimate of the eventual maximum annual cost for local government of about  1 - 8 million. There is no reason to suppose that the application of Equal Pay could not be spread in local government over aperiod of about 20 years in the same general way as we have suggested is possiblefor the non-industrial Civil Service.22. The Teaching Profession.-On the basis of the number of women teachersexpected to be in post at 1st April, 1951, and of the new Burnham scales which will then come into effect, it is estimated that the eventual annual cost of Equal Pay infull would be of the order of  11-5* million. It can be assumed that some form* The original estimate of  17 million prepared at the time of the Royal Commission assumedan increase in the proportion of women to men teachers which has rtot in fact taken place.
of gradual introduction in the teaching profession is possible in principle though no details have been worked out.23. The Health Service: Administrative and Clerical Grades. The officegrades in the National Health Service follow the local authority pattern, i.e., equal pay already exists at the higher levels. The number of women with unequal pay isnot at present known accurately, but will be known in a few months&apos; time whencertain returns are received. Broadly speaking, however, some 13,000 women are involved and the eventual annual cost of introducing Equal Pay at present rates would be about  800,000. This estimate would be affected by any increase whichmay follow from a salary claim which is under consideration, and by any reorganisa-tion of the Administrative and Clerical grades structure which is also underconsideration.24. The method proposed for the Civil Service by the Official Side based on service would not work in the case of Health Service staff. &quot; Superannuable ser-vice &quot; would exclude service in voluntary hospitals where there were no pensions schemes: &quot; reckonable service &quot;might, on the other hand, exclude some previouslocal authority service which would nevertheless be &quot; superannuable &quot;;. and under any of these systems it would not be possible to take account of any previous clericalemployment in other types of post than hospital or local authority. There is noequivalent in-the Health Service to &quot;service&quot; in the Civil Service where most ofthe staff come into the Service on leaving school and stay in it, and where the lengthof service test is thus appropriate. The only alternative in the Health Service gradesseems to be age. This would satisfy the criterion of simplicity and also mightappeal to the staff concerned as being fairer than service as a basis for a graduatedintroduction of Equal Pay.25. Nursing Field. In the nursing field the woman&apos;s rate is regarded as themeasure of the job, and above the grade of Ward Sister/Charge Nurse, Equal Payhas been introduced. Below that grade men receive  10- 15 more than the women in the corresponding grades. The number of men is much the smaller, and logically,since this is regarded as being overwhelmingly a woman&apos;s job, the men should be assimilated to the women&apos;s rates. This is clearly not a feasible proposition in isolation from the introduction of compensating allowances for married men, unless it is done at some future date by merging the mCn&apos;s lead if an increase in the women&apos;rates is given. The cost of bringing women up to the present men&apos;s rates in the grades affected in the nursing field would be  475,000* per annum^ plus  230,000 forthe 19,000 odd nursing staff still employed by local authorities. It might, however,be possible to secure a cheaper settlement by merely giving, nurses some form ofsympathetic increases on some gradual basis.V. Industry. Repercussions of the Gradual Introduction of Equal Pay in thenon-Industrial Civil Service and other Public Services26. The total working population for November .1950 was 16,161,000,including 7,397,000 females. The main fields of female employment were in retaildistributive, textile, clothing and other industrial groups, details of which are givenin the following tables:-Industry Female workersDistributive trades    ......      ...      ....... 1,130,800Engineering and allied trades ...      ......      ... 746,000Textiles...................... 604,800Clothing         ...      .,..........      ... 479,700Food, drink and tobacco    ...      ...      ...      ... 322,300Paper and printing   .........      ...      ... 192,200Chemical and allied trades    ......      ...      ... 136,400Other manufacturing industries     ...      ...      ... 107,80027. The national wage bill for 1949 was estimated at  4,280 million, andprobably about  685 million or 16 per cent, was received by female weekly wage earners. On the assumption that all female workers received 60 per cent, of the* The original estimate, prepared at the time of the Royal Commission, of about  7 million for Nurses seems to have entirely discounted the value of the emoluments in kind which were thenpart of female, but not male remuneration.
earnings of male workers (see below), their share of the national wages total wouldin the long run have to be raised by over  400 million a year to reach parity,withmale workers as a whole.28. The general practice in industrial employment is that men and women are not normally engaged on the same work; the tendency is for men to do the skilled Work (for which apprenticeship is the normal preparation) or laborious,dirty or dangerous jobs. Women workers are usually regarded as most suited tothe occupations or trades requiring manual dexterity. Almost invariably femaleworkers are paid at a lower rate than males in the same industry.29. The largest industrial group which does not conform closely to these general tendencies is cotton weaving, in which substantial numbers of men andwomen are employed on the same operations and are paid at the same rates. In oneor two other sections of the cotton and woollen textile industries, men and women are also employed on similar work at a common rate of pay. Under these circum-stances, however, male workers usually try to earn more than comparable women workers either by operating more machines (as in cotton weaving or cotton beamwarping) or by working on a night shift (as in the case of Yorkshire wool-combers).During the war some industries made agreements providing for the employmentof women on jobs usually done by men. Most of these agreements provided that women shall be paid either the full rates for men (usually after a qualifying period or subject to ability to do men&apos;s work without extra assistance or supervision) or a specified proportion of the men&apos;s rates. Women are still employed under the termsof these agreements in some trades; for example^ engineering, and by the london transport Executive as bus conductors.30. Within the field of industrial employment the relative wages paid to menand women vary within wide limits and it is not practicable to point to a general level of women&apos;s wages, in relation to men&apos;s.

earnings of male workers (see below), their share of the national wages total wouldin the long run have to be raised by over  400 million a year to reach parity withmale workers as a whole.28. The general practice in industrial employment is that men and women are not normally engaged on the same work; the tendency is for men to do the skilled work (for which apprenticeship is the normal preparation) or laborious,dirty or dangerous jobs. Women workers are usually regarded as most suited tothe occupations or trades requiring manual dexterity. Almost invariably femaleworkers are paid at a lower rate than males in the same industry.29. The largest industrial group which does not conform closely to these general tendencies is cotton weaving, in which substantial numbers of men andwomen are employed On the same operations and are paid at the same rates. In oneor two other sections of the cotton and woollen textile industries, men and women are also employed on similar work at a common rate of pay. Under these circum-stanees, however, male workers usually try to earn more than comparable women workers either by operating more machines (as in cotton weaving or cotton beamWarping) or by working on a night shift (as in the case of Yorkshire wool-combers).During the war some industries made agreements providing for the employmentof women on jobs usually done by men. Most of these agreements provided that women shall be paid either the full rates for men (usually after a qualifying period or subject to ability to do men&apos;s work without extra assistance or supervision) or a specified proportion of the men&apos;s rates. Women are still employed under the termsof these agreements in some trades; for example j engineering, and by the london transport Executive as bus conductors.30. Within the field of industrial employment the relative wages paid to menand women vary within wide limits and it is not practicable to point to a general level of women&apos;s wages in relation to men&apos;s.

31. Gradual Introduction-There can clearly be no general plan for a uniformgradual introduction of Equal Pay throughout industry and it is impossible to fore-cast the timing and incidence of the additional cost which would be incurred whenindustry felt that the gradual introduction of equal pay in the public services had reached such a point that they would have to introduce it in their, case withoutany attempt at graduation. There is always the danger that industry as a whqlemight move a good dealer faster than We propose for the Civil Service. If this happened, we should doubtless be asked to accelerate our scheme so that its costmight in fact be spread over a much shorter period than originally planned. More-over, in industry itself it cannot be assumed that the cost would be substantially reduced by confining Equal Pay to those areas where women and men are employedon &quot; equal &quot; work. For the grant of Equal Pay in these areas would tend to cause a general and substantial rise in women&apos;s rates throughout industry, partly becauseof competition for female labour and partly because of claims for the retention of pay relativities between the various women&apos;s occupational groups. A more detailed analysis by the Ministry of Labour of the general position is attached as appendix III.32. Government Industrial Service. In the Government Service there are about 400,000 industrial employees, of whom between 25,000 and 30,000 are women and girls. The basis of their pay there is as follows. On engineering work womenreceive the men&apos;s basic pay plus 75 per cent, of the bonus. In shell factories they receive the rate for youths aged 20. In light engineering work they are paidaccording to the women&apos;s schedule adopted in the engineering industry. In filling factories they receive the women&apos;s schedule rates plus 35. In explosive factoriesthey receive 80 per cent, of the men&apos;s rate. In addition to these there are women employed on other semi-skilled jobs paid on the M. rate basis; in such a case they receive 75 per cent, of the men&apos;s rate plus the full leads.33.   Government industrial employees fall in three groups:  (i) Those paid expressly on trade rates.   It is clear that these would have tofollow any arrangements made in these would have to follow any arrangements made in their respective trades for the payment of women.(ii) Engineering and shipbuilding employees whose rates are settled on JointCouncils for Government employees, where, however, the rates in therespective industries form the basis of the Government rate. Here theGovernment has more scope to act independently but would certainlywish to do nothing to embarrass outside industries,(iii) Those paid on M. rates.   Since these Government rates are not directly related to those outside the Service but based on a fair average of suchoutside rates, it would be easier for the Government to introduce equal pay or something like it in this field ahead of outside employers.34. No gradual introduction of equal pay for Government industrialemployees which depended either upon an incremental system or years of service would be satisfactory, but in some cases, especially for those paid on M. rates, equal pay might be introduced gradually by the annual increase of the percentage whichthe women&apos;s rate bears to the men&apos;s. One difficulty which would have to be facedif that were done is that the female staff are not formally categorised as:  (a) those doing a man&apos;s job and therefore paid a proportion of the man&apos;s rate;and(b) those doing a woman&apos;s job and therefore qualified only for sympatheticincreases.The cost of bringing the wages of all women industrial employees up to the malerate would at present be about  1  million a year; but if, as might be expected, about half the present women&apos;s jobs were found to be women&apos;s work and so to beremunerated still on women&apos;s rates the cost would be reduced to  750,000 a year.35. National Health Service Ancillary, i.e., industrial grades. The positionis broadly the same as in the Government industrial field (see paragraph 33 above).The numbers are 88,000 and the eventual annual cost of full Equal Pay would be some  5,500,000.36. The Armed Forces. Women employed in the Armed Forces are inter-Changeable with men over large areas, and especially in anti-aircraft and the ground
branches of the R.A.F. But, as was recognised by the Royal Commission in 1946,they are in a special position in that they are wholly exempt from actual combatand the use of personal lethal weapons forms no part of their training. Also theiroperational responsibilities even in peace-time are lighter than the men&apos;s, particu-larly in the case of officers. Their present pay is three-quarters of men&apos;s as corn-pared with the normal four-fifths for equal work, and this recognises the fact that women in the Forces do not do the same work as men. On these grounds, itshould be possible, with the support of public opinion, to resist any demands forthe application of Equal Pay to the Women&apos;s Services, even if it is introduced inother fields of Government Service. The Service Departments might, however, press for sympathetic increases for them to say four-fifths on the analogy of grades con-fined to women referred to in paragraph 15 above. If such sympathetic increases were given in the Civil Service it might be difficult to resist them in the armed forces at a cost of about  250,000 a year. In view of the relatively small cost itseems doubtful whether an attempt at gradualism should be made.VI. Occupational Family Allowances37. There does not appear to have been any change in circumstances whichwould now permit the introduction of Equal Pay without accompanying family allowances. It is still the case that Equal Pay in itself would leave the married men with families economically worse off than any other class of the community,and the Royal Commission^ recommendation that the problem could best be solved by occupational family allowances seems as sensible now as it did in 1947.38. Cost of Family Allowances in the non-industrial Civil Service-Alternative schemes for Family Allowances were drawn up after the RoyalCommission. Details of these schemes are given in Appendix II. These schemesmay well need recasting but they give some indication of the order of expenditure involved. The cheapest scheme was estimated to cost  2-5 million, the mostgenerous  8 - 3 million. The mean figure of  5 million might be taken as a roughindication of the expenditure that might be required.39. Could Family Allowances be introduced in the Civil Service gradually. On the assumption that Equal Pay could be introduced gradually in the CivilService, it should be possible to introduce family allowances also by stages. Thereare two alternative approaches:  (a) Start the allowance at a small fraction of its ultimate figure and increasethe fraction as equal pay gathers way under the scheme proposed inparagraphs 11-12.   .(b) Give no family allowances until Equal Pay has reached a substantial pro-portion of women civil servants.40. Both schemes are considered in greater detail in Appendix II. Theywould only be practicable if gradual equal pay proved feasible.41. Family allowances in the Public Services. The cost might be taken atthe same figure of  5 million suggested for the Civil Service. Gradual introductionwould be practicable on the same lines.42. Family allowances. in industry--The cost might be of the order of 200 million. Gradual introduction would almost certainly be impracticable andthe allowances would be demanded even in those branches of industry where equal pay was not introduced.&quot;43. At the moment, in the argument about Equal Pay, all other considerations are drowned by the cry for &quot; equity &quot; as between men and women doing the samejob. When Equal Pay has been introduced and it is seen how much more favour-able is the position of unmarried women than that of married men with dependents,the demand will undoubtedly be changed to that of an &quot; equal standard of living &quot;for men and women workers doing the same job. We have seen a beginning ofthis movement in recent pronouncements by the National Association of School-masters, and it will certainly spread, and neither the demand nor its satisfactionwill be confined to those sections of industry where logic would keep it. The resultof equal pay will probably be to raise the women&apos;s rates in the rest of industry,and, therefore, relatively to diminish the standard of living of men in the same
iii: - &quot;-&apos; -MM MM &apos;   9  MMM . . - .&apos; Mindustry. The demand for occupational family allowances will, therefore, applyto those groups also and all the more because the men will compare themselves both with the women in their own industry and with men in other industries more directly affected by equal pay who are gaining the advantage, of occupational family allowances. We think, therefore, that we must expect ultimately a more or lessuniversal adoption of occupational family allowances, and it is only on this basis that equal pay will be practical politics. It cannot, for example, be assumed thatallowances could be withheld from those branches of industry that are paid bypiece-work on the grounds that in most cases the men earn more than the women.The men will either demand to be treated in the same way as other men on timerates, or they will demand the abolition of piece-work and its replacement byhigh time-rates. Equally, while there would be little logical justification for acompensatory allowance to the men in a trade where women are only,a small minority, in practice it would be extremely difficult to hold the position.VII. Ultimate Maximum Cost44. For convenience we summarise below the ultimate cost of Equal Pay and family Allowances in the Public Services and in industry.Equal PayNon-industrial staff * in-  millionCivil Service   ...      ...                               - 10 RLocal Government    ...     &apos;......      ...... j.-5Health Service (Clerical)...............

Even if all this expenditure could be spread in more or less even amountsover a period of 20 years, it would produce an addition of  30 million each year tothe costs of production and of  1 million to rates and taxes. And there seems tous to be a very real danger that outside the Service gradualism would tend to behonoured more in the breach than the observance with inevitable repercussionswithin the Service.VIII.-The Arguments for and against Introducing Equal Pay Gradually intothe Civil Service and other Public Services at the Present Time.46. Arguments in favour of introducing Equal Pay now. The first argumentis that it is most unlikely that in the foreseeable future any moment will presentitself as truly opportune for the introduction of the principle.  Unless, therefore,* We have not provided an estimate for non-industrial staff outside the public services,t This charge would not fall on the Exchequer or rates.t This charge would not fall on the Exchequer or rates apart from a small proportion (say 3 million for industrial staff in the Civil Service and other public services):
it is to be put into virtually indefinite cold storage, some unsuitable moment mustbe chosen and it is not clear that the present is conspicuously inopportune. Is there any evidence that the general financial and economic position is likely to improvewithin the next, say, five years? And, if not, is it desirable and practicable to resort to indefinite stonewalling on an issue where the Government is committed inprinciple?47. The second argument is that the additional annual cost for non-industrial workers would not, in fact, be very great, if the introduction of Equal Pay can bespread, over so long a period as 18 years or thereabouts. On the assumption thatit will only be of the order of  2 million, is this burden really insupportable? Asto industry generally, it might be said that there would be no marked change inpractice. As stated in paragraph 30, there has been a steady tendency for manyyears for women&apos;s wages to rise in relation to men&apos;s and it might merely be thatthis trend would become somewhat accentuated if Equal Pay was being graduallyintroduced for non-industrial workers. In other words, though the figure of 600 million for giving Equal Pay in full at once looks formidable, if the presenttrend continues, this sum or something like it will in fact be paid out in theordinary way over the next x years. (Against this, however, there are signs thatthis trend is gradually coming to an end.) The introduction of Equal Pay for non-industrial workers might only mean that the period would become x-y and this might not be appreciably shorter than x. Equally, since wages are already risingat the rate of about 5 per cent, per annum, this in itself means an annual additionof about  200 million to the wages bill and, set against this, the additional annual cost of gradual equal pay of perhaps  30 million is not fantastic. If the country can stand an annual addition of some 5 per cent, on a bill of  2,480,000,000, canit not stand a further annual increase of perhaps 1 per cent.?48. Arguments against introducing Equal Pay now. While there may beargument as to what might or might not be a suitable moment for introducingEqual Pay, it will be argued that the present is demonstrably unsuitable. Thecountry is faced.with the heavy burden of rearmament and the terms of trade aremoving against us.- Sacrifices will be demanded of all if serious inflation is to be avoided and such sacrifices can hardly be reconciled with a gesture on the part ofthe Government involving the release of extra spending power for the sake of adoctrinaire principle. Women generally are at least as well off in relation to menas they were four years ago.49. Even if it were true that in industry generally women&apos;s rates are movingsteadily nearer those of men, and, as stated in paragraph 47, this assumption is morethan doubtful), on present trends it would take 58 years before full equality were reached. If the Government announce that they are making a start in the CivilService and propose to complete the operation in 18 years, the trend outside wouldbe drastically accentuated. In other words, in the equation in paragraph 47, x-ywould be very much less than x. Equally, it might well be that outside the CivilService gradualism would rapidly degenerate into a mere token under pressure fromemployees-pressure which employers might well find hard to resist. Not only would this make for inflation outside the Service but it would also certainly provokethe Service itself to ask that the period of, say, 18 years should be cut to, say, five.And such a demand would also be hard to resist. Hence heavy unforeseen additionalGovernment expenditure might be required at quite an early stage of the scheme&apos;sdevelopment. i . .50. Conclusion-We have not attempted to weigh the balance between the moral and political advantages on the one hand of starting on the application of a principle which the Government have accepted; and on the other of taking a step which may lead to a very substantial change in the national wages- structure andindeeci a distortion of the situation produced by the operation of the market andthe free play Of collective bargaining. But the arguments against such a step, at atime when; other factors are making for inflation seem to us very powerful. Theright time to take such a step would appear to be when (if ever) the situation is suchas to lead the Government to welcome an increase in.rather than the checking of personal incomes.with May, 1951.

After the report of the Royal Commission on Equal Pay, a committee of officials put forward alternative schemes for family allowances in the non-industrial civil Service. These proposals were not published or approved but give some ideaof the order of expenditure that might be involved. The figures have been correctedto allow for changes in the number and composition of the Civil Service.2.   The three schemes proposed were as follows: -Scheme A: the cheapestCost of a  40 allowance, excluding the first child and abated by &apos;the.statutory family allowance:  2,565,000. ...Scheme B: the most expensiveCost of a  40 allowance, including the first child and unabated by thestatutory family allowance:  8,360,000.Between these two extremes there are a number of Variations, e.g.:-Scheme C: \&apos;Cost of a  40 allowance, excluding the first child but unabated by thestatutory family allowance:  3,800,000.3. Could any of these schemes be introduced gradually? There are two ways in which gradual introduction would be possible :-(a) by starting the allowance at some figure lower than  40 and working up tothis figure in step with the gradual introduction of equal pay; or(b) introducing the allowance we fall at the point when equal pay had reached a substantial proportion of women Civil Servants. The incidence of costunder the two alternatives is discussed below. v       .    .:.
4. If family allowances were started at a figure lower than  40 and increased in step with the introduction of equal pay, the expenditure which would be involvedat different phases- in the operation under schemes (A) and. (B) (described in para-graph 3 above) would be as follows:  The cheap scheme (Scheme A)-&quot; First five years ...Second five years  ...Third five years    ...Next three yearsLast year   ......The expensive scheme (Scheme B)-Aynount of allowance&apos;  2025303540First six years ...      ...... 10Second six years ...      ...... 20Third six years ......      ... 30Last year   ... ...      ...      ... 40(N.B.

It would then beintroduced in full, i.e., at a cost in that year of  2-5 million,  8-6 or  3-8 millionaccording asJ Scheme A, Bor C was adopted.. &quot;: - * &apos;)V.,.6.. The argument in favour of the first method is that it spreads the cost evenlyover the years; that against, it, :and thus in favour of tjie second, is that it seems oddto give large numbers of married men some &quot; equal pay &quot; increase when only a very few women will be receiving one. Why should every young postman with a wife and children receive an increase merely because o, handful of very old women clerksare getting equal pay?&quot; It is suggested that, subject to any overriding financial considerations, the choice of methods would he appropriate for discussion on theNational Whitley Council.APPENDIX HI -Note by the Ministry of Labour on the Effect of the Introduction of ..,;Equal Pay in the Public Services .1. The proposals in the paper for gradual implementation of equal pay in thepublic services seem, in themselves, to be reasonable and practicable, but such a gesture by the Government at a time when industrial wages are swinging upwardswould tend to create new risks of wage inflation in industry. Last year the TradesUnion Congress, against the advice of the General Council, passed a resolution infavour of the practical application of the principle of equal pay, and as soon as anystep is taken by the Government to bring equal pay into force it seems inevitable that claims for equal pay in some industries would be presented without delay. Itshould also be pointed out that the International Labour Conference in June willbe considering the terms of proposed International Regulations which would layobligations on Governments which accept the Regulations to promote the principleof equal pay not only in the public service but over the whole field of employment.We shall be seeking instructions from Ministers as to the line to be taken in theConference discussions. While a decision now taken in favour of the immediate introduction of a scheme for gradual implementation of equal pay in the publicservice would not necessarily affect the line to be taken at the Conference, it maywell make it more difficult for the United Kingdom delegation to secure the neces-sary discretionary safeguards in the Regulations (particularly as they affectemployment outside the public service) which will be desirable if the Governmentis subsequently to be in a position to accept the Regulations, which they will certainly be pressed to do.
2. It is not likely that any agreement to introduce equal pay into any partof industry would be done by instalments spread over a long period and as soonas the principle is adopted in any one Of the major fields of women&apos;s employmentit would exercise a strong influence over women&apos;s rates for all employments. Thisinfluence would operate quite independently of actual claims for equal pay in any industry and would make itself felt through competition for female labour and claims for the retention of pay relativities between the various women&apos;s occupa-tional groups. For example, the Amalgamated Engineering Union would probablybe one of the first unions to claim equal pay: any agreement in the engineering industry would probably be based on a stricter demarcation of men&apos;s and women&apos;work, with equality of pay for certain occupations common to both sexes and anincrease in pay for the women employed on women&apos;s work. An increase of pay for women in those engineering occupations would inevitably encourage upwardwage movements for women workers in all the occupations which compete withengineering for similar types of women workers. In so far as such competitivewage movements were not related to equal pay principles in the industries con-cerned, trade unions would be likely to claim differential increases for their malemembers.3. Another large trade group where a claim for equal pay would have far-reaching consequences would be retail distribution where over a million women are employed under Statutory Orders made by the Minister. The Orders define theduties of shop assistants and other grades of worker without reference to the sexof the worker so that it could not be argued that the work done by women wasdifferent from the work done by men. Even supposing some means could befound to give women distributive workers equal pay by instalments, the effect ondistributive costs and cost of living would be appreciable.4. Increased rates for women shop assistants would be felt in many directions;for example, in the laundry trade where equality of work between men and womendoes not arise, employers would he obliged to raise their women workers&apos; wagestowards the shop assistants&apos; level. Moreover, the old belief that equal pay would lead employers to use men in preference to women workers could not apply to the modern labour structure of many industries, where women are preferred on their merits for light routine work, or during the shortage of workers which is likely tobe experienced for years to come.5. The effects of full employment and the relatively higher demand forwomen workers than for men would ensure that as soon as equal pay for equalwork is secured in any one of the main industrial fields the criterion of &quot; equalwork &quot; would be rendered almost meaningless by competition for female labour.Moreover, the trade unions, while continuing to pay lip-service to the principlesof Equal Pay would probably utilise any upward movement of women&apos;s rates forthe benefit of their male members.6. These were the considerations which were in mind in preparing a simpleestimate of the cost of equal pay based on the belief that equal pay principles couldnot be limited to the industries where female workers could reasonably claim equal value for their work. The effect of one or two successful claims for equal pay uponthe whole of the industrial wage structure might well be to set on foot a new wageclaim cycle as it is unlikely that the majority of trade union members would be content to relinquish the present male wage advantage. An increase in purchasingpower for the female part of the industrial community would in present circum-..stances lead to a relative reduction in the men&apos;s purchasing power which would notbe tolerated by the rank and file of trade union members.
