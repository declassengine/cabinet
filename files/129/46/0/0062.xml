W r/ document IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC majesty&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET*5CP. (51) 212 COPY NO._t)20TH JULY, 1951CABINETPERSIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign AffairsThe Chiefs of Staff have now come to the conclusion, on theadvice of the Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East Forces, that, once themeasures now being undertaken in preparation for Operation &quot;BUCCANEER&quot;,including the flying-in of three battalions of troops to Shaiba, have beencompleted, it would be feasible at short notice to occupy and hold Abadanagainst any opposition which the Persians unaided would be likely to be ableto mount.2. It has hitherto been assumed that such an operation, apart fromthe political objections referred to below, would not be justifiable except asa result of extensive preparations spread over several weeks.   In view of thisrevised military opinion, coupled with the continued Persian intransigence,the probable failure of Karriman&apos;s mission, and the interim findings of theHague Court, Ministers may wish to re-examine as soon as possible all the implications of carrying out an operation designed not merely to protect british lives if in danger but to hold and operate the refinery, if necessary on imported crude.   It is not possible to forecast the exact circumstances in which the operation might be contemplated, but one obvious possibilityis that it should be carried out if and when the Persian authorities announce their intention of occupying the refinery.3. Such an operation would have obvious advantages.(a)   It would enable the refinery to be kept in at least partial production,the crude being brought from Kuwait or elsewhere, and would thus ensure the continued flow of at least a large proportionof the refined products .to the United Kingdom and other normalmarkets.(b) It would demonstrate once and for all to the Persians British deter-mination not to allow the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (A. I. O, C*) tobe evicted from Persia, and might well result in the downfallof the Mussadiq regime and its replacement by more reasonableelements prepared to negotiate a settlement.(c) It might be expected to produce a salutary effect throughout theMiddle East and elsewhere, as evidence that United kingdom interests could not be recklessly molested with impunity.Indeed, failure to exhibit firmness in this matter may prejudice our interests throughout the Middle East.(d) Finally, it should be warmly welcomed by those sections of publicopinion in this country which have been criticising His Majesty&apos;governments attitude over Persia as having hitherto been undulyweak
The objections may be summarised as follows:-(a) United Nations.    Dr. Mussadiq&apos;s Government, if they did not fallas a result of the operation, might be expected to appealimmediately to the Security Council on the grounds that theUnited Kingdom had indulged in &quot;aggression&quot; againstPersia.   Having regard to the terms of the United nations charter, a majority might be found for a resolution enjoiningus to remove our troops forthwith.   In this event His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be obliged either to comply or to use theveto  (a course theyhave never hitherto adopted).On the other hand I am advised that it might be possible to sustain acase in International Law on the following lines:   the Nationali-sation Laws which the Persians are endeavouring to implementare in our view illegal.      The Persian attempt to implementthem has led to a highly inflammatory situation in whichirreparable damage might be done to the Company&apos;s property andthe lives of the British staff endangered.   In such cases thereis nothing in International Law or in the United Nations Charterwhich necessarily prevents a State from taking its requisiteprotective action to preserve life and to prevent irreparableinjury to its interests.(b) United States.    The State Department have hitherto indicated that theywould oppose the introduction of British troops into Persiaexcept to protect British lives or in the event of russian aggression or a Communist coup d&apos;etat.It is, however, conceivable that their attitude might be modified if mr. Harriman failed completely, especially in view of dr. Mussadiq&apos;s flouting of the Hague Courfs interim decision.(c) The Commonwealth.    It seems possible that new Commonwealth countriesat least would not support such action on our part, and thesupport of all the old Commonwealth countries cannot be assumed.Much would, however, depend on how the case could be presented inour public statements and publicity, especially as regards theinternational legal issues referred to above.(d) Russia.      While over-rnuch weight need not be attached to the argument that Russia could invoke the 1921 PerscRussian Treaty to intro-duce troops into Persia if we did so, the possibility cannot be excluded that Russia would take such action on this or anotherpretext.   Whether or not she would do so seems likely to dependon whether she is prepared to contemplate a global war at this juncture.   The risk of the Russians occupying Northern Persiamight be worth accepting provided that we retained full controlof the Abadan refinery.(e) Persia.       It is arguable that Dr. Mussadiq&apos;s downfall is only a matterof time, in view of the harm to Persian economy and the alienationof world opinion which his policy has already caused;  and thatfor us to introduce troops into Persia in order to protect therefineries might merely stiffen the nationalist elements andrender more remote the chances of a more reasonable regimereplacing his.   It is also conceivable that these elements mightbe able by intimidation to prevent the Persian labour force inAbadan from working for the Company.
5. The opinions of H.M. Representatives in the countries concerned on the various factors outlined above is being sought, and ministers may wish to take these into consideration before reaching a final decision.Meanwhile it would seem desirable that, should it be necessary to executeoperation &quot;BUCCANEER&quot; for the purpose of protecting British lives, HisMajesty&apos;s Government should not commit themselves publicly to with-drawing their forces, in case circumstances might make it desirable toretain them in order to ensure the operation of the refinery.H.M.Foreign Office, S. W. 1. ,20TH JULY, 1951.(f)  The Middle East.   It is also arguable that our use of forcemight produce violent nationalist reactions in the other oilproducing countries in the Middle East.   These countries are,however, all Arab, and the Arabs have little respect for the persians.   It seems, therefore, more likely that, while someebullition of nationalist sentiment may be anticipated at first,the Arab peoples would be more lately to respect this displayof determination on our part, and that they might therefore be deterred from taking action similar to Dr. Mussadiq&apos;s against british oil interests in their countries.   In particular thepresent Iraq Government, which seems anxious to sign a revised agreement with the Iraq Petroleum Company but hasobviously been waiting on the outcome of events in Persia,might be encouraged to do so.
