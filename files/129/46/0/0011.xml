-     75THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY  OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  June 1951.CONFIDENTIAL . Copy No.     31CP. (51) 161Uth June, 1951CABINETBROADCASTS BY MINISTERS OVER FOREIGN WIRELESS SYSTEMSNote by the Prime minister in paragraph 44 of CP. (49) 95, I suggested certain rules for the guidance ofmy colleagues who might wish to broadcast. I should like to add to what is said there in order to cover the case of broadcasts by Ministers over foreign wirelesssystems.2. It is important that the British point of view should be made known bothin the United States and in other countries overseas; and broadcasting both by sound and by television is a useful instrument for this purpose. At the same time before ministers commit themselves to making broadcasts over foreign wireless systems Ishould wish to have an opportunity of considering, in consultation with the foreign secretary, whether the invitation to broadcast should be accepted and, if so, whatis to be said.3. I should be grateful therefore if my colleagues would consult me about any broadcasts of this kind which they propose to make after first seeking theadvice of the Foreign Secretary and of any other Minister who may be concernedwith the subject of the broadcast.4. If Ministers are invited to broadcast during a visit to another country, theyshould seek the advice of His Majesty&apos;s Representative in that country.C. R. A.10, Downing Street, S.W.1,13th June, 1951.40735
