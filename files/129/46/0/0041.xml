(5i) 191 1 ]B/&apos;5th July, 1951.     -CABINETCONTROL OF THE SALE OF RENTED HOUSESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland i seek the agreement of my colleagues to the preparation of a short Bill toprovide for the control of the sale of certain small rented houses falling vacant inScotland. I have already submitted a paper (L.P. (51) 38) to the Lord presidents committee on this subject and it is at the suggestion of that Committee and in thelight of their discussion that I now submit this paper to the Cabinet.2. In recent years, there has been an increasing tendency on the part oflandlords to sell such houses at the present inflated prices instead of reletting them.In the industrial west generally and particularly in Glasgow this practice is become-ing common. For example, in a recent twelve months&apos; period, about 1,400 houses in Glasgow alone with rents not exceeding  35 a year were sold with vacantpossession; it is estimated that about 1,000 of these houses had previously been occupied by tenants.3. This trend is causing considerable concern among Scottish back benchers,local authorities and other bodies. The type of house most commonly affectedis the small house of one, two or three apartments forming part of a tenementblock. Very often the houses are in poor condition without separate sanitationand water supplies. Yet working class families are being charged as much as 350 or  400-an exorbitant price for such houses. The situation is aggravatedbecause normally the houses for which such exorbitant figures are asked are freedmainly through local authorities&apos; rehousing.4. A particularly unsatisfactory feature is that speculators are known to bebuying up occupied sub-standard blocks with the object of selling individualdwellings in them at a substantial profit as they fall vacant.5. But the trouble does not end there. Many of the purchasers do notrealise all that is involved in house ownership and learn too late that in purchasinga house they have assumed heavier obligations than they had bargained for.These include liability for owners&apos; rates, and in the case of a dwelling forming partof a tenement block, mutual obligations for the repair and maintenance of the roof, gable walls, &amp;c.6. With the purchase of every house, the pool of houses available for lettingis diminished. This is serious enough at a time when capital investment restrictionsare hampering the building of houses for normal letting; it would be still more seriousif it were allowed to develop to such an extent as to become a deterrent to the mobility of labour.  -7. The Scottish Parliamentary Labour Group, the Glasgow Trades Counciland the Association of County Councils in Scotland have for some time been pressing for action to be taken to stop this exploitation of the present housingshortages. Short of legislation, I have considered various alternatives with thisobject in view, but so far no satisfactory solution has been found. In particular,we have used requisitioning powers under Defence Regulation 51. Apart, how-ever, from the fact that this method commits the Exchequer to substantial40859
expenditure, it has not proved an effective means of controlling the sale of working-class houses as experienced owners and agents have found means of forestallingor circumventing the requisitioning notices.^ 8. I accordingly seek authority to prepare a short Bill which would: providewithout reservation that all houses occupied on a tenancy basis and-let at a rentalnot exceeding  30 a year should not, on becoming unoccupied, be sold without,theconsent of the local housing authority. This maximum rental would, I think,cover most houses of the type that should be subject to selling control, but would generally exclude the more substantial type of dwelling where, even although ithas been tenanted, the owner might reasonably contemplate selling it on itsbecoming vacant or at his convenience.9. I have discussed the problem with the Minister of Local Government and planning who agrees that the. position in England and Wales differs materially fromthat in Scotland and is considering whether any comparable legislation should beprepared for England and Wales.10. For the convenience of my colleagues I attach a note explaining certaindifferences in the Scottish and English systems of rating and land tenure.H. McN.Scottish Office, SWA,5th July, 1951.APPENDIXDIFFERENCES IN THE SCOTTISH AND ENGLISH SYSTEMS OFRATING AND LAND TENUREThe following information may be of assistance to my colleagues:  (a) In England the value of a house for rating purposes is determined by theappropriate rating authority and rates are payable on the value so determined. This value may be and usually is less than the actual rentpaid by the tenant. In Scotland on the other hand the rateable value is the rent at which the house may be expected to be let, taking oneyear with another. Any increase in the rent would involve an increasein the rateable value;(b) rates in England are wholly payable by the tenant whereas in Scotlandrates are payable partly by the owner and partly by the tenant;(c) the freehold system of land tenure is rare in Scotland.  Land is usuallyheld subject to the payment of an annual fee in perpetuity, known asa feu duty;(d) the Scottish &quot; tenement&quot; consists of a block of flats of three or morestoreys, containing at least six separate dwellings entered from acommon stair. The individual dwellings normally consist of one, twoor three apartments. Frequently w.c.s &amp;c. are shared by four, sixor eight families and sometimes by many more;(e) the owners of houses in such tenements are under obligation to meet theirdue share of any charges for the repair and maintenance of those partsof the building which are common to the tenement as a whole, e.g., the roof, gable walls and stairs. Each owner is also liable for the upkeepof his own property and for the proportion of the feu-duty allocatedagainst it. *
