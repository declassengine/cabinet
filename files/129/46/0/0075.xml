(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAjESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential cp. (51) 22524TH JULY, 1951CABINETCOPY NO.    3 iMIGRATION POLICY:  ASSISTED PASSAGEAGREEMENT WITH AUSTRALIAMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and national ServiceMy colleagues will be aware from earlier papers, in particularC.P, (50) 320, that my Department has, all along, been opposed to thetermination of this Agreement.2. Accordingly, I welcome in principle the revised recommendationof the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations contained in cp. (51) 218 that the Agreement should be continued for a further period.I do not, however, agree with all the details of his proposal.3. The proposed ceiling of  150,000 a year net ( 250,000 less the expected contribution of  100,000 from the Australian Government) might,I fear, be regarded as   derisory in itself.   Moreover, we have alreadyspent nearly  250,000 this financial year in the three months since 1st April;   so that on the basis proposed we shall be able to make no further contribution during the present financial year.   This must weaken our control over the administration of the scheme to which the Secretary ofState, as well as I, attach great importance,4. In the second place, I hope that we shall not commit ourselves to a statement that this extension is final and that the Empire SettlementActs will be terminated in May, 1954.   To make such an announcement nowcan only give colour to a belief that our association with the Commonwealthis no longer of value to us and this in turn can only do harm.   Moreover,there is no justification for making such a statement.   There is no evidence that the other Commonwealth countries will seek financialassistance from us;  they have not done so hitherto.   But even if they did,some assistance might well be a small price to pay for on the one handensuring the continued strengthening of the British connection and on theother our being in a position to exercise a measure of control over thenumbers and type of persons emigrating.5. The Secretary of State proposes that we should be authorised&quot;to inform other Commonwealth Governments, c.g. the Canadian Govern-ment, which recruit emigrants from this country, that in future we shallexpect the activities of their immigration authorities here to be subject tothe same system of control by the Ministry of Labour as that which exists in the case of the Australians&quot;.   Naturally, I should welcome the sameco-operation in this matter from the other Commonwealth comitries as I havereceived from Australia.   But to talk in such terms as I have quoted isunrealistic.   The system of control which my Department exercises inrelation to emigration to Australia is built entirely and at every stageon the joint administration of the Agreement.   Without such an arrangementwe are dependent upon the goodwill of the Governments concerned unless
we are prepared to take steps to prevent the emigration to commonwealth countries of particular persons or classes of persons.   Are we?   I should prefer to try and build up a state of goodwill and co-operation with theCommonwealth immigration authorities.6. Finally, I must again register my strong dissent from the description of the assisted migration policy as &quot;the distasteful anachronismof paying our people to emigrate&quot;.   I would remind my colleagues that the Agreement was signed in 1946, by a Labour Government , after alapse of years and after full consideration, at a time when the need, on social, economic and, I would urge, strategic grounds, for the greatersolidarity of the British people throughout the Commonwealth v/as no morepressing than it is today.   The Assisted Passage scheme has never, in thepublic mind, been regarded as a form of bribe paid to remittance men to berid of them.   That was certainly not the intention of the scheme in 1946,nor is it today.   It is a practical token of our desire that those who wish todo so should have a chance of advancement within the Commonwealth andso maintain the British connection in a society of nations from, which thiscountry derives much of its practical influence in the affairs of the world.The repetition of this phrase can only cause resentment here and inAustralia and not least among these - some of the best of our stock -who have availed themselves of the provisions of the scheme.   Moreover,to put it at its lowest, it is no tribute to ourselves so to describe one of ourmore broadly conceived policies.7. To sum up -(1)   I welcome the Secretary of State&apos;s proposal to extend the assisted passage Agreement.(2)   I think the annual ceiling should be  500,000 net as againstthe  150,000 net proposed by the Secretary of State.(3)   I do not think we should announce now that the Agreement and theEmpire Settlement Acts will finally come to an end in May, 1954.We should keep an open mind on this.(4)  I agree that the extension of the Agreement with Australia should be conditional on the continuation of the existing control of australian emigration by my Department during the currency ofthe extended Agreement.(5)   I should welcome the same co-operation from the other Common-wealth authorities in the matter of controlling emigration fromthis country as I now receive from Australia.   But I should prefer to try to effect this co-operation on the basis of goodwill ratherthan by attempting to impose our will on them.A.R.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S. W. 1.,24TH JULY, 1951.
