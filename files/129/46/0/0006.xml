INTERNATIONAL, WHEAT AGREEMENT:ACCESSION OF Japan Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Minister of food at its meeting on the 13th June, 1951, the International wheat council, the body established to administer the International Wheat Agree-ment, will consider a further application for Japanese membership of theAgreement.    A note setting out the previous history of this question,prepared by officials of the Ministry of Food in consultation with officials of the other Departments concerned, is annexed.2. At previous sessions of the International Wheat Council HisMajesty&apos;s Government have refused to agree to the accession of Japan tothe International Wheat Agreement unless the Supreme Commander AlliedPowers (S.C.A.P.) gave an undertaking on behalf of Japan not to buy thenon-dollar wheat already covered by the Agreement.    Our reasons were that Japan&apos;s unconditional accession would have reduced the amount of australian wheat available to the United Kingdom and have helped to main-tain the world price of wheat at a time when there was a distinct possibility that if we played our hand wisely we might be able to bring about some reduction.3. Although the Federal Republic of Germany and Spain, whenapplying for membership, gave the undertaking we required, S.C.A.P.refused to do so and the Japanese application for unconditional accessionwas rejected as a result last June.    Our attitude in the Council was extremely unpopular, particularly with the United States, Canada and australia, who regarded it as running counter to the multilateral principles on which the Agreement was based.    Representations were made toSir Oliver Franks by Mr. Acheson.4. Subsequently we have found it increasingly difficult to enlistS.C.A.P.&apos;s co-operation on rice problems in the Far East and we have beenrepeatedly advised by the Commissioner General&apos;s Organisation in singapore-pore that a gesture to S.C.A.P. on wheat would secure a valuable degree ofco-operation on rice.5. The United States Government have now again sponsored a japanese application for accession and have asked for His Majesty&apos;governments support of it.6. Of the two original United Kingdom reasons for opposing uncon-ditional Japanese accession on the last occasion, the second - the possi-bility of a fall in world wheat prices before the expiry of the Agreement(in mid-1953) - has for practical purposes disappeared.

of increased dollar expenditure is still relevant and it remains to weighsuch a possible increase against the serious political effects of continuingour opposition to Japan&apos;s unconditional accession.7. The recurrence of public disagreement on this issue is undesirable, particularly at this moment in view of discussions on thePeace Treaty, at which the question of Japan&apos;s accession to international bodies is sure to be raised, and of the negotiations for a new payments agreement between Japan and the sterling area.    Any improvement inthe atmosphere in which these difficult negotiations are to take place would be welcome.    There is moreover a specific economic reason for supporting japan s unconditional accession in that we need the maximumdegree of co-operation in the distribution of rice supplies in South east asia.8. The additional dollar expenditure in which the United kingdom might be involved could scarcely exceed $12 to $20 millions.    Althoughthe prospects for our dollar balance of payment in the medium term areat present somewhat gloomy, this does not seem a large sum in compari-son with the damage that may be done to our already rather difficultrelations with the United States in the Far East if we are again to take theinitiative and remain almost alone in opposing Japan&apos;s accession.    indeed it could be argued that the ill-will we should earn by such opposition mightwell in the long run lose us more than a sum of this order of magnitude.9. Last June we secured the rejection of Japan&apos;s application by theuse of our weighted vote and in spite of high level representations fromthe United States.    The changed distribution of votes since then makes itunsafe to assume that we can do this again.10. If we are to obtain the maximum benefit from supporting theJapanese application or indeed if we are to avoid the maximum disadvantage of refusing to do so, it is essential to inform the United States Administra-tion of our decision without delay since the meeting of the international wheat Council opens on 13th June.11. Recommendation.    In view of the foregoing considerations, werecommend to our colleagues:-(i)     that His Majesty&apos;s Government should agree to support Japaneseapplication for unconditional accession to the International wheat agreement;(ii)     that the United States Administration should be informed of our decision without delay;(iii)     that,as a consequence of (i) above, the Federal Republic ofGermany and Spain should be released from the undertakingsthey have given.    The estimate of the increased dollarliability made at paragraph 8 above makes allowance for thisrelease.H.M.M.W.8th June, 1951.
ANNEXAt its meeting on 25th November, 1949 vE.PiC.(4-9) 47th Meeting,Minute 2) the Economic Policy Committee considered a recommendation that the United Kingdom should refuse consent to the admission of Germanyand Japan to the International, Wheat Agreement until and unless Argentinaand Russia were admitted, but following approaches in Buenos Aires and moscow it became clear that neither of these countries were willing toparticipate.2. The Committee further considered the accession of Germany and japan to the International Wheat Agreement at its meeting on 5th January,1950 (E.P.C.(50) 1st Meeting).    The non-participation of the U.S.S.R. andthe Argentine meant that if Germany and Japan were to be permitted to accede, practically every importing country in the world would beincluded, while supplies would be obtainable from only three of thefive major exporting countries, i. e. Canada, the United States and australia.    The Committee then decided that the International wheat council should be informed that we would be prepared to agree to the accession of Germany and Japan only if this would not adversely affect our position.    This could be done by limiting the extent to which thesecountries could purchase wheat from Australia under the Agreement; theCouncil was therefore informed that the United Kingdom could agree onlyto conditional terms of accession, i. e. that the availability of non-dollarwheat should be limited to the quantity by which the guaranteed sales ofAustralia and France were increased as a result of the accessions.    Inthe event, Germany accepted these terms but Japan did not.    Spain sub-sequently acceded to the Agreement under virtually the same conditionsas Germany.3. The Supreme Commander Allied Powers has now informed theInternational Wheat Council that Japan will re-apply for accession withoutconditions attached at the meeting of the Council which will be held inLrondon starting on 13th June, and the State Department have asked our embassy in Washington for an assurance, in advance of the meeting of theCouncil, that His Majesty&apos;s Government will support the application.    TheUnited States have advanced a number of reasons why our former attitudeshould now be modified.    The most cogent are:-(a) that the question of Japan&apos;s accession to the international wheat Agreement is bound to arise in discussion of a peace treaty with Japan;(b) that the sterling area dollar position has eased.4. The question at (a) has not yet arisen, but the Americans arecertain to attach importance to the admission of Japan to any organisation which would tend to re-establish her in the comity of nations.    Regarding(b), Departments have reluctantly been forced to the conclusion that the improvements in this field which occurred during 1950 are unlikely tocontinue during the next year or two and that our dollar position willprobably deteriorate.    It remains, therefore, to be decided:-(a) whether the conservation of dollars is the overriding factor - inwhich case we should do nothing which might deprive the sterling area of non-dollar wheat, however, small the amount;  ox(b) whether there are considerations in the wider field of diplomatic,financial and trade relations which outweigh the risk of additionaldollar expenditure.
In the following paragraphs we have endeavoured to review the considera-tions for and against the unconditional accession of Japan.5. The main points made when this question was last considered by ministers were:-(a) That Germany&apos;s and Japan&apos;s accession without the balancingaccession of the large non-dollar wheat exporting countries atpresent outside the Agreement would substantially strengthen the hands of the dollar wheat exporters in their efforts tomaintain prices at or near the maximum permitted under the- Agreement.(b) That our ability to solve our main national problem, that of our dollar balance, hinged as much on the issue of wheat prices andavailability of non-dollar supplies as on any other single factor.It can now be said that, despite every endeavour by us, the exporting countries under the Agreement have been able to keep prices at or onlyfractionally below the permitted maximum, although by the mid-summer of1950 there were indications that if production in North America reachedexpectations Canada would be forced to reduce her price.    Canada hadalready reached the stage when she was offering &quot;free&apos;market wheat at approximately the same price as wheat under the International wheat agreement.6. Unfortunately, the position quickly changed.    Early frosts in thePrairie Provinces damaged a large part of her crop and seriously reduced the quantity of millable wheat available.    Events in Korea stimulatedbuying by importing countries, while the loss of about 6 million tons offoodgrains in India resulted in a wholly unforeseen demand on the worldexportable surplus.    This- combination of events resulted in &quot;free&quot;market wheat rising to upwards of $2. 50 per bushel while member countries applied to the Wheat Council for increases in their guaranteedpurchases amounting to about 1. 75 million tons.    Of this amount theUnited States found half a million tons for India, while Australia increasedher guaranteed sales to provide 30,000 tons for Ceylon,    All other appli-cations were refused.    The result has been that not only have prices been maintained at the maximum but forward contracts for the third crop year1951/52 have been entered into at the maximum.    Moreover, all present indications are that the sellers are likely to be able to obtain this priceduring 1952/53, the fourth and last year of the Agreement.7. If, as seems likely, the world demand for wheat is maintained ataround present levels the dependence of the importing countries of theworld on the United States will become even more apparent.    Australianproduction cannot be increased to any significant extent, while even ifCanada harvests a good crop this year, she is unlikely to have any substan-tial surplus for sale in the &quot;free&quot; market.    Fortunately it is the present policy of the United States to keep her wheat production at a high level,but even if she has a large exportable surplus in 1951/52, this will beregarded as a strategic reserve and not an embarrassing surplus and willnot be permitted to influence world prices in a downwards direction.This being so, the accession of Japan conditionally or otherwise wouldnot materially alter the price position.during the currency of the existing agreement.
8. If Japan is permitted to accede without conditions excluding her from or restricting her access to the Australian market, the German and spanish Governments will have to be released from their undertakings.(This would mean the addition of about 2.4 million tons to the potentialdemand for Australian wheat which at present represents less than 15per cent of the total quantity covered by the Wheat Agreement.)    If,however, it is accepted that prices will remain at the maximum duringthe remaining period of the Agreement, and we are prepared to pay that price, neither Germany nor Japan can offer Australia any better terms.9. While it is reasonable to assume that Australia would not willinglylose her market in the United Kingdom it is by no means certain - in the short term at any rate - that we can be sure of obtaining what we would regard as a reasonable share of her International Wheat Agreementexports, i. e. about 40 million bushels (1. 07 million tons), of which 13million bushels (0. 35 million tons) would be for the Colonies who look toAustralia for their suppplies and about 27 million bushels (. 72 million tons)for the United Kingdom.    With this end in view approaches have recentlybeen made to the Australian Wheat Board, but so far without result.Australia&apos;s total guaranteed sales under the International Wheat Agreementamount only to 88. 7 million bushels (2. 38 million tons) and any substantialsales to Germany or Japan would be bound to result in increased dollarpurchases by the Commonwealth as a whole, unless the amount sold by australia to Germany and Japan could be replaced by Commonwealthpurchases from Russia, Argentina, or other non-dollar suppliers.    Thereis the further consideration that once she is a member of the international wheat Agreement, Japan would automatically participate in the event of anew Agreement being negotiated.10. Reference was made in E.P.C.(50) 3 to the possibility of permittingGermany and Japan to accede on the understanding that they secured thewhole of their requirements for the crop years 1949/50 and 1950/51 fromthe United States.    This has, in fact, been the source of most of theirimported wheat, but in the case of Japan she has had to buy in the open market which has cost about $2. 50 instead of $1. 80 per bushel.    It is forthis reason that Japan wishes to accede and that the Japanese Governmentwould, it is understood, do so even if they were denied access to Australiansupplies.    For the time being it would seem the Japanese have relativelymore adequate supplies of dollars than of sterling;  in the long run, ofcourse, her dollar position will almost certainly be worse than her sterlingposition.    General MacArthur as the Supreme Allied Commander was,however, of the opinion that to offer conditional terms of accession was to treat Japan as a colony and he was not prepared to allow Japan to accept.11. The fact that the Supreme Allied Commander saw fit to mate theissue one of prestige has, however, had repercussions in the Far East,particularly in connection with Japan&apos;s purchases of rice.    Prior to thewar her sources of supply for rice were Formosa and Korea, but she isnow a competitor for Siamese and Burmese supplies, where she occupiesan advantageous position since she is willing to pay prices which are com-petitive with those offered by the United Kingdom dependent territories inSouth East Asia and is also able to offer, in particular to the Siamese, thegoods which they need in exchange.    Her intervention has not only increased the price of rice but has pre-empted supplies which would otherwise havebeen available to the British Colonies in the Far East.    This, general macarthur contended, was the inevitable result of denying Japan access to the International Wheat Agreement wheat, and there is some substance in the American view that if she, Japan, were admitted to the international wheat Agreement she could buy more wheat for the same expenditure of
dollars and would, therefore, need less rice.    Japan will in any eventcontinue to buy rice from Burma and Siam in the foreseeable future, buther accession to the International Wheat Agreement might moderate herdemands for rice from the traditional sources of supply of the British andother rice deficit territories in South East Asia.12. At a recent meeting of the Rice Consultative Committee in singapore it was stated on behalf of the Supreme Commander AlliedPowers that Japan was not a country with a rice requirement, but a country with a food requirement, so that if it were made more advantageousfor Japan to take wheat instead of rice in exchange for her goods, she would do so.    The effect of Japan&apos;s rice purchases has converted a more or lesssufficient supply from the traditional sources into a deficit of possibly500,000 tons and the creation of an overall deficit puts the rice exporting countries in a position of power which they are very ready to abuse.13. The United States Administration has decided to support Japan&apos;application for membership of the International Wheat Council provided the quota applied for does not exceed 18. 6 million bushels (500,000 tons); theUnited States, either alone or jointly with other exporters, will increasethe export quota sufficiently to match a Japanese import quota of 18. million bushels.    We understand that the Canadians would also support anapplication by Japan, but they could in no circumstances increase their export commitment above the total of 235 million bushels and this wouldmean that little or nothing would be available to meet applications bymember countries for additional import quotas.    We have also beeninformed by the United States Administration that failure of Japan to accedewould not mean that an additional export quota would be made available tomeet applications for additional import quotas of existing member-countries.14. When Japan&apos;s application is considered by the International wheat council at its June meeting it is reasonably certain that it will be supportedby Australia as well as Canada.    There may be some opposition from thoseimporting countries who have asked for increased quotas and have been refused, but this is by no means certain, and if Japan&apos;s accession is to be effectively opposed we are likely to be left to take the initiative.    Last Junewe secured the rejection of Japan&apos;s application by the use of our weightedvote in the face of overwhelming numerical opposition and despite high-level representations from the United States.    Since then, however, as theresult of the accession of Germany and Spain and other changes in the dis-tribution of votes, our voting power has diminished and if we decided again to lead the opposition to an application from Japan it cannot be assumed that we should again get sufficient support to ensure the rejection of theapplication,15. If, however, we do prevent Japan&apos;s accession, we shall certainly not have contributed to any greater amity in our Anglo-American relation-ships.    This is particularly important at the moment in Japan, wherefinancial negotiations with S.C.A.P. are about to open.    The United Kingdomaim in these negotiations is to replace the present overall Payments Agree-ment which embodies a convertibility arrangement and consequentlynecessitates the balancing of trade between S.C.A.P. and the sterling area,with a Sterling Payments Agreement, having no convertibility provision.The advantages of such an agreement, in increasing the level of trade and theuse of sterling, are obvious; and the impression of the Treasury representa-tive in Tokyo is that United Kingdom support of the Japanese applicationwould be very helpful in improving the atmosphere in which these difficult negotiations are to take place.    Conversely, a refusal would react adverselyupon the American negotiators, who will certainly not be over-anxious toencourage the strength of sterling against the dollar.
