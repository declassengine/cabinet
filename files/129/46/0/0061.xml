(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (51) 21119TH JULY, 1951COPY NO. 61CABINETBRITISH SUGAR CORPORATION bill memorandum by the Minister of FoodMy colleagues will recall that when they considered my original proposal in October of last year to bring the British Sugar Corporation Ltd.into public ownership, it was thought that provision should be made in thelegislation for the revision of the existing Sugar Refining Agreement(CM. (50) 67th Conclusions, Minute 6, and 68th Conclusions, Minute 3).My subsequent recommendation which was accepted by the Committee onSocialisation of Industries in February, was that, although the existing agreement should be allowed to remain in force, I should take powers in thelegislation to determine it and to impose new arrangements by order indefault of any voluntary agreement (S.I. (M)(5l) 3rd Meeting, Minute 3).2. The general effect of the Agreement and the present position inregard to it were described in paragraphs 16 - 18 of S.I. (M)(51) 10;  these paragraphs are reproduced in the Appendix to this memorandum.   the relevant points are (i) that the Agreement protected the Corporation againstunregulated competition from the refiners, and (ii) that in view of the control exercised by my Department, the current situation is satisfactory and thereare no compelling reasons why a new Agreement should be devised now.3. The drafting of the British Sugar Corporation Bill has now beencompleted subject to decisions on two points with which the Chancellor of theExchequer is dealing.   A serious difficulty of principle has, however,arisen in relation to the proposed clause dealing with the Sugar RefiningAgreement.   After having the benefit of the advice of the Lord chancellor and the Attorney-General, I have reached the conclusion that it is not desirable to proceed with the proposal to take powers in this Bill to determine the current Agreement for the reasons set out below.4. Powers to vary the Agreement must, if they are to be of any value,confer complete freedom on the Government to decide what variations are desirable.   Thus in theory at all events, the Government would be able toreduce the refiners1 share of the sugar market so drastically that they couldnot operate their business successfully.   Any clause conferring upon theGovernment power to modify an agreement to the detriment of the refinerswithout their consent would naturally meet with strong resistance.   TheLord Chancellor and the Attorney-General have given me their opinion thatthe proposed powers would involve such a potential interference with private interests that the circumstances in which, and the purposes for which, these powers would be exercised, ought to be clearly stated at the time they aresought.5. It might therefore be possible to commend the clause to the Houseif I were able now to state in detail when and how the powers would be used and the extent to which I would propose to vary the Agreement.    But this is what I cannot do, since it is not possible to determine the scope and nature ofa. poR-sihle rov-JRod Agfocmcnt without knowing more clearly than we do today
SIwhat our policy is going to be on a number of longer-term issues inconnection with sugar, e. g. whether Government is to remain the soleimporter of sugar, whether price control down to the retail stage is tocontinue, to what extent control is to be exercised in the longer-termover the refiners, and so on.   These matters are all being sttidied, butthey involve complex issues, including Commonwealth and international trade considerations, and I think it would be wrong to attempt to reach ahasty decision on them now for the purpose of this Bill.   It seems to me tobe more advantageous to keep the issue of long-term sugar policy quitedistinct from the question of the introduction of public ownership over theBritish Sugar Corporation Ltd.6. The omission of these powers from the Bill will in no wayinvalidate our immediate purpose, namely, to transfer the corporation to public ownership;  nor will it prejudice the current day-to-dayoperations of the Corporation.   Moreover, with the experience gained of full control of the Corporation^ affairs, we shall be in a better position at a later date to deal with the Refining Agreement issue than we are today.The omission of powers of interference with the Agreement will sensiblynarrow the field of controversy about the Bill.   It will also avoid the difficult problem of the compensation provisions which, I am advised,would be necessary to cover the event of the Government determining theAgreement, provisions which would be difficult to frame in advance ofany precise knowledge of the circumstances in which they are to be applied.7. If my colleagues accept my advice on this issue, I would commendthe Bill to the House as a straight-forward measure which would remove theanomaly of private non risk-bearing capital in the British Sugar CorporationLtd, , and at the same time place on a permanent basis the legislation relating to the beet sugar industry.   If the issue of the Refining agreement is raised, I would explain that on transfer of its shares to public ownership,the Corporation will naturally remain a party to the Agreement in its existing form.   I would add that it would be open to the Corporation eitherto negotiate with the refiners some modification of that Agreement, if that were considered desirable during its currency:   or, when the currentAgreement expires one year after I have certified sugar &quot;control&quot; to haveended, to replace it by some other agreed arrangement.8. I therefore recommend to my colleagues that the British sugar corporation Bill, which is now to be introduced in the 1951/52Session, should make no provision for the determination of the existingSugar Refining Agreement.M.

appendix the SUGAR REFINING AGREEMENT,/Extraet from memo randum S. I. (M) (51) 10,dated 1st February, 1951/&quot;16. The principal effects of the Agreement in the statu-tory and policy context in which it was made were as follows.The Corporation acquired from the Agreement the right to sellup to a quota of 500,000 tons of refined sugar, and. to theextent that it was unable to do so, to receive 1s.4!-d per cwt.for any part of its quota sold to the refiners, and a guaran-teed market for about three-fifths of its output in the formof raw sugar.     The Corporation also received&quot; under the Agree-ment an annual subsidy from the refiners of about  300,000 inconsideration of selling to the refiners &quot;notional auota&quot; rights to refine 220,000 tons of sugar in addition to its actual auotaof 500,000 tons.      The refiners, on the other hand, in makingthe Agreement conceding these advantages to the Corporation, hadbeen assured by the Government of the maintenance of excise duties on refined beet sugar and of the penal Customs duties on imported refined sugar, a safeguard which enabled Tate andLyle to consolidate their &quot;monopoly&quot; of sugar refining.     Therefiners also benefited from the licensing provisions of the1936 Act which discouraged the entry of new refiners into theindustry;    for example, the Co-operative Wholesale Societywere unable to start sugar refining as they are believed tohave wished to do.      Moreover, the Corporation were bound bythe Agreement itself to produce only granulated sugar and none of the profitable specialities produced by the refiners, suchas cube and icing sugar or syrup.      Finally, the Treasuryachieved by means of the Agreement a barrier to che Corporationcompeting with the refiners at the Exchequer&apos;s expense and a means by which the refiners contributed to the subsidies tothe Corporation.17. In short, the Agreement gave vital protection tothe Corporation as a sugar refiner against unregulated compe-tition by the refiners of imported cane sugar, which it wasinherently incapable of meeting except at the Exchequersexpense;    confirmed and stabilised the position of therefiners, and of Tate and Lyle in particular, as a State-protected monopoly;    and protected the Treasury and the tax-payer against having to finance a sugar war between theCorporation and the Refiners.      It is important that mycolleagues should appreciate that the Agreement, thoughindirectly conferring advantages on the refiners, was neverin any sense essential to their operations as it was to theCorporation.18. It is clear that if there is to be a return to con-ditions under which the Corporation is required to compete with the privately-owned refineries in the refined sugar market,some arrangement for the division of the market will be essen-tial if the Corporation is to survive as a sugar refinerwithout extravagant expenditure of public funds.     though there are clauses in the present Agreement that v/ould beobjectionable in the long term (e.g. those clauses prohibiting the Corporation from producing speciality sugars and thosecalling for fixed annual payments by the refiners to the
Corporation) it is probable that a new Agreement would not differ basically in essentials from existing arrangements.There arc. however, no compelling reasons why a new Agreementsho\xld be negotiated now but, on the contrary, what are, inmy view, cogent reasons for postponement.     The present agreement, except that it defines the Corporation^ share inthe refined sugar market, and calls for the annual paymentof  300,000 by the refiners to the Corporation, has been toall intents and purposes inoperative since the outbreak of war,and can remain so for so long as control in its present formcontinues.     The Corporation, in existing circumstances, hasa guaranteed outlet from the Ministry of Pood for all therefined sugar it is entitled to produce and is, therefore, ina much stronger position than before the war, when it was never able to sell its full quota of refined sugar in corn-petition with the refiners, even by under-cutting the price.For the next few years, therefore, its position is satis-factory, and almost certainly more secure that it would be ifthere were reversion&apos;to competition, even under conditionsrelatively favourable to the Corporation.&quot;
