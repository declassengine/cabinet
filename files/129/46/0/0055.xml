-   268IIS   DOCUMENT   IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY S   GOVERN MEN I /Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1951CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.   g -c.p.. (51) 20513th July, 1951CABINETLEASEHOLD reform memorandum by the Attorney-GeneralThe Government are pledged to introduce permanent legislation on leasehold reform within the next two years. The Leasehold Property (Temporary Provisions)Act, 1951, which we have just passed in order to hold the position meantime, ceases to have effect as at midsummer 1953. The Committee of officials engaged on pre-paring the legislation have now reported to me on the need to obtain authoritativedecisions at once on certain points. The permanent legislation will be a majorBill, full of complexities, and will have to be introduced early in the 1952-53Session. Its drafting is bound to take time, and during the process many pointswill be thrown up requiring Ministerial decisions. It is essential that parliamentary counsel should have sufficient instructions to enable him to start the task by nextOctober.2. Progress has been made with the technicalities, and on many of the policypoints I can myself give the necessary directions, subject to review later by mycolleagues. But before the structure of the Bill can be further elaborated, general guidance is required from the Cabinet on certain major points of policy. I am afraid, therefore, that I must trouble my colleagues for at least a provisionalexpression of their views before the Recess, so as to enable the work to proceedto a proper time-table.3. I must emphasise that it will not be possible merely to continue thetemporary legislation beyond its present two years life. Not only are we pledgedagainst doing so: it would also be wrong on merits (partly because it simplycontinues expiring ground leases of residential property occupied by the groundlessee at the present ground rent, which would be manifestly unfair save for a very limited period, and partly because it places a &quot; moratorium &quot; on the enforcement of repairing and other important covenants, which also cannot be allowed to con-tinue indefinitely). On the main principles of permanent reform we should take decisions now.4. The main policy point as regards residential property is whether we should concentrate on protecting the occupying tenant&apos;s right of occupation by givingsecurity of tenure after the termination of the lease, or whether we should go furherand enable him, by a scheme of leasehold enfranchisement at the tenanfs option,to acquire compulsorily the right of ownership as well as the right of occupation,thus giving him an asset which he can sell or let at rack rent when he no longerwants to occupy.5. Measures for improving security of tenure could extend to all occupyingtenants of unfurnished residential property, whether under ground leases or underoccupational rack-rent tenancies of whatever length. But no one seriously suggeststhat leasehold enfranchisement should apply to a wider field than occupying groundlessees of residential property held under a ground lease.6. This is not only a matter of complicated legal technicalities, it is of greatimportance socially and it also has considerable political implications. I therefore thought it right, though I hesitate to present my colleagues with so much reading
matter at this time, to circulate the attached print as an aid to consideration ofthe subject. It contains an objective analysis of the subject by officials in a muchmore convenient form that the contradictory reports submitted by the majority and the Minority of the Leasehold Committee. It does not, naturally, deal withall the political aspects.7. Paragraphs 3-7 summarise the main question. Paragraphs 8-28 examinethe principle of leasehold enfranchisement for occupying ground lessees only, point-ing out in particular the difficulty of deciding on the respective merits of landlord and tenant if they have bought their interests towards the end of the term. Para-graphs 29-35 deal with the awkward question of the compensation to be paid bythe tenant on exercising his power to enfranchise, concluding that the best scheme would be one which pre-supposes the enactment of measures for improving securityof tenure at the end of the term, which would reduce the value of the reversion.Paragraphs 36-39 raise the question of exceptions e.g., for Government Depart-ments, New Town Corporations and local authorities. Paragraphs 40-47 deal with proposals for improving security of tenure for all tenants of unfurnished residential property not at present protected by the Rent Acts. The questions for decision are summarised in paragraph 48.8. Broadly, the question reduces to this. The present law regarding propertyunder ground leases causes some social friction and, in the view of many, somesocial injustice. Would these evils be sufficiently remedied by giving occupyingground lessees a right of continued occupation, at a fair rent, after these leasesexpire, or is it necessary, on social and equitable grounds, to give them also a rightto purchase the freehold ownership? If the latter, ought the right to be given toall such lessees, or only to some? And ought the compensation to be purelynominal (on the view that in equity the tenant should already own the freehold), orthe full market value (on the view that the landlords rights should not be depreci-ated) or. as is suggested in the attached print, something between the two? the leasehold Committee by a majority of 8 to 2 recommended against any right ofenfranchisement. The Minority (the present Solicitor-General and Mr. Leslie Hale,M.P.) supported, on general grounds of social equity, a scheme for occupyingground lessees, with a &quot; midway &quot; compensation scheme, but subject to the exemp-tion from the scheme of certain classes of landlord, and the exclusion of tenantswho purchased their interests in the last ten years of the term.9. The permanent legislation must also include provisions dealing with busi-ness premises. This is a simpler problem (there is no question of leasehold enfranchisement) on which I need not trouble my colleagues at present. There willalso be many detailed provisions amending the present law in technical matters.10. I would add that I think it should be possible for the Bill to proceedindependently of any general amendment of the Rent Acts, thus preserving theGovernments liberty of decision in that field, though there may be difficulties onthis score.11.

secret copy No.LEASEHOLD REFORMNOTE BY A COMMITTEE OF officials. The problems to be dealt with in the permanent legislation may be roughlydivided under three heads:  I. Leasehold enfranchisement and, whether as an alternative or as an addition, improved security of tenure for residential tenants;II. Improved security of tenure for business tenants;III. Miscellaneous amendments in the law of landlord and tenant in the lightof experience of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1927.2. Head I and, to a lesser extent, Head II involve political questions of some importance, and it is not possible to work out the structure of the Bill without broadpolicy directives from the Cabinet. Head III comprises, in the main, technical and non-controversial points on which the Cabinet need not be troubled at thisstage.I. LEASEHOLD ENFRANCHISEMENT AND IMPROVED SECURITY of tenure FOR RESIDENTIAL TENANTS3. The Cabinet gave preliminary consideration to this question last autumn,when it was finally decided to introduce a temporary standstill Bill without prejudice to the Governments ultimate decision. This temporary legislation came intooperation on 24th June, 1951. It continues until 23rd June, 1953, any ground leases,expiring before that date, of houses occupied by the lessee or his family. further legislation must therefore be available by Midsummer 1953.4. The question of leasehold enfranchisement cannot usefully be consideredapart from the question of improved security of tenure for residential tenants.There are some who think that the aspirations of those who desire leasehold enfranchisement are really attached much more to the right of absolute security which enfranchisement would provide than to the right of absolute ownership;that the status of a freeholder (with the undivided legal, physical and taxationliabilities which flow from his proprietorship) is not necessarily more attractivein itself to the bulk of people in moderate circumstances than the status of a tenant;and that those aspirations would therefore be sufficiently met by measures for improving security of tenure. Some go further and suggest that if security of tenure were improved a right of leasehold enfranchisement would be only Veryrarely exercised except by the wealthier class of tenant unless, of course, it wereavailable on financial terms very favourable to the tenant.5. Others, however, while agreeing that security of tenure should be improved,feel that it would not suffice and that a desire to enjoy absolute ownership of the family home is, in the case of tenants who do not foresee having to move away fromthe locality, not only natural and laudable but also strongly and widely felt; andthey point to the great expansion between the wars of freehold ownership achieved through the medium of Building Societies.6. So far as we know, there is no conclusive evidence which would suggesthow far enfranchisement would be resorted to if security of tenure were markedlyimproved by fresh legislation; but obviously it would not be nearly as widely used as it would be if the law on security of tenure were left as it is at present. In anycase, the two subjects are closely interlocked and they are separately consideredbelow only for ease of presentation.
7. The main question the Government have to decide is whether they will proceed (as do the Rent Acts and as does the new interim Act) by protecting andprolonging the tenants right of occupation, or whether they will go further and give him also the right to acquire compulsorily the proprietorship of his house,which he can then use either for occupation or, if he prefers, for purposes of resaleor of letting at a rack-rent.(a) Leasehold Enfranchisement*8. It will be recalled that by a majority of eight to two the Leasehold Com-mittee (Cmd. 7982) recommended against any form of leasehold enfranchisementwhile the Minority Report by Mr. (as he then v/as) Ungoed-Thomas, K.C., andMr. Leslie Hale, recommended in favour of a limited scheme. In order to limit thelength of this paper, we have assumed that the Cabinet would not want to examinethe more extreme possibilities which the Minority, in common with the Majority,rejected. This means that the right of leasehold enfranchisement would not be accorded:  (a) to tenants or sub-tenants of non-residential property;(b) to tenants or sub-tenants who do not occupy but sub-let;(c) to tenants or sub-tenants on an ordinary occupational tenancy at a rackrent (i.e., normally for 21 years or less), as distinct from a ground lease.9. The Minority describe their purpose as &quot; to provide enfranchisement forthe occupying ground tenant who occupies his dwelling-house as a dwelling-house.&quot;10. The arguments for and against enfranchisement are fully traversed in theMajority and Minority reports: this note merely summarises the main points.The Principle of Enfranchisement11. Under the typical residential building lease, the tenant erects a house of a given standard and covenants to keep it in repair and deliver it up to the landlordin good condition at the end of a term of, say, 99 years, paying during that term aground rent which takes account of the fact that he has built the house, and whichtherefore is generally a low figure. The ground tenant may, and frequently does,sublet the house at a rack rent. The house is, in effect, the tenants during the currency of the lease, in the sense that he has the right (a) to occupy, or (b) to sell the right to occupy, or (c) to draw rack rent on disposing of the right to occupy byunder-lease; but under the existing law the ground landlord becomes the owner ofthe house in every sense on the termination of the lease. The tenant must theneither go elsewhere or come to new terms with the landlord, who is in a position toask either (for the sale of the freehold) the full current market value of the house and land, or (for a new lease) the full current rack rent12. One of the main reasons for advocating leasehold enfranchisement is a feeling that the typical ground lease was an unconscionable bargain because of the landlords virtual monopoly of building land. It is unfair that the landlord shouldever obtain the ownership of a house which he has done- nothing to build ormaintain. The contrary view is that the bargain was perfectly just and that the landlord has, in fact, earned an equitable as well as a legal right to ownership ofthe house by drawing, over so many years, a rent which was always low (and hasbecome, with the change in the value of money, lower still) in relation to thebenefit in return for which he draws it.13. As regards the fairness or unfairness of the typical building lease, the minority say: &quot; The credible information on the ground lease system in theindustrial areas provides abundant condemnation,&quot; and the Majority say: &quot; Atthis distance of time it is obviously impossible to adjudicate upon charges of unfairconduct on the part of the original landlords in the granting of leases 80 or 90years ago.&quot; But nothing really turns on this difference of view. For if enfranchisement-enfranchisement is advocated on the footing that all ground leases were prima facieunconscionable bargains, there is no reason for limiting the right of enfranchisementto occupying ground tenants of residential property. Enfranchisement is in factadvocated mainly on social grounds to protect certain tenants in the occupationof their homes and on this basis it would not be rebutted by demonstrating that
the original bargain was perfectly fair, or even generous, to the tenant. In con-sidering the principle, therefore, of a scheme limited to occupying residential groundlessees (and ignoring for the moment the question of the proper compensation), thequestion whether the&quot; original bargain was unconscionable or not is neither herenor there.14. If, at the expiry of a ground lease, the landlord and the tenant were always the same as at the beginning, or had succeeded by inheritance to the originalparties&apos; interests, the question would be simple to frame and the answer, though not easy to reach, simple to give effect to. This, so far as tenants are concernedfis the&quot; South Wales &quot; case. The ground tenants live in houses which were erected bytheir fathers or grandfathers, and which they look on as theirs. But although this class of. case is frequently mentioned, the Leasehold Committee found no evidencethat it is at all common, and it is submitted that it ought not to weigh heavily inthe consideration of the question. The Minority did not found themselves primarilyupon it. They were concerned with all cases where the ground tenant had estab-Iished himself in the house as his home, whether or not his forbears had lived init, or built it.15. The general conception of the Minority was that &quot;the interest of the landlord is an investment or financial interest, and the interest of the tenant is for occupation. . . . The landlords interest in the property is a source of income; the tenants interest is in the use and enjoyment of the property itself. What is ofimportance to the &quot;landlord is not the property, but the money which it represents:what is of importance to the tenant is the property itself particularly when thatproperty is his home and perhaps his father&apos;s home before him.&quot; And they con-sidered that the tenant should be enabled to perpetuate his &quot; occupying &quot; interest on satisfying the landlords &quot; financial &quot; interest by a fair financial settlement.16. There are thus two questions first, whether the respective natures ofthe landlords interest and the tenants interest are such as to make it just that thetenant should be enabled compulsorily to enlarge his own interest and to extinguishthe landlords, and secondly, if so, what price he should pay on exercising his power.17. Both these questions are much affected by the fact that interests inleasehold property (both landlords&apos; and tenants&apos;) are frequently bought and soldduring the latter part of the lease, when, owing to the prospect of the lease&apos;sexpiry, the landlords interest becomes worth progressively more than the capital value of the ground rent and the tenants interest worth progressively less than thecapital value of the freehold. During the early part of the term, there might belittle difficulty in deciding both that the landlords interest was financial only andthat ii could be equitably extinguished on the payment by the tenant of the capital value of the ground rent. But, of course, a right of leasehold enfranchisementlimited to the early part of the term would not really touch the problem, for it isat the end of the term that the question becomes acute.18. In describing the landlords interest as a purely financial one, the Minoritywere perhaps somewhat less than fair to the landlords case. He may have boughtthe reversion from a previous landlord, ten or fifteen years (or less) before the endof the term, paying a price which reflected the value of the prospective possessionof the house at the end of the term that is, he paid much more than the capital value of the ground rent. His motives may have been purely financial i.e., theproperty may have appeared a sound investment with the prospect of a good rackrent after the termination of the ground lease. But he may very well have boughtwith a view to occupation of the house by himself or his family, or with a view todemolition and re-development which may be very much in the public interest;or he may need the premises for the extension of a business carried on in adjoiningpremises.19. The tenant, on the other hand, if he bought his interest from a previoustenant ten or fifteen years (or less) before the end of the lease, was buying no more than a limited period of occupancy, and was undertaking potentially heavyliabilities for maintenance and repair. He paid much less than he would havehad to pay if he had been buying the permanent occupation of a freehold house.If both the landlords interest and the tenants interest have been acquired bypurchase towards the end of the term from a previous landlord and a previoustenant respectively (as they often have) it is a little difficult to conclude that thepresent tenants interest is really more &quot; deserving &quot; than the present landlords,
the original bargain was perfectly fair, or even generous, to the tenant. In con-sidering the principle, therefore, of a scheme limited to occupying residential groundlessees (and ignoring for the moment the question of the proper compensation), thequestion whether the&apos; original bargain was unconscionable or not is neither herenor there.14. If, at the expiry of a ground lease, the landlord and the tenant were always the same as at the beginning, or had succeeded by inheritance to the originalparties&apos; interests, the question would be simple to frame and the answer, though not easy to reach, simple to give effect to. This, so far as tenants are concerned, is the&quot; South Wales &quot; case. The ground tenants live in houses which were erected bytheir fathers or grandfathers, and which they look on as theirs. But although this class of case is frequently mentioned, the Leasehold Committee found no evidencethat it is at all common, and it is submitted that it ought not to weigh heavily inthe consideration of the question. The Minority did not found themselves primarilyupon it. They were concerned with all cases where the ground tenant had estab-lished himself in the house as his home, whether or not his forbears had lived init, or built it.15. The general conception of the Minority was that &quot;the interest of the landlord is an investment or financial interest, and the interest of the tenant is for occupation. . . . The landlords interest in the property is a source of income; the tenants interest is in the use and enjoyment of the property itself. What is ofimportance to the landlord is not the property, but the money which it represents:what is of importance to the tenant is the property itself particularly when thatproperty is his home and perhaps his father&apos;s home before him.&quot; And they con-sidered that the tenant should be enabled to perpetuate his &quot; occupying &quot; interest on satisfying the landlords &quot; financial &quot; interest by a fair financial settlement.16. There are thus two questions first, whether the respective natures ofthe landlords interest and the tenants interest are such as to make it just that thetenant should be enabled compulsorily to enlarge his own interest and to extinguishthe landlords, and secondly, if so, what price he should pay on exercising his power.17. Both these questions are much affected by the fact that interests inleasehold property (both landlords&apos; and tenants&apos;) are frequently bought and soldduring the latter part of the lease, when, owing to the prospect of the lease&apos;sexpiry, the landlords interest becomes worth progressively more than the capital value of the ground rent and the tenanfs interest worth progressively less than thecapital value of the freehold. During the early part of the term, there might belittle difficulty in deciding both that the landlords interest was financial only andthat it could be equitably extinguished on the payment by the tenant of the capital value of the ground rent. But, of course, a right of leasehold enfranchisementlimited to the early part of the term would not really touch the problem, for it isat the end of the term that the question becomes acute.18. In describing the landlords interest as a purely financial one, the Minority-were perhaps somewhat less than fair to the landlords case. He may have boughtthe reversion from a previous landlord ten or fifteen years (or less) before the endof the term, paying a price which reflected the value of the prospective possessionof the house at the end of the term that is, he paid much more than the capital value of the ground rent. His motives may have been purely financial i.e., theproperty may have appeared a sound investment with the prospect of a good rackrent after the termination of the ground lease. But he may very well have boughtwith a view to occupation of the house by himself or his family, or with a view todemolition and re-development which may be very much in the public interest;or he may need the premises for the extension of a business carried on in adjoiningpremises.19. The tenant, on the other hand, if he bought his interest from a previoustenant ten or fifteen years (or less) before the end of the lease, was buying no more than a limited period of occupancy, and was undertaking potentially heavyliabilities for maintenance and repair. He paid much less than he would havehad to pay if he had been buying the permanent occupation of a freehold house.If both the landlords interest and the tenanfs interest have been acquired bypurchase towards the end of the term from a previous landlord and a previoustenant respectively (as they often have) it is a little difficult to conclude that thepresent tenanfs interest is really more &quot; deserving &quot; than the present landlords,
and that he has an unchallengeable moral right to defeat the landlords intentionsby himself remaining in occupation as freeholder after the expiry of the lease, evenon suitable terms.20. If the tenant bought, say, the last 14 years of the ground lease (by paying a capital sum plus ground rent), he is not really in any different position from theman who bought 14 years of occupation of a similar house by way of an ordinaryoccupational lease for 14 years at a rack rent. Actuarially (and allowing for any difference in liability for repairs) they paid the same amount for the same thing.The former seems to have no greater moral right than the latter to a power toobtain compulsorily the freehold ownership. As regards protection of their occupation after the end of their tenancies, their merits again seem to be identical a case of both or neither.21. The Minority recognise that the tenant who buys the end of a lease is less &quot; deserving,&apos;&apos; for purposes of the grant of enfranchisement, than the tenantwith a longer interest, in that they exclude from their scheme tenants who boughttheir interest within ten years of the end of the term (this is an arbitrary figure which would, of course, provoke differences of opinion). But they do not recognise the corresponding proposition that the landlord who bought his interest towardsthe end of the term is more &quot; deserving,&quot; for purposes of protection from enfranchisement-enfranchisement, than the landlord of longer standing who did not pay (as did the landlord who purchased his interest towards the end of the term) a considerablecapital sum specifically for the prospects of the reversion.22. Yet if it is fair to exclude the &apos;4 late-purchaser &quot; tenant from the rightto enfranchise, so is it fair to protect the &quot; late-purchaser &quot; landlord from therisk of enfranchisement. On the other hand, it seems rather a capricious result,as between two longstanding tenants, if one can enfranchise and the other cannotowing to a late change in the ownership of the reversion; and, conversely, asbetween two longstanding landlords, if one is at risk of enfranchisement and theother immune owing to a late change in the ownership of the tenancy. From that point of view, therefore, neither exclusion is fair.23. Moreover, whether or not both exclusions are regarded as fair for genuinecases, both would appear to open the door to some undesirable manipulation.Thus, if immunity from enfranchisement (save by consent) is conferred on the land-lord who acquires his interest in, say, the last decade of the lease, any landlordcan defeat the enfranchisement scheme by conveying&apos;his interest to, say, a relationor business partner just before the beginning of the final decade and buying it back immediately after. The consideration might be the full market value or a nominal figure. The tenant would be helpless unless he were prepared to exercise his right to enfranchise before the deal was through.24. Again, the exclusion which the Minority themselves propose (i.e., of thetenant who has acquired his interest in the last decade of the term) means that thenormal annual depreciation in the market capital value of the tenants interest willbe specially accelerated at the beginning of the final decade, because the asset whichhe can offer for sale will then no longer include the right to enfranchise the leasewithout the landlords consent, but will be limited to the rights conferred bythe lease itself, together with any rights which may be conferred by legislationaffecting security of tenure after the lease&apos;;; expiry. The amount of this specialdepreciation will depend on the extent to which the right of enfranchisementis regarded as a valuable (and thus marketable) privilege, if granted over and above a new right to security of tenure at the expiry of the lease. Some difference theremust be, and this imports a new complication into the valuation of land (forpurposes of compulsory acquisition and death duties, as well as private bargains).It must also create a special market in leasehold houses whose leases have morethan ten years to run. To the extent that the power to enfranchise is a valuableasset a tenant, even if he does not wish to exercise the power himself, will always be anxious to avoid the financial effects to himself of the disappearance of the rightat the beginning of the last decade. If, for instance, he wishes to move elsewhereand his landlord is, for any reason, anxious to avoid the enfranchisement of the lease, the tenant will be able to exact from the landlord just before the start of thefinal decade a sum of money in consideration of the tenants willingness not to assign his interest (to a tenant who wishes to enfranchise) until after the finaldecade has started that is, until the right has disappeared. It is perhaps hardlyin the public interest to create a situation of this kind.
25. It would, of course, be possible to limit the exclusion of &quot; late-purchaser &quot; landlords and/or &quot; late-purchaser&quot; tenants to those who had alreadybought their interests during the last decade of the term but before the commence-ment of the legislation. It could then be assumed that any landlord or tenant whobought his interest after that date would do so in the knowledge that the leasecarried with it the right of compulsory enfranchisement a right which the market would take into account in fixing the price. A transitional provision of this kind would, however, lead to some complication, and it is at least doubtful whether itwould ever be desirable to give a right of enfranchisement to the purchaser of thefag-end of a lease, having regard to the possibilities of speculation and fictitiousoccupancies.26. If, therefore, the principle of leasehold enfranchisement for occupyingground lessees is conceded, on broad social and political grounds, this furtherdilemma has to be faced. To concede the right of compulsory enfranchisementat the tenants option without any &quot; strings &quot; would appear quite irrespective of the question of compensation to do more than justice to those tenants, and less than justice to those landlords, who acquired their interests towards the endof the term. The Minority propose a condition to avoid the first of these results,but it does not seem to work out satisfactorily. Any attempt to avoid bothresults (or, indeed, either of them) creates a fresh set of difficulties, and if these alsowere to be dealt with we should clearly be led into provisions which would bevery complex, very contentious, probably far from watertight and almost certainlyvery fruitful of litigation. If, therefore, enfranchisement is accepted in principle,there is something to be said for attaching no strings at ail, and, when the inevitableinjustices and possibilities of speculation are pointed out, tor defending the position on broad political grounds by the plea that it would, on balance, be a greater socialevil to have no provision for compulsory enfranchisement at all.27. The Majority use a number of arguments against leasehold enfranchise-ment, some of which do not apply to the restricted form of leasehold enfranchise-ment favoured by the Minority. We summarise some of the others, with the minority&apos;s answers, but we do not feel that they are really important to theconclusion.(i) Majority: Leasehold enfranchisement attacks the sanctity of contracts.Minority: There is no sanctity in a contract which is unjust.(ii) Majority: It attacks the right of property.   Minority: Property carriesobligations towards the community as well as rights, and the onlyjustifiable rights are those which serve those obligations.(iii) Majority: It involves the novel principle of compulsory purchase for private purposes. Compulsory purchase is only justifiable if it will ensure that the freehold will be used to the greater benefit of thecommunity, or if it is an essential first step in a beneficial reform ofland tenure. Minority: These should not be the only criteria; com-pulsory purchase may be justified, e.g., in order to remove injustice or social friction.(iv) Majority: The leasehold system under which large estates are held in asingle freehold ownership is beneficial from the point of view of estate management, orderly development, and the proper use of land.Minority: This is by no means always true, and the objectives can inany case now be achieved by other means.*(v) Majority: Except in the case of any landlords who may be excepted fromthe scheme, it would mean the virtual disappearance of building leasesin future.  Minority: This would be no disadvantage.28. We do not consider that further argument would really facilitate the cabinets decision. Abstract principle is certainly not decisive either way. there seems no doubt that, from the point of view of real justice as between landlord and tenant, regard should be paid to the nature, of their respective interests, and* This raises only the comparatively narrow question whether a multiplicity of small residentialfreeholders is in the interests of the immediate locality, and there are some special planningconsiderations here from the point of view of facilitating re-development. But there is also the much wider question whether such a multiplicity is in the general national interest from the point of viewof the economic, structure of the country. Not only, is there the question whether the preservation of the nation&apos;s housing capital would be as well served if full repairing liabilities rested, generallyspeaking, on occupiers: there are also other implications so political in character that we do not feel we should comment on them.
that the balance between the two parties varies according to the length of theunexpired portion of the lease and according to how, when, and why each partyacquired his interest. But it seems equally clear that a scheme which made theright of enfranchisement dependent on all these factors would be much too com-plicated to be satisfactory, and would involve a number of purely arbitrary dividinglines which would make the legislation most difficult to commend persuasively to public opinion or to conduct successfully through Parliament.Compensation .for Enfranchisement29. The price which the tenant should pay for the enfranchisement of hislease is the vital point in any enfranchisement scheme. In the case of some lease-hold estates, the landlord (often an Estate Company) is unwilling, whatever theprice offered, to sell a part of the estate, either for commercial reasons or in theinterests of the estate as a whole. But in most cases there is reason to think thatlandlords are not in general averse in principle from selling their interests to their tenants: it is the difficulty of agreeing on price which is usually the stumbling-block.30. The difficulty in fixing by legislation what price should be paid by a tenant on exercising a statutory power of enfranchisement at his own option arises in the latter part of the term, when the market values of the landlords interestand the tenants interest have begun to appreciate and to depreciate respectively.The most obvious answer is that the tenant should pay the current value of the land-lord^ interest, since that is what he is acquiring and what the landlord is losing.But, except in the early years of the term, this answer would be wholly unattractiveto tenants who are seldom in a position to find the necessary money,* and it wouldtake no account of the &quot; social &quot; or &quot; equitable &quot; arguments of the advocates ofleasehold enfranchisement. It therefore becomes necessary to take a view on whether or not the landlord ought to remain entitled to the value of his presentlegal rights. If so, the full market value is the only answer: anything less is unjustified-fied confiscation. If not, exaction of the full market value as the price of enfranchisement-enfranchisement represents a mere confirmation in another form of the landlords existingexploitation of the tenant.31. There is no doubt that enfranchisement on what may be called &quot;fullcompensation &quot; terms would just not be worth enacting, because it would almostnever be resorted to. And it can reasonably be held that it would proceed on a somewhat extreme view viz., that nothing must ever be done, even for socialreasons, to depreciate the value of land, or to convert a good bargain retrospectivelyinto a bad one, without full compensation. In fact, of course. Government actionfrequently depreciates the market value of property without compensation themost obvious examples being the enactment and subsequent extension of the rent restriction Acts and of legislation dealing with slum clearance. The extreme view on the other side is that the landlord is entitled to no compensation at all in respectof the reversion, and that the most he should be given is a continuation of theground rent or a sum representing its capital value. This latter view we againassume that the Cabinet would not wish to entertain, since the Minority themselvesreject it; (enfranchisement on these terms is the same in principle as a proposalsimply to continue the ground lease at the existing ground rent, or to convert it intoa lease for 999 years it is very nearly complete confiscation).32. The Minority&apos;s solution of the problem of compensation, which theyadvanced somewhat tentatively, relies on the recommendations made else wherein the Report for a general improvement in security of tenure for residential tenants.These are dealt with more fully below, but it is necessary to anticipate them here.First, it is suggested that occupying ground lessees should no longer be denied thebenefits of the Rent Acts on the ground that their rent is less than two-thirds ofthe rateable value of the house. This would mean that, on the expiry of the groundlease of a house within the Rent Act limits, an occupying ground lessee would continue as a statutory tenant. Second, it is suggested that all occupying tenants of unfurnished residential property outside the Rent Act limits, whether underground leases or not, should have a prima facie right to the renewal of theirtenancies at a fair market rack rent to be fixed in default of agreement by theTribunal.   If these suggestions were adopted, the occupying ground lessee of a* it has been suggested that the tenant might be advanced the money on easy terms e.g., bythe local authority or that he might discharge his debt by instalments in the form of a &quot; rent&quot;after enfranchisement (substantially higher than the previous ground rent). These suggestions ma^keno difference in principle to this part of the argument.
house would, on the expiry of the ground lease, be entitled to remain in occupationas a protected tenant either (if the house were small enough) under the terms ofthe Rent Acts, or (if it were not) under the terms of the new legislation. The land-lord would in either case be able to secure possession in certain circumstances, butthe effect would, of course, be to depreciate considerably the value of his interest,not only after but also for some considerable period before the expiry of the groundlease.33. On the assumption that these changes are made, the Minority proposethat compensation for the enfranchisement of the lease should be the fair market value of the reversion (subject to a deduction for uncovenanted improvements madeby the tenant or his predecessors in title). &quot; The result roughly would be that untilthe last 25 years or so of the lease, the compensation would be the market priceof the ground rent, and that during the last 25 years or so, the compensation would increase up to a maximum, immediately before the expiration of the lease, of themarket value of the reversion of the property as a rent-controlled property with asitting tenant.&quot;34. It is difficult to think of any scheme of compensation which better com-bines a show of concession for the tenant with a show of equity for the landlord.It is certainly far superior to any scheme based on an arbitrary number of years&apos;purchase of the market rent, which is bound to work inequitably (in one directionor the other) in particular cases. That is not to say that either party would be wholly satisfied. Tenants who wish, in effect, to be relieved of the terminal obli-gations of their ground lease would feel they are paying more than the landlorddeserves; and landlords would suggest that this is really partial confiscation carriedout by stages first, their rights to the reversion of the house are drasticallydiminished without compensation by the legislation which gives the tenantcontinued security on expiry of the ground lease; then the tenant is given power at his own option to extinguish the landlords interest altogether, and to do so, more-over, at the depreciated price consequent on the first stage. Whatever be the force ofthese arguments, we submit that if leasehold enfranchisement is to be introduced,this, or something like it, is the best scheme of compensation to prescribe. Inother words, the measures for increased security of tenure are a pre-requisite for introducing leasehold enfranchisement with a scheme of compensation which is atall worth while and at the same time at all fair.35. Incidentally, it is on the same assumption as to new measures forincreased security of tenure that the Minority conclude that no minimum periodof residence by the tenant need be prescribed as a condition for the enfranchisementof his lease. But this point- which has caused some little trouble in the context of the temporary Bill will certainly require further consideration.Ancillary matters the question of exceptions36. If a scheme of leasehold enfranchisement on the lines favoured by the minority were to be introduced, there would be a number of rather difficult minorquestions to settle as regards, for instance, the unit of enfranchisement, thepurchase of intermediate interests, the covenants under the original lease, and themachinery for enfranchisement. But the only ancillary question which we think the Cabinet would wish to consider at this stage is the extent of exceptions fromthe scheme.37. Some landlords of leasehold estates are semi-charitable bodies, whosepurpose is the welfare of their tenants and who hold their land on trust for thatpurpose such as the Bournville Village Trust. Some again (such as UniversityColleges and the Church Estates Commissioners) hold their estates as an investmentbut apply the revenues to educational or charitable purposes and not to privateor commercial profit. Large leasehold estates are also owned by public bodies,such as the Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster and the Commissioners of crown lands, and the system has also been largely extended by legislation passed since1945. The new Towns Act, 1946, contemplates that Development Corporationswill conduct their development mainly on the building lease system, and the sameis true of the Town and Country Planning Acts, as respects the comprehensivere-development of blitzed and blighted areas by local planning authorities. Indeed,under these Acts, Development Corporations and local authorities are expresslyprevented, save in exceptional circumstances, from disposing of freeholds.
s38. The Minority see no reason to exempt such bodies from the principles oftheir proposals, except where a case could be made for exceptional treatment forthe purpose of distinctive public functions. They appear to contemplate that onthis basis Development Corporations and bodies like the Bournville Village Trustmight be excepted from the scheme. It would, however, be very difficult to differ-entiate, as between non-official landlords, in favour of such bodies as the BournvilleVillage Trust. The Trust are a model landlord, but in that they resemble somelandlords who are not Trusts and differ from some landlords who are. We do notthink it possible to identify accurately by legal definition the bodies whom the minority have in mind.39. The Minority make no corresponding suggestion as regards educationalor ecclesiastical bodies, the Duchies, the Commissioners of Crown Lands or localauthorities. It is, however, for consideration whether it would be justifiable toimpose on the Duchies and the Crown Lands Commissioners so drastic an alter-ation in their affairs as would or might ensue from the grant to their tenants of theright of leasehold enfranchisement. It is also for consideration whether the policyof the redevelopment provisions of the Town and Country Planning Acts, as of theNew Towns Act, could properly be served if the comprehensive control which canbe exercised by the public authority in its capacity as landlord were to be diminished.(b) Improved Security of Tenure for Residential TenantsMinor Proposals40. There were two proposals under this head on which the Leasehold Com-mittee were unanimous. The first is that occupying ground-leases of houses withinthe Rent Act limits should, on the expiry of the lease, enjoy the protection of thoseActs which they are at present denied if, as is usually the case, the ground rentis less than two-thirds of the rateable value. The second was that occupying sub-tenants holding at rack rents from an intermediate ground lessee who are protectedunder the Rent Acts so long as the intermediate ground lease lasts, should continueto be protected as statutory tenants of the ground landlord when the intermediateground lease expires. (This latter proposal represents what was always thought to be the existing law until the decision of the Court of Appeal in KnightsbridgeEstates Trust, Ltd. v. Deeley)  The only arguments against these proposals are:  (1) That it might well be desirable in the public interest that on the expiry of a long lease the house (which must necessarily be many years old)should fall into the possession of the ground landlord in order tofacilitate reconstruction or redevelopment rather than that it should remain for an indefinite period in the occupation of a statutory tenant,with probably further deterioration in its state of repair. This, however,is an argument which can be directed against the Rent Acts in general.(2) That these would be direct amendments of the Rent Acts. The Govern-ment may not be prepared in 1952-53 to undertake amendment of the rent Acts in general, and it may be politically awkward to offer theseminor amendments. Probably, however, it would be possible to defendthese two proposals as being required for special reasons connected withthe subject matter of this particular legislation, he., as part of a reform of the law relating to residential property under building leases, ratherthan of the Rent Acts as such.(3) The first proposal (though not the second) raises some difficult questions about the relations between landlord and tenant when the latter becomes a statutory tenant under the Rent Acts instead of an occupying tenantunder a ground lease. The Committee unanimously contemplate thata rack rent should be fixed by a Tribunal as the standard rent, but thereare differences of opinion between the Majority and the Minority aboutwho the Tribunal should be, about accrued liabilities under the repair-ing covenants of the expiring ground lease, and about liabilities to repair in future (though both recognise that some adjustment is necessaryhere). These are real difficulties, but the Cabinet may be content atthis stage to assume that, if the proposal is approved in principle, asatisfactory solution can be worked out.,
The Major Proposal41. The Majority contented themselves with these two proposals. But a supplementary Report signed by five of the Committee&apos;s ten members (the twoLabour members, the Liberal member and two of the independent members) furtherproposed that all tenants under unfurnished leases of houses too big to attract the protection of the Rent Acts should be given a measure of security of tenure.The scope of this proposal is in effect all rack-rent tenants of unfurnished houses and flats whose rateable value exceeds the limits laid down in the Rent Acts; anda decision in its favour would of course imply a decision not to extend the scopeof the Rent Acts to all such properties.42. The proposal is really linked with the proposals to give security of tenureto business tenants, and the main reason advanced for it was that it would beanomalous if security of tenure were enjoyed in one way or another by all classesof tenant whether business or residential, except only residential tenants of medium and large-sized houses. It was further suggested that the scope of the Rent Actsthemselves may well be diminished by legislative action in future, and that it wouldbe an advantage if tenants who thus lost the protection of the Rent Actsautomatically qualified for an alternative form of protection.43. The form of the proposal was that the tenant should have a prima facieright of renewal of his lease at a fair current market rent (not a standard rent in the sense of the Rent Acts) to be fixed in default of agreement by a tribunal thecounty court with expert assessors. The term would be in the discretion of theTribunal, not exceeding 14 years in the first place, and the tenant would, subjectto the Tribunal, have the same rights of assignment as under his original lease. Theright would further be subject to &quot; just exceptions &quot; similar to those proposed for business premises and including in particular provision for the landlord to defeat the tenanfs claim if the premises are required for demolition, remodelling or redevelopment or for the occupation of the landlord or his children. It seems fairlycertain that the legislation would have to prevent any arrangement between the landlord and the tenant for &quot; contracting out,&quot; and there therefore seems no doubtthat the &quot; just exceptions &quot; would have to be framed at least as widely as this,since otherwise very considerable inhibitions would be placed on all forms of lettingof unfurnished premises.44. The case against the proposal is not argued by those members of theCommittee who did not sign the Supplementary Report, but it presumably rests on the view that a strong positive case would be required for so considerable a,ndnovel an amendment of the law and that no such strong case exists. The case forthe proposal as stated above perhaps derives some support from political con-siderations. If the principle of leasehold enfranchisement were rejected thenpermanent legislation which went no further than the two unanimous proposalsmentioned in paragraph 40 above together with minor and technical amendments of the law would, from the point of view of residential tenants, be a very thinmeasure. But if it also included this proposal to give improved security of tenureto all unfurnished residential tenants of every kind, then those who were dis-appointed by a decision adverse to leasehold enfranchisement might very well be reconciled, and indeed such a measure might well command fairly wide support from all parties as a via media and its progress through Parliament would thus be facilitated. If, on the other hand, the decision were in favour of the principle ofleasehold enfranchisement then as suggested in paragraph 34 the present proposalappears to be necessary in order to provide a foundation for any reasonable andworthwhile scheme of compensation for enfranchisement.45. We apprehend, therefore, that the Cabinet will be favourably disposed tothis proposal in principle, subject to the further working out of the details.46. Here, again, there is the question whether the tenants of premises owned bythe Crown or other public authorities should be excluded from the proposal. the supplementary Report suggests that they should be included, except for &quot; municipaltenants,&quot; i.e., tenants of houses provided by a local authority in its capacity as a housing authority. In other cases, however, the Tribunal would be debarred fromgranting a new tenancy if the Crown or other public landlord proved that possessionwas reasonably required for the purposes of their distinctive statutory functions(for example, residential premises acquired by a highway authority in advance forroad widening and temporarily let pending the maturity of the road scheme). Onthe principle that the Crown and other public landlords ought not to be excludedfrom measures restrictive of landlords&apos; rights generally, save on specific grounds
of public interest, this appears a reasonable conclusion (though, following the usual practice, the Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster should probably be invited, ratherthan bound by statute, to comply with the proposal). There is also the questionwhether &quot; public interest&quot; ought to be determined by the Tribunal or to remain the Governments responsibility; this can be settled later.First Refusal47. It has sometimes been suggested that if a ground landlord wishes to sellhis interest, he should be compelled to give his tenant (if in occupation) a rightof &quot; first refusal.&quot; The Leasehold Committee considered the proposal, but con-cluded that it was not practicable to enforce it by legislation. The question onlyarises, of course, if Leasehold Enfranchisement is rejected. We have examined the proposal in some detail, but consider that it could be implemented, if at all,only in a form so restricted as not to be worth while. The proposal certainlycould not be presented by opponents of Leasehold Enfranchisement as an attractivealternative remedy.SUMMARY48. The following are the questions on which the Cabinefs instructions aresought:  Security of Tenure for Residential tenants.   Should the minor proposals in paragraph 40 be approved?2. (i) Should the legislation contain provisions giving a prima facie rightto the grant of a new lease to all unfurnished tenants outside thescope of the Rent Acts on the general lines of the supplementary report (subject to turther working out of details)?(ii) In particular, should renewal be (a) at a fair market rent,(b) subject to a fairly wide list of i4 just exceptions,&quot;thus differentiating the scheme from that of the Rent Acts?(iii) Should the tenants to be covered by the proposal (a) include tenants of the Crown, Government Departments, local and other public authorities, with the proviso that their claimcould be defeated if possession is reasonably required for theexercise of the landlords distinctive public functions?(b) exclude the ordinary &quot; municipal tenant&quot;?Leasehold Enfranchisement3. Should the principle of Leasehold Enfranchisement be approved, on thefooting that it would be limited, as the Minority propose, to occupy-ing ground lessees of residential property?4. If so, should the scheme of compensation be on the lines proposed by the minority? (That is, the landlords right of possession, and thus thevalue of the reversion, would be restricted by enactment of the pro-posals referred to in questions 1 and 2 above, and compensation forenfranchisement would be the market value of the reversion as soaffected, subject to adjustment for tenant&apos;s improvements.)5. (i) If leasehold enfranchisement is approved, to what extent, if any,should there be exemption qua ground landlords,(a) for the Crown, Government Departments, local and other public authorities (i) as respects property held primarily for investment?(ii) as respects property held primarily for development?(b) for estate owners, such as University Colleges, who run theirestates as an investment, applying the revenue for educationalor charitable purposes?(ii) Should any attempt be made, whether in the legislation itself or bysubordinate instruments under statutory powers, to exclude &quot; modellandlords &quot; such as the Bournville Village Trust, who run their estatesas a semi-charitable activity?(iii) Should the scheme exclude cases where (a) the landlord or (b) thetenant acquired his interest near the end of the term say, during itslast ten years?
