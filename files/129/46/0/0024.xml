(51) 17423rd June, 1951CABINETECONOMIC report note by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate herewith a note on the more important statistics relating to theeconomic situation which have become available since the last Economic Report(CP. (51) 113).H. G.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,22nd June, 1951ECONOMIC report . Man-power at the end of April there were more people in work in civil employment andmore men and women in the Forces than at the beginning of the year. Over thefour months the number in the Armed Forces and Women&apos;s Services rose by 66,000,but the increase in the working population and the marked drop in the unemployedpermitted ah increase in the number of persons in civil employment since thebeginning of the year of 108,000. The most significant increases in employmenthave been in coal mining and the engineering and metals industries.2. At the end of April the number in the Armed Forces and Women&apos;s Serviceswas 818,000, compared with 752,000 at the end of 1950 and 846,000 at the middleof 1948. The number in the Armed Forces will continue to increase due to the recallof regular reservists to the Navy, the retention of time-expired regulars to all three services and additional recruitment. The published figures-of the strengths of theForces will not include &quot; Z &quot; reservists who are called back for two weeks training.3. Not only has the number employed in industry increased this year, butthere has been little evidence as yet of short-time working. Returns collectedquarterly from the manufacturing industries (excluding shipbuilding and ship repair-ing) show that at the end of March only 18,000 operatives in those industries were working short-time less than in September and March 1950, although the figure forMarchT951 may have been affected by the Easter holidays. These operatives werelosing an average of 14 hours a week, while on the other hand more than a millionoperatives were reported to be working overtime in that week. There was moreshort-time, however, than six months before in textiles, chemicals and allied trades,metal manufacture, vehicles, and other metal goods industries.: 9,700 were affectedas against 4,800 in September 1950. Reports received from the Ministry of40686 B
Labour&apos;s Regional Controllers since March do not reveal any extensive redundanciesor short-time working in manufacturing industries owing to shortages of rawmaterials, but some of the large firms making motor vehicles have been workingshort-time for some weeks. .4. Unemployment has been falling continuously since the beginning of theyear and the number of registered unemployed in Great Britain was 216,000 on21st May the lowest level since September 1945. Less than 100,000 had on that day been unemployed for more than eight weeks.5. Unemployment in the Development Areas has fallen in parallel with thereduction in unemployment for the country as a whole. At 21st May the numberof unemployed in the Development Areas was 89,000; these accounted, as in pre-vious months, for about two-fifths of the total unemployment in the country.II. Production6. The index of industrial production (1946 = 100) fell from 150 in february to 140 in March, mainly owing to the Easter holidays; the April figure is estimated to be 150-151. So far this year the index has been running at about seven points(5 per cent.) above the level of the corresponding months of last year.Coal7. In the first twenty-four weeks up to 16th June, 99-52 million tons of deepmined coal were produced this year, compared with 95-76 million tons in thecorresponding period last year. Deliveries of opencast coal have, however, beenlower-4-84 compared with 5-86 million tons mainly because of bad weather conditions. Imports of coal have been 1 -12 million tons this year.8. The growth of the mining labour force ended in April; since then therehas been a net loss of 1,000 men. However, the total of wage-earners on the collierybooks is still higher than it was a year ago.9. Inland consumption of coal continues to be higher than last year and hasbeen rising at a higher rate than the growth of output; but because of the reduc-tion of exports by more than half, stocks have now, after the end of the winter,begun to increase. At the middle of June stocks were about 950,000 tons higherthan at the same time last year.Steel10. The level of output of steel for the rest of 1951 is still doubtful. steel production in the first five months of the year was lower than in the same periodlast year but to produce 16 million tons this year depends on how far the output of pig iron can be further increased during the later months of 1951, and on the successof obtaining supplies of scrap from abroad and at home as well as providing shipping to import iron ore in sufficient quantities.Textiles11. Over the first five months of the year output of textile yarns and fabricshas been somewhat higher than last year, more especially in cotton yarn andcloth. The most disturbing feature has been the fall of production of rayon yarnand staple fibre from the level it reached in the second half of 1950. The manufactureof rayon, which has been expanding steadily since the end of the war, is now limited by the shortage of sulphur. Output of nylon, however, continues to expand and reached the record weekly level of 192,850 lb. in April.Motor vehicles12. In the first twenty-one weeks of this year up to the end of May the numberof passenger cars and chassis produced was 6 per cent, less than in the correspondingperiod of last year. A larger proportion of the cars made, however, was of the.1,600 c.c. class and over, so that production was broadly about the same in bothperiods. About 80 per cent, of the cars produced in the period January to May lastyear were for export; in the same period this year the percentage was 70 per cent.13. The number of commercial vehicles produced up to the end of May thisyear was 2 per cent, higher than in the corresponding period last year. Output oftrucks over six tons was increased but there was a marked fall in public servicevehicles.  Exports still account like last year for nearly two-thirds of production.
Merchant shipbuilding14. There appears to be no shortage of work in the ship yards. The grosstonnage of new merchant ships under construction is more than a year ago (two-fifths for export), and at the same time more naval work is being given to privateyards.Building15. The number of permanent houses completed in Great Britain during Aprilwas 15,123, compared with 16,757 in March. The number completed in the first four months of the year was 59,014 against 62,672 in the same period last year.16. Building has been held up this year owing to bad weather conditions,and partly in consequence, stocks of building bricks which reached a very low level at the end of last year have risen. Stocks of softwood, plasterboard, roofing feltand clay roofing tiles were lower at the end of April 1951 than they were a year ago.m-Stocks17. The index of the volume of stocks (December 1949=100) which relates to items of food, feeding stuffs, raw materials, tobacco and petroleum products which are chiefly obtained from abroad, fell from 86 at the end of 1950 to 78 atthe end of March. The figures for March 1951 exclude stocks acquired for thestockpiling programme since the beginning of the year. These strategic stockswould not add more than two or three points to the index of total stocks at theend of March.Slocks Index of Volume(December 1949=100)	Total		Raw	Petroleum	Stocks (a)	Food	Materials	ProductsMarch 1950	...   92	91	92	100June 1950	...   93	95	92	104September 1950	- ...   89	85	91	101December 1950	...   86	79	85	103March 1951 (provisional)   78		69	78	103(a) Including tobacco.18. Over the first quarter of the year, the heaviest fall took place in stocks offood, particularly meat. Stocks of steel scrap and imported iron ore fellsubstantially and there was a seasonal decline in stocks of timber. There was little change over the quarter in the stocks of sulphur and sulphuric acid-making materials.IV. Internal Financial Situation19. The situation continues to be dominated by the rise in import prices, whichit is now known will be even greater than forecast in the Economic Survey. Therise in retail prices now taking place is mainly due to higher import costsover the past year: even if import prices remain about stable, retail prices willcontinue to rise as the higher priced imports reach the shops irt the form of manufactured goods. Recent wage increases, though accompanied by someincreases in productivity, must also have caused a rise in internal costs of production which will also be reflected in rising retail prices.20. While there is evidence of a slackening of consumer demand in reaction to recent anticipatory buying, order books for durable goods generally are tending,if anything, to lengthen. Unemployment figures continue to reflect the very highdemand for labour. There may be some hoarding of labour in the industries thatexpect to expand, but,, as yet, no dismissal of labour from industries that may haveto contract.40686 b 2
External Cost Factors .21 Commodity prices-Some world commodity prices have been fallingfrom the high levels earlier in the year. Among non-ferrous metals, tin is stillfalling; others remain firm. Egyptian cotton is below earlier peak prices. Jutehas been rising rapidly and in April was about twice the price a year ago.Rubber has fallen but is still nearly twice the average price for May 1950. Therecent fall in raw wool has left it, on average, over twice as expensive as a year ago.Wheat, maize and barley prices are still rising.22. Import prices rose 8 points between March and April and 6 points between april and May when the index stood at 142 (1950 = 100). Food imports remainingstable for three months rose in April by 6 points because of higher contract prices for meat and dairy produce. There was a further rise in May. The upward trend of raw material prices continues; in May they had risen to a level of 42 per cent,above December and no less than 76 per cent, above the level for 1950.23. Wholesale prices have continued to rise steadily. The Board of TradeIndex (1938 - 100) was 315 in May, an increase of about 9 per cent, during thefirst five months of the year. The price index of basic materials used in manu-facturing industries (other than food), however, fell 8 per cent, between March andMay.Internal Cost Factors24. Wage rates have continued to rise steadily by one point per month andthe index (June 1947=100) reached 118 in May.   The average for 1950 was 111.Demand Factors25. Unemployment in Great Britain on 21st May amounted to only 1 per cent,of total employees., 26. Unfilled vacancies are now considerably more than a year ago 468,000on 9th May compared with 368,000 in May 1950.27. Orders on hand also indicate the continuance of high levels of demand.The increase in total new orders received by the engineering industry continues and delivery times are tending to lengthen. The order load for finished steel is stillincreasing and at the end of March it was equivalent to about 8 months&apos; deliveries.In the first 3 months of 1951 orders exceeded deliveries by about 400,000 tons amonth; almost all products were affected. Over \\ million gross tons of newshipbuilding orders were received during the first three months of this year alone,or not far short of the figure for the whole of 1950. Export and home demand forcotton and rayon textiles continues to be strong.28. Export prices rose from 109 to 118 (1950=100) between February andMay. Export prices have now risen 11 per cent, during this year.29. Retail sales and stocks show a high level of consumer demand but therehas been less anticipatory buying. Total sales of department stores, multiple shops and retail co-operative societies were 15 per cent, higher in March and 14 per cent,higher in April than they were a year ago. The trade of independent retailersalso continues to be considerably higher than a year ago. These figures refer tovalue not volume and do not include many of the more stable components of consumption expenditure.30. Stocks of department stores, multiple shops and retail co-operative societies at the end of April were 16 per cent, higher in value than a year ago;stocks of apparel have been rising and at the end of April were 5 per cent, higherthan a year ago.31. Retail prices. The Interim Index of Retail Prices (June 1947 = 100) rose from 118 in February to 119 in March and 124 in May. All groups show anincrease over the period.Money and.Credit32. Bank loans. Advances to customers by London Clearing Banks were 1,793 million at the middle of May  155 million or 9 per cent, higher than in Maylast year.33. Bank deposits increased during May to  6,149 million 5 per cent, abovethe level of May 1950.
V.-External Financial SituationExternal Trade34. United Kingdom imports were valued at the record figure of  338 million in May, making a total for the first five months of the year of  1,498 million. Thiswas 38 per cent, higher than the monthly average rate for 1950.35. Exports and re-exports in May were valued at  241 million. The total for the first five months of 1951 was  1,096 million; this was 11 per cent, above the monthly average rate for 1950.36. The excess of imports (valued c.i.f.) over exports and re-exports (valuedf.o.b.) in the first five months of 1951 was therefore  402 million compared with 167 million in the first five months of 1950.37. The index of the volume of exports (1947 = 100) was 182 in April and178 in May. The volume of retained imports (1947 = 100) was 128 in april and 136 in May.Exports to the United States and Canada(Monthly averages)	$U.S. million	United		States	Canada	Total18-8	23-9	42-820-4	28-6	48-930-5	30-6	61-035-8	34-4	70-231-3	26-6	57-838-9	39-7	78-730-2	40-4	70-61950-1st quarter 2nd Quarter3rd quarter 4th Quarter1951 1st QuarterAprilMayBalance of Payments38. Gold and dollar position. As foreshadowed in the previous Report, therate of surplus in our gold and dollar accounts has fallen appreciably since the first quarter of this year. Compared with a monthly average of $120 million in January-March the surplus in April amounted to $59 million and in May to only $1 million.If agreement is reached in the present discussions with Egypt, involving a dollarpayment of just under $40 million before the end of this quarter, it is unlikely thatthe whole April-June surplus will be much (if at all) in excess of $50 million. WithE.R.P. receipts (including those of the Irish Republic) of about $60 million, thiswould produce an increase in the reserves over the quarter of little over $100 million,compared with $458 million in the first quarter of 1951 and $544 million in thefourth quarter of 1950.39.  The causes of this deterioration have been mentioned previouslythey are:  (i)BrieflyA steady increase in expenditure on United Kingdom (dollar) imports,which in April and May amounted to approximately $145 million per month compared with a monthly average of $117 million in thefirst quarter.(ii) A substantial increase in spending by Rest of Sterling Area countries,particularly India on her necessary grain imports.(iii) Some seasonal decline in earnings from sales of Rest of Sterling Areaproducts, e.g., cocoa and wool, accentuated by the drop in price of wool, rubber and tin.(iv) The deterioration in the United Kingdom position in E.P.U.  Against areceipt of $76 million in the first quarter of 1951 in settlement of oursurpluses with E.P.U., our total receipts this quarter will amount to only $17 million.
(v) For seasonal and other reasons the acute sterling shortage experiencedby a number of non-sterling countries, resulting in purchases by them of sterling against gold or United States dollars, has been much relieved.In some cases, e.g., Brazil and Japan, earlier purchases on an exchangebasis are now being reversed.40. Against these unfavourable developments receipts from United kingdom exports to the dollar area have been increasing very satisfactorily. In the face of present difficulties, however, affecting particularly shipments of raw materials and semi-manufactured goods, only a limited contribution from this source can beexpected. The present trend in our dollar accounts is, therefore, likely to continue.41&apos;. Sterling liabilities. After increasing by  120 million in January and february this year sterling liabilities in March and April rose by another  170million, of which the Rest of Sterling Area accounted for  133 million and thenon-sterling area for  37 million. This increase in non-sterling area holdings is anew and significant development, though it was inflated by special factors, e.g.,sterling payments to Argentina under our recent agreement. Nevertheless, it is apointer to possible trends in the near future, when our own increasing import requirements, and a falling off in the surplus which the Rest of Sterling Area hasbeen experiencing with non-dollar countries generally, may be expected to bringabout a deterioration in the whole sterling area position with a wide range of non-sterling area countries.European Payments Union42. The United Kingdom had a,net surplus-of  18-5 million with E.P.U.in April 1951, but in May had a deficit of  9-7 million. This is the first time thatthe United Kingdom has been in deficit with E.P.U. since July 1950. The total united Kingdom net surplus for the period July 1950 to May 1951 is  235-5 million,and against this, in addition to offsetting conditional aid and the use of sterling balances by other countries to meet deficits with the Union, the United kingdom has received  37 - 8 million in gold and is in credit with E.P.U. to the extent of 113-5 million.43. Germany&apos;s balance of payments position with E.P.U. has improved con-siderably and she had a surplus of $81 million in May. If she chooses to do so itis probable that she will be able to repay by the end of June the special creditextended to her by E.P.U. On 15th June the Council of O.E.E.C. recommended the Federal Government to arrange for the issue of import licences to secure a flow of imports not exceeding $170 million a month. It also instructed the ManagingBoard of E.P.U. to keep Germany&apos;s external financial position under constant review and to report each month any alterations which might be necessary in thetotal of $170 million or in the float of licences to be constituted by the federal government.
APPENDIXNote on Economic Trends in the Untied StatesProduction, employment and hours worked1. Industrial production increased rapidly last autumn; in the first five monthsof 1951 it has been running at 11 per cent, above the .1950 average, and the increasein durable goods production alone was 15 per cent. Production has probably notbeen appreciably limited by the shortages of materials. Non-agricultural employ-ment was per cent, higher than in the first five months of 1950. Average hours worked at 4.1-0 per week in manufacturing in the first four months of the year were 3 per cent, above the average of these months last year.National product and expenditure. (All figures are annual rates, seasonallyadjusted.)2. Partly because of higher production, partly because of higher prices, the gross national product in the first quarter of 1951 was 12 per cent, above the 1950level. Of the increase of $34 billion, $13 billion went to personal consumption,about $10 billion to private domestic investment, and about $10 billion to defence.There was no increase in Government civil expenditure and little change in netforeign investment from a deficit of $2 - 5 to $2 - 6 billion (annual rate) in the first quarter.Unemployment, prices and earnings3. As a result of the high level of demand, unemployment in May at-61 million (2-6 per cent, of civilian labour force) was half the level of May 1950.Prices, which increased rapidly over the last twelve months, have been much morestable recently. Farm prices in March were 28 per cent., and industrial prices about18 per cent., above the level of a year ago, but showed little change in april and industrial prices declined slightly in May. Consumer prices and hourly earningswere both about 10 per cent, higher than a year before; but industrial prices hardlyincreased in April and hourly earnings comparatively little.General prospects4. Future prospects depend partly on how far an inflationary level of total demand can be avoided, partly on the trend in wages, and partly on the course of world commodity prices. An industrial expansion exceeding the rate of expansionof raw materials would tend (in the absence of effective world allocations) to driveup commodity prices, and as a Consequence the general level of prices. this tendency would be accentuated by a very high level of demand in the United Statesof America.5. These dangers are hard to assess. The pressure for wage demands is increasing and the new Wage Stabilization Board may have to grant considerableincreases. At present there is a lull in consumers&apos; demand in reaction to earlieranticipatory buying; but this may not last, and by the autumn the heavier impact of defence expenditure is expected to become apparent. For the 1952 Budgetthe Administration is aiming at a balanced budget, but it is proving difficult toobtain acceptance by Congress even of this limited aim. It is noteworthy, how-ever, that higher corporate taxes had already reduced dividend payments from$11-5 billion in the last quarter of 1950 to $9-3 billion in the first quarter of 1951(annual rates, seasonally corrected). The most effective action has been taken in the sphere of monetary policy. Commercial bank loans and investments at $125-4billion in April were only some 4 per cent, higher than in the same month last year.Trade protests suggest that the restriction of consumer credit is beginning to affectexpenditure on consumer durables, and that tighter credit conditions and the fallin Government bond prices is beginning to restrict new building significantly.
