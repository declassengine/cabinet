[HIS DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY   OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1951CONFIDENTIALCP. (51) 159llth June, 1951CABINETUNITED NATIONS PANEL OF FIELD OBSERVERSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in accordance with a decision of the Fourth Session of the General Assembly,the Secretary-General of the United Nations has initiated action to set up a united nations Panel of Field Observers.2. In a Note Verbale dated 14th June, 1950 (see Annex), he gave details ofthis scheme which is designed to put on a regular basis the recruitment of observersto work with United Nations missions in the field (such as the Special Commissionon the Balkans and the Commission recently operating in Indonesia) whom theywould assist in the functions of observation and supervision (e.g., frontier control,truce observation, &amp;c.) as required. The observers would not be permanent united nations staff, but could be retained by the United Nations for as long as their services were considered necessary for the efficient working of the Commissionconcerned.3. In particular it will be seen that the United Kingdom has been asked tosupply the names of fifty suitable persons, together with a brief description of theirbackground and experience. The Secretary-General has stated (paragraph 3 of the annex) that the Observers should preferably be of the equivalent rank of Majoror Lieutenant-Colonel, on the active list and between the ages of 30 and 45 years.4. In the past His Majesty&apos;s Government^ attitude to a plan for FieldObservers has been cool. In particular we had misgivings about the vagueness of earlier proposals and about the method of recruitment then proposed. SinceMinisters were last consulted (Gen., 261/1st Meeting, 3rd December, 1948), how-ever, the scheme has been substantially modified and the Secretary-GeneraFs latest proposals are no longer open to the major criticisms which were levelled against itin the past.5. It is now for consideration whether, in view of these changed circumstances and the submission of concrete proposals, His Majesty&apos;s Government should change their attitude and agree to supply a list of names to the Secretary-General. It isfor further consideration whether, if we decide to take part in principle, theSecretary-General should be asked to modify the qualifications required for hisobservers.recommendations. (i) His Majesty&apos;s Government should agree to contribute United KingdomObservers to the United Nations Panel on condition that (a) the upper age limit is raised to 55;(b) no serving officers from His Majesty&apos;s forces are nominated;(c) it is clearly understood that the Secretary-General would have to refer toHis Majesty&apos;s Government for the services of any particular memberof the Panel and. that His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot guarantee thatany particular observer will be free when the Secretary-General asks for him.40725Copy No.
2(ii) The Secretary-General should be informed of our acceptance of the scheme on these conditions.(iii) If and when the Secretary-General agrees to these conditions, immediate steps should be taken to select suitable British Observers. This should be done inthe first instance by a circular letter from the three Service departments to officers on their regular reserves, fifty names then being chosen from the best applicants.7. The Chiefs of Staff have been consulted and have expressed their agree-ment with these proposals.H. M.Foreign Office, S.W.1,11th June, 1951.
ANNEX . . .Reference:  AFS 251/9/01 United Nations,Lake Success, New York,* Uth June, 1950.The Secretary-General of the United Nations presents his compliments to theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the United Kingdom and has the honourto bring to his notice that, under General Assembly Resolution 297 (IV) B, dated22nd November, 1949, he was requested to establish and maintain a list of personsqualified to assist United Nations missions in the function of observation and super-vision, this list to be known as the United Nations Panel of Field Observers.2. In order to carry out the Special Committee&apos;s recommendations that the list should be based Upon the principle of equitable geographical distribution, itwould be appreciated if His Excellency&apos;s Government would forward to theSecretary-General fifty names of personnel whom he considers suitable for inclusionon this list with a brief description of the background of each man.3. Experience gained with United Nations missions in the field during the past three years indicates that officers of the rank of Major or Lieutenant-Colonel (or their equivalent rank in other services) on the active list are the most suitable. Theyshould be between thirty and forty-five years of age. Owing to the exigencies oftheir work in the field, it is not possible for wives and children to accompany them.4. The United Nations will consult His Excellency&apos;s Government beforerequesting the services of these officers when the need arises. They will be offered the following terms:  (a) The United Nations will reimburse the Government on request for theofficer&apos;s base salary plus all allowances to which he is entitled while serving in his home country. Any additional allowances which theGovernment makes for foreign service will be covered by a per diemallowance comparable to the allowances being paid to members of the secretariat serving on the same mission.(b) The officers will be covered by the social security provisions established forauxiliary personnel of the United Nations. A short summary of these provisions is attached.(c) The United Nations will be responsible for the cost of transportation fromthe place where the officer is stationed at the time of his secondment tothe mission and return to the place of recruitment or the place of hisnext appointment upon completion of service subject to the Secretariattravel regulations.(d) The officers will be allowed three days paid leave per month in additionto a maximum of ten national holidays of the country in which they are serving, Saturdays and Sundays are included in this leave since the dutiesof an observer entail a seven-day week.(e) The officers will be under the command of a Chief Observer who will beresponsible for the discipline and administration of the observationoperation. The Chief Observer will be a member of the Secretariat andwill be selected by the Secretary-General.(f) Officers will be assigned to missions for a period of one year or for the duration of the mission, whichever is the less.5. It is hoped that appropriate arrangements can be made to ensure thatseniority and other rights of officers who may be seconded to the United Nations for service as Observers on Missions will be in no way prejudiced as a result of suchsecondment and that due regard will be given in connexion with subsequent pro-motion to outstanding performance on the part of seconded personnel during their service with the United Nations. .6.  It is requested that names be forwarded at an early date.
