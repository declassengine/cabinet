Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1951CONFIDENTIALCP. (51) 16920th June, 1951CABINETLOW-COST housing memorandum by the Secretary of State for ScotlandHousing costs are rising in Scotland and the housing accounts of the majorityof local authorities are showing deficits. There is no prospect of the existing ratesof subsidy being increased and, while in some areas rents could no doubt be raisedstill further, there is obviously a limit to this remedy.2. In these circumstances I am anxious to give local authorities a lead in reducing housing costs. For this purpose I have been reviewing our own experience and examining the results of recent experiments undertaken in this country. Inaddition, however, I instructed my Parliamentary Under-Secretary responsible for housing, Mr. Fraser, to visit the Netherlands and study low-cost housing there.3. Accompanied by the Chief Accountant and Deputy Chief Architect of theDepartment of Health for Scotland, Mr. Fraser made this visit during the whitsun recess and he has now given me a most interesting report. I have sent copies ofthe full report to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Local Governmentand Planning and the Minister of Works. The purpose of this paper is to informmy colleagues of the action which I propose to take on the report and my otherenquiries into this subject.4. I am convinced that we can effect worth-while economies on our existinghousing plans without harm to the habitability and comfort of the houses from the tenants&apos; point of view. By doing so we shall be able to bring down housing costs,enable at least a proportion of houses to be let.at lower rents than would otherwise be the case, and without exceeding our capital investment for housing, probablysucceed in building more houses to meet the present shortage.5. I would propose to present the case in this way to local authoritiesexplaining, however, that there is no suggestion of forcing them to accept particulareconomies against their will and that my main concern is to point the way towards a solution of their present difficulties by the adoption of my suggested economiesor of other modifications in housing plans which they themselves may decide tomake.6. Mr. Fraser&apos;s report shows that the introduction of a special low-cost house in Holland, built to lower specifications and involving in some cases departures from local bye-laws, was followed by a general fall in the tender prices of normalhouses at a time when our costs were rising. Following is a note of some of themain features of Dutch houses with comments as to their suitability for Scotland:  (a) Room sizes. Apart from the living room, rooms in Dutch local authorityhouses are generally less than in Scotland. The third bedroom in a three-bedroomed house is, in many cases, only 54 square feet in area. InScotlandthe third bedroom is not less than 90 square feet. I propose toask local authorities to consider a reduction in the size of the third bed-room to about 70 square feet.40757Copy No. 3 1
ib) Cupboards. Less cupboard accommodation is provided than is ourcustom. I propose to try to have fewer cupboards accepted and to havea built-in wardrobe only in the smallest bedroom. (It is our experiencethat Scottish tenants are apt to buy full bedroom suites, including ward-robes, despite the provision of built-in cupboards.)(c) Fireplaces. Solid fuel fireplaces are not provided in any rooms but achimney vent is provided with an outlet to which an enclosed slowcombustion stove can be fitted in the living room. I do not wish tofollow the Dutch example in this respect and think that we shouldcontinue to provide a fireplace in the living room and one bedroom.(d) Bathrooms. No bathroom, as we know it, is provided. The Dutch providea wic. and a separate small compartment or &quot; lavette &quot; for bathing andclothes washing. The compartments are very small and bathing is byshower. The w.c. is provided normally in the centre of the house with no natural lighting, and ventilation is by open vent to the roof. Thereasons given for this siting of the w.c. are (i) that it is possible to reducethe overall area of the house in this way arid reserve outer walls andwindow space for other rooms; (ii) that it is possible to keep water and drainage pipes away from outer walls and so avoid frost damage and consequential costs; and (iii) that direct ventilation to the roof ismore efficient than window ventilation, especially as.in cold weatherthere is a tendency to keep windows closed. I propose to considerwhether a bathroom, complete with bath, w.c. and wash-hand basin inone compartment could be placed in the centre of the house especially for flats; or preferably whether a small compartment on the outsidewall just large enough to accommodate the w.c. and wash-hand basinwith a spray in an adjoining internal compartment would be a practicable alternative.(e) Hot water system.-A comprehensive hot water system as we know it isnot provided. Instead an Ascot-type heater is provided in the kitchenwith an automatic control from the hot water tap. Much plumbing iseliminated and there is considerable saving of scarce materials, e.g.,copper. I propose to ask my experts and the other Departments con-cerned to consider- further whether this is a practicable alternative toour normal hot-water system.(f) Kitchens. The Dutch kitchens are smaller than ours and negligiblecupboard accommodation is provided. Cookers and wash boilers arenot provided as part of the equipment of the house. I propose to con-sider following their example, except that I would not so drasticallyeliminate cupboard accommodation and equipment.7. There are some features in the Dutch building technique which I wish toconsider further. In the meantime I am having a model made of flats incorporatingmany of the above modifications and propose to invite local authorities, other interested bodies and four practical housewives to examine it and offer me their comments.H.
