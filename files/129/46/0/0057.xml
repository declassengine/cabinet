-r   278HIS DOCUMENT-IS THE-PROPERT-Y-O-F HIS BRITANNIC MA-JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT;confidential cp. (51) 20716TH JULY, 1951COPY NO,CABINETSERVICE RETIRED PAY AND PENSIONSMeraorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Minister of Defence has proposed in CP. (51) 203 increases in retired pay and pensions for senior officers (brigadiers and equivalentranks and above) which are larger than I have felt able to accept.Annex B of the Minister&apos;s paper shows the rates in question.Part of the case for increases in retired pay, as I understand it, has beenthat the pay increases of last autumn had upset the previous relativitiesbetween pay and retired pay.   I do not consider, nor I understand does theMinister of Defence, that there can or should be any fixed relativity betweenpay and retired pay, though I agree that as there has been an appreciablemovement in pay rates, the rates of retired pay fall to be considered.   but even on the basis of doing something to restore the relativities which obtained in 1946 (which must I suggest be considered reasonable) the proposals putforward by the Minister of Defence do more than restore those relativitiesand it is on this that I primarily base my objection.   Nor do I feel that thehigher rates proposed by the Minister of Defence, as compared with the alternatives which I favour, will make any difference to recruitment.The following table sets out the relative position.Percentage of Retired Pay (plus annuity value ofgratuity if any)  to Pay]		1950	Rank	1946	Service Ministers &apos;	Chancellor of		Proposal	Exchequer &apos;s			ProposalField Marshal	55	57	55General	51	56	52Lt.
