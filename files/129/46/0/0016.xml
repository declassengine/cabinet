4-&apos; WiZ/IhIS document is the property of his- britannic majesty&apos;s government)881lsecretcp.(51) 16619th june, 1951COPY NO.cabinetJAPANESE PEACE treaty memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 14th June the Cabinet agreed that the United Kingdom Govern-ment could join with the United States Government in publishing, as a basis for discussion with other Powers at war with Japan, a draft Peace treaty in the terms which had been agreed in the discussions with Mr, Dulles;and at the same time I informed my colleagues that they would have anopportunity to consider both the joint draft Treaty, and an explanatory memorandum which it was proposed should accompany it, before they were published (C.M.(5l) 43rd Conclusions, Minute 3).The Agreed Draft2. The agreed draft Treaty is based on the preliminary draft whichwas prepared during discussions in Washington in April and May(C.P.(51) 137, Annex A).    The differences in policy incorporated in thenew draft were all submitted to the Cabinet during the talks with Mr. Dullesin London and are in the sense of the Cabinefs decisions.    Some notesanalysing the differences between the latest agreed draft and its predecessorare attached (Annex A), and the draft itself is given in Annex b.3. Since the departure of Mr. Dulles, the draft Treaty has been con-sidered and agreed to at the official level by the Departments concerned.It is still subject to drafting changes of a minor nature.    The only out-standing point of importance is the proposed provision about shipping, onwhich we have had to reserve our position while the United States Govern-ment are investigating whether a voluntary declaration can be obtainedfrom the Japanese Government to meet our anxieties about a possiblerevival of the unfair practices previously used by the Japanese against british shipping.Future programme of work4. The draft Treaty is being submitted to the United States Govern-ment (as well as to His Majesty1 s Government) for covering approval in thecourse of this week.    (The draft covering memorandum referred to inparagraph 1 above is still under consideration by the United States Govern-ment, who do not expect to be able to comment on it for about a week.)Meanwhile Commonwealth Governments, who have been kept fully informed of the talks with Mr. Dulles, are being given a preliminary outline of thedraft itself.    If the draft is approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom and the United States Government, the Governments of theCommonwealth countries and other countries most closely concerned,including the Soviet Union (see paragraph 5 below) will be consultedofficially, and the draft Treaty will then be communicated to Governments
of other countries at war with Japan with a request for their commentsat the earliest possible moment.    The draft Treaty will also be published at an appropriate stage during this process.    On the above basis, theUnited States Government hope it may be possible to hold a conference to sign the Treaty in the middle of August, probably in San Francisco.5. The United States Government agree with our view that in this process it is important to treat Russia on the same basis as the other powers principally concerned, in so far as she   her self allows us to doso, and to continue to give her every opportunity of participating in thepeace settlement.    At the same time neither we nor the United StatesGovernment can accept the Soviet Governments contention, reiterated intheir Note of 10th June to the United States Government, that the prepara-tion of the Treaty must be entrusted to the Council of Foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Government and China.Our view has always been that on the contrary the Treaty should be pre-pared on a wide basis of consultation among the Powers concerned and thatin particular we could not agree to the exclusion of Commonwealth andother friendly Governments, including those of France and the Nether-lands, which would be involved by adopting the Soviet proposal.conclusion. If the United States Government accept Mr. Dulles&apos; recommen-dation not to proceed with their proposal for Nationalist participation inthe Treaty, this will represent a very important step to meet us.    the agreed draft contains other substantial United States concessions to ourview, made either in the recent discussions in London or in earlier stages of the negotiations, including the provision about the Congo BasinTreaties and the Article reaffirming japan s liability for her pre-war external debt.    The present agreed draft, compared with the originalUnited States draft of March last, represents an improvement beyond allrecognition, and roughly half of it has in fact been contributed by theUnited Kingdom.    When compared with the attitude too often shown byGeneral MacArthur towards our interests in the past, the fact that wehave thus been able, so far, to frame the peace settlement on terms of friendly equality with the United States, must be regarded as a very favourable development both in Anglo-American relations and as regardsour whole position in the Far East and the Pacific.    That it has beenpossible is largely due to the constructive and open-minded attitude ofMr. Dulles himself and in particular to his realisation of the importanceof our connections with the Commonwealth.We too have had to blocks concessions, particularly on the disposalof the Japanese gold,    The considered view of both sides has been that each must accept the need for maldng such concessions in view of the broader benefits to be secured from full Anglo-American agreement onTreaty problems.recommendation. I invite my colleagues to approve the revised draft of the Treaty(Annex B).H.M.Foreign Office, S.W.1,19TH JUNE, 1951.
ANNEX ANOTE OF CHANGES MADE IN THE LATEST DRAFT OF THE japanese peace TREATY AS A RESULT OF THE TALKS WITH MR. DULLES1. Trie references to Articles in this note are all to the Articles of the draftJapanese Peace Treaty dated 14th June (Annex B).2. The Preamble and Articles 23 to 27 have been re-drafted in conformitywith Mr. Dulles&apos; formula on China (CM. (51) 42rid Conclusions, Minute 1). TheTreaty now has no accession clause, so China&apos;will never be a party to the presentinstrument. Under Article 26, however, Japan undertakes to sign a separate peace treaty with any State at war with her which is not a signatory of the present Treaty.Article 2Apart from a rearrangement of the Article, two additions have been made toit. The first is that South Sakhalin and the Kuriles will now not be ceded to theSoviet Union (CM. (51) 41st Conclusions, Minute 4), and the second is that Japan will renounce her claims to Spratley Island and the Paracel Islands.Article 3This remains unchanged.Article 4.  (Article 5 of the draft Treaty in Annex A to CP. (51) 137 of 23rd Mayreferred to hereafter as &quot; the 23rd May draft.&quot;)The first three paragraphs of this Article have been re-drafted as paragraph (a).Paragraph (b) has been amended so that the first four words now read &quot; Japaneseowned submarine cables.&quot;Article 5.  (Article 6 of 23rd May draft.)Paragraph (b) is new. The paragraph was considered necessary in view ofArticle 107 of the United Nations Charter.Article 6.  (Article 7 of 23rd May draft.) this   is unamended.Article 7. (Article 8 of 23rd May draft.)Some venbal changes have been made in this Article but it is substantially unchanged.Articles. (Article 9 of 23rd May draft.)Paragraph (c) has been amended by the addition of the words &quot; and is dis-charged from all obligations resulting from &quot; in the first sentence.Article 9.  (Article 10 in 23rd May draft.)This Article has been re-drafted but remains substantially the same, except thatthe word &quot; limitation &quot; has been added after the word &quot; regulation.&quot; The UnitedKingdom position is still reserved on the desirability of a second paragraph. TheUnited States representatives have undertaken to see whether the Japanese Govern-ment is prepared to make a general declaration of their intention not to poach onconserved fisheries until the agreements mentioned in the Article are concluded. Ifsuch a declaration is forthcoming, it may be possible for His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the Commonwealth Governments to reconsider their attitude on the necessityfor a second paragraph.40750 &apos; B
2Article 10.  (Article 11 of 23rd May draft.)This Article has been expanded to include the substance of paragraph 1 ofArticle 11 of the United Kingdom draft. (Annex A to CP. (51) 104).Article 11.  (Article 12 of 23rd May draft.)The re-draft of this Article, proposed by the United States Government afterthe Washington talks, has been agreed. The phrase &quot; duly constituted Allied war crimes Courts &quot; now reads &quot; Allied War Crimes Courts.&quot;Article 12. (Article 13 of 23rd May draft.)The re-draft of this Article proposed by the United States Government afterthe Washington talks, has been accepted, except that (1) in paragraph (b) the period has been reduced to 4 years;(2) paragraph (e) has been omitted;(3) it has not been possible to reach agreement with the United States repre-sentatives to exclude shipping from the operation of paragraph (d), soHis Majesty&apos;s Governments position on this point is still reserved.Article 13.  (Article 14 of 23rd May draft.)The United States re-draft of this Article, proposed after the Washington talkshas been accepted. Paragraph (b) has, however, been re-drafted to make it clearerand the period has been reduced to 4 years.Article 14.  (Article 15 of 23rd May draft.)This Article has been extensively re-drafted.Paragraph (a) now states Japan&apos;s liabihty in principle to pay reparations;Paragraph (a) 1 provides for some kind of reparation for countries over-run by Japan during the war;Paragraph (a) 2 (I) has been amended by the addition of a special date for china;Paragraph (a)(2) (I) (v) has been added at the instance of the United states representatives.Paragraph (b) is new.Article 15.  (Article 16 of 23rd May draft.)This Article has been extensively amended but it has been agreed to drop the paragraphs dealing with insurance deposits and reserves and capital levies on allied nationals&apos; property in Japan. The former has been dropped on the express under-standing that Japan will give the Allied Powers satisfactory assurances outside theTreaty, and the latter on the understanding that if any cases of Allied nationalshaving hadto pay capital levies do come up they will be dealt with ad hoc.Article 16.This is a new Article which has been agreed in principle but the note requiresfurther Anglo-American discussion. The Article from the United Kingdom pointof view is also dependent on a satisfactory settlement of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentsspecial claims to certain Japanese Swiss franc balances. The United States repre-sentatives have undertaken to help in any way they can to bring about this settlementbefore a Peace Treaty is signed.Article 17.  (Article 17 of 23rd May draft.)This was unamended.-Article 18.   (Article 18 of 23rd May draft.)Paragraph 1 has been re-drafted at the instance of the United Kingdom. Thelast two lines of paragraph (b) have been shortened.Article 19.   (Article 19 of 23rd May draft.)Paragraph (b) has been amended and paragraph (c) made reciprocal in its application.Article 20. (Article 20 of 23rd May draft.)This Article remains unchanged.
