IMMUNITIES OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY organisation. The Lord Presidents Committee have been considering the privileges to be granted in this country to the North Atlantic treaty organisation and to persons associated with it.   A stage has been reached at which a Cabinet decision is required on certain outstanding issues.2. Some types of international organisation need various privileges,particularly, though not exclusively, in the countries in which either their headquarters or subsidiary offices are located, to enable them to carry ontheir work effectively.   This is recognised in this country by the international organisations (Immunities and Privileges) Act, 1950, under which Orders-in-Council may be made granting privileges and immunities, within limitsprescribed in the Act, to organisations and those associated with them.   TheOrders-in-Council require affirmative resolutions in both Houses.3. The grant of privileges - especially immunity from civil and criminal proceedings - offends against the general principle of Englishlaw that everyone living in this country should be subject to the ordinarycourts.   There are signs, duly reflected in Parliament, of growing publicdislike of extensive additions to a privileged caste of foreigners.   Thegrant of privileges can entail a denial of justice to those who are wrongedby the privileged individuals, though the Foreign Office claim that by takingthe matter up through the diplomatic channel they afford the victims a remedywhich is frequently more expeditious and less costly than litigation and hardlyever fails.4. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has its headquarters inLondon.   The other organisations in whose favour Order s-in-Council havealready been made may have subsidiary offices in London but their head&quot;quarters are elsewhere.   In addition to the Organisation^ own staff, each country will have a principal permanent representative (12 in all) and eachsuch permanent representative will have a fairly numerous staff of which the senior members have been estimated at 10 per country.5. In February last, the Foreign Secretary proposed, and the lord presidents Committee agreed, that the North Atlantic Treaty organisation should be accorded the scale of privileges already given in this country toO.E.E.C. and to the Specialised Agencies of the United Nations.   Broadlyspeaidngp this meant that the representatives would enjoy, while in thiscountry, immunity from arrest and detention, inviolability for their documents and baggage, and certain facilities in respect of customs and import duties;but they would be entitled to immunity from legal proceedings only in respectof things done in their official capacity.   They would not enjoy inviolabilityof residence and would receive a lesser exemption in respect of taxation.6. In subsequent discussions with the other countries concerned,the Foreign Office were not able to secure agreement on this limited basis.There was pressure for the permanent representatives to N.A.T.O. andtheir staffs and the two or three highest officials of the Organisation to be accorded the privileges which similar officials of and delegations to the united nations and to O.E.E.C. receive in the U. S.A. and France respectively where their headquarters are located, that is to say the same privileges as are accorded to diplomatic personnel of comparable rank.   The Foreign Office are,however, likely to be able to induce other governments to agree that temporaryrepresentatives should have a lower scale of immunity than permanent representatives.   The draft agreement which has been prepared places each
\member state under an obligation to waive the immunity of all its representatives and staffs &quot;where in its opinion the immunity would impede the cause of justice and can be waived without prejudice to the purpose forwhich the immunity is accorded. &quot;The Foreign Secretary accordingly asked the Lord presidents committee to agree that the principal permanent representatives frommember states and the two or three highest officials of the organisation should enjoy full diplomatic immunity, while resident members of the staffof permanent representatives would enjoy nearly full diplomatic immunity.Temporary representatives, together with their advisers and technical experts, would enjoy a more restricted type of immunity.   The lord presidents Committee had a brief discussion of the issues involved on 9th May, but there has been some disagreement about the decision which theCommittee reached.7. Since there is general agreement that the individuals concerned should enjoy immunity in respect of acts done in their official capacity,what is at issue is (a) whether principal permanent representatives of member states should enjoy immunity from civil and criminal proceedings in respectof things done in their private capacity, inviolability of residence, and the wide privileges in respect of direct taxation given to Ambassadors,(b) whether the resident members of the staffs of these representatives should enjoy a similar immunity from legal proceedings and most of the taxation reliefs given to the principal permanent representatives and(c) whether the two or three highest officials of the Organisation should enjoy immunity from legal proceedings and inviolability of residence, but notaxation relief save in respect of their official salaries and emoluments.As regards (c), the highest officials of practically all important international organisations for which Orders-in-Council have been made under the 1950 Actor similar legislation are given these immunities.8. Obviously the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is of thehighest importance and the Government place great store on adherence tothe decision that the headquarters of the Organisation should be located inLondon.   Nevertheless, if we go as far as the Foreign Secretary wishes inplacating the opinion of our allies, we may have some difficulty in securingParliamentary approval to the necessary Order-in-Council.   Full immunityis being sought by other countries because they consider that (a) the lowerscale of immunities proposed by the United Kingdom, (which does not include,for instance, inviolability of office premises of delegations) is in their viewinadequate for the fulfilment of their functions, [b) as a matter of courtesy theUnited Kingdom ought to grant to permanent representatives to N.A.T,0.and their staffs in London the same scale of immunity as that granted tosuch representatives to the United Nations and their staffs in New York andto representatives of O.E.E.C. and their staffs in Paris, and (c) for political reasons N.A.T.O, should not be given worse treatment in this respect thanthe United Nations and O.E.E.C. receive in the countries in which their headquarters are located.   It is pointed out that the United Kingdom is a party to the O.E.E.C. Protocol on Privileges and Immunities;  and, in theUnited Nations General Assembly, not only voted in favour of the Agreementbetween the United Nations and the United States Government under whichprivileges and immunities are granted to representatives to the united nations in New York, but played a prominent part in securing its adoption,9, We went a certain way in granting immunities in this countryto persons connected with O.E.E.C. and the Specialised Agencies.  Now we are asked to grant much more extensive privileges to a considerable number ofpersons connected with N.A.T.O. who are permanently resident in London,
The general trend is, therefore, towards giving wide privileges to more andmore individuals.   In addition to the difficulty of securing parliamentary approval to the necessary Order-in-Council, precedents are being createdwhich will make it difficult to deny similar privileges to later international organisations which have their headquarters in this country.At some stage, we shall have to oppose the spread of privilegesbeyond what we regard as justifiable.   The Cabinet ought, therefore, toconsider whether we should tai^e a stand on the present occasion, notwith-standing the importance to us of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation,because if we give way now it will not be easy to be firm on a later occasion.On this basis we should give those associated with N.A.T.O, immunity fromsuit and process in respect of official acts, but not full diplomatic immunity,and in particular not immunity from civil and criminal proceedings in respectof things done in a private capacity.10. Officers of the Departments concerned have examined in whatways the disadvantages of granting the wide privileges sought by foreign powers might be mitigated by administrative means, if it were felt that thegrant of these fuller privileges was unavoidable.   They have proposed thatthe Foreign Secretary would make it clear to other signatories to the draft agreement that this country: -(i)  would always press for waiver of immunity in criminal cases;(ii)  would insist that the arrangement under which members of the diplomatic Corps take out third party motor insurance policies should beextended to N.A.T.O. representatives and officials;(iii)  wou d only grant inviolability of his private house to the principalpermanent representative of each country, and not to his staff or to temporary representatives;(iv)  would wish to exercise an effective discretion as to the number ofthe staff of a representative who would enjoy the wider immunities.It would also be desirable that the Foreign Secretary, in presenting thedraft Order-in-Council for Parliamentary approval, should be able to give an undertaldng that the Government would take all practicable steps to minimise the inconvenience which these concessions might entail to other persons in this country, e.g. in deserving cases would pay compensation to wronged individuals, even if the country concerned declined to refundthe cost,11. It is accordingly suggested that the Cabinet should decide:-(a) whether to inform other signatories to the North Atlantic Treaty thatwe cannot agree to the grant of full diplomatic privileges to (i) permanent representatives to N.A.T.O. and their resident staffs, or (ii) the highestofficials, but must confine these immunities to things done in an officialcapacity, or(b) if the wider privileges are to be acceded, whether the administrativesafeguards outlined in paragraph 10 above should be insisted upon.1ST JUNE, 1951
