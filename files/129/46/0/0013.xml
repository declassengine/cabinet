lift OL 8-&apos;779THIS DOCUMENT IS THE-PROPERTY OF-HIS B-RiTANN-IG-MA-JESTY*S GOVERNMENT)confidential cp.(51) 163J.5TH JUNE, 1 -.51COPY NO:abinetLEASEHOLD PROPERTY (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) bill memorandum by the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-general we should li^e our colleagues to consider what to do about the lords amendments to this Bill, which are to be taken in the Commons onWednesday,    Two changes of substance in Part I (ground leases) weremade against our will in the Lords.    If the Commons disagree, the Lordsare unlikely to acquiesce but will probably offer a compromise.    If they take this course, we cannot get Royal Assent by 24-th June (Quarter Day).2. The chief reason for wanting Royal Assent by then is that other-wise some shop tenancies -will, as the Bill stands, lose the benefit of part II of the Bill (which is non-controversial).    If Royal Assent is not delayedmore than a wee-s. or so we might alter the Bill to make Part II retro-spective.    This would require some half dozen fairly simple amendments.But if the delay is too long those amendments will not work.    A secondreason for having Royal Assent before 24th June is that the Bill is expressed to come into operation ontbat day because we accepted an opposition amendment in the Lords to that effect.3. The question arises, therefore, whether we make certain of royal assent before 24th June by offering compromises on Wednesday, riskingcriticism from our supporters in the Commons, or whether we disagreeon Wednesday and see what happens in the Lords when the Bill goes backon Thursday,    If we tale the first course, we must give notice on Monday,18th June,4. The first hostile amendment is to Clauses 1 and 2 (which extendground leases of residential property where the lessee is in occupation by himself or his family).    Clause 1 covers leases expiring after thecommencement of the Bill, Clause 2 leases already expired where the lessee is holding over.    As the Bill left the Commons it did not require ajnyqualifying period of occupation before the lease came to an end, so long asthe lessee or a member of his family was in residence immediately before that time.    The Lords amendment provides that such residence must havebeen continuous since introduction (20th November, 1950).5. The main case for the Lords amendment was that it cut out the lessee who is really an investor and who manages to get into residence just before the end of the lease.    This is an undeserving case, but not a very likely one.    We had already provided in the Commons that a lessee whohad got an extension would lose it by assigning or by sub-letting the wholehouse.    The amendment would cut out many deserving cases and we aresatisfied that it must be resisted.    We are also satisfied that no formulacan be found to cut out all undeserving cases and no others.
6. We believe that the Opposition in the Lords would be satisfied, sofar as Clause 1 is concerned, with a qualifying period of two months&apos;residence by the lessee or his family between introduction and the expiry of the lease.    This is really only a face-saver.    It does little harm from our point of view (though we can imagine deserving cases which it would cut out) but when analysed it does very little to meet the real point of the lords amendment.    As for Clause 2, the Opposition have not indicated anycompromise, and we do not see any which would work.7. The second amendment is to Clause 5.    This clause fortifies theprotection given by Clauses 1 and 2 by preventing the landlord fromenforcing the repairing covenants (whether by forfeiture or by action for damages) during the term of the lease as extended by Clause 1 or Clause2.    Clause 6 (inserted in the Commons) enables the landlord in cases of serious disrepair to enter the property and do the repairs himself, but does not allow him to forfeit the lease or to recover the cost of the repairsuntil the lease comes to an end.&amp;. The Lords amendment substitutes an adaptation of the LeaseholdProperty (Repairs) Act, 1938.    We are satisfied that this must be resisted because it gives the tenant quite inadquate protection.    The corn-promise which, we understand, would be acceptable to the Opposition isthat if the state of the property is so bad that the local authority serves anenforcement notice on the tenant under the Housing Act or the PublicHealth Acts, and, on the failure of the tenant to comply with that notice, the landlord finds himself obliged to pay the cost of the work, the landlordshould have the right to recover the cost from the tenant immediately andto forfeit the tenancy if the tenant fails to pay.    Thus, under the Bill as itleft the Commons, the landlord is in all cases required to wait until theend of the lease before he can recover from the tenant;  while under the suggested compromise the tenant can be forced to pay immediately or be turned out if the local authority says the state of the house is bad enough.9. In this situation, which raises points of political tactics and of therelations between the two Houses, we ask our colleagues to decide whether -(a) we should in the Commons offer a compromise on either or both ofthese Lords amendments, or (b) we should hold firm and consider thesituation again when we know for certain how the Lords react on Thursdayto a simple disagreement by the Commons.J.F.S.15th June, 1951.
