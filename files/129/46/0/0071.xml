-   3i5rHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETG.P.(51) 221 COPY NOv20TH JULY, 1951CABINETo ATHE FUTURE OF THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT and national ARBITRATION order memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service in CP. (51) 8 the then Minister of Labour and National Servicedrew attention to certain practical difficulties which had arisen in theadministration of the Conditions of Employment and National ArbitrationOrder and indicated various possible methods of dealing with them.   Heconcluded by saying that he proposed to seek the advice of the Joint Consul&quot;tative Committee of the National Joint Advisory Council on the whole matterand to report back to his colleagues as soon as possible.2. In the subsequent discussions which my predecessor and I havehad with the Joint Consultative Committee, the representatives of the TradesUnion Congress (T. U. C. ) made it quite clear that they were not prepared toagree to the continuance of the present Order for more than a very short time, but that they would welcome a new Order preserving some of the existing provisions so long as it did not contain any form of penal sanction directed against strikes.   The attitude of the employers1 representatives was that thewithdrawal of the present restrictions on strikes and lockouts would, in their view, be inopportune, but that if the Government felt that these could no longer be retained they were prepared to consider proposals for a new Order on theunderstanding that it was to be experimental and that the position would be reviewed at any time on the request of either side.   (This is the same conditionupon which the agreement of the two sides of industry was obtained to thecontinuance of the existing Order at the end of the war. )3. Accordingly, I put forward heads of proposals for a new Orderin place of the existing one and these have now been accepted by the Committee.The main differences between the new proposals and the present Order areas follows(a) The prohibition of strikes and lock-outs would be entirelyremoved.(b) The scope of the Order would be confined to disputes concerningwages and conditions of employment and would exclude disputes arising from such matters as the employment of non-unionists and claims for re-instatement.Experience has shown that such matters are not susceptible of settlement bycompulsory arbitration.(c) &quot;Compulsory arbitration&quot; - in the sense of one party to a dispute being able to take the other party to arbitration even against their will -would be retained and a tribunal lite the present National Arbitration tribunal would continue to function as at present, though under a different name, butthe right to report disputes would be limited on the one hand to employersand employers&apos; organisations and on the other to trade unions as defined inthe Trade Union Act, 1913.   This would exclude trade union branches acting
without the authority of their union, groups of unorganised workers and alsoprofessional associations whose principal objects are not the regulation of therelations between workmen and masters or any of the other statutory objectsreferred to in Section 1(2) of the Trade Union Act, 1913.   Furthermore, in thecase of trades or industries with voluntary machinery for dealing with wagesand conditions, a valid report could only be made by the parties habituallytaking part in that machinery so that in practice unrecognised or break-awayunions would be excluded.   The general effect of these provisions is tostrengthen existing voluntary machinery in industry.Where there is no such voluntary machinery in operation, a validreport of a dispute may be made by the employer concerned or by anemployers1 organisation or a trade union having a substantial proportion ofemployers or workers in the trade or part of the trade concerned.(d) Awards under the Industrial Courts Act and settlements reachedthrough voluntary machinery would be treated as constituting a final settlementof a dispute for the purposes of the Order;  in other words, a dispute whichhad already been the subject of an agreement or arbitration could notsubsequently be dealt with under the provisions of the Order.(e) The Minister would not be obliged to refer a dispute to theTribunal (or might, if he had already referred it, stop the Tribunal fromhearing it) if it appeared to him that either party was taking coercive actionresulting in a stoppage of work or in a substantial breach of an agreementbetween the parties.(f) Part III of the existing Order - which imposes upon all employersan obligation to observe recognised terms and conditions of employment (orterms and conditions not less favourable) - would be abolished, but an organisation of employers or a trade union which habitually takes part in thesettlement of terms and conditions of employment in the industry or section ofindustry concerned would be able to report an issue as to whether a. particularemployer should observe recognised terms and conditions, and the Tribunalmight require the employer to observe such terms and conditions (or such asit might determine to be not less favourable).(g) In addition to the points which arise on the draft circulated here with, it is proposed to insert an additional paragraph in the draft Orderspecifically excluding from its scope members of the Fire Brigades maintained in pursuance of the Fire Service Act, 1947.   The terms and conditions of themembers of the Fire Brigades are regulated in detail by regulations made under that Act by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland, and anyattempt to use the arbitration tribunal set up by the Order to deal with those terms and conditions of service would create an embarrassing conflict of jurisdiction.   One or two attempts have been made to refer questions affectingthese services to the National Arbitration Tribunal under the present Order,and in view of this it is desirable to make a specific exclusion.4. I have been asked by the representatives of the nationalised industries to make another change in the new Order as compared with the oldOrder.   This concerns the establishment of a Tribunal in accordance with theFirst Schedule to the Order, and I have been asked to provide here that theMinister in appointing the panels from which the Tribunal is to be constitutedshould consult the Nationalised Boards as well as the British Employers&apos;Confederation (B.E. C.) and the T. U. C.   At first sight there is something to be said for this request.   The Nationalised Boards are independentlyrepresented on the National Joint Advisory Council and its Sub-Committee,the Joint Consultative Committee, which has been advising me on the questionof amending the existing Order.   While, however, it is necessary to obtain
the views of the nationalised industries on major questions of government policy in the industrial field, it does not follow that they should be consulted on all occasions in the same way as I coiisult the B.E. C. and the T. U. C.The Nationalised Boards are employers and on this kind of question their position is no different from that of large private employers such as I, C.I.If statutory provision were made for consulting the Nationalised Boards, weshould inevitably be faced with requests for similar consultation with theLocal Authorities, I. C.I. , Unilevers, etc.   Moreover, under the provisionsof the Order disputes in industries with well organised voluntary machinerywill not normally come to the Tribunal at all since the settlement of disputes by the machinery of those industries is to be regarded as final forthe purposes of the Order.   It does not seem, therefore, that the nationalised industries will have much concern in practice with the working of the Tribunal,and this is an added reason for refusing their request.   I feel we should hesitatevery much before beginning to place the Nationalised Boards on a level withthe Confederation representing all organised private employers.   i accordingly do not propose to make any change in the Schedule to the Order.5, The satisfactory operation of a.n Order of this sort depends,of course, upon its ready acceptance by both sides of industry.   It is quite clear, therefore, that in view of the attitude of the T. U. C. the present Orderwill have to be revoked in the near future and that its penal provisionscannot be continued in any fresh Order.   In any case, it is my view - whichI understand the Attorney-General shares - that these provisions have outlivedtheir usefulness and have become a serious embarrassment in presentcircumstances.   On the other hand, the existing Order contains much that isuseful and has proved a most valuable means of reinforcing the voluntarynegotiating machinery of industry.   I consider that the proposals which havebeen accepted by the Joint Consultative Committee retain what is useful inthe present Order while going some way towards meeting the variousdifficulties set out in CP. (51) 8.6. Accordingly I propose to make a new Order immediately onthe lines indicated above and to lay it before Parliament at once so as toallow opportunity for discussion before the House rises.   A copy of thedraft Order is attached.   In accordance with the undertaking which I havealready given to the Joint Consultative Committee the Order would be on an experimental basis.A.R.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.
