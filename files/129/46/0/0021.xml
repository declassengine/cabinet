pOCWMENT IS THE PROFER-T^f-OF-KIS BRITANNIC -MA JEST^IS GOVERNMENT)rnN FIDE NT IA Lr,.P.(51)171 &quot; COPY NO. 31*2ND JUNE, 1951V CABINET; SUPPLEMENTARY PENSIONS FOR MINERS* &quot; Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power&apos;The National Union of Minewprkers (N.U.M.) and the national coal Board (N.C.B.) have been most anxious to ensure that the Miners&apos;Pensions Scheme should be established under-the National Insurance Actso that it can be made a compulsory scheme - involving the deduction ofthe men&apos;s contributions from their wages - without infringing the TruckActs.The point came up at Cabinet on 11th June and the Cabinet&quot;agreed the scheme should be mandatory upon all workers coming within its scope&quot; (C.M.(51) 42hd Conclusions, Minute 4).2, The Minister of National Insurance has told me that she does notinfect feel that the Cabinet&apos;s decision implies that the miners1 scheme should be established under the National Insurance Act.    Her view isthat- ...(i) The procedure of the National Insurance Act involves an - . affirmative resolution of both Houses, and it would be .. . difficult politically for the Government to seek parliamentary approval of the scheme, particularly in view of the decisionto extend it to surface workers, against the background oftheir general policy on supplementary pensions. -(ii) Compulsion could be secured in other ways; and the Cabinetby &quot;mandatory&quot; meant no more than that membership ofthe scheme would be a specific term of each&quot;worker&apos;scontract of service.V        The N.U.M. are virtually obliged to mate an announcement aboutpensions at their Annual Conference which starts on 2nd July; and theN.C.B. have therefore very little time left to clear up outstanding points.I have no alternative, therefore, but to bring the matter again before theCabinet.. -A     -  I have proposed that an Order should be made under the national insurance Act, because, short of introducing new legislation, there is noother way in which the Cabinet&apos;s decision can be carried out. .&apos;        The suggestion of the Minister of National Insurance that membership of the scheme should be made a condition of each wprker*scontract of service with the N.C.B. provides, I am afraid, no solution,is obviously not practicable for the N.C.B. to Sack employees who do
not pay their contributions, or to sue them&quot;in the Courts,    They mustbe able to deduct the contributions from wages.    But I have been advised - and this is.the crux of the matter - that in the absence of anOrder under the National Insurance Act, the Truck Acts make it unlaw- .fol for deductions to be made, unless the employees give a signedauthorisation. &apos;&quot;-v --$ The N.U.M. and the N.C.B. are of opinion, and I am sure theyare right, that a large number of eligible men might refuse to sign.They think that many men might delay joining, until either advancing age or family responsibilities made the prospect of a pension attractiveenough to overcome the disinclination to pay contributions.    But wide-spread abstention would knock the bottom out of the whole scheme andwould in eny case deprive it altogether of its potentially great prestigevalue.   . &apos; &apos;     .&apos;&quot;V7, If the Enen postponed joining the scheme until they were ofmature age, they would not, when it came to the point, be satisfied witha pension reduced on that account.:   In the end, tierc would be over-whelming pressure to make the scheme universal and non-contributory.Put bluntly, the effective choice is be^between;^ making the young men in theindustry contribute towards their pensions or leaving the whole burdento be borne by the employer.8, For their own purposes the N.U.M. attach great importance tothe scheme being made compulsory, and a copy of a statement they madeon this subject, when they came to see me last week, is appended.9.        I ask the Cabinet to confirm their earlier decision that the scheme should be made compulsory and that this should be achieved by means ofan Order under Section 2.7 Of the National Insurance Act.    I add thatSectioriZ? was specially designed to male it possible compulsorily todeduct from wages the contributions required for supplementary schemesof this kind, and thus to get round the provisions of the Truck Acts.F.J.N.-B.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.V/.1,22ND JUNE, 1951.
annex extract FROM STATEMENT BY NATIONAL-UNION OF MINEWORKERSA third point; to which we have to refer is one which only emergedduring the last fortnights   We are informed thai there is Governmentalobjection tc^theScheme being made compulsory for all those eligible tojoin it,, on the grounds of Parliamentary difficulties. *We are a^jjare thatthe Scheme can either be brought in as a Supplementary Scheme underSection 27 of the National Insurance Act or as an Agreement-similar to the(Joint Fatal Accident Scheme. &apos; The first method would.require the approvalof the Minister of National Insurance and be laid Before Parliament, . Thesecond method requires only the approval of the Minister of Fuel and Prayer.,We understand that the&quot; Minister of National Insurance objects to the firstcourse being taken oh the grounds of Parliamentary difficulties and con-aiders that we should be able to organise the deduction of contributionsalong similar lines to those which were applied to the Fatal Accident Scheme..It should be pointed out, however, that there are some differences in respect of both these Schemes.    It is one thing to secure agreement forthe deduction of Id per week from the employee when all employees undergo a similar risk of injury or death irrespective of age.    It is quite another matter to secure voluntary consent from a young person to the deduction ofIs. 6d per week, which is the proposed contribution to the SupplementaryPension Scheme, when he can only possibly secure any benefits for periods of service and contribution of 40 years.    The Scheme would be quite .unworkable if it were voluntary and the National Coal 3oard completely agreewith this view.    The younger men and new entrants would hot easily be attracted and this v/ould enormously increase the cost to those who do wishto enter the Scheme. . v-There is the additional difficulty that men might enter or leave theScheme from time to time during their working life in the industry and this .would create an impossible administrative situation and would be disastrousfrom a financial point of view.:   Variations in the amounts of the ultimatepensions due to intermittent contributions by individuals would be bound tocreate great discontent. . : - :;We do not consider that the tactical purely Parliamentary positionis a good reason to explain the creation of difficulties which can destroy thesupport and the financial stability of the Scheme.    The compulsory principlehas been accepted in big pension schemes affecting teachers^ workers in local government, etcetera.    The Colliery Workers&apos; Supplementary Scheme,which calls for the payment from the worker of 4d per week, is a compulsoryScheme which was carried through under Section 83 of the Industrial InjuriesAct.   We have experienced very little difficulty in the industry arising fromthe compulsory character of the Scheme and we must therefore urge that tobe effective the Supplementary Pension Scheme must be of a compulsory&quot;character./&apos;. &apos; &apos; &quot; - .   . .-&apos; -We urge you and your colleagues in the Government to seriouslyconsider the matters which I have placed before you in the name of and inthe presence of a unanimous National Executive Committee of the National      :-Union of itfineworkers.        .    -: ;&apos;;-:.&apos;.Finally, we urge you to expedite the settlement of these matters sottat we may meet the National Coal Board, we hope during next week, so thatttey can be.authorised to enter into a settlement which we can submit to ourAnnual Conference in the week commencing 2nd July, 1951.
