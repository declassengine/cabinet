THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT,CONFIDENTIAL*3 1CP. (51) 204 copy NO. **23RD JULY, 1951&quot;&apos;&quot;&quot; CABINETMERCHANDISE b/h.Ri&apos;SMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade the Board of Trade has had under consideration for some timecertain proposals for the amendment of Merchandise Marks legislation, forthe removal of obvious anomalies and defects in the present Acts and to giveadditional protection to the customer against false or misleading markingor description of goods.   They represent a tidying up of the present law, nowoverdue, rather than the introduction of a set of new principles of legislation and administration.   They could, therefore, be presented as a normal piece of departmental legislation.2, The following is an outline of the proposals:-(a,- At the moment the Merchandise Marks Act covers misdescriptiorionly in the relatively limited meaning of &quot;false trade description&quot; as relatingbroadly (Clause 3 of the 1S87 Act, &apos;to the number, quantity, measure, gaugeor weight, the origin, the mode of manufacture, or the material,&quot; of thegoods concerned.   It therefore does not clearly cover such qualities aselectrical resistance, resistance to shrinkage or fading or v/ear, and so on,which may all be important in determining the value of an article on sale.   Theresult is that misrepresentation of these qualities, whether by actualdescription or, say, by a misleading reference to a British Standard Speci-fication which may specify them, is not an offence.   I propose, therefore, toextend the meaning of the term &quot;trade description&quot; to correspond with that used in the Trade Marks Act in defining the characteristics which may be related to a certification trade mark, namely, to cover &quot;origin, material,mode of manufacture, quality, accuracy or other characteristic. &quot;This amendment would incidentally also provide a second lineof attack in the case of the misuse of a certification trade mark based on thequality specification.   My predecessor developed elsewhere (P.C(49, 18;a proposal that industry should be encouraged to use such marks for the regulation of the quality of its own produce, and action in this direction isbeing pursued through administrative channels and by the British standards institution.(b, To strengthen the Act in two ways to remove some of its defectsin dealing with descriptions applied to goods for sale:-(a)  At present &apos;ifalse description&quot; would not bite on a case in which thewords used on or about the article were not completely falsein the sense of being capable of bearing only a false meaning,but were misleading in the sense that while they could bear a true meaning they were so phrased that the first and mostobvious interpretation was false.   I should, therefore, proposeto amend the term &quot;false description&quot; to include &quot;misleadingdescription&quot;.
(ii)  Secondly, I propose to ma.;o misleading formats, pictures,arrangements of words, and so cn, an offence, so that forinstance a trader could not avoid a conviction by showing that &quot;spliced heels and toes&quot; appeared in minute lettersunderneath NYLON STOC..1INGS, or that in a bottle covered withtartans and Scotch mists there is no reference in words toScotch Whisky. *(c) To take powers to require definite classes of goods to be markedwith their makers1 names.   This proposal springs immediately from thediscussions last summer with the Furniture Development Council, the result ofwhich was announced in Parliament.   I intend that these pc vers shall takethe form that, if the President of the Board of Trade is satisfied that it is inthe public interest, makers&apos; names shall be marked on a specified class ofgoods and the Px-esident shall be empowered by Order to make it an offencefor any of these goods to be sold or held for sale or for any purpose of trade or manufacture unless they bear the makers&apos; names.   Before I decided thatany such Order should be made, I should require to be satisfied not only thatsuch a marking would act as a valuable stiinulus to manufacturers for themaintenance of quality but also that, given the structure of the manufacturing and retail trades concerned, it would be practicable to identify a singlemanufacturer and to make the labelling requirement stick.(d) The present penalties under the Act were fixed in 1887 and havemaxima on summary conviction of  20 for a first offence and  50 for asecond offence, with alternative appropriate terms of imprisonment andforfeiture of the goods concerned.   I propose, so as to bring these monetarypenalties more into line v/ith the change in value of money, to raise thesemaxima to  50 for the first offence and  100 for the second offence.3. Before I presented a Bill drafted on these lines, I should want to arrange discussions with appropriate bodies in industry.   Much of the content of such a Bill would be based on work done and recommendations made by theMarks Committee of the British Standards Institution which in itself includesrepresentatives of various industrial bodies, so that the matter might be suffiently covered by discussions with this Committee.   But I should haveto consider whether it would be necessary to approach any other bodies,particularly on the trading side.   I believe that these proposals would win aconsiderable measure of agreement and the Bill could be regarded as largelynon-contentious.The proposals have received the approval of the distribution and Marketing Committee and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury is satisfied that the staff required for the task is very limited.   I now ask mycolleagues1 approval for the introduction of a Merchandise Marks amendment bill incorporating the provisions set out above.H.S.Board of Trade, S. W. 1. ,23RD JULY, 1951.
