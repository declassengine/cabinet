(51) 1956th July, 1951CABINETDESPATCH OF CABINET AND CABINET COMMITTEE business during THE SUMMER HOLIDAYNote by the Prime minister it is my wish that during the first six weeks of the Recess (from 4th august to 15th September) there should be as few Ministerial meetings as possible.Meetings of the Cabinet may be required to deal with urgent questions arising fromdevelopments in the international situation; but I propose that no meetings of standing Ministerial Committees should be held during this period and that theCabinet itself should not be asked to deal with any business on which decisions canbe taken before the end of the Session or deferred until the second half ofSeptember.2. I therefore ask all Ministers to consider at once whether there are any matters on which they will have to obtain decisions from the Cabinet or from aCabinet Committee before the middle of September, and to make every effort tobring these matters forward for consideration before the end of July.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S.W. 16th July, 1951
