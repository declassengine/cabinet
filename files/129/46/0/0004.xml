$IS-DOCUMENT-IS THE PROPERTY O-F HIS BRITANNIC-MAJESTY-JS-GO-V-ERNMENT)confidential cp.(51) 1547TH JUNE, 1951COPY NO.   MCABINETSUPPLEMENTARY PENSIONS FOR MINERSRESTRICTION TO UNDERGROUND workers memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and PowerWhen on the 18th January the Cabinet agreed in principle toa supplementary pension scheme for mineworkers they stipulated that itshould be restricted to underground workers (CM. (51) 2nd Conclusions).2. The National Union of Mineworkers (N. U. M.) have opposedthis restriction and the Executive of the Union have now asked to come and see me about it.3. I understand that Mr. Horner and Mr. Ernest Jones have said in the hearing of the National Coal Board (N. C. B.) negotiatorsthat the N. U. M. Executive cannot face their July Conference without atleast having been to see a Minister.   As my colleagues are aware,Mr. Ernest Jones explained the N. C.B&apos;s proposals with complete candour toa delegate conference of the Union in York on the 17th January, emphasisingthat they would restrict the scheme to underground workers.   But itappears that the pressure from the Union Membership has been very strong,and I have received representations that the Union leaders cannot success-fully resist this pressure.4. There is one class of surface worker worthy of special consideration, those who once served underground but for reasons beyond their control (accident, disease, old age) have had to be moved to the surface.   They are more than half of all the surface workers and I think we have all recognised that it would be necessary to do something specialfor them.   This, however, should not now be in issue.   The N.C.B. have proposed - and the Treasury have agreed&quot;- that workers moved to the surface, either after serving underground for sixteen years or because of injury or disease, should be regarded as &quot;underground workers&quot; and go onearning pension though at a somewhat reduced rate.   The N, U. M. know that this has been approved in principle, and it only remains to work outthe details in negotiation between themselves and the National Coal Board.5. Nevertheless, the Union argue that it is invidious to distinguish between the different categories of mineworker, and they may pray in and the  Colliery Workers Supplementary Scheme for injuries, which, with government approval, applies to all mineworkers whether employed under-ground or on the surface.   The present deadlock between the Governmentand the T. U. C. on the question of an enquiry into pension schemes for industry generally is, of course, another complication.
6. I do not think that it would be politically advisable torefuse to see the N. U. M. Executive,   I have to give statutory approval to any scheme agreed between the Union and the Board, and it was on thebasis of my statutory responsibility that I indicated to the Coal board that I would not be prepared to approve a scheme which included the concessions which the Union now wishes to discuss.   In spite of mystatutory position, however, it might be thought undesirable to agree to a discussion which might, in effect, be taken to mean the transference of thenegotiations from their present level to one between the Union and theGovernment direct.   I myself feel that notwithstanding this difficulty,it would be out of the question to refuse to see the Union.   If there is to bea meeting I suggest it would be useful if other Ministers who areconcerned, including the Minister of National Insurance, attended and helped to explain the Governments policy on supplementary pensions and thedifficulties about the extension proposed by the N. U. M.7. The N. U. M. tell me that they also wish to discuss thedecision that ill-health and widows&apos; pensions under the new scheme shouldnot be paid on top of the pensions already payable under the national insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act and the Colliery Workers1 SupplementaryInjuries Scheme.   This was a decision of the S. I. (M) Committee whoaccepted a recommendation on this point of a working party of officials(S. I. (M)(51) 3rd Meeting and S. I. (M)(5l) 12).8. I invite the Cabinet -(i) to agree that the N. U. M. Executive should be seen by a minister or Ministers;(ii) to consider the line to be taken with the Union;(iii) to consider whether other Ministers concerned with the questionsof national policy involved should not help to explain the difficulties of the extensions proposed by the Union,P. J.N-B.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S. W. 1,,7TH JUNE, 1951.
