1 MwVs * v ^     151IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA-ESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential cp.(51) 178 COPY NO.   3J26TH JUNE, 1951CABINETMIGRATION POLICY:  ASSISTED PASSAGEAGREEMENT WITH AUSTRALIAMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth relations in C.P.(50) 306 of 12th December, 1950, I raised the questionwhether or not we should extend the existing Assisted Passage Agreementwith Australia which was due to expire on 30th March, 1951.    Myrecommendation was that we should not renew the Agreement.2. This question was considered by the Cabinet on 18th December(G.Ivi.(50) 87th Conclusions, Minute 3; and it was agreed that a decision should be deferred pending discussions which I was invited to have withthe Prime Minister of Australia, Mr. Menzies, when he came to london for the meet in.  of Commonwealth Prime Ministers in January.3. I duly discussed the question with Mr. Menzies and at his sugges-tion it was agreed that no action should be taken to terminate the Agree-ment until the Australian Minister for Immigration, Mr. Holt, had beenable to come to London to discuss the matter further with me.    It was thenhoped that it would be possible for Mr. Holt to come over before theAgreement expired but owing to the General Election in Australia this proved to be impossible.    It was therefore agreed between the twoGovernments that the Agreement should be extended for six months andthat Mr. Holt should come to London as soon as possible after the election to hold the necessary discussions.4. I have now received a message from Mr. Menzies explaining thatMr. Holfs duties in Parliament will make it impossible for him to leaveAustralia for the next few months and stating that he has therefore arranged for these discussions to be conducted by the Acting High Commissioner for Australia, Mr. McCarthy.5. I propose to open the negotiations with the Acting High Commissioneralmost immediately and I should be glad to have the Cabinet&apos;s authority for conducting them on the following lines:-I would begin by emphasising that, as I have more than once publicly stated, our firm policy is to facilitate and encouragemigration from the United Kingdom to other commonwealth countries.    We recognise that the solidarity and strength of theCommonwealth depends on the outflow of people from this countryto those Commonwealth countries that wish to receive ourmigrants.
Though we have no intention of departing from that policy, the greatly increased expenditure on defence has forcedus to look for all possible economies in other directions.    the expiry of the original term of the Assisted Passage Agreementlast March led us to consider whether it would be possible under present financial circumstances to continue the contribution which we were making to assisted passages to Australia.Discontinuation of this contribution would not, of course, mean that we were against migration to Australia.    On the contrarywe would do everything else to assist and stimulate it.Apart from this consideration, the question arises whether it is any longer appropriate to pay people to emigrate.That policy originated in and belongs to the days of massunemployment.    We wish to encourage and will encouragemigration but we are doubtful whether we should continue to doso in this way.In this connection it must be remembered that there isno other country to which we pay people to emigrate.    Canada,New Zealand and Southern Rhodesia are all anxious to encouragemigration from the United Kingdom and have schemes for assisting it but none of them has asked us to contribute to thecost of those schemes.In these circumstances I would suggest that the trueinterests of the two Governments in this matter might be more effectively furthered if it were decided to discontinue what may beregarded as an out-of-date and anomalous policy, which in anycase is not a very important factor in the total cost of migration,and instead to concentrate on exploring the possibilities of encouraging migration between the United Kingdom and Australiaby co-operation between the two Governments in other ways.6. I take the opportunity to mention that I have recently received fromthe Canadian High Commissioner an aide memoire seeking on behalf of hisGovernment to ascertain the views of the United Kingdom on the questionof encouraging emigration from the United Kingdom to Canada.    I proposeto have a general talk with the Canadian High Commissioner about thismatter at about the same time as I have the discussions with the Australians,-though I have no specific proposals to put to Canada.F.C.G.-W.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1,26TH JUNE, 1951.
