:HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAjESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,S E C R E TCP.(51; 224 COPY NO. 3124TH oULY, 1951CABINETTHE FUTURE OF THE CONDITIONS OF employment and NATIONAL ARBITRATION order memorandum by the Attorney-GeneralPolicy considerations must be the determining factor with regardto the form and content of the new Order and it would be unrealistic toapply the legal criteria, which one might apply in the case of a Statute, toan Order such as this, hammered out by difficult negotiations to reconcileconflicting interests.    At the same time it may be of assistance to mycolleagues to have a short statement of some of its legal implications.2. Basically, as my colleagues will have seen, its effect is that employers, organisations of employers or trade unions may report to theMinister &quot;disputes1 (Article I; or &quot;issues1 (Article 2).    A &quot;dispute&apos; is a&quot;dispute in a trade or industry or section of a trade or industry or in anundertaking, connected with terms of employment or conditions of labour&apos;(it does not include a dispute as to the employment or non-employment ofany person or as to whether any person should or should not be a memberof a trade union).    An &quot;issue1 is an issue as to whether an employer shouldobserve terms and conditions recognised in the district, that is, in effect,established by voluntary negotiation or arbitration.     When there ismachinery for voluntary settlement of the terms and conditions of employ-ment, the employers&apos; organisation or trade union must be one whichhabitually takes part in the settlement of terms and conditions by that machinery.     When there is no such machinery, the organisation or tradeunion must be one which represents e. substantial proportion of the workersor unions.     In effect, therefore, dissident non-affiliated unions would ingeneral be excluded, though there might be breakaway unions which com-plied with the requirement that they should represent substantial numbersof workers.     There is, of course, nothing to prevent any union or employers&apos;organisation or any other body which does not comply with the description inthe Order from reporting disputes to the Minister, but if they did, their so doing would not confer the obligations on the Minister or Tribunal for whichthe Order provides.    Inasmuch as only unions could refer disputes, thedifficulty of single employees referring disputes to the Minister would be avoided.3. When a &quot;dispute&quot; or &quot;issue1 is reported to him, the Minister may take steps to promote a settlement (Article 4) but, in the case of a dispute(as distinct from an issue), he must, when he thinks there is suitablenegotiation or arbitration machinery to which the parties have not had fullresort, refer it to that machinery (Article 5),    Again, in the case of a!dispute&apos; he must, if he has not referred it to this machinery, refer it, ifnot otherwise settled, to the Tribunal within fourteen days after it isreported to him, or such longer period as he thinks desirable, and may, ifit has been referred to the machinery without result, cancel the reference and refer it to the Tribunal (Article 8 \i) and (ii)).    He may also, if he
thinks one of the parties is taking action to compel acceptance of the dis-puted terms or conditions of employment resulting in stoppage of work orsubstantial breach of agreement between the parties, defer referring thedispute to the Tribunal or cause the Tribunal to stay its proceedings solong as the action continues (Article 8 (iii)).    In the case of an &quot;issue1, he must, if not otherwise settled, refer it to the Tribunal, and the Tribunal insuch a case is limited to requiring the employer to conform to the recog-nised terms and conditions or terms and conditions which it thinks not less favourable than the recognised terms and conditions.4. The sanction resulting from the application of this procedure by theMinister is that if the Tribunal makes an award on a dispute or issue referredto it, the terms and conditions specified in the award shall become impliedterms of the contract of employment between the employers and workers to whom the award relates.     The sanction in Order 13 05 that strikes orlockouts which have not been duly reported or which take place within twenty-one days after being reported are illegal is gone and likewise part iii of Order 13 05 which required employers to comply with recognised terms and conditions without any award by the National Arbitration Tribunal.5. In view of the T.U.C. attitude, it would, in any event, be hardlypracticable to reproduce the provisions of Order 1305 making it an offence to declare an illegal strike or lockout.    Even, however, if it had been other-wise possible to retain them, in my opinion the following are strong reasonsagainst retaining them:-(i)     in general it is doubtful whether the criminal law can ever be an effective weapon to restrain strikes;(ii)     it would be impossible to continue any criminal provisions in anOrder - if it were desirable to have them, they should be enacted by Statute;(iii)     if there is any criminal provision whether in an Order or a statute, it is impossible to allow it to be continually disregarded;but prosecutions are difficult to institute and may often involverisk of greatly aggravating the dispute and even possibly pro-voking a wholesale disobedience to the law.    As my colleagues will know, the penal provisions of Order 1305 have been a source of constant difficulty, particularly to the Law Officers.I am in entire agreement with the Minister of Labour that the new order should not retain these provisions.6. If it were desired to retain some criminal sanction, this would have,I think, to be done by Statute after full debate in Parliament, and then I thinkwould be possible only in a very restricted form.     The offence wouldprobably have to consist of deliberately inciting others to disregard avail-able negotiation or arbitration machinery but it would, in general, be diffi-cult to obtain evidence sufficient to establish such an offence, and theprovision would have mainly an &apos;in terrorem&apos; value.     It is, however, forconsideration whether, short of making it a criminal offence, it should bemade civilly actionable to incite others to strike without resorting to negotiation or arbitration, but this, I think, would also have to be by Statuteand not in an Order under Defence Regulations.    A point that may perhaps be made in debate is that the then Attorney-General, when moving theSecond Reading of the Trades Disputes and Trade Unions Act, 1946,advised the House that there would be adequate legal machinery to deal
SCHEDULE1) It is a criminal offence to conspire to do or to incite others to doan unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means.    Therefore tobring about a strike not in connection with a trade dispute is prima faciean indictable offence, but in practice the remedy can only be used in exceptional cases.2) The Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, make sit an offence (in effect) to strike if you know that by so doing you will deprive asubstantial number of people of essential services such as gas and water,or cause damage to life or property.3) If a worker breaks his contract of employment, e. g. , if in the caseof a weekly contract he stops work before the week is out, his employer maysue him for damages for breach of contract.     The damage is generallysmall in money, and may be nominal.    In practice, it has been found that employers, particularly the nationalised undertakings, hesitate to take these proceedings although they have been successfully taken on occasions.The remedy, however, is a remedy open to the individual employers and isnot equivalent to some remedy in the hands of the State as a whole.with &quot;political&quot; strikes and whoever deals with the matter in debate should perhaps be ready to meet this point. The position as to this is as set outin paragraph (1) of the Schedule to this paper.7. In paragraph 6 of his paper (C.P.(51; 221), the Minister of Labourstates that the present Order is experimental and the question of sanctionscan be further considered when it is reviewed.     For the time being, I think the sanction provided, namely, that the terms of the award should be impliedterms of the contract of employment, should be as effective as sanctions inthis field of law can be from the nature of the relationships with which theydeal.I have set out the other sanctions against strikes (such as they are)which remain after the repeal of Order 1305 in a Schedule to this paper, incase my colleagues wish to have them in mind.8. In general, although there are criticisms of form which could bemade, I think that the Order from the legal point should operate satis-factorily;  but in any event its efficacy will no doubt depend far more on theextent to which it is accepted and used by those affected than on its precisewording from the legal point of view.F.S.Royal Courts of Justice, YV.C.2,24TH JULY, 1951.
