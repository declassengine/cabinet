E TCP. v5l) 175 COPY NO. 3l27TH J..NS, 1951CABINETJAPANESE PEACE TREATY-Aemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor -Foreign AffairsCn the 21st June the Cabinet approved the draft Japanese peace treaty agreed in the talks in London with ./Ir. Dulles (CM. (51) 45thConclusions, Minute 4).   I had previously undertaken that I would alsosubmit to the Cabinet the draft covering memorandum to be used incommunicating the draft Treaty to the Governments of the Powersprincipally concerned with the war against Japan (Civl. (51) 43rdConclusions, Minute 3).   After preliminary discussions with the unitedStates Embassy here, agreement has now been reached on the draft memorandum annexed, subject to the approval of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United kingdom and the United States Government.(The dates given in the last two paragraphs of the draft are tentative andsubject to confirmation).2. According to a communication received from the United states embassy, the State Department propose that the draft memorandum and draft Treaty should be handed successively &quot;fco the Ambassadors at&quot;Washington of all the Far Eastern Commission nations, plus indonesia and Ceylon&quot;.   It is assumed that this is not intended to includeNationalist China (which is in fact represented on the Far eastern commission; since there has been no mention of Nationalist China inthis context in the earlier discussions and correspondence with theUnited States Embassy here.   The United States Embassy have been requested to confirm by telegraph from Washington that our inter-pretation on this point is correct.3.- The State Department further propose that the draft should be delivered to the Soviet Embassy in Washington with an appropriatecovering note, also replying to the Soviet note of 10th June.4. The State Department further inform us that they will welcome the attendance of a British official or representative at the presentation of the draft to the Ambassadors concerned in order to emphasise itsjoint sponsorship.   In order to save time, the draft with its covering memorandum would be made available to the several Foreign ministers by the United States or United kingdom Embassies &quot;at the Far eastern commission capitals&quot; (except Moscow/ and at Djakarta and Colombo.Here too the United States Embassy are confirming by telegraph thatthe expression &quot;Far Eastern Commission capitals&quot; is not intended toinclude the capital of the Chinese Nationalist authorities.5. In conclusion the State Department suggest that the July publi-cation date in the last two paragraphs of the draft memorandum should be specified as the fifth day following the scheduled receipt of the draft note
by the last Ambassador of the nations principally concerned.   during that interval of five days, the State Department would circulate thedraft informally to the Embassies at Washington of the other nations at war with Japan, namely, those outside the circle of the Powersprincipally concerned.   This last proposal represents a concession toour own view, which has been that we ought not to risk unnecessarilyoffending the Powers less closely concerned with the war against japan by publishing the draft Treaty before it was communicated totheir Governments in any form.   The shortness of the interval is due tothe risk of leakige through the less responsible states included amongthe principal parties.6. In agreeing to this draft and procedure, the State Department have met all the criticisms advanced by us;  and among other concessionshave agreed to leave out a reference in the memorandum to the factthat the draft Treaty had been discussed with the Japanese Government,which we felt would maie an unfavourable impression on the importantsection of opinion in the United Kingdom,in Australia and othercountries which will anyway be inclined to criticise the proposed peace settlement as too favourable to the Japanese.7. I recommend that my colleagues should:(a) approve the draft covering memorandum;(b) approve the suggested procedure, subject to confirmation by the State Department that the reference to &quot;the far eastern Commission Powers&quot; is not intended to includeNationalist China.H.
