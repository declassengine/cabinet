confidential.P. (51) 20216th July, 1951,-Copy No.31CABINETLIVESTOCK AND MEAT:  SLAUGHTERING policy memorandum by the Minister of Local Government and planning the Committee on Distribution and Marketing are examining what should bethe permanent organisation of meat distribution in this country. The Minister ofFood, the Minister of Agriculture and the Secretary of State for Scotland have con-suited the bodies concerned and a further round of consultations are being arrangedwhich should enable the Committee to formulate proposals for submission to theCabinet. Meantime we must take early decisions on slaughtering policy, becauseexisting slaughterhouses cannot cope with the expanding production of fatstock andnew ones must be planned and built, in conformity with the long-term plans of theGovernment. The Committee are satisfied that the following proposals onslaughtering can be fitted in with any organisation for the marketing and distribu-tion of livestock and meat, which the Committee may subsequently put forward.2. In framing the proposals contained in this memorandum we have had theadvantage of a report from an Interdepartmental Working Party which studied thesubject in considerable detail, and of the report of the Interdepartmental Committeeon Meat Inspection, which the Minister of Food set up in May 1949. Our recom-mendations are unanimous, save in respect of the form which the central controlof slaughtering should take (see paragraph 8 below).3. Before the war there were about 12,000 private slaughterhouses and 120public slaughterhouses in England and Wales, ranging from modern publicslaughterhouses in the larger towns to thousands of small premises at the back ofbutchers&apos; shops. Scotland had fewer and better slaughterhouses, about 590 in private and 146 in public ownership. Throughout the country, more particularlyin England and Wales, there! was much public dissatisfaction on hygienic,humanitarian and economic grounds with the conditions and methods found inmany slaughterhouses. Just before the war the outline of a national policy wasbeginning to emerge, involving a steady reduction in the number of slaughterhousesand an improvement in efficiency and hygiene. But little had been done.4. After the Ministry of Food took over the control of livestock and meatdistribution in 1940, slaughtering had to be concentrated at a manageable numberof points, since this was essential to effective meat rationing. Since 1940 the Ministryof Food has operated under requisition about 600 slaughterhouses, including 103in Scotland. Many are badly sited and of poor construction; About two-thirds ofthe 600 are owned privately or by co-operative societies, and-the remaining one-thirdby local authorities. In Scotland, however, 88 of the 103 slaughterhouses at present being used by the Ministry of Food are owned by local authorities. The remainder of the pre-war 13,000 slaughterhouses in Great Britain were elosed; and many have gone out of existence or have been adapted for other uses,&apos;&apos; . ------5. To-day, the Ministry of Food are still using a hastily-devised scheme of concentrated slaughtering, which was designed to cope with a reduced war-timelivestock population. But since the war the numbers of livestock have increased and slaughtering is more and more concentrated in the autumn months when thegrowth of grass ends. In the autumn of 1950 conditions in many slauglttet^dtises.were very unsatisfactory.   *&quot;     * - &quot;&apos;   .*-&apos;--&apos; -       .       cv--;&apos;--&apos;.&apos;-&apos;40912

D;   &apos; !       -The, fir gt broad.question to be decided is whether (1) there should be a returnto the, pre-war system , pf.. dispersed slaughtering&apos; among severalthousands&apos; ofslaughterhouses, or (2) slaughtering: should/bercohcehtrated in a very few monsterabbatoirs, or (3) there should be moderate concentration with between 250 and 400slaughterhouses. The Committee following the advice they had received prefercourse (3). This will permit the erection of slaughterhouses of such a size and design as,to be hygienic and economical; and will ensure that stock do not have to travel more than ten miles from a local market to the slaughterhouse, except inremote areas, and that butchers can see meat before purchase. It minimises theproblems of labour supply and permits adequate inspection of slaughtering and meat. It can be adapted without difficulty to * public, private or co-operativeownership and control.8. Any policy of concentration involves a limitation on the number ofslaughterhouses and some planning of slaughterhouse siting. A central authority will be required to discharge these functions. There was some disagreement on theCommittee as to this, central authority, and the Cabinet are invited to decide thisquestion in the light of the following summary of die issues involved:  (a) The Minister of Food, supported by some other members of the Committee,considers that his Department must contiue to act as the centralslaughtering authority, at any rate so long as he is responsible for pur-chasing all home-produced livestock and for having it slaughtered anddistributed under the meat rationing scheme. This would represent a continuance Pf the present position, and would avoid the setting up by legislation of any fresh body. Any such legislation would be bound to lead to debates about the speed with which new slaughterhouses wereto be erected, and the nature of the Government^ long-term plans formarketing and distribution of livestock and meat. If the Minister ofFood continued to exercise direct control, the quesjtion whether some: other type of authority should be established could be postponed until apermanent scheme had been worked out for the marketing and distri-&apos;     ? bution of livestock and meat.(b) The Minister of Agriculture favours the establishment of a non-tradingCentral Slaughtering Authority with the duty of planning, in consulta-tion with local authorities and other interests, the siting of slaughter-houses and of securing, through a system of licensing, adherence to,, -      certain standards of hygienic, humanitarian and efficient operation. he considers that the working out of a long-term slaughterhouse policy,;;       will involve a continuing process of detailed consultation and administra-tion, and that it will be more economical and give quicker results if an.. ,    :-. independent authority is appointed at once. He has in mind, that theindependent element in the authority need not consist of more than three part-time members, and that, as the staff would be transferred.   from the Departments concerned, there need be little net increase in;    ,, staff., He feels that the setting up of an independent Central Slaughter-;i     being Authority Jointly responsible to the Minister of Food and the Agri-a: a r hv hi\ culture \Mimsiers,, wpjifd ;se&apos;cure the &apos; confidence: Pf the local - authorities,&apos;-;-\*, o;;!pf rneat, traders,&apos;,an^.7.pf ^ t^he;.&apos;agricultural.&apos;&apos;inte&apos;resrts^ and&apos; Would!greatlyv wj Ii^x^ea^^^^^^^p^s^^^^^ dealing&apos; with dissatisfied interests. --,r/,&apos;Lv;As!it yyilj, Be;iriltially a^i^riiiin^;authority, it need:not   at the outsetprejudice&apos; the pre^nt&apos;&apos; ^x^c^tivfe&apos; ahthbrity&apos; ofj the &apos;Minister of Food.Such a body could also b*&apos;entfasl^i: mtn^fespbhsibili^-fWJthe&apos; ctostely&quot;-j r-jiii  valhed prioblem.of the-siting-pf.livestock markets which.is closely linkedtil] fi)i . )withhthe:siting?^ precedent of theii &apos;tl    ^;;White Fish Author^set up on a provisional basis in advance of legislation&apos;. &apos; .&apos; 1&apos;
9. Under a policy of moderate concentration, it will be necessary to settle the number of slaughterhouses, their location and the area they should serve. Officials have worked out a general siting plan, but many trade and local interests will have to be consulted. The precise location of each slaughterhouse within its town is a matter to be settled under the town and country planning and other regulations. A national siting plan for slaughterhouses should be prepared as soon as possible, in consultation with local interests and with the producer, trade and professional organisations. If a Central Slaughtering Authority is not to be appointed at this stage, the work would be done by the Ministry of Food, the Agriculture Departments, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Local Government and Planning, enlisting the services of independent experts as may be necessary. If a Central Slaughtering Authority is to be set up, the work would be done by that authority.

10. The provision of slaughterhouses should in general remain the function of local authorities, but there may be cases in which a better service could be provided otherwise. We accordingly recommend that, subject to control by a central authority, the ownership and operation of slaughterhouses (both present and to be built) should remain open to local authorities, Co-operative Societies, associations of producers or distributors, and private firms. It is impossible to say to what extent local authorities and the other organisations referred to will be prepared to build slaughterhouses. They would wish to have some information as to the revenue they could earn and the sources from which it would come, the prospects of the eventual nationalisation of slaughterhouses, the form which compensation would take in such an event, and the general conditions under which livestock would be marketed and meat distributed under the permanent scheme. No doubt special assurances would have to be given about compensation in the event of nationalisation, before local authorities and the other organisations mentioned would be prepared to build slaughterhouses, and some assurances that conditions would be created under which they could operate without loss. But, even if these assurances are given, some new building will probably have to be done by the State.

11. There are about 24 places where the construction of a new slaughterhouse is urgently required, of which 7 are needed by September 1952. Construction at these places would fit in with any foreseeable plan of moderate concentration. These new slaughterhouses would be designed for continuous process operation on the production-line principle. This emergency building programme should go forward as quickly as the financial situation and the investment programme will permit. It would be useful if local authorities or other appropriate organisations would provide these new slaughterhouses for operation by the Ministry of Food under the existing arrangements, pending a decision on long-term policy. In so far as local authorities or other organisations will not agree to build, the Ministry of Works should do so in conjunction with the Ministry of Food.

12. There remains the difficult question whether compensation should be paid, in respect of slaughterhouses which will now remain permanently closed. All slaughterhouses, other than those now operated by the Ministry of Food, have been out of business for about eleven years. Many of the buildings have been put to other uses. Butchers who used their own slaughterhouses before the war receive their meat in other ways and have had their profits looked after under the Ministry of Food&apos;s arrangements for settling margins. In future they will presumably continue to obtain meat from centralised slaughterhouses on a basis which will permit them to make a profit. In our view there can be no question of compensation being paid for loss of profits arising either out of the Ministry Of Food&apos;s control of meat supplies or of the decision not to permit slaughterhouses to re-open. There may, however, be exceptional cases where a special building or specially equipped building (perhaps not yet fully paid for) cannot easily be put to other uses and where there has been, or will be, real loss arising out of the deterioration of value of the physical asset. It may be necessary to pay compensation in these exceptional cases, but any assurances given at the present time should be in the most guarded terms, pending further examination of the extent of the problem.

13. If the Ministry of Food exercise central control over slaugterhouses, there will be no need for legislation to enable that Department, in conjunction with the Ministry of Works, to proceed with the emergency building programme. If a 
Central Slaughtering Authority were set up, legislation would be required. Perma-nent legislation will eventually be required to define the powers of any permanentauthority, whether it be a Department or a Corporation, and also to coyer any payments by way of compensation for closed slaughterhouses. Any legislation would have to take into account the special position of Scotland, where, as pdintedout? above, there has long been a greater degree of public control and better con-ditions of slaughtering than in England. Northern Ireland would wish to make its own arrangements in adapting any United Kingdom policy to itsiowhicqnditions.14. The recommendations which the Committee on Distribution; and Marketingwish to make in regard to slaughtering policy may be summarised as follows:-(i) The future development , of slaughterhouses should be based, as apermanent policy, on a moderate concentration of slaughtering. Thisnecessarily involves some central control of the number and siting ofslaughterhouses.(ii) Early, steps should be taken to prepare a national siting plan for slaughter-V:     houses, in conjunction with local interests and with the producer, tradeand professional organisations,, (iii) A decision is required whether, as proposed by the Minister of Food, thepreparation of a national siting plan should be undertaken by thetU  ,. ;, Departments concerned with the help of one or two independent experts,or whether, as proposed by the Minister of Agriculture, it should be, ; carried put by an ad hoc central slaughtering authority consisting ofpart-time independent members which would be responsible jointly tothe Minister of Food and the Agricultural Ministers.(iv) The ownership and occupation of slaughterhouses should remain open tolocal&apos;authorities, co-operative societies, associations of producers anddistributors and private firms, subject to the central control of slaughter-houses referred to in (i) above.(v) An emergency building programme for the construction of 24 slaughter-houses in areas where they are urgently required should go forward as speedily as the financial situation and the investment programmepermits, with provision for at least 7 in 1952. Local authorities, orother appropriate bodies, should be pressed to undertake this new construction, but where they are unwilling this should be done by theMinistry of Works, in conjunction with the Ministry of Food.(vi) In exceptional cases, compensation should be paid to the owners of closedslaughterhouses, but not for any loss of profits.(vii) An early announcement should be made of Government policy on the issues summarised above: and any necessary legislation should be laidbefore Parliament in due course.;.)-, &quot;       H.
