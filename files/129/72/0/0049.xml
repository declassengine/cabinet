CONFIDE confidential ,C.(54) 39920th December, 1954REDISTRIBUTION OF seats memorandum by the Lord Privy SealMr. Justice Roxburgh on Friday, 17th December granted an interim injunction preventing the Home Secretary from submitting toHer Majesty the Draft Orders in Council dealing with ParliamentaryBoundaries.    The appeal against this is being taken to-day by the attorney-General, but it is unlikely that this will be decided by 3.30 p. m. ,quite apart from the possibility of a further appeal by either party tothe House of Lords.2.      The question is whether to go on with the debate on the remainingDraft Orders to-day or to accept the situation - while reserving for a future occasion the question of the Judge&apos;s competence to deal with sucha matter - and proceed to other business, leaving to the future discussion on the respective rights of Parliament and of the Judiciary in cases suchas this.    I append the draft of a Statement to be made to-day in theHouse of Commons.H.C.Gwydyr House, S.W.I.18th December, 1954.COPY NO.6^X-CABINETDRAFT statement the grant of an interim injunction by a Judge of the High Courtregarding a matter now before Parliament, raises questions of constitutional importance on which this House may desire in due course to be advised by the Law Officers of the Crown in the discharge of their special responsibilities to this House.I am sure that the House will agree that, while neither theGovernment nor indeed the House must do anything to abrogateParliamentary rights, it would be untimely and perhaps out of keeping withthe dignity of the House to debate these  matters at the moment whenissues arising out of them are actually beitig discussed in the Courts.This must not, however, be taken to mean an acceptance of theview that this is a justiciable matter and not a matter for Parliament it-self.    It is therefore proposed to-day to begin the debate on the national assistance Board Draft Regulations which will be concluded to-morrow.
