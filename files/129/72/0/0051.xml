(TH^DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret. (54) 401 COPY NO._   .20th December, 1954CABINETPARKING METERSNote by the Secretary of the CabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister I circulate the draft of astatement to be made in the House of Lords on parking meters.(Signed)  NORMAN brook cabinet Office, S.W.I.20th December, 1954DRAFT STATEMENT......  I now come to certain proposals which have aroused considerable interest.    Clauses 10 - 14 and the First Schedule of the Bill are designedto give the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation power, on the appli-cation of a local authority, to designate by order parking places on high-ways in the Metropolitan Police District where charges for parking maybe levied;  payment may be made either to authorised attendants or bydropping a coin into a parking meter.In recent years, particularly in London and in other big cities,the practice has grown up of using the public streets as a free long-termparking place.    In this v/ay valuable space, urgently required for the useof moving vehicles, has been used for long periods by stationary vehicles.This is not the first time that suggestions for charging for parkingon the public highway have been put forward.    Your Lordships may recall that during the passage of the Public Health Bill of 1925 through parliament it was proposed in your Lordships&apos; house that charges might be authorised for such services as those provided by an attendant;  the proposal was,however, rejected in another place.    In the ensuing 30 years the numberof vehicles has increased to such an extent, and traffic congestion hasbecome so alarming, that more and more restrictions have had to be imposed merely to keep traffic on the move.    In London (and the same is substantially true of all our large cities) much of the available kerb spaceis occupied from early in the day by cars which are left for long periods;in consequence a motorist, a vanman or a lorry-driver who has good andlegitimate reason, for wishing to have his vehicle   in a certain place fora short time finds it impossible to do so.    This cannot be in the best interests of the community, and certainly adds appreciably to the cost ofindustry.    The British Transport Commission estimate that the use of
streetsas free car parks increases their operating costs in the london transport area by not less than  500,000 a year, and the total cost to thecommunity as a whole must be enormous.Your Lordships will, however, ask &quot;Granting all this to be true,how will charging for the use of the highway help?&quot;.      Before I answer that question I must make one very important point;  it must not besupposed that the installation of parking meters, which is a convenientand simple method of charging for parking, will by itself provide thesolution to the problem of traffic congestion.    This calls for comprehensive,drastic and probably unpopular measures;  the twin objectives must beto ensure that the motirist who wants to leave his car for long periodsremoves it from the highway, and to regulate short term parking bydefining, and charging for, the periods for which the motorist may leavehis car on the public roads.    With this must go strict enforcement.I shall seek to show that while parking meters play an important part,it is only a part of our wide and general   plan.Seen therefore not as an end in themselves, but as part of a comprehensive plan for relieving traffic congestion, parking meters can help in two ways.    First, they will provide motorists whose requirements for parking are short&quot;term with the requisite facilities at a small cost.A motorist who parks by a parking meter and pays his fee will not haveto worry about the possibility of finding a policeman waiting for him onhis return - assuming, of course, that he has not overstayed his time ISecondly, the revenue derived from parking meters, after initial costshave been met, will provide a fund which can be used to facilitate theprovision of parking places off the highway and can only be used for thispurpose.    This is specially provided for in clause 14(3) of the Bill.Parking meters are now in use in many of the large cities of theUnited States of America.    From small and modest beginnings they have come to be widely adopted in a very few years.     Their use in this country on authorised parking places was recommended by a Working Party,presided over by the Chairman of the London and Home Counties TrafficAdvisory Committee, which was set up to consider the problems of carparking in the inner asea of London, and produced a most stimulating and valuable report in 1953.    I must tell your Lordships that Her Majesty^Government are not in entire agreement with the detailed recommendations which the Working Party made on the use of parking meters, but with theprinciple of their experimental use they are in full agreement.I think your Lordships will wish to have a general outline of how theproposals set out in the Bill will work in practice if they receive the blessingof Parliament.    In the first place, the powers proposed to be conferred onthe Minister are limited to the Metropolitan Police District;  they can beextended to other areas of the country by means of Orders, which will besubject to negative resolution procedure.     Under these provisions theinitiative rests with a local authority to apply to my right hoxi. Friendfor an Order designating a parking place where charges can be made; beforeapplying for such an Order a local authority must consult with the chief officer of police.    The detailed procedure to be followed thereafter is setout in the First Schedule;  briefly, there must be advertisement of theapplication, full consideration of any London scheme by the London TrafficAdvisory Committee, and an inquiry if the Minister thinks it necessary;for initial schemes I find it hard to believe that an inquiry will not benecessary.    The first proposals for the designation of these special parking
places will normally, therefore, go through at least three distinct stages of examination;  the first, that by the local authority who are thinking of puttingproposals to the Minister, the second by the ordinary machinery of public inquiry, and the third by the Minister himself before he decides, in the lightof all the evidence, whether or not to confirm the Order submitted to him.My right hon. Friend envisages a modest start in the shape of one full-scaleexperiment with parking meters in London, and possibly in one or two of ourlarger cities, before any question can arise of their adoption as a generalpart of our traffic control apparatus.    I used the word &quot;full-scale&quot;advisedly;  if these experiments are to be of real value - if we are to be ableto draw useful conclusions from them - the area to be covered by a scheme must be substantial.    It is here that we differ from the conclusions of theWorking Party to which I referred earlier;  they felt that parking metersshould only be introduced on a very limited scale in the immediate neighbour-hood of underground garages.One of the matters about which my right hon. Friend will have to besatisfied before agreeing to the introduction of a parking meter scheme willbe that it must form part of a well thought out and comprehensive plan for meeting the traffic requirements of a substantial area.    Little or nothing would be gained if the introduction of parking meters merely forced a largenumber of private cars from one area of London into another.    The questionof enforcement is therefore of primary importance.    In America and else -where meters have worked well.    In this country we have to be careful toavoid adding undue extra burdens on our over-worked and under-strengthpolice.    One of the attractions of a parking meter system is the way inwhich it does give relief to the police as compared with a system of parkingprohibitions.     The local authority will provide for the enforcement of theparking meter system.    In the first place the charge will be made for the permitted period by the machine itself, which will be in the care of thelocal authority.    If the permitted time is overstayed, no offence will be committed in the first place, but a much higher charge will be incurred.    this it will be the responsibility of the local authority to collect.    It is only inthe event of this further period being overstayed, that any question of thecommission of an offence will arise.    And in respect of this it will be, ingeneral, the local authority which institutes the prosecution.    The general supervision of these parking places, and the enforcement of the regulations governing their use, will be the responsibility of the local authority whosescheme it is.I trust that this necessarily brief account will give your Lordshipsa clear idea of what Her Majesty&apos;s Government are proposing in this partof the Bill.    My last word on the question of charging for the use of the highway, by parking meters or otherwise, must be to emphasise the experimental character of what is put before your Lordships in this Bill.There is no question of immediate or widespread installation of parkingmeters;  Her Majesty&apos;s Government are in no sense whatever committed to the permanent adoption of this device.    What we seek is the power toexperiment with something which has been widely adopted elsewhere, andnot unless it proves to be capable of making a real and substantial contribution to our traffic problems will the parking meter become acommon feature of our landscape.
