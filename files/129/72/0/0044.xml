JOINT COMMUNIQUE ANNOUNCING THE agreement. From the outset the United Kingdom Government has welcomed the conception of the Schuman Plan, both on account of its contribution to theefficiency and the stability of the basic industries of the countries concerned andon account of its contribution to the wider cause of European unity.2. When the European Coal and Steel Community was formed, the UnitedKingdom Government declared its desire to establish an intimate and enduringassociation with the Community, and this declaration was warmly welcomed bythe High Authority.3. As a first step towards this objective the United Kingdom government established relations with the High Authority and on 1st September, 1952 a delegation, headed by Sir Cecil Weir, took up its duties at Luxembourg.4. In view of the substantial progress which has since then been made bythe High Authority in its task of creating a common market in coal and steel withinthe area of the Community, the United Kingdom Government and the high authority and the Governments of the States members of the Community considerthat the time has now come to take a further step in the development of therelations between the United Kingdom and the Community.5. With this object the United Kingdom Government of the one part andthe Governments of the States members of the Community and the High Authorityof the other part have concluded an Agreement concerning the relations betweenthe United Kingdom and the Community.6. This Agreement establishes a Standing Council of Association composedof four representatives of the United Kingdom Government and fourrepresentatives of the High Authority. In view of the powers and responsibilities in regard to the coal and steel industries of the United Kingdom which have beenconferred by law upon the National Coal Board and the Iron and Steel Board,the representatives of the United Kingdom Government on the Council of association will include one member of the National Coal Board and one memberof the Iron and Steel Board.7. The function of the Council of Association will be to provide means forcontinuous consultation in regard to matters of mutual interest relating to coal and steel and, where appropriate, in regard to the co-ordination of action, consistent with the international obligations of the parties concerned, to deal with thesematters.8. It is recognised that the extent of the benefits to be obtained will inevitablydepend upon the extent to which normal trade can flow between the UnitedKingdom and the Community. The Council of Association has therefore beengiven the duty to examine restrictions and other factors affecting mutual tradein coal and steel between the two areas, with a view to making such proposalsfor their reduction or elimination as may be agreed for the mutual benefit of theUnited Kingdom and the Community.9. The Agreement also provides that matters which, under the terms of theTreaty constituting the Community, fall to be considered by the Council ofMinisters or the Governments of the States members of the Community and whichare also of common interest to the Community and the United Kingdom shall bethe subject of special meetings in which the United Kingdom Government,represented by one of its members together with persons discharging publicresponsibilities in regard to coal and steel in the United Kingdom, will meet withthe Council of Ministers. The High Authority will participate fully in these meetings.10. The Council of Association will pay due regard to the interests of consumers of coal and steel, to the interest of third countries and to the special relationship between the United Kingdom and the other members of theCommonwealth.11. Both parties trust that these new arrangements will help to promote a growing association between the United Kingdom and the Community whichwill, they believe, contribute to their common prosperity and assist in the advancement of  European unity.
