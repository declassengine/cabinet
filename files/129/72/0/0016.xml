J$. ****fX!*^p&quot;~&amp;I TOP SECRET Copy No.?^f...| C.(54) 36629th November, 1954 B&amp;VCABINETNORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANISATION-; AUTHORITY??I OF THE SUPREME ALLIED COlvMiNDSR, EUROPEBBb JVlemorandum by the Minister of Defence BBlB I have considered the Foreign Secretary&apos;s paper on authority ^^Bfor the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe (SACEUR) to use nuclear BUBBV weapons (C. (54) 365).    This is an issue of major importance. BBb2.        Of course we must make it clear beyond doubt that responsibilityfor the actual decision must rest with Governments. ^^BBBV 3.        But, whilst we must maintain this fundamental principle, we BBgmust not put our military commanders in an impossible position. BVJ4. In view of the great disparity in conventional forces, SACEUR ^^Bcannot produce a worthwhile alternative plan for the defence of Western ^^BBBb Europe on the basis of a non-nuclear war.    Even if such a plan were BBhpossible, it would revive the old enormous &quot;Force Goals&quot; which we have BBhall agreed economically were incapable of achievement.5. I would suggest therefore that the resolution should be amendedBBV BBB&quot;The North Atlantic Council.....accept as a basis formilitary planning that the measures in the enclosure to therepoi*t are necessary to adapt our military forces for a BBBfuture major war, but emphasise that it must remain the BBBultimate responsibility of member Governments to take BBBat the material time final decisions particularly in regardto the use of nuclear weapons. &quot;6. I am also unhappy about the wording of paragraph 8(b).    I have BBBalways understood that, whilst we could welcome an overall disarmamentplan, we have in all our discussions at the United Nations OrganisationBBb refused for obvious reasons to consider limitations in the use of nuclear . BBBBBfl weapons, except as part of an overall disarmament convention coveringboth conventional and non-conventional forces and weapons. BBB7. The &quot;example&quot; in paragraph 8(b) might perhaps be better BVBexpressed as &quot;a universal disarmament convention covering not only HHHBBb nuclear weapons but conventional forces also&quot;.Ministry of Defence, S.
