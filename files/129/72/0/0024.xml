(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret. (54) 3743rd December, 1954CABINETBRITISH EUROPEAN AIRWAYS;MAINTENANCE BASE AT RENFREWMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation on 24th November the Cabinet invited me to make a further reporton the maintenance base at Renfrew after my discussions with theScottish Trade Union Council and the Scottish Council (Development ofIndustry) (C. C. (54) 78th Conclusions, Minute 2).2. I saw them at Renfrew on 26th November.    The Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Henderson Stewart) was good enoughto be present.3. No new point was raised.4. I therefore see no reason to modify the recommendation made inparagraph 14 of C. (54) 345.5. In the course of discussion at Cabinet the defence aspect of this problem was raised.    I am not, of course, competent to express a view on this.     I would, however, submit that if British European Airways are on defence grounds to be induced to remain at Renfrew, their case forreimbursement of the loss so caused is very strong.    Such reimbursementwould presumably come from Defence Votes.6. I took advantage of my visit to Renfrew to inspect the maintenancebase.    It is well built, designed and laid out, though not, of course, atpresent fully used.    It should certainly appear attractive to firms engaged in aircraft work.    The Cabinet invited the President of the Boardof Trade and the Minister of Supply to report on the prospects of finding a suitable alternative tenant and I will not, therefore, comment on this aspect of the matter.J.A.B-C.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W. 1.2nd December, 1954.
