(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA.JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETC0(54) 33713th Deeember, 1954CABINETCOPY NO.   pg&quot;EAST/WEST TRADE: STRATEGIC controls memorandum by the Minister of Transport and civil aviation in Co (54) 385 the President of the Board of Trade proposes thatin his next communication with Mr. Stassen about control of shipping sales to Iron Curtain countries he should suggest that ships between 10 and 20years1 old should count for only half their tonnage against the proposedquota, and that ships over 20 years&apos;old should be entirely free,2.        I do not think that this, based as it is on equal quotas for thiscountry and such, from a maritime point of view, insignificant countries as Belgium and Italy, is either right or defensible,,3. I should much prefer shipping to be exempted altogether from the suggested package deal or, if this is impossible, at least that second-handshipping should be excluded from the quota.4.        But, if a compromise is essentials our shixoping industry should at least be free to sell ships built during the war.    These are what theymost wish to replace.    War-built ships comprise over a third of our dry-cargo tonnage and are becoming uncompetitive and costly to maintain,5.        As I have already suggested to the President of the Board of Trade,a compromise might be just defensible to the industry and public opinionif it took the following form;-(a) second-hand ships under two years&apos; old should countas full rate against the quota;(b) second-hand ships over two and under ten years1 oldshould count as half rate;  and(c) second-hand ships over ten years- old should not count at all.Ministry of Transport and CivilAviation, W.1.11th December, 1954.
