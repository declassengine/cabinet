It was necessary, as a preliminary step, to decide how best to deal with the heavy stocks of Government sugar in order to prepare theway for the re-opening of a free market.     I am glad to say that I have now reached agreement with the Chancellor on this.     Taking these arrangementsinto account the latest estimates indicate that there will be a deficit on sugar trading at 31st March, 1955 and again in the financial year 1955/56.This is due to the cost of carrying excess stocks and the losses which willprobably be incurred in disposing of some part of them over the eighteen months in the open market overseas.3. An immediate price increase equivalent to jd. per lb. retailfor refined sugar v/ould yield some  3 millions in the foui- remaining monthsof the financial year and to that extent reduce the deficit to 31st March, 1955but would not eliminate it completely.    So far as can be foreseen a continuation of the increased price throughout the financial year 1955/56would yield some  7 millions and should more or less cover the estimateddeficit in that year.    So long as my Ministry is the sole importer of sugarfor the home trade any increase decided upon would be made by raising theMinistry&apos;s price of raw sugar to refiners, who would pass it on to theconsumer.4. I am very conscious of the needs of the Budget and am readyto fall in with the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s strong desire to increasethe price of sugar by the equivalent of Id. per lb. retail straight away.    Atthe same time I think it necessary to set out some of the broaderconsiderations involveds-(a)      The loss is due in part to the special Cuban sugarpurchase last year combined with a record home beet crop,unexpectedly high, production in countries within theCommonwealth Sugar Agreement and low consumption inthe months immediately following derationing as a resultof the using up of hidden stocks accumulated by privateconsumers and traders during control.     The Cuban purchase in the circumstances of the time was an essentialprerequisite to the ending of rationing.     It can be contended,COPY NO,   /O
V. therefore, that since the consumer has benefitedfrom the policy made possible by the purchases heshould bear the cost of it through the retail price.(b) The consumer has not been made to bear thecost of derationing other kinds of food and losses indisposing of Government stocks have been borne by the taxpayer.    I should jioint out, however, that with otherkinds of food,rationing and control ended simultaneouslyand we were never in a position to make the consumerpay.    Making the taxpayer meet trading losses was not,therefore, a matter of deliberate policy;  we could do nothing else.(c) Just before sugar was decontrolled we raised theprice and stated that we were bringing the subsidy on sugar to an end.    Not to increase the xDrice of sugar wouldmean, therefore, that by a deliberate act of policy we should now be subsidising it in the sense that we should be incurringa trading loss in the holding and clearing of terminal stocks.(d) The trend of world prices is downwards (theCommonwealth price has just been reduced by 5/&quot; a ton)and traders are probably expecting a reduction in price.In these circumstances an increase in the Ministry&apos;sselling price of raw sugar would be critically received bythe sugar trade, by the large sugar-using industries andby those who claim to speak for the consumer.(e) This would be the first occasion for a considerable period on which the Government would be raising the priceof a basic food by a deliberate act of policy and it would attract wide publicity accordingly.5. We should be able to deal with trad.e criticism without greatdifficulty.     But an increase in the price of sugar to the public is another matter.     It would have little real effect upon the cost of living (+0. OS in the retail price index) but we must expect the Opposition and some of our own supporters to make a good deal of it.    Sugar is a political subject and anincrease of over 6 per cent in price would probably make headlines at thepresent time.6. I invite my colleagues to decide whether the Ministry&apos;sselling price for raw sugar should be increased immediately by the equivalent of Id. per lb. retail for refined sugar.D.K.A.Ministry of Food, S.W.1.26th November, 1954.
