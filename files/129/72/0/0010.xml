(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret (54) 360 COPY NO,   &amp; W-29th November, 1954CABINETTHE SPANISH CAMPAIGN AGAINST GIBRALTARMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonie;I am much concerned at the attitude which the Spanish Govern-ment have adopted to Gibraltar ever since the Queen&apos;s visit in May.Restrictions on travel and trade .        They have been imposing a series of restrictions on travel andtrade between Spain and Gibraltar with the object of harassing the peopleof Gibraltar, impairing their economy and showing how much better offthey would be if Gibraltar were not a British possession.3.        These restrictions have varied between calculated insult (forexample the issue of Spanish passports &quot;valid for travel to all countriesexcept the U0SoS0Ra and Gibraltar&quot;), refusal of export permits for Spanishgoods ordered by Gibraltar firms and insistence that Spaniards working in Gibraltar must convert all their earnings (about  1 million a year)into pesetas instead of bringing a third of them into Spain in the form ofgoods bought in Gibraltar, which has always been the practice in the pastoThis will cost Gibraltar about  350,000 worth of trade a year.    A fulleraccount of the principal restrictions is at Appendix A.4.        In none of these measures have the Spanish Government gonebeyond what it is in their legal powers to doD    It has therefore been difficult to take them up individually.    But there can be no doubt at allthat they are unfriendly in intention, coupled as they have been with aseries of unfriendly references in the Spanish Press.Effect of restrictions5.        Cumulatively their effect has been considerable.    The Colony!revenue, about  1 million a year, is expected to be cut next year by about25 per cento    The general level of trade is likely to be down about30 per cent, while of course whose whose trade depended chiefly onSpain will suffer much more than that.    The Colony can and willrestore its revenue to some extent by increasing taxation.    But theextent to which it can do this is limited, and will become more limitedas the general level of trade falls.Encroachments on &quot;neutral ground116.        There have also been a series of encroachments on the area,some 800 yards wide, north of the present British frontier.    This isgenerally called &quot;the neutral ground&quot;, though the precise legal positionis rather obscure.    While the Spanish Government have exercised
or some rights of sovereignty, e.g4 they have policed the area and maintained the road, it has been the practice that there should be nochange in the position (for instance, that no buildings should be erected)without consultation between the two sides.    The Spaniards are nowerecting a police post close to the British frontier and a gate acrossthe road within one foot of the British gate.    The Governor has made alocal protest and the Foreign Office are considering whether this can.if need be, be followed up by a formal protest to Madrid.    Unlesschecked, encroachments on this neutral area might seriously affect thesecurity of the Rock.Reactions in Gibraltar7.        I have just received a Delegation from the Gibraltar legislative and City Councils who have represented to me, to other Ministers andto various Members of Parliament, on the one hand the completeloyalty of the population and on the other that Her Majesty&apos;s government cannot continue to take no public notice of the campaign.    I must agreewith themcAction already taken8.        The Foreign Secretary, in a Parliamentary answer on24th November, said:   &quot;I  must make it plain that it is the intentionof Her Majesty&apos;s Government to take care of Gibraltar and theGibraltarians whatever anybody else may try to do about it&quot; and that&quot;the imposition of the restrictions raises doubts as to whether theSpanish Government seriously wish for those correct and friendly relations that we ourselves consider desirable&quot;.9.        I myself, with the concurrence of the Chancellor of theExchequer, have stated publicly that we will stand behind Gibraltarfinancially,     I attach a copy of the Question and Answer in the House,also on 24th November (Appendix B).Forthcoming trade talks100       Can we leave it at this?    A delegation leaves for Madrid on29th November to discuss arrangements for trade and payments betweenthe two countries for 1955.    Should we warn the Spania.rds at the outset of the talks that our attitude in them must be influenced by their willingness or otherwise to let up on the unfriendly policy towardsGibraltar and should we in the talks try to secure a return to a freeflow of trade and persons between Spain and Gibraltar?11.        The Economic Policy Committee discussed the matter on25th November (E,A.(54) 20th Meeting, Item 3).    Our bargaining position is not very strong.    Taking visible and invisible earningstogether, Spain earns from us about  50 millions sterling a year,while we earn from her only about  45 millions.    But we need badlysome of the things which she sells us, e.g. pyrites and high grade iron ore and it is difficult to see what we can do in relation to her visibletrade with us which might not hurt  us as much as it hurt her.    Thereare also considerable payments due from Spain in respect of pastdebts, the expropriation of the Rio Tinto Mine, insurance, etc
15.       I now ask the Cabinet to consider whether any further measures should be taken against Spain, either simply by diplomatic protests tothe effect that friendly relations between the two countries cannot beexpected so long as the campaign continues, or by reduction of the travel allowance or by any other means.A. L. B,Colonial Office, S.W.1.27th November, 1954.12,       The most vulnerable part of Spain&apos;s dealings with us is the tourist trade,,    The Spaniards estimate that 200,000 British touristsvisited Spain this year and that there may be 250,000 next year.     Theymay well spend  10 millions of sterling.    Is it right that this flowshould remain unchecked in the face of the campaign?    The Gibraltariansthemselves have imposed a voluntary embargo on visits to Spain.I realise that there would be serious objections to reducing the travel allowance for Spain.    Nevertheless I suggest that this should be seriously considered.Economic Policy Committee &apos;s decisions13.       The Economic Policy Committee decided that the wholequestion of what could or could not be done was largely a politicalone which must be considered by the Cabinet.    On economic grounds itwas in our interests for the talks to go on as planned.     They should therefore begin on a purely economic basis.    If the Cabinet decided on measures to counter the campaign against Gibraltar, the fact that the talks had begun would not stand in the way.    In any publicity given tothe talks care should be taken to avoid giving the impression that theywere being conducted in an atmosphere of goodwill.The &quot;differential&quot;14.       I should mention one possible bargaining counter which might prove a useful face-saver to the Spaniards if they showed any disposition to meet us.    This is the question of the differential in the cost-of-livingallowance paid to Spaniards and Gibraltarians working in the GibraltarDockyards.    I attach a separate note about this at Appendix C,
43SUMMARY OF RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED(1)    March. - April, 1954:   Spanish daily workers employed on thebasis of a 5&quot;day 44-hour week v/ere denied entry to the Colony onSaturdays, Sundays and feast days, and thus were unable to increase their earnings by overtime rates.    The situation remains unchanged.(2)   May:    Travellers of all nationalities denied passage from Spainto Gibraltar, either through Algeciras by sea, or through La Linea byland.    The normal position was restored after a week or so followingprotests by travel agencies and, it is understood, by the American Consulin Seville,(3)   May:    Closing of Spanish Consulate in Gibraltar, thus making itnecessary for any Gibraltarian wishing for a visa for Spain to send hispassport to London for a visa.    The Consulate has not been re-opened,(4)   May?   Regular Spanish visitors (shoppers) denied passage to gibraltar, either through Algeciras or La Linea.    New passports issuedare not valid for Gibraltar.    The position is still unchanged.(5)   June:   Local firms supplying building materials from Spain had their export licences stopped.     They were granted later when the gibraltar Government explained that it would make it necessary to standoff Spanish building workers.(6)    August:  Spanish daily workers denied facilities hitherto enjoyedfor carrying into Spain small quantities of consumer goods (principallyfoodstuffs and medical supplies) purchased out of that part of their sterling earnings (i. e. one-third of wages) which they were not requiredto exchange into pesetas.    As a concession they are permitted to enterSpain with one leaf of bread and a quarter-pound of tobacco daily;  twotins of milk weekly;  and one kilo of coffee monthly.     The positionremains unchanged.(7)    Restrictions imposed on British subjects resident in the Campoarea to prevent them visiting Gibraltar except for work.    A number ofGibraltarians normally take houses in the Campo area for the summer months.    While the men were allowed to go into Gibraltar daily to work,their families were only able to do so twice a month.(3)    The Spanish authorities have refused export permits for fruitfor Gibraltar canneries.    In May the canneries agreed with theCompanea Levantina of Valencia to take 2,000 tons of fresh apricots,payment to be made in sterling.    Despite representations by the british consul at Valencia and the Embassy in Madrid, no export permit was granted.    It is known that fresh apricots were exported to France.There are very strong reasons for believing that a permit was refusedsolely on political grounds.    In late July, and in consequence of the intervention of the Embassy in IvJadrid, an export licence for 750 tonsof peaches was granted,(9)    November:  Closing of the Spanish Government Travel Bureau in gibraltar.    The Spaniards are now building a frontier post on &quot;neutral&quot;ground, only one foot away from a British frontier post.    The &quot;neutral&quot;ground is an area 800 yards wide joining the Gibraltar peninsula to theSpanish mainland.    Its precise status has never been determined, but thepresent move is a marked departure from the status quo which each sidehas been content to maintain for many years.    A strong loc &quot;-l protest isbeing made, as a preliminary perhaps to a formal diplomatic protest.

In recent months certain restrictions have been imposed by the Spanish Government on the normal flow of trade and persons out of and in to Gibraltar.    The objects of the delegation incoming to London were, first, to assure Her Majesty&apos;s Government ofthe complete loyalty of the people of Gibraltar to the British Crown and,secondly, to discuss the situation created by these restrictions.I was, of course, able to tell the delegation that no one in thiscountry has ever had any doubts as to the complete and absolute loyaltyof the population of Gibraltar and to repeat to them the assurance whichI gave a couple of months ago that Gibraltar&apos;s integrity as a Britishpossession is beyond dispute.I have also given the delegation an assurance that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment have no intention of allowing future essential development in Gibraltar to suffer through no fault of the Colony.    On the under-standing that the Gibraltar Government will make the maximum possible use of their own resources Her Majesty&apos;s Government will, subjectto Parliamentary approval, be prepared to give such assistance asmay prove to be needed for carrying out this development.
At present, Gibraltarian workers employed by the Servicesand the Government get a cost-of-living allowance of 48/- a week overand above their basic wage.    The allowance to Spanish workers so employed, however, is only 24/- a week.The question arose some months ago whether this discriminationshould not be brought to an end.     There was considerable discussion ofthis between Departments in London and eventually the Cabinet askedmy predecessor to seek the views of the Governor on the questionwhether the position could be held by an increase of the Spaniards1allowance from 24-/- to 34/- a week (C. C. (54) 56th Conclusions, Minute 5).The Governor advised that he could not agree to any improve -ment in the allowance paid to the Spanish workers while the presentcampaign continued.     He remains of the view that, when the time comesfor any change to be made, it must be to give the Spaniards completeequality.If it were desired to offer the Spaniards some face-saver asthe price of calling off their campaign, complete equality of the cost-of-living allowance (total cost to the Exchequer about  150,000  a year) mightbe one means of securing that.    It is questionable, however, whether ,until there is some evidence of a desire on the part of the Spaniards tocall off the campaign, it would be wise to dangle this carrot beforethem.THE DIFFERENTIAL IN COST-OF-LIVING ALLOWANCESPAID TO SPANIARDS AND GIBRALTARIANSWORKERS IN THE GIBRALTAR  DOCKYARDS
