\U3(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)SECRETCc(54) 3851 Ith December, 1954COPY NO.CABINETEAST/vYEST TRADE: STRATEGIC controls memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of trade the Cabinet invited me to submit for their approval thedraft of a communication to the United States Government^ revised in thelight of the Cabinefs discussion on 8th December (C0C,(54) 84th Conclusions,Minute 6):  the draft is annexed.2. As the Cabinet desired, I have modified the draft to give greater scope for exports of second-hand ships, though I have not beenable to go as far as the Minister of Transport would wish.    The proposal in the draft telegram that ships between 10 and 20 years old should countfor only half their tonnage against the quota, and that ships over 20 years old should be entirely free seems to me the maximum we can ask of the americans if we are to have any chance of getting thern to accept a comprehensive settlement of the outstanding issues.    I therefore recommend that the message be now sent as drafted.oT rBoard of Trade, S.W.1.10th December, 1954.
annex draft TELEGRAM TO WASHINGTONYour telegram No. 2544.East/West trade controls.Please pass immediately following message from President,Board of Trade to Mr. Stassen.    Begins?    Last summer between us wemanaged to reach agreement over a large area of East/West tradecontrols.    I have been concerned by our failure to achieve a final settle&quot;ment of the questions which were then left outstanding.     The mostimportant of these have been transit controls, shippings and rolling mills,and to these should now be added the problem of copper wire.     Mycolleagues and I feel that we should make an effort to reach Anglo-american agreement on these at one stroke.    Despite our difficulties we areprepared to go a long way to meet you and I feel confident that you willreciprocate.    The main thing is to achieve a comprehensive settlementof all these outstanding difficulties.2, First as to transit controls,    I told you that we would introducetransaction controls.    I have now signed the Order introducing these controls as from 7th January, 1955.    Any delay here has, as you know,been due simply to the desire, which you share, to bring the rest ofEurope with us.    I claim no credit for carrying out what I consider to be part of my side of the bargain but the Transit Authorisation Certificatescieme is integral to any attempt to stop the flow of goods already on the embargo list and, in our view, strategically far more important thanmarginal adjustments to that list.3, As regards shipping, you are well aware of the great difficulties we foresee in defending to public opinion here a settlement which contains the special exception in favour of Denmark and confinesthe United Kingdom industries to what will be represented here to be anunreasonably small share of the trade.    They had accepted controlsimposed for strategic reasons but they will not be able to understand whyDenmark should be allowed to send strategically dangerous ships or whatstrategic significance there is in equal quotas between countries with vastly-different ship-building capacities.    I am sure you will agree that harm willbe caused to Anglo-American relations by any suggestion that such a situation had been forced upon us.    Nevertheless, my colleagues and I havegivenTong and anxious consideration to ways of eliminating this source of disagreement;  we would be prepared, as part of a settlement which included the other two outstanding questions of copper wire and rollingmills referred to below, to accept for the present the proposal put forward in the Paris Group in the summer, subject to the following modifications(i)  There should be prior consultation in the case of danish ships over 15^ knots,(ii) We are not committed in principle to a system of equal national quotas for the export of ships.Our participation in the scheme would, in thefirst instance, continue only until the end of1955.    We shall have to decide, in the light ofpublic opinion and the circumstances of our 9 C1
maritime industries at that time, whether or not wecan agree to continue in it beyond that date.(iii)  Second-hand ships over 20 years of age should not count against the quota and those between 10and 20 years should count for only half theirtonnage.4. It is my impression that the two questions of transit controland shipping are those to which you have attached most importance butthey have presented grave difficulties to us and I should find it most difficult to justify our acceptance unless I could present it to publicopinion as part of a satisfactory settlement including other outstanding issues.5. As regards copper wire, we have, as you know, published thecontinued embargo on copper and copper semis as part of an arrangement under which copper wire was put on List III.    We cannot in thesecircumstances accept the re-imposition of embargo.    There would bevery considerable criticism in this country if we were to re-impose it so soon after the item had been freed and as soon as a fair (but in our viewnot excessive) volume of trade had developed.    We have, however, sought for some way of meeting you and have now announced in the Co-co-ordinating committee of the Paris Group (COCOIVl) our readiness to reconsider thepossibility of List II treatment as soon as the global figure of exportapprovals for 1955 reaches a figure of 50,000 tons.    This compares withan annual consumption of copper wire (all types) of some 600,000 tons inthe U0S,A, and 150,000 tons here.    I very much hope that your delegation to COCOM will accept this.6. Finally I must confess to being disappointed by the result of thediscussion and your recent letter on rolling mills.    It seems a pity that.,when our views on the general criteria seemed in the summer to be closeenough to secure a satisfactory settlement on other items, there should nowbe such a wide divergence on this.    We cannot agree with your assessment of the strategic importance of these mills.    They are basic industrial equipment and do not differ in principle from the range of metal working and other machinery which we have already agreed to free; this applies particularly to the cold strip mills.    We do not believe that there is any longer any worthwhile strategic gain in trying to restrict the expansion ofthe Soviet economy in this field, nor that the embargo you propose has any significant effect on Soviet ability or readiness to wage war.    Neverthelessas part of an overall settlement, I am sending you a compromise in the formof a list of particular types which I would be prepared to keep underembargo.   Our industry are aware that the talks are going on and I do not know how much longer we can defend the continuance of embargo over sowide a field.    The item is due to be discussed some time in COCOM butI very much hope that we could at least narrow our own differences first,and that you will be able to support this compromise in COCOM:-&quot; Metal rolling mills as follows(a)  seamless tube mills, and cold tube reducing and expanding mills;
I &quot;3(b)  plate, strip, sheet and foil mills, as follows:.-(i)  plate mills having a roll face width of48&quot; or more;(ii)   continuous 4-high strip mills having aroll face width of 48&quot; or more;(iii) having work rolls rotating in a planetaryform around the back-up rolls;(iv)  having the work rolls supported bymultiple back-up rolls or bearings;(v) having work rolls of 3&quot; diameter or less;(vi) having driven back-up rolls&quot;.7. You will see from the above proposals that we are nothesitating to put the need for a mutual understanding on these issuesin front of both our own interests and our pressing domestic difficultiesin these matters.    You and I have had to move a long way to meet eachother before and I hope we can do so again on this occasion.    Above alllet us try to reach a comprehensive settlement of these outstandingdifficulties.    To continue to debate them, or for me to announce that v/eare. making concessions on them one by one, will exacerbate our difficulties here and will certainly tend to blur what is I believe theclarity of our common purpose.      Ends.
