Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1954SECRET Copy No.   76C. (54) 39516th December, 1954CABINETTHE PRODUCTION OF POWER FROM NUCLEAR ENERGYMemorandum by the Lord President of the council a report on the prospect for the development of nuclear power over the next10-20 years has recently been prepared by a Working Party consisting of officials of the departments principally concerned and of representatives of the atomic energy Authority. The report has been discussed by the Ministerial Committeeon Atomic Energy (A.E. (M) (54) 5th Meeting) and by the Atomic energy authority, both of which endorse its conclusions.2. The report is confined to the civil application of nuclear energy. Themain points which emerge are:  (a) The generation of electricity by nuclear methods can now be accepted astechnically feasible and has a good chance of proving, within the next10 years, competitive with electricity generated by conventionalmethods.(b) The electric generating capacity in the United Kingdom will in any case have to be increased to about three times the present size during thenext 20 years to meet the growth of the demand for electricity. Inthe absence of nuclear power, coal consumption by the power stations would rise in the same period from the present level of 36 million tonsa year to about 100 million tons a year, so placing an increasing andprobably intolerable strain on the coal industry.(c) A realistic programme of nuclear power stations for the 10 years to 1965would involve capital expenditure of the order of  300 millions.The initial step, which would cost about  50 millions, would consistof two power stations, which would be modified and improved versionsof the type now being built, partly for military purposes, at Calder Hall.The stations would be started in 1957 and completed about 1960-61.A decision to proceed would be required within the next few months.(d) These stations would be followed by further groups of two, four and fourstations at about 18 months&apos; intervals. Each group should show considerable technical advances on preceding groups.(e) Such a 10-year programme would achieve, by 1965, an annual saving of coal of the order of 5-6 million tons. There should also be a saving, perhaps  100 millions, of capital expenditure by the british electricity Authority (BEA) and the National Coal Board (NCB)which would offset a part of the  300 millions capital expenditure onthe programme. The running costs would be significantly lower thanthe running costs of conventional stations.(/) Further expansion of nuclear power stations could follow and might leadto a saying of coal of the order of 40 million tons by the mid-1970&apos;s a substantial contribution to the rapidly increasing demand for furtherpower stations.(g) The availability and price of the basic material, uranium, are important considerations in assessing the feasibility and economic justification ofsuch a nuclear power programme.  One of the main aims of technical47364
development will be to increase the efficiency of use of uranium, forwhich there is considerable scope, and this in its turn should lead to more economical nuclear power and will limit the long-term demandfor uranium.(h) Any programme of nuclear power development should be kept as flexibleas possible. The rapid rate of development of nuclear techniques means that even the initial stages of the programme outlined can only beregarded as indicating the probable line of advance, and not as a plandetermined in final detail.(/) It is important to embark on a civil programme now in order to ensurethat this country is in the forefront of the development of this newtechnology. In addition to the economic advantages for the fuelsituation at home, there would be the commercial advantage of puttingour engineering consultants and industry in the position to sell abroadpower reactors and the associated plant, equipment, materials and technology, and there would also clearly be a political advantage in being first in the field, which should enhance our influence in bothforeign and Commonwealth countries.(/) It is not necessarily desirable to attempt to build up the maximum numberof nuclear power stations as quickly as possible in order to achieve aquick saving in coal. The really important consideration is that, while making an early start on an industrial programme, we should also move forward in the development of more advanced designs as rapidly aspossible. In this way alone shall we achieve most effectively the manybenefits which the development of nuclear power will eventually make possible.3. The civil programme, as put forward, is self-contained in that the fissile material (plutonium) produced in the early stages of the programme will be needed for the reactors operating in the later stages. Military requirements are at presentformulated only so far as 1960-61 and will be met from the output of existing facilities or those being built at wind scale, Calder Hall and Capenhurst.4. If the military demand for fissile material were to be increased, theAuthority might be able to meet the additional requirement from the output of aprototype reactor which they will be building in any case for the civil programme.If this were started in 1957, significant quantities of plutonium should be available by 1961. If this source seemed likely to be inadequate, the Authority would propose to meet any additional military demand by building additional reactorsspecifically for military purposes, the reactors being of the same type as those being built, either as prototypes or for commercial operation, for the civil programme.5. While it would be possible in an emergency for fissile material to be taken from the civil reactors for military purposes, this could not be done withoutdisrupting the development of the civil programme. It should, however, bepossible to build up distinct military and civil programmes as described above,providing the military requirement can be formulated sufficiently far in advance.The method proposed would, moreover, enable the best use to be made of thescarce skilled man-power, where a clash between the two programmes could mosteasily occur, as the reactors required for the two programmes would be ofv thesame design.6. On the basis of the above considerations, the Ministerial Committee on atomic Energy recommended that we should embark on a civil nuclear programmeof the general type set out above. If this recommendation is accepted, action will need to be taken on the following:  (a) arrangements will have to be made between the Atomic Energy authority and the B.E.A. about building and operating the stations;(b) immediate action would have to be taken by the Atomic energy authority to ensure the necessary supplies of uranium in good time.Vigorous action will be necessary both with the suppliers and in thenegotiations with the United States over the allocation of supplies;but if this is done, we can expect to obtain the quantities of uraniumrequired;(c) action will also have to be taken by the Atomic Energy Authority invarious other directions, but no serious difficulties are expected.&quot;
7. It would also be desirable to make a public statement, possibly in theform of a White Paper, describing the Government^ intentions. This statement,,which will have to be made after the proposals have been discussed with theB.E.A., might be made soon after Parliament reassembles in January.8. I commend these proposals to my colleagues and ask the Cabinet to giveauthority:(i) for an immediate start to be made on a civil programme of the typedescribed above for the production of power from nuclear energy;(ii) for discussions to be started with the B.E.A. on this basis;(iii) for the preparation of a statement for publication outlining our proposals.S.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,15 th December, 1954.
