CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYlS government secret. (54) 382 COPY NO. 6o7th December, 1954CABINETBRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSION:RAILWAY WAGE negotiations memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Serviceand the Minister of Transport and Civil AviationLast December the Government intervened in the dispute on wagesbetween the British Transport Commission and the Railway Unions, follow-ing rejection by the Unions of an award by the Railway Staff NationalTribunal.    As a result an agreement was negotiated which gave the staff 6 per cent increase including the award of the Tribunal.    At the sametime, the Commission and the Unions agreed together to examine thewhole railway wage and salary structure with a view to removinganomalies, increasing incentives, and securing greater efficiency by all appropriate means.2.        These further negotiations dragged on for many months withoutagreement being in sight, until Sir Brian Robertson increased his offer and reached a substantial measure of agreement with the Transport andSalaried Staffs Association and with the National Union of Railwaymen(N.U.R.),    The Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemendecided, however, at a late stage to pursue their claim for footplate staffthrough the Railway Staff National Tribunal, and they have now received an award which is considerably better than anything the Commission wereprepared to offer in negotiation.3.        Despite the agreement reached over a wide field between theCommission and the Executive of the N.U.R., the Union have now told theCommission that the agreement is unacceptable to their membership, andthat they have received instructions to re-submit their original proposals,which are considerably in excess of anything the Commission have so far been prepared to agree.    At the same time, resolutions have been passedby a number of the larger branches of the Union threatening strike action if their claim is not conceded in full.4.        The Commission are now considering their next moves in thelight of the award to the footplate men by the Railway Staff NationalTribunal (which they will, no doubt, accept) and the fresh claim by theN.U.R.    The agreement so far reached with the Transport and SalariedStaffs Association is interim in character and provides that there shall bea thorough review of the salary structure, including the basis ofclassification.5.&apos;       In the further negotiations with the N.U.R. the Commission will seek to make the best settlement they can, but a breakdown may occur atany time.    A strike over the Christmas period may take place and forthis reason we have thought it right to bring these matters to the noticeof the Cabinet.
6a        The financial position of the Commission is such that, apart fromthe effect of the recent award of the Railway Staff National Tribunal, theCommission are already likely to show a deficit of the order of  15 millions this year and an even greater sum next year and in successive years.    TheUnions are aware of the financial position of the Commission but consider   &apos;that, if necessary, there should be a Government subsidy to meet theincreased wages bill.     Their view is that there is not at present reasonablerelativity between railway wages and those of other industries.7.        Whatever may be the result of the further negotiations betweenthe Commission and the Unions, we consider that the Commission should beleft to conduct those negotiations, and that if the negotiations break downand a strike seems inevitable the Government should not bring pressure to bear on the Commission to give way to the Union&apos;s demands so as toavoid the threat of strike action.     The Commissions authority in negotiation was weakened by the intervention of the Government last december, and if there is further intervention of the same kind on this occasion the bargaining position of the Commission will virtually be destroyed.    Moreover, the Unions would then have good reason to suppose that, having obtained all they can from the Commission, the threat to strike will always induce the Government to compel theCommission to improve their offer and, if necessary, put the cost on the taxpayer.W.M.6th December, 1954.
