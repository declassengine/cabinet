secret.(54) 381 COPY NO. 7 O7th December. 1954CABINETEAST/WEST TRADE; STRATEGIC controls memorandum by the Firsx Lord of the Admiralty and theMinister of Transport and Civil aviation the President of the Board of Trade in C. (54) 3 73 suggests thatin order to obtain an agreement with the Americans and to obtain some concessions from them in respect of copper wire and rolling mills weshould abandon completely our stand on shipping.    In our view this wouldbe wrong, apart from, the grave political repercussions which would haveto be faced.2.        The concession might not immediately affect the merchant ship-building industry, foi- which the First Lord is responsible; but there wouldbe immediate repercussions on sales of second-hand ships with which theMinister of Transport and Civil Aviation is concerned.    26,000 tons of second-hand shipping have been sold to Russia during the last 5-6 months.These second-hand sales are important to the shipping industry as a means of financing new construction and so helping to modernise themerchant fleet.3.        By agreeing that Denmark may build for Russia a limited numberof ships with speeds in excess of 15^- knots, the Americans have made itdifficult to defend in public the proposition that the acquisition of such ships by Russia constitutes a military danger to the Western Powers.4.        This by itself is bad enough but we are also being asked to acceptquantitative restrictions which are no less difficult to defend.    We are theworld&apos;s biggest ship-builders and ship-operators.    We are at presentbuilding 38 per cent of the merchant shipping under construction in thewox*ld and we operate 23 per cent of the world&apos;s active tonnage.    It isasking a lot of us to accept a quota no bigger than that of Belgium and Italy swho are building 2 per cent and 3 per cent respectively of the world&apos;stonnage under construction;  and, what is even less defensible, to guaranteean exceptional share of the market to the Dutch, who are building 9 per.cent of world tonnage, simply because they choose to conduct trade negotiationswith Russia by barter.5.        In face of the strong opposition to be expected from ship-building and shipping interests and the trades unions, it would be difficult to defendthese proposals in Parliament or in the country.    They would moreovergive a handle to anti-American opinion and, in the event of unemploymentlater developing in the ship-building areas, would expose us to thecharge of having abandoned this important industry!s interest underAmerican pressure.
6n        We appreciate the force of the President of the Board of Trade&apos;desire to settle all outstanding points at one time but the obvious unfairnessto this country of the proposals with respect to ship-building and shippingseems to us to indicate that rather than come to a settlement on them onthese terms it would be better to leave both of them out of the proposedpackage deal and retain the present ship-building and shipping controls,,J oPoLaT,J.A0B.-C.6th December, 1954,
