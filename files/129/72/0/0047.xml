/c-T(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)secret.(54) 39718th December, 1954^CABINETPRICE OF SUGARMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 6th December the Cabinet invited me to consider, inconsultation with the Minister of Food, the suggestions which had beenput forward in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion with a view to avoiding an increasein the retail price of sugar and to submit my recommendations to theCabinet (0.0,(54) 82nd Conclusions, Minute 5),20     I append a note agreed by officials of the Treasury and theMinistry of Food on the two proposals made by the Cabinet, namely:-(a) transferring supplies of sugar to the strategicstockpile;(b) pressing the refiners to bear some part of any increased costs out of their profits,,This no+e makes it clear that even on the most optimistic assumptionswe could not secure any significant relief in either of these ways; andany transfer to the stockpile is of course of no assistance to the Exchequersince the money would still have to be found out of Votes,    We thereforestill have to decide whether to increase the price of sugar to the consumeror whether to leave the retail price unaltered and carry the resulting loss on the Ministry of Food Vote,    The arguments for and against these courses are in the Minister of Food&apos;s memorandum, C,(54) 363,3,      The Minister of Food and I had previously considered thepossibility of increasing our strategic reserves of sugar and the rate atwhich sugar might be moved into the stockpile.    Our present and prospective supplies of sugar are very adequate;  but if we put 500,000 tonsinto strategic reserve immediately we should have little or no protection against a serious crop failure and might be forced to buy dollar sugar.To insure against this possibility, at any rate for some years to come, Ihave agreed with the Minister of Food that the stockpile should be built up at the rate of 100,000 tons annually over the next j?ive years.    This should give us reasonable protection against having to buy dollar sugar for thatperiod,   . The cost of handling and storing this sugar will in any event haveto be met out of Votes, and I could not agree to run any risk on the balanceof payments merely in order to transfer the storage and handling charges from the Ministry of Food&apos;s Main Vote to the Vote for Strategic Reserves.COPY NO.
4. Unless we have some reason for believing that Tate and Lyle&apos;sprofits are unreasonable, I do not think that we could ask them to bearany significant part of the increase in the price of sugar050     I therefore recommend:-(a) that the price of sugar should be increased assoon as possible by ^d. a lb, retailj(b) that any remaining deficit on the trading account should be met from the Ministry of Food!main Vote;(c) that the stockpiling programme should proceed on the lines outlined in paragraph 3 above,R.A.B,Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.16th December, 1954.APPENDIXPrice of SugarReport by Officials&quot;We have considered the Cabinet&apos;s suggestions,2.      Transfers to the Stockpile.    The maximum amount that could betransferred to the stockpile is 500,000 tons.    If this amount were to betransferred from commercial stocks tc strategic reserve from, say,1st January, 1955 at the average c. i.f. (cost9   insurance, freight) priceof Commonwealth sugar of  43 per ton?&quot;(a) the trading deficit for 1954-55 would be reduced from  5, 6 millions to  5,2 millions;(b) the trading deficit for 1955-56 would be reduced from  9. 1 millions to  7,6 millions;(c) a Supplementary Estimate for 1954-55 on the strategic Reserves Vote for  21.7 millions would be necessary.13.      Refiners&apos; Profits.     In the financial year ending September, 1953   iTate and Lyle^ gross profits for a 52 week year were  3.4 millions,the dividend was 16 per cent and  657,000 was distributed to shareholders!For the financial year ending September, 1954 gross profits for a 53 weekyear were  4.4 millions, the dividend was 18 per cent and  734,000 was distributed to shareholders.    In 1953-54 some 40 per cent of Tate andLyle&apos;s total business was in the export trade and a considerable
lQ(oproportion of their profits no doubt derives from this.    Their profit margin on home sales has been restricted,, by an agreement made withthe Ministry of Food in terms approved by the Treasury, to 2/3 d. percwt. , and to meet even one-third of the estimated trading deficit for1955-56, after allowing for the maximum transfer to the stockpile,their margin would have to be cut from 2/3jd0 to l/-d.    The profit margin can be re-considered, at the request of either party, after31st March, 1955, but the Ministry of Food have no reason to thinkthat it is unreasonable,4o      The Treasury would object on balance of payments grounds toimmobolising 500,000 tons of sugar in the stockpile; but even if this were to be done and if the refiners could be persuaded to bear eachyear, say  250,000 of the increased cost of sugar out of their profits,there would still be a trading loss of  5. 1 millions in 1954-55 and 7. 35 millions in 1955-56,    This deficit must be met either by theconsumer or from the Ministry of Food Vote.    An increase by fd. per lb.. retail would produce  7.7 millions in 1955-56.    If the increasewere to be made as from 1st January, 1955, it would produce 1.9 millions in 1954-55 and there would thus be a trading deficit inthe current year which will in any event have to be carried on theMlinistry of Food Vote.16th December, 1954.
