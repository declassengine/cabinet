(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(54) 358 COPY NO._Q23rd November, 1954CABINETMILITARY JET AIRCRAFT FOR THE MIDDLE east memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 27th October the Defence Committee approved the releaseto Egypt of 20 Meteor fighters, 3 Meteor trainers and 22 Vampire fighters(out of 38 Vampires ordered)     (D. (54) 6th Meeting, Item 1).    These air-craft had been ordered in 1950 at which time a substantial deposit was paidby the Egyptian Government for the 45 aircraft concerned,     The aircraft were not delivered to Egypt owing to the imposition of the arms embargo on Egypt which was lifted on 30th August this year.2. In addition there is an outstanding request from the SyrianGovernment for 20 Meteor day-fighters which were ordered in July but onwhich we deferred a decision in the hope that the French Government mightthereby be persuaded to abandon their proposal to supply Mystere aircraft to Israel (since Mystere aircraft are more modern than any military air-craft at present in the Middle East, including our own).     The FrenchGovernment are, however, apparently determined to supply these aircraft to Israel though the exact position as regards delivery is not yet known.3. I made it clear in the debate in the House of Commons on 2nd November (in reply to strong views expressed about the danger of supplying arms to Egypt) that we should make arms deliveries to the ArabNations only on the basis of the 1950 Tripartite Declaration, i. e. , that weshould continue to keep the balance as between Israel and the Arab States.My object was to prevent an arms race in that part of the world;  and toreduce tension in the area as a first step towards Arab-Israeli settlement.4. If jet aircraft were supplied to Egypt as proposed by the DefenceCommittee, and if the Syrian order for Meteors were fulfilled, therespective jet strength in fighters would appear to work out for the future as follows:-Israel18 Meteors (11 now -f 7 Meteors approved last January and nowawaiting export licence fromthe United Kingdom).4-    unknown number of Mysteres   (12 believed to be on contract).Arabs55 Meteors or Vampirest 45 &quot;      &quot; &quot;       .    for Egypt20 Meteors proposed for Syria (delivery to be spread over some three years).
5. If Egypt and Syria now receive a further 65 jet aircraft theArab countries will overwhelmingly out-number Israel in jets.    In myopinion such deliveries would increase the danger of an arms race andconsequently increase rather than reduce tension in the ivliddie East.    Inthe circumstances I consider that despite the ill will which this will causein Egypt, the Egyptian Government should be allowed at the very most the3 Meteor trainers and not more than half the total number of fighters;indeed I would prefer the number to be less than half.    Deliveries toSyria should in my view be closely related to deliveries of Mysteres to Israel on which further information should be sought.    Subject to that itmight be possible to authorise the delivery of the Meteors to Syria ifthis were spread out in time so that only 8 reached Syria by the end of1955.6. I consider that the Near East Arms Co-ordinating Committeein Washington, on which the Americans, French and ourselves are represented, should be asked  (a) to establish the position about the deliverof Mysteres from France to Israel,   (b) to consider the whole position about orders from Middle East States and   (c) to make recommendationsbased on maintaining a proper balance of strength in the area.Re commendations7. I therefore recommend that the Cabinet should agree   -(i)  that Egypt should receive 3 Meteor trainers andat the very most not more than half the 42 Meteorand Vampire fighters;(ii)  that deliveries of Meteors to Syria should be related to any deliveries of Mysteres by france to Israel;(iii)   that the attached draft telegram should be despatched to Washington requesting Her Majesty&apos;s governments views as set forth above to be brought before the near east Arms Co-ordinating Committee.Foreign Office, S.W.1.23rd November, 1954.
Arms for Middle Eastern States.Her Majesty&apos;s Government have reconsidered the position about outstanding orders and requests for military aircraft from Egypt,Israel and Syria.(a) Egypt.    The following are on order for the egyptian government and deposits on them were also paid four years ago:&quot;20 Meteor VIII Fighters22 Vampire Day Fighters3 Meteor T7 TrainersSome decision must now be reached about these long outstanding orders.I am not prepared to authorise delivery of all these 45 jet aircraft inpresent circumstances.    Although delivery would no doubt be spread overa considerable period the decision of Her Majesty&apos;s Government wouldbecome known and would appear to be a massive reinforcement of Arabair strength at a time when Arab-Israel tension is still so great.    It isimportant to maintain the balance with Israel and this turns on the questionof what reinforcement exactly Israel herself is to receive from France -see paragraph 4 below.    Subject to this a possible solution might be to release the three Trainers and at the very most not more than half(repeat half) the total number of Fighters, although I would prefer thenumber to be less.    (Since two separate British aircraft companies are involved it would probably be necessary instead of authorising either the Meteors or the Vampires to offer the Egyptian Government the releaseof a proportion of each).(b) Syria.    There is an outstanding request from the SyrianGovernment for 20 Meteor Day Fighters of which 8 would be for deliveryin 1955 and the rest in later years.    These were originally requested bythe Syrian Government last July (my telegram Mo. 3 806).    The decision was deferred by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the hope that the FrenchGovernment might thereby be persuaded to abandon their proposal to supplyMystere aircraft to Israel.    The French Government^ apparentdetermination to deliver these aircraft to Israel (aide-memoire from theQuai d&apos;Orsay enclosed in letter of September 25 from Head of Chancery,Paris) makes it difficult to refuse some satisfaction to Syria.    I might beprepared to authorise delivery of the Meteors on the basis that this wasspread out in time so that only 8 reached Syria by the end of 1 955.However, deliveries must be closely related to the deliveries of Mysteresto Israel.4. Please bring before the Near East Arms Co-co-ordinating committee the views of Her Majesty&apos;s Government as set out above.I consider that it is the duty of the Committee to establish the facts aboutthe delivery of Mysteres from France to Israel, as on this may turn thebalance of air power between Arabs and Israelis.    I would like theCommittee to go on to consider the whole position about these orders andto make recommendations based on maintaining a proper balance of strength in the area.
