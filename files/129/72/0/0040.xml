I should be glad to know the Cabinet&apos;s HAV?B iew upon them. ^I 70 Downing Street, S.W. 1,December 12, 1954. ^L-WI 1;  The only sane policy in the next few years is Defence through Deterrents. wMMM^L\w His we have already adopted and although we ourselves have no effective nuclear JKVwMMM Herrents we are making progress.  Meanwhile the United States has probably  MMM^L\w lleast five times the nuclear power of Soviet Russia.  Our moral and scientific ^k*m^L\W Kport of the United States and presently British possession of nuclear weapons wMMMH Bthe highest quality and on an appreciable scale, together with their means of I^L\w Hivery (though these are under serious reproach) should greatly reinforce the IH Hterrent power of the free world.

2. The danger of the next two or three years is that the United States, ^ee i |]} ^hitself being caught up by the Soviet Government, should make a forestalling nuclearB fa^^|attack on Russia, and might be provoked by some episode in China.  We shouldH (ohBSbIassume that the United States would be restrained by their strong moral andHspiritual convictions from such an act. They might even be prepared to make aflI Declaration, in which we should join, that they (and NATO) will never be theHseiHfirst to use nuclear weapons except in reply to a major act of aggression. That utHcnHany rate is the policy we should pursue and at the right moment proclaim. I colI 3.  A more grievous and less improbable peril is that Soviet Russia, fearing HalHI a nuclear attack before she has caught up the United States arid created, either Hc lI through equality or &quot; Saturation,&quot; deterrents of her own, should attempt to bridge Mex^^Bf^H the gulf by a surprise nuclear attack.  American superiority in nuclear weapons, lSl_L^|presently to be reinforced by the British, must be so organised as to make it c! 1that no surprise nuclear attack could prevent immediate retaliation on a far largerH jn^^Hscale.  This is an essential of the deterrent policy-our only hope. I ce^^|4. For this purpose not only must the nuclear superiority of the NAT()Ha^^^HPowers be stimulated in every possible way but their means of delivery of bombs Hsn^^Hmust be expanded, improved, and varied. Smaller varieties should be designed lw_L^|capable of being carried by bombers from any large-scale airfield without theHar^^Hnecessity of making the tell-tale prolongation of the take-off concrete track. Bases Ishould be established in as many parts of the world as possible. Camouflage Ishould be used to convey the impression of numbers as well as to disguise reality. IIt is probable, though we have not been told details, that a great deal of this has II already been done by the United States;   We should aid them in every possible I ^^fl????I i JhBsI5. The Soviet Government should certainlybe informed, though not in detail,B tiBSBsiof the policy that is being pursued and of our power to achieve it. Thus the\?should be convinced that a surprise attack could not exclude immediate retaliation. ? tj-j^^fl&quot; Although you might kill millions of our peoples and cause widespread havocI 0i^^|by a surprise attack, we certainly could within four hours of this outrage deliverH w^^|five times the weight of nuclear material which you have used, and continue ? evftsBslretaliation on that scale. We have already hundreds of bases for attack from allfl th&amp;SBslangles and have made an intricate study of suitable targets.&quot; This would makeHthe Deterrent effective except in the case of lunatics, or dictators or plotters in the! r&apos;^^flkind of position of Hitler in his final phase. I m^^|6. The question of how and when this information should be imparted to the!Soviets requires consideration. Perhaps they know already. Perhaps a talk, formalHr^^| or informal, between some of our scientists, strictly limited as to detail, and someH ai^^Hof theirs, might be a method.  Such conversations might accompany a top levelH f^Hconference for peaceful co-existence, and for measures to sustain it. I7. It seems an unwise and useless procedure for NATO Governments tofl qi^^|spread alarm through the free world without having definite practical measures it;l b^^|mind and in hand.  Much has already become public, but the truth is happily M cc^^Mmingled with fiction and exaggeration to so great an extent that panic has notH
I Www^Hn  occurred. The world goes on its daily journey in spite of a remote doom-laden^HUp impression,   It would be foolish to destroy this uncertainty by publishing precise^Hild facts and details which have not yet leaked without having some practical policy^HKj to declare at the same time. -J .si *a        8.   I was informed by our nuclear experts early in August of the developments^|he    set forth in the Minister of Defence&apos;s paper of December 9.   They are how^?at    embellished by the statements of the effects of &quot;fall out&quot; and the intricateconsequences of windborne radio-active matter on animals, on grass and vegetables,and the passing on of these conjtagions to human beings through food, thus^Her    confronting measureless numbers who have escaped all direct effects of the^Hge    explosions with poisoning or starvation or both.   Here again the only cure is1^    successful Deterrents.^Har        9.   The broad effect of all the latest developments is to spread almost^Her indefinitely and at least to a vast extent the area of mortal danger.  This shouldcertainly increase the deterrent upon Soviet Russia by putting her enormous spaces mm\^H() and scattered population on an equality or near-equality of vulnerability with our^H)s mall densely-populated Island and with Western Europe.  It is an ironic fact that mW\^Kd we have reached a stage in this topic where safety may well be the child of terrpr,^Hie and existence the twin brother of annihilation.   Here again all depends upon^H;s Deterrents, immune against surprise and well understood by all persons on both^H&gt;e sides who have the power to control events.i: - to mmPART II ?Ml. J&amp;k ?1. It is on the foregoing general background that we should consider the MMH     practical problems of the Western front.  The Soviets are between five and tenwKWtimes as strong as the NATO forces.  They could, if they so decided, advance WW^h&apos;-v    across Germany and the Low Countries and through France to the sea and toAtlantic. This would of course be a major war, with hundreds of thousands^H,c    of allied troops killed or captured and all Western Europe north of the Pyrenees,Her with all its capitals, falling into Russian hands. No-one can believe that these^B&apos;jj events would occur, whether the Russians used nuclear weapons or not, without^LW the whole nuclear power of the United States, and of Britain (when we have^Hf   anything worth speaking of) being thrown in, with the consequent Soviet?ie    rejoinder.  The reaction of this colossal and measureless event upon the Soviet MMmilitary advance might be to bring it to a standstill in confusion.  It is probable,^Hie   however, that in the next two years the Soviet nuclear attack would be concentrated^mWn\       Britain with measureless but certainly immense local destruction.  That is at^Hie   any rate a belief which the Russians would not be likely to discourage.2. People say: &quot; What is the use of maintaining conventional forces atimmense expense when the issue will only be settled in the atomic sphere? &quot; This^Ho query overlooks the fact that unless NATO maintains a front which could onjv^H&gt;! be broken by a major act of war, the Communist forces could peter forward gaining^Hy control of largCindefinite areas and populations. There must be a line drawn m MM^H)t break which w|B require a Russian military effort on a large scale.   This will ^M
prevent the seepage above mentioned.   It would also require discernible ^LmW^LmWa preliminary Soviet troop movements, which would give the immediate Alert, and Ithis is of undoubted value to the stronger nuclear power. The conclusion which ^^Bmay be drawn here is that though our conventional forces are only a fraction of ^^Bthe Russian, they nevertheless play a vital part in our security.  They must be ^^BBBBJ strong enough to prevent surprise or infiltration. BftB^LmmM                  3.  On the other hand I cannot conceive that the Russians, if they were ^^Bresolved on mortal war, would be so foolish as either to make a sudden attack ^LmWonly with their front-line conventional elements or reveal their intent by the ^LmW^-mm            preliminary reinforcing moves essential to their initial success.   If they were I ^LmWBVH            resolved to stake all, as they would have to do, on a sudden assault, why should ^^B^LmW            they throw away their only chance while they are the weaker nuclear power of I ^^B^LmWm            surprise by Hydrogen bombs? ^LmW^Lmm9 4.  The picture sometimes presented to us of war beginning by a sudden I ^^B^LmW conventional attack on the Western front with or without preparatory movements I ^^B^^B is wholly unreal.  There is therefore no real need for our military Commanders I ^^B^^B to claim the authority to turn on nuclear weapons without the sanction of I ^^B^LmW governments. It may well be that the fourteen governments concerned would be I ti^^B^L\W well advised to entrust this decision to two or three of their number, possibly B ii^^lthe NATO Standing Grour^of^ftest of all to the United States and Britain, who I^LmW alone possess the nuclear weapon (Britain as yet on a petty scale). ^Lmm\^^B 5.  It may also be asked: &quot; If the Russians can gain nothing and only spoil I ^^BmmWM their nuclear surprise on the Western front, why do they maintain these enormous I fie^^H^Lkm and costly conventional forces?&quot; The answer seems simple. The fact that Russia IhisHBfl^LmW is far weaker in the nuclear sphere makes it all the more necessary for her to gain BovcHat the outset territorial hostages from the West.  If, during and in spite of the B o(Bfl^Lkm confusion of the nuclear war, they were able to occupy Paris and Brussels and KheBBfl^LyW spread themselves out over the conquered lands, they would, have an important flaariBVJmWgM counter for negotiation, and bases for the discharge at Britain of missiles very I BBB^LmW injurious and additional to their atomic stockpile.  Moreover it is probable that I ^LmWBBJ even at this stage the Allies would be shy of dropping a Hydrogen bomb on the I BBB^LmW Bois de Boulogne, and thus destroying the population of Paris. ^LmW^^B                  6.  Therefore I conclude that the Soviets have a good reason for maintaining I ^LmWM^Lkm the means to make a conventional attack on Western Europe, and that the I ^^BBBf| NATO powers would be most unwise not to present at any rate a delaying front B ^LmW^LmW till their nuclear superiority should manifest itself. ^LmWM^Lkm                  7.  We must now look at the structure of the NATO defensive force.   It I ^LmW^k*m already possesses nuclear artillery, and it is probable the Russians have also! /BY!similarly equipped their forces.   Some Americans argue that nuclear artillery! VA|^LyW including field rockets, is only a modern expahsion of artillery firing high explosives,! ^LmWBBf| and that no new principle is involved in firing more powerful shells at a hostile! Bag^LmW army in the field. I have always contended&apos;that even though the use of nuclear! ^^B^LmW weapons is confined to combatants and only incidentally strikes the civil population! ^^B^LkM yet the multiplication of explosive power is so gigantic that a wide gulf yawns! ^^B
between the two. Anyhow, the other side would be the judge of whether it paidhim to treat the use of nuclear artillery against him as the beginning of wholesaleI       nuclear war.8.  But the authority for which the NATO Commanders are asking is muchwider than the use of nuclear artillery.   There are three sections of nuclearI    I warfare:-First, nuclear artillery, including rocket missiles,^^fl I        Second, the use on a great scale of nuclear bombs by the Tactical AirForce, and L^HThird, the Strategic Nuclear Air Force.L^H    I To give the right to decide on launching the nuclear attack by the Tactical Air II Force to the NATO Commanders would undoubtedly give them the power to H?1 ? begin, without consulting their Governments, WORLD NUCLEAR WAR.I Hitherto there has been an impression that nuclear artillery firing at combatantsIs I might be accepted by both sides, but no one can possibly believe that the Tactical IBi I Air Force, which is planned to carry hundreds of Hydrogen bombs and double^^Be I the number of Atomics, is in the same class as nuclear artillery.   It is indeedBy ? indistinguishable from the main Strategic Nuclear Air Force, and it would be follyI to use the one without the other. L^HH ? 9. It would surely be impossible at this stage to obtain agreement with theH)il I Soviets that nuclear artillery could be recognised on both sides as belonging to the IH1^ ? field of conventional armaments. General Gruenther considers that it gives him^^V!a Bhis only chance of making an effective defence for a short time against the existing^^B&quot;n ?overwhelming conventional forces of his potential opponents. In fact it is no^^Bhe Hgood imagining that it could be separated in principle or practice from the rest of^^Bnd Bthe atomic field. This could only be included in a much larger and deeper^^?ant ?agreement on the problem as a whole.???Very I^^Hhat ? 4 10.  To sum up this portion of the argument:L^h ^e I    (a) We should not agree to invest NATO Commanders with the right to useI nuclear weapons, including nuclear artillery, without the sanction of^^Kiingl the governments under whom they serve.  They must plan for boththeB alternatives.  They may deploy for the full one,^^?rontl    (b) To prevent delay by a large number of Powers who have nothing tocontribute in this sphere, we should seek a devolution of authorityI upon two or three nations, preferably the only two who have any L^Hnuclear strength to offer.^^B,,   ?   (c) We and the Americans should seek an opportunity of discussing the issue^^?llery.l wjtn ^e Soviets on the highest level at the earliest practicable date.^^?sives,! Time should not be wasted as it is both short and deadly.  They are^^?ostikH certainly catching up, both in nuclear weapons and their delivery, with ^^fl^^?icleail every month that passes, and although they may not overtake the^^?atioaB United States, with British reinforcements approaching, they may^H&apos;aw&gt;,l easily reach a &quot; saturation &quot; point where, although one Power is
mmm Wmwmmmm W$M         stronger than the other, both are capable of inflicting mortal injury. I ^LwMWMwM The grave mistake was in not coming to terms with Russia when the I ^Lmm^LwM United States had the Atomics and they had none. ^LwM^L^Lw 11.  In attempting to forecast the conduct of the Soviet Government, who I WMjM^L^m have absolute executive power, it is prudent to study what their real interest is. I ^m%M^kwM No one can doubt that they will have a far better chance of world domination if I WMW^L^Lm they wait until they have overtaken the United States in nuclear weapons or at I ^mmmI least have achieved &quot; saturation.&quot;  It would indeed be folly for them not to wait I Bm\^mWM for two or three years. We therefore need not take immediate alarm at Molotov&apos;s I ^mWMwMjm rough words, designed no doubt to play upon the French Chamber.  The next I ^mWM^LwM two or three years may well be the safest the world will see for a long time. ^LwrnWmW We should remain calm and firm. -^LwMi Sgg                                            w. s. c. ^Lm
