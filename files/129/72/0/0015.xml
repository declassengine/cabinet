[top secretH Id. (54) H^^B November, 1954CABINET^--\ Defence Committee^LW I NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANISATION: AUTHORITY OF THESUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER, EUROPE ^1^-M Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs^-M B Argument^-M In the last year SACEUR has received from the Americans certain supplies ^-M^-M I   Bof atomic weapons (we do not know the exact quantities). He has also been given^-W I by them the assumptions necessary for his first studies in atomic strategy; and themmm B report by the Military Committee resulting from these studies is due to be ^-W^^B I presented to the N.A.T.O. Council of Ministers in mid-December.   This report is ^L^LX^-M B called, on instructions given by the Council &quot; The Most Effective Pattern of ^L^L\^^B BN.A.T.O. Military Strength for the next few years.&quot; fJJJJ2.  The report is not yet completed, but should be ready for approval by the ^^B^-M I Military Committee meeting in the last week of November.  The Foreign Office ^L^L\^-M I and the Chiefs of Staff have advised on its drafting.   One point it raises is of such ^^B^^B I importance that I consider it essential to bring it now to my colleagues&apos; attention. iJJJJ^^B BThis is the question of the authority to be given to SACEUR to use nuclear ^^Bm^mu mm B weapons, ^^fl^^B 3.  The relevant passages in the draft report are at Annex I.  They make the ^^fl^^B B dilemma clear.  As a military commander SACEUR states, in effect, that he must^^B Bhave in advance of the outbreak of war the approval of the fifteen governments ^^B^^B I members of N.A.T.O. to his having the ability to use nuclear weapons from the fJJJJ^^B I outset, if he is to stand a chance of victory.  On the other hand, it seems out of ^^B^^B I the question for responsible Governments to agree here and now to any statement ^^B^^B I implying the relinquishment by them of the final decision.   For the United ^^B^^B B Kingdom this would imply delegating responsibility for action, in hypothetical fJJJJiJJJJJ I circumstances, which would almost certainly bring devastation on this country, ^^B^^B I even if victory were eventually achieved; it would also mean leaving this decision ^^B^^B I to one man who, at a time of extreme crisis, might be faultily advised or misled ^^B^^B I into a terrible miscalculation.  The other N.A.T.O. Governments are likely to ^^B^^B I feel the same, and are very unlikely to be able (as recommended by the Military ^^B^^B I Committee) to approve in principle at this next meeting measures which would ^^B^^B I include the right of SACEUR to use these weapons in this way.                &amp;$v. ^^Bm^mm w I       ^&apos;  ^e danger is a&apos;l trie greater because the main nuclear striking force is and fJJJJJ^^B I will be the United States Strategic Air Force, which is not under N.A.T.O. or ^^B^^B I SACEUR&apos;s command.   Consequently, we have no control over the operations of vJJJJJ^^B I this Air Force; but we have limited agreements with the Americans on the lines ^^B^^B I described at Annex II. ^^B
mmm mm5. Finally, on 23rd April last, Mr. Dulles made a statement covering the ^-Wsubject to a private meeting of N.A.T.O. Ministers. A record is at Annex III. ^_mThere was no discussion on this statement. ^-^L\^L^Lm                Our Policy at the N.A.T.O. Council Meeting fJJJJJ6. The Chiefs of Staff are at my suggestion attempting to have the recom- I ^L^Lmmendation in the Military Committee&apos;s report that the N.A.T.O. Council &quot; approve ? ^L^Lmin principle &quot; SACEUR&apos;s right to use atomic weapons from the outset altered tothe N.A.T.O. Council &quot; accept as a basis for planning &quot; that this measure is onenecessary to adapt our military forces for a future war.  But whether the MilitaryCommittee agree to this alteration or not I think we should do all we can to 1prevent random discussion at the meeting of the Council and ourselves put forward&apos; 1 ^-^Ly|b^H               a resolution which is likely both to be acceptable to the representatives of the ^L^-other N.A.T.O. Governments and leave to SACEUR liberty to proceed with his ^-Wplanning on a realistic basis. ^-^L\7. I therefore suggest that when the Gouncil discusses this paper we shouldpropose the following resolution on this matter: -&quot;The North Atlantic Council .... accept as a basis for militaryplanning that the measures in the enclosure to the report are necessary to ^-^L\?I^H                     adapt our military forces for a future major war, but emphasise that this ^-^Lyacceptance does not remove the responsibility of SACEUR to have alternative ^-^Lyplans for a non-nuclear war nor detract from the ultimate responsibility ofMember Governments to take final decisions at the material time.&quot; ^-^LySuch a resolution would be in line with the words used by the Prime Minister H ^-^Ly^^fl               in the House on 28th October in commenting with approval on some words of ^L^LmField-Marshal Lord Montgomery&apos;s which justified planning on this basis but ^L^Lm??^1               implied no claim for the authority to use these weapons. aa^l8. At the same time we should emphasise in the Council that-^-^Ly                     (a) we do not expect an early war;^-^Ly (b) the report is only the first of a series, and later developments or changed^-^L\                             circumstances-to take an example, a universal agreement to ban the ^-^L\^^fl use of nuclear weapons-might alter the whole picture.   We wouldconclude that the risks in giving SACEUR the required authority at ^-^Ly?j^b                             present therefore outweigh the risks of not giving it. bb^|Recommendation9. It is important that we should co-ordinate our policy with the Canadian^-m               and United States Governments before the Council meeting.   I therefore ^-^Lyrecommend that we should without delay discuss the question with them on the ^-^Lylines described in paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 above; and subject to their comments,follow the line in paragraph 7 at the Council meeting ^-^LyForeign Office, S.W. 1,fJJJJ                               25th November, 1954 ^L^LXANNEX- IExtract from a Draft Report By the Military Committee on&quot;The Most EFFEcrrvE Pattern of N.A.T.O. Military Strength^-m                                            for the Next Few Years4&apos; ^-^Ly&quot; An examination, in the light of the above, of the forces likely to be at the ^-^Lydisposal of Allied Command Europe leads tothe conclusion that with the quantitiesof atomic weapons estimated to be available to these forces in the next few years,   X ^-^Ly^-M               it lies within NA.T.O.&apos;s power to provide an effective deterrent in Europe, provided????J               that: The ability to make immediate use of atomic weapons is ensured. Our^-U               studies have indicated that without their immediate use we could not successfully fl^|^-M               defend Europe within the resources available:   Any delay in their use-evenmeasured in hours-could be fatal.  Therefore, in the event of a war involving
?fl m\\\\\^LmW   I N.A.T.O. it is militarily essential that N.A.T.O. forces should be able to use atomicB^H and thermo-nuclear weapons in their defence from the outset . . . .&quot;Among the recommendations are: &quot; The Military Committee recommends^^B   I that the North Atlantic Council:^^B (a) Approve the above conclusions and note the significance of paragraph 37.k (This paragraph reads:B^B &quot; 37.  It is militarily essential that N.A.T.O. forces should be able to use^k-W I atomic and thermonuclear weapons in their defence and that N.A.T.O.military authorities should be authorised to plan and make preparationson the assumption that atomic and thermonuclear weapons will be^^B used in defence from the outset.&quot;)(b) Approve in principle the measures in the enclosure to the report as being^^B   i those most necessary to adapt our military forces for a future major^^B warANNEX II^LmW United Kingdom/United States Agreements on the Use of ^^B^^B   I Nuclear Weapons ^^B^^B As regards American operations from bases in the United Kingdom the^^B agreement was defined in a communique agreed with the United States Governmentand issued on 9th January, 1952: - ^^B^^B &quot; Under arrangements made for the common defence, the United States ^^B^^B has the use of certain bases in the United Kingdom.  We reaffirm the^^B understanding that the use of these bases in an emergency would be a matter^^B f r joint decision by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States^^B Government in the light of circumstances prevailing at the time.&quot;^^B As regards American operations from elsewhere, President Eisenhower said to^L-W the Foreign Secretary at Washington on 9th March, 1953, that in view of his^^B constitutional position he thought it would be &quot; treasonous &quot; on his part to give a^^B binding assurance to us that he would consult us in all circumstances about the use^^B of the atomic weapon.   But it would also be &quot; treasonous &quot; if he were not to^^B consult with his two strongest allies on these grave matters if the time factor in any^^B I wav permitted.  He preferred to think, not in terms of specific undertakings in ^^BB^B isolated matters, but rather in terms of constant consultation with us as world^^B conditions deteriorated.^^B I On 7th December, 1953, at Bermuda, President Eisenhower said to the Prime^^B Minister and the Foreign Secretary that the United States Government were^^B certainly not intending to take any precipitate action without due consultation with ^^B^^B their Allies..... ^^BB^B Certainly they would never use it (i.e., the atomic weapon) for an aggressive^^B purpose. . .. Certainly there should be consultation on the circumstances in which ^^B^L\w it might be used and the targets against which it should be employed.  But it would ^^B^^B De a veTy serious matter if its use were to be excluded as a matter of principle in ^^B^^B all circumstances. ^^BANNEX III^L-m Mr. Dulles&apos; Statement of 23rd April, 1954, to N.A.T.O. Ministers ^^B^^B Mr. Dulles said that he wished to say a few words on the thinking of the United ^^BB^B States Government about the use of atomic weapons and restrictions on their use. ^^B^^B These restrictions and limitations derived from circumstances local, moral, ^^B^^B political, &amp;c.  They certainly existed, but it was of great importance that a ^^BB^B potential enemy should not be aware of the exact character of these limitations. ^^B^^B Otherwise he would be able to adjust his measures of defence accordingly and ^^B^^B concentrate more fully on offence.  This might sound somewhat extreme, but ^^B^^B   I actual United States conduct would probably not be so forbidding. ^^B
mmm mmmOur object was to deter the aggressor and prevent the outbreak of war. Inthis nuclear weapons must play a very large part.  The danger we were facing ^-M^-^k              was the concentrated military power of the Soviets.  This constituted a vast threatbased on the central Soviet land mass and which could be directed at will at anypoint all round the periphery.  Attacks of this nature could never be deterred if ^L^L\the counter-measures were only to be applied at the place and by the means which ^-Mthe enemy chose.  On this basis he would always win because he could choose the ^L^LmfJJJJJ              place and the weapons which gave him the greatest local superiority. ^-MThe free world was faced by the impossibility of matching non-atomic Sovietstrength.  Any attempt to do so would severely overstrain the economic, socialand fiscal systems of the free nations and would expose us all to internal subversion. ^L^LM^-^M              Moreover, we know that the Soviets themselves possess atomic weapons and mustassume that they will use them.   Not only this, they will use them in the mannermost advantageous to themselves, namely by the use of maximum surprise.   Since ^-M^-^L\              the free world must always reject the idea of preventive war, this gave a very large ^-Madvantage to the Soviets.  The advantage could only be minimised if the free ^L^L\world maintained adequate retaliatory strength.  It was United States policy to ^-^L\^^fl              maintain striking power including effective atomic striking power within its overall ^L^M^-^L\              capacity.  They must be able to retaliate instantly and as formidably as possible. ^L^L\Soviet power was restrained only by fear of this retaliation and the consequences^-^L\              which it might have for the existence of the regime.   We were faced by the fact ^L^LMthat this position would continue and must be held until such time as the futuremight bring the possibility of creating mutual safeguards.It had been recognised by N.A.T.O. that its current conventional forces wereinsufficient for the tasks in this area and that reliance must now be placed on new ^L^LMweapons.  This presupposed the willingness of N.A.T.O. to use atomic weaponsiJJJJJ              and this in turn meant that they and the means to use them must be available in fJJJJJ^-^L\              substantial quantities.   In other words our military capabilities must be soorganised as to produce the greatest retaliatory threat and we must be ready totreat atomic weapons as conventional weapons.^-^L\                    The United States intended to co-operate fully with its Allies in all this. ^-^L\Consultation was an essential element in our common purpose, but in the last resortit must not stand in the way of effective retaliation.  The United States would seek^L^LM              ways to consult its Allies as far as feasible in the event of any new aggression, but ^L^Mit might be that retaliation would have to be instant to be effective. ^L^LMfJJJJJ                    If we were to renounce the use of the new weapons we should abandon the      I fJJJJJprinciples which have saved freedom from despotism throughout history. Weshould at once accept a position of military inferiority and this has always been^-^L\              an invitation to war.  If we were to announce that it was our policy not to use ^-^LX^L^m              atomic weapons, this would be a direct temptation to the Soviets to resort to war.^L^Lm              The United States and its Allies must be free to use atomic weapons whenever and^-M wherever this would be of advantage. In considering this many factors would have ^-^L\^-M              to be taken into account beyond the purely military.  But provided we did not tieour hands in advance we could hold over an aggressor the threat of using atomic ^-^m^-W              weapons where they would hurt most, so that for the first time in history it would   I ^-^L\^-M              be clear in advance that an aggressor would only lose by his aggression.  It must fJJJJJ^-m also be clear that he could not hope to gain by local aggression, but this did not ^-^L\^-M              mean that every local war would become a general war nor that if atomic weaponswere used locally they would be used indiscriminately.^-M The Soviets must realise that we would use if necessary our full powers to^-9              deter aggression.  The will to use our strength was as important as the strength ^mm^-M              itself and until nuclear weapons could be brought under international control this ^-m?JJJJ              was our only safeguard.  The President&apos;s plan aimed at producing a new ^-m^Lm              atmosphere, however, and they were prepared to explore any measures in this ^-U^-W              direction, provided only this did not increase the danger to the free world.
