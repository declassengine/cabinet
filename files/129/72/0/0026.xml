... , &amp; /ll(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)SECRET//C(54) 3 76 COPY NO. 606th December, 1954CABINETEAST/WEST TRADE - ROLLING MILLSMemorandum by the Minister of SupplyWe have enquiries from the Soviet bloc for tinplate mills,strip and sheet mills for steel, stainless steel, aluminium and non-ferrous metals, foil mills and continuous billet and bar mills worth altogetherapproximately  30,000,000.2. Of these the United States Government want us to embargoall the strip and sheet mills and the bar mill, amounting to  26,000,000of the total.3. I suggest that we should agree to embargo only seamless tubemills and wide continuous strip mills in addition to our previous proposals.We could at a later stage depending on the course of negotiations offer toembargo continuous bar and rod mills and reversing wide strip mills.4. The effect of this would be thats-(a)  We should be willing to sell the tinplate mills,the medium and narrow mills for steel and non-ferrous metals, the foil mills and the continuous billet mills, amounting to 22,000,000, because we believe them to bebasic industrial equipment with no specialmilitary significance.(b) We should refuse to sell the aluminium and stainlesssteel sheet mills, amounting to  5,500,000,because they are of direct importance to militaryproduction.(c) We should be prepared to refuse to sell the continuousbar mill and a reversing wide strip mill, amountingto  2,750,000.    This concession could not bejustified by the direct military importance of the equipment, but might be a useful bargaining counter.5. An embargo definition to give effect to this is attached.6. This compromise on rolling mills put to the Americans by itself would not, I am sure, be acceptable to them in view of their recentinsistence on withholding from the bloc heavy machinery which will make
a contribution to its basic industrial strength.   But it may be that theywill accept if it is accompanied by the concessions proposed by thePresident of the Board of Trade.S.JL.Ministry of Supply, W.C.2.4th December, 1954.DEFINITIONMetal rolling mills as follows:-(a)  seamless tube mills, and cold tube reducingand expanding mills; (h) continuous bar mills, other than those ^designed for rails or structurals; (c)  continuous rod mills;   /(d)  plate, strip, sheet and foil mills, as follows:-(i)  plate mills having a roll face width of48&quot; or more;(ii)  continuous / or reversing /4-high stripmills having a roll face width of 48&quot;or more;(iii) having work rolls rotating in a planetaryform around the back-up rolls;(iv)  having the work rolls supported by multipleback-up rolls or bearings;(v) having work rolls of 3&quot; diameter or less;(vi) having driven back-up rolls.The words in brackets refer to types of mills which should not beincluded in the initial proposals but might be added later if necessary.
