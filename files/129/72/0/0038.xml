secret.(54) 38814th December, 1954COPY NO.  -CABINETINDEPENDENT TELEVISION AUTHORITYMemorandum by the Postmaster-general  think my colleagues should know that Sir Charles Colston hassent me a letter resigning from the Independent Television Authority ofwhich he was Deputy Chairman.    I attach a copy of his letter and of myreply.    As will be seen, he is resigning without any outward sign of disagreement.2.        I should perhaps mention, however, that, although he does not say so, he has had serious differences with the Chairman and othermembers of the I.T.A., especially on the matters dealt with inC.(54) 369.3.        I had hoped that it would be possible to announce his resignationand the appointment of a successor at the same time.    For fear ofleakage, however, I think that his resignation must now be made public and, with his agreement, I am sending copies of the correspondence tothe Press.D.General Post Office, E. C.l.14th December, 1954.A. 13, Albany,Piccadilly, W.l.9th December, 1954.My dear Postmaster-General,You will remember when you first asked me to become a memberof the Independent Television Authority, I told you that personal reasonsmight arise which would compel me to resign at short notice.    In spiteof this you said you were willing to run the risk, and you would like meto serve if only for a short period.    This I agreed to do, and I amhonoured that you should have appointed me.Circumstances have arisen which necessitate my taking actionmuch earlier than I expected.    It is with great regret that for personalreasons I now have to tender you my resignation from the independent television Authority.
In the short time that the Authority has been in existencean immense amount has been achieved, and I look forward with confidence to Commercial Television becoming a great success.    That it should doso is my earnest wish.It has been a great privilege to serve on the Authority, andin saying good-bye to my colleagues, I want to wish them every possiblesuccess.Yours sincerely,(Signed)    CHARLES COLSTONThe Rt. Hon. the Earl De La Warr,Postmaster General.10th December, 1954.My dear Colston,It is a great blow to us all that you now find it necessary to resign from the Independent Television Authority.    I must admit that when you took on this work you did warn me that you might ask to be released at short notice, but I had hoped that you would be able to carry on ratherlonger than you now find possible.While you have been with the Authority a great step forward hasbeen taken, and you yourself have done a magnificent job.    It was especiallypublic spirited of you to do all this without drawing the salary to which you were entitled.Thank you so much.Yours very sincerely,(Signed) DE LA WARRSir Charles Colston, C.B.E., M.C., D. C.M.
