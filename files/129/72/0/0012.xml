DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY  OF  HER   BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1954CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.   73C. (54) 36226th November, 1954CABINETPROPOSED INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY:PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will be aware that we are committed to support president eisenhower&apos;s initiative for an International Atomic Energy Agency. A resolutionjust approved by the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assemblynotes that negotiations for establishing an International Atomic Energy Agencyare in progress between interested countries and expresses the hope that the Agencywill be established without delay. Talks between a limited number of countries,in which the United Kingdom, United States and Canada have played a leading part, have been taking place over the last few months. The number of countries participating is now likely to be increased.2. With a view to taking the initiative in these discussions, we are proposing to put forward a draft Convention establishing the Agency as a basis for negotiation with other interested countries. This Convention will be discussed in the first place with the United States and Canadian Governments and later with other interestedStates.3. The relationship of the proposed Agency to the United Nations is notyet decided; it may take the form of a United Nations Specialised Agency or itmay have some other form of relationship with the United Nations. whatever the form, it will be necessary for its staff to enjoy diplomatic privileges and immunities. The number of persons to whom privileges and immunities wouldhave to be granted is unlikely to be large.4. In accordance with the request made by my colleagues in July 1952(C.C. (52) 62nd Conclusions, Minute 6), I am giving early notice that immunities and privileges may be required in this country for the staff of the Agency, thoughit will be some time before the Convention establishing the Agency and its headquarters will take final shape. It will be necessary eventually to lay beforeParliament the draft of an Order in Council under the International Organisations(Immunities and Privileges) Act, 1950, conferring such privileges and immunitiesas may be required by the terms of the proposed Convention.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,25th November, 1954.47215
