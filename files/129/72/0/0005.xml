THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF  HER   BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1954CONFIDENTIALC. (54) 35524th November, 1954CABINETTHE SINO-SOVIET AGREEMENTS OF 12th OCTOBER, 1954Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 12th October details were announced of a series of agreements between theSoviet Union and China. A summary of these agreements, with brief comments,is at Annex A.2. The agreements come within the framework of the Sino-Soviet Treatyof Alliance of February 1950 and the other Sino-Soviet agreements concluded at that time.   A note on the 1950 Agreement is at Annex B.3. The present agreements were negotiated by an imposing Soviet delegationled by Mr. Krushchev, First Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, and including Marshal Bulganin, Soviet Minister of Defence, and Mr. Mikoyan,Minister of Trade, which had come to Peking ostensibly to attend the5th Anniversary celebrations of the establishment of the Central People&apos;sGovernment. The fact that the Soviet delegation was headed by the First Secretaryof the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (who is not a member of the SovietGovernment) illustrates not merely the special attention which the Soviet leadersfeel bound to pay to China, but the problems posed by collective leadership andthe absence on the Soviet side of any one of comparable stature to Mao Tse-tun.In conversation with the Labour Party Delegation to China, Krushchev gave theimpression that he had been particularly impressed by the vast population and potential power of China.conclusions. (a) The agreements and the manner of their negotiation are clearacknowledgment by the Soviet leaders of China&apos;s equal position inthe Sino-Soviet partnership. They reflect the increased status whichthe Chinese leaders have achieved since Stalin&apos;s death. Moreover,increased prestige for China will add to her power to attract otherAsian States into her orbit and will appear to the world at large to augment the power and prestige of communism in general.(b) The expulsion of United States influence from Asia, particularly from japan, will continue to be the major objective of Communist policyin the Far East. The Communists will concentrate on trying to persuade the countries of the East that their best hope of avoidingtrouble lies in coming to terms with the Communists on the basis of&quot; non-aggression &quot; and &quot; co-existence.&quot; !(c) The timing of the negotiations may be partly explained by the need to revise the Soviet economic assistance programme. But this programme is not outstandingly impressive and the presence of Marshal Bulganinlends weight to the supposition that there were in fact important military discussions of which nothing has been said publicly.id) The agreements are likely to be exploited for propaganda purposes in asia and seem well suited for the purpose. Conversely they will reduce the effectiveness of attempts to depict China as a Soviet puppet.A. E.22nd November, 1954.Copy No.   ^ g47190
ANNEX ATHE 1954 agreements the eight separate declarations or agreements which were published on12th October comprise:  (i) a joint declaration on foreign policy emphasising Sino-Soviet solidarity;attacking the United States for her support of Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s forcesin Formosa and her tactics in the United Nations; calling for anotherconference on Korea; and putting forward as the basis of Sino-Sovietco-operation with the countries of Asia, the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and peaceful co-existence. These are the now familiar&quot; five principles&quot; which were embodied in the preamble to theSino-Indian Agreement on Tibet.CommentThis is in line with recent Chinese policy statements. The passage on Formosais admittedly confined to a simple affirmation that United States &quot; occupation &quot; of formosa is incompatible with the maintenance of security in the Far East. Butthere is little evidence to justify the suggestion which has been made that this represents some sort of concession to the Russians and that the latter had beenurging moderation on the Chinese. The Soviet Government has throughoutendorsed Chinese policy towards Formosa and in a speech made in Peking on30th September Mr. Krushchev strongly supported Chinese declarations on thesubject.(ii) A joint declaration sympathising with the Japanese people and offeringthe establishment of normal political and economic relations with japan.comment the declaration on Japan makes clear that the &quot; neutralization &quot; of Japan andits detachment from the United States is one of the most important objectives of communist policy in the Far East. This is, of course, not a new policy; what isnew is the vigorous manner in which it is being pursued.(iii) A joint communique on the withdrawal of Soviet forces from the naval base at Port Arthur to be completed by 3rd May, 1955.comment the presence of Marshal Bulganin in Peking may indicate that military issueswider than the hand-over of the port installations were discussed. Nevertheless,withdrawal of Russian forces from Port Arthur is an important gain for theChinese. It removes a potential cause of friction. It also makes it easier for the communists to agitate against foreign bases in Asia, and may at some future dateenable them to contrast the Soviet attitude with our continued retention of hong Kong.(iv) A joint communique on the sale of all Soviet shares in the four Sino-Soviet joint stock companies in China, the value being repaid by thesupply of normal exports over a period of years.comment the Soviet withdrawal from the Sino-Soviet joint stock companies conformswith Soviet policy in Roumania, Hungary and Bulgaria. Here too a potentialcause of friction has been removed. However, the value of the Soviet shares willbe compensated by supplying to the Soviet Union goods which are items of usualexport from China, and this may be expected to place a heavy additional burden on the Chinese economy.(v) An agreement on scientific and technical co-operation and exchange fora term of five years, to be implemented by a Soviet-Chinese commission which will be convened at least twice yearly, alternately in Moscow andPeking.
(vi) An agreement under which the Soviet Union (a) grants China a long-term credit of 520 milllion roubles (approxi-mately  47 millions) to assist in the construction of an additionalfifteen industrial enterprises in China, and(b) undertakes to increase by not more than 400 million roubles(approximately  37 millions) the supply of equipment for 141enterprises covered in earlier agreements.comment the scale of economic aid cannot stand comparison with, for example, UnitedStates assistance to Europe or our own recent investment in the Commonwealth,and is insignificant compared with China&apos;s actual needs.(vii) An agreement providing for the construction of a railway between Tsining(190 miles north-west of Peking) and Ulan Bator (the capital of OuterMongolia), to be completed by 1955 and to be joined with the linerunning north from Ulan Bator to the Trans-Siberian Railway in theU.S.S.R.(viii) An agreement on the construction of a railway connecting Lanchow (inKansu province of Western China), Urumchi (in Sinkiang) and AlmaAta, the capital of Kazakh S.S.R. on the Turkmen-Siberian Railway.comment the proposed railways are important, both commercially and strategically,though they are unlikely to be completed for some years. They will reduce the strain on the now overloaded Trans-Siberian Railway and shorten the journeybetween Peking and Moscow by several days. They will aid the economic develop-ment of both Mongolia and Sinkiang. Since the terrain is in both cases moredifficult on the Chinese side, the Chinese have probably derived the greatercomparative advantage.ANNEX BTHE 1950 agreements the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Aid was signed by Mr. Chou En-lai and M. Vyshinsky in Moscow on 14th February, 1950.In the preamble it is stated that the Treaty is designed to prevent the resumption of aggression on the part of Japan &quot; or any other State that maycollaborate with Japan directly or indirectly in acts of aggression.&quot; Article 1provides that &quot; in the event of one of the Contracting Parties being attacked by japan or any State allied with her and thus being involved in a state of war, theother Contracting Party shall immediately render military and other assistance byall means at its disposal.&quot;At the same time the Soviet Union granted to China a $300 million credit,and agreed to hand over Port Arthur, Dairen and the Chinese Changchun Railwaynot later than the end of 1952. On 15th September, 1952, a joint communiquewas issued agreeing to the transfer of the Changchun Railway not later than31st December, 1952, but &quot;at the request of the Chinese Government&quot; thetime limit for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the joint naval base of PortArthur was extended until the conclusion of peace treaties between Japan and theSoviet Union and China.
