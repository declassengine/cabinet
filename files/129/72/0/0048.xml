\(o1(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(54) 398 COPY NO.18th December, 1954CABINETINDEPENDENT TELEVISION AUTHORITY;PROGRAMME CONTRACTORSMemorandum by the Postmaster GeneralSince I circulated C. (54) 369 on 30th November the independent television Authority (I.T.A.) has had further correspondence with the associated Broadcasting Development Company (A0B.D0C.).    The latestdevelopment is a letter from A.B.D.C. objecting to the refusal of theI.T.A. to accept the News of the World or the Daily Express as partnersor shareholders in the Company in the present stage of development ofcommercial television.    Copies of this letter and of the reply sent bythe IcT0A, are annexed.2.      In an earlier letter, dated 10th December, ^he I.T.A. had refusedto accept these newspapers (ox- indeed any other national Conservativenewspaper) at this stage of the scheme as part of A.B0D0C,, but didagree to participation of provincial newspapers on the following basis.AoBoD8C0 finance would be provided by Birmingham interests, Londoninterests, and the Littler Group in approximately equal parts; the birmingham interests might include both the Uiffe Press and the westminster Press, each of them having about 7j per cent of the totalA.B.D.C. shareholding (i. e. about half the Birmingham part),,3.      On 17th December the I.TA. again refused to accept any nationalConservative newspaper as part of the A.B.D.C. and said that the tripartite arrangement already proposed was the farthest it could go,4.      The A.B.D.C. has also asked what power the I.T.A. has under the television Act to exclude the News of the World and the Daily Express.It has been told that the &quot;appointment of programme contractors is amatter for the I.T.A. to decide and in making its decision it must, ofcourse, take into account the constitution of prospective programme con-tractors and other circumstances relative to the appointment&quot;.5,      If the A.B.D.C. should insist on including right wing nationalnewspapers, the LToA. will either have to yield or reject the company asa prospective programme contractor and find an alternative.    In both cases there could be acute public controversy.    Although the I.T.A. hasresponsibility under the Act for these appointments it feels that thedecision with which it is faced is largely a political one, and it wants toknow that it has the support of the Government on the line it is taking.Although I myself am inclined to agree, I feel it right to inform and con-suit my colleagues on this point.D.General Post Office, E.C.1.18th December, 1954.
ANNEXAssociated Broadcasting Development Co. Ltd. ,25, Catherine Street,Aldwych, W.C.2.14th December, 1954.Dear Kenneth,Thank you for your letter oJ December 10th.Let me say at once how delighted I and my colleagues are that the Authority re-affirm its eagerness to have A.B.D.C. appointed as a Programme Contractor.What worries me about your letter is how we can in allfairness rule out  &quot;participation by the News of the World, and possibly also by the Daily Express&quot;.    As you know, the only undertaking we havegiven is that we would have a minimum of ten or a dozen shareholders,none of whom would have a controlling interest.    Obviously, if the news of the World, or the Daily Express were to come in, they would be governed by the above undertaking and would not have a controlling interest.If you now wish me to exclude either or both these papers asminority shareholders of our company, will you please give me guidance as to the section of the Act under which you ask us to exclude them?As you will appreciate, I must now give these newspapers some adequate and sufficient reason for having to break off the conversations which wehave had, and the newspapers may well see fit to publish anything thatI say.    For this reason I am turning to you before I make any kind of statement.For my part, I feel that I. have to the full kept my promise to the deputy Chairman when he spoke to me from the Postmaster General&apos;room.    As you know, I undertook to approach Messrs, Odhams and the news Chronicle before coming to any final arrangement with anothernational newspaper or newspapers.    There was at that time never any suggestion that if Messrs. Odhams and the News Chroncile should decline to come in, no other national newspaper would be allowed in either.Indeed the implication was that we had to receive either a &quot;yea&quot; or a &quot;nay&quot;the important point being that we had made the offer - from Messrs.Odhams and the News Chronicle before we could re-open talks with the news of the World and the Daily Express.It thus comes as a surprise to me that the Authority should now make the participation of Conservative newspapers entirely conditional upon participation of non-Conservative newspapers,I am anxious to help in every possible way.    With you, my main objective is the establishment of successful independent Television.
If there is any point in this letter about which you would liketo speak with me, do please let me know. I am most anxious that weshould avoid any misunderstanding.Yours,(Signed) BOB RENWICKP.S.  We shall be sending to-morrowa copy of a paper whichNorman Collins is getting outon the relations between thePress and Free Television.4, St. James&apos;s Square,s.w.1.1.17th December, 1954,Thank you for your letter of the 14th.    I am grateful for the reasonable and kindly way in which you write, but am sorry to see thatI have not yet succeeded in clearing up the misunderstandings between us.    May I put our position in a slightly different way?The Authority, subject to contract, offered the appointmentof your company as a programme contractor on the basis of your statement that it would be made up of members drawn from existing companies orinterests associated with your present Board, and from other interestsincluding one or more newspapers.    The only newspapers or newspaperorganisations you said you were in contact with during the whole time that the application was being considered was Odhams Press, the news Chronicle and the Daily Mirror.    Having in mind the work which you and your associates had already done in the field of television, theAuthority did not tie you to the exact fulfilment of this plan, but of course this proposition was based on the final formation of an operating companyalong these lines.You are now proposing a very different kind of company.Certain newspapers which at an early stage you gave the Authority every reason to believe would join you, have not done so, and other newspapershave come upon the scene.    Neither the News of the World nor the daily Express were mentioned at all in your application, nor even orally.Before the proposition in regard to week-days in Birmingham and theLondon/week-end was first made to you, no mention was made of anyconversations going on or proposed with either the News of the Worldor the Daily Express.You must see that to introduce these two national Conservativenewspapers alters the character of your original proposal.    If papers ofsuch standing as the Daily Express or the News of the World had wishedto take some part in the first stage of the scheme, either they could have
applied direct to us, or they should have entered into firm negotiationswith you prior to your application- in which case you would have informed us of it.    But, quite apart from these general considerations, the fact is that had the participation of the News of the &quot;World been made acondition of your application for a contract, we should not have made you the offer we did on November 2nd.It is true that the inclusion of the Littler group and the twoBirmingham newspaper groups also varies your first proposal; butwe are prepared to accept it, partly because both Littler and the birmingham Mail were among the original applicants for contracts.That is the limit to which we can go.The Authority has no objection in principle to any particularnewspaper, but having regard to the balance of the scheme in its first stage, feels that it would be contrary to the public interest, and above all contrary to the maintenance of public confidence in the scheme, tohave any further representation of the Conservative national press atthis stage.    This bears on the question in your third paragraph.    Theappointment of programme contractors is a matter for the independent television Authority to decide, and in making its decision it must, ofcourse, take into account the constitution of prospective programme contractors and other circumstances relative to the appointment.(Signed)  KENNETH CLARKSir Robert Renwick, 3t. , K.B.E140, Park Lane, W. 1.
