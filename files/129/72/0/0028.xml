secret(54) 378 COPY NO.  6^3rd December, 1954CABINETRETIRED PAY OF PUBLIC SERVANTSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the imminence of improved National Insurance and WarDisability pensions is causing considerable pressure for better &quot;pensions increase&quot; arrangements - that is, the arrangements for supplementing thepensions of public service pensioners, to offset in some degree the effects of severe increases in the cost of living.     (Annex 1 gives a briefdescription of the arrangements since 1939).Enquiries and representations are being received from and onbehalf of pensioners of all sorts: for example, from the Staff Side of theCivil Service National Whitley Council, and from the National Union of teachers.    In particular, the Officers Pension Society are campaigning onbehalf of retired Service officers, and doing so in much the same terms asthey used during their &quot;9f per cent cut&quot; campaign a few months ago,modified only as made necessary by the restoration of the &quot;9j per cent cut&quot;.2. My colleagues will remember the discussions which precededthe decision in February to restore the 9jr per cent cut for civil servantsas well as for retired officers (C.C,(54) 12th Conclusions, Minute 4).    Itwill be remembered that we put together a comprehensive White Paper onthe &quot;Retired Pay and Pensions of former forces Officers and CivilServants affected by Stabilisation and Consolidation in 1932 - 1935&quot;(Cmd. 9092),    In this White Paper we went to great pains to set out not onlythe chain of events leading to the 1935 stabilisation but also (and this from our present point of view is more important) the principles underlyingpensions increase and the Governments conviction that in general (thatis, apart from the scope then left for restoration of the 9j; per cent cut) thepensions increase measures of 1952 had done all that was called for insupplementing pensions in the light of the further rise in the cost of livingsince 1947 - the date of the previous measures.3. In paragraphs 44-45 of the White Paper we summarised theprinciples, and the then practical situation in the light of those principles,as follows:-&quot;44.    The fundamental principles of public service pensions, that once awarded they are not normallysubject to change in either direction, has been upheldby successive Governments.    It has also been endorsed by Parliament.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government are in no way prepared to abandon it.    In their view it is a principle that should be departed from (as it has been)only to the extent that severe falls in money valuescausing real hardship among pensioners may justify
special increases - as distinct from revisedpensions - where the degree of hardship calls for it.    Thus as recently as 19-52 the last Pensions(Increase) Act was passed for public service pensioners and similar provision made for retired officers.There has since been no change in the circumstances to justify further exceptional action of this sort.45.     Thus in the Governments view there can onthe one hand be no return to the exceptionalarrangements prevailing in the 20&apos;s and 30&apos;s forretired Forces&apos; Officers and Civil Servants; noron the other is there any sufficient case for furthergeneral improvements in pensions for public service pensioners&quot;.4. Since the issue of the White Paper the cost of living as measured by the Retail Price Index has moved from 141 to 144.    this small increase of less than Z\ per cent affords no ground for furthersupplementation of public service pensions.    Nor can a sufficient case be built on the rise of under 4-f per cent which has occurred since the1952 Act was passed;   &quot;real hardship&quot; in this connection has always beenheld to arise only from much bigger cost^of-living changes.5. Indeed, present pressures are mainly the result of thelimelight now being thrown on &quot;national&quot; pensions.    The question thenis:- Does the fact that we are improving national retirement pensionsand war disability pensions constitute a^change in circumstances whichjustifies further exceptional action vis-a^vis public service pensioners?6. I would suggest to my colleagues that the answer to thisquestion must be &quot;No&quot;.-Public service pensions, being occupational pensions, arefundamentally different in their nature from national retirement and wardisability pensions.    They are not subsistence pensions: being based onlength of service and rank or pay on retirement, they may be &quot;more or theymay be less.    I am sure that we shall be letting ourselves and oursuccessors in for serious trouble if we seem to accept the principle that circumstances which justify changes in national pensions necessarily justifychanges in public service pensions.    We have, above all, to remember that public service x^ensioners are not the only people living on fixed incomes;that in so far as public service pensioners already receive a pensions increase they are to that extent singled out from many others affected by thefall in the value of money;  and that still further to help public service pensioners would need more justification than there is at present,7. We shall, of course, have to be prepared to face considerable pressure.    We shall be told that the 1952 measures may have been asmuch as public service pensioners could expect from a national economy which could only afford 32/6d. as the basic National Insurance rate, but are inadequate by the more generous standards of to-day.    We cannot say thatthey will share with others the improvement in National Insurance, becauseso many of them were exempted from the Old Age Pensions Scheme andare, therefore, excluded from the benefit now.
The Officers&apos; Pension Society will no doubt be speciallyclamant.    Going beyond the accepted principle of relief of real hardship andpressing their own much wider claims, the Society will emphasise one pointin particular - that the retired pay of all officers who retired before 1st September, 1950, should be raised to current rates.    In support of this it will, no doubt, make play with the fact that there are a few survivingofficers retired before the 1919 Code still receiving 1914 rates, and thatas the 1919 Code provided for adjustments of 20 per cent either way, the1935 stabilisation was a breach of faith.8. I should add that, apart from the objections in principle,there would be great practical difficulties in doing anything to meet these claims.Annex 2 shows the effect of the 1952 measures on officersretired under the 1945 Code, both absolutely and by comparison with thepensions of those retired under the 1950 Code, the Code now in force.    Itwill be seen that below  500 there is no scope whatever for improvementwithout bringing the earlier pensions above the current rates, and thusforcing an immediate improvement of the present Code.    One cannot say what a revision of the current (1950) Code would cost - but it might beexpected to run into several millions a year.    This would be in additionto the cost of any further &quot;pensions increase&quot;, the cost of which would alsorise as officers eligible attained the age of 60.On the civil side, the room for improving the 1952 rates for civil servants without making old pensions greater than later ones (unless we alter the limiting dates, so as to increase pensions now excluded fromthe full benefit of the 1952 Act because they were too recently awarded) isat all levels below  400 go small - ranging from nothing to  10 - as inpractice to be non-existent.    But in any event civilians and Forces must betreated alike, as they always have been,9. Therefore, though certain groups - in particular, the Officers&apos;Pension Society - are likely to stir up a great campaign, I think we shall be right to resist it, and that we must take our stand firmly on what we said in the White Paper.10. I recommend, therefore, that the representations departments are receiving should be answered in the negative, and by reference to theWhite Paper.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.3rd December, 1954.
ANNEX 1ARRANGEMENTS SINCE 1939The present arrangements for pensions increase are largelygoverned by the Acts of 1944 and 1947 ( in effect one scheme) and the act of 1952.The main general features of the arrangements are asfollows: -(a) There is an income limit beyond which no increases canbe given, i. e., a pension of  50 a year is not increased if the man has, say,a wife with an income of  1,000 a year.(b) The income limits, and in most cases the rate of increase, are higher for pensioners with dependants than for those without.(c) Increase is not payable to pensioners (except ill-healthpensioners) who are under1 60 years of age.(d) Subject to special arrangements necessary because somepensions reflect pay received over a period of years, increase is paid onlyto pensioners who retired before the passing of the Acts.    Pensionersentitled to benefit under the 1944 -47 scheme also receive increases underthe 1952 scheme.Very briefly the chief features of the two main schemes areas follows:The 1944-1947 scheme is directed towards the rise in thecost of living between 1939 and 1947;  the limiting date for full increase is the date (which varied from service to service) at which new pensionsbegan to rise above pre-war levels; the income limit is  450 (or  502with the &quot;disregarded&quot; other income).    The increases payable range from40 per cent of pension on pensions under  100, up to  60 on higher pensions.The 1952 scheme is directed towards the rise in the cost ofliving between 1947 and 1952;  the limiting date for the full increase is31st March, 1948;  the income limit is  550 (or  654, taking account of&quot;disregarded&quot; other income), and the increase payable is a flat rate of  26,or  33&quot;S&apos;    per cent on pensions less than  78.
