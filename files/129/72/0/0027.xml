(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(54) 377 COPY NO.4th December, 1954CABINETBRITISH EUROPEAN AIRWAYS:RENFREW MAINTENANCE BASEMemorandum by the President of the Board of Tradeand the Mlinister of supply on 24th November, we were invited to report on the prospects of finding an alternative tenant for the Renfrew premises, who could providealternative employment for the men who would be displaced from their employment if the British European Airways (3.E.A.) moved their maintenancebase to London (C.C.(54) 7Cth Conclusions, Minute 2).2.        To take advantage of the skill available and the facilities ofRenfrew, such a tenant should preferably be in the aircraft industry.    Newproductive capacity is not needed and, if it were, it would take too long toset up.    The efforts made in recent months by the Ministry of Supply tointroduce a suitable tenant to the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviationhave therefore been concentrated on firms engaged in aircraft repair work.     There now appears to be good prospect that these efforts couldbe brought to fruition.    air work Ltd. believe that a contract couldshortly be signed by them with Canadair Ltd. for the repair of royal canadian Air Force Sabre aircraft.    This work would absorb some 300of the men who would be made redundant by the proposed B.E.A. move;this labour force would be required in the spring and for at least aconsiderable time thereafter.3.        In addition, the Ministry of Supply expect to invite tendersnext summer for the overhaul of some 320 Royal Air Force Sabre air craftwhich are to be exchanged with the Americans for Hunters.    The work would start in August and last until September, 1956.    If air work secureall or part of this work, it is understood to be their wish to do it atRenfrew, for which they would require additional labour to that mentionedabove for about twelve months from the late summer of 1955,4.        No alternative tenant for Renfrew can at the moment be suggestedfrom among the aircraft industry.5.        The Regional Controllers of the Board of Trade were asked aslong ago as the end of May to keep the possibilities of Renfrew in mindwhen dealing with industrialists considering expansion, but have nocandidate in view at present.    The premises cannot be canvassed at allwidely until it is publicly known that they will be vacated (and roughlywhen this will happen) and interested concerns can be shown over them.
I think it right to warn my colleagues however that, in the event of its notbeing possible to find a tenant from the aircraft industry, they must notassume that it would be easy to find an industrial tenant.    The premisesconsist of a number of buildings, all of a highly specialised character and almost entirely of standard hangar construction, with a height of37-50 ft.    They would be very expensive to heat and are unlikely to beattractive to ordinary manufacturing industry.P.T.S.L.3rd December, 1954.
