THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY  OF  HER  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1954SECRETC. (54) 35322nd November, 1954CABINETUNITED NATIONS KOREAN RECONSTRUCTION AGENCYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsProblemThe United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency (U.N.K.R.A.) is in serious financial straits. When the General Assembly established an agency to restore the war-shattered economy of Korea in 1950 it authorised a programmeof $266 millions. Not more than $122-3 millions has been received from member nations. This has nearly all been spent and unless more is forthcoming very soonU.N.K.R.A. will have to close down. The only countries that have contributedat all substantially have been the U.S.A. ($84-3 millions), the United Kingdom($22-5 millions), Canada ($6 9 millions) and Australia ($2-5 millions). All theother countries between them have only raised $6-1 millions.2. It is most unlikely that it will be possible to obtain any very large amounts of new money for U.N.K.R.A. But if the Agency has to close down now withoutany further contributions it will leave a number of projects unfinished, there maybe some dislocation of the already shaky Korean economy, the United Nations&apos;effort will look very feeble by contrast with the Communist claims of reconstruction in North Korea and an excellent opening will be given to Communist propaganda.A determined effort must therefore be made to raise enough (say $20 millions) toenable U.N.K.R.A. to finish its work in an orderly way. It is our hope that anumber of nations may be prepared to contribute if a decision is taken that thisis the last time they will be asked to do so. But in order to induce them to do so the principal contributors, namely the United Kingdom, the U.S.A., Canada and australia will have to make generous contributions to prime the pump. It istherefore necessary to decide the amount to be paid by the United Kingdom inthis connection.The United States Position3. Mr. Dulles, in a personal message to me, has offered that the United StatesGovernment, whose contribution is limited by Congress to 65 per cent, of the totalsubscribed, will be prepared to override this limitation and pay $8-6 millions(which is the entire balance of the United States appropriation for U.N.K.R.A.for the current financial year) provided that the United Kingdom will pay$4-3 millions, Australia $1-16 millions and Canada $500,000.4. The United States Government is, of course, doing a great deal through its bilateral aid programme to assist the reconstruction of the Korean economy.In fact this programme is much more important than the U.N.K.R.A. programme and the United States are contributing through U.N.K.R.A. and directly, well over90 per cent, of the total aid that Korea is receiving. This bilateral aid, however,is provided in the direct United States interest and is not strictly relevant to theproblem of contributions to U.N.K.R.A.47183Copy No.    ^
The United Kingdom position. We originally undertook to contribute $28 millions ( 10 millions) to thetotal $266 millions programme [i.e., 10Jf per cent.). Others have tended to regard this $28 millions as a commitment irrespective of the actual size of the programme,but our pledge was specifically related to the total of $266 millions and we areriot in fact bound to implement it in full if that figure is not reached. We have not felt able, however, to restrict our contribution strictly to the ratio of 10^ per cent.,and we have in fact already paid $22-5 millions ( 8-1 millions) i.e., 18-4 per cent,of the total subscribed. When discussions opened on the present problem we feltthat, desirable as it was that U.N.K.R.A. should not end in failure, the presentposition in which it limped on from year to year with inadequate support, withthe danger of increased pressure on the United Kingdom to contribute even morethan our ultimate limit of $28 millions, should not be allowed to continue. It isin the interest of U.N.K.R.A. itself and of the United Nations&apos; prestige, as wellas in the United Kingdom interest, that a final decision should be taken now, andthat a final appeal for funds should be made in order that U.N.K.R.A. should beable to plan a decorous end to its operations on the basis of a definite total figure.To secure this it seemed that a generous gesture was justified and we thereforeoffered to pay up to the limit of $28 millions towards a much smaller total programme, on the basis of 174 per cent, of the total (i.e., half of all subscribedoutside the United States contribution). We were further prepared to put up$2^- millions immediately to match the American offer of $8 - 6 millions without waiting to see whether any other countries were going to subscribe. The UnitedStates Government did not accept this, hence Mr. Dulles&apos; latest approach.The Australian and Canadian Position6. The Canadians fulfilled their whole original pledge to U.N.K.R.A. sometime ago. The amount suggested for them now would be above their originalundertaking. The amount suggested for Australia would complete the Australianpledge.Possible Courses of Action7. I would like to meet Mr. Dulles as far as possible. U.N.K.R.A. has done a good job in Korea and there is little doubt that if it were to come to an untidyend now there would be adverse political consequences. Moreover, if we were seen to be hanging back on our pledges, much of the blame would, however unjustly,be put on our shoulders. The alternative courses we can adopt are:  (a) To renew our existing offer to pay 17A, per cent, of the total subscribed toU.N.K.R.A. within the limit of our $28 millions original undertaking.We might, however, raise the amount of what we put up at once to$2-8 millions ( 1 million) which is the balance of the appropriation forU.N.K.R.A. now in the Foreign Office Vote. This offer would be not unreasonable since it would still mean that we had exceeded our17^ per cent, by more than the Americans were exceeding their65 per cent., but it seems doubtful whether it would satisfy the UnitedStates Government and so induce them to pay the $8 - 6 millions whichthey have offered. It is also doubtful whether the Australians andCanadians would in such circumstances make any further contribution.(b) To accept Mr. Dulles&apos; proposal, the essence of which is that we should pay half of what the Americans now offer, but to stipulate that we willnot pay any more and that our offer of \1\ per cent, no longer stands.This alternative seems most likely to secure further contributions fromother Governments at smallest cost to ourselves.(c) To offer a figure between $2 - 8 millions and $4 - 3 millions; but there doesnot seem to be much advantage in this for we should simply become involved in bargaining.(d) To offer to pay over forthwith the whole of the balance of $5 - 46 millions which remains unpaid of the original United Kingdom pledge of $28millions. By following this course we should have made a contributionto U.N.K.R.A., which everyone must agree to be very generous andhaving made it would have a legitimate reason for refusing to pay anymore. So long as it remains unpaid in full we may be pressed to make further contributions.
Recomendations8. It is recommended that the alternatives (c) and (d) above should bediscarded, and we should attempt to secure American acceptance of (a); under this we would pay $2-8 millions at once and undertake to increase our total contribution, in the light of offers from other countries, up to $28 millions on the17^ per cent, basis although it is very unlikely that the total would in fact reach the point at which the whole of our $28 millions was called for.9. If, as seems likely, this offer is unacceptable to the Americans we should agree to pay $4-3 millions on the understanding that this would be the limit ofour contribution and that in no circumstances would we pay any more.10. Both these offers would be conditional on the present appeal being afinal one to provide U.N.K.R.A. with a definite total on the basis of which its operations would be wound up in an orderly manner.A.
