(54) 3899th December, 1954FALL-OUTMemorandum by the Minister of defence i attach a note on the effects of the explosion of a thermo-nuclear bomb.Its main purpose is to describe the conditions created by fall-out the radio-activecontamination which is caused when a bomb bursts at on near ground level. Theeffects of other forms of energy released by a thermo-nuclear explosion blast andheat are outlined briefly.2. This analysis is founded on the latest scientific information we have. Itaccords with all that we have been able to find out about the effects of the experiments by the United States in the Pacific and elsewhere. It is also supportedby a similar analysis carried out by the Canadians. We would naturally like tohave consultation with the United States in order to confirm that the conclusions reached by our scientists are compatible with those to which American scientistshave come. From the varied contacts which have taken place with the Americans,we have no reasons to suppose that they would dissent on any point of substancefrom the analysis here given. But we cannot be certain of this until our formalrequest to the Department of Defence for co-operation and consultation in this field has been submitted to Congress for approval as required by the 1954 atomic energy Act. I understand that the United States Administration hope to lay theproposed Agreement before Congress in January. In such event the consequentconstitutional processes should he completed in time to permit of joint consultationwith us early next spring.3. This means that the United States Authorities will continue to be debarred from entering into the discussions, which they as well as we agree are necessary,until after the defence estimates are presented to Parliament for 1955-56.Regrettable as this is, we should, I think, consider whether there are not certain aspects on which an approach should be made in the meantime. We need, forexample, to discuss with them the revised strategic concept of the Chiefs of staff and the implications which this has for Allied defence policy. Even more urgentis the need to consult with them on the political problems with which they as wellas we are faced in presenting to the public the changes which the advent of thehydrogen bomb imposes on our respective preparations for defence.4. There are indications that the United States Government are now considering the political implications of the hydrogen bomb for their home front.But we cannot be sure that they will consult us before making any public announce-ment about its impact on their defence plans, and, if they should announce theirpolicy without prior consultation with us, we must be able to show that we arenot unprepared for these problems in our new defensive policy.   Moreover, by47259Copy No.CABINET
initiating discussions with the Americans on the aspects which I have suggested,we should avoid giving the impression that the purpose of our approach is toobtain information about atomic energy, which they consider themselves unableto give us without the approval of Congress.5. Valuable though United States confirmation of our conclusions aboutfall-out would be, our scientists are confident that the margin of possible error inthe attached analysis is not wide enough to invalidate its substance. Moreover, the significance of fall-out for our defence planning would not be materially affectedeven if the consequences were later found to be somewhat less bleak than they appear now. There are no grounds, therefore, for deferring the necessaryre-orientation of our planning until we can check our own conclusions with the americans.6. It is, I think, evident that this new information must have a revolutionaryeffect over a wide range of our war plans, both military and civil. Thought isalready being given to its implications by the limited circle of Ministers and officials to whom this scientific appreciation is known. But we cannot ensure thatall our preparations will be properly adjusted to allow for this new factor withoutwidening the limit within which knowledge of the new implications has so far been confined. Unless this is arranged much of our planning is bound to get out of gear.7. If this is done, however, we must accept some risk that people may cometo know quite soon that the Government are planning on this new hypothesis.Admittedly, almost all the conclusions in the attached note could be reached bydiagnosis of material which has been published. But much of the presentindifference of the public would vanish if they found that the Government had adopted this basis for their defence plans.8.   I therefore propose that we should now consider:  (a) The extent to which it is desirable to issue guidance on the implications of fall-out to Departments concerned with defence preparations.(b) The manner in which the implications of fall-out for our defence policy should be presented to the public, bearing in mind that the facts of thissubject are in large measure already available to them and that the radical changes in Government plans require to take account of fall-out cannot long be concealed from the public once they are applied toour defence preparations.(c) The form and timing of an approach to the United States Governmenton problems raised in this paper. The emphasis on the initialdiscussions should, I suggest, be on the common political problems which are raised for the Americans as well as ourselves by thedevelopment of thermo-nuclear weapons, and on the importanceof harmonising the presentation to the public of the changes which wemust each make in our defence policy. It would also be valuable to exchange views with the Americans, initially perhaps on the Chiefs ofStaff level, on the implications of the latest developments for the strategic policy of the Western alliance.H.

ANNEXEFFECTS OF THE EXPLOSION OF A THERMONUCLEAR BOMBThe explosion of a hydrogen bomb releases energy in three forms blast,heat and nuclear radiation. Their relative importance depends on the distance ofthe bomb from the surface at the moment of explosion. Broadly speaking, theeffects of blast and heat are comparatively local in all cases, whereas those of radiation may be very widespread.2. Size of the Bomb. There is no technical limitation to the yield of thisweapon. The analysis which follows is related throughout to a 10-megatonbomb (10 M.T.). The highest yield achieved in the United States experimentsto date is 30 M.T. The area affected by a bomb of this yield would be about45 per cent, greater than in the case we are considering.3. Blast and Heat. Blast and heat are more intense from an air burst than from a ground burst. In dull weather damage from the heat wave is somewhat less extensive than in clear air. The blast and heat resulting from the explosion of a 10-M.T. bomb would cause destruction on about the following scale:  Air Burst 10 M.T. Ground Burstat 20,000 feet 10 M.T.(Radius in miles) (Radius in miles)(a) Surface devastation to ordinary brickhouses       ...      ...      ...      ...         1\ 5\(b) Devastation to facilities and tunnelsbelow ground      ...      ...      ...        Nil \ mile in radiusand depth(c) Major structural damage to  brickhouses       ...      ......      ...          9 6i(d) Surface damage by fire on ordinaryday...............      8-12 5-94. Radiation. The initial radiation occurring within a few seconds ofdetonation of a bomb, whether air burst or ground burst, is probably confinedwithin a radius of three or four miles. The area thus affected is therefore in anycase devastated by heat and blast.The residual radiation occurring as an after-effect of the explosion varies very greatly in its effects, according to the point of burst.If the bomb bursts too high for the fire ball to reach ground level, the bulkof the radio-active materials are carried into suspension in the upper atmosphere.They are then so dispersed that they have no serious local effects when theyeventually settle out.But if the bomb bursts at or near the ground,* quantities of much heavierradio-active particles are carried for a while by the winds that blow in differingdirections at different levels. The pattern of precipitation is irregular, varyingwith the speed and direction of the air currents in the area, but a high proportion ofthe fall-out occurs from very high levels where the winds are more constant indirection and speed. This tends to elongate the area of contamination in thedirection of the winds there prevailing.5. Effects of Radiation on Life. No medical means of curing or even curbingthe effects of radiation on human beings are yet known. On human beings theeffects are cumulative over a considerable period, becoming lethal when a certaindosage has been absorbed. In the Marshall Islands natives on an atoll 110 milesfrom the explosion received about one-third of the lethal dose: Americans whoremained in huts 150 miles downwind received over a tenth of the lethal dose.Both these groups were 20 miles off the main line of fall-out.Symptoms of radiation sickness may not show for some days, or even weeks.But about one-fifth of the lethal dose produces temporary sickness, with increasingdisability as absorption increases beyond this point.On animals the direct effects are similar. (In the Marshall Islands all animallife was extinguished on an atoll 110 miles from the explosion.)   Moreover, one* The effects of an explosion on or under the sea are, broadly speaking, intermediate betwthose of a ground burst and of an air burst bomb.
of the products of the explosion is radio-active strontium, which has an exceedinglylow rate of decay. If it gains access to the body, it is deposited in the bones likecalcium. Cattle which escaped other effects of radiation would become casualtiesif they ate grass, even in small quantities, which was contaminated in this way.Any milk they produced before they died would be imsafe for human consumption.Owing to the difficulty of arranging food and cover, most of the sheep and cattlein the contaminated area would be wiped out.All growing crops subjected to serious contamination would have to be destroyed, though root crops might be safe if they could be harvested quicklywithout being infected by surface contamination in the process. Similarly, cropslike beans might be safe, provided the pods could be removed withoutcontaminating the beans themselves. Further investigation of the implications for agriculture is necessary, but it is certain that it would not be safe to use landcontaminated with strontium for at least a year, and possibly for several years.Radiation does not in general affect inert matter. Consequently, foodstuffsoutside the inner lethal zone would almost certainly not be impaired, provided they were under cover and therefore not directly contaminated. It would benecessary to decontaminate the coverings to ensure the safety of people handlingthem and to prevent contamination of the contents.6. Area of Contamination. The superficial area which is contaminated willnot vary much in size, but its shape will depend on the prevailing wind structure.The fall-out from a single ground-burst 10-M.T. bomb would cover an area of5,000 to 6,000 square miles.7. Persistence. The radio-activity will decay with the lapse of time. Therate of decay is very rapid in the early stages, but flattens out thereafter and maypersist for a long time in regions of initial high contamination.8. Degree of Contamination. In general, the density of contamination willdiminish as the distance from the point of burst increases, but the shape of thecontour indicating any particular rate of contamination will depend on the prevailing wind structure.There will be an inner zone of approximately 270 square miles in area (larger than Middlesex), in which radiation will be so powerful that all life will beextinguished, whether in the open or in houses. Because of the persistence of the radio-active contamination in this inner zone, general relief measures would be virtually impossible for some weeks, and possibly months. People in speciallydeep shelters with their own supply of uncontaminated food and water would have some chance of survival, provided they were not entombed by other effects of the explosion. Even so, for at least a week it would not be safe for them to attempt to emerge and leave the area. Fires in this area would have to be left to burnthemselves out.Outside this central zone, the density of radiation will diminish progressivelywith distance from the point of burst, but the rate of diminution in any particulardirection depends on the prevailing wind. Within an area of about 3,000 miles,which with a steady 20-knot wind would be 170 miles long in the direction of thewind and over 20 miles wide in places, exposure in the open on the first day might easily be fatal. Rescue operations could commence on the outer fringes on thesecond day and thereafter proceed with gathering momentum but the greaterpart of the area would be immobilised for several days. Survival in this areadepends on cover. The efficiency of the cover depends on the weight of thescreening material. A thickness of 12 inches of earth would reduce the radiationdosage rate by a factor of about 15. Suitably screened shelter in an ordinarywell-bricked house can reduce the dosage rate by a factor as high as 20.There will be an outer area of 2,000-3,000 square miles in which there is a danger of radiation sickness if no precautions are taken. In general, it would besufficient for people to stay indoors for about 12 hours after the onset ofcontamination. As this depends on the speed of the wind, fall-out will not occuruntil 8-24 hours after the burst, and it might therefore be possible to move some people out of the main path which fall-out was expected to follow, should such astep be considered desirable.9. It will be clear from the above that, if there is more than one burst withina period of days, the wind structure might be such as to cause an overlapping ofthe contaminated areas. In such case, there might well be isolated pockets of highdensity contamination at considerable distances from the explosions.
