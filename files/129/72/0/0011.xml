\-^HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1954CONFIDENTIAL, Copy No.    gC. (54)36126th November, 1954CABINETROAD TRAFFIC BILL; PARKING METERSMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation the Legislation Committee this morning gave approval to the draft clauses ofthe Road Traffic Bill, and instructed me to refer to the Cabinet the question ofparking meters (L.C. (54) 15th Meeting, Item 1).2. The experimental use of parking meters to ease traffic congestion was recommended in the Report of the Working Party on Car Parking in the InnerArea of London, published in 1953. The Sub-Committee of the Home AffairsCommittee, which was set up on 31st July, 1953, to examine proposals for inclusion in the Road Traffic Bill, provided for parking meters in their first report HA. (53)101. On 18th December, 1953, the Home Affairs Committee took note of this paper (H.A. (53) 30th Meeting, Item 2), and on 28th July, 1954, considered afurther report, H.A. (54) 95, which referred to the earlier report and to a numberof additional proposals (H.A. (54) 20th Meeting, Item 2). Preparation of theBill was authorised by the Cabinet on 28th July (C.C. (54) 55th Conclusions,Minute 5).3. Parking meters are now common in the United States, and it is significant that cities in which they were introduced on a small scale some years ago have found it desirable substantially to extend their use.4. Legislation is required if parking meters are to be used, on however smalla scale, in this country. Their use would be in the first place on an experimentalbasis and the Bill is framed so that to begin with they would only be authorised in the Metropolitan Police district. The Bill provides for the extension of their use to other districts by Statutory Instrument if the local authority requests andthe Minister of Transport agrees.5. Though the initial use of the power to install parking meters would be on a modest scale, they are an essential part of my plans. I would not wish to leave mycolleagues under any illusion as to the seriousness of the problems of traffic congestion in London and other cities. The increase in the number of vehiclesmust for a good many years to come outpace such remedial measures by way of road works as it may be financially possible to undertake.6. The difficulty is accentuated by the practice, which has in large degreegrown up since the war, of motorists bringing their cars into central London in the morning and using the highway for all-day parking.7. Beyond a certain point prohibition of parking defeats its own ends because it places on the police, particularly in London, a burden of enforcement which is too great for them. No-waiting restrictions should therefore, in my view, be confined to the main traffic routes. The value of a system of parking meters is that,while meeting the need at a moderate charge for the motorist who wishes to parkin a side street or square for a short period, it is an inducement to the all-day parkerto garage his car. Many of them will not do so while they can use the Queen&apos;sHighway as a free parking space. One of the great values of parking meters is,therefore, to induce motorists to garage their cars, while keeping streets suitablefor parking available for the short term parker.47217
8. A further advantage is that it is proposed to put the greater part of theoperation of the parking meter system into the hands of the local authorities andso relieve the police of a good deal of the burden which falls on them at present.9. Another advantage is that the receipts from parking meters would givelocal authorities funds to assist in the provision of off-street parking spaces, either(jf rf above or below ground. I have talked with both local authorities and private interests in order to see whether they would be prepared to provide such garagefacilities. The replies which I have received to date were unanimous that withouta subsidy it is not a commercial proposition.10. Charges for street parking will help to resolve this problem in two ways.It will give local authorities funds towards the cost either of operating such garagesthemselves or of giving assistance to private individuals who do so. It will alsoencourage the motorist to use the garages and so make them a sounder commercialproposition.11. There appears to be a good deal of public expectation for some such provision in the Bill and its absence would, I think, cause surprise. As I have indicated, it is a system well known in the United States, where it is considered tohave been a success. Although I would intend to make a modest beginning withthe use of these powers, I must stress that they are an integral and essential part ofmy whole plan for dealing with traffic congestion, and that without them 1 shouldnot be able to make any real progress in dealing with this problem, for without them neither will restriction be fully enforceable nor will the provision of off-streetparking facilities proceed.J. A. B-C.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W.l.25th November, 1954.
