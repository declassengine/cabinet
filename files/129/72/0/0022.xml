73SE CIVETC.(54) 372 COPY NO.1st December, 1954CABINET&quot;HORROR COMICS&quot;Memorandum by the Attorney-general  doubt whether the proposals in C. (54) 359 for legislation onthis subject are desirable in their present form or likely to be effective.2.        The scope of the proposed legislation (even within the limitssuggested) is very wide, it may be wide enough to cover a generouslyillustrated edition of the Ingoldsby Legends or of some of Grimm&apos;s FairyTales.    A Bench might hold they would have a frightening effect on a child or young person.3.        The proposal that no prosecution should be undertaken in Englandor Wales except with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions,means that he will be a censor of such publications.    It is I think most undesirable that he should be placed in such a position.    If a censorshipis to be established, it should be in some other way.4.        The police are to be given power on obtaining a justice&apos;s warrantto enter and search premises when they believe publications to which theproposed Bill applies are being kept.     The Director then lias 28 days inwhich to decide whether to institute a prosecution.    This would mean that,in every case in which he did not prosecute, he would be implying that the justices were wrong in granting a search warrant, and the police in seizingthe publications.    Thus the Director would be placed in an invidious andnovel position.5.        The proposals suggest that the Bill will be limited to publicationsin a specified form.    I do not know how it is proposed to define this form, but it would seem difficult to justify making the criminal characterof a publication calculated to haye a frightening effect on a child dependon the form and not upon the content of the publication.6.        I am not aware of any judicial decision restricting the meaning of &quot;obscene&quot; to matters relating to sex.    In an Australian case decided in 1948, it was held that the word &quot;in its ordinary sense denotes something which is indecent or disgusting&quot;.    While the majority if not all of theprosecutions for obscene libel have been based on matter relating tosex or sexual perversion, one should not, I think, assume that matter which is not related to those subjects might not be held to be obscene.One has to prove that the matter alleged to be obscene has a tendency&quot;to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoralinfluences and into whose hands a publication of this sort might fall&quot;.1
7.        One difficulty in relation to a prosecution in respect of horrorcomics is that it is the cumulative effect of such publications which isevil.    Counsel of repute who has advised on the possibility of such a prosecution has expressed the view that no one of the publications whichhe has seen, considered alone, would have an appreciable tendency todeprave or corrupt.    (I have set out in the Annex to this paper the relevant part of his Opinion. )8.        Possibly one might go some way to achieving the desired endby making it clear beyond all doubt that &quot;obscene&quot; has a wider meaningthan that suggested and by securing that in a prosecution, regard mightbe had to other issues of the same publication in order to establish the tendency to deprave and corrupt.RJ3.M-B.Law Officers&apos; Department, W.C.2.1st December, 1954.annex extract from Counsels Opinion&quot;I suspect that the real evil of this class of story and the way inwhich it is told in illustrated form in these publications lies in the falsepicture which is engendered in the minds of children and young peopleof the way in which the grown up world thinks and behaves.    Thecharacters are ordinary human beings with ordinary faces and clothedin ordinary clothing.    These visually normal people are represented as being selfish, violent and filled with greed and hate.    Husbands andwives are continually shown as unfaithful;  parents as hating their children and vice versa.    Almost as a matter of course and withoutthere being anything unusual about it, many of them are in possessionof guns and all are prepared to relieve themselves of their immediatetroubles by the simple expedient of murder.&quot;The continued portrayal of this way of thought and conductmay well influence the child to think that it is natural and that there is little or nothing wrong in it.    But if this be the effect it is anunconscious rather than - as in the more usual cases of pornographicmatter - a conscious effect.    It is, moreover, an effect which results from the regular reading of this kind of stuff.    And therein lies the answer to the question upon which I am asked to advise because inany prosecution for obscene libel, each separate publication mustbe separately considered. &quot;
