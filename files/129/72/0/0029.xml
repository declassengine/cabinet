secret.(54) 379COPY NO,6th December, 1954CABINETC OL ON IA L IMMIGRAN T SMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesIt is virtually certain that this Government or its successorwill be driven by events and by the pressure of public opinion to enactlegislation controlling the immigration into this country of British subjects from overseas.     Our problem is how to balance against each other onthe one hand the need to take action as soon as possible, before the problemof coloured immigration into this country has gone much further and leads to social and industrial problems damaging to this country and to ourrelations with coloured peoples overseas, and on the other the need tocarry responsible parliamentary and public opinion with us to the greatest possible extent both in what we do and in the way we do it.2. My initial feeling was that the appointment of a DepartmentalCommittee, as proposed by the Home Secretary in C. (54) 354 was simplypostponing the issue, and that we had already, in the shape of variousofficial reports, quite enough material to enable us to take a decision now.However, bearing in mind the fact that it would probably be impossible tofind Parliamentary time for legislation on this subject during the forth-coming Session, an announcement of the Governments intention to legislate might simply serve as an invitation to potential immigrants torush to this country while the going was good, and provide far too long an interval for public debate and exacerbation.    Moreover, although thereare many signs that responsible public opinion is moving in the directionof favouring immigration control, there is still to my mind a good deal tobe done before it is solidly in favour of it.    I believe therefore that theappointment of a Committee as proposed by the Home Secretary would havethe double advantage of enabling us to postpone an announcement of our policy until nearer the time when the necessary legislation could be put inhand, and of enabling public opinion to develop further and be crystallised.3. On the assumption therefore that a Committee will be set up,I do not think it necessary here and now to enter into arguments on thepoint whether control legislation should apply to all overseas Britishsubjects or to overseas citizens of the United Kingdom and the Colonies(i, e. predominantly coloured persons only) although I may say here and now that for reasons which I would develop at the appropriate time I wouldhave the gravest misgivings about the latter proposition.    For present purposes, however, I am quite clear that, without prejudice to whatever decision may later be reached at the appropriate time, we shouldstrenuously avoid doing or saying anything now which could be interpreted as favouring racially discriminatory action.    That means to my mind thatthe terms of reference of the proposed Committee should avoid languagewhich could be interpreted as an invitation to consider discriminatory
proposals.    I fear that the use of the words &quot;any class of&quot; before&quot;British subjects&quot; in the third and fourth lines of the terms of referenceproposed in paragraph 7 of C. (54) 354 would certainly be interpreted inthat way both here and in the Colonies, whatever other explanation wesought to put upon them.    Indeed I do not know what other explanationcould plausibly be put forward.4. I incline also to the view that we should deal with deportationand immigration control together, that is to say remit the whole subjectto the proposed Departmental Committee and not now announce that we propose to go ahead with deportation legislation, if only because of thelapse of time between an announcement of this kind now and the time whenit could be translated into legislation.    I do not think an announcement ofthis kind would have any noticeably deterrent effect on immigration, since i do not imagine that many of the immigrants who cause us concernactually set out with the intention or expectation of behaving in such a way as might conceivably render them liable to deportation.    Indeed my Aopinion is that in the long term our troubles really arise when the \*immigrant workers make good to the extent that there is some questionof putting them in positions of responsibility over United Kingdom citizens.That I understand is a problem which has arisen in connection withimmigrant workers irrespective of colour.
