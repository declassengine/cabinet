- &apos;&apos; Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1954SECRETC. (54) 36930th November, 1954CABINETINDEPENDENT   TELEVISION  AUTHORITY:   PROGRAMMECONTRACTORSMemorandum by the Postmaster-GeneralThe Independent Television Authority (I.T.A.) is in some difficulty about thepolitical make-up of the Associated Broadcasting Development Company(A.B.D.C.), one of the four prospective programme contractors, the others being-(i) Associated-Rediffusion, Ltd. (formed from Associated Newspapers, Ltd.,and Broadcast Relay Service, Ltd.).(ii) Kemsley/Winnick Group.   These interests have not yet formed aspecialist company; but it is their intention to do so, with Lord Kemsleyas Chairman.(iii) Granada Theatres Ltd.2. The Company has been offered a position as programme contractor,subject to contract and to the following statement by the Company of its intention:  (a) no single shareholder to be allowed to dominate the Company therewould be ten separate partners, none holding more than about 10 percent, of the total shares;(b) the finance on this basis to be provided partly by firms with which theA.B.D.C. directors are associated e.g., E.M.I., Pye, &amp;c. but mainly by other sources including, as they hoped, Odhams Press, the NewsChronicle, the Daily Mirror. (No other newspapers of any kind werementioned.)3. A.B.D.C. failed to obtain support from some of the Companies in 2 (b)above, including all the newspapers mentioned, and without telling the I.T.A. went into negotiation with the Daily Express and the News of the World. In viewof this, the Chairman warned A.B.D.C. that he felt sure the Authority would not agree to any Right-wing newspaper joining the Company because the Right-wingpress is already sufficiently represented in the present stage of the scheme, and because the contract originally offered to A.B.D.C. was based on quite a differentpolitical make-up.4. Before giving this warning, the Chairman of the I.T.A. consulted me on what seemed to him to be mainly a political affair. I felt that I could hardlydecline his request for an expression of my own views, and I therefore told him that I strongly agreed with him. In view, however, of the possible repercussions,I feel that I should inform my colleagues of the position.5. A.B.D.C. is now negotiating with Littler&apos;s entertainment group and withBirmingham firms, and in case the company comes back to the I.T.A. with aCopy No.    gl47233
suggestion to include any active political right-wing element, I have asked theChairman not to sanction any agreement until I have let him know further. I have asked him also to make it clear that any agreement that the company may come towill be very carefully looked at before being approved.&apos; 6. I am told by the I.T.A. that if A.B.D.C. has to fall out for any reason, theLittler group in association with the Daily Mirror would most likely take their place.7.   There are certain other points which I would propose to deal with orally.D.General Post Office, E.C. 1,30th November, 1954.
