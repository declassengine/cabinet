secret.(54) 39214th December, 1954CABINET3 A PAN AND THE GENERAL AGREEMENT on tariffs AND trade memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI am writing this paper without having had an opportunity of seeing the memorandum which, I understand, the Foreign Secretary is circulating tothe Cabinet on this subject.    I gather, however, that his recommendations are:-(a) that we should drop the proposals agreed by the Cabineton 20th October (C.C.(54) 68th Conclusions, Minute 8);(b) that we should decide now not to invoke Article XXXV ofthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.)against Japan;(c) that officials should be instructed to consider alternative means within the G.A.cabinet. of securing safeguards against Japan.2. I readily agree with the proposal at (a).    Both Japan and theU.S.A. dislike this proposal and in the circumstances it would clearly standno chance of success in the G.A.T.T.3. I strongly urge my colleagues to take no decision at present on(b).    The question of Japanese accession to the G.A.T.T, is unlikely to arise for many months and there is no need to take a decision until itdoes.    It raises issues of very great significance - not only in the sphere of foreign relations but also in domestic politics (feeling in Lancashire isintense on the subject) and in our relations with Commonwealth Governments,In my judgment no decision on this far-reaching issue should be takenexcept upon the basis of a paper which would bring out fully all these graveconsiderations,4. I suggest that officials of the Departments concerned (the treasury the Foreign Office, the Commonwealth Relations Office and the Board ofTrade) should be instructed to proceed forthwith with the preparation of a paper on the lines suggested in the preceding paragraph.    The paper could include a study of the possibilities of securing some alternative safeguardingprovisions within the G.A.T.T.; that question has, however, already beenfully explored and I am sceptical of our being able to find any solution whichcould be negotiated in the G.A.T.T. and yet would give satisfactory safe-guards for British industry.5. I propose also that officials should continue preparation of aCommercial Treaty with Japan..    The Japanese Government have asked forone and if it were decided to invoke Article XXXV we might be able to ease the situation by announcing at the same time that we were negotiating sucha Treaty.P.T.Board of Trade, S0W.l.13th December, 1954.COPY NO.
