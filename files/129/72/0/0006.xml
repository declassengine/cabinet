(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA.JESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)SECRET-,-- f/C.(54) 356 COPY NO.   6^23rd November, 1954CABINETCOLONIAL, immigrants memorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations my colleagues will expect me to advise what are likely to be there actions of Commonwealth countries to the Home Secretary&apos;s proposal inC. (54) 354o    I think it will be convenient for them to have my impressionsin this short paper.    I can say*at once that I agree with his proposal forthe appointment of a Departmental Committee to study this question.2.        I should have preferred that the terms of reference of thisCommittee should be confined to the question of admission and that weshould announce that we are prepared to legislate to take powers to deportCommonwealth citizens not belonging to the United Kingdom if they are found to be undesirable members of the community, whether by reason ofconviction for criminal offences or otherwise, or if they are persistentlydependent upon National Assistance.    I am sure that we ought to havethese powers, and I think all the Ministers who have considered thisquestion were prepared to recommend legislation for this purpose.    nor do I think we should underrate   the deterrent effect which the announcementand early passage of such legislation would have on immigrants of thekind which is troubling us;  and there is some risk that the bare announce-ment of the appointment of a Committee may lead to forestalling.3.        I do not consider that we should have difficulty with commonwealth governments about such a proposal.    All of them except India and Pakistanhave powers to deport Bi-itish subjects which, from time to time, they use against United Kingdom citizens.    If, however, there is no prospect of getting the necessary legislation into the programme for the coming session,I agree this should be referred to the Departmental Committee.4.        If we are to get wise and practical recommendations from theCommittee, and avoid trouble when we come to take action, the committee must have all the problems fully set before them;  and I think they will find that the enquiry will take longer than some expects     If the Committeeis to include someone with special knowledge of the purely Colonial sideof the problem, then I must ask for the inclusion of someone with asimilar knowledge of those aspects which concern the self-governingCommonwealth, countries.     The effect of any restrictions on entry uponcitizens of these countries is an integral part of this problem.    any action which may weaken the ties which help to bind the Commonwealthtogether is a matter of direct interest to the United Kingdom, and it isimportant that this side of the question should be given full weight.
2Cf5. I appreciate the force of the contention that, if we are to legislate for restrictions on the entry of British subjects into the United Kingdomand their employment here, the legislation should be non^discriminatoryin form.    This will not, however, conceal the fact that the problem withwhich we are in fact concerned is that of colotired immigrants from colonial territories.    In fact we shall welcome the comparatively fewgood young Canadians or New Zealanders who wish to work here, whilerestricting an excessive number of West Indians or West Africans.    other commonwealth countries have this problem.    And the fact that in some instances their legislation is non-discriminatory in form while their administration is discriminatory in practice has been strongly objected toby india    But we too shall have to discriminate in pra.ctice if we are&quot;to operate with the minimum of inconvenience to Commonwealth citizens&quot;.6.        The old Commonwealth countries have powers to control the admission of British subjects.    They therefore could not reasonably objectif we do the same.    But I should expect them to look at the substance ofwhat we propose rather than the form.    Unless we are in a position togive the public in Commonwealth countries some assurance as to howrestriction on entry will work in practice, we must expect to be criticised by the public and Press in these countries.    I fear this may deterCommonwealth citizens who come here in large numbers not only as short-term visitors but in order to study or to take employment or to try theirluck.7.        The Home Secretary suggests that it will be neither necessary nordesirable to extend the control to citizens of the Irish Republic.    I fully appreciate that for practical reasons it would be difficult to control traffic between the Irish Republic and Great Britain.    But I fear we shall be criticised in Commonwealth countries if we give to citizens of the irish republic, which has left the Commonwealth, more favoured treatmentthan we give to the Commonwealth countries themselves.8.        It will, as the Home Secretary says, be necessary before any announcement is made to give Commonwealth Governments its text andto explain to them what is in our minds.SWINTONCommonwealth Relations Office, S. W.l.22nd November, 1954.
