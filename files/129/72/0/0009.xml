THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER   BRITANNIC MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 1954SECRETC. (54) 35925th November, 1954CABINET&quot;HORROR COMICS&quot;Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of EducationThere has in recent weeks been strong pressure in Parliament and in the press for action to prevent the publication and sale of &quot; horror comics.&quot; Deputationsfrom the Educational Institute of Scotland, the Glasgow Corporation and theChurch of England Council for Education (which was led by the archbishop of Canterbury) have urged that the Government should introduce legislation todeal with the matter, and a resolution to that effect has been passed by the ChurchAssembly. The National Union of Teachers recently staged an exhibition inLondon which displayed, without any attempt at sensationalism, some of the worstexamples of these comics together with examples of well-known children&apos;s comicsand newspapers which are regarded as harmless. This exhibition is to be shownlater in various provincial centres and the publicity it has already attracted is likelyto intensify the demand for public action.2. The publications concerned are magazines containing strip cartoonsdealing in a very objectionable way with stories of horror and violence. Manyof them are printed from matrices imported from America, and some of the firmsknown to be responsible for their publication have considerable experience of publishing literature which is on the border-line, and has sometimes been overthe border-line, of obscenity.3. The most objectionable feature of these publications is the excessiveemphasis which they place on acts of brutality, crime and cruelty. Although thedifference between them and the well-known children&apos;s comics which have been published in this country for many years, and which also contain scenes of violence,is in a sense one of degree, it is so marked that the two classes of publication wouldbe regarded by most people as being wholly different in character.4. The difference is not, however, readily definable, and this is what makes the problem so difficult. If legislation were introduced with the object ofprohibiting the sale of &quot; horror comics&quot; there is some danger that, howevercarefully it were drafted, it might be held to expose unobjectionable publicationsto the danger of prosecution.5. The case for legislation, which was put forward very persuasively by the archbishop of Canterbury, is briefly this. The existing law provides machineryby which the distribution of obscene publications can be prevented. It is generally agreed that such machinery is necessary, at any rate for the protection of children and young persons. It is for a court to decide whether a particular publication isobscene, but there is no statutory definition of obscenity and it has come to beregarded, as a result of judicial decisions, as being restricted to matter related tosex. These objectionable comics are not obscene within the meaning of theexisting law, but they are just as harmful, if not more harmful, to children and young persons as publications which are obscene, and the courts ought to be giventhe same power to prevent their circulation as they have to prevent the circulation of obscene publications. It would be no more difficult for a court to decide whethera publication was harmful because of its excessive emphasis on horror, crime orcruelty than it is to decide whether a publication is obscene.47205Copy No.
6. If the premise that these publications are harmful to young people is accepted (which must be a matter of opinion rather than of fact) it is difficult to resist the logic of the conclusion except on the ground that the mischief is on a scale too small to justify legislation or that the remedy is worse than the disease.7. As regards the scale of the mischief, it is very difficult to find out howwidely objectionable comics are circulated, at present, because they are not handled by reputable booksellers or newsagents. It is even more difficult to discover howfar they are read by children and young persons. We understand, however, thatthe National Union of Teachers found no difficulty in obtaining, for the purposeof their exhibition, quite large supplies of objectionable comics, which were broughtvoluntarily to school by the children. It seems that most of these were purchased by adults, but it is clear that they do come into the hands of children.8. The question whether the remedy is worse than the disease would dependon the form of the legislation, and we append proposals which include suchsafeguards against the unreasonable use of the new powers as we have been ableto devise.9. We do not think that anything short of legislation on these lines (such asthe appointment of a Royal Commission or the establishment of an advisorycouncil by the printing and distributive trades) would be an effective solution ofthis problem, and the choice seems to us to lie between a decision to leave it to public opinion and the efforts of parents and teachers to bring the circulation ofobjectionable comics to an end, and the introduction of legislation. Our feeling is that in the present state of public opinion it will not be possible to deal withthe matter except by legislation and that if there is to be legislation it ought to beintroduced by the Government. The proposals in the appendix contain features(e.g., the part to be played by the Director of Public Prosecutions and the provisions for the search of premises and seizure of publications by the police) which wouldnot be appropriate in a Private Member&apos;s Bill, and, moreover, it seems to usimportant in a question of this kind that the Government should take the initiativerather than leave it to a private member.10. If our colleagues agree with this view it will be important that some statement of the Governments intention to introduce legislation should be made before the ballot for Private Members&apos; Bills next Session. If this is not done itis very likely that a Private Member will choose this as a subject for a Bill, whichmight make it difficult for the Government to introduce legislation. We do not suggest that any mention of the proposed legislation should be included in the queen&apos;s Speech but that a statement might be made during the Debate on the address that the Government have decided that legislation is required and thatthey will introduce it in due course, as soon as the details of the drafting, whichwill present considerable difficulty, have been settled.11.   We accordingly seek the authority of our colleagues (i) to have a Bill drafted on the lines of the proposals in the appendix;(ii) to arrange for a statement to be made during the Debate on the Addresson the lines indicated in paragraph 10.G. LL.-G.J. S.D. E.24th November, 1954.
APPENDIXPROPOSALS FOR legislation. The most difficult problem will be to provide an effective machinery which can be rapidly put into operation for preventing the publication or saleof objectionable comics without exposing to the danger of prosecution comics inwhich the subject matter is treated with such restraint that it is unlikely to havea harmful effect on children and young persons reading it. It is not possible to distinguish between the two types of comic by definition, and some authority willhave to decide which publications are to be brought before the courts. To setup a special body for this purpose is not an acceptable solution because it savourstoo much of arbitrary censorship. On the other hand, to leave the decision tothe police (or possibly, on the analogy of the cinema, to local authorities) might lead to difficulties from variations in the standard adopted. It seems that thebest solution will be to provide that in England and Wales no prosecution shouldbe undertaken except with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.It is the practice for the Director to be consulted about similar proceedings inconnection with obscene publications, and, although this new responsibility might involve a good deal of work at the beginning, it is probable that if there are anumber of successful prosecutions the few firms who are at present printingobjectionable comics from plates imported from America will cease to do so. InScotland all prosecutions would be controlled by the Lord Advocate.2. The scope of the legislation can to some extent be restricted by limitingits application to publications in a specified form and dealing with specifiedsubjects. Apart from this, it will be necessary to give the courts a wide discretion to decide whether or not a particular publication is unsuitable for reading bychildren and young persons.3. The publications to which the Bill should apply would be publicationsconsisting wholly or mainly of pictorial representations of stories about real orimaginary events in which there are depicted:  (a) the commission of crimes; or(b) acts of violence or cruelty; or(c) the actions of supernatural or monstrous creatures.4. It should be an offence to publish, distribute or retail any such publication,if any of the stories contained in it are depicted in such a way that it is unsuitable for reading by a child (under 14) or a young person (under 17), as being likely orcalculated to have a frightening or corrupting effect on him, or to encourage orincite him to acts of cruelty or crime. It should be made clear that the court isrequired to look at each story as a whole and that its decision should not be basedon isolated incidents, and also that the court is to pay particular regard to thepictorial element.5. The police should be empowered to obtain a justices&apos; warrant to enter and search any premises in which they have reason to believe that publications to whichthe Bill applies are being kept for the purpose of sale or distribution and to seizesuch publications pending consideration of a prosecution. They should also havepower to seize such publications which are exhibited for sale in any public place.Unless a prosecution is instituted within 28 days the police should be required toreturn the publications. The period of 28 days is intended to allow time for theDirector of Public Prosecutions to consider whether he should give his consent to a prosecution.6. The consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions should not be requiredin the case of proceedings in respect of any publication which has been ordered to be destroyed by another court.   It should be sufficient, in order to prove an
offence, to establish to the satisfaction of the court that a destruction order has previously been made.7. The penalties might be a fine not exceeding  50 on summary convictionfor a first offence, or for second and subsequent offences a fine not exceeding  100or three months&apos; imprisonment. The court should have power to order thedestruction of publications in respect of which a conviction has been recorded andalso of the plates from which they are printed.8. The existing powers to seize obscene publications discovered in the courseof customs examination or in transmission through the post should be extended topublications to which the Bill applies and the matrices from which they may be printed.
