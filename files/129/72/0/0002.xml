fHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF  HER   BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1954SECRETC. (54) 35222nd November, 1954CABINETREDISTRIBUTION OF seats memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and theSecretary of State for scotland we have already circulated copies of the reports of the Boundary Commissionsfor England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (Cmds. 9311-9314), and we nowannex a note analysing the Commissions&apos; recommendations.2. The Commissions&apos; proposals appear in general to be well founded, andwe think that they should have the Government^ full support, both on merits and because it seems important to establish the principle that the recommendations ofthese impartial bodies should be accepted unless there is a particularly strongreason to the contrary.; 3. This applies in particular to the English Commission^ proposals for increases and reductions of representation mentioned in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the analysis. It also applies to those of their recommendations for the rearrangement of constituencies which are designed to eliminate constituencies with electoratesbelow 40,000 or above; 80,000, or to secure a better balance between urban and rural representation by increasing urban and decreasing rural electorates(paragraph 8 of the analysis). :4. It is open to doubt, hov/ever, whether some of the other changes mentionedin paragraph 8 of the analysis have enough to commend them to outweigh theobjections to frequent changes of constituency boundaries. The EnglishCommission make it clear that they felt this themselves: they made some recom&apos;mendations only because they fell obliged by the terms of the Act to do so for the sake of greater numerical equality. If in the case of any of them it becomesclear that the recommendation has no support, we should be disinclined to forceit through.5. The English Commission in paragraphs 19 and 20 of their report proposetwo changes in the existing law:  (a) At present the Commissions must carry out a general review of constitu-. ! encies at intervals not exceeding 7 years. The Commission suggesti.      that this period should be extended.   There will be general support for this. We think an interval of 10-12 years would be appropriate,bearing in mind that Jthe Commissions can at any time recommendchanges in the boundaries of particular constituencies.&apos;(b) At present the Commissions in some instances feel bound to recommendchanges in order to produce numerical equality where there is not muchwrong with existing boundaries. The Commission suggest that theyshould be relieved of this obligation. This suggestion will be generally welcomed.       &apos;. . :   -6. These changes can be made only by legislation which could be introduced at any time before the next review is due to take place. We should like to have authority, however, to say in the debate, if the matter is raised, that the Governmentare prepared to consider sympathetically the introduction of such legislation at a convenient time after consultation with the Opposition,     .47182 copy No.
7.   We accordingly ask the Cabinet to decide\:^, ( (a) that the Government should give full support to the recommendations of&apos;/ the Commissions, other than any recommendation made merely to, ,   ;   secure numerical equality and which proves to have no parliamentarysupport; .&apos;.&apos;u\  ,1-;(b) that sympathetic consideration should be promised to the suggested.... L......... amendments in the law referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 above.       . ,G. LL.-G.y:y.oo      ., /TruMmry -       , . , - ,-, -. J. S.19th November, 1954.ANNEXREDISTRIBUTION OF SEATSAnalysis of Boundary Commissions&apos; RecommendationsEngland (Cmd. 9311)1. The; rules for redistribution are reproduced in Appendix B of theCommission^ report. In brief, they require that the existing number of constituencies is not to be altered substantially; that so far as is practicable without causing excessive disparities between electorates each county, county borough and metropolitan borough is to have separate representation and is not to share a constituency with another local government area, and no non-county borough orurban or rural district is to be split between two constituencies; that subject tothese requirements the electorates of constituencies are to be as nearly equal as is practicable; but that a Commission may depart from these rules if specialgeographical considerations make this desirable.2. In&apos;giving effect to these rules the Commission considered that in generalcompact urban constituencies could support larger electorates than scattered ruralconstituencies (but they gave less weight to this consideration than at the lastgeneral review in 1947); and they avoided proposing constituencies with electoratesof less than 40,000 or more than 80,000.  (In 1947 the upper limit was 88,000.)3. The basis of the Commission^ recommendations was an allocation of seats to each geographical county in proportion to its electorate.4. The Commission, having started their review in 1953, were required to base their recommendations on 1953 electorates; but they have also taken note oftrends indicated by the 1954 figures which have since become available.5; The average electorate of the existing 506 constituencies in England was57,122 in 1953 and 57,156 in 1954. The average for the 511 constituencies proposedby the Commission is 56,564 on 1953 figures and 56,597 on 1954 figures.6.  The Commission propose additional seats in the following counties:  : ;Cheshire       ...... 1 Middlesex     ...      ... 1Essex ....      :..      ... 2 Staffordshire ...... 1Hampshire    ...... 1 Surrey          ...      ... 1^Hertfordshire;..      ... 1 East Sussex ....... 1!;XKent   ...      ...      ... 1 Warwickshire^..... 1Particulars, see Appendix E, are as follows:   , If; \Cheshire.^-A new county constituency of Nantwich is1 proposed for parts ofthe existing Nbrthwich and Crewe constituencies.

One of the two constituencies at Reading (with a total electorateonly just exceeding 80,000) is to be abolished. One ward of Reading CountyBorough is to be included in the Newbury county constituency and one in theWokingham county constituency (paragraph 1).Lancashire. One of the constituencies at Blackburn (with a total electorateonly just exceeding 80,000) is to be abolished and three wards of BlackburnCounty Borough are to be included in the Darwen county constituency. a consequential transfer of territory from Darwen to Chorley is proposed.The Droylsden constituency is to be abolished; one of the urban districts ofwhich it consists is to be included in the Ashton under Lyne constituency and theremaining three urban districts in two Manchester constituencies. A consequentialrearrangement of seven of the nine Manchester constituencies is proposed(paragraph 10).London. The two Fulham and the two Hammersmith constituencies are tobe replaced by three constituencies, one in Fulham, one in Hammersmith and oneto be shai&quot;ed between them (paragraph 12).Yorkshire, West Riding. Leeds and Sheffield are each to lose one constituencyand in consequence the remaining constituencies are to be rearranged(paragraph 22).The Commission comment on these reductions in paragraphs 17 and (asregards London) 18 of their report. The statistical basis for them is shown in thefollowing table:  		Total	Present	Average	Proposed	AverageCounty	Year	electorate	seats	electorate	seats	electorateBerkshire      ......	1953	282,215	6	47,036	5	56,443	1954	284,126		47,354		56,825Lancashire     ......	1953	3,568,247	64	55,754	62	57,552	1954	3,555,250		55,551		57,343London	1953	2,425,167	43	56,399	42	57,742- &apos;	1954	2,401,255		55,853		57,173&apos;Yorkshire, West Riding	1953	2,516,614	46	54,709	44	57,196	1954	2,509,808		54,561		57,046(County boroughs 						Leeds     ......	1953	357,434	7	51,062	6	59,572	1954	356,491		50,927		59,415Sheffield......	1953	367,470	7	52,496	6	61,245	1954	363,885		51,984		60,648)8. Rearrangements of constituencies designed to produce less unequalelectorates are proposed in the following counties (including some of those mentioned in paragraphs 6 and 7 above):  Derbyshire. Middlesex.Devonshire. Northumberland. &quot;.&apos;Durham. Nottingham.Gloucestershire. Staffordshire.Hampshire. Surrey.Lancashire. Yorkshire, East Riding.Leicestershire. Yorkshire, West Riding.London.Particulars, see Appendix E, are as follows:  Derbyshire. It is proposed to transfer two parishes from South-EastDerbyshire to Derby North and Derby South (paragraph 3).. Devonshire. The boundary between Plymouth, Devonport and Plymouth,Sutton is to be adjusted (paragraph 4).
Durham. Both the Gateshead constituencies now have electorates of less than40,000, and it is proposed to transfer an urban district from Jarrow to GatesheadEast, and two wards from Gateshead East to Gateshead West. Jarrow is tobecome a borough instead of a county constituency (paragraph 5).Gloucestershire. Transfers are proposed from Cirencester and Tewkesburyto Stroud and from Stroud to South Gloucestershire; two urban districts now inCirencester and Tewkesbury are to be included in two Bristol constituencies; andall the Bristol constituencies are to be rearranged. The main effect of these changes would be to increase the average electorate of the Bristol constituencies and reduce that of the county constituencies in Gloucestershire (paragraph 7).Hampshire. Some adjustments are proposed at Southampton, mainly as aresult of the extension of the county borough (paragraph 16).Lancashire. Two parishes in the West Lancashire rural district were includedin 1948 in Liverpool, Walton and Crosby because the Local Government boundary commission had provisionally decided that they should be incorporated in neighbouring boroughs. This decision was not carried out, and accordingly theseparishes are now to be transferred to the Ormskirk constituency which contains the rest of the rural district.Litherland urban district is to be transferred from Bootle to Crosby.The Liverpool constituencies are to be rearranged (paragraph 10).Leicestershire. An urban district is to be transferred from the countyconstituency of Harborough to Leicester South East (paragraph 11).London. The electorate of Stoke Newington and Hackney North nowexceeds 80,000, and to correct this, three wards of Hackney are to be attached toBethnal Green and the rest of Hackney and Stoke Newington are to be rearranged(paragraph 12).Middlesex. The three constituencies in Harrow are to be rearranged(paragraph 13).Northumberland. The boundary between Newcastle West and NewcastleCentral is to be adjusted (paragraph 14).Nottingham. It is proposed to abolish the Broxtowe constituency and tocreate a new Ashfield constituency from parts of Broxtowe and Mansfield. Twourban districts are to be transferred to Mansfield from Bassetlaw and Newark;some territory is to be transferred from Broxtowe to Rushcliffe; an urban districtis to be transferred from Rushcliffe to Nottingham South and another fromBroxtowe to Nottingham North; and the constituencies in Nottingham countyborough are to be rearranged. The general effect is to increase the averageelectorate of the constituencies in Nottingham county borough (paragraph 15).Staffordshire. The boundary between Wolverhampton North East andWolverhampton South West is to be adjusted (paragraph 17).Surrey. The three constituencies in Croydon are to be rearranged(paragraph 18).Yorkshire, East Riding. The Haltemprice urban district was included in 1948in one of the Kingston-upon-Hull constituencies because the Local GovernmentBoundary Commission had provisionally decided that it should be included in thecounty borough. This decision has not been put into effect, and it is nowproposed to detach the Haltemprice urban district from Kingston-upon-Hull, andto divide the county borough into three new constituencies instead of four. TheBeverley constituency is also to be abolished; a new constituency of Haltemprice isto be formed from the Haltemprice urban district and part of the existing Beverleyconstituency; and a new Howden constituency is to be formed from the remainder of Beverley with parts of the Bridlington constituency (paragraph 21).Yorkshire, West Riding. It is proposed to transfer an urban district fromHemsworth to Wakefield.It is also proposed to transfer an urban district from Penistone to Colne Valleyand another from Colne Valley to Huddersfield East, and to adjust the boundarybetween Huddersfield East and Huddersfield West.In addition, it is proposed to transfer an urban district from Dewsbury toBrighouse and Spenborough and another from Brighouse and Spenborough toBradford South and to rearrange the Bradford constituencies (paragraph 22).The Commission make some comments on these proposals in paragraphs 13and 14 of their report.
9. In the following counties minor changes details are in Appendix D only are proposed to bring cqnstituency boundaries again into line with recentlyaltered local boundaries:  Bedfordshire.West Sussex.Worcestershire.Similar changes, in addition to those already mentioned, are proposed in thefollowing counties:- l: &apos;Gloucestershire.Hampshire.Kent.Lancashire.Leicestershire.London.Staffs.East Sussex.10. No changes are proposed in the following counties (details inAppendix C):        clBuckinghamshire.Cambridgeshire.Cornwall.    &apos;Cumberland.Dorset.Isle of Ely.Herefordshire.Huntingdonshire.Lincolnshire-Holland.Kesteven andLindsey. ^-si-Rutlandshire.Norfolk.Northamptonshire and Soke ofPeterborough.Oxfordshire.Shropshire.SomersetSuffolk (East and West).Westmorland.Isle of Wight.Wiltshire.Yorks, North Riding.11. In the course of the proceedings on the Representation of the People Bill,1948, the recommendations of the Boundary Commission were altered in two important respects. First, the Commission had recommended, with somehesitation, that eight boroughs with electorates of between 80,000 and 88,000 shouldeach have only one seat. These were Battersea, Blackburn, East Ham, Gateshead,Hammersmith, Norwich, Paddington and Reading. The Bill was amended to giveeach of them two seats. It is now proposed that Blackburn and Reading should lose their second seats; that Hammersmith should have one seat and share a secondwith: Fulham; and that Gateshead should take in an urban district so that theelectorates of its two seats may be brought nearer the national average.Secondly, nine large boroughs were each given one seat more than theCommission had recommended on the ground that the average electorate perconstituency in these boroughs would have been rather high under the Commission^proposals. These boroughs were: Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Leeds, Leicester,Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham and Sheffield. It is now proposed that Leeds andSheffield should each lose a seat, and that Bradford, Bristol, Leicester, manchester and Nottingham should all take in adjoining urban districts to boost their averageelectorates. The Commission refer to these changes in paragraphs 14, 17 and(as regards London) 18 of their report.-! : 12. The Commission found themselves unable to secure a fair distribution of seats without proposing a number of constituencies consisting of part of a boroughtogether with an adjoining district. Possibly the most striking instances are reading and Blackburn: some of the wards of each of these are to be included in adjoiningcounty comtitoenj53)SS-?::--,i;Ttie situation pf Reading closely resembles that of Luton,which was accorded similar treatment in 1948. Another instance is the inclusionof a ward of Birmingham in the Sutton Coldfield constituency. In London, Fulhamhas to share a seatwith, Hammersinith and Hackney with Bethnal Green: this iscomparable &quot;&apos;to*&apos;&quot;&apos;t!he&apos;&quot;l&apos;948 arrangements for Chelsea and Hackney and StokeNewington.., pther qases where.a constituency is proposed which will consist ofpart of a large borough &quot;and an adjoining&apos; urban districti are at Manchester,Huddersfield, Bradford, Walsall, D^e^b^,.,Gateishead,MBrist9U Leicester, Nottinghama.nd Heston andjsleworth. A few similarconstituencies exist? already-for instanceat Preston and:at:Newcastle:upon-Tyhe.:&apos;&apos; .-.-v-It is noteworthy that nearly all the proposed constituencies mentioned in thisparagrapH-tere^^S ^n^h^,Ih&apos;;p^iragftiiph,-&apos;lil&apos;- aboV&amp; 1   1    e    &apos;
Wales (Cmd. 9313) . ^   - 113. The Boundary Commission for Wales propose only three minor adjust-ments to bring constituency boundaries again into line with recently altered localboundaries. These are mentioned in paragraph 10 of the Commission^ report.Northern Ireland (Cmd. 9314)14. The Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland recommend no changes,and no action is required.Scotland (Cmd. 9312)15. The rules for redistribution of seats in Scotland are reproduced inAppendix A of Cmd. 9312. These rules require that the existing number of constituencies (71) should not be reduced; that no Scottish burgh other than a county of a city should be partly in one constituency and partly in another; andthat no county should share a constituency with another local government area or part of such area.16. The Scottish Commission has not proposed that any constituency shouldbe abolished or that any entirely new constituency should be created. their proposals may be summarised as follows:  Major changes(i) The Glasgow ConstituenciesAlterations are proposed to the following twelve out of the city&apos;s fifteenconstituencies:  Scotstoun. Camlachie.Hillhead. Bridgeton.Woodside. Pollock.Kelvingrove. Govan.Central. Tradeston.Springburn. Gorbals.Camlachie constituency, as altered, is to be renamed Provan. Tradeston will cease to be a constituency name and a new constituency name-Craigton-will come into use.These changes, which are all inter-related, are necessary to correct undulysmall electorates in the Central, Kelvingrove and Woodside constituencies.The Commission state that these proposals have secured general acceptance.(ii) Midlothian and Peebles, Roxburgh and SelkirkPeeblesshire is to be transferred from Midlothian and Peebles constituency(which is to be renamed Midlothian constituency) to Roxburgh and Selkirkconstituency (which is to be renamed Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles constituency).The justification for this change is that the electorate in the present Midlothianand Peebles constituency is already substantially above the average and further increases are inevitable in the electorate of Midlothian County which is an expanding mining area.The Commission state that this proposal was opposed by the local Labourand Liberal interests.Proposals to Remedy Lesser Disparities in Electorates(i) Edinburgh &apos;  &quot; *    t^ ,&apos;Alterations are proposed to the West, North, Pentlands and Centralconstituencies of Edinburgh.; The Commission state that no objections were made to these proposals;    1 1(ii) East Aberdeenshire, West AberdeenshirePart of East Aberdeenshire constituency is to be transferred to WestAberdeenshire;&apos;.   -v::--:\^ v;j:rx, - ; *    IW v&apos; &apos; ;     - ;&apos;[&apos;The Commission state that no objections were made to this proposal.
Minor changes to bring constituency boundaries into line with altered local governmentboundaries, adjustments are proposed in the constituencies of Bute and NorthAyrshire and Central Ayrshire; Stirling and Falkirk Burghs and West Stirlingshire;Edinburgh East and Midlothian; West Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen North andAberdeen South.The Commission state that none of these minor proposals aroused any objection.
