The text was made available to me by the New ZealandHigh Commissioner^ Office.2. The comments made by the New Zealand officials are in generalaccord with the views we have already expressed.A.E.Foreign Office, S. W.1,26th November, 1954.
Off &quot;Shore islands in the absence of a Minister following are departmental commentswhich may help you in further discussions with State Department,1. It seems to us that the publication of the joint statement only(even if the treaty text should also be released) and not the exchange of notes would inevitably raise issue as to whether Formosa is a privilegedsanctuary from which Nationalists can launch attacks on the mainland.We know that this is not the case and feel that failure to disclose the true position will only injure United States and make operation &quot;Oracle&quot; evenmore difficult than it need be.    As it is Dulles&apos; intention to publish the notes at some stage we feel he should be urged to take this hurdle now.It would certainly improve the position of our Government which will obviously be under great and almost irresistible pressure to make astatement on the point.2.        Regarding the statement itself, we should like to see the specificreferences to the various treaties already concluded in the Pacific areadropped from the text.     The patent linking of these various documentswill certainly raise here questions concerning recognition of communist china which we feel can and should be avoided.     We therefore suggestdeletion of all words after &quot;established&quot; in the first sentence ofparagraph 3, and that they should be replaced by some such phrase as&quot;by the various collective defence treaties already concluded between theUnited States and other powers in the general area of the Pacific &quot;.3.        Neither the treaty nor the exchange of notes seem to impose any limitation upon activities of those Nationalist troops v/hich are at present on the off-shore islands.    Presumably they would be (in theory at least)free to attack the mainland or adjoining islands in Communist hands.Since this possibility has not been covered by the treaty we  should liketo know whether the Americans have any understanding with the nationalists about the behaviour of these forces,4.        So far as concerns the submission of the question to the security council, we undertook to go ahead at the appropriate time and still feelthat this operation can be helpful.    We feel also that it would bedesirable to move as quickly as possible after publication of statement and exchange of notes.    However, we detect a certain lack of enthusiasm. -or at least a note of reserve - in Mr. Dulles&apos; statement about &quot;Oracle&quot;.Is it that he now wishes to allow some time to elapse after issue of thejoint statement in order to assess the situation in the light of reactions?We should like to be clearer on this point and on his views as to timing of our resolution.    Obviously, we must also have regard to the UnitedKingdom views.5.        As the Americans will be informing the Australians about thetreaty negotiations we think our role should be to supplement this bytelling them of the progress of operation &quot;Oracle&quot; and this can probablybest be done by you.
