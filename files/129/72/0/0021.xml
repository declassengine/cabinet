^7(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENT)secret.(54) 371 COPY NO.1st December, 1954.CABINETSUDAN; C L&apos; MPSNSATION AND PENSIONS,FOR OFFICIALSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in C. (54) 370 the Foreign Secretary has asked thatsupplementary compensation payments totalling  140,000 should be made by her Majesty&apos;s Government to displaced British officials in the Sudan;  andthat Her Majesty&apos;s Government should state their intention of pressing the sudanese Government to include a guarantee of pensions in the final hand-over Agreement, and should themselves guarantee these pensions in the interim period.    My difficulty in accepting certain features of these proposal is based partly on the history of the case and partly on my genuine anxietynot to create an awkward precedent which might result in mounting expenseelsewhere.    I should like to put my views before my colleagues.C OMPE NSA T ION2.        (a)      The main reason advanced by the Governor-General and supported by the Foreign Secretary for a supplementarypayment by Her Majesty&apos;s Government is that the Governor-Generals faith is pledged to the expatriate officials.    Thesuggestion that the maximum rate of compensation shouldbe as high as  8,750 first appeared in a telegram from theGovernor-General in early March reporting that he had told the Expatriates Association that he considered this figure fair and reasonable and that he &quot;stood on&quot; it.We none of us interpreted this as involving a commitment on Her Majesty&apos;s Government to make upanything the Sudanese offered to  8,750.    For exampleafter consultation with the Treasury, the Foreign Officeinformed the Governor-General that, although he was at liberty to try and secure this maximum from the sudan government if he could, Her Majesty&apos;s Government fortheir part would consider a maximum of  8,000 not unreasonable.    In subsequent correspondence theGovernor-General attempted to justify the  8,750 on merits.    Even in reporting the passage of the Sudaneselaw providing for  8,000, he said, not that he felt bound by his assurance to secure  8,750, but that  &quot;he would feel that he had more fully discharged his duty under the self Government Statute to ensure fair and equitabletreatment of all officials, if there was some smallimprovement in compensation&quot;.
It is only comparatively recently that the question ofpledged faith has come up.    It seems to arise from theinterpretation which the Expatriates Association hassubsequently placed on what the Governor-General saidto them in March.    We have all along been at pains toavoid commitment to  8,750, which is the figure whichthe Expatriates Association are now pressing upon us.So I consider it reasonable to state that Her Majesty&apos;governments faith has not been pledged.    The Governor-General is in a difficult position, but should he not make an extra effort to demonstrate to the expatriates that hehas done everything in his power to secure for themfair and reasonable treatment?(b) The question next arises whether the compensation shouldbe  8,750 rather than  8,000.      8,000 was the maximumin the Gold Coast.    Put briefly, I do not believe that it is sound to try and pick out particular features in the SudanService, and argue therefrom that compensation in theSudan should be higher than in the Gold Coast.    one cannot prove that any figure is intrinsically right and fair for all territories.    One must take each territory as it arises, and looked at broadly there is nothing wrong in  8,000 as a maximum for the Sudan.(c) The suggestion that we should represent the proposedsupplement as an ex gratia payment for good services would not, I fear, help to avoid repercussions.    indeed it might well increase the danger of them, since in futureColonial cases, even where compensation was admittedlyreasonable, officials would argue that they were just asmuch entitled to a separate reward for good services asofficials in the Sudan.The danger of repercussions in Colonial territoriesis very considerable.    If officials see that a sux:plementarypayment has been made by Her Majesty&apos;s Government inone case, they will surely seek to obtain a similar payment in their own.    There being no absolute standard ofreasonableness in these matters, it can always berepresented that the sum fixed is not enough.The conclusion I come to therefore is that I mustadvise my colleagues that if they should decide to authorisethe proposed payment, it should be publicly stated that ithas been made necessary in this case by a pledge given inthe course of negotiations by which Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentbecame unwittingly involved in a commitment, and that nosuch supplementary payment can be entertained in futurecases.ENSIGNS3. I agree that we can give the proposed assurance about our intention to incorporate full safeguards for the payment of pensions in a formal agreement with the Sudan Government at the stage of self-determination.I accept the first three paragraphs of the proposed assurance annexed to theForeign Secretary&apos;s paper.    But I am afraid I see serious objections to theprocedure suggested in the last paragraph, which offers a guarantee by
oHer Majesty&apos;s Government   of the payment of pensions in the interim period.    The arguments about this are necessarily lengthy, and are set outin an appendix.SUMMARY4. My views on the proposals in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s papermay therefore be summarised as follows:-(1)     I feel that the expatriates have already had a reasonablyfair deal over compensation, and that the Governor-Geaeral should attempt, in order to avoid repercussions,to hold the position with what has already been done.(2)    I agree that an assurance can be given that we intend to secure a firm guarantee of pensions by the sudan government in the final hand-over Agreement.(3)    I am opposed to any guarantee of pensions by her Majesty&apos;s Government in the interim period for reasons as set out, particularly in paragraph 2 of theappendix.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.1st December, 1954.APPENDIXProposed Form of Assurance on Pensions to begiven by Her ivr-jesty&apos;s Government in the Interim period in the first place an assurance in the terms suggested in thelast paragraph of the annex to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s paper would beconstitutionally improper.     It involves a contingent financial commitment,and the rights of Parliament must be safeguarded.     In entering into such a commitment one of three courses must be adopted:  either there must beenabling legislation, or a token estimate with a description of the service mustbe presented to Parliament, or we must state the circumstances in which the commitment might become operative and make our assurance subject toParliament voting the necessary funds.    We should all wish to avoid thefirst two courses: and it would therefore be necessary to adopt the third.2. Any assurance on the matter would be bound to become public knowledge and the right course therefore would be to apprise Parliament ofour intention.     This would mean a publicly stated guarantee of precisely the nature asked for by the Governor-General two years ago and refused byagreement between the Treasury and the Foreign Office.    The reasons forour refusal at that time were not only the wide repercussions in Colonialcases, but also the danger that any Government, not only an evil intentionedone, might be expected to take the opportunity offered by such a guarantee
to devote its money to more immediately profitable objects, in the knowledge that the pensioners could look to Her Majesty^ Government.    Once that had occurred in the interim period the chances of securing the agreement ofthe successor Government to resume the liability on self-determinationwould be slight.     These reasons apply with equal force at the present time.3. The Foreign Secretary has mentioned the Indian case.    Thatis not a parallel, since the period covered was between the granting of full self-determination and the conclusion of a Financial Agreement;  and because it related only to the Secretary of State&apos;s services, to whom the Secretaryof State had a special responsibility, and Sudanese officials must be held to be more akin to the non-Secretary of State&apos;s services in India.    these points were put at the time by the Foreign Secretary to the Governor-Generaland the latter did not pursue the argument.4. I do not think that there is any great difference between thepresent interim period in the Sudan and that in the Gold Coast.    In both,there is full self-government except that the Governor (and Governor-General)have certain reserve powers including the duty of safeguarding the interestsof the Civil Service.    It is true that in the Gold Coast a written agreement has been obtained from the interim Government to the continued paymentof pensions, whereas the point was not covered in the case of the Sudan inthe corresponding agreement of February 1953,    But the Sudanese PrimeMinister has publicly stated that his Government recognises the obligationto continue pension payments (statement in Sudan Parliament of22nd April, 1954);  if this is not thought sufficient, it is surely not too late to secure now a written agreement with the Sudanese Government similarto that operating in the Gold Coast,
