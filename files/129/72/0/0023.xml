Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1954SECRET Copy No. 6 9C. (54) 3733rd December, 1954CABINETEAST-WEST TRADE: STRATEGIC controls memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI have given further consideration to this topic since our discussion on29th November (C.C. (54) 80th Conclusions, Minute 6), and have had the advantageof discussion with Ministers representing the Departments most affected. TheForeign Secretary is concerned at the damage to Anglo-American political relations which is being caused by the continued differences about the controls on shipping,copper wire and rolling mills.2. I consider that we must accept the Foreign Secretary&apos;s view that somethingmust be done to bring the deadlock to an end, even if it means having to faceconsiderable criticism in this country and in particular criticism from some of ourown supporters. I am, however, anxious that if we are to have a row of this kindit should be one row only and not a series. Let us try to get a comprehensive settlement, even though it may include arrangements distasteful to us, rather thandrag through further months of altercation, disputing among ourselves andsquabbling with the Americans on first one item and then another.3. How unpleasant are the arrangements which we are asked to accept?Briefly they are:  (a) We are asked first to agree to Denmark selling (within a limit) strategicallydangerous ships of a speed which we do not allow our own shipbuildersto sell and which we should under the agreement also bind ourselves notto sell. We are also asked to limit our sales of slower safe ships to thelevel of our weakest competitors, and to accept in addition specially-favourable treatment for the Netherlands. With increased anxiety about shipbuilding orders and the risk of unemployment this is a particularly difficult field in which to make concessions to the Americans.(b) We are asked to embargo bare copper wire altogether very shortly after wehave agreed, as part of a comprehensive settlement with the Americans,to set it free, and moreover to embargo covered copper wire which hasalways been free. The argument that such an embargo (or limitationwith a very low quota) is necessary on strategic grounds is one whichcannot be sustained. The argument that we should agree to embargoor limitation in order to please the Americans, while probably sound initself, is to say the least a dangerous one to advance in the House ofCommons.(c) We are asked to ban exports of rolling mills, equipment which is not in ourview strategic, with a consequent loss of trade valued at something over 30 millions.4. It has been a matter of comment in the press, and has been referred toopenly by the Opposition, that we are under pressure to make concessions on East-West trade to the Americans. Any concession will, therefore, be immediatelyrepresented as a surrender to such pressure and used in certain quarters in anattempt to divide us from our friends.47248
5. I have thought it right to state the worst of the situation which we have to face. Despite the difficulties, I agree with the Foreign Secretary that in theinterests of Anglo-American understanding we must try to meet the Americans.We must, however, try to do so without abandoning altogether the main principles which have so far governed our use of strategic controls, or taking action so hard todefend that it would lead to public outcry against those who were known to have pressed for it.6. I am now ready to sign the Order which will introduce transaction controlearly in January, even though we may be taking this step in advance ofcomplementary action by other countries. This will be a cause of satisfaction tothe Americans and should put them in a better frame of mind, and we should therefore try to get a comprehensive settlement of the remaining items while thereis this improvment in the atmosphere.7. On shipping I would have been prepared to suggest to the Americanssome modification which would make the present proposal less distasteful. ThusI could have suggested an increase in the global quota of 600,000 tons by 100,000,the increase to be divided between the main shipbuilding nations. Alternatively1 could have suggested to the Americans that there should be a reallocation withinthe global quota of 600,000 tons which would have fuller regard to the legitimateclaims of these three countries; or that the American^ recognition that second-hand ships of over twenty years in age should count for only half their tonnagewithin the quota should be extended to allow trade in secondhand ships of lessgreat age, if possible, without their counting against the quota at all. I understand,however, that such modifications would not meet the difficulties with which theMinisters concerned would be faced, and there is no doubt that a further attemptto secure amendments of the American proposal must make the &quot; package &quot; much less acceptable to the Americans.8. On the whole, therefore, it may be that we shall have to accept theAmerican proposal on shipping on the understanding, of course, that it is subject,as the Americans have already offered, to review within twelve months at the latest.9. Having made this concession, or substantially this concession on shipping,we should take a firm line on copper wire, for which we may well in fact secure some worthwhile orders. We ought to tell the Americans that an embargo isunacceptable and we could, while keeping copper wire on List III offer a talkingpoint at 50,000 tons. If exports approved for 1955 reach that figure theCo-ordinating Committee in Paris (COCOM) would discuss the situation afresh.This figure of exports from the whole of Europe to the Soviet bloc compares withan American consumption of copper wire of 600,000 tons a year. A smaller figurethan 50,000 tons on a quota basis would lead to an immediate and bitter argumentinside COCOM as to how the quota should be divided and would arouseconsiderable resentment here.10. On rolling mills, we must get the best compromise that we can. Aproposal for such a compromise is being drawn up by the Ministry of Supply.11. I have had successful negotiations over a wide field with Mr. Stassen,and I consider it essential that we should try to get agreement on the remainingitems.  I accordingly ask for authority to send him the telegram at Annex A.P. T.Board of Trade, S.W.1,2nd December, 1954.
ANNEX ADRAFT TELEGRAM TO WASHINGTONPlease pass immediately following message from President, Board of Trade,to Mr. Stassen. Last summer between us we managed to reach agreement overa larger area of East-West trade controls. I have been concerned by our failure to achieve a final settlement of the questions which were then left outstanding.The most important of these are transit controls, shipping, and rolling mills, and tothese should now be added the problem of copper wire. My colleagues and I feelthat we should make an effort to reach Anglo-American agreement on these atone stroke. Despite our difficulties we are prepared to go a long way to meetyou and I feel confident that you will reciprocate. The main thing is to achieve a comprehensive settlement of all these outstanding difficulties.2. First as to transit controls. I told you that we would introduce transactioncontrols. I have now signed the Order introducing these controls as from january 1955 [in advance of what is being done in Western Europe on the TransitAuthorisation Certificate scheme]. Any delay here has, as you know, been duesimply to the desire, which you share, to bring the rest of Europe with us. Iclaim no credit for carrying out what I consider to be part of my side of the bargain, but the T.A.C. scheme is integral to any attempt to stop the flow of goodsalready on the embargo list and, in our view, strategically far more important thanmarginal adjustments to that list.3. As regards shipping, you are well aware of the great difficulties we foreseein defending to public opinion here a settlement which contains the specialexception in favour of Denmark and confines British shipbuilders to what will berepresented here to be an unreasonably small share of the trade. They had accepted controls imposed for strategic reasons but they will not be able tounderstand why Denmark should be allowed to send strategically dangerous ships or what strategic significance there is in equal quotas between countries with vastlydifferent shipbuilding capacities. I am sure you will agree that harm will be caused to Anglo-American relations by any suggestion that such a situation hadbeen forced upon us. Nevertheless, for the sake of eliminating this source of disagreement between us we are prepared, as part of a general settlement, to acceptthe proposal put forward in the Paris Group in the summer, subject to the following modifications:  (i) There should be prior consultation in the case of Danish ships over15^ knots.(ii) The scheme will be reviewed within twelve months at the latest,[(iii) Any other proposal with regard to shipping.]4. It is my impression that the two questions of transit control and shippingare those to which you have attached most importance but they have presentedgrave difficulties to us and I should find it most difficult to justify our acceptanceunless I could present it to public opinion as part of a satisfactory settlementincluding other outstanding issues.5. As regards copper wire, we have, as you know, published the continuedembargo on copper and copper semis as part of an arrangement under whichcopper wire was put on List III. We cannot in these circumstances accept there-imposition of embargo. There would be very considerable criticism in thiscountry if we were to re-impose it so soon after the item had been freed and assoon as a fair (but in our view not excessive) volume of trade had developed. Wehave, however, sought for some way of meeting you and we shall shortly announce in COCOM our readiness to reconsider the possibility of List II treatment as soonas the global figure of export approvals for 1955 reaches 50,000 tons. this compares with an annual consumption of copper wire of some 600,000 tons in theU.S.A. and 150,000 tons here.6. Finally I must confess to being disappointed by the result of the recentWashington discussions on rolling mills. It seems a pity that, when our views onthe general criteria seemed in the summer to be close enough to secure a satisfactory settlement on other items, there should now be such a wide divergence on this item.
Our industry are aware that the talks are going on and I do not know how much longer we can defend the continuance of embargo over so wide a field. The itemis due to be discussed some time in COCOM but I very much hope that we could atleast narrow our own differences first. To this end I am now sending youa compromise proposal and hope that you will be able to support it in COCOM.7. You will see from the above proposals that we are not hesitating to put the need for a mutual understanding on these issues in front of both our own interests and our pressing domestic difficulties in these matters. You and I havehad to move a long way to meet each other before and I hope we can do so again on this occasion. Above all let us try to reach a comprehensive settlement of theseoutstanding difficulties. To continue to debate them, or for me to announce thatwe are making concessions on them one by one, will exacerbate our difficultieshere and will certainly tend to blur what is I believe the clarity of our commonpurpose.
