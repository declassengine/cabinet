But the corollary to this is thatthe cold or warm war will continue for a long time at its present tempoand may indeed be intensified,30 During the next few years our Colonial Empire in itsvarying stages of development is likely to be a vital &quot;cold war&quot; battleground,,If we are defeated here much of our effort in Western Europe will be wasted,,     Trouble in the Colonial Empire may be directly inspired by the communists,   Alternatively, they may exploit troubles basically of anationalist or other character,,40 As Minister of Defence, my particular interest in the problemarises from the fact that, when trouble breaks out, heavy demands are madeon the Armed Forces0    Malaya, Kenya and British Guiana are a largedrain upon United Kingdom money and manpowers5D Our objective must be to prevent trouble arising,,    It will pay us to spend some money if we can achieve this end0    Moreover, in so faras troubles are Communist inspired, they are centrally directed,,     Ourpreventive action is more likely to succeed if it is centrally co-ordinatedo60 We need good security intelligence, efficient and well-trainedpolice forces and properly organised Colonial armed forces,,7e       . It may well be that we may need a new type of central organisation to assist local effort,80 These are, of course, matters which are primarily theresponsibility of the Colonial Secretary, with whom I have had some preliminary discussions,,    I am8 however^ concerned whether as aGovernment we are giving sufficient thought to the overall problem.
