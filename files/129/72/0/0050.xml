Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1954SECRETC (54) 40020th December, 1954CABINETTHE PRICE OF TEANote by the Prime minister circulate to my colleagues the following interchange of minutes on the priceof tea.W. S. c.10 Downing Street, S.W. I.18th December, 1954.URGENT1. Prime Ministers Personal Minute, Serial No. M 233/54Minister of FoodFinancial Secretary to the TreasuryAttorney-general  am concerned at the rise in the price of tea. This has imposed hardship andeven suffering on the poorer classes particularly the aged. On the other hand, thetea merchants are reported to have made unexampled profits by the rise in prices.Such developments are injurious to the whole policy and reputation of theGovernment on derationing. Is there a monopoly or a ring? If so, there aresurely protectives in the existing law, especially as this is almost a necessity in common use and want. An attempt to make an excess or unfair profit out of a monopoly is certainly indictable.Copy No.
The Attorney-General should let me have a brief account of these ancientpowers. Has the Minister of Food seen the tea merchants? Surely they shouldbe made aware of their danger. The idea that they will be allowed to make excessprofits by exploiting the scarcity of tea should be removed from their minds. Itis also possible that their help may be enlisted if they can show that external causesover which they have no control, such as high prices charged by India, areresponsible. Special measures must be taken to make sure we are not black-mailed unfairly. But even this would not relieve the British tea merchants fromtheir need to explain their own greatly increased and abnormal profits.W. S. C.December 11, 1954.2. To the Prime Minister from the Attorney-GeneralThank you for your Minute with regard to the price of tea.Formerly it was a common law offence to buy any large quantities of wareswith intent to resell them at an unreasonable profit. This was called &quot; engrossing.&quot;This offence was abolished by Act of Parliament in 1844. An agreement which by causing the control of a trade or industry to pass into the hands of an individual or a group of individuals creates a monopoly calculated to enhance prices to an unreasonable extent is illegal in the sense that it is unenforceable in the courtsbut no criminal prosecution can be brought in respect of it.It was in order to remedy the deficiency in our law that the Price of Goods(Control) Act, 1939 was passed. We terminated the operation of the Act in 1953and, as you know, we have now demolished almost all our war time and post warprice controls with the result that now no prosecution will lie for charging an excessive price for tea.I am so sorry to have to send you a reply which is so unhelpful.REGGIE MANNINGHAM-BULLER.3. To the Prime Minister from the Minister of food share your concern about the increase in the price of tea and am keepingclosely in touch with the situation. I will let you have a fuller report shortly inthe meantime you may like to have this interim reply to your minute of11th December.2. Retail prices here reflect the prices which have to be paid for tea in theworld markets. All tea is sold freely at auctions, the principal ones being in Calcutta, Colombo and London; the more insistent the demand at these auctionsthe higher are the prices which are fetched. As a result of a combination of circumstances supplies of tea for consumption in this country have been short and the blenders and packers have been forced to bid higher prices at the auctionsfor what they need.
3. In such conditions the operations of blending, packing and distributingshow little or no profit. The prosperous part of the tea business at present is atthe production end and the high profits recently reported derive from the high prices which the tea plantation owners have received for their tea at the auctions.But it should be borne in mind that the growers of tea lost a great deal of moneyless than two years ago.4. I am satisfied that there is no monopoly or buying ring. There is keencompetition amongst the blenders in this country and it would certainly not bein their interests to form a ring to force up prices. On the contrary, they do betterwhen prices are lower.5. The Governments of the countries in which the tea is grown, particularlyIndia and Ceylon, are not directly responsible for the high prices which tea isfetching at the international auctions. An increase in the quantity of tea put onthe market would of course have its effect, and discreet enquiries are now beingmade to ascertain whether India proposes to increase her export quota.6. The tea trade, at my request, is considering how best to explain the facts of the situation to the general public, and a meeting of the Tea Trade Committee,representative of all the interests concerned, is being held on Wednesday for thispurpose.7. I should perhaps say in conclusion that the high prices for tea have hadpractically no effect so far upon consumption. When the average price of teawas about 4s. Sd. a lb., just after decontrol, consumption was running at 2 - 37 ouncesper head per week; in the first three-quarters of this year, with an average priceof tea at about 5s. Sd., consumption has been running at an average of 2-82 ouncesper head per week : I may add that the corresponding figures for old-age pensionersare 3 - 00 ounces for the earlier period and 3 - 47 ounces for this year.D. HEATHCOAT AMORY.14th December, 1954.4. To the Prime Minister from the Financial Secretary, TreasuryWith reference to your Minute of 11th December about the price of tea,I think you may be interested to see the attached figures of the profits and dividends(on ordinary shares) of a representative sample of tea-producing companies yearby year from 1950 to 1954, based on their annual reports.The figures suggest that the gross profits and ordinary dividends of teacompanies being declared in 1954 are as a whole not much above the level of 1951,though they are very much greater than those reported in 1953, which reflecteda period of slump. These declarations mainly relate to accounting years endingin March, 1954. The rate of earnings in the second, third and fourth quarters of 1954 is almost certainly higher, but will not be known till 1955.One reason for the sharp rise in the price of tea has been the increased buyingby countries outside the Sterling Area, and especially North America.   As the
4175principal producers of tea are Sterling Area countries, the Sterling Area reserveshave benefited from the rise. So it does this amount of good to the Balance ofPayments. I feel that I ought to report that point to you, though I do not forone moment suggest that it is a counterweight to the hardship of high retail prices.I am sending copies of this to the Minister of Food and the Attorney-General.HENRY BROOKE.20th December, 1954.PROFITS AND ORDINARY DIVIDENDS OF TEA COMPANIESNote.
