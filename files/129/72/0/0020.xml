CONFIDENT IAL,C.(54) 3701st December, 1954CABINETSUDAN:  COMPENSATION AND pensions for OFFICIALSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe constitutional changes which are taking place in the Sudanwill involve the withdrawal of the great majority of the British officials.These officials have a claim for compensation for loss of career on a scale varying according to the years they have served.    Her&apos; Majesty&apos;sGovernment have maintained that this claim should be met by the sudan government, and it was left to the Governor-General to negotiate asatisfactory settlement.2.        Under the terms of the self-government statute attached to theAnglo-Egyptian Agreement on the Sudan of February, 1953, the Governor-General has a special responsibility for ensuring fair and equitable treat-ment for all members of the public service.    Acting on this authority, he gave the representatives of the Sudan officials on 6th March last, an assurance that he would not regard as fair any scheme which did not provide for a maximum compensation of  0,750 with a peak factor of4.5.     (The peak factor is roughly the figure by which an officialsannual salary at a certain age is multiplied in order to Calculate hiscompensation.)    These figures were based on comparisons with theGold Coast scheme, which provided the most appropriate model.3.        The Governor-General was obliged to make this statement,because in the uneasy atmosphere of Khartoum immediately after theriots of 1st March, many of the officials, in the absence of any assurance about their future, were contemplating going home.4.        After prolonged negotiations with the Governor-General, the sudanese Parliament passed in July this year a Bill providing for amaximum compensation of  E 8,000 with a peak factor of 4. 0.     TheGovernor-General gave his assent to this Bill because, if he had failedto do so, the whole negotiation would have been jeopardised.    Inparticular, the Sudan Council of Ministers could not have beenbrought to accept a higher figure for compensation without rejecting the important Milner principle, namely that an official who resignsshould have the same right to compensation as an official who isdismissed.    The Governor-General pointed out to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment, however, that the scheme was in some important respectsless satisfactory than the Gold Coast scheme and said that he wouldnot consider that he had fully discharged his duty under the self-government statute unless there was some improvement in thecompensation payable to pensionable officials.
5.        The points on which the Sudan scheme compared unfavourably with the Gold Coast scheme were as follows:-(i)    In the Gold Coast, pensions were to be calculated on the final annual salary as compared with theaverage of the last two years under the Sudanscheme.(ii)    In the Gold Coast, an official would be entitled to hisfull accumulated leave on retirement, comparedwith a maximum of four months under the Sudanscheme.    This meant that the Gold Coastofficials would have a longer period on full pay to look for a job.(iii)   A Gold Coast official could choose the time of hisretirement on compensation, whereas the Sudanofficials could not.6.        The Governor-General has suggested that these shortcomingsin the Sudan scheme could be remedied by additional payments by her majesty&apos;s Government to pensionable officials in the Sudan, who numberabout 250.    He estimates the cost of such additional compensation at 140,000.    He is satisfied that the assumption by Her 2vlajesty&apos;sGovernment of this responsibility would not lead the Sudan Government todefault on their obligations under the compensation law.7.        There is no doubt that the officials have a sense of grievance.This is based on their view that they have been less fairly treated than their colleagues in the Gold Coast, on the assurance which was given tothem by the Governor-General, and on the fact that they were persuaded,on the strength of this assurance, to remain at their posts.    if sir Robert Howe is unable to give them any satisfaction, he will be placedin a very difficult position on his return to the Sudan in a few days&apos; time.The officials&apos; careers are being terminated prematurely and abruptlythrough no fault of their own and it is desirable that they should not leave the Sudan dissatisfied with their treatment. ,8.        I recognise the risk that any additional compensation paid tothe Sudan officials may have repercussions in Colonial territories.    Forthis reason it would be desirable that any addition should be represented,not as a supplement to the compensation scheme negotiated with theSudan Government, but as an ex gratia payment in recognition of the officials&apos; services to Her Majesty&apos;s Government.9.        The officials are also anxious about the payment of their pensions.    They are doubtful of the financial stability of the Sudan andof the willingness and capacity of future Sudan Governments to pay.They are entitled to expect that their pension rights will be safeguardedand this necessarily includes protection against devaluation of theSudan currency.10.       The Governor-General wishes to be authorised to give them, onbehalf of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, an assurance in similar terms tothe assurance which has been given to the members of the colonial service in a recent White Paper (Colonial No. 306).    This assurance
would state that it is the intention of Her MajestyTs Government to securesafeguards about pensions in a formal agreement to be entered into withthe Sudan Government at the time when the latter exercises self-determination.    Sir Robert Howe has also asked that the officials&apos;pensions should be guaranteed by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the interim period until this agreement has been concluded.    In the Sudan,the effective transfer of power has already been made.    The interim period before self-determination may last for three years or more and,if during that time the Sudan Government default, there is nothing thatthe Governor-General can do about it.     There is a precedent for an interim guarantee of pensions in the case of India, where the position was similar.Conclusions11.       I ask the Cabinet to agree  -(1)   That additional compensation should be paid by Her Majesty!sGovernment to pensionable officials in the Sudan to bring their compensation up to the amount considered fair and equitable by the Governor-General.(2)  That Sir Robert Howe should be authorised to give the officials, on behalf of Her majesty&apos;s Government, an assurance about pensions on the lines of the attached draft.A.E.Foreign Office, S. W.l.30th November, 1954.
PROPOSED FORM OF ASSURANCE ON pensions to BE GIVEN BY HER MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTHis Excellency the Governor-General has had discussions with her Majesty&apos;s Government regarding the payment of pensions of past and present British members of the Sudan Civil Service, and their dependants.Her Majesty&apos;s Government are well aware of their anxietiesin this matter, and recognise their obligation towards officials who holdor held their posts as a result of having been appointed to them by theGovernor-General during the period of the Condominium.    Theseofficials are entitled to expect that the pensions and other benefits forwhich they and their dependants may be qualified under existing laws and regulations shall be safeguarded, and that these pensions willcontinue to be paid at their present value in sterling.Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom accordinglymake known their intention, when the Sudan determines its future status,to ensure observance of this safeguard by securing its embodiment ina formal agreement to be entered into between Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and the Government of the Sudan.    This agreement will providefor the payment of pensions to officials and their dependants under existing laws and regulations, convertible at the present rate ofexchange.Those concerned have the assurance of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment that, pending the conclusion of this agreement, they will receive the pensions to which they are entitled.
