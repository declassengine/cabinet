(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCu(54) 351 COPY NO.  i--^ZOth November, 1954CABINETTOBACCO TOKENSMemoranclum by the Chancellor of the exchequer have agreed to the proposal of tlie IVlinistar of Pensions and national Insurance for a very large increase in the retirement pension,and I have, therefore, considered whether it would be possible to take this opportunity of modifying the Tobacco Duty Relief Scheme.     Thisscheme was introduced in 1947 following the sharp increase in therate of duty on imported tobacco.     This was a deliberate act-of policydesigned to curtail the consumption of tobacco in order to save dollars;it was considered that consumption of tobacco by old-age pensionerswas already restricted by their income and that the increase in price would, therefore, impose an unreasonable burden on them.2.        Provision was therefore made to enable specified categories of old-age pensioners who certify that they are habitual smokers toobtain coupons which enable them to buy tobacco at a cheaper price.The coupon is at present worth 2/4-d. a week.     The scheme is verydifficult to administer.     This has been recognised by members of all parties-.    There is also a good deal of feeling that the smoking old-agepensioner has better benefits than the non-smoking old-age pensioner.Moreover, there is constant pressure to make similar concessions forother commodities, such as tea, milk, coal, eggs and sweets.3. The loss of duty is about  14 millions a year, although onlyone-half of the eligible pensioners make use of the concession.     Thecost of the concession grov/s as the number of pensioners grows.    TheExchequer is assuming such great liabilities for the future in theMinister&apos;s proposals that I must take the opportunity to limit thefuture commitment in tobacco tokens.4.        It would not, I think, be practical politics to withdraw thescheme altogether.    I have considered whether we could make adjust-ments in the scheme since the money involved is considerable.     I willdescribe such adjustments if desired.5.        But on the whole I think we should, as part of this operation,confine the token scheme to existing pensioners.    This would not involve withdrawing benefits which are already being granted.     Personsnow reaching pension age have become used to the present prices of tobacco, and have adjusted their habits accordingly.
6. The change can be made by regulation, subject to annulmentby Negative Resolution.I therefore recommend that:-(a)   we make a regulation providing that no tokens wouldbe issued to persons reaching pension age after,say, 1st May, 1955;(b)  this be announced as an integral part of the pension and national insurance plan0Treasury Chambers.
