(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(54) 391 COPY NO.   LB14th December, 1954CABINETJAPAN AND THE GENERAL, AGREEMENT on tariffs AND trade memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in accordance with a decision taken by the Cabinet on 20th October(C. C, (54) 68th Conclusions, Minute 8) the President of the Board of Trade&apos;sproposals about the accession of Japan to the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) were communicated to the Japanese and United states government,2.        The Japanese reply of 30th November rejected our proposals onthe grounds that the amendment to the G.A. T. T. which they envisagedwould discriminate against Japan and might result in her having to enterinto bilateral agreements with all existing members of the G.A.T.T.3.        We have as yet had no official reaction from the United StatesGovernment but we know that they are opposed to our proposal on thegrounds that it would compromise the integrity of the G.A.T.T.    Moreover,I understand that the unofficial reactions of other delegations at Genevado not suggest that a majority is likely to be forthcoming in G.A.T.T.for it.4.        In these circumstances it may be helpful to my colleagues to havean up-to-date assessment of the political situation in Japan in its bearing on this problem.5.        The Government of Mr, Yoshida, which kept Japan aligned withthe West, has just been replaced by a caretaker Government.    The new government is headed by Mr. Hatoyama, who is anti-American and was an open admirer of Hitler and Mussolini.    He has the temporary backingof the -two Socialist Parties who are anxious to take Japan out of theWestern camp.    His other followers are only united in the pursuit of power.    There is little hope of a stable Japanese Government for sometime to come.6.        Democratic institutions in Japan have been brought into contemptby recent scandals.    The hysterical Japanese reaction to the recenthydrogen bomb experiments underlines the extent of anti-American and anti-Western feeling in Japan.    At the same time the Soviet Union and china are offering more and more inducements to Japan to change herallegiance.    In these circumstances a period of unstable Governmentcould lead to the breakdown of Parliamentary Government and to theestablishment of a new dictatorship in Japan of the extreme left or possibly of the extreme right.    In the former case Japan would, of course,be lost to the West.    In the latter case she would at best be a veryunreliable member in the Western camp.
7.        These were the dangers which the Cabinet had in mind when they approved, last March, my memorandum C. (54) 92 about our policy towardsJapan (C.C.(54) 22nd Conclusions, Minute 7).    This paper affirmed thatthe cardinal aim of our policy in the Far East must be to prevent Chinese/Japanese association by bolstering Western influence and proving to theJapanese that it is in their interest to co-operate with the West.Mr. Hatoyama and his supporters will be much more difficult to convinceof this than was Mr. Yoshida.8.        In these circumstances I am impressed by the political and strategic dangers of invoking Article XXXV of the G.A. T.T. against japan and refusing to accept G.A.T.T. obligations towards her.    In assessing theconsequences of such action on our part H. M. Ambassador in Tokyo has stated (Tokyo telegram No. 715 - Annex A) that:-&quot;In Japanese eyes we should be regarded as havingdeliberately excluded Japan from the comity of nations and,even worse, as having publicly humilated a nation still badlyafflicted with a defeat complex. &quot;I fully endorse this view.9.        H. M. Ambassador at Washington (Washington telegram No. 2680 -Annex B) has drawn attention to the serious effect of a decision to invoke article XXXV upon American opinion and our trading prospects in theUnited States market.    He considers that this question is not only ofcrucial importance for Anglo-Japanese relations but of major importance for Anglo-American relations as well.    I share this opinion also.10.       In his memorandum C. (54) 268 of 10th August, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer said that if our proposal failed we might &quot;have to examinean alternative scheme which would give us less protection&quot;.    i accordingly invite my colleagues -(a) to agree that the proposals approved by the Cabineton 20th October should not be pressed further;(b) to agree that we can not invoke Article XXXV of theG.A.T.T. against Japan; and(c) to instruct officials to consider and submit alternative proposals within the framework of the G.A.T,T.which would go as far as possible to meet Britishindustries1 fears of Japanese competition.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.I.13th December, 1954.
ANNEX from Tokyo to Foreign office sir B. DeningNo. 7156th December, 1954Japan and the G.A.T.T.The late Japanese Government having formally rejected ourcompromise proposals and suggested the negotiation of a commercial treaty, and there being no present reasons to suppose that any new Govern-ment will take a substantially different attitude, it seems opportune to review the position we have now reached.2.        The Japanese official reply is intended to be conciliatory and toencourage us to further efforts.    At present the Japanese are trying,within limits, to remove all our legitimate grievances and the Press hascarefully refrained from expressing animosity about our attitude.    Thereason for this is that the Japanese still hope that when faced with the choice we shall not invoke Article 35.    That this is their present feeling was abundantly confirmed during the visit of the Parliamentary delegationlast week.3.        We should not, I think, allow ourselves to deduce from what theJapanese Minister said in London and what Asakai said both there and here,that the Japanese would not mind our invoking Article 35 of the G.A.T.T.(in any case these two cannot be said to represent Japanese publicopinion).    What they mean is that it would be the lesser evil for Japanif we were to invoke Article 35 than for us to set the example for othercountries to exercise discrimination against Japan, as they think ourcompromise proposals would have done.    Though, from the Japanesepoint of view this is no doubt correct, that is quite a different thing fromsaying that Japan would not mind our invoking Article 35.    It is truethat Asakai, who is better acquainted with the background of our thinkingthan most Japanese and who probably fears that in spite of everythingwe may invoke Article 35, has suggested that we negotiate a commercial treaty after doing so.    But again he is not saying that Japan would notmind, and I suspect his real thought to be that we should be shamed by ourconduct in invoking Article 35 into concluding a treaty more favourable to Japan than the alternative we proposed.    As far as I am aware that isnot at all what we have in mind.4.        That invoking Article 35 will create odium and will impairAnglo-Japanese relations I am in no doubt whatever.    It must convey to the Japanese, however much we may try to cover up our action, thatwe regard Japanese trading methods as disqualifying Japan from membership of an international body of which many other less efficient and less reputable countries are members.    I would not expect a violentreaction, but I think it would nevertheless be profound.    In Japaneseeyes we should be regarded as having deliberately excluded Japan fromthe comity of nations and, even worse, as having publicly humiliated a nation still badly afflicted with a defeat complex.    Having demonstrated that we do not trust them, the Japanese will see no further purpose in
conciliating us, and such influence as we possess may be expected tovanish.    Nor will there be any reason for the Japanese to abandon themethods of competition which we so dislike.    I do not say that they wouldnot negotiate a commercial treaty, but to Japan it would be strictly amariage de convenance and we should be likely to find that administrativepassive resistance tended to nullify any benefits we might hope for fromits provisions.5.        We are in fact entering upon a crucial period in our relationship with Japan which is comparable with the time when we denounced theAnglo-Japanese Alliance in 1922.    If we trust her we are taking certainrisks which Her Majesty&apos;s Government may not be prepared to contemplate, though I would doubt whether in sum total they would reallybe so disastrous to our economy.    If, on the other hand, we intend to demonstrate publicly that we do not trust Japan and decline to treather as we treat others, then we must accept that we are breedingresentment and enmity, and this at a time when Russia and China areoffering more and more inducements to Japan to change her course.We shall in fact be acting contrary to the policy we have already decidedof trying to keep Japan away from China.ANNEX BFrom Washington to Foreign OfficfeSir R. MakinsNo. 268010th December, 1954Tokyo telegram No. 715;   Japan and the G.A.T.T.In view of the American interest in this question you may wishto have comments from me on Sir E. Deningls important telegram.&apos;2.       Neither Mr. Dulles nor his officials have made any response to the approach which I reported in my telegram No. 2379.    If wepressed for an answer, I am sure that the reply would be that this is primarily a matter for the Japanese Government and that, if they are unwilling to accept our compromise proposal (which the State department in any case do not like), the United States Government cannot press themto agree to it.3.        A member of my staff had been told unofficially by the state department that there have been no recent developments as regards theAmerican counter-proposal which was discussed here at the end ofSeptember.    I understand that this counter-proposal was mentioned tothe Japanese early in October, and that they did not at that time rejectit.    The State Department propose to review their position on thisquestion during the Christmas recess in the G.A.T.T. session, and will then consider whether they should put their counter-proposal forward.They are aware that the Japanese have, in effect, rejected ourcompromise proposal.
4.        The problem is not at all easy for the Americans.    On the onehand, they are firmly opposed to our proposal, because it appears to themto give Japan second-class status in G.A.T.T. and because it is, in their view, potentially disruptive to the whole G.A.T.T. structure.    On the otherhand, although the invocation of Article XXXV by the United Kingdom and anumber of other countries would not involve the G.A.T.T, policy objections which were emphasised during the September discussions, it would most certainly create acute political difficulties here.5.        The United States Government and public opinion in this country are bound to be deeply impressed by the broad political considerations to which Sir E. Dening calls attention in the final paragraph of his telegram under reference.     The administration have repeatedlyemphasised to us at the highest levels their concern about these issues.A decision by the United Kingdom to invoke Article XXXV could not therefore fail to cause acute disappointment to the administration, eventhough we have made it clear that this course might be the only alternative to our compromise proposal.6.        Moreover, the administration would certainly feel with justificationthat our action had added to their difficulty in securing broad public andCongressional support for the Presidents foreign economic policyproposals.    For many people in this country (even outside the firmlyentrenched body of convinced protectionists) Japanese competition is merely one aspect of import competition generally.    If we appear to betaking the position that we must have special protection against the forms of import competition which hurt us most, these critics of the presidents programme will not be slow to argue that the United states should enjoy similar protection in those fields where the United Stateseconomy is most sensitive to import competition.7.        Our friends in the administration feel sincerely and in my viewrightly that in resisting the domestic pressures in this country which are opposed to trade concessions to Japan, they are serving the best interestsof other countries, whose exports to this market appear to threaten theinterests of domestic manufacturers.    But they cannot hope to hold thepresent line, still less make some advance towards more liberal policies,if other important trading countries (particularly the United Kingdom) canbe represented as being unwilling to take risks also.    Finally, theprospects of Congressional approval of the G.A.T.T. next year must be seriously diminished if the administration have to admit that at least onemajor country which has undoubtedly derived advantages from the agree-ment (not least in the American market) has &quot;contracted out&quot; in relationto the country which presents the most acute problem of importcompetition.8.        I am not under-estimating the political difficulties of this issueat home,    I do, however, most strongly urge that the effects of a decisionto invoke Article XXXV on opinion in this country, and upon our tradingprospects in this market, should be earnestly weighed.    Sir E. Deningshows that the issue is crucial for Anglo-Japanese relations, but it hasmajor importance for Anglo-American relations as well.
