(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT)secret.(54) 36729th November, 1954ij   FORMOSA AND THE COASTAL ISLANDSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsIvly colleagues are aware that the United States Governmentand the Chinese Nationalist authorities initialled a mutual defence treaty and exchange of letters last week.     They have agreed upon a jointannouncements    This was to have been issued on 30th November but wehave asked that it be postponed.    The texts of the treaty documents willprobably not be published until later.    The text of the joint announcementis annexed.2. The Americans have been told that the draft statement in itspresent form is unsatisfactory and would not permit us to agree to theproposed Security Council operation.3. It seems unlikely that it will now be possible for the Americanssubstantially to amend the statement or the treaty documents.     We should therefore consider whether, on the basis of the information we now have, weshould agree to proceed with the Security Council operation.4. The arguments in favour of proceeding appear to beas follows:-(a) We want to stop the fighting and prevent furtheroutbreaks.     If the question is put to the Security Councilit would make it more difficult for the chinese communists to launch an attack without exposingthemselves to accusations  of being an aggressor.(b) If these islands can be made the responsibility ofthe United Nations, the United States Government mayin due course be led to regard the Chinese Nationalistssolely as the Government of Formosa.    This mightpave the way to a more realistic United States policyin the Far East and to the ultimate recognition of Peking.(c) If we could reach agreement with the United StatesGovernment on policy towards China it would remove. one of the main causes of friction between us.(d) If we do not proceed and the Communists attack and the United States becomes involved we shall wishto stand aloof.    But the Americans would be bitterlyresentful if we stood aside.    In any case we might bedrawn in.    We should be criticised if we had not takenall possible steps, including reference to the united nations before the event, to avert hostilities.-1- IICOPY NO.CABINET
5.The arguments against appear to be:-(a) The United States treaty with Chiang Kai-shekin its present form does not meet the two requirementsthat we have considered indispensable to the security council operation viz. that Formosa should not be a&quot;privileged sanctuary&quot; for attacks against the mainlandand that the United States should in no circumstances be committed to action in defence of the coastal islands.(b) These islands are useless militarily but they are soclose to the mainland as to be a constant provocation.The Security Council operation in present circumstances will tend to confirm Chiang Kai-shekls possession of themand to give him an international guarantee, instead of ensuring his removal from them as was the original intention.    It might involve the United Nations in supportof purely United States policies towards Chiang Kai-shek.(c) If the resolution is vetoed in the Security council the Chinese Communists may be encouraged to attack.(d) The matter having once come before the united nations there would be strong pressure from the UnitedStates to refer the matter to the Assembly, and call for collective measures against China.     It would be difficult for us not to support such proposals without causing asei-ious Anglo-American rift;  if we did support them wewould meet strong opposition from India and other AsianStates.     There would be little support in the world for united Nations police action over Quemoy.(e) The operation would now hold no inducement to theChinese Communists to co-operate.     They would simplybe denied the islands which they hope to take.(f) It would be difficult to confine discussion in the Councilsimply to the islands.      Formosa and wider issues wouldbe bound to come up and we might find ourselves led intodifferences with the United States Government.(g) We might be able to achieve more by keeping uppressure, both confidentially and in public, on theCommunist Chinese and the Soviet Union to refrain fromviolent action.(h) The Chinese condemnation of the United States airmenhas created so much indignation in the United Statesthat it would now be difficult to prevent the Security Councilaction from appearing as simply a cold war propagandaexercise, which would be the reverse of what we originally intended.recommendation. I recommend that as matters stand at present and unless thereare very considerable changes in the United States position we should not agree to proceed with the Security Council operation.A .E,Foreign Office, S.W01.29th November, 1954.-2-
annex draft JOINT statement the United States of America and the Republic of Chinahave concluded negotiations for a mutual security pact.     The treaty will follow the general pattern of other security pacts which Hie UnitedStates of America has concluded in the Western Pacific.The treaty will recognise the common interest of theparties in the security of Taiwan and the Pescadores and of the western pacific islands under the jurisdiction of the United States.     It will providefor inclusion by agreement of other territories under the jurisdiction ofthe parties.    It is directed against threats to the security of the treatyareas.from armed attack and provides for continuing consultationregarding any such threat or attack.This treaty will forge another link in the system of collective security established by the treaties concluded between the United Statesand the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand, the Republic of Korea,and Japan, and by the Manila Pact covering certain areas in South east asia.    Together, these arrangements provide the essential framework for the defence by the free peoples of the Western Pacific againstCommunist aggression.Like the other treaties, this treaty between the UnitedStates and the Republic of China will be defensive in character.     It willre-affirm the dedication of the parties to the purposes and principles ofthe Charter of the United Nations.
