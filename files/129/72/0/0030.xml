SUDAN: FUTURE OF THE GOVERNOR-GENERALSHIPMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs have been informed by Sir Robert Howe, the Governor-General of theSudan, that for personal reasons, which I fear are compelling, he feels that he mustoffer his resignation in the early part of next year.2. It might have been possible to ask him to reconsider his decision had itbeen likely that the Sudanese would take a decision about their future during thecoming year. That, however, is not now expected to happen. The position is thatthe present Sudanese Parliament must set the constitutional processes in motion bypassing a resolution expressing their desire for self-determination. That resolution is unlikely to be passed before November 1955. After its passage three monthsmust elapse for the withdrawal of foreign troops. A draft electoral law for theConstituent Assembly has to be drawn up and submitted to the SudaneseParliament; a new international body to supervise the elections for the ConstituentAssembly must be set up and must make arrangements for carrying out its task;and the Constituent Assembly has then to be elected and assembled. TheConstituent Assembly could hardly be elected and brought together in Khartoumbefore 1st April, 1956, at the earliest. If it were not elected by then, the electionswould have to wait until the autumn of 1956, after the summer rains.3. The Constituent Assembly has to decide the future of the Sudan and,having made its decision, to draw up a new Constitution. After that, electionshave to be held for the &quot; permanent &quot; Sudanese Parliament, and that could notbe done until the autumn of 1956 at the earliest, on the assumption that theConstituent Assembly would have met by April of that year. Until a new Headof State has been chosen, pursuant to whatever provision is made in the newConstitution, the Governor-General remains, under the Self-Government Statute,the supreme constitutional authority in the Sudan. It follows, therefore, that inall probabilitj&apos; there must be a Governor-General in the Sudan for at least twoyears from now, and indeed possibly for longer, since Constitution-making canbe a long process.4. It will be necessary to discuss the appointment of a new Governor-general with the Egyptian Government, since the normal procedure, which the egyptian government appear still to recognise, is that nominations for the Governor-Generalship are made by Her Majesty&apos;s Government and approved by theEgyptian Government. It is obviously desirable that the new Governor-general should also be British, and there have been some indications that the egyptian government might be prepared to agree. If they were not to agree, we mighthave to try for a neutral.5. As a first step I discussed the question with the Sudanese Prime Ministerduring his recent visit to this country, on the basis that Sir Robert Howe might possibly be unable to carry on very much longer as Governor-General. the sudanese Prime Minister was clearly unwilling to commit himself to any particularview, other than that the problem ought not to present too many difficulties withthe Egyptians in view of the improvement in Anglo-Egyptian relations.Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1954\        Ni.,.:-.^-&apos;&quot;V V I /  CONFIDENTIAL V-A Copy No.     7C. (54) 3807th December, 1954CABINET
6. There is a time factor in any discussion of the subject with the egyptian government. British technical officials in the Sudan have the right to choose on1st January, 1955, whether they will remain in the Sudan or leave after 1st July,1955. Sir Robert Howe wishes to make his own intentions known before 1st January, since that may affect the choice which some of them make. It isclearly necessary that an approach should be made to the Egyptian government before Sir Robert Howe announces his intentions. Her Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affairesat Cairo has accordingly been instructed to raise the matter tentatively with theEgyptian Government to test their reactions.recommendation. That the Cabinet approve the continuance of discussions with the egyptian government with fhe object of securing the appointment of another BritishGovernor-General.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,6th December, 1954.
