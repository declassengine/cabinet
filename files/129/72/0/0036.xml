HoCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNiviEN&apos;^^bI CONFIDENTIAL^| C.(54) 386 COPY NO. 5l13th December, 1954CABINETflH PUBLICITY FOR THE TREATMENT OF BRITISHPRXSONERS-OF-WAR IN KOREA BY THE COMMUNISTSMemorandum by the Attorney-GeneralWith regard to the memorandum by the Minister of Defence(C. (54) 303), the Solicitor-General and I consider that Chapters VI andVII contain many defamatory, indeed highly defamatory, passages inrelation to the individuals named therein*2. Consequently, unless the publication is the subject of absoluteprivilege, any of the named persons could start an action for libel againstthe Crown and the Attorney-General would probably find himself Defendantto such proceedings.3. While we do not doubt that these defamatory statements are wellmerited, we do not know what evidence is available and would be availablewhen such an action came on for trial and consequently we cannot say whatprospects there are that the defence would succeed on a plea of justificationor fair comment.4. It is, we think, very doubtful indeed whether the Courts wouldhold that the publication of such defamatory matter to the public at largewas the subject of qualified privilege.    If it were so held then, havingregard to the way in which the draft is written, and the omission to nameany soldiers who collaborated while naming these civilians, we think itlikely that it would be held that there was malice in which case a defencebased on a plea of qualified privilege would fail.5. If the action for libel succeeded, the damages might be verysubstantial indeed as the innuendo clearly is that these named civilianswere guilty of conduct akin to treason.6. If this draft was published in such a way that the ParliamentaryPapers Act, 1840, applied to it, that is to say publication by order of theHouse, then on the Speaker or the Clerk of the House certifying that itwas so published, any proceedings in respect of the publication whethercivil or criminal could be stayed.    Further, any publication of a copyof the draft, provided it was a correct copy, would be similarly protected*7. If the draft was published by order of the House, then publicationof an extract from it or an abstract of it would be protected if publishedbona fide and without malice.mmm &quot;l&quot; mmm
C.       Having regard to the consequences that might otherwise ensue, we ^^^flfeel that, if this draft is published, it should be published by order of the ^^^h! House and so obtain the protection given by the Parliamentary Papers9*       If it is published in this fashion, those named and their fellow ^^^1travellers may complain that publication of highly defamatory libels in a ^^^h1 paper so protected is really an abuse of Parliamentary procedure andthat those named are being condemned in the public eye for conduct akin tohigh treason without a trial and without any opportunity of clearing theirnames and reputations; and those who condemn the conduct of thesecivilians may demand to know why they have not been tried.10. My predecessors have from time to time seriously considered the ^^^binstitution of proceedings against three of the persons named in Chapter VI &quot;^^^hI namely, Alan Winnington, Mrs. Felton and Jack Gaster, all of whom have ^^^Jbeen the subject of Questions in the House.    In the case of Monica Feltonand Jack Gaster, it was decided that no criminal proceedings would lie.In the case of Alan Winningtons however, the view taken was that, whileWinnington&apos;s propaganda activities! might well be treasonable, a difficulty ^^^Bin the way of proceedings for that crime was that death was the onlypenalty.    I must add, though, that the question whether the English lawof treason applies to the operations in Korea is, in fact, by no means freefrom doubt.11. Publications of Chapters VI and VII in their present form mayJ well lead to a revival of the demand for legislation to make conduct of thiskind more readily punishable in future.    This question too has beencarefully considered in the past, but it has been found fraught withdifficulty.    Indeed, the Home Secretary announced in July, 1952 that theV^H Government were not satisfied that the present circumstances requiredany amendment of the existing laws,j 12.      If this draft is published by order of the House, could notChapters VI and VII be re-written so as to reduce the risk that we shallbe accused of abusing Parliamentary procedure, etc. ?    It would not seemimpossible to reduce their defamatory content without depriving them oftheir point.    Could not the line be that the public should be made awareV^H of the use made by the Chinese and the North Koreans of visits by civiliansto the prisoner-of-war camps, and the consequences of such visits toBritish prisoners-of-war, without suggesting that these named visitorsj connived in the use to which their visits were put and were aware of theconsequences to certain British prisoners} that they were ignorant idiotsrather than traitorous?RJS.M. -B.Law Officers&apos; Department, W.
