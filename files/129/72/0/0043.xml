Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1954SECRETC. (54) 39315th December, 1954CABINETNEW COLONIAL OFFICE building memorandum by the Prime minister on present plans, work will soon begin on the site of the old WestminsterHospital. But it might one day be possible for the whole of the area from theCentral Hall to the Houses of Parliament, and from Great George Street to westminster Abbey, to be cleared of buildings. Then a great square could belaid out as a truly noble setting for the heart of the British Empire. The costno doubt would be heavy, but it would be spread over many years, perhaps evengenerations. I consider that we should not prejudice this magnificent prospectby erecting an obstacle to it which might last for centuries.2. I remember that there was a lot of public criticism of the proposal tobuild the Colonial Office here when the Labour Government announced it, andthat there was opposition from representatives of all Parties in the House. I donot propose that a final decision should be taken now, but I consider that buildingthe Colonial Office opposite the Abbey should be postponed for a few years.3. Meanwhile, the palisade should be pulled down so that the public could see for the first time what possibilities the site presents. It could be covered overwith grass or treated in some other simple way which would not affect the useof the fortress accommodation underneath. The Middlesex Guildhall was designed for an island site and something could doubtless be done to improve the rear view of the existing George Street buildings without great expense. In anycase they will come down in time and therefore add to the size of the site or bereplaced by something more presentable.W. S. C.10, Downing Street, S.W. 114th December, 1954.Copy No. 6 5
