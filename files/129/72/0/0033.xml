North Korea invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950.Chinese ground forces entered the war on October 20, 1950.Armistice negotiations began on July 10, 1951.32 British sick and wounded were released in April, 1953.Armistice was signed and cease fire came into effect on July 27, 1953.946 more British prisoners were released by early September, 1953.One British prisoner elected to remain in North Korea.
INTRODUCTIONThis is the story of the 978 British soldiers taken prisoner in Korea and heldin camps along the banks of the Yalu River, which separates North Korea and china. The story has been compiled from the experiences of all the prisoners asthey related them on their return to freedom; in telling the story it is necessaryto generalise, as all the prisoners did not have identical experiences, but the pattern of their lives was the same wherever they were.Although the number of British soldiers with whom this story deals is small,their experiences were of great importance because they were the first British troops to be held captive by a Communist country. Consequently when the british prisoners returned from Korea during 1953 (the first, released under the terms ofan agreement for the exchange of sick and wounded, in April, and the rest, releasedunder the Armistice Agreement, in September) everyone was intensely interested to know how they had been treated. The answers supplied by the prisonersthemselves were, however, confusing and bewildering; some said their captors hadbeen kind and generous while others spoke of compulsory political lectures or ofbrutal torture.This confusion was partly dispelled when it became apparent that the Chinesehad been careful to include among the first prisoners to be released several whosepolitical sympathies had been inclined towards Communism and who would there-fore praise Chinese behaviour. On the whole the anti-Communist prisoners were freed later. But even this knowledge did not entirely remove doubt about what really happened in the Korean prisoner-of-war camps; only a full explanation of the tactics adopted by the Chinese can dispel this doubt, and this full explanationcould not be written until the stories of all the prisoners in Korea had been examined.
CHAPTER ITHE &quot;LENIENT POLICY&quot;Armed warfare started in Korea in June 1950. Four months later the entry of Chinese troops into the war not only made the fighting fiercer but brought toits full pitch the conflict of ideologies. It was the prison camps set up by theChinese and North Koreans that became the battleground for this war of minds.British troops of the United Nations Forces who fell into enemy hands found thatfor them the battle with Communism had not ended when they were captured.The British prisoners were unprepared for this ordeal. They had expectedhardship if they were captured; they foresaw rough, even brutal, treatment. Butthey did not think of themselves as students of politics under the tutelage of their,mostly Chinese, Communist guards. In past wars those who have capturedBritish soldiers have not concerned themselves with the politics of their prisoners.The United Nations prisoners in Korea soon learned, however, that their treatment as prisoners-of-war depended upon how far their political convictions pleased theircaptors.It gradually became clear that the Chinese aimed to convert at least a minorityi of prisoners to Communism and then to use this minority to undermine theconfidence of the remainder, thus rendering them in turn susceptible to Communistindoctrination. This aim was embodied in what the Chinese called their &quot; LenientPolicy &quot; towards prisoners-of-war. It was based on the lie that the war in Koreawas one of American aggression and part of the conspiracy of the capitalist worldagainst peace. The Chinese claimed that all United Nations prisoners taking partin this unjust war were war criminals, and that if they were captured their captorshad the right to kill them. But, the Chinese argument went on, the soldiers ofthe &quot; aggressors &quot; were, after all, ordinary working men who had been dupedand misled by their reactionary rulers. Therefore prisoners would not besummarily executed (hence the &quot; leniency &quot;) but would be given the opportunityto reach a state of remorse and repentance for their crimes.&apos;:Thus the Chinese allowed themselves to claim that, whether conditions in the prison camps were good or bad by normal standards, they were treating theirprisoners generously and well far better, in fact, than they deserved or were entitled to expect. During the early months of Chinese intervention their claimto treat prisoners well was quite untrue. At first the Chinese, like the NorthKoreans, had no proper facilities for handling prisoners and the first permanentprisoner-of-war camp at Pyoktong (Camp 5) was not established until January1951. Between then and August of that year food, shelter and medical attentionwere so inadequate that more than 1,600 United Nations prisoners were reportedto have died in Chinese hands. Even in these conditions, and perhaps as a resultof them, the Chinese were able to extort propaganda material from the prisonersfor dissemination to the outside world. By the time the peace talks started in June1951 the Chinese had taken to expressing concern over the welfare of prisoners.Many of the prisoners made statements praising the generous and almost luxurioustreatment which they were receiving, and (according to their Chinese captors) theconditions of prisoners in the camps were at least as good as those enjoyed by thelocal population and the Chinese troops themselves.So far as the major camps were concerned this claim was substantially truefrom late 1951, but supplies of food and medicine and standards of accommodationstill depended to a large extent on the degree of co-operation with their captorswhich the prisoners showed. In addition the Chinese used physical violence,solitary confinement and other &quot; incentives &quot; to persuade prisoners to co-operate with them. This discrimination they justified by arguing that prisoners were onlyentitled to the full benefits of the &quot; Lenient Policy &quot; if they accepted and observedcertain rules and regulations, particularly those dealing with &quot; re-education.&quot; Untilthe end of 1951 &quot;re-education &quot; was compulsory in all camps, but then, after ayear&apos;s experience in handling Western prisoners, the Chinese gradually abandonedcompulsory re-education in favour of more subtle techniques. The principle of compulsory study was, however, fundamental to the &quot; Lenient Policy &quot; as originallyformulated.This theory was based on certain assumptions, namely: that the Communistshad a monopoly of the truth; that the prisoners accepted that they had been dupesof their capitalist rulers; that they were willing to learn the &quot; truth &quot;; and that theywelcomed their &quot; liberation &quot; by the Chinese.
If a prisoner would not accept these assumptions the Chinese considered thathe was not entitled to the benefits of the &quot; Lenient Policy.&quot; They argued that any reasonable man will accept the chance of improving his education and, since the&quot; truth &quot; must be obvious once the veils of &quot; capitalist propaganda &quot; have been removed, a refusal to see the light could be due only to malice. If a prisonerrefused to be educated and to see the &quot; truth,&quot; he was voluntarily aligning himself with the forces of reactionary capitalism and imperialism and with the enemiesof ordinary men and women throughout the world. He was therefore a criminal,outside the protection of the &quot; Lenient Policy,&quot; and the treatment he received in consequence was his own responsibility. This view was expressed in its crudestform in early 1951 at Pyoktong by a Chinese officer who became famous amongthe prisoners for his remark that &quot; we will keep you here 10, 20, 30 or even 40 yearsif necessary, until you learn the truth, and if you still won&apos;t learn it, we will buryyou so deep that you won&apos;t even stink.&quot;By late 1951, however, the Communist propaganda was repeatedly claiming that all the Chinese were doing was offering their prisoners the opportunity to learn the truth; there was no obligation to accept it and punishment was not metedout to prisoners for holding opinions which differed from those of their instructors(nor even for expressing those opinions publicly), but only for &quot; reactionary &quot;activity. But since the Chinese continued to regard the expression of anti-Communist opinions as a reactionary activity, as an attempt to influence others,as a slander of the Chinese forces, or as evidence of a &quot; hostile &quot; attitude, it was clear that the opinions of prisoners had to be &quot; progressive &quot; if they were to gounpunished.It was a natural accompaniment to this policy to classify prisoners accordingto their political convictions and to treat the &quot; progressives &quot; better than the&quot; reactionaries.&quot; The &quot; progressive &quot; prisoner was the one who accepted thepolitical economy and social gospel of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin even ifhe was not quite sure what this was. In order to be fully accepted as a&quot; progressive,&quot; however, the prisoner had to do more than passively acceptCommunism. He must become a Communist propagandist and assist the Chinese,not only by giving them all the military information which he had, but also byacting as an informer, revealing the plans and thoughts of his fellow prisoners,and helping to spread Communism among them and among his family and friendsat home. Thus he would show that he had become &quot; politically conscious.&quot;Prisoners who did not co-operate in any of these ways were classed as&quot; reactionaries &quot; and regarded as criminals not entitled to the mercy of the &quot; LenientPolicy.&quot;In order to assist his classification as a &quot; progressive &quot; or &quot; reactionary &quot; the prisoner had, at frequent interviews, to complete questionnaires designed to give his captors a greater insight into his background and character. He was also made to commit himself to paper, usually in the form of &quot; self-criticism &quot; or&quot; cognitions.&quot; The &quot; cognitions,&quot; as the Chinese called them, were writtenappreciations of political arguments with a Communist bias and were supposed torepresent the views of the writer on such subjects as the causes of the Koreanwar, the peace negotiations and imperialism. Sometimes the &quot; cognition &quot; was inthe form of an examination paper; sometimes it was supposed to be a freecomposition. But in either case the prisoner was not only expected to give theorthodox answer, but also to show how his understanding of the question had developed, thanks to the education he was receiving. In &quot; self-criticism &quot; theChinese expected the &quot;progressive&quot; prisoner to go through the catalogue of hispast criminal blindness and imperialistic outlook and to compare it with hisconversion to the &quot; truth.&quot;CHAPTER II&quot; RE-EDUCATING &quot; THE PRISONERSThe Chinese technique of &quot; re-education &quot; embraced every phase of dailylife in the prison, camps. Everything was designed to influence the thoughts ofthe prisoners and: make them more receptive to the Communist way of thinking.The &quot; progressive &quot; view the Communist view -was the only one allowed. Everyactivity of the prisoners, whether it was a sing-song or a private languages class,
had to be censored and sanctioned beforehand if it were not to be branded as illegaland a hostile act calling for punishment.In such an atmosphere it was inevitable that many prisoners began to say what their Chinese tutors wanted them to say simply to avoid being classed as&quot;reactionaries &quot; (the unpleasant consequences of being classed as a &quot; reactionary &quot;are discussed in a later chapter). Most of them never worked actively for theChinese, but merely put their names to &quot; peace &quot;petitions and broadcasts, inserted the right Communist jargon into their letters to relatives and friends at home, and did not resist the process of &quot;re-education.&quot;The basic means of indoctrination was originally the compulsory lecture and discussion. All British prisoners who were captured in 1950 and 1951 experiencedthese though the length of the lectures and the discussions which followed variedfrom camp to camp. When the campaign was at its height they lasted for as longas six to eight hours a day.Attendance was compulsory and absenteeism for any reason except medicalwas punished. This is evident from the disciplinary rules and regulations inoperation at Camp I at Chongson in the summer of 1951, which read as follows: -A. Disciplinary Rules:1. All captured officers and men must correctly understand the LenientPolicy of our army, observe the directions, and strictly adhere to the disciplinary rules.2. All captured officers and men shall continue to abide by the studyregulations, attend classes at the fixed times, and pay full attention to study. All squads should systematically read the issued readingmaterials. These materials must be registered and kept in good form.It is absolutely forbidden to lose or damage any of them withoutjustifiable reasons.B. Regulations :3. Every Sunday the squad should hold a daily life criticism, meeting to review in focal points, the carrying out of life and study disciplinaryrules and regulations in the past week. ...4. Except the seriously sick men who have obtained the certificate of the doctor and permission from the platoon leader (or the instructor), allthe rest must attend classes.  No pretext should be used for absence.5. While attending classes everybody must be serious and in orderly manner;should line up to report the number of men present; pay full attentionto lectures and taking notes; ask the permission from the instructorbefore leaving for latrine. The bad behaviours of disobedience, fromaction, making noises, joking and dozing are strictly forbidden.6. After lectures the monitors must carefully organise the whole squad fordiscussion and keep a record of it for reporting to the authority afterthe meeting.7. The discussion after lectures should be based upon the main ideas ofeach lecture. Everybody is allowed to voice his personal opinionfrankly and straightforwardly, no matter how it differs from that of others. The illegal acts of interrupting other speeches and disturbingthe meeting are forbidden.From the date of promulgation all captured officers and men mustget themselves ideologically prepared to observe self-consciously andenforce to the letter all provisions stipulated above. Violators shouldbe punished according to various cases.For the lectures the prisoners were issued with notebooks and ordered totake notes. Any available building was used as the lecture room; when none was available lectures were given in the open air, even during the severe Koreanwinter. Sometimes the whole camp was harangued; at other times just a platoonor company. The comfort of the prisoners was of no concern to the Chinese andthey invariably had to sit on the ground or, at the best, on bricks or home-madechairs. Attempts by the Chinese to keep the prisoners sitting in their rows bysquads were generally unsuccessful, though the discipline imposed and the genera!. atmosphere of the lectures can be gauged by this typical warning at the start of alecture: &quot; I want you to be quiet, and anyone who speaks will be sabotagingStalin.&apos;&quot;
The content of lectures varied little, all stressing the greatness and superiority of the Soviet Union and condemning the &quot; reactionaries&quot; led by American&quot;imperialists.&quot; Typical subjects were &quot;The Democratic Reformation andDemocratic structure in North Korea and the Peaceful Unification Policy inthe North Korean Government&quot;-&quot; The strength of the democratic camp,led by the great Soviet Union, is incomparably greater than that of the imperialisticcamp, led by the American imperialists  &quot; The aggressive war brought on by theAmerican imperialists and Rhee and his traitors will end in their defeat &quot; &quot; Theunrighteous nature of the war &quot; &quot; The inhumanity of the American forces &quot; &quot; The entire peace struggle against the enemy.&quot;The lectures were almost invariably followed on the same and subsequentdays by periods of discussion during which prisoners were confined to their roomsand had to talk about questions based on the lectures. A squad leader or&quot; monitor &quot; was given the task of keeping order and of recording in writing the opinions of members of his squad, either as a collective answer or as an individualanswer signed by the authors. These signed statements were, of course, preferred,for they gave the Chinese a better opportunity of assessing an individual^ views and his &quot; progressive &quot; or &quot; reactionary &quot; tendencies and potentialities.From time to time prisoners were made to undergo a written examination.The questions that had to be answered were phrased in such a manner as tosuggest the answers, and were solely designed to see whether the prisoner had understood the points made in a lecture and whether he could repeat it back. Forexample, if the subject of the lecture had been the Marxist theory of the classstruggle, one of the subsequent questions, either in a discussion or in a written examiniation, was almost bound to be &quot; What is the highest form of class struggle? &quot;The prescribed answer was: &quot;The highest form of class struggle is civil war between the exploiters and the exploited.&quot; The validity of the Marxist theoryhad to be accepted; any argument against it was &quot; reactionary &quot; and a refusal tosee the &quot; truth.&quot; The Chinese did not appreciate the answer of one British officer who said that the highest form of class struggle was &quot; travelling 1st class on a3rd class railway ticket.&quot;.The technique of group discussions is, of course, widely used in all countriesbehind the Iron Curtain, and it is notorious that those taking part are transformedinto human gramophone records. As one British soldier has said: &quot; In discussions,if there were any contrary opinions, the discussion went on until all had fallen into line, and sometimes until 10 o&apos;clock at night. In the end you were forced to concede.&quot; It was natural that in time some of the British soldiers invented meansof escaping such onerous duties. According to one prisoner, discussions in hissquad started along the right lines and then developed into a talk on football.Members of another squad found that when they argued against the &quot; partyline &quot; a Chinese instructor usually entered their hut and propounded Communismat great length. To avoid this intrusion one man,answered the questions as theyshould have been answered, another kept guard and the rest played cards.Although the value of compulsory study was limited, as the Chinese admitted when,in mid-1952, they stopped it and introduced voluntary study groups, it was not acomplete failure.Study groups appeared to have been set up spontaneously by &quot; progressive &quot;prisoners, though in view of the stringent control exercised by the Communists overevery aspect of camp life, it is more than likely that there was prompting and assistance by the camp authorities. Attendance did not necessarily imply &quot;sympathy with the Communist view. One British soldier, for instance, attended a group inorder, as he put it, &quot; to get in with the Chinese.&quot; In this way he was able to obtainmedical equipment for fellow prisoners and to obtain medical books for his ownstudy. He was in no way attracted by Communism, though by appearing to beso he was able to help prisoners with extra medical attention.On this point the opinion of one group of returned prisoners is revealingThey stated:&quot; Three types of p.w. attended voluntary study. Firstly, those who weregenuinely interested in Communism and who are still Communists nowSecondly, those who were bored and wanted something to do, and so attendedthese voluntary studies out of sheer curiosity. Thirdly, those who felt that if-., they attended they would better their lot and make life a lot easier for. themselves. There were a lot in this group and they did in fact get an easiertime, better medical attention and so on, if they attended voluntary studvgroups. .      i
&apos; On the whole, those who were, and still are, genuine Communists are in asmall minority. Of the others who attended voluntary studies for a variety,of motives, none of them appear to have been converted to Communism.&quot;Those prisoners who took no part in the voluntary study groups were not,meanwhile, given up for lost. For though the Chinese replaced compulsory massindoctrination with voluntary study groups they held fast to the idea that theycould convert prisoners to Communism by compulsory indoctrination in personalinterviews. This method took the form of conversations between a prisoner,suddenly removed from his compound, and a Chinese instructor. Normalinterrogation as understood in the West, of the &quot; name, rank, number &quot; type,naturally had a place in such conversations, but it was an excuse and not the reasonfor the talk. If a prisoner proved unco-operative, thereby showing a &quot; hostile &quot;attitude, he was usually condemned to a period of solitary confinement under very bad conditions, and invited to confess to imaginary crimes.The risk of a great deal of rough treatment was always present for a prisonerwho failed to give satisfaction. But subtler methods were also tried. Amiablechats on working conditions at home, the standard of living, and the background of parents would be accompanied by cigarettes and good food. There might be( fi walks with the instructor in the countryside round the camps a luxury for a man who has been kept in a small prison compound. But, whether the prisoner was treated well or beaten, the aim of his captors was the same to break down hisresistance to Communism and to make him collaborate with them.In the end, the prisoner or his instructor would tire of the interminableargument: either the prisoner would go on record as an incurable reactionary,or else, through sheer physical exhaustion, or fear, or genuine conversion, he would agree with the Communist viewpoint. This does not mean that every prisonerwho apparently toed the Communist line was an informer or actively assisted theChinese. The Chinese soon discovered the personal characteristics of prisoners and were able to select those who, for varying motives, such as bitterness, orambition, could and would be useful to them. For the rest, the threat of a repetition of endless talks or of another spell of solitary confinement andill-treatment was often enough to persuade them to agree to put their names tothe occasional &quot; peace petition &quot; or to insert the appropriate Communist jargoninto letters or statements.Personal indoctrination proved to be a far more potent weapon, from theChinese point of view, than the mass lectures. Whereas a man might doze ordoodle during a mass lecture he was forced to listen to talk when it was directed at him personally. And when an argument was presented by a trained andintelligent speaker and the prisoners own ability to reply was limited, even though/ he realised that the argument was specious, the danger of conversion increasedproportionately. That the Chinese achieved no more success than they did is a tribute to the resistance of the individual British soldier.The political education of prisoners in the North Korean camps was not confined to oral indoctrination. The Chinese imposed a rigid censorship, notonly on news from the outside world, but also on every form of literature. Theonly newspapers and periodicals allowed in the camps were those from communist countries or produced by Communists in the free world. In the early days of thewar even the supply of these was restricted; but throughout 1952 and 1953 theposition improved and, by the end of the war, camp libraries had twenty or thirtydaily, weekly and monthly publications. The London Daily Worker was prominentand its standard of journalism was so much higher than anything else availablethat most prisoners, even those violently anti-Communist, looked forward to it asa link with home which would provide them with news, biased though it was,of events in the outside world.For the rest of the news the prisoners had to rely on Radio Peking which wastransmitted through public address systems with which all the major camps were provided. Here again, the Chinese modified the programmes as time went on. In1951 there were only long dreary political talks, interspersed with a littlegramophone music, but these gave place later on to a good deal of sports news,with more of Tchaikowsky and Beethoven than of the Stalin Cantata. This&quot;leniency &quot; where music was concerned did not, however, extend to the prisoners&apos;songs, and anything which could be considered in any way patriotic was forbidden.The ban embraced the National Anthem and &quot; Land of Hope and Glory.&quot; In their place the Chinese tried to pur a number of Communist ditties and to make the
prisoners sing them at every opportunity. One of these (sung to the tune of &quot; JohnBrown &quot;s Body &quot;) was called &quot; Solidarity,&quot; and went like this:  &quot; Solidarity for ever,Solidarity for ever,Solidarity for ever,The Party makes us strong.&quot;By Christmas, 1951, the Chinese decided that the troops were either tone deaf or sopolitically unconscious that this sort of thing need not be taken seriously, and theydropped compulsory singing as a useless aid to &quot; education.&quot;The books supplied to the prisoners were either political or economic text booksby Communist authors or novels by authors who are accepted by the Communistsbecause their social consciousness is &quot; progressive &quot; (e.g., Dickens, Tolstoy andVictor Hugo, and among the moderns, Ilya Ehrenburg, Gorki, Sholokhov, UptonSinclair, Howard Fast and Theodore Dreiser;.Films from various countries were shown, but these, whether straightentertainment, documentary, or news-reels, always preached a Communist message.Each camp had a film show once every month or six weeks and attendance wasusually compulsory. In general the films were either pseudo-documentary and dealt with &quot; Peace &quot; Congresses, Communist Youth Festivals or Construction and reconstruction in Communist countries, or they dealt with episodes from world war II and the Korean War (with horrible scenes of &quot; American brutalities &quot;).Films which were supposed to be straight entertainment usually had as their heroesor heroines workers fighting to increase production on collective farms, in factoriesor on building sites, in the face of obstruction by reactionary managers. Themajority of these films came from Russia, with a few from China and occasionallysome from countries in Eastern Europe. The stylised forms and the touches ofVictorian melodrama usually met with such hilarious derision from most of the prisoners as to drown the Communist message.Plays and stage shows were put on by Chinese troupes or by the prisonersthemselves. The former, like the films, were vehicles for a Communist message.The latter were subjected to a censorship which displayed a mania for doublemeanings. The Chinese apparently assumed that all sentences must have a hiddenmeaning; if they could not find it, it was not because it was not there, but because it was too well hidden. This led to the deletion of even the most harmless remarks.Thus it was that the words &quot; black &quot; and &quot; yellow &quot; could not be used because theycould imply insulting references to coloured peoples; a character with the name ofMaxwell had to be changed because Maxwell was too much like Marx. But evenrigid censorship did not prevent impromptu interpolations, as for example, during a show on May 1, 1952, at Camp I, when a sergeant of the Gloucesters suddenlydeclaimed from the stage:  &quot; They seek him here,They seek him there,They seek the B . . . . everywhere,Will he be shot or will he be hung,That damned elusive Mao Tse-tung? &quot;As he finished the sergeant was dragged off the stage by the Chinese and told to get back and do something to show that he &quot; realised his mistake.&quot; Thereuponhe told a story of an Englishman, an American and a Chinese who were killed in battle and interviewed by St. Peter. Only the Chinese was refused admittancebecause &quot; We can&apos;t cook rice for one.&quot; The sergeant was again hustled off the stage, but the resultant uproar so alarmed the Chinese that they took no action.As entertainment the prisoners much preferred the sports meetings which theChinese organised and encouraged from about the middle of 1952. The sportinghighlight was undoubtedly the so-called &quot; Olympic Games,&quot; held at Pyoktong inNovember 1952. To the Games came teams from every prison camp in north korea except Camp 2 (Branch 2) a penal camp-and those camps where newlyarrived prisoners were segregated. The Games were well organised and includedtrack and field events, soccer, American football, baseball, gymnastics, volley balland so on. Those taking part were, given special sports clothes and good food,and were treated to numerous concerts and stage shows. But even in sport politicswere not forgotten.   From the start the Games were linked with the &quot;peace&quot;
movement and so with the world-wide Communist propaganda campaign. FurtherOlympics were scheduled for 1953, but the signature of the Armistice intervened.During that summer however, small sports meetings on the same pattern were held:Chinese attempts to make prisoners take part in political rallies were notsuccessful, and featured in the indoctrination campaign only during the first year or so of Chinese intervention in Korea. The biggest rally was held at Pyoktongin June 1951 to celebrate the formation of a &quot; Peace &quot; Committee in Camp 5 andthe signing of a &quot; Peace &quot; Appeal. At this time camp conditions were appalling,with men dying at the rate of up to twenty a day from malnutrition, beri-beri anddysentery. The prisoners were therefore in no physical or mental condition torefuse to take part. Even so, with most of the prisoners either apathetic or passivelyhostile, it was hardly a success, though numerous photographs of the event were published in Chinese magazines with the caption &quot; Prisoners-of-War join the Causeof Peace.&quot;CHAPTER iii the &quot;PEACE&quot; CAMPAIGNThe Chinese were quick to realise that the longing of prisoners for peace sothat they could return home, if properly handled, would provide excellent material for the Communist &quot; peace &quot; campaign, and &quot; peace &quot; soon became the major themein the indoctrination campaign.From lectures on &quot; peace,&quot; both to groups and to individuals, it was but ashort step, as shown in the previous chapter, to the production of &quot; peace &quot;propaganda and &quot; peace &quot; petitions by prisoners. And it was but another shortstep from the production of &quot; peace &quot; propaganda to the formation of &quot; peacecommittees,&quot; which became for a time the main Chinese indoctrination weapon.For the Chinese these committees had several advantages. They could useprisoners in their efforts to convert other prisoners; &quot; peace&quot; appeals fromsupposedly spontaneously formed groups of prisoners would obviously have morevalue in the free world than Chinese-prepared appeals; members of camp&quot; peace committees &quot; might, on their return home, join similar organisations andso extend Communist influence in their country; and prisoners who joined &quot; peacecommittees &quot; would find it more difficult to refuse to co-operate with the Chineseon other matters.The first &quot; peace committee &quot; in the North Korean prison camps was set upin February 1951, in Camp 10, at Kanggye. It met with little success, though itwas responsible for the prisoners in the camp signing the Stockholm Peace Appealand producing a &quot; peace petition.&quot; The story of this petition is a good illustrationof Chinese methods. The Chinese told the committee&apos;s chairman that they wanted a petition saying that the prisoners had been duped into joining the war in Koreawhere they were being used as cannon-fodder to keep the hostilities going so asto swell the coffers of the Wall Street financiers and warmongers. The actualwording was left to the committee, who decided that the best thing to do was toproduce an innocuous document which would be useless as propaganda. In all,five documents were produced. All were rejected by the Chinese because theydid not include the sentiments asked for. The Chinese then produced a petitionof their own, but the committee refused to sign it and ordered other prisoners tofollow its lead. After threats and intimidation the committee agreed to sign itso long as the rest of the prisoners were exempted. The Chinese agreed to this.The signing of that petition after Chinese threats and intimidation was the lastactivity of the &quot; peace committee&quot; of Camp 10. Not for another two monthswas another &quot; peace committee &quot; formed at Camp. 12 near Pyongyang, which wasrun by the North Koreans, and became known as the&quot; Peace-fighters&apos; Camp.&quot;The original suggestion that a &quot; peace committee &quot; should be set up in thiscamp is supposed to have come from a British private, a member of the BritishCommunist Party, at the time of his capture. Whether this is true or not it is known that Colonel Kim, the North Korean camp commander, suggested to the prisoners in the camp that now that they had had the opportunity to understand the true state
of affairs in the world they should form a &quot; peace committee &quot; to co-ordinate their efforts in the fight for peace. Whatever its real origin, the idea was supposedlyaccepted and the prisoners in Camp 12 duly &quot;asked&quot; General Kim II Sung,Supreme Commander of the North Korean Army, for &quot; permission &quot; to form a united States-British War Prisoners&apos; Peace Organisation. &quot; Permission&quot; was granted on May 9, 1951.According to the Chinese this move was so enthusiastically received in othercamps that they, too, &quot; requested &quot; and were granted &quot; permission &quot; by GeneralKim II Sung to form United States-British peace organisations. Camp 7, alsoKorean-run, received its &quot; permission &quot; on May 14, only five days after Camp 12-a remarkable feat when it is considered that the two camps were at the oppositeends of North Korea. At Camp 5 the &quot; peace committee &quot; was not formed untilJune. But here, as in the case of Camp 12, there is some doubt about the initialorganisation. The Chinese claimed that during studies the prisoners stated thatthey were against the aggressive war in Korea, which was led by a handful of american &quot; imperialists,&quot; and wanted to &quot; join and add momentum to the peacemovement.&quot; On the other hand, a British prisoner has said that the suggestionthat a &quot; peace committee &quot; be formed was advanced by one of the Chineseinstructors following a &quot; Peace Lecture.&quot; At any rate &quot; peace committees &quot; were started in Camps 5, 7 and 12, and representatives from them were selected to formthe &quot; Central Committee of the United States-British War Prisoners PeaceOrganisation in Korea,&quot; which was established in Camp 12.Three months elapsed before a &quot; peace committee &quot; was formed in Camp 1.During that time an intensive indoctrination campaign was carried on in an attemptto make the inmates responsive. The campaign started in July when the campcommander told the prisoners that they would send a telegram of good wishes tothe Chicago Peace Conference. To allay suspicions, this was described as a meetingof representatives of all religious and philanthropic organisations in the UnitedStates to discuss peace and international relations. Though the British officersand sergeants and many Other Ranks refused to have anything to do with the telegram, it was sent off in the name of the whole camp. Towards the end ofAugust a statement by the camp commander that &quot; companies may elect peacerepresentatives to a peace committee&quot; heralded a month of &quot; softening-up&quot;education. Then, on September 25, it was announced that an election for a &quot; peacecommittee &quot; would take place by October 1, when the event and the Chinesenational day would both be celebrated. The officers were forbidden to take anypart in the election as a punishment for their past &quot; reactionary &quot; activities. TheBritish sergeants were allowed to vote, but all returned blank ballot papers.While they lasted, the &quot; peace committees &quot; played a major role in theCommunist indoctrination campaign, mainly by acting as a channel through whichpropaganda was fed to the prisoners. The work of the Central Committee included the publication of a weekly newspaper, the Peace Fighters&apos; Chronicle, pamphletsand articles, and the preparation of surrender appeals, atrocity stories, andbroadcasts for Peking or Pyongyang Radio. On a smaller scale the campcommittees carried out much the same work. In addition the committees were responsible for passing on Communist propaganda to the outside world. Here,their main task was the production of a series of &quot; spontaneous&quot; and&quot; unanimous &quot; appeals and declarations addressed to the Communist-dominatedWorld Peace Council, the United Nations General Assembly and the united nations Security Council.The Chinese were well aware of the effect of such appeals on public opinion in the free world and did not fail to assist the prisoners to sign them. In the end,signature was compulsory. This is a British officer&apos;s account of what happenedduring the preparation of a &quot; peace appeal &quot; in Camp 5:&quot; The Chinese were anxious to get the officers to sign a &apos; peace appeal.&apos;Their timing, as usual, was excellent. Several officers had been returned to thecompound who had undergone severe punishment for alleged and actualoffences. The moral effect on their comrades was at its peak when a &apos; petitionfor the cessation of hostilities &apos; was produced for signature.&quot; Using the battered condition of those who had just returned to thecompound as an example of what could happen to anyone who showed himself to be &apos; an enemy of the people,&apos; and having encouraged some of these men to relate the horrors of &apos; the treatment&apos; they were able to get the signaturesof all the officers . . . .&quot;
From a British private comes this account of &quot; peace petition&quot; signing:&quot; Prisoners were taken out on parade and ordered to sign the Stockholm PeaceAppeal there was no question of the signing being voluntary. Threats of cutting down food supplies were used to persuade prisoners to sign other petitions.&quot;The North Koreans recruited &quot; peace fighters &quot; by more brutal methods. Mostof the prisoners in the Korean-run &quot;Peace Fighters&apos; Camp&quot; (Camp 12) wererecruited in small groups either from the &quot; Bean Camp,&quot; a prisoner-of-war transitcamp, or from the &quot; Caves,&quot; Camp 9, by Colonel Kim, the commander ofCamp 12.* At the &quot; Caves,&quot; which was run by the North Korean police primarilyas a camp for South Korean prisoners, treatment was brutal, medical carenon-existent, food inadequate, and the death rate high. In contrast, at Camp 12the food was good, there was medical care, and prisoners were issued with bedding,clothing, cigarettes, and soap. The temptation to succumb to the appeal ofColonel Kim to join his &quot; peace fighters &apos; camp &quot; was great, and many prisonerswho did consent to a move did so in the belief that in this way they could stayalive whereas if they stayed in the &quot; Caves &quot; they would probably die.Once in Camp 12 prisoners were expected to produce any type of propagandamaterial asked for. The Koreans wasted little time on explanations, though theydid make some attempt to indoctrinate prisoners, realising that the moreindoctrinated they were the better propaganda they would be able to produce. Solong as the prisoners did what was required of them they were well treated; if they became unco-operative they could usually be softened by threats of a return to the&quot; Caves &quot; which was virtually a death sentence. But not all succumbed. one british sergeant consistently refused to sign any petition or appeal even thoughtold that he could be ordered to sign and then be shot for refusing to obey anorder and the North Koreans usually carried out their threats. He was eventuallyreturned to the &quot; Caves.&quot; Though he survived, his punishment probablydiscouraged others from following his lead.Yet in spite of the energy the Communists expended in the formation of the camp &quot; peace committees &quot; and the lengths to which they went to make use ofthem, the committees faded out of existence in the course of one year. In October,1951, the same month in which the committee in Camp 1 was formed, the prisoners in Camp 12 were told that the war would soon be over (the armistice negotiations had started a few weeks earlier) and that they would be returned to their own campsas a prelude to their release. Members of the &quot;Central Committee of the UnitedStates-British War Prisoners Peace Organisation in Korea&quot; and other&quot; progressives &quot; were told that they and their &quot; enlightened &quot; views might not be popular in other camps and that they should therefore drop political activities andenter into any work that had as its aim the improvement of camps&apos; materialconditions. By serving on messing and sports committees, for example, it was hoped that they would be accepted by other prisoners and that their views wouldbe treated with more respect.However, when some of the members of the Central Committee returned toCamp 5 in November, they found that the camp staff expected them to carry on&quot; peace &quot; work in the camp, replacing the camp committee. They refused and organised a strike, claiming that in Camp 12 they had undertaken &quot; peace &quot; work under duress. The Chinese gave way, though the strike leader was later jailed for six months, despite a promise that he would not be punished. That was the endof the Central Committee and also of the committee in Camp 5. Camp 7 ceased to exist altogether in November when its prisoners were removed from Korean toChinese custody. The committee in Camp 1 ceased at about the same time.Though the war continued for another 18 months, the Chinese made no attempt to resuscitate the &quot; peace committees.&quot; Instead they relied on&quot; progressives &quot; and a system of intimidation when they wanted signatures for anappeal or petition. As one soldier has said: &quot; Various petitions and appeals were produced for signature and the men soon realised that although no immediatepunishment ensued for those who refused to sign they were earmarked and laterarrested and punished on false charges.&quot; Thus it was that, after the death of the&quot; peace committees,&quot; &quot; peace &quot; petitions and appeals and open letters still continuedto emanate from the camps.* The &quot; Bean Camp &quot; was so called because beans were the staple diet there. The &quot; Caves &quot;consisted of a number of damp caves or tunnels in a hill.
CHAPTER iv the ROLE OF &quot; PROGRESSIVES &quot;The &quot; re-education &quot; of prisoners through the medium of other prisoners whohad seen the &quot; truth &quot; could obviously in certain circumstances be more effective than direct indoctrination. The Chinese recognised this and &quot; progressives &quot; weresoon given a major role to play as mouthpieces of Communist propaganda. The&quot; peace committees,&quot; which were generally run by co-operative prisoners, are an example of this technique; so are the voluntary study groups. But there areothers, such as the camp committees.In prison camps for officers, says the P.O.W. Convention (Article 79), &quot; the senior officer among the prisoners-of-war shall be recognised as the camp prisoners&apos;representative.&quot; In camps for other prisoners &quot; the prisoners shall freely electby secret ballot .... prisoners&apos; representatives entrusted with representing them before the military authorities.&quot; The task of these representatives is to &quot; further the physical, spiritual, and intellectual well-being of prisoners-of-war.&quot; On the surface the camp committees set up in the North Korean prison camps appearedto fulfil all these conditions and the Chinese went to some lengths to keep up thisappearance. One propaganda pamphlet they produced quoted a - prisoner assaying: &quot; In every company of every P.O.W. camp in North Korea there is aclub. The club covers every phase of the daily life of the P.O.W.s with theexception of details and discipline. By means of the club the P.O.W.s can verylargely administer their own welfare. The club members are given a free handand encouraged to extend their activities within their own particular sphere.&quot; Itwas also explained that the committees had sections dealing with recreation,sanitation, messing and mail, information and library, and sports and cluhroom.To point the moral it was added: &quot; The club is a demonstration of the effectiveness of the Lenient Treatment Policy which the Korean People&apos;s Army and the ChinesePeopled Volunteers extend to P.O.W.s.&quot;But the gulf between the facade, which suggested a holiday camp, and thereality, was enormous. The P.O.W. Convention presupposes that the detaining power will listen to, and act upon the suggestions or complaints put forward byprisoners&apos; representatives; it takes no account of the Chinese concern for &quot; face &quot;which made it almost impossible for them to accept any suggestion which didnot emanate from themselves. Requests for improvements in camp conditions were met with the excuse that they were unnecessary because under the LenientPolicy, prisoners were generously provided with everything they could possiblyneed. In fact the Chinese made improvements in the camps as they saw fit and what they did bore little relation to what the camp committees requested.Although their value to the prisoners was doubtful (they were not oftenresponsible for any noticeable improvement in camp conditions) the campcommittees, variously described as &quot; Daily Life Committees &quot; and &quot; ClubCommittees,&quot; were a potent factor in the Chinese indoctrination campaign.Through their activities, committee members were bound to be brought intoconsiderable contact with the Chinese, and could, therefore, be indoctrinatedon a personal basis; they could then be used for indoctrinating their fellowprisoners. When converted, committee members would put the interests of theChinese before those of the prisoners; their reward was small privileges andperquisites.All this implied careful selection of committee members. This was notdifficult, even though in this matter the letter of the P.O.W. Convention was observed and elections were held, for the Chinese soon narrowed the field byrejecting any &quot; reactionary &quot; candidate as &quot; unfit &quot; to represent his fellow prisoners.Sometimes they limited the candidates to squad leaders who had been appointedby themselves. Ballots were at times open; when they were &quot; secret &quot; the ballot papers were scrutinised before they were dropped into the ballot box. Conse-quently the results of the &quot; elections &quot; were never in doubt. In the club committeeof the British company in Camp 5, which comprised 17 members and a Chinesechairman, six were confirmed Communist sympathisers, and five were leading&quot; progressives.&quot; Between them they controlled the more important posts in thecommittee, being in charge of news, mail, library and recreation. The presenceon the committee of other prisoners who never co-operated with the Chinese was merely an example of the well-known Communist technique of trying to make&quot; front &quot; organisations look respectable.
The pattern, of course, was not everywhere the same, and in some camps theChinese were unsuccessful in using camp committees for their own ends. thus in the officers&apos; compound of Camp 1, where, from June 1951, British officers werein a majority, the &quot; election &quot; for a camp committee was turned into a pantomime.The committee never met and the officers continued to regard their own senior officers as the source of directives. When Camp 2 was formed and officers were moved there, the Chinese called for a camp committee which, because they didnot recognise ranks, had to be chosen in a &quot; democratic &quot; election. The prisonersresponded by electing members previously selected by their senior officers. Thecommittee included a sub-committee on study whose job it was to stimulate and assist the prisoners&apos; education. In practice, it argued the prisoners&apos; point of viewto the Chinese. Finally, having achieved nothing, the committee resigned en masse;within four months the majority of the members had been sentenced to varyingterms of solitary confinement for &quot; reactionary activities.&quot; When the Chinesedemanded the election of a new committee they were met with a refusal to electany but the surviving senior officers and were thus forced to appoint their ownnominees. From then on the chairman became the intermediary between theChinese and the prisoners for the organisation of parades and working parties.Below the club committees in the Chinese-imposed chain of command were thesquad leaders and monitors, appointed by their captors with the task of assistingin the control and indoctrination of fellow prisoners. Although Article 44 of theP.O.W. Convention lays down that &quot; Officers and prisoners of equivalent status shallbe treated with the regard due to their rank and age,&quot; the Chinese argued that allsoldiers lost their rank when they became prisoners. It was therefore logical forthem to appoint squad-leaders without any reference to seniority and in the early days they seem to have gone to some trouble to appoint the youngest and mostjunior soldiers, in the hope that they would be more malleable, and as the best means of breaking down the discipline of the men in their charge. The Chinesealways emphasised that within a squad the authority of the squad-leader wassupreme, even if some of the members were officers and N.C.O.s. When this failedto break down the discipline and the normal chain of command of British soldiers,officers and sergeants were segregated into their own companies and eventuallyinto their own camps.The squad-leaders usually also acted as monitors and had the job of controlling the compulsory discussions held after the early compulsory lectures, and ofreporting to the Chinese on the &quot; political progress &quot; being made by the men in hissquad. When compulsory discussion ended and the emphasis shifted to voluntarystudy the raison d&apos;etre of the monitors ceased and the post lapsed. Simultaneouslysquad-leaders became responsible only for parades, roll-calls, and fatigues. Itwould therefore be untrue to say that all who acted as squad-leaders or monitorswere &quot; progressive &quot; or co-operated in some way with the Chinese. Indeed, though some were undoubtedly &quot; progressive &quot; and did collaborate for varying motives,there were others who were prepared to risk the odium of suspected collaborationso that they could help their fellow prisoners.During the period of compulsory education a certain number of prisoners were used as lecturers. The lectures usually consisted of disquisitions by &quot; progressives &quot;who, for motives of their own, were prepared publicly to flatter the Chinese bypreaching about the beauties of the Lenient Policy. Here is an extract from notestaken at one lecture given by a British prisoner: &quot; Good treatment on capture. . . .Disbelieved previous promises of clothing, &amp;c. . . . and adopted a reactionaryattitude. . .. When the peace talks went wrong realised that the Chinese had alwaysbeen right and changed his attitude to study.   Policy:  (a) be friendly with Chinese and help others to be friendly towards them;(b) keep an open mind on study and help others to do so;(c) help all in your power in the peace struggle.&quot;The heyday of such activities was the period when the Chinese wereconcentrating on the &quot; peace &quot; campaign, and the campaigns for signatures to&quot; peace &quot; appeals gave plenty of scope for oratory. Selected prisoners were also given the freedom of the camp loudspeaker system to expound their Communisttheories or to tender their thanks to the. Chinese. When compulsory study gaveway to the voluntary study groups the orators transferred their attentions to thelatter.The &quot; progressives &quot; did more than talk, and during the years that the north korean camps were in existence they produced a mass of printed propaganda for
distribution among the prisoners in their own and other camps. For example,most companies, except those containing officers and sergeants, published wallnewspapers with articles on all the usual Communist themes, including the evilsof life in capitalist countries, the joy of living under Communism, Americanatrocities, and so on. Chinese censorship was strict. Personal reminiscences weremostly of the &quot; How I saw the Truth &quot; variety; everything else either followed theCommunist line or failed to appear. There were never any articles about the coronation and an article ridiculing an attack on the British Government wassuppressed.Nevertheless, the Chinese publicised these newspapers: &quot; United Nations&apos;prisoners of war in Korea,&quot; they stated, &quot; have a large and varied press, writtenand edited by themselves. Hand-printed company papers, posted regularly in theclubs, bear such names as Peace Dove, Torch, Times, Standard, Globe, Outpost,Daily News,  Weekly Courier or  even in one case Camp Quacks.....Besides editorials and international and home news, these papers carry sportscolumns, book and movie notes, a science column, short stories or serialised fiction,personal reminiscences, a mailbag, bridge and chess problems, general knowledgequizzes and instructions on playing the guitar or other instruments.&quot;As well as company publications there was a newspaper called Towards Truthand Peace which was published in Camp 5 at roughly fortnightly intervals from1952 onwards and circulated in all camps. Its source of news was the CommunistPress of non-Communist countries, the Press of Communist countries, and theChinese and Peking radios.CHAPTER VMETHODS OF &quot;PERSUASION&quot;Even in reasonably good conditions the life of a prisoner-of-war tends to depress and enervate those who do not stoutly resist its effects. Normally, however,these effects are quickly relieved even if they cannot be forgotten after peace and liberty are restored. The Chinese were concerned with more than theimmediate objects of maintaining security in the prison-camps and deriving military information from interrogations. Their purpose as Communists was to make amuch more lasting mark on the personalities and opinions of the men in their hands, and for this &quot; re-education &quot; they knew that the time available was likelyto be short. Sooner or later the surviving prisoners would return to their homes,and any ideas which they had consciously or unconsciously absorbed while in the camps would meet the challenge of their own familiar environment.Everything, therefore, was tried by the Chinese in pursuit of the desired result:simple psychological pressure, manipulation of welfare conditions, corruption,threats, segregation, force and outright torture. The first step was to undermineaccepted loyalties and discipline by strictly prohibiting distinctions of rank,punishing any officer or N.C.O. who attempted to give an order and encouraging the humiliation of officers. In place of the normal chain of military command the Chinese tried to establish, as described in the previous chapter, a system ofcontrol through &quot; squad-leaders.&quot; The second step, after reducing prisoners toa uniform level of inferiority, was to endeavour to impress upon them thesuperiority of the Chinese. The homesickness and bitterness of prisoners is notdifficult to play upon. The Chinese continually harped upon the theme that themen had been duped by their reactionary rulers, led into an unjust and hopelessconflict, and then abandoned to their fate because the United Nations Command&quot; obviously &quot; did not want the armistice that would bring them release. Repeatedday after day to men suffering from starvation, disease and neglect, andaccompanied by the deliberate dissemination of bad rather than good news, these arguments in many cases caused prisoners to abandon all hope of victory, releaseand life. By the time that conditions in the camps improved many had been pushedby one means and another too far along the path of submission and collaborationto go back.The Informer system in addition there was the widespread system of informers introduced by theChinese for the close control of prisoners a system which inevitably spread fear
and distrust of a man&apos;s neighbours until will-power was paralysed by suspicion.One such system was operated by English-speaking Chinese guards and instructorswho specialised in eavesdropping. But the sources of information on which theChinese mainly relied were found among the prisoners themselves. By no meansall of the prisoners who informed on their comrades did so either willingly or,indeed, consciously. There were, it is true, a few of them who went to some troubleto assist the Chinese. The others were induced or forced under various forms ofinterrogation to implicate their friends. &quot; Who are your friends?&quot; was a frequentopening question, and there were ways of getting details from a weak or talkativeprisoner who at the time did not^ realise that he was giving away his companions.When once a prisoner had been made to inform by brutality, or guile, or both,he would nearly always be blackmailed into supplying further information bythreats of exposure or of more punishment. The effectiveness of such threats isshown by this account, by a British officer, of the treatment of an Americanofficer:&quot; . . . . He was kept in solitary confinement for three weeks. during his confinement he was savagely beaten and tortured. When he returned tothe compound he was morally and physically broken. He told the other officers never to discuss anything in his presence as he had been sent back toact as an informer and threatened with worse torture if he did not comply.His treatment had left him very weak and he no longer had any will to live.... and eventually died about two weeks after his release.&quot;At the other end of the scale were those prisoners who were voluntaryinformers. It is difficult to place these men in any particular category. Someundoubtedly were &quot; progessives &quot; who drifted into informing because of Chineseinsistence on active and positive co-operation from those who had any sympathy with the Communist viewpoint; others were not &quot; progressive &quot; and acted solelyfrom motives of selfishness, personal safety and profit; others, again, were probablyinformers first and then tried to rationalise their actions by adopting the right sort of political sentiments. As a result of the activities of all these informers a prisoner was liable to be called away to company or camp headquarters at any moment to answer for some &quot; crime,&quot; sometimes he returned in a few hours,sometimes in a few days, sometimes he did not return at all. The distrust thussown among the prisoners, the fear of doing or saying anything for which an account might have to be rendered, was a major weapon in the Chinese campaign to undermine morale and personal loyalties and thus to &quot; encourage &quot; acceptanceof the Communist viewpoint.Manoeuvring with MailAs a further inducement to co-operation the Chinese made great use ofoutgoing and incoming mail. The anxiety of prisoners to let their families know that they were alive was at first entirely frustrated (and the provisions of the prisoners-of-War Convention on this subject thereby flouted) until, at the end ofAugust 1951, the Chinese first allowed prisoners to write home. On a number of occasions attempts were made to dictate the contents, and even the wording, of these letters; and though this practice was soon dropped it had been impressed on themen that if letters were to reach their destinations they should include phrasespraising conditions in the camps and condemning the Americans.Outgoing mail was, as far as the Chinese were concerned, no more than a vehicle for propaganda. Apart from the injection of suitable sentiments into the letters of men desperately keen: to get a word home to their families, specialpostmarks and forwarding instructions added propaganda slogans. Even so therewas no certainty that letters would reach their destinations. Some families in britain only received three or four letters in two or three years, some receivedmore and some received none at all. Chinese inefficiency and lack of concernwere clearly responsible for this; but the lie was invariably spread that any mailwhich failed to reach its destination had been destroyed by the Americans toprevent the world from knowing the &quot; truth.&quot; One British prisoner who became a Communist went so far as to say that &quot; the American destruction of British mail &quot;was a factor in his conversion. But it soon became known in the camps that theChinese were destroying or neglecting to forward mail, and a returned prisonerhas reported that he saw a pile of torn-up letters outside the barbers shop nearhis camp. &apos;
In dealing with incoming mail the Chinese seem to have been haphazard intheir methods, for some prisoners received no letters at all and others for no obvious reason as many as 300 during their captivity. However, there were several occasions when prisoners undergoing interrogation were offered letters inreturn for information; and &quot; reactionary &quot; prisoners were told that their mailwas being withheld as a punishment.Food and MedicineTwo other major weapons of the Chinese in their campaign to &quot; encourage &quot;co-operation were food and medicine. In the early months of 1951 food wasgrossly inadequate in the prison camps in North Korea, and if prisoners receiveda couple of bowls of cracked corn, millet or sorghum a day they consideredthemselves fortunate. By the end of that year the staple diet consisted of ricewith a few vegetables and a little meat, and the incidence of beri-beri and otherailments caused by malnutrition declined. But prisoners who had experienced theearly days never forgot the fear of not having enough to eat, and more than oneprisoner has said that he co-operated with the Chinese in a comparatively minorway, such as by signing a petition, because he was threatened with a cut in rationsif he refused. Sizes of rations also varied and &quot; progressive &quot; prisoners weresometimes given more and better food. On one occasion prisoners in Camp 2 whocomplained about their food were told that the inmates of Camp 5 &quot; are progressiveand study well so of course they feed better.&quot;In the same way medical attention was provided when any was provided at all on a selective basis. Until the middle of 1951 medical services for prisoners were almost non-existent and they died in hundreds. Doctors who were taken prisoner were forbidden to give any treatment until they had studied and learntthe &quot; truth.&quot; One doctor was told that he was a bad one because he did not knowwhom to save and whom to let die. But even when the Chinese attached theirown medical personnel to the camps conditions for many did not improve, andthe progressives &quot; usually received whatever supplies of medicine were availablewhile the &quot; reactionaries &quot; went without. One private who was wounded and taken prisoner on April 24, 1951, was given no attention until June 1953, and then it was not really necessary. It was given, he believes, to make his partingimpressions of the Chinese favourable; his record in opposing the Chinese wasoutstanding.Physical Brutality - .When all these methods of inducement had failed and in some cases before they had been tried the Chinese had recourse to methods of physical coercionand torture, revolting to the humane mind and expressly forbidden by thePrisioners-of-War Convention. Before the middle of 1951 the Chinese adopted the simple attitude that if a prisoner would not co-operate he was punished. If the punishment resulted in his death it was because he was an obstinate &quot; warcriminal.&quot; Later the argument was changed, and physical punishment was saidto be inflicted for specific offences rather than a general refusal to see &quot; the light.&quot;Torture and all-treatment were carried out quite cold-bloodedly for the purposeof breaking a man&apos;s resistance.For this purpose solitary confinement was sometimes sufficient in itself. Thisis hardly to be wondered at, for the conditions of this punishment were appalling.According to one of the victims, the &quot; normal &quot; treatment while in solitary confine-in ent at Camps was &quot; to be made to stand or sit at attention (legs outstretched)and in complete silence from 04.30 hours to 23.00 hours daily. For the remainder of the day prisoners were allowed to sleep but were continually roused by the guard&apos; to make sure they were still there.&apos; &quot; There were no beds and no bedding. Shoesand clothing, except for underclothes, were often taken away, even in the middleof winter; washing facilities were often denied, sometimes for months at a time,while visits to the latrine would be permitted only once or twice a day, even whenthe prisoner had dysentery. At Camp 1 the Chinese built a number of boxesabout 5 ft. by 3 ft. by 2 ft. for prisoners undergoing sentences of solitaryconfinement. In one of these one private of the Gloucesters spent just over sixmonths. The food was appalling and often stopped for several days at a time.Water was inadequate and one prisoner, though he had three meals a day, received no soup, water or boiled food. This went on for eleven days and when hecomplained he was told that fluids were being withheld to help him with his&quot; self-reflections.&quot;
If the Chinese wanted results quickly this treatment was intensified, andbeating in one form or another was fairly common. A corporal of the Gloucesterswho refused to give any information at all to the Chinese was taken out oneevening at 9 o&apos;clock at night and beaten by two Chinese until 3 o&apos;clock in the morning with a club similar to a baseball bat. He had to stand to attention,stripped to the waist. At one point another Chinese came and took him downto the river and gave him a personal beating for some reason of his own. prisoners were often bound with rope or wire for long periods; sometimes handcuffs were used. One British prisoner spent eight months in handcuffs which were frequentlytightened.A favourite trick was to bind a prisoner hand and foot with a rope passed over a beam, fixed as a hangman&apos;s noose round his neck. He was then hoistedup on his toes and a spare end of the noose rope was tied to his ankles. the prisoner was told that if he slipped or bent his knees he would be committingsuicide and that his captors could not be held responsible as his life was in hisown hands. Another favourite method was to bind a prisoners wrists and anklesbehind his back and to tie a rope, which passed over a beam, to his wrists. Hewas then hoisted up until his toes just touched the floor and left in that position for several hours.Yet another form of punishment during solitary confinement was to makea prisoner stand to attention for long periods, either in the snow of the severeKorean winter or in the heat of a Korean summer. One British prisoner, forinstance, was made to stand to attention for thirty hours at a time, with a sentrywith a fixed bayonet as &quot; encouragement.&quot; Another was made to kneel on two small jagged rocks and hold a large rock over his head with his arms extended. it took days for a man who had undergone this treatment to recover the ability towalk. Sometimes the North Korean guards on the order of higher authority pushed a long pencil-like piece of wood or metal through a small hole in the doorand made the prisoner hold the inner end in his teeth. At odd times, without warning, the sentry would knock the outer end sideways. This had the dual effectof removing teeth and splitting the sides of the victim&apos;s mouth. A variation of thiswas for the guard to hit the outer end of the rod and so drive the other end againstthe back of the prisoners mouth or down his throat. In v/inter opportunities fortorture increased, and prisoners are known to have been marched barefooted onto the frozen Yalu river where water was poured over their feet. With temperatureswell below 20 degrees of frost the water froze immediately, and prisoners were left for hours with their feet frozen into the ice to &quot; reflect &quot; on their crimes.Many of the guards in charge of prisoners in solitary confinement were adeptat this sort of brutality and seem to have been given full rein to stand prisoners toattention, spit on them, kick them, beat them, prod them with bayonets, wake them at odd times throughout the night and humiliate them at will. Such treatment wasnot exceptional; it was the normal fate of the prisoner who steadfastly refused toco-operate or who was sufficiently important in Chinese eyes to merit intensive&quot; conditioning.&quot;The prisoner who broke down under Chinese torture and there v/ere many who did not would have to write a &quot; confession &quot; of crimes which he, and theChinese, knew he had never committed. On the basis of this, he could be triedand sentenced; though usually he was merely told that the trial had been held, andthat the sentence had been this or that punishment. If the Chinese went to the trouble of holding a &quot; military tribunal &quot; the accuseds share in the proceedings was limited to pleading guilty to the charges and reading his confession. The sentencewas then announced from a prepared typescript; there was no defence.Alternatively, the prisoner was made to read his confession to the whole camp;but more often he did not appear at all and his sentence, with or without hisconfession, was announced on parade. Frequently no announcement was made and the prisoner just vanished.The sentence invariably consisted of solitary confinement and, according tothe circumstances, the prisoner served all or some or none of it. If he was releasedat once he was liable to be warned, at frequent intervals, that his sentence hadmerely been suspended and that he could be made to serve it if he did not showthat his &quot; repentance &quot; was &quot; sincere.&quot; Sometimes, having served the sentence, the prisoner was sentenced to another term or, more commonly, was kept in solitaryconfinement, long after his sentence had expired, without a new sentence. It isknown, for example, that one British officer who was sentenced to six months,actually served fifteen; another British officer, similarly sentenced to six months,
served eighteen. Many such prisoners never returned to their compounds but were sent to one of the penal camps Camp 2 (Branch 2) or Camp 2 (Branch 3).Segregation and Penal Camps - ;When neither incentives nor deterrents were successful in forcing a prisonersco-operation the Chinese had to adopt a policy of segregation, removing thosewho were regarded as beyond redemption and as a hindrance to the conversionof their fellows to separate camps and compounds. The first attempts to&quot; re-educate &quot; all ranks together (with officers and N.C.O.s taking orders fromChinese-appointed squad leaders and monitors) were made in Camps 1 and 5,two of the first major permanent camps to be set up in North Korea. It soonproved a failure and officers and sergeants were separated from other ranks incompanies which were some distance from those of the O.Rs. In October, 1951,segregation was carried a stage further and the officers from both camps were sentto a camp of their own, Camp 2 (Branch 1) at Pih Chon-ni. Segregation went a stage further in August, 1952, with the removal of the sergeants from both Camp 1and Camp 5 to a camp of their own Camp 4 (warrant officers were treated asofficers and were held in Camp 2 (Branch 1)).But the segregation of officers and sergeants by no means removed all the&quot; reactionaries.&quot; The Chinese were forced, as early as August, 1951, to establishCamp 3 (Branch 1) to which they sent about 160 of the unco-operative prisoners from Camp 5. Included in this total were 14 British. In the early days of its existence Camp 3 (Branch 1) was a penal camp and no mail was ever receivedfrom any of the British who were in it. It was divided into two sections; onehousing the original prisoners and the other the later arrivals. No contact betweenthe two sections was allowed. In August, 1952, as part of a general re-organisationof camps, the British prisoners were sent to Camps 1 and 5, with the exception oftwo sergeants who went to Camp 4, and five of the toughest cases who were sentto another penal camp, Camp 2 (Branch 2).This camp, established in August, 1952, held 135 prisoners, including 31British, and was the home of the hard core of Other Rank reactionaries men whohad distinguished themselves by their heroic resistance to all Chinese brutality.Discipline was much stricter here than in any other camp and, in the early days atleast, rations were kept to the minimum required for survival. Attached to Camp 2(Branch 2) were two other groups of prisoners who were permitted no contact withthe outside world; one comprised 16 men, including one British sergeant, who hadundergone a good deal of interrogation and brutality for their opposition to theChinese; the other consisted of 18 men, most of whom had suffered appallingly,who were undergoing long sentences of solitary confinement for attempted escapesand &quot; reactionary &quot; activities. The camp closed in June, 1953, and the inmatesreturned to Camps 1 and 5.The officer equivalent of Camp 2 (Branch 2) as a penal camp, was Camp 2(Branch 3). This contained prisoners who had been sentenced for various &quot; plots &quot;and &quot; reactionary &quot; activities or for having a &quot; hostile attitude &quot;; officers andair-crews captured after January 1952; and those who because of their formerduties were considered by the Chinese as &quot; spies.&quot; All were regarded as rather&quot; special criminals.&quot; Until the Armistice was signed, food and treatment in the camp were consistently bad, and some prisoners remained in solitary confinementthroughout their stay there.CHAPTER vi the ROLE OF VISITORSUntil the last few weeks of the war, independent visitors and organisationssuch as the International Red Cross were barred by the Chinese from the prison-camps. On the other hand, facilities were readily arranged for visits byCommunists and Communist sympathisers.In all, the Chinese used five British Commonwealth visitors in their cause,These were: Mr. Alan Winnington of the London Daily Worker; Mr. WilfredBurchett, an Australian by birth, who went to China as a correspondent for the left-wing Paris Ce Soir, and later UHumanite, and then on to Korea; Mr. MichaelShapiro, a correspondent of the London Daily Worker, resident in Peking;
Mr. Jack Gaster, a member of the British Communist Party and a London solicitor;and Mrs. Monica Felton, chairman of the British National Association of Women,which is affiliated to the Women&apos;s International Democratic Federation, aninternational Communist &quot; front &quot; organisation.As a correspondent of a Communist newspaper it was natural thatMr. Winnington should follow the Communist line in reporting the Korean war.He produced lurid accounts of germ warfare (including a description of a raidwhich he himself is supposed 1 to have witnessed), harrowing stories of the&quot; indiscriminate &quot; bombing of civilians, descriptions of the happy lives supposed to be led by prisoners in the North Korean camps, and of massacre, torture andbrutality suffered by the Chinese and North Koreans in the prison-campscontrolled by the United Nations.His main role in North Korea was that of visiting propagandist. The factthat he once referred to captured officers as &quot; a lot of bloody Fascists,&quot; and thatone officer received no further medical attention after a brush with him, mayhave made him fight shy of visiting the officers&apos; and sergeants&apos; camps but he went to Camps 1 and 5 on a number of occasions, where he had personal talks with selected prisoners and gave lectures on such subjects as the Korean peacetalks, the aims of the world &quot; peace &quot; conferences, and the &quot; appalling conditions &quot;in the United States and Britain. At the Camp 5 (the &quot; Progressives&apos; Camp &quot;) heappeared to be fairly welcome; at Camp 1, on the other hand, his lectures wereoften greeted with shouts of &quot; You&apos;11 hang,&quot; &quot; traitor,&quot; and so on.Burchett, like Winnington, collected prisoners&apos; mail, chatted to suitable men,and gave lectures; but he too was not well received in Camp 1.The Chinese seem to have used the other Daily Worker correspondent,Shapiro, less as a propagandist than as an interrogator. He was first seen byprisoners in Korea in February 1951 when he individually interrogated andinterviewed men captured near Seoul the previous month. At the time the materialconditions of the prisoners were extremely poor and he promised to provide books,D.D.T., scissors, matches and cigarettes, and to make arrangements for shavesand haircuts; the result of his promise was one copy of &quot; A Tale of Two Cities &quot;and two copies of the Shanghai News.During the interrogations one sergeant of the Royal Ulster Rifles, who wassuffering from dysentery and the early symptoms of beri-beri, from which he laterdied, told Shapiro that he was the &quot; poorest example of an Englishman I&apos;ve everseen, and if I could get my fingers round your scrawny neck I&apos;d wring it.&quot; Shapiroretaliated by having him marched out with the comment: &quot; Fll have you shot.&quot;This remark was perhaps not meant seriously but the early death of the sergeantsuggests that he was given little medical attention. At about the same time Shapirolectured a number of American prisoners, telling them that they were&quot; warmongering dogs who deserve to die like dogs.&quot; According to an Americanofficer, he also visited the notorious &quot; Death Valley &quot; camp near Pyoktong where he seemed amused to see the prisoners dying fast of malnutrition and neglect.It is perhaps not surprising that Shapiro&apos;s attitude and activities even disgusted a prisoner who was a member of the British Communist Party.Gaster visited China and North Korea in March 1952 as a member of the delegation of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, anotherinternational Communist &quot; front&quot; organisation which, at the invitation of theChinese and North Korean Governments, &quot; investigated &quot; charges of bacteriologicalwarfare and atrocities by United Nations troops. During his visit he went toCamps 1 and 5 and on his return to Britain he contributed to the Daily workers glowing account of camp conditions. Prisoners, he wrote, &quot; get more meat,more fats, and more sugar to eat than anyone in Britain receives from a ration book.&quot;Mrs. Felton first visited Korea as a member of a delegation from the Women&apos;international Democratic Federation in May 1951, and on her return wrote abook called that&apos;s Why I Went. This purported to show that she was originallyopen-minded but subsequently became convinced, as a result of &quot; proofs &quot; which she was shown, of wholesale murder, torture and rape carried out by the united nations forces. She also brought back with her from Korea a number of letters from British prisoners. In 1952, Mrs. Felton received a Stalin Peace Prize in moscow whence she again went to China and Korea, and visited Camp 5. Thereshe had the usual conducted tour, collected letters from prisoners and talked to,and had a meal with, the usual selected &quot; progressives.&quot; As one prisoner has said:&quot;Mrs. Felton visited the camp and took the progressives down to the village,
which made her even more unpopular with the anti-progressive personnel.&quot; Atalk by her on world peace and American aggression was recorded and subsequentlyplayed over the loudspeaker system of Camp 2 (Branch 1) early in 1953.CHAPTER vii the CAMPAIGN AGAINST&apos; RELATIVESThe efforts made by the Chinese to break down the morale of prisoners in korea found their echo in this country. Here the campaign by Communists and communist sympathisers was directed at relatives of the men in the war theatre,in a systematic drive to exploit their fears and hopes and doubts and thus to drawthem into the &quot; peace &quot; campaign through &quot; front&quot; organisations, Communist-inspired demonstrations and &quot; peace &quot; petitions.The manipulation of information about prisoners provided opportunities forblackmail too obvious to be neglected by the Communists. It was not until december 1951 fourteen months after they had entered the Korean war thatthe Chinese agreed to exchange lists of prisoners. It was only a month or two before then that they allowed prisoners in their hands to write their first lettershome. In the first phase of the Chinese intervention in Korea, therefore, relatives(and even the United Nations Command) were dependent upon information aboutprisoners supplied through such Communist channels as the London Daily Worker.That two correspondents of a paper published in Britain should be givenevery encouragement and facility in China and North Korea during the period ofhostilities is in itself a commentary on the nature of this war and the use thatthe Communists were making of it. They were often the first to reveal, througharticles published in the Daily Worker, that a particular British soldier, stillofficially posted as &quot; missing,&quot; was alive in enemy hands. The accounts wereenlivened by photographs of prisoners taken in the camps. The Daily Workercannot, perhaps, be altogether blamed for using this privileged access to information as a means of advertising itself. Free copies of the paper were sentto relatives, with an invitation to read it every day for regular news from Korea.But the privilege, after all, was accorded by the enemy in the field, and the object was not merely an increase in the Daily Worker^ circulation but the pursuit ofa calculated programme of indoctrination the same type of indoctrination,though different in degree, that filled the daily lives of the men in the north korean prison-camps. Besides the Daily Worker there were other publications,mostly produced in China, contributing to the campaign. From Peking the families of British prisoners received by post booklets containing the familiarCommunist pleas for &quot; peace &quot; and &quot; revelations &quot; of American atrocities.There was another point of similarity between the tactics of the Chinese inthe prison camps and those adopted by Communists and their helpers in Britain.Prisoners were expected not only to accept Communist &quot; truth&quot; but to workactively for their captors. Their relatives at home were asked not only to studyCommunist articles and reports in search of the information they longed for, butto enrol themselves in the &quot; peace &quot; campaign and assist the various activitiesconducted under its cover. Mrs. Monica Felton and the National Assembly ofWomen (under her chairmanship) figured prominently in these activities.The pattern of action as revealed by an investigation carried out by a journalistin the Leeds and Hull areas is typical of the whole country. * This investigationshowed that relatives of prisoners were subjected to a steady barrage of propagandadesigned to play upon their natural fears and desire to help their men in Korea.One mother was constantly visited by two women on behalf of the national assembly of Women. &quot; They asked me to go to a meeting in London last March(1953),&quot; she said. &quot; I told them I could not afford to go, but then they said theywould pay my fare. I had never been to London and so I thought it was a good chance. There was a meeting in the Conway Hall, Red Lion Square, but when got there it seemed to be Communist and anti-British talk and I wasn&apos;t&apos;t happyabout it. Then we had a procession to the House of Commons and I had tocarry a banner reading: &apos; Bring back our lads from Korea.&apos; I felt rather ashamedand tried to hide it down by my side.&quot;* It was published in the Yorkshire Post on August 14, 1953.
Another mother, who had one son killed in Korea and another taken prisoner,regularly received leaflets. &quot; How many more sons have you got for themillionaires&apos; fishing pool? &quot; asked one in large red lettering. It was put throughher door with a copy of the Daily Worker. After the son who was later reportedkilled was first reported missing, she was visited by a woman from London whoasked her to speak at a meeting there. &quot; I told her I couldn&apos;t&apos;t afford it,&quot; shereported, &quot; so she said they would pay all expenses. I have been having regularvisits from two women in Leeds who are representatives of the National Assemblyof Women, and from some people in Liverpool I don&apos;t know who they are.&quot; One day one of these women came and asked me to go to a meeting at thehouse of another mother with a boy in a prisoner-of-war camp. I was worriedto death about my other son because I had&apos;t heard from him, and thought I might get some news of him, so I went. I took these awful leaflets Fd been getting one of them said: &apos; How many more sons have you got to be killed in Korea? &apos;-and started complaining about them at the meeting. Then a woman next tome said &apos; sssh&apos; and looked nervous, and that was when I realised they wereCommunists. They elected me to be a speaker at a demonstration in Londonlast year, but I said I couldn&apos;t&apos;t go.&quot; I know that some women who have been going to these meetings have beenhaving regular news from their boys. But it was 19 months before I heard from my son, apart from a brief note to say he was a P.O.W. I was told it was probablybecause he was refusing to co-operate with the Reds.&quot;Another Leeds mother, whose son was a prisoner, received visits from twowomen and letters from the National Assembly of Women, saying how the men should be brought back from Korea. She said: &quot; The women persuaded me togo to the demonstration in London (in March 1953). Mrs. Monica Felton wasspeaking, and they told me that she had visited my boy&apos;s camp in Korea andmight have news for me. So I went. But I sat at the back of the hall, and didn&apos;thear a word.  They paid my fare to London and back.&quot;The parallel between the tactics of the Chinese and those adopted byCommunists and Communist sympathisers in this country can be taken a stage further. As the writing and issue of mail in North Korea was regulated in anattempt to induce co-operation, so were letters from prisoners used to enlist thesupport of relatives for Communist aims.As one of the few British people allowed by the Chinese to visit the prisoncamps, Mrs. Felton could act as a link between prisoners and relatives by bringingout mail which was suitably worded. She made the most of her opportunities.After one of her visits to North Korea she brought back to Britain over 150 letters from prisoners, which she forwarded, together with an appeal on the notepaperof the National Assembly of Women to relatives to join in the Communist &quot; peace &quot;campaign.   Here is an extract from this covering letter:  I need hardly tell you that your husband is longing to get homeagain. Many of the P.O.W.s asked me what was being done by the ordinarypeople of this country to help speed up the end of the war and to hasten theexchange of prisoners. I was able to tell them how the National Assemblyof Women, of which I am Chairman, helped to organise the groups of relativesof P.O.W.s who lobbied Members of Parliament on 1st June, and I also told them about the work of various peace organisations in this country.&quot; Again and again they asked me to urge their families and friends totake some active part in the movement for peace in their own localities, andso I am taking this opportunity of passing on the message to you. If you would like my assistance in getting in touch with organisations in your ownlocality that are working for peace I hope you will let me know and I shallbe very glad to help you.&quot; As you know, there are also British P.O.W.s in other camps, which Iwas not able to visit, and it would be, I know, a great comfort to the relativesand friends of those men if they could hear what is happening to others. I myself will be speaking and writing about my own experience and if you feltthat you could let me have, a copy of the letter I am sending to you and would allow me to quote from it in my speeches, it would be, I am certain, a greatconsolation to those in this country who have not received mail for sometime. ...&quot;. The most obvious aim of this covering letter was to induce relatives to workfor a Communist &quot; peace.&quot; But there was another object, whose real significance
would not have been immediately apparent to the anxious recipients. It is hiddenin the request for copies of letters contained in the last paragraph. In the lettersthey gave to Mrs. Felton for forwarding, prisoners, for varying motives, usuallyincluded suitable phrases about the good treatment they were receiving and theaggressive policies of the United States. Such propaganda material was not to beallowed to go to waste.So far as is known the relatives of officers and senior N.C.O.s were not personally approached though they did receive propaganda booklets through thepost. Almost every officer and senior N.C.O. in captivity was classed by theChinese as a &quot; reactionary.&quot; From this the Communists may have concluded thattheir families at home would resist the attentions of propagandists and might maketrouble if they were harassed.The degree of success achieved with prisoners&apos; families is impossible to assess.When the prisoner returned with anti-Communist or anti-Chinese views he was undoubtedly able to disillusion his family and friends swiftly and effectively; inother cases a prisoner may have come home with &quot; progressive &quot; sentiments to find that, by similar methods, his family had been imbued with a similar outlook.Whatever the result, it is the campaign itself which is significant.CHAPTER viii the PRISONERS-OF-WAR convention a good deal was heard during the Korean War of the Prisoners-of-war convention of 1949, drawn up at Geneva by an international conference which included delegates from the Soviet Union and most of the satellite countries. ThisConvention did not apply de jure to the combatants in the Korean War, but it was reasonable to regard it as having set civilised standards which should be recognised by both sides. Both the United Nations Command and the North Koreansdeclared that they intended to apply the Convention de facto in their treatment ofwar prisoners.The Chinese also claimed from time to time that they were abiding by theprovisions of the Convention. On the other hand they represented their own&quot; Lenient Policy,&quot; described in previous chapters, as much superior to the Prisoners-of-War Convention. The Convention was a &quot; product of bourgeois capitalistStates &quot; (though in fact the Soviet Union and some of the satellite States helped to draw it up and have subsequently ratified it) and &quot; contradicts their actions.&quot;The Chinese, we were told, do not hold under Communist leadership &quot; with anyoppression of common peoples.&quot; Prisoners of war were common people who hadbeen duped by their reactionary governments. Those who did not recognise the&quot; truth &quot; of this assertion and argued that they were entitled to the provisions of theConvention were sharply told that they were &quot; war criminals &quot; and entitled to nothing except shooting. For referring to the Convention men were struck,threatened and made to stand to attention for long periods. Yet even while theywere being so treated they had to listen to accusations of American aggression,American atrocities, American contravention of the very Convention to which the prisoners were not allowed to appeal or refer.With the negotiations for an armistice a new situation developed in which itsuited Chinese policy to play up the Prisoners-of-War Convention and to call for itsformal acceptance by the United Nations. This propaganda campaign wasoccasioned by the question of the voluntary repatriation of prisoners, which wasproving a major stumbling-block in the negotiations. It moved the Chinese to repeat their pretension to have been observing the principles of the Convention, butit also forced them to expose what lay behind that pretension. It was the ChinesePrime Minister, Chou En-lai, who on July 13, 1953, stated publicly that although his Government recognised the Convention it made a number of exceptions. Oneof these was to the effect that &quot; prisoners of war who have been convicted as war criminals .... shall not be entitled to the benefits of the Convention.&quot;It must be explained that reservation in similar terms had been made by theSoviet Union and other Communist Governments which signed the Convention.But the Chinese in Korea, by simply maintaining that all soldiers fighting for their&quot;bourgeois&quot; or &quot;imperialist&quot; opponents were, ipso facto, &quot;war criminals,&quot;
succeeded to their own satisfaction in justifying their complete disregard of theConvention. One prisoner was told by a Chinese interrogator that the Prisoner-of-War Convention was fully observed by the Chinese, &quot; but only after the prisonerhad reached a stage of full repentance for his past crimes.&quot; Fighting against theChinese was the most heinous of these crimes.In fact the Chinese disregard for the Convention, as demonstrated in the account already given, was both general and specific. Article 16, for instance,prohibits discrimination against prisoners of war on account of their politicalopinions. The Chinese theory of treatment of prisoners was based entirely ondiscriminating between &quot; progressives &quot; and &quot; reactionaries.&quot; Article 87 providesthat&quot; collective punishment for individual acts, corporal punishment, imprisonmentin premises without daylight and, in general, any form of cruelty or torture areforbidden.&quot; The facts set out in Chapter V show how the Chinese flouted that provision.In matters of religion, again, the Convention preserves certain rights for prisoners of war. Article 34 says that prisoners &quot; shall enjoy complete latitude inthe exercise of their religious duties, including attendance at the service of theirfaith.&quot; The next article, 35, states that &quot; chaplains who fall into the hands of theenemy Power .... shall be allowed to minister to them (prisoners) and toexercise freely their ministry among prisoners of war of the same religion.&quot; Howdid the Chinese regard these articles ?In the first established prisoner-of-war camp, Camp 5, there were in 1951three American chaplains. Two died within a short time. The third was forbidden to take part in any religious activity, was not permitted to hold services, to visit the sick and dying, bury the dead, or have any contact with prisoners outside hisown compound. Nevertheless, he did hold services and even maintainedsurreptitious contact with prisoners in other companies. Branded by the Chineseas a secret agent, a trouble maker, and a reactionary element he was refused allmedical attention when he fell ill, and he died in the summer of 1951.On his death, religious activities were carried on by the prisoners themselves,among them a British major of the Royal Ulster Rifles, who had previously beenthreatened with death for reading the burial service over men who died on the march north to the camp.When the Panmunjon peace talks opened the Chinese began to allow religiousservices, but their degree of tolerance fluctuated with the progress made at the talks, as is shown by the experience of the Rev. S. J. Davies, chaplain to theGloucesters, and the only chaplain of the United Nations forces who survivedimprisonment in Chinese &quot;hands.Captured in the spring of 1951, Padre Davies did not arrive at a recognisedprisoner-of-war camp (Camp 2) until October of that year. By then the Chinesewere allowing religious services and he took over the Protestant ones from the ulster Rifles Major. For a time Chinese interference was limited to censorship ofthe order of service and to demands for accounts of the religious duties fulfilled bythe prisoners. But this tolerance did not last long. In February, 1952, PadreDavies was forbidden to visit the sick, and he was in trouble for allowing &quot; GodSave The King &quot; and the &quot; Star Spangled Banner &quot; to be sung after the EasterSunday service. He was not allowed to visit officers in solitary confinement; suchvisits were &quot; not necessary.&quot; The services he held in the middle of the week werebanned even though the Chinese had allowed them for six months. They werebranded as &quot; illegal political activity.&quot; His choir practices were stopped; so werethe Monday evening services for cooks, and all religious instruction classes. Hiscaptors continued to insist that there was freedom of religion in the camps but,they argued, since Sunday was the &quot; holy day &quot; for Christians, they were confiningreligious activities to that day. Any counter-argument was punishable as slanderof the Chinese forces.The Chinese gradually increased their pressure on Padre Davies, and from themiddle of 1952 until his release in September of the following year he underwenta long series of threatening interrogations and an 18-day period of solitaryconfinement.It goes without saying that Padre Davies was never permitted to visit prisoners in other camps. In spite of this, in most of the camps, various British soldiersrisked their lives to conduct religious services. In one camp a service was evenheld on Coronation Day, though the Chinese had forbidden this type of&quot; reactionary political activity.&quot;
Such was Chinese policy where religion was concerned. Their attitude to theInternational Red Cross was equally hostile. They refused to allow a Red CrossDelegation to visit the camps in North Korea, even though this refusal did theircause harm throughout the world and made their propaganda about the conditionsin the prisoner-of-war camps suspect. The Chinese claimed (in the words of aChinese camp interrogator) that the International Red Cross was a &quot; capitalistspy organisation which used its special privileges as a cover for entering enemy-heldterritory for the purpose of obtaining strategic intelligence.&quot; These words wereechoed by the Commander of Camp 2, when he said that the International red cross &quot; is an imperialist organisation and no longer a humanitarian one at all.&quot; In1952 the Chinese and other Communist Delegations to the International Red CrossConference in Toronto used similar language.Under the Armistice Agreement a joint team from the International red cross and the Chinese and North Korean Red Cross Organisations was finallyallowed to visit the camps in North Korea, but the visit was a farce. The prisoners were not permitted to see members of the Delegation without a Chinese being present, and both the questions asked by the Delegation and the answers given bythe prisoners were censored. Furthermore, officers and sergeants were not seenat all because they were moved to Kaisong two weeks ahead of schedule as a preliminary to being exchanged. Although two prisoners were taken to an interview with the delegates to show that this move had not been made to prevent a meeting with the Red Cross party, the two prisoners were told that they wouldnot be repatriated if they did not give the answers supplied to them by the Chinese.conclusion in the two and a half years during which they fought in Korea the Chinese usedevery device, from moral pressure to physical torture, to convert the prisonersthey captured to the Communist viewpoint and to use them to further Communistaims. These tactics were not hastily devised; they were the result of a generation of experience in dealing with captured soldiers of the Kuomintang. In Chinatheir success had been considerable; but it was in North Korea that they were applied for the first time to western prisoners, and the question inevitably arises:How did their success with British soldiers compare with their earlier success insideChina?  To what extent did British soldiers accept Communist teachings?Officers and senior N.C.O.s (who made up about 12 per cent, of the totalof British soldiers captured by the Chinese) remained almost completely unafftcted by Communist propaganda and were segregated from the remainder, while amongthe junior N.C.O.s and Other Ranks some two-thirds remained virtually unaffected.Of the remainder, most absorbed sufficient indoctrination to be classed asCommunist sympathisers, but have most likely responded to the influence of normal home life. A small minority about 40 altogether returned homeconvinced Communists. But some had Communist leanings or affiliations before they went to Korea.Viewed in the light of the resources at their disposal the success of the Chinesemay be considered comparatively small. In reality it may be less than is at firstapparent, for there were many reasons which had nothing to do with politicalconvictions that made a prisoner appear &quot; progressive.&quot;In the winter of 1950-51 material conditions in the prison camps were such that many prisoners gave politically &quot; correct &quot; answers so that they might enjoy,if not better conditions, at least a sporting chance of staying alive. And that the&quot; right&quot; answer was often vital to life is emphasised by the case of the Americanofficer who, because he described a question as &quot; not worth the paper it is written on,&quot; was accused of having a hostile attitude and slandering the Chinese paper-manufacturing industry. The treatment which he received in the resulting periodof solitary confinement was the direct cause of his death.As the war continued opportunities for simulated &quot; progressiveness &quot; increased and a number of prisoners succumbed to the promise of more cigarettes, moreand better food, and medical treatment, in exchange for their signature on a&quot; peace&quot; petition or an address to the United Nations. Some posed as&quot; progressives &quot; in the hope that they would receive more letters; others appearedto co-operate so that they could keep an eye on those who voluntarily assistedthe Chinese or as a cover for other activities; still others saw the &quot; truth &quot; afterbrutal treatment.
But in the pretence of &quot; progressive &quot; sentiments there was danger, and anumber of prisoners discovered that, through the continuous repetition of theCommunist creed, they unconsciously assimilated Communist thoughts and views,and so gradually became sympathisers to varying degrees. In addition, therewere, of course, genuine conversions, which were not based initially on a facadeof &quot; progressiveness,&quot; but the total was very small.Appendix IMain Camps in North Korea in which British Troops were held PrisonerCamp 1At Chongsong, about 50 miles north-east of Sinuiju.

Eventually herejoined a large group of prisoners being marched north to prison camps and,despite the hardships of this march, which lasted a month, rapidly emerged as aman of outstanding leadership and very high morale.In July 1952, Fusilier Kinne, who was by now well known to his captors, wasaccused by them of being non-co-operative and was brutally interrogated about theother prisoners of war who had unco-operative views. As a result of his refusal to inform on his comrades, and for striking back at a Chinese officer who assaultedhim, he was twice severely beaten-up and tied up for periods of 12 and 24 hours,being made to stand on tip-toe with a running noose round his neck which wouldthrottle him if he attempted to relax in any way.He escaped on July 27 but was recaptured two days later. He was againbeaten up very severely and placed in handcuffs (which could be and frequentlywere tightened so as to restrict circulation), from which he was not released until october 16, 1952, a period of 81 days.He was accused of insincerity, a hostile attitude towards the Chinese,&quot; sabotage &quot; of compulsory political study, escape, and of being reactionary. Fromthe 15th to the 20th August he was confined in a very small box cell, where he wasmade to sit to attention all day, being periodically beaten, prodded with bayonets,kicked and spat upon by the guards, and denied any washing facilities.On August 20, 1952, he was made to stand to attention for seven hours andwhen he complained was beaten by the Chinese guard commander with the butt of a sub-machine gun, which eventually went off and killed the guard commander.For this Fusilier Kinne was beaten senseless with belts and bayonets, strippedof his clothes, and thrown into a dank rat-infested hole until the 19th September.He was frequently taken out and beaten, including once (on September 16), withpieces of planking until he was unconscious.On October 16 Fusilier Kinne was tried by a Chinese military court for escapeand for being a reactionary and hostile to the Chinese, and was sentenced to twelvemonths solitary confinement. This was increased to eighteen months when hecomplained at his trial of denial of medical attention, including that for a severedouble hernia which he had sustained in June 1952, while training to escape.On December 5, 1952, he was transferred to a special penal company. his last award of solitary confinement was on June 2, 1953, when he was sentencedfor defying Chinese orders and wearing a rosette in celebration of Coronation Day.He was eventually exchanged at Panmunjom on August 10, 1953. As late asthe 8th and 9th August he was threatened with non-repatriation for demandingan interview with the International Red Cross Representatives who were visitingPrisoner-of-War camps.Fusilier Kinne was during the course of his periods of solitary confinementkept in no less than seven different places of imprisonment, including a securitypolice gaol, under conditions of the most extreme degradation and increasingbrutality. Every possible method both physical and mental was employed by hiscaptors to break his spirit, a task which proved utterly beyond their powers.Latterly he must have been fully aware that every time he flaunted his captorsand showed openly his detestation of themselves and their methods he was riskinghis life. He was in fact several times threatened with death or non-repatriation.Neverthless he was always determined to show that he was prepared neither to beintimidated nor cowed by brutal treatment at the hands of a barbarous enemy.His powers of resistance and his determination to oppose and fight the enemy to the maximum were beyond praise. His example was an inspiration to all rankswho came into contact with him.George CrossLieutenant Terrence Edward Waters (463718), (deceased), The West YorkshireRegiment, (The Prince of Wales&apos;s Own), attached The GloucestershireRegiment.Lieutenant Waters was captured subsequent to the Battle of the Imjin River,April 22-25, 1951. By this time he had sustained a serious wound in the top ofthe head and yet another most painful wound in the arm as a result of this action.
On the journey to Pyongyang with other captives, he set a magnificent example of courage and fortitude in remaining with wounded other ranks on the march,whom he felt it his duty to care for to the best of his ability.Subsequently, after a journey of immense hardship and privation, the partyarrived at an area west of Pyongyang adjacent to P.W. Camp 12 and knowngenerally as &quot; The Caves &quot; in which they were held captive. They found themselvesimprisoned in a tunnel driven into the side of a hill through which a stream ofwater flowed continuously, flooding a great deal of the floor, in which were packeda great number of South Korean and European prisoners of war in rags, filthy,crawling with lice. In this cavern a number died daily from wounds, sickness, ormerely malnutrition: they fed on two small meals of boiled maize daily. of medical attention there was none.Lieutenant Waters appreciated that few, if any, of his numbers would survivethese conditions, in view of their weakness and the absolute lack of attention fortheir wounds. After a visit from a North Korean Political Officer, who attempted to persuade them to volunteer to join a prisoner-of-war group known as &quot; PeaceFighters &quot; (that is, active participants in the propaganda movement against theirown side) with a promise of better food, of medical treatment and other amenitiesas a reward for such activity an offer that was refused unanimously he decidedto order his men to pretend to accede to the offer in an effort to save their lives.This he did, giving the necessary instructions to the senior other rank with theBritish party, Sergeant Hoper, that the men would go upon his order without fail.Whilst realising that this act would save the lives of his party, he refused togo himself, aware that the task of maintaining British prestige was vested in him.Realising that they had failed to subvert an officer with the British party, theNorth Koreans now made a series of concerted efforts to persuade LieutenantWaters to save himself by joining the camp. This he steadfastly refused to do. Hedied a short time after.He was a young, inexperienced officer, comparatively recently commissionedfrom the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, yet he set an example of the highestgallantry.Awarded the George MedalCaptain Acton Henry Gordon Gibbon (304047), Royal Regiment of Artillery.This officer, whilst undergoing interrogation by North Korean securitypersonnel at the notorious camp &quot; Pak&apos;s Death House,&quot; north of Pyongyang, wasinstrumental in assisting an escape of three other prisoners of war. As a resultof this the North Korean Commander of the camp, Major Pak, subjected CaptainGibbon to ill-treatment tantamount to torture in an endeavour to obtain the route and the plans of the escape party. Captain Gibbon was hung from a tree by arope fastened round his wrists which were bound behind his back, and subjected to beating and kickings for many hours. In addition to this he was threatened with a pistol and subjected to various other forms of ill-treatment. He withstoodall this ill-treatment so much so that Major Pak considered that he obviouslycould not impart the information they required, as he did not know it. CaptainGibbon&apos;s conduct and courage during this time was an inspiration to all others inthe camp.
