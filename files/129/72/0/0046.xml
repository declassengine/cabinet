There appears to have been no difficulty in either case aboutsecuring the return of the men.H. M.Ministry of Defence, S.W. 1,16th December, 1954.SUMMARYEast BerlinOn 20th November, 1954, five soldiers of the Manchester Regiment were under detention for various reasons in the Town Guard Room, Berlin. Thesefive soldiers, with five other prisoners, were taken from their cells at about 8 p.m.by a corporal for the purpose of having showers in the nearby barracks. during their showers the corporaFs attention was distracted and the five men escapedthrough a window.2. The men were seen to cross into the Russian zone from the British sectorat 10 a.m. ort 21st November. The military authorities consider as a result of preliminary interrogation that the men had no intention of crossing but did so inerror when trying to avoid capture by a military policeman.3. Two other soldiers of the Manchester Regiment also crossed into theRussian zone on 21st November. It appears that they got very drunk, and at a.m. decided to give themselves up to the Russians rather than return to barracks and be punished for absence. They crossed into the Russian zone from the Frenchsector.   When sober they regretted their decision and asked to return.4. A British request for the return of these seven men was made in the routine way by the military authorities through military liaison channels. TheSoviet military authorities replied on 26th November that the case would be dealtwith through the Commandant of the Soviet sector in Berlin. Five of the soldierswere returned on 26th November and the remaining two the following day. all our people in Berlin had to do was to fetch the men when the Russians askedthem to do so.Hong Kong5.
