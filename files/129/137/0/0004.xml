J. C.Home Office, S. W. 1.23rd May, 1968
Appendix AAs invited by the Cabinet at their meeting on 22nd February(CC(68) 14th Conclusions, Minute 6) the Sub-Committee of the HomeAffairs Committee on Electoral Reform have considered all theconclusions in the Final Report of the Speaker&apos;-^ Conference on electoral law (Cmnd. 3550) and various conclusions on the machinery for conductir.Parliamentary elections reached by the Electoral Advisory Conference.2.      There are six major or controversial issues which were eitherdecided by the Speaker&apos;s Conference on a vote, or to which theSub-Committee would draw special attention.    They are as follows -(i) Minimum age for voting.(ii) Frequency of publishing and cost of the electoral register.(iii) Public opinion polls and betting odds.(iv) Broadcasting,(v) Hours of poll.(vi) Party labels on ballot papers.These are discussed in Annex 1 to this memorandum.    Annex 2summarises the recommendations of the Sub-Committee on all theconclusions of the SpeakerTs Conference (items 1 to 71) and of the electoral Advisory Conference (items 72 to 111).3. The Sub-Committee disagree entirely with the following conclusions of the Conference or think that they call for further examination or consultation (numbers are those in Annex 2);-1-

Many of the recommendations of me Conferences suggest no changein the present law and some others could be given effect without legislation, but, as will be seen from the preceding paragraph, not all of the recommendations have been accepted by the Sub-Committee.Subject to that, legislation or subordinate legislation is required to giveeffect &quot;-o the following recommendations; 1-3, 6, 7, 9, 3.1-17, -21-25,28-30, 32, 35, 37, 55, 60, 62, 68, 70, 72, 75-77, 79-81, 83-85, 88-95,99-103, 105-107, 109-111.5.      To complete the review of the electoral law, conferences havebeen held with the national agents of the political parties, the localauthority associations and the societies of clerks of local governmentauthorities on a number of questions relating to local governmentelectoral law in England and Wales, arid in Scotland.    These questions will come before the Sub-Committee shortly.6.      H a Bill were to be introduced next Session and received RoyalAs sen- in July, 1969, the need for affirmative resolution regulations andpreparatory work in electoral registration offices would mean that theearliest time for an election on a new-style register prepared under theBill would be the spring of 1971.    i  there were to be an autumn-registerin addition to the spring register (and on grounds of cost the Sub-committee recommended against this) the first time for an election on the new-styleregister would be the autumn of 1970.    Most of the provisions of the bill that did not relate to the register could come into force more or less atonce.    If, however, the Bill received Royal Assent early in the 1968-69Session so as to allow Parliament to approve regulations by the end ofMay^ 1969, then the first election on a new-style register could be heldin the spring of 1970, provided that advance authority could be given forthe printing of about 20 million forms.    The view of the Sub-Committeeis that if there is to be a change in the age of voting a Representation ofthe People Bill is essential for 1968-69, despite the somewhat precarioustiming.    It would be impossible to defend a situation in which parliament decided to reduce the voting age, without operating thatdecision at the ensuing election.-2
7,       i Invite my colleagues to consider the recommendations of theSub&quot;Committee in order that the Governments attitude on the various proposals for electoral reform may be stated in the debate to be arrangedon the report of the SpeakerTs Conference.    It would also be desirable for the conclusions of the Electoral Advisory Conference to be published as a Command Paper so as to facilitate the debate.    i am arranging forthis to be done.
7 9o z.ANNEX iMAJOR OR CONTROVERSIAL ISSUESMinimum age for votingThe Speaker&apos;s Conference recommended by a majority of 21+to 1 that the age for voting should be reduced to 20, after having rejected by 22 votes to 1 a motion that the  ageshould be reduced to 18.     There are three possible courses -(a) to leave the age at 21;(b) tQ reduce the age to 18, as suggested in the representations submitted to the Speaker&apos;s conference by the Labour Party;    or(c) to reduce the age to 20, as recommended by the speaker&apos;s Conference.2,    Course (a) is not practicable.     The arguments insupport of (b) are those which were put forward in LabourParty evidence to the Speaker&apos;s Conference.     They are that many of the obligations of adult status arise at 18, thatyoung people mature at an earlier age, that they are well\ informed and would inject a new vigour into politics;   andthat this franchise would give young people a greater sensej of responsibility.     These arguments have now been stronglyreinforced by the public acceptance by the Government of theLatey Committee recommendation that the age of majority shouldbe reduced to 18 for all other purposes.3.    The conclusion of the Speaker&apos;s Conference that the age for voting should be reduced to 20 was passed by a substantial majority and carries much weight.     Nevertheless, it is theview of the Sub-Committee that it would be illogical on theone hand to ge along with the cautious approach of the SpeakerfsConference while on the other hand accepting the view of theLatey Committee that for all other purposes adult statusshould begin at 18.     Merely to make a reduction to 20 would leave the Government of the day with the duty of keeping thematter under constant review until the voting age was eventuallyreduced to 18.     The Sub-Committee consider that it weuld bebetter to take a decision which is consistent in all fieldsand to reduce the voting age to 18 in accordance with theview^expressed in the Labour Party Manifesto for the 1966 generalelection that it &quot;would add a necessary political dimensionto the increasing important economic and social position of young people&quot;&apos;,4.    Members of the public will find it difficult to understand why the Speaker&apos;s Conference reached a conclusion inconsistent with that of the Latey Committee,     It would not be easypublicly to explain the distinction between the franchise andthe matters in the private and personal field (marriage,consent to marriage, wardship, property and contracts) that were the concern of the Latey Committee.     In Daragraph 25oi their Report (Cmnd. 33h2) the Latey Committee said thaton the subject of voting they had carefully refused toexpress a view, and went on to say, &quot;But it does not seem tous that changes in the civic field are at all likely to followqh?J5 111 the Private field even if we wished that theysnould .     The Committee were considering fields in whicha minimum age of 21 could cause hardship in particular cases.
5      Any decision on the voting age must &quot;be an arbitrary one,and a decision to lower the voting age to 18 would probablybe irrevocable.     A reduction to 18 would widen the field for political pressures to be put on the student population;indeed, to reduce the age to 18 and implement the recommendation that young persons who come of age during the currency of a register should have their names included in the registerwith the date of their birthday, would mean that manyi7-year-olds would be on the register and some would be only16 years and 8 months of age when Form A was completed.6.    A further consideration is that a reduction of the voting age might also be followed by pressure to reduce from21 the age at which persons can stand for election to theHouse of Commons (Parliamentary Elections Act 1695).7.     To reduce the age for voting to 18 and implement therecommendation that young persons should be able to vote asfrom the date they reach that age would add about 3 millionelectors to the register and add to the cost of the register(over  3 million) about  526,000 in the first year and 212,000 each year thereafter.     To reduce the voting age to20 would add about 1-g- million electors to the register inthe first year and about 800,000 each year thereafter;    theadditional cost of registration is estimated at  211,000in the first year and  73,000 each year thereafter.8.     The age for voting is a major censtitutional issue and,as indicated by the voting in the Speaker&apos;s Conference, amatter of personal opinion.     The Sub-Committee suggesttherefore that, in the debate on the Speaker&apos;s ConferenceReport, the Government should announce its own view that theI age for voting should be reduced to 18 but that when it came to legislation they would be prepared to allow a free vote on this particular issue.Frequency of publishing and cost of the electoral register9.     By the casting vote of the Speaker, the Speaker&apos;s Conferencerecommended that there should continue to be one register eachyear.     The 1967 register for the United Kingdom cost a littleover  3 million.     About half the cost is now met by localauthorities, since the register is used for local government aswell as for parliamentary elections.     The Speaker&apos;s Conferencerightly rejected the idea of a supplementary register (conclusion in Annex B to the Report).     Since the only satisfactory way of securing a second register which is up to date is for it to be prepared on the basis of another complete canvass,a second register would double the cost of registration.There is little scope for financial saving in the preparation and publication of electoral registers.     On the contrary,the cost is likely to increase with the introduction of increasedpostal expenditure and a decision to lower the voting age.Computer and other techniques may in time save money but there is little prospect of savings in the short term.Except for elections to fill casual vacancies, an autumnregister would be of no use for local government elections.     Forthis reason local authorities would expect the Exchequer to meetthe whole cost of preparing and publishing it;    and their case would be strengthened if, as recommended by the Maud Committee onthe Management of Local Government, all types of local authorityelections were to be held triennially:    at present, all borough council elections outside London and many district councilelections are held annually.
H -..  When two registers were required under the Representationy  the People Act 19h9, the publication dates were -15th March, with a qualifying date of 20th November(1st December in Scotland), and1st October, with a qualifying date of 15th June.The Electoral Registers Act 19h9 abolished the autumn register;and the Electoral Registers Act 1953 brought forward the qualifying and publication dates, of the spring register to10th October and 15th February so as to allow a longer interval between publication and local government elections8     Thepreparation of a second register might have to take place, eitherduring the period of local government elections or in the early part of the holiday season.     It would mean more staff, andstudent labour would not be likely to be available for the canvassleading up to it.11A. The Sub-Committee consider that, while there are gotrdconstitutional reasons for keeping the register up to date, thecost in money and manpower of producing two registers each year&apos;s  out of proportion to the advantages it would bring.     Accordinglythey recommend acceptance wf the conclusion *f the Speaker&apos;conference, that there should continue to be one register eachyear.3
7 rPTOMbrtoijn -publication of results of public opinion rjolJ.s_.jaidvflfi betting odds for.iZ2 hour sa. before-. cio&apos;se.;:,oj*^.^ll12.   Since Parliamentary elections are usually held on a Thursdaythe effect of the recommendation would be to ban publication after9 p.m. on the previous Monday.     The arguments for the recommendedrestriction are -(a)    The publication of the results of an opinion poll andof betting odds might influence an uncertain electorto vote for the Party leading the poll.(ti)   The results of an opinion poll published on the eve ofthe poll could be misleading since they might relate toa poll conducted in the preceding week.(c) The publication of betting odds tends to bring theelection into disrepute.(d) There is something to be said for a &quot;quiet period&quot;before the poll.13.   On the other hand? there are the following strong arguments against the restriction -(e) There is no evidence that electors are influenced in theway suggested at (a):    it is possible that publicationmight have the result of rallying the Parties which arenot leading the poll.     A restriction would imply that people cannot be trusted with the vote.(f) It would be wrong for Parliament to determine what it isproper for electors to read in helping them to make up their minds how they should vote.(g) Merely restricting the publication of betting odds doesnot prohibit betting itself, and it is this, if carriedso far as to cause abuse, that would bring electionsinto disrepute.      It would be impracticable to preventbetting itself:    any statutory prohibition would be incapable of enforcement;    and in the absence of one,bookmakers could not be precluded from making known toprospective punters the odds they are prepared to offer.(h) The ban would not in itself produce a &quot;quiet period&quot;.Newspapers would continue to publish other politicalmaterial;    and comment on the results of a publicopinion poll published earlier could hardly be prevented.(i) Prohibition as from a prescribed time would not preventpublication a few moments before that time:    any objections that there may be to the publication of theresults of an opinion poll on the likely result of an election would not therefore be met unless the pollswere prohibited altogether.     But any prohibition could probably be circumvented by the publication of theresults of a poll on a different topic, for example, thepopularity of the Party leaders.gU,   Difficult practical questions would arise in framing theprovision.     It would for example be necessary to find a means ofsevering the publication of the results of a poll, which would beh
prohibited, from the puhlication of General statements orcomments on the state of public opinion, which could not.     Therewould be a choice between&apos;&quot;&apos;prohibiting reporting by United Kingdomnewspapers and broadcasting agencies alone, thus preventing themost&quot;widespread dissemination of the prescribed material;    and ofcasting the net wider to prevent all possibility of evasion, a difficult and elaborate enterprise.15.   The conclusion of the Sub-Committee is that the recommendation is not acceptable.     While it might be right to prohibit publicopinion polls because their accuracy and impartiality cannot beverified, and because people might be inclined to subscribe toapparent success as shown in the polls rather than make their ownjudgement, there is no effective way of suppressing polls orbetting odds completely.      If they are not published openly &quot;theresults could be &quot;leaked&quot;, or   be the subject of rumours whichcould be distorted.     Unless betting was prohibited altogetherpunters would have to be informed of the betting odds by ways otherthan broadcasting or publication in newspapers.B 2 d^J^Ji L.candidates16.   The Speaker&apos;s Conference recommended, subject to a proviso,that broadcasting should be exempted from the provisions aboutelection expenses.     These at present permit a programme in whichall the candidates at a particular election take part and are given  an equal opportunity to state their views.     The broadcasting authorities have also put on the arranged series of party political broadcasts;    these have been regarded as not offending againstsection 63 of the Representation of the People Act 1949 since the speakers broadcast on behalf of their parties and not in theparticular interests of themselves or of any other individualcandidates.     Nevertheless the possibility of the legality of aparticular programme of this kind being questioned, perhaps by wayof an election petition, cannot be dismissed and the matter shouldbe made clear.     The main cause of complaint by the broadcasting authorities is that, if all candidates at a particular electionare invited to take part in a programme and one declines, theprogramme cannot be put on.     Other difficulties under the present law are that a Minister who has responsibilities for a national policy and appears as such in a broadcast at the time of an electionmight run the risk of contravening section 63 if the othercandidates in his constituency do not appear;    and a person whoearns his living by broadcasting might also be regarded as securing an advantage if he continues with his work after he has announcedthat he intends to stand as a candidate.17.   These difficulties would be removed if the re-commentationswere accepted.     But the effect of simply exempting broadcasting-would be to leave the broadcasting authorities free to decide for themselves, as a matter of policy, what election broadcastingcould be put on;    the B.B.C. would be subject only to the requirement of impartiality secured by the Postmaster General&apos;sinjunction and the I.T.A. to that secured by the provisions of the television Act 196h.     It might be considered that this would givethe broadcasting authorities too great a measure of freedom, withinadequate safeguards to secure the impartiality of broadcastingor elections.     While general impartiality as between partiesmight^ be preserved, there might be considerable unfairness to individual candidates.     Nevertheless, subject to paragraph 18below, the Sub-Committee conclude that the recommendation shouldbe accepted.
18.   The effect of the proviso to the recommendation of the speaker&apos;s Conference would he that, though all the candidatesmust agree to take part, the programme could still go on if,for example, one of the candidates failed to arrive for the broadcast.     The Sub-Committee consider, however, that a programme should be permitted if all the candidates agreethat it can go on even if some of them do not desire totake part,19,   The conclusion of the Sub-Committee is therefore that therecommendation of the Speaker1 s Conference to exempt broadcastingfrom section 63 should be accepted, but that the second part of their recommendation on this matter should be modified so that broadcasts about particular constituencies could bemade without the participation of all the candidates,provided that those absent had been consulted and did not object.Hours of Poll20,   The Speaker&apos;s Conference recommended no change in thehours of poll (7 a,m. to 9 p.m.) at parliamentary elections.The Sub-Committee consider, however, that the evening is themost favoured time for voting and there would be advantage to the electors if the hours were extended to 10 p,m,:the people should be given the longest reasonable time inwhich to cast their votes.21,   Representative returning officers in England and wales have all warned of the serious disadvantages of any extensionand they see little advantage to be gained from it.     their experience is that by 9 p.m, the number of voters alreadydrops to a trickle, and no matter how late the closing hourmight be there will always be those who will want to vote atthe last possible moment.     The view of the Sub-Committeeis that with the increasing operation of the shift systemthere is a significant number of electors who would find itconvenient to v&amp;te up to 10 p,m, and that the situationvaries from constituency to constituency.     The disadvantageswhich are foreseen by returning officers are:-(a) It is difficult enough already, particularly in county constituencies where there are transportproblems, t** get staff to man the pollingstations from 6,30 a,m, to 9.30 p,m, (i.e, to getready to open at 7 a,m. and to clear up after 9 p.m.KAn extension could be the last straw,(b) The count is likely to be deferred to the next day in many more constituencies, particularly whereit is at present the practice to employ the pollingstation staff also for counting the votes at night.This is not likely to please the political parties.     There is also the problem of the securityof ballot papers overnight.     The   Sub-committee thought, however, that postponement of the countin many more constituencies would not necessarily be a bad thing.6
(c)    The cost of an election is hound to increase.Higher fees to presiding officers and poll clerkswill he necessary to induce them to do the job atall:   and the use of rooms and staff on a secondday&apos;to count the votes will cause inconvenience and cost moree     At present people who count the votesat night are hack at their normal jobs next morning,220   Sheriffs in Scotland, who are returning officers for parliamentary elections, in expressing similar views,have gone so far as to describe any extension as &quot;alarming&quot;,ana consider that it may even endanger the carrying throughof an election because of the difficulty of recruitingpresiding officers of the right calibre even with - as wouldseem inevitable - an increase in the fees payable,23,   These are serious objections and they would be more serious if a 10 p,m, closing time applied also at local elections.     However, that is not in question, and Parliamentaryelecticns are held infrequently.     The Sub-Committee considerthat administrative difficulties should not be allowed tjprevail over the principle of affording the longest reasonable time for people to exercise their rights.Party Labels on Ballot Papers2iu   The terms of reference of the Speaker&apos;s Conference wererestricted to parliamentary elections.     Their conclusionzibt to change the law which prohibits party labels on nominationand ballot papers has been supported by the ElectoralAdvisory Conference and by the conferences on local government elections law.25.   The question of deciding whether the claim of a candidate1 to represent a particular party was genuine could prevokecontroversy.     One method of relieving the returning officerof the responsibility of deciding the claim of a candidateto represent a particular party might be to adept a system on the lines of that in use in the Irish Republic wherebya party candidate must deliver with his nomination paper acertificate of political affiliation signed by the authorisedofficer of his party, whose name would have been given in: the register of political parties circulated to returning officers before the election.     This would appear to givethe Parties more influence than they have at present.     If a register of political parties was set up here, there wouldhave to be some independent body to maintain it.     time would also be needed before elections, particularly localgovernment elections, for the registration body to circulateup-to-date information, including last-minute changes in the authorised officers, in respect of every organisationcontesting elections - a pretty formidable task especially at local government elections, where the problems about partyaffiliation are greatest,26,   in Australia, where parties are not registered, thearrangement for multi-member elections to the Senate issimply that the names of candidates can be grouped togetherif the candidates so desire,     Clearly the arrangement wouldappropriate only for elections in multi-member local governmentelectoral areas.     if it was thought that the Australiansystem merited further consideration in connection with suchejections, then it would be necessary to consult the interested bodies concerned.
7 Q0 y27     In New Zealand, whore more candidates than the numberof*seats to be contested claim to be candidates of the samebarty, the returning officer has to find out who are the authorised party candidates and then ask the other candidatesto change the name of their &quot;claimed party&quot;.     This is thenoint at which the returning officer can become involved incontroversy.     For this reason it might be considered thatthe system would not be acceptable:    in New Zealand it is not used for local government elections where a variety of interests contest the elections.28,   The other alternative course is for a notice giving the names of the candidates and their party affiliation to beplaced in each polling booth, as is done in New Zealand.But here also the returning officer would become involvedin political matters if more candidates than there are seats to be filled claim to represent the same party.29.   A scheme for the registration of political parties andassociations might be possible to deal with the relatively small number of parties which contest parliamentary elections,though there would be difficulties, for example, in the caseof a candidate who wanted to stand as an independent memberof one of the main parties, or as a candidate for more thanone Party.     It would also be necessary to consider what sort of organisations could get registered under such a scheme.For example, ought religious denominations to be excluded?A scheme of registration might not be practicable for thegreat number of associations, e.g, local ratepayers&apos; andtenants&apos; associations, which contest local government elections.Such associations are run mainly by voluntary workers andthere would be a large turnover in the &quot;authorised officers&quot;whose signature would be necessary on a certificate accompanyinga nomination paper, and also in the officers who would beresponsible for telling the returning officers the name ofthe authorised officer in each locality.     Moreover, the registration of, say, the National Union of Ratepayers&apos;Associations would hardly be good enough for a candidatewho wanted to show on the ballot paper the name of, say,the Epsom Court V7ard Ratepayers&apos; Association.     In practice it might happen that nomination papers at local government elections, particularly for the smaller authorities, wouldhave to be regarded as invalid because the voluntary workers of local associations had not conformed with the requirementsof the law,30.   Despite these difficulties the Sub-Committee considerthere is now a very strong constitutional case againstdenying the voter information about the Party to y/hich a candidate belongs.     Since British Parliamentary institutionsare now firmly based on a two Party system the voter iswell within his constitutional rights if he prefers to vote for the Party rather than for the man.     Since the Party isan essential part of our democratic system and since a GeneralElection is a means of choosing not merely an individual M.P.but a Government, the tradition by which the candidates mustbe considered without regard to Party affiliation is ananachronism.     The Sub-Committee recommends, therefore, that party affiliations should be made known in national elections and, if the administrative difficulties could be overcome,in local elections as well.     But before any conclusion isreached or announced contrary to the view taken by the Speaker&apos;conference, the opinion of the Parties would need to be tested.8

A second register wouldinvolve additional expenditure of about 3m. annually, and with increased postal charges and the introduction, nextSeptember, of the Post Office Range of postal matter the cost is likely to bemore.   There would also be an increasein cost if the age for voting were to bereduced.   Half the cost of an annualregister is met by local authoritiessince it is also used for local government elections in the spring, but localauthorities would expect the exchequer to meet the whole cost of an autumnregister.

The present law requires the appropriate government department toprovide an effective opportunity toservicemen to get themselves registered.
! conclusion of the Speaker&apos;s conference recommendation of the ministerial sub-Committee on Electoral ReformService authorities to &quot;be responsibleI for registration of Service wives when in the U.K.This is done by the regular issue of defence council Instructions.    commanding officers oould not be required to obtain information unless there was a requirementon the serviceman to supply it.

Appendix B\n     Following a meeting of the Cabinet on 2nd November, 1967 atwhich a memorandum &quot;by the Lord Chancellor (C( 67) I6h) on the Ageof Majority was considered, I undertook to bring before theHome Affairs Committee a memorandum on the Age of Voting.2.     Number of Persons affected the number of additional voters brought about by a reductionof the voting age from 21 to 13 would be about two-and-a-half million - an addition to the register of about &quot;&quot;(%*In considering the effective present voting age it has to beremembered that the fact that a vote is given by law at the age of21 does not normally mean that these young men and women can votejf there is an election the day after their 21st birthday.Firstly, there is always likely to be some time lag before their names can be placed on the electoral register.      Secondly, and moreimportant, the exercise of a voting right at a Parliamentaryelectron generally has to wait for a general election.     Even,therefore, if the minimum voting age were t o be reduced to 18, many persons would still not, in practice, exercise that right until they were 21.3-     Previous parliament,ajment::ca^.^j?^n^idejra;bionThe Representation of the People Act 1918 entitled servicemenwho had served in the war to vote at nineteen,     The Representationof the People Act 1920 enfranchised war-time ex-servicemen whowere still under twenty-one.The question of lowering the voting age was considered by the speaker&apos;s Conference on Electoral Reform of 19Uk when a resolution&quot;that the fianchise be extended to all those who have reached theage of eighteen&quot; was defeated by sixteen votes to three.During the Committee Stage of the Representation of the PeopleBill 19h8 amendments to lower the voting age were proposed by twoCommunist Members, but rejected by the Home Secretary, Mr. Ede.In November 1959, Mr. Emrys Hughes presented a Bill to reducethe voting age to eighteen, and this was debated on 19th February,1960, when it failed to ge b a Second Reading,^&apos;     Posit ion in 0 the r CountriesInformation on certain countries&apos; practice is set out inAppendix 7 to the Latey Committee Report.     A minimum voting ageof 21 is by far the most common.     The age is 18 in four States ofthe United States, in Ceylon, Argentine and most Eastern european nations.     In Japan the age is 20;    in the Netherlands 23.Isj few countries have other criteria;    for example, Brazil grantssuffrage at 18, but subject to the ability to write;   Peru at 21if literate;   Mexico normally at 21 but at 18 if married.
IFIESTKiCTED25.     Public Ooijrrijpj^Polls amongst young people as to whether they._are._invfavour of:, reduction-in voting- age: from&apos; 21 to d8Gallup Polls conducted a poll last year amongst 18-20 yearolds.     56?o of those questioned were in favour of a reduction ofthe voting age to 18;   30% disagreed j    \li% did not know.Polls of adults as to whether they are in favour of reduction : in voting age from 21 - to 18The general trend appears to be increasingly in favour of areduction.     In a 1954 Gallup Poll 63% disagreed with a reduction,and in a 1963 N.O.P. 61% were against;    but in November 1965 onlyk3% were against.     It seems clear, however,  that a substantially higher proportion of older people than the young are opposed to achange.     A breakdown in terms of age groups and party affiliationof the 1963 Survey is shown in the Annex.Voting preferences of Age^Group 18-20A 1965 Survey by Research Services in 1965 amongst18-20 year olds showed a 2:1 majority in favour of the LabourParty.     A 1967 random survey amongst 132 young people aged 18-20showed a somewhat lower majority (1x7% to 37%) and a Gallup Pollin August 1967 showed a still smaller majority (29% to 2lx%) .To what extent would the 18-20 age group actually voteThe Gallup Poll of August 1967 amongst young peoplerevealed 33% who said they would either not vote or did not knowwhether they would do so.     Research Services&apos;  enquiry of 1965shows that one-third of those questioned said that they had no party preference or leanings.,      The proportion of those actuallyvoting would also be affected by the speed with which young people were placed on the electoral register.I am not aware of any analysis that has been made of how these abstentions may be split between potential Labour andConservative voters.     The NoO.?. estimated in July 1967 that theeffect of lowering the voting age to 18 would increase Labour&apos;slead by 0.5%.^&apos;     Relationship with Latey Committee recommendations the age of voting was specifically excluded from the LateyCommittee&apos;s consideration.     In paragraph 25 of their Report they say &quot;And on the subject of voting we have carefully refused toexpress a view.     But it does not seem to us that changes in thecivic field are at all likely to follow changes in the privatefield even if we wished that they should&quot;.This disclaimer may be questioned,,     It seems likely that a lowering of the age of legal responsibility in such fields as thelaw of property and contractual capacity, and in the age at whichparental consent to marriage is required, as recommended by theppmmittee, would, if accepted, lead to increased pressure for achange in the voting age, particularly since the intangibleconsiderations regarding earlier maturity and sense ofresponsibility seem broadly similar in either case.
The Latey Report was debated in the House of Commons on20th November, and in the House of Lords on 22nd November,  1967^Jr the Commons the First Secretary said that the Governmentfound themselves in broad general sympathy with the recommendationsIff the Committee, including those which were not made unanimously,But only by a majority vote.     He emphasised that whilst the debatewur. essential] y a &quot;take-note&quot; debate, he did not think the house should be deterred by poll opinion from taking a lead in thesematters, particularly as regards the age when parental consent tomarriage was required and changes in the law of contract 0Generally speaking Members on the Government side were infavour of the Committee&apos;s recommendations,.     The Liberal speaker(Mr, Davidson) and the Scottish Nationalist also supported the^ commendations0     The view was taken by several Members that theconsideration of the Latey Committee&apos;s recommendations should not and could not be divorced from consideration of the voting age0fionservative speakers, on the other hand (Sir John Hob son andjr. Quintin Hogg), generally expressed doubts as to whether thecase for change had been made out, and pointed out that thereippeared to be little evidence of a demand for a change in the age.of majority,,     In answering the debate the Solicitor-General agreedthat as far as possible the recommendation of the Speaker&apos;conference should be synchronised and harmonised with theconclusions $peached about the appropriate age of legal majority.In the debate in the House of Lords the majority of thosetaking part were in favour of all the Committee&apos;s recommendationsShot only those made unanimously), ana the Lord Chancellor said he felt that general public opinion expressed outside Parliamentsince the publication of the Report also seemed to be favourable .The only major recommendation on which the  speakers seemed to beabout evenly divided was that relating to the reduction of thejge of marriage without parental consent, on which the debateprincipally focused.     Two speakers (Lord Henley and Lord Colville)drew attention to the inevitable links between the social andcivic ages of majority, whilst Lord Brooke took a middle course,supporting the unanimous recommendations of the Committee, butadvocating 20 as the age of majority as far as marriage was concerned.3
