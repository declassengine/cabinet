D iC(68) 79 COPY NO. _14th June, 1968CABINETTHE FULTON COMMITTEE REPORT ON THE CIVIL service note by the Prime minister circulate a copy of the Fulton Committee Report on the CivilService together v/ith a covering note by the Joint Permanent Secretaryto the Treasury and Official Head of the Home Civil Service.2.      If the Cabinet agree, I would propose in my statement to bemade to the House on the day of publication to announce the governments acceptance of all the main recommendations of the Report with particular reference to;-(i) the establishment of the Civil Service Department;(ii) the establishment of a Civil Service College; and(iii) the unified grading structure of the Service.3.     With regard to (iii) above I suggest the formula should be on thelines that the Government accept this in principle as an objective towardswhich they would work within the specific timetable which the committee epropose for its implementation; and that the necessary consultations with Staff Associations on this and other Issues raised by the Committeeshould begin immediately.4.      It would have to be made clear that those recommendations which involve substantial cost - and here I am thinking particularly of theproposals for pay and pensions - would have to be phased in over a periodof years in accordance with the requirements of the Governments public expenditure policy.    As is made clear in paragraph 6 of the attached paper:(a) The effect of the structure proposals on the pay bill, estimated to amount in the end to  5- 10 million, will not be felt at allbefore 1972.(b) The revised arrangements for pensions, costing eventually some 17 million, would have to be geared to the introduction of theState earnings-related scheme (planned for 1973) and this cost would build up gradually.-1-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYJS GOVERNMENT)
5.      I will inform Cabinet of my intentions with regard to Ministerialresponsibilities and the proposals for dealing with parliamentary questions.H.W.10 Downing Street, S. W.l.14th June, 1968- 2*
Attached is a copy of Volume I of the Fulton Committee Report onthe Civil Service.    There is a short summary of the main findingsafter Chapter Sj  and there is a full list of recommendations immediatelyafter the appendices at the end of the Report.2. The version circulated herewith is, so far as we know, the finalone; though the Committee have not yet formally signed it and intend todo so on 19th June.3.      I have discussed the report at a weekend conference ofPermanent Secretaries at which all the principal Departments v/ererepresented, and I am planning to discuss it with the leading membersof the professional Civil Service at a Conference on Saturday, 15th June.This memorandum reflects the views of the Permanent Secretaries;  if anything substantially different emerges from the conference with theprofessionals, I will report it immediately.4.      The main conclusions of the Report can be summarised asfollows:(a) A Civil Service Department should be created separate from and independent of the Treasury, absorbing the Civil service commission, with enlarged functions, under the control of thePrime Minister, assisted by another Minister who should bea member of the Cabinet.    There should be a similarenlargement of the functions of establishment divisions in deparments.(b) A Civil Service College should be established, to be the focusof a greatly expanded programme of Civil Service training and research.(c) A policy of recruitment, training and career management shouldbe adopted with the object of providing an open road to the topfor all kinds of talent - and in particular to ensure thatspecialists are given greater opportunities and training for undertaking managerial responsibilities, while administratorsdevelop greater expertise in the subject matter of their fields of activity, and in the techniques of policy formulation and management.(d) There should be introduced a unified grading structure over theCivil Service as a whole, in place of the present general and departmental classes.THE FULTON report memorandum by the Official Head of the Home Civil ServiceINTRODUCTION
(e) Departments should be reorganised, with the necessary changesin the system of Government accounting, to provide for longterm planning and for the fixing of objectives, for the achievement of which responsibility can be placed on individuals who can be held to account for the results achieved.(f) While the Civil Service should remain predominantly a careerservice, ways should be developed, including a reform of the pension system, for increasing the inflow and outflow at all levels,5.      The scheme of this memorandum is as follows:First, attention is drawn to the cost of the Committee^srecommendations, both in terms of increased numbers ofcivil servants and in terms of Exchequer expenditure, and ministers are invited to consider whether notwithstanding thecost, the reform should be proceeded with.Secondly, it is suggested, on the assumption that Ministers wishto proceed, that a general welcome should be given to the broadobjectives of the Report, as set out in the summary above,and that definite decisions should be announced on Items (a) and(b) above, and perhaps also on (d).    Thirdly,, reasons aregiven why the remaining recommendations require further study and consultation before decisions can be announced, though itis recommended that the study proposed by the Committee intothe methods of selection of candidates for the Civil service should be put in hand at once.Finally some comment is given on the criticisms of the CivilService contained in the Report.THE COST OF THE recommendations.      Details are given in the Appendix of the best estimate that can bemade, in the short time we have had to study the Report, of the likelyannual cost of the various recommendations, both in the immediate future and as the longer term recommendations come into effect.    This is of necessity little more than an informed guess at the present stage!  hut itcan be taken as certain that the total, both in terms of money and resources, will be substantial.    The various costs fall into two mainsections.    The first relate to a set of recommendations involving earlyexpenditure - including increased training, enlarged managerialactivities, the development of planning units and improvements in theworking environment.    It will be seen from Appendix II A that the costof these recommendations may be expected to build up to a sum of theorder of  11- 12 millions a year.    This will involve an increase in thenumbers of civil servants engaged on these activities - and they will be largely highly qualified civil servants - of the order of 3, 000 (there arealready indications that some Departments believe this to be anunderestimate).    Unless Ministers are prepared to accept costs of this order, we can hardly pretend that we are putting the Report into effect.The next set (Appendix II B) covers the necessarily highly speculativeestimate of the increases in pay which might follow from the introduction-2-
of the unified grading structure and the cost of the pension proposals.Even if it proves right to carry through both these sets of recommendations in full in their present form - and much further study is needed on both -the increased costs would not follow for some years and then would buildup slowly.    As far as the unified structure is concerned this would not,on the ComrnitteeTs own showing, come into effect for some five years,though the cost thereafter might prove substantial.    As far as pensions are concerned, changes would have to be related to the introduction ofthe State earnings-related pension scheme for which the presentplanning date is April, 1973.    Even if some parts of the changes inCivil Service superannuation took place earlier, it would in any event bea number of years before the full cost accrued, as retirements tookplace.    It might be towards the end of the decade before we reachedthe full annual rate of cost.7.      It is true that if the ComrnifcteeTs recommendations aresuccessfully implemented there is a. prospect of securing, in the end, amore efficient and more economical service.    This however v/ill take time to bring to fruition;  and we cannot say at this stage whether theresults, in terms of reduction in the numbers of civil servants as awhole, could be expected to offset the increases referred to above.What is certain, however, is that the increases must take place first,before any reductions as a result of the Report can be achieved.    Thiswill naturally give rise to criticism from those who think the CivilService is already too large, but it will have to be faced.8.      These circumstances naturally lead to the conclusion that efforts should be redoubled to find other ways of reducing the size of the CivilService.    Efforts to this end are being made continously by Departments,particularly since the introduction of the manpower ceiling at thebeginning of the current financial year; and I must report to ministers that my colleagues are coming under increasing difficulty in providingfor the maintenance of the services for which they are responsible underthe present ceilings.    While we have proposals which could lead to some reduction in numbers eventually, it is unlikely that they could be accomplished sufficiently quickly to make any difference in the current financial year, or much difference in the next.    We cannot, therefore,pretend that extra cost can quickly be matched by counter-balancingsavings, nor that much can be achieved without facing the cost;  topurport to be implementing the E.eport without extra staff and extra expenditure would soon be seen to be a sham.9.      If Ministers are prepared to accept the cost, then there are three major questions on which the Government may wish to take immediate decisions.The Civil Service Department10.      The first of these relates to the creation of the proposed CivilService Department, the expansion of its activities and the correspondingexpansion in the activities of Departments in the field of staffmanagement.    The Committee^ recommendation, as summarised inparagraph 4 above, is that there should be created a Civil service department, in the charge of the Prime Minister, with the Head of theTHREE IMMEDIATE ISSUES-3-
! J UHome Civil Service as its Permanent Secretary.    The Prime minister would be assisted by a Minister without departmental duties who wouldbe in the Cabinet.    The new Department would take over the functionsof the present pay and management groups of the Treasury, including their present responsibilities for the pay of the Armed Forces and other public services.    The staff and work of the Civil Service commission would be integrated with the new Department, but arrangements would bemade for safeguarding the impartiality of the Commission in the selection of individual candidates.11.       This recommendation will not necessarily be immediatelyacceptable to all the Staff Associations, some of whom gave evidenceagainst it to the Fulton Committee,    Nevertheless the Committee have gone out of their way to meet the points made by the Staff Associationsby spelling out the relationship between the new Department and the new&quot;Treasury&quot; in a way which should secure to the new Department asatisfactory degree of independence.    The Committee recognises thatthe new Department can function properly only if it has, subject to thenormal rules of collective Cabinet responsibility and in presentcircumstances to incomes policy generally, final authority on CivilService pay questions as well as for the policy of the broad, alignment of pay in the public services generally.    The other component of staff costsis numbers.    On this the Committee^ recommendation is that theTreasury, while remaining free to query the policy behind a proposal on the grounds of its costs as a whole, will have to accept the view of theCivil Service Department on the scale of staffing required for any givenlevel of policy activity.12,      On this understanding I recommend that the Government should announce the immediate acceptance of this recommendation and take the steps necessary to set up the new Department.Staff Management and Training13.      The Report also recommends that more resources should be devoted in Departments to all aspects of staff management.    This will naturally take time to build up; and in the early stages, since good menare scarce, it may mean that other activities may not be able to go aheadas fast as some Departments might wish.    Nevertheless it is the mainburden of the Report that the Civil Service has been undermanaged;  and acceptance of the Report implies devoting more resources and betterqualified resources to these ends.14.      Again on the hypothesis that Ministers are prepared to accept the costs, an immediate announcement could be made that the government accept the Committee&apos;s recommendation on training, and intend toestablish a Civil Service College on the lines recommended by theCommittee,    There is general agreement on all sides on the necessityfor a greatly expanded training effort at all levels, and the Committeehave left us free to work out the details ourselves.    Some of these cannotbe settled until the new pattern of the grading structure is clearer;nevertheless a useful start can and should be made.-4-S EC RET
If VIlbStructure of the Service15.      The extent to which the Government should accept, even inprinciple, the proposals made by the Committee for a unified structureseems to me more open than the decisions on the preceding issues.    Thearguments for acceptance are substantial:-(a) There will be wide agreement in principle, both within andwithout the Service, with the objectives of the Committee in framing these proposals, in enabling men to be matched to jobs,in improving the opportunities of Civil Servants fully to develop their talents, and in providing a foundation for the applicationof the principles of accountable management.(b) There can be no doubt that there are at present too many classes in the Service, that their grouping and relationships leaveconsiderable room for improvement and in particular that asa result of this and inadequate personnel management, the best use is not made of the available talent.(c) The CommitteeTs proposals have an immediate and apparentlyegalitarian appeal as providing a clean sweep and a clear new structure, though it will be noted that the main new feature isnot the abolition of horizontal class barriers between higher and lower, which in the case of the general management field was proposed by the Treasury, but in addition the abolition ofvertical lines of division, while yet retaining much of thesubstance of separate occupational groups.16.      On the other hand, practical difficulties may well be shown up bythe thoroughgoing study, which the Committee themselves recognise isnece scary.    Thus;-(a) As regards the implications for pay, only such a study can showwhether such a structure could be reconciled with the established principle of settling pay by fair outside comparisonsof similar work as laid down by the Priestley Royal Commissionof 1953-55.    The arrangements proposed might mean that, when we needed to adjust pay to enable us to recruit or interchangewith the private sector, we should run into new rigidities.(b) Nor can we be certain that it could be introduced withoutunacceptable rises in pay as the result of aligning the existingscales into single grades (where, in order to get staffcigreement,  &quot;levelling up&quot; would be inevitable).(c) There are also possible awkward results for management to theextent that the staff associations could claim a right to be consulted over grading, since this would, under the structure,determine pay, on which, under the Whitley system theGovernment is committed to consult with them.-5-
17.      The Committee state that &quot;given acceptance in principle of our proposals for a unified grading structure1 the first priority is to mounta major study to work out   the details, and they suggest that it wouldtake from three to five years to do this, and implement a schemethroughout the Service.    Clearly it would be right to mount such a studyafter the necessary consultations with the Staff Side.    If the Governmentwere on the balance of the foregoing considerations to commit themselves at the outset to the acceptance in principle which is recommended by the Committee, it would be important that thisshould be done in terms which adequately preserve the rights of theStaff Side to consultation and negotiation.THE REMAINING RECOMMENDATIONS18,      There are a large number of these and it is only possible in thismemorandum to deal with the more important ones.     These are(a) Recruitment(b) Career Management(c) Mobility, pensions and a career service(d) Accountable management(e) Hiving off(f) Planning Units(g) Top appointments-(h) Review of progressRecruitment19.      The Committee recommend enquiries into certain aspects of selection and this will be put in hand at once.    There is, however, oneof their recommendations which is likely to be controversial.    This isthat in the recruitment of graduates preference should be given to those with degrees in &quot;relevant&quot; subjects - though &quot;relevance&quot; is not defined.The extent to which knowledge obtained in a first degree course is ofoverriding importance in the qualifications of an administrative civil servant is debatable;  the arguments against it are well set out in theReport (paragraph 80) where the views of a dissenting minority are given.The re is also the practical difficulty of deciding which degree coursesare &quot;relevant&quot;.    It seems inevitable that we must allow public debate totake place on this question and consider it in consultation not only withthe Staff Associations but also with the University authorities, before coming to a decision.    On the other hand it would be far lesscontroversial, and would probably help recruitment, to make it clearthat in assigning successful candidates to Departments regard will be had to the subject matter of their degree course and any other relevantexperience.-6-
Career Management20.     A great deal of what the Committee say on this cubject is entirely acceptable but there will be doubts and controversy about their proposal that non-specialist administrators should be grouped accordingto broad areas of subject matter, and that the first two groups for thispurpose should be an &quot;economic&quot; group and a &quot;social&quot; group.    It ispossible to interpret this idea loosely or rigidly;  if it is taken rigidlyand thought to mean that every administrator at the outset of his careershould be labelled either &quot;economic&quot; or &quot;social&quot; then the disadvantages of the proposal are obvious enough.    There are many areas ofgovernment that cannot be described as either economic or social, andit is clear that administrators in the social field need appreciation ofeconomic techniques and vice versa.    H a rigid line of demarcationwere followed we would be in danger of recreating rigidities of the kind which the Committee wish to get rid of in their proposal for the abolitionof the existing classes.    If, on the other hand, it is interpreted moreloosely, and taken to indicate that we should so plan the careers of individual civil servants that they obtain progressively wider experience in related fields, and that two very important such fields are those ofeconomic and social policy, then it is clearly much more acceptable.In this area again no immediate decision seems appropriate.Mobility, Pensions and a Career Service21.      To encourage and facilitate late entry to the Service, as theCommittee recommend, will be to continue an existing trend.    coupled with this is the CommitteeTs proposal to do away with &quot;established&quot;status.    To abolish the link between &quot;establishment&quot; and pensionabilityis compatible with modern developments in the pension field, and to defer the granting of established or permanent status until a proper period of probation or trial is satisfactorily concluded, should not in principlecause difficulty, though continuity of pension rights would need to be safeguarded In the case of late entry from other pensionable employment.The Committee recommends that some concept of permanent status isdesirable, even if &quot;establishment&quot; is the wrong term, and this is acceptable.    The payment of pensions to temporary staff would be costly,as would the other pension recommendations, including the shorterqualifying period and free transfer-ability.    These changes, includingboth their feasibility and their cost, will require detailed study and negotiation with the staff associations.    It will also be necessary toconsider them in the context of the new earnings-related pension schemewhich is now being considered by the Government.Accountable Management22.     There Is certainly room, as the Committee suggest, for a much wider application of the principles of accountable management, and management by objective, to the work of the Civil Service,    We arealready moving in this direction and there is no doubt that we should go asfar as we possibly can.    There are of course difficulties, as the Committeehave noted; much work cuts across departmental boundaries and therefore the responsibilities of different Ministers are involved.    In these andother cases it will not be easy to provide operational definitions of objectives for particular units, especially in headquarters1 offices.
This is also true of much of the Parliamentary and negotiating work, aswell as the task of keeping in contact with outside interests and activities.There is also the point, which the Committee note, that these ideas will need a fresh look at the traditional forms of Government accounting.Nevertheless the Service could and should go much further in thisdirection.&quot;Hiving Off&quot;23.      The Committee examined briefly the proposition that furtherareas of Civil Service work should be &quot;hived off&quot; from centralgovernment and entrusted to autonomous boards or corporations.It was put to them that this might be one way of creating new &quot;accountableunits of management&quot; not only for public commercial enterprises butalso for blocks of executive activity.     To such units the test of efficiencyas demonstrated by results could be more readily applied.     &quot;Hiving off&quot;appeared to have succeeded in Sv/eden but attracted criticism in theUnited States.24.      The present Government legislated to establish the airports authority and proposes to carry out the largest piece of &quot;hiving off&quot;which is ever likely to occur by making the Post Office a public corporation,    Some further &quot;hiving off&quot; is one of the possibilitieswhich could flow from the Green Paper on Health Service Organisationbeing prepared by the Minister.    There is probably no great dispute aboutthe merits of hiving off commercial activities which can be made largelyor wholly self-supporting.     The tests for other executive activities arelikely to be whether the management can genuinely be called to account by reference to results;  and whether Ministers are ready to decide, and parliament and public opinion to accept, that they should renounce day-to-day control and responsibility.     The Committee are surely right tosay that there is something worth further study here, and as a first step a good deal of work on it will need to be done in the Civil service department and other Departments,Planning Units and Senior Policy Advisers25,      The proposal for a planning unit in each Department, divorced from responsibility for day-to-day business, has much to commend itand is indeed adopted in some Departments;  it is not invariably,however, the best way of doing the job.    In some of the more complexDepartments more than one unit will be necessary;  in others planningis virtually the whole of their work;  in others again it cannot be donewithin the boundaries of the Department, but must be done inter -departmentally.    The need however for special provision for forward planning is undisputed;  most Departments would agree that they do not do as much of this as they should and would wish to do, primarilybecause of the pressures of current work and the shortage of suitablestaff.    The relieving of these difficulties would be widely welcomed,26,      The Committee associate with their proposal for planning units,a recommendation that there should be in each Department one or more&quot;Senior Policy Advisers&quot;,    This will need careful consideration;  itappears to he based, at least in part, on a misunderstanding of thepresent practice.    The idea of the &quot;monolithic&quot; Departments in whichthe Permanent Secretary was the sole source of advice to a minister was never as widespread as outside observers seem to think and is nowalmost entirely obsolete;  Ministers receive policy advice direct fromDeputy Secretaries and in many cases also from Under-Seer etaries.,
and professional advice is fed in at all levels.    The precise way in whichadvice on future planning is dovetailed into these arrangements and theorganisation for deciding what future planning should be done and whatpriority should be given to it will no doubt vary from Department toDepartment; but it would be wrong, in my view, to do anything todetract from the ultimate authority of the Permanent Secretary inthis as in other matters - the importance of which the Committeerecognise,27.      In view of the different circumstances of each Department, itwould seem that the best procedure in relation to both these recommen-dations would be for Departments to inform die Civil service department both of their existing arrangements for future planning and policy advice together with any proposals they may have for modifying and developing them to meet the objectives of the FultonCommittee1 s recomniendations,Top Appointments28,      The Committee recommend that the Head of the Home CivilService, in advising the Prime Minister on top appointments, shouldbe assisted by a Board of Permanent Secretaries, top specialists andsome eminent outsiders*    This is a sensible recommendation whichshould reassure people that justice is done and is seen to be done.It is questionable, however, whether eminent outsiders should be members of the Board, even though there may well be occasions when the advice of particular outsiders could usefully be obtained.Since no outsider could know more than a small proportion of possiblecandidates their role would inevitably be that of overseeing the way inwhich decisions were taken.     There would be difficulty in choosing an acceptable panel of outsiders and circumstances could arise in which thefreedom of Ministers could be restricted, in a way which would nothappen if the Board consisted solely of serving civil servants.Review of Progress29, The Committee invite the Government either to report annuallyto Parliament on progress over the next five years, or alternatively toset up another Committee of the same kind as the Fulton Committee to review progress at the end of the five-year period. Partly for thereasons given by the dissenting minority and partly because five yearsmay turn out not to be a sensible interval, the Committeels first alternative seems to be the sounder one,CRITICISMS OF THE CIVIL SERVICE30,      So far this memorandum has been concerned with the lecommen-dations of the Committee which are dealt with in Chapters 2-8 of theirReport.    This is prefaced, in Chapter 1, by a description and critiqueof the state of the Civil Service at present.    It is of course accepted,and indeed to be welcomed, that the Committee should have been bothsearching and forthright in its criticisms, and the permanent secretaries whom I have consulted have told me that they recognisethat much of the criticism is fair in substance, even if parts of it areoverdrawn and most could well have been differently expressed,
31       We believe however that the Report as a whole will be badly-received in a considerable part of the Service, partly as being unbalancedin concentrating almost exclusively on criticism with, little regard to thestrength of the Service, and partly because to many civil servants someof the Cornmittee&apos;s analysis will be seen to be at variance with the fact as they know them - in particular that scant regard appears to have been paid to the great changes in the structure of the Service that have takenplace since the reorganisation committee of 1920 as well as the considerableefforts for change and modernisation that have been going on in the last few years.    We fear that this may distract attention from the undoubtedmerits, not only of the Committee&apos;s broad objectives, but also of muchof what they propose, and that morale could be aflected in parts of theService, both in relation to its present tasks and also in pressing throughwith the necessary enthusiasm reforms on the general lines which theCommittee recommend.    Careful handling will be necessary to avoid this and to secure practical advantages from the Committee&apos;s work.This has obvious implications for the way in which the Governmentpresent their own first reactions to the Report,ISSUES FOR DECISION32.      These would appear to be as follows:(i) Is the additional cost in manpower and money required for tacklingat any rate the basic recommendations of the Report acceptable?(ii) If so should the Government announce at the time the P*.eport is published decisions on:(a) The proposed Civil Service Department.(b) The Civil Service Training College and the new training policy,(c) The introduction of a unified grading structure.(iii) As regards the rest of the recommendations, should theannouncement say that the Government welcome the objectives ofthe Report and will be examining them urgently with a view to reaching decisions to be announced in due course, and that in the meantime they accept the proposal for an enquiry into methods of selection.

PREFACE-    1611,    We were appointed on 8th February, 1966 to &quot;examine the structure, recruitment and management, including training, of theHome Civil Service, and to make recommendations.&apos;   We describe thescope of our inquiry at Appendix A.2.    In producing our report we are greatly indebted to a largenumber of people - for their evidence, both written and oral, andfor the research they have done on our behalf.   We have thought itbest to reserve most of our very many acknowledgements for Appendix L,where we also indicate the methods and; procedures we have followed inthe course of our inquiry.3.    In order to keep the main body of our report short, and, we hope, readable, we have confined it to a statement of our main proposals and the reasons for them.   We have thus, with very few exceptions, deliberately refrained from summarising, debating oreven referring in the course of the argument to the many points that have been put to us, both orally and in writing.   The evidencehas been so voluminous that we could not have done justice to it without multiplying the length of our report many times.   We decidedUhat we must avoid this.   We hope that this will not lead those whogave evidence to us to feel that what they said has been ignored;it should be clear from what we have written how greatly we havebeen influenced by it.k.    Some of the appendices, printed in this volume, deal more fully with certain topics than was practicable in the main body of ourreportv and make further, more detailed recommendations.   In thesewe discuss some of the evidence that has mainly influencedour thinking on these topics; and Appendix K gives a more general account of the evidence that has attean especially positivecontribution to our work.5*    Our main findings are summarised at the end of the report and before the appendices.   A detailed list of our recommendations isa* the end of this volume.B*   We are publishing four further volumes containing the writtenWence that has been put before us and the reports of various
investigations and surreys.   There rare listed in the table ofs and briefly described in Appendix L.I    We have reached a very wide measure of agreement.   Some of us have reservations on certain points, which are indicated in the textjor the rest, we would not all put the same emphasis on everystatement; some of us would have wished to go further, and others lessfar.

I    Lord Simey enters a reservation on this chapter.      It is printedon pageCHAPTER ITHE CIVIL SERVICE TODAYThe Home Civil Service today is still fundamentally the product of the nineteenth-century philosophy of the Northcote-Trevelyanreport. The tasks it faces are those of the second half of thetwentieth century.    This is what we have found; it is what we seek to r emedy.*2.    The foundations were laid by Northcote and Trevelyan in theirreport of I85I4..   Northcote and Trevelyan were much influenced byMacaulay whose Committee reported in the same year on the reform ofthe India .Service.   The two reports, so remarkable for their bluntnessand &quot;brevity (together they run to about twenty pages in theoriginal printing), have had such a far-reaching influence that wereproduce them in full in Appendix B.3.    These reports condemned the nepotism, the incompetence and otherdefects of the system inherited from the eighteenth century,    Bothproposed the introduction of competitive entry examinations.    TheMacaulay Report extolled the merits of the young men from Oxford and cambridge who had read nothing but subjects unrelated to their futurecareers.   The Northcote-Trevelyan Report pointed to the possiblej advantages of reading newer, more relevant subjects, such as geographyor political economy, rather than the classics.    But as the two services grew, this difference between the two reports seems to havebeen lost.   There emerged the tradition of the &quot;all-rounder&quot;    as he hasbeen called by his champions, or &quot;amateur&quot; as he has been called by his critics,i    Both reports concentrated on the graduates who thereafter came to form the top of each service.    They took much less notice of therest. In India, the supporting echelons were native, and theI echnical services, such as railways and engineering, were theI business of specialists who stood lower than the ruling administrators.I n0!Ee* the all-round administrators were to be supported by non-jpduates to do executive and clerical work and by specialists (e.g.
-     169Inspectors of Scnools) in those departments where they were needed.a man had to enter the Service on completing his education; once in,&quot;he was in for life.   The outcome was a career service, immune fromnepotism and political jobbery and, by the same token, attractive forits total security as well as for the intellectual achievement and social status  that  success in the entry examination implied.5.    Carrying out the ^orthcote-Trevelyan report took time;  therewas long debate.    Over the years other committees and commissions have considered various aspects of the Civil Service.   Many new specialistclasses have been added to the system, notably the scientists, engineers and their supporting classes:  there is now an impressive amount of detailed training.   Many other modifications have been made.   Thereports of the main committees and commissions are summarised and discussed in a note published in Volume 3.6.    Nevertheless, the basic principles and philosophy of theNorthcote-Trevelyan report have prevailed:  the essential features oftheir structure have remained.7.    Meanwhile, the role of government has greatly changed.    Itstraditional regulatory functions have multiplied in size and greatlybroadened in scope.    It has taken on vast new responsibilities.    Itis expected to achieve such general economic aims as full employment,a. satisfactory rate of growth, stable   prices and a healthy balanceof payments.   Through these and other policies (e.g. public purchasing,^investment grants, financial regulators) it profoundly influences theoutput, costs and profitability of industry generally in both thehome and overseas markets.   Through nationalisation it more directlycontrols a number of basic industries.    It has responsibilities forthe location of industry and for town and country planning.    Itengages in research and development both for civil and military purposes.   It provides comprehensive social services and is now expected to promote the fullest possible development of individualUlaan Potential.   All these changes have made for a massive growth in public expenditure.    Public spending means public control,   A centurya8Q the tasks of government were mainly passive and regulatory.

-    1706     Technological progress and the vast amount of new knowledge&apos;j(   e        a impact on these U.U an. on the process of taKing&quot;decisions; the change goes on.   Siting a new airport, buying military supplies, striking the right balance between coal, gas, oil and nuclear-powered, electricity in a new energy policy - all these problems compel civil servants to use new techniques of analysis,management and co-ordination which are beyond those not speciallytrained in them.9,    The increase in the positive activities of government has notbeen solely an extension of the powers and functions of the State inan era of technological change.    There has also been a complexintermingling of the public and private sectors.    This has led to aproliferation of para-state organisations: public corporations,nationalised industries, negotiating bodies with varying degrees ofpublic and private participation, public participation in privateenterprises, voluntary bodies financed from public funds.    Betweenthe operations of the public and the private sectors there is oftenno clear boundary.   Central and local government stand in a similarlyintricate relationship; central government is generally held responsible for services that it partly or mainly finances but localauthorities actually provide.    As the tasks of government have grown and become more complex, so the need to consult and co-ordinate has grown as well.10.   The time it takes to reach a decision and carry it out has oftenlengthened.   This is partly because of technological advance and the resulting complexity e.g. of defence equipment.   Another reasonis that the public and Parliament demand greater foresight and order in,for example, the development of land, the transport system and other resources, than they did in the past.11.   Governments also work more and more in an international setting.The improvement in communications and the greater interdependence ofNations enlarges the difficulties as well as the opportunities of\ government.
12,   to meet these new tasks of government the modern Civil Servicefiust &quot;be able to handle the social, economic, scientific and technical problems of our time, in an international setting.    Because thesolutions to complex problems need long preparation, the Service mustbe far-sighted; from its accumulated knowledge and experience, itmust show initiative in working out what are the needs of the future and how they might be met.    a special responsibility now rests uponthe civil Service because one Parliament or even one Government oftencannot see the process through.13.   j\t the same time, the Civil Service works under political direction and under the obligation of political accountability.    This is the setting in which the daily work of many civil servants is carried out ;thus they need to have a lively awareness of the political implications of what they are doing or advising.    The Civil Service has also to beflexible enough to serve governments of any political complexion -whether they are committed to extend or in certain respects to reducethe role of the State.    Throughout, it has to remember that it existsto serve the whole community and that imaginative humanity sometimesmatters more than tidy efficiency and administrative uniformity.Ik.   In our view the structure and practices of the Service have notkept up with the changing tasks.    The defects we have found cannearly all be attributed to this.    We have found no instance wherereform has run ahead too rapidly.    So, today, the Service is in need of fundamental change.    It is inadequate in six main respects for themost efficient discharge of the present and prospective responsibilitiesqf government.15.   First, the Service is still essentially based on the philosophyqf the amateur (or  &quot;generalise or &quot;all-rounder&apos;).   This is mostevident in the Administrative Class which holds the dominant positionin the Service.   The ideal administrator is still too often seen aslP-e gifted layman who, moving frequently from job to job within the^Service, can take a practical view of any problem, irrespective of itsj6ub5ect-matter, in the light of his knowledge and experience of the
government machine.    Today, as the report of our Management Consultancy&quot;roup* illustrates,  this concept has most damaging consequences.    Itcannot make for  the efficient despatch of public business when keymen rarely stay in one job longer than two to three years before being moved to some other post, often in a very different area ofgovernment activity.   A similar cult of the generalist is found inthat part of the Executive Class that works in support of theAdministrative Class and also even in some of the specialist classes.The cult is obsolete at all levels and in all parts of the Service.16.   secondly, the present system of classes in the Serviceseriously impedes its work.   The Service is divided into classesboth horizontally (between higher and lower in the same broad areaof work) and vertically (between different skills, professions ordisciplines).   There are U.7 general classes whose members work inmost government departments and over 1 ,U00 departmental classes^.Each civil servant is recruited to a particular class; his membership of that class determines his prospects (most classes have their owncareer structures) and the range of jobs on which he may be employed.It is true that there is some subsequent movement between classes;but such rigid and prolific compartmentalism in the Service leads tothe setting up of cumbersome organisational forms, seriously hampersthe Service in adapting itself to new tasks, prevents the best use of individual talent, contributes to the inequality of promotionprospects, causes frustration and resentment and impedes the entry into wider management of those well-fitted for it.17.   Thirdly, many scientists, engineers and members of otherspecialist classes get neither the full responsibilities and corresponding authority, nor the opportunities they ought to have.Too often they are organised in s eparate hierarchies in which the policyand financial aspects of the work are reserved to a parallel group0&quot;&quot;generalist&quot;administrators ; and their access to higher managementSee Chapter 2, paragraphThese figures, and those quoted throughout our report, relateexcept where otherwise stated to non-industrial staff excludingtne Post Office (see Appendix A).
j -173and policy-making is restricted.    Partly this is because many ofthem are equipped only to practise their own specialism; a body of men with the qualities of the French polytechnicien - skilled in his craft,hut skilled too, as an administrator - has so far not been devolped in britain.    In the new Civil Service a wider and more important rolemust he opened, up for specialists trained and equipped for it.18.   fourthly, too few civil servants are skilled managers.    Sincethe major managerial role in the Service is specifically allocated to members of the Administrative Glass it follows that this criticismapplies particularly to them.    Few members of the class actually seethemselves as managers, i. e. as responsible for organisation, directingstaff, planning the progress of work, setting standards of attainmentana measuring results, reviewing procedures and quantifying differentcourses of action.    one reason for this is that they are not adequatelytrained in management.    Another is that much of their work is notmanagerial in this sense; so they tend to think of themselves asadvisers on policy to people above them, rather than as managers ofthe administrative machine below them.    Scientists and otherspecialists are also open to criticism here: not enough have been trained in management, particularly in personnel management, projectmanagement, accounting and control.19.   Fifthly, there is not enough contact between the Service and therest of the community.    There is not enough awareness of how the worldoutside Whitehall works, how government policies will affect it, andthe new ideas and methods which are developing in the universities,in business and in other walks of life.    Partly this is a consequenceof a career service.    Since we expect most civil servants to spendtheir entire working lives in the Service, we can hardly wonder if theyhave little direct and systematic experience of the daily life and thought of other people.   A new element has been added to this inv recent years; our Social Survey of the Civil Service finds that the
pattern of recruitment and promotion to the Administrative Glasshas tended to make it socially and educationally more uniform*.    Thepublic interest must suffer from any exclusiveness or isolation whichhinders a full understanding of contemporary problems or undulyrestricts the free flow of men, knowledge and ideas between theservice and the outside world,20.   finally, we have serious criticisms of personnel management.career-planning covers too small a section of the service - mainly the Administrative glass - and is not sufficiently purposive ororoperly conceived; civil servants are moved too frequently betweenunrelated jobs, often with scant regard to personal preference oraptitude.   Nor is there enough encouragement and reward for individualinitiative and objectively measured performance: for many civilservants,-especially in the lower grades, promotion depends too much on seniority.21.   For these and other defects the central management of theservice, the treasury, must accept its share of responsibility.it is unfortunate that there was not a major reform in the post-war years when the government took on so many new tasks and the service had been loosened by war-time temporary r ecruitment and improvisation.there was then a great opportunity to preserve and adapt to peace-time conditions the flexibility which war had imposed.    For a number of reasons, not all of them internal to the Service, this opportunity wasnot taken.   In the 1950&apos;s the old ways reasserted themselves.    Thenature of the task was changing and the Service was left behind.only recently has any attempt been made to introduce significantreforms.   Despite the recent improvement in its management services the treasury has failed to keep the Service up to date.22.   To some extent the urgent need for fundamental reform has been- obscured by the Serviced very considerable strengths, notably its capacity for improvisation - aptly demonstrated by the speed with*&apos;nich new departments have been set up in the last four years.    There&apos;*e commissioned a survey of the social and educational backgroundQf the main general-service classes     It was carried out bydr.. a. h. Halsey, Head of the Department of Social and Administrativestudies at the University of Oxford, and Mr. i. m, Crewe, AssistantLecturer in Politics at the University of Lancaster.

are exceptionally able men and women at all levels.    There is a strongsense of public service.    Its integrity and impartiality areunquestioned.    V/e believe that the country does not recognise enoughhow impressively conscientious many civil servants are in the personalservice they give to the public.    It is of high importance that these and other qualities should be preserved.23.   In making our proposals for reform we have been influenced by what we have seen of foreign civil services - the emphasis on training and professionalism in Prance, the way young men of thrustand vigour in Prance and Sweden quickly reach posts of highresponsibility where they are directly advising Ministers,thecontributions the  &apos;in-and-outers1 make to government in the UnitedStates and the role played by specialists in both the United Statesand Prance.   Our impressions of the visits we paid to these three countries are recorded in Appendix 0.2ii.   One basic guiding principle should in our view govern the  futured development of the Civil Service.     It applies to any  organisationand is simple to the point of banality, but the root of much  of ourcriticism is that it has not been observed.    The principle is: look at the job first.   The Civil Service must continuously review the tasks it is called upon to perform and the possible ways in which itmight perform them; it should then think out what new skills andkinds of men are needed, and how these men can be found, trained anddeployed.   The service must avoid a static view of a new ideal man and structure which in its turn could become as much of an obstacle to change as the present inheritance.25.   V/e have nought to devise a form of management for the CivilService that will ensure that it is better run and enable it to generate its own self-criticism and forward drive.    One of the maintroubles of the Service has been that, in achieving immunity from political intervention, a system was evolved which until recently was virtually immune from outside pressures for change.   Since it was notimmune from inside resistance to change, inertia was perhapsPredictable.
CHAPTER 2176THE TASKS OF THE MODERN CIVIL SERVICEAND THE MEN AND WOMEN THEY NEED26.   The tasks of modern government make heavy demands on civilservants at every level.   Their jobs are immensely various.    we thought it necessary, both for our own guidance and to help general understanding, to investigate and report in detail on the work that civil servants do.   We therefore commissioned a special investigation of the work of the Service.   It was carried out by a group led by amember of the Committee, Dr. Norman Hunt, and including manage nentconsultants, an executive from a business firm and a civil servantfrom the Organisation and Methods Division of the Treasury.   Theirreport, which we publish as Volume 2, contains a description of thework of those areas of the Service that they studied.   We do not propose to summarise it here.   But it is important at least tooutline the general scope of the work of civil servants before considering what skills and kinds of men and women are needed.27.   Civil servants work in support of Ministers in their public and parliamentary duties.    Some of them prepare plans and advise on policy,assembling and interpreting all the data required - whether for adecision on a new social security policy, a change in defence policy,a new national transport policy or a new international joint project in the technical field; and whether Ministers, individually orcollectively, place greater or lesser reliance on direct government intervention.   They prepare legislation and assist Ministers withits passage through Parliament.   They draft regulations and answers to Parliamentary Questions.   They produce briefs for debates and the mass of information which the constitutional principle of parliamentary and public accountability requires.    Increasingly, senior civilservants now appear before Parliamentary Committees.    Some of thisvaried work has no counterpart in business or, indeed, anywhereoutside the government service,28*   Operating policies embodied in existing legislation andimplementing policy decisions take up most of the time of most civil8ervanta,   There are taxes to be collected, employment and social
security offices to be run.   There is a mass of individual case-workhnth in local offices and in the central departments of state. - new policy may require the creation of a new administrative frameworks   &apos;&apos; &apos;There are major programmes to be managed and controlled, such as the planning and engineering of motorways from their initial location and design to the finished construction; the design of Polaris installa-tions and other military works; the management of internationalprogrammes like Concorde; the vast range of scientific research anddevelopment and of government procurement; the central responsibilityfor the nationalised industries and for the state of the economy.29.   Some of the work involves the Civil Service in complexrelationships with other bodies which are partners in the executionof Government policy or are directly affected by it.    They includelocal authorities and nationalised industries in the first categoryand a multitude of organised interests in the second.    This work calls for practical judgement and negotiating skill.   It also calls for a thorough knowledge of the subject under negotiation and of the problems and interests of the bodies concerned.    In the economic field, forexample, many civil servants need a knowledge of industry and an understanding of market forces.30.   Technical progress has a major impact on both the making andthe implementation of policy, whether the tasks are traditional or new to government.    Computers are a good example of this; they offerprospects of sophisticated administration hitherto impossible bypermitting much more comprehensive approaches to problems and theuse of raore, and vastly more complex, data.   This trend greatlyenhances the importance of numeracy.    Skill in the use of numbers is needed in addition to the qualities of judgement and foresight.31.   Even this brief and impressionistic description is perhapsenough to make it clear that, as a body, civil servants today haveto be equipped to tackle the political, scientific, social, economic and technical problems of our time.    They have to be aware of interests and opinions throughout the country and of many developmentsI abroad.   They have to keep up with the rapid growth of new^owledge and acquire new techniques to apply it.   In short theCivil Service is no place for the amateur.   It must be staffed byfflen and vjoBien who are truly professional.
We use the word &quot;prof essional&quot; in this context to include two .main attributes which in our view are essential in varying combinations&quot;&quot;-or work in the government service.   One is being skilled in one&apos; s job* skill which comes from training and sustained experience.   The otheris having the fundamental knowledge of and deep familiarity with a subject that enable a man to move with ease among its concepts.   Bothspring from and reinforce a constant striving for higher standards.The work of government demands these qualities not only in the membersof the generally recognised professions, but at all levels and in all parts of the Service.   We use &quot;professional1 in this comprehensivesense.33,   These attributes of professionalism are already present in theCivil Service in some measure.    But today&apos;s tasks require themto be   much further developed than hitherto.   The Service must also be quicker to recognise the contribution new professional skillscan make to its work.34.   There are two broad types of professionalims that we believe the Service needs.35.   The first is the professionalism of those whose work ingovernment is just one of a number of career opportunities for theexercise of their qualifications and skills.   In this category arethe architects, lawyers, doctors, engineers, scientists, accountants,economists, draughtsmen, technicians and so on.   Some of these, likedoctors and scientists, have acquired their professionalism orspecialism by recognised training outside the Service.    Others, likesome draughtsmen and technicians, may acquire and develop their s illsafter joining the Service.   In either event   in their early years theydo much the same type of work in the public service as if they had gone into private practice, business, the universities or local government.In the rest of this report we shall normally refer to these men and^omen gs &quot;specialists1, not to denote any narrow sub-division of someprofessional field, but solely as a convenient label for this broadcategory of Civil Service staff.36.  The Civil Service already employs large numbers of men and women of ^is type.   But it has not always recognised the need for new kindsQf specialism quickly enough or recruited enough specialists of thequality that the public interest demands.   In particular, it has
been slovs to recognise the benefits that would flow from a much largerrecruitment of particular categories such as accountants, statisticians, economists and Research Officers and their employment in positions of greater responsibility.   For example, while there were 106 \/yeconomists in the Civil Service in 1967, there were only 19 in 1963.We discuss the specific problems of accountants and Research 0fficers*lin Appendix D.   Here we think it right to draw special attention tothe position of accountants.37.   Present practice in the Civil Service severely restricts the role of the Accountant Class and excludes its members from responsibilityfor financial control.   They are limited to the relatively narrow fieldin which departments themselves keep commercial accounts or areconcerned with the financial operations of commercial organisations.Their outlets into other kinds of work and into posts of highermanagement are severely limited.   At present the Service employs only309 accountants of whom 6k are temporary; no post carries a salary of&quot;more than  4,500 and there are only six accountants1 posts withsalaries above  3,650.    In our view, qualified accountants could makea valuable contribution to the management of several areas of civilservice work: for example, in financial forecasting and control, inthe whole field of government procurement and in reviewing thefinancial performance of nationalised industries.    These are areas ofwork similar to those in which accountants are prominent in industry;but they are generally excluded from them in the Civil Service.Further, the skills of the modern management accountant appear to usto be increasingly needed at high levels of policy-making and management.   He is trained to evaluate policy options in financial terms, to compare the costs and benefits arising from different usesof resources, and to apply quantitative techniques to the control ofexpenditure and the measurement of efficiency.38.   In addition to employing specialists in the right numbers andof the right type and quality, the Service should also allow them toharry more responsibility.   Their organisation in separate hierarchies,with the policy and financial aspects of their work reserved toparallel group of &quot;generalisf administrators, has manifestaA class engaged on research mainly in the field of the socialfences,   a fuller description is given in Appendix D.
disadvantages.   It slows down the processes of decision and management,-ads to inefficiency, frequently means that no individual has clearmanagerial authority, and prevents the specialists from exercisingthe full range of responsibilities normally associated with theirprofessions and exercised by their counterparts outside the service,in addition, the obstacles at present preventing them from reachingtop management must be removed.    The need for wider outlets alsogenerally apples to specialists whose work in peculiar to government,such as Tax Inspectors.   For specialists who are to carry these greaterresponsibilities there will heed to be a deliberate policy of trainingin administration and management.    Our proposals to achieve theseends are contained in later chapters.39.    The second kind of professionalism which needs to be much more fully developed is the professionalism of those members of theAdministrative and Executive Classes who are now treated, and regard themselves,as  &quot;generalists&apos;.    In the rest of this report we shall refer to members of both these classes and their future counterparts asAdministrators&apos;.   Parts of their work closely resemble management in industry and commerce; other parts do not.   We use Administrator % like&quot;specialist&apos;, as the most generally convenient label.k1.    Frequent moves from 30b to job within the Service or within a department give   &quot;generalisf  administrators proficiency in operatingthe government machine, and in serving Ministers and Parliament.    but many lack the fully developed professionalism   that their work nowdemands.   They do not develop adequate knowledge in depth in any one aspect of the department fs work and frequently not even in the generalarea of activity in which the department operates.     Often they arerequired to give advice on subjects they do not sufficiently under-stand or to take decisions whose significance they do not fully grasp.This has serious consequences.    It can lead to bad policy-making; itprevents a fundamental evaluation of the policies being administered;&apos;-t often leads to the adoption of inefficient methods for implementingthese policies - methods which are sometimes baffling to those outsidethe Service who are affected by them; and it obstructs the establish-Eent of fruitful contacts with sources of expert advice both inside
and outside the Service.ill.   The fuller professionalism now required from all administratorsincluding by our definition those now classified as &quot;Executive&quot;) in turn calls for new principles to be applied to their selection,training and deployment.     It must be accepted that for the administrator to be expert in running the government machine is not initself enough.     He must in future also have or acquire the basicconcepts and knowledge, whether social, economic, industrial or financial, relevant to his area of administration and appropriate tohis level of responsibility.     He must have a real understanding of,and familiarity with, the principles, techniques and trends ofdevelopment in the subject-matter of the field in which he isoperating.1+2.   As we Bee it, the application of this principle means that anadministrator must specialise, particularly in his early years,  inone of the various areas of administration.     At the same time, sincemodern administration requires men to have breadth as well as depth,and since civil servants operate in a political environment, it seemsto us important that such specialisation should not be too narrowlyconceived.     We considered two possible ways of achieving the objectives.43-   We considered whether we should recommend a grouping of departments on the basis of their main areas of activity.     Thus, somedepartments are mainly concerned with social problems, others witheconomic, financial, commercial and industrial problems and others*ith scientific or technical problems.     It seemed attractive tobelieve that if departments were broadly grouped in this way anadministrator might best develop his professionalism, and in particularbis knowledge of the subject-matter of his area of administration, byspending most of his career within one group of departments.     Werejected this solution.     It is possible broadly to group departmentsl-- this way, yet almost every department has its own mixture ofSocialf scientific, economic and financial work.     The Department ofI education and Science is a good example.     While predominantly a socialApartment, with branches dealing with schools, teachers, further6
education and so on, nevertheless:- 182(a) administrators also staff the Accountant General&apos;s Branchwhich deals mainly with financial and economic questions;di(b) there are administrators in its Architects and BuildingsBranch concerned largely with the technical and financial aspects of school-building programmes and projects;(c) administrators staff its Establishment and OrganisationBranch which is concerned with individual, career management and the promotion of efficiency and economy in theorganisation of the department;(d) there is a large proportion of administrators among thestaff of the General Science Branch and of the Council for scientific Policy.Today the. pattern in the Department of Education and Science, as inany other department, is for an administrator to move from job tojob between these widely differing branches within the department.It is this pattern of movement that we have criticised as an obstacle to the development of the required professionalism.    If the Departmentof Education and Science were simply grouped with other socialdepartments, this would only multiply the number of different kinds of job to which a man would be liable to be moved.   This woulddefeat our aims rather than promote them.   We recommend, therefore,a different solution.hk.   Although the tasks that fall to administrators are immenselyvaried, we believe that they fall into broad categories which areidentifiable on the basis of the subject-matter of the work ratherthan on the basis of the particular department in which the work is done.   It is on this&apos; categorisation by subject-matter thatadministrative specialisation should be based.^5.   We have not been able to survey all the administrative jobs inthe Service. It is for the Civil Service Department to analyse themand to identify groups of jobs which provide a field for specialis-ation on the basis of their common subject matter.   We believe,however, that we can identify two such groups at present.^Tjff* &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;..............ian mi 1.1mi i ......mm     &apos; mm.....        -- -----.......... ,,S8L5eC0mra8nd in Chapter 7 that the central management of the CivilDeTia t  8hould be transferred from the Treasury to a new Civil Servicenew a From *Wb. point onwards in our report we refer to thisC8 , - Partment by,name when we discuss the part to be played byJral management in running the Service.
146.   First, we think that a &quot;broad group of administrative jobs indifferent departments is concerned with a subject-matter that    is primarily economic and financial.     Within this broad group the emphasis in some areas of government may be on general economic planning and control;    in others, on the problems of international trade  pr of particular industries;    in others, on the financial control of major programmes of capital and current expenditure;    in others (mainly in technical and scientific departments) on the economicand financial aspects of large   technological projects.     Thus,from a general economic and financial basis, the work develops itstown internal specialisms.     We think that this pattern should be reflected in the training and deployment of individual administratorsfor this work.47.   There is a second broad group of administrative jobs where thebasis is essentially social;   for example, housing, town and country planning, education, race relations, social security, industrial relations, personnel management, crime and delinquency.     Again, withina common framework of knowledge and experience, the work develops itsown specialisms.     Here too the training and deployment of individualadministrators should reflect this pattern.1^8.   Each of these two main categories of work has its ownsubstantial and broadly-based body of knowledge.     We believe that a civil servant needs to draw on this to supplement his skills as anadministrator if he is to develop the professionalism now needed.     so the Service must ensure that its administrators acquire and develop theappropriate body of knowledge together with its associated conceptualframework and analytical tools.     This means that an administrators atleast in his early years, should specialise in one or other of thesemain categories of work - the economic, industrial and financial, orthe social,,     In consequence, for basic training and career managementadministrators should be distinguished into these two broad groups.re empha8ise that this should not preclude further groupings if theseare found necessary or desirable.
I -    184j,,9      The economic and financial administrators should &quot;be men andwomen who, in addition to their skill in administration, also haveappropriate qualifications, experience and training in such subjects as economics, finance, business administration, and statistics,especially as applied to government work.   Their deployment shouldnot be limited only to the main economic departments of government.They should be employed in any department . in posts that    are mainly financial or concerned with economic administration and management.   They should, as we have said, add to their basic knowledgeof their field any further specialisation that particular areas ofgovernment work require.   Thus, the    career pattern of the economic and financial administrator . may involve movement between departments; it should involve a steady broadening of an individual^ responsibility as he moves upwards, but he should normallyI move between posts appropriate to members of the group,I These administrators will not replace specialist economists; we discussj their relationship below.5Q.    We have proposed that within the economic and financial group of administrators there should be different branches of furtherspecialisation.   One of these to which we wish to draw special attention is work in the predominantly scientific and technical areasof the Service.   These areas will, be largely staffed by specialists,for example, scientists and engineers.   Some of these - we hopean increasing number - will eventually come to be managers oradministrators in the field of their specialism.   But we see a continuing need in some departments for economic and financialadministrators who have been specially trained to apply their skillsto work of a high scientific and technological content, for example to the economic aspects of research and to the financial control of advanced technological projects.   Some of them, and we hope their number will grow, will have had scientific or technical training before they enter the service; and this will be of value to their^erstanding of the language and problems of their specialistcolleagues.   However, the primary function of the administrator in
-    185this field is not to duplicate the specialist knowledge of the-lent 1sts or engineer, but to apply his economic and financial skillsin a scientific and technological context.51.   The group of social administrators would be broader and moreheterogeneous than its economic and financial counterpart.    Inaddition to their administrative skills, social administrators shouldalso have training and experience in the social studies relevant to modern government.   These include a knowledge of the socialstructure, organisation and planning of communities and regions;methods of social investigation and the techniques of collectingand analysing information commonly used in public and privateenquiries into social problems; and of social administration,especially the structure of the publicly provided social servicesand the policy problems which arise from their development .   the emphasis in this training should vary, depending very much on theparticular social area of government concerned.    Clearly, mostsocial administrators will be concentrated in the main socialdepartments .of government.   But many will also be employedthroughout the Service.   For example, we would expect the personnel and organisation divisions of all departments to contain a proportionof social administrators.   There would also be jobs in the economicdepartments for which social administrators will be needed.   As withthe economic and financial administrators, the career pattern may involve service in more than one department, but normally within thearea of the social administrators expertise.52.  Though in each department there should be a suitable blend ofadministrators from both groups, they should not replace thosespecialists in their departments (e.g. engineers, accountants,economists, sociologists) whose primary concern is the practice oftheir specialism.   Thus the economic administrators in an economicapartment would not, for example, generally replace thosew&quot;0 are economists by profession.   The economic administrators&quot;HI not have the same depth of expertise, and will
be immersed in the day-to-day operations of the department in a way,nat   would &quot;be inappropriate for the specialist economist.    On theother hand, the employment of specialist economists in a department will not duplicate or make unnecessary the work of economicadministrators.    Besides making their contribution to policy-making,the economic administrators will be providing a great deal ofexplanatory information for Ministers, Parliament and the public:they will also be engaged in negotiation with outside interests;many will be involved in the administration of existing economic policies, for example, policies for the distribution of industry *Jobs of this kind do not need to be, nor should they be, handedover to specialist economists.    Indeed, a specialist economist whobecame immersed in these day-to-day problems of administration couldnot maintain the high degree of economic expertise   his workdemands.   Similar considerations apply to the relationships betweensocial administrators and the specialists with whom they work.    our aim is not to replace specialists by administrators, or vice versa.They should be complementary to one another.    It is, rather, thatthe administrator, trained and experienced in his subject-matter,should enjoy a more fruitful relationship with the specialist thanin the past, and that the Service should harness the bestcontribution from each.53.    The policy of grouping administrators which we have proposed isnecessary to enable them to gain the knowledge and experiencetheir work requires.   Within each group the depth of understanding,skill, knowledge and experience demanded will   vary with thelevel of responsibility.   The higher the responsibility of the post,the greater the understanding required of its occupant.    It isI therefore important that those who have entered the Service directpom school and have the ability to rise to positions of high&quot;ssponsibility should be given the kind of experience? and encouraged10 gain the qualifications, that they will need for this purpose.e are convinced however that professionalism, as we have described it,
1 -     187is not limited in its conception to work at senior levels.    It means$ he ability and the sustained effort   needed to ensure that each job,whatever its level, is performed to a constantly improving standard.The principle that every civil servant should be equipped to pursue this aim applies throughout.54     This grouping will also provide the necessary basis of knowledgefor a dynamic Service.   Civil servants who are more at home with themachinery of administration than with its content tend to be cautious- sometimes, even negative - ; a few, reacting the other way to v/hatthey do not fully understand, may well be rash.    Either because theylack training or have moved too frequently between jobs, they are oftennot equipped to conduct a fruitful dialogue with experts both inside and outside the Service.   Well-prepared innovation is more likely tocome from those whose grasp of their subject gives them a sureawareness of its possibilities as well as its limitations and fromthose able to talk with experts in their own language.    This is what our proposed grouping of administrators is designed to produce.55.   We do not wish that these two groups of administratorsshould be frozen into a rigid pattern for the rest of the century.They represent what we see as the present application of the guiding principle set out in paragraph 41; that those engaged in administrationi and management must not only be skilled in running the government machine, but must also have the basic concepts and knowledge relevant to their area of administration.    We propose these groups as astarting-point.    It should be the task of the central management ofI the Service to develop and refine them and to keep them up to date as the tasks of the Service change and develop.   But we are confident that the continuous application of this principle will provide forthe Service the necessary reservoir of trained talent and expertise.Prom these groups and from the specialists (as defined inParagraph 35) will also come men and women to specialise in the kinds of government work for which many different kinds of background and experience can be appropriate.     Examples are contracts work, computers
0   andM.,  personnel work and so on.    Such further specialisationft Wld be encouraged and it should be possible where appropriate forsome people to make their careers in one or other of these areas offurther specialisation.    For example, a social administrator or anaccountant might go on to specialise in 0.and M. work, moving in this field between departments to jobs of higher responsibility and eventually, perhaps after appropriate experience outside government,rising to the most responsible jobs in this field in the Service.57.    Prom all these professionals, administrators and specialistsalike,   will come the future top management in the Service .    Theywill be men and women experienced in running the government machine;they will have a basic expertise in one or more aspects of a department-1 s v/ork; and they will have been broadened by increasingresponsibilities and experience to become the fully professionaladvisers of Ministers    and managers of their policies.58.    The pattern of professionalism which we propose for the future will thus be based upon training and specialisation in the early years of a civil servant&apos;s career.    Some twenty years will pass beforethe Service is predominantly staffed by men and women whosecareers have been formed in this way.   We believe, however, that greatly improved standards of professionalism can be achieved in a muchshorter time by the present generation of civil servants.    This will need carefully planned posting and specially devised training; courses.   We revert to this in the section on training in the nextchapter.
a part of initial recruitment.   Where it is departmental,establishment comes later.CHAPTER 3 - -RECRUITMENT, TRAINING- AND CAREER MANAGEMENT59.   We have so far discussed the tasks of the Service and the professional skills they call for in its members.   We turn nowto the problems of recruitment, training and career development.60.   We begin by considering where the main responsibility for recruitment to the Service should lie and how far it should be delegated to individual departments or establishments.    In this context we make general recommendations designed to reduce thepresent length of the recruitment process.   We go on to the principles and methods that should apply to the recruitment of the various types of men and women the Service needs.    Finally, we turn to thequestion of post-entry training and career management.THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR RECRUITMENT61,   The central responsibility for recruitment is at presentdivided.   The Treasury is responsible for recruitment policy.The running of competitions, the selection of Successful candidatesand (in large part) their initial allocation to departments isin the hands of an independent body, the Civil Service Commission.In addition, some very numerous categories of staff are recruitedinitially by departments.   But in all cases the Commissioners mustissue a certificate for a civil servant to achieve permanentstatus*.   The Commissioners hold their appointments directly from theCrown and are appointed by Order in Council..   The justification forthis independence has been the need to ensure that all appointments to the Service are made strictly on merit and are clear ofpolitical or other patronage.   We consider, however, that thepresent arrangement is in need of fundamental revision.62.   We regard recruitment, training and subsequent careerdevelopment as parts of a single process to be as closely integratedaa Possible.   We believe accordingly that recruitment should beih the hands of those who also share a direct responsibility forig9I *0 ^e established.   Where recruitment is central, establishment
the individual^ subsequent training, deployment and development.a consequence, assessments of performance will be much more fully and directly fed back to those responsible for recruitment.These in turn will be better placed to adjust their criteria and methods as necessary; they will also have a much closer knowledge ofthe changing work and needs of departments.    In our view the Servicesuffers now from the separateness and consequent remoteness of theCivil Service Commission, which under the existing arrangementscannot know enough of the needs of individaal departments and is too little connected with the training and early management ofthose whom it appoints.63.   We recommend, therefore, that the Civil Service commission should cease to be a separate and independent organisation^.   Itshould become part of the new Civil Service Department, and its staff should be integrated with it.   Some of its functions shouldbe shared with the various employing departments in ways we discuss below,6k.   The selection of recruits should be, and should be seen to be,independent of any form of patronage.   But this is not incompatible with a much closer association between the selectors and boththe central management of the Service and the employing departments.We believe that the tradition of making appointments solely on meritis now well enough established to survive without keeping the CivilService Commission as a separate organisation; independence inselection can be assured by other means.   We do not wish to makea detailed recommendation; one. such means, however, might be to designate an individual senior officer in the Civil service department as First Civil Service Commissioner, and to give him the formal responsibility for final decisions on the selection of recruits.   It should be accepted no less clearly than in thePast that the First Commissioner would not be subjected to ministerial or parliamentary questioning over individual appointments.^he Commission now also recruit staff for the Diplomatic Service,jae House of Commons, the Government of Northern Ireland and anumber of &quot;fringe&apos; bodies whose staff do not form part of theeo+J Senrice&apos;   The Civil Service Department could, perhaps,continue to act for them on an agency basis.
-     19155,   We have expressed the view that some of the Civil service commission^ present functions should be shared with the variousemploying departments,   ^his is desirable because recruitmentshould be directly related to the needs of individual departments.They know the tasks they have to perform and are best placed toindicate the qualifications, training and experience needed.Therefore, we wish to see departments play a larger part in the recruitment process in two ways.66.  First, in drawing up the annual manpower budget fordiscussion with the Civil Service Department, each department should indicate as exactly as possible its needs at   all levels;both for the various kinds of specialist staff and also for thedifferent types and groups of administrative staff referred toin Chapter 2.   These needs (allowing for the necessaryinterdepartmental movement) would determine the pattern of recruitment.   Essentially this would be recruitment for specificranges of jobs,67.   Secondly, we think departments should have a greater influence on the selection of individuals.   We considered the case forhanding all recruitment over to the departments; but we rejectedthis on the grounds that it would encourage wasteful competition,place the less glamorous departments at too great a disadvantageand break up a Service which,-in our view, should remain unified.We think however that a higher proportion than at present should   --be recruited directly by departments,&apos;and that the employingde-DarTryipyita phnuid be better, represented in the recruitment processwhere it continues to be central.   We return to these proposals in more detail &quot;later in this chapter.RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES AND THE PROBLEMS OF DELAY68,   Another serious criticism of the present methods of recruitmentis that they are too slow in operation.   This criticism has arisenpartly because the Civil Service Commission has until recentlyinterpreted the principle of competitive examination as obligingit to wait until the whole of a very large field has been examinedend put in order of merit, no matter how outstanding a particularaPPlicant may be.      Various modifications made in recent years
* The following examples have been provided by the Civil service commission:-(a) Candidates for the Method II competition for theAdministrative Class, applying by the end of November, get their results between early March and May, depending onwhen they go to the Civil Service Selection Board.    (Mostmust then wait for their degree results In June or Julybefore the offer of an appointment becomes certain).(b) Candidates for the competition for direct entrant Principals(age limits 30-35) know their results between 9 and 19 weeks after the closing date for applications.   The average period between the notification of results and being able to startwork is 5$ weeks, ranging from 2% to 9 weeks,(c) For recruits to the Executive Class the average total period(on the basis of a sample taken in 1966) between application and being able to start work is 69 days, ranging from 30 to88 days.   Within this the average period between the notification of resulte and being able to start work is 23days, ranging from 11 to 43 days.have led to considerable improvements.   These have included - -&quot;continuous competitions&apos; for a number of important .. groups, e.g.Tax Inspectors and the relatively small number of ExperimentalOfficers who are recruited centrally.   But the process is stillapt to take too long.    It takes too long between application andthe announcement of the result of the examination; and between theresult of the examination and the time when successful candidatesare able to start work*.   Lengthy periods of waiting and suspenseare undesirable for those still attending school or university.For those who have left and who feel under pressure to startearning, they may be decisive in causing them to turn to other employment.   For those already in jobs, who are candidates forlate entry (often scarce specialists), they cause serious embarrassment, because of obligations to existing employers.69.   The Service will continue to face severe competition for talent.It cannot allow the survival of traditional procedures to place itat a disadvantage with industry and commerce, the nationalised industries and local government.    We recognise that when there are many well-qualified applicants for a small number of posts,competitions must continue.   But we think that the procedures of formal competition should be restricted to posts for which theyare indispensable; even then it should be made possible to offeroutstanding candidates rapid appointment.    Wherever qualifiedapplicants are relatively scarce, and it is in practice certainthat there will be posts for all suitable candidates, these should
jjQ brought in without delay, once it is clear that they are up tothe required standard; this is especially important in regard tothe recruitment of those with scarce specialist skills.   .....        19370.   We hope that the absorption of the Civil Service Commissionwithin the Civil Service Department will assist in bringing about these improvements.   The need to reduce to the minimum the interval between the results of competitions and the time when those who havebeen declared successful actually start work will partly be met bythe proposals about establishment that we make in the next chapter.In addition, we recommend that a review of the processes of recruitment should be put in hand in; addition to seeking ways of reducing the time they take, it should examine the problems of methods of selection to which we refer in paragraph 82 below and appendix E.THE PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF RECRUITMENTThe recruitment of graduates, post-graduates and their equivalents71.   Our proposals in Chapter 2 mean that graduates, post-graduatesand their equivalents should be employed, in their early years atany rate, either as specialists (architects, scientists, engineers,etc.) or in one of the new groups of administrators.    In either case,men and women should be recruited for a specified range of jobs.72.  This does not involve any basic change in the recruitment policy for specialists.   They are at present recruited for a clearly definedrange of jobs, and clearly defined, relevant qualifications aretherefore demanded. It would be an advantage if more of them&quot;ere already trained in management and administration and oould be equipped with the confidence and prestige of the French polytechnMensjqSome university courses are now beginning to recognise this need.Jn this connection we have noted the development of courses thatcombine engineering with economics, and science with economics; and! we welcome the sandwich courses at some universities that givescientists and engineers experience in industry and a grounding in9eonomics and business administration as well as a purely scientific0r specialist qualification.   This however is only a start; and0r the time being it must be the task of the Service to equipit8 specialists with the additional administrative, managerial and
other skills they need; we discuss this in our later paragraphs&apos;on training.$73,  Many specialist staff are now recruited direct by the department or establishment that is to employ them.   We think that this should become the normal rule.   Recruitment should be by interview before a board.   The board should normally include a kindred specialistfrom outside the Service and a representative of the Civil service department.   But the majority should be from the &quot;user&apos; department or establishment.   For certain specialists, recruitment may convenient^be done by departments acting together in groups or by the CivilService Department on their behalf.    This is a matter for decision from time to time between the Civil Service Department and theother departments.   But the essential need where scarce specialistskills are concerned is for speed; grouping and co-ordinationshould not be allowed to lead to time-consuming formality.Ik.   Our proposals in Chapter 2 for grouping administrators have,important implications for the direct recruitment of graduates,post-graduates and their equivalents for administrative work.   Theymean that in future men and women should not be recruited for employment as &apos; generalist&apos; administrators and intelligent all-rounders- to do any of, and a succession of, the widely differing jobscovered by the 1 generalist&apos; concept.    Instead, they should be recruited to do a specified range of jobs in a particular area ofwork, at any rate during their early years.    In Chapter 2 wedistinguish two broad categories of administration - the economicand financial, and the social.   It follows that the service should aim to recruit those with the best qualification, aptitudesand qualities for the jobs falling within one of these broad groups;for the later entrants relevant experience will also be animportant consideration.75.   Clearly, most recruits who come straight from their university*iU not on entry have the full range of knowledge and skillsSquired for work in one or other of the administrative groups.They will require in-service training and experience.   But   a
majority of us* consider that the relevance to their future work ofthe subject-matter of their university or other pre-Service studiesshould be an important qualification for appointment.76.   To give preference for relevance is to adapt to the   needsof today the old principle that the Service should seek to recruitthose it believes best equipped for work in government.    Whenthe aim was to recruit men and women to be intelligent all-rounders,the Service naturally drew heavily on courses like classics andhistory at Oxford and Cambridge which by their prestige have always attracted young people of the highest abilities.   these courses give an insight into the conditions of historical change and because for the most part the material they use is remote fromthe here and now they provide a &quot;disinterested1 intellectual training.Todays when the tasks of government have changed, the Service should seek to recruit those equipped for the new tasks.   First-degreecourses based on the study of modern subjects especially attractmany young people with a positive and practical interest incontemporary problems, political, social- economic, scientific and technological.   These problems will yield their solutionsonly to the most concentrated assaults of minds equipped throughrigorous and sustained intellectual discipline with the necessaryapparatus of relevant ideas, knowledge, methods and techniques.,We therefore wish the Civil Service to attract its full shareof young people motivated in this way, with minds disciplined byundergraduate (and post-graduate) work in the social studies, themathematical and physical sciences, the biological sciences orin the applied and engineering sciences.77.   There is also evidence that most undergraduates want jobs in&quot;hich they can make direct use of their university studies^.   Inord Fulton, Mr. W.C. Anderson, Sir Edward Boyle, Sir William Cook,Dr. Norman Hunt, Mr. Robert Neild, Mr. Robert Sheldon andSir John Wall,^ee Section 1.2 of the survey of undergraduate attitudes by the psychological Research Centre, entitled &quot;The Recruitment of graduates to the Civil Service&quot;, which we publish in *    *
-.. 196recent years the Service has not properly recognised this,   givingthe general impression that it is more concerned with the quality of a man&apos;s degree than its relevance to the work of government.This, in our view, has discouraged applications from graduateswhose interest and studies are focussed on modern problems.Thus post-war recruitment to the Administrative Glass has run counter to the increased trend in the universities towards the study of the problems of the modern world.   Therefore, to be attractive to this growing number of graduates, the Service should declareits special interest in the relevance of their studies.   In thisway, too, the Service would be attracting its recruits from a wider range of degree subjects than those from which administratorshave traditionally been drawn.78.    Though the ancient universities of Oxford and Cambridge have played their part in this growth in the academic study of the problemsof contemporary society, it has been most characteristic of the universities founded in this centuixy.   The date and circumstancesof their foundation have ensured that their courses have been mainly designed to prepare their undergraduates for work in a modernindustrial society.    To draw, more fully on this source of manpower,trained in these sub jects* would have many advantages for theCivil Service.    Our suggestions about possible ways in which this principle of preference might  work are set out in paragraphs 25-26of Appendix E.79.   We do not intend that our emphasis on &quot;preference for relevance&apos;should be read as a sign that we wish to discourage applications from those men and women of outstanding ability who have studied&quot;irrelevant1 disciplines.    The Service needs to recruit outstandinglyable men and women whatever the subject of their university degree.Our funcaraental aim is to secure for the Service the best man or^oman for the job,with the education, training and attitudesappropriate to it.   It follows that those appointed to theService without a &quot;relevant&quot; qualification should be requiredeither to:-va)   take a special training course at the new Civil Service
*See paragraph 99 below.i?ir Philip Allen, Sir James Dunnett, Sir Norman Kipping andLord SimeyCollege^ in addition to that provided for all graduatedirect-entrants to one of the two main groups ofadministrators;or (b) take a relevant post-graduate degree -or course of studyat the Service&quot; s expense at. some university or other appropriate institution.The choice between (a) and (b) should be determined by what is mostsuitable for the individual concerned in the light of the variouscourses available.80.   A minority of us/ take a rather different view.   We fullyagree that all administrators at the graduate level need a thorough grounding in the subject-matter of their work - whetherthey enter direct from university or are promoted within theService.   But we do not place the same emphasis on the relevanceof studies taken before entry.   On practical grounds, three of ussupport the proposals made in paragraph 83 below for a revisedMethod I competition based on examination in relevant universitystudies.  All fourthink however that the alternative selectionprocedure (Method II) should be impartial as between differentacademic backgrounds.   It is essential that the Service shouldattract to administrative work a large number of young men and women of outstanding ability and character.    Such people are naturallyin short supply.   We believe that if both methods of entry givepreference to those with relevant studies,, the field of selectionwill in practice be unnecessarily narrowed, and that this will involve a serious risk of defeating the essential aim.   Qurreasons for this are:-(a)   We believe that many able young men and women starttheir university course without having decided uppntheir future career, or change their minds in thecourse of it; and that many select their subject not
-198for career reasons but because they like it and are good at it*.   We do not think that the attractions ofthe Civil Service as a career are so outstandingby comparison with the other employments open tograduates that the Service can afford to discourage any source of supply.(b) At the moment, it is often necessary, in practice,for a grammar school boy or girl to decide as early as 13 years of age which subjects he or she wishes tospecialise in at the university.   A decision to givea preference to graduates with &apos;relevant&apos; universitysubjects could therefore tend to narrow still further the range of educational courses at a time when efforts are being made to postpone final and irrevocablechoices between them.(c) Many of the Service&quot;s main competitors for graduatetalent in this country recruit graduates on grounds of general ability and reckon to give them thenecessary training after entry.   Apart from notwishing to improve their competitive position at theexpense of the Service, we find it hard to believe thatthey are mistaken or that different considerations should apply to the CivH Service.(d) We do not at all decry the advantage of a previousgrounding in a relevant subject.   But we think thatit can be overrated,   A rigorous and disciplinedhabit of mind, which can be imparted by &quot;irrelevant&quot;as well as by &quot;relevant&quot; studies, is no less important,it the same time, we are impressed by the evidence thatthe best of the Assistant Principals who have not readeconomics at the university show up very well by theend of the course at the Centre for Administrative Studies&quot;Evidence for this may be found in Section 2 of the &quot;The recruitment of graduates to the Civil Service&quot;, published in Volume 3.
as compared with those who have.   We believe that   ,     &apos;&quot; yadministrators can achieve professionalism in theirchosen field of work (the need for which we whollyaccept) by means of the grouping we have recommended in Chapter 2 and the thorough post-entry training coursesrecommended later in this chapter,(e)   We are doubtful both about the proposals for the special training of those with &quot;irrelevant&apos; studies made inparagraph 79 and about the method of giving preference for relevance set out in Appendix E,   Both, in ourview, will puzzle and may well discourage potentialrecruits.81.   We are all agreed, however, that there is an increasing   needfor administrators handling the problems of modern government andthe techniques associated with their solution to be numerate.    Seniormanagers in departments will have to be able to handle problems withvariables that can be expressed only in numerical terms.    this need is general in all kinds of management throughout the country.We recommend that over the years an increasing importance shouldbe attached to the requirement that graduates seeking appointments to administrative posts should understand the use of numericaltechniques and be able to apply quantitative methods to thesolution of their problems.   We hope that curricula in schools and universities will gradually be modified to make this possible .We also wish to emphasise the value of familiarity with majormodern languages.    An increasing number of civil servants areemployed in work in which their effectiveness and understanding arehampered if they are confined in practice to English.82.   In general we think that all non-specialist graduates and theirequivalents should be recruited centrally by the appropriate sectionof she new Civil Service Department.     A   majority of us* consider thatPulton, Sir Philip Allen, Mr. W.C. Andersoames Lunnett, Dr. Norman Hunt, Lord Simey.erson, Sir Edward Boyle,
-    200should be two main methods of entry:- - -(a) Method I should, as at present, be primarily a written examiniation.   The papers candidates can offer, hwaever,should be restricted entirely to those with a directrelevance to the problems of modern government.   In any event, as we show in Appendix E, it is not practicable to maintain Method I in its present form.    We think it important to maintain a method of entry by written examiniation because we think it likely that some goodcandidates will come forward to compete by such a method. who would not choose to enter if the only method opento them were the extended interview procedure (Method II)which we discuss below; and that the former will offer some of them a way of showing their real merit more effectively.    We recommend however that Method I shouldbe retained, in the modified form we propose, on a trial-basis only.    If it fails to attract a sufficient number ofgood candidates, we should expect the Civil service department to abandon it.(b) Method II should involve a procedure based on that of thepresent Civil Service Selection Board.   We make recommendations in Appendix E however for changes inthe procedure and staffing of the selection process.Briefly, those of us who recommend preference forrelevance offer suggestions about how this might bedone.   We all propose in addition thot there should bea larger representation of employing departments among theselectors; and that their age distribution should be changed to increase the proportion of younger people.   We alsorecommend an inquiry into the methods of selection, toinclude such matters as the part played by the Finalauction Boara        possible Ways of ^ the processof selection more objective in character.
William Cook, Sir Norman Kipping, Mr. Robert Neild,Kr* Robert Sheldon, Sir John Wall.83.   These proposals should not be taken to imply that separateentry competitions should not in future be held for appointments tosuch groups as Tax Inspectors and Ministry of Labour cadets.These should continue wherever they are found to be most appropriate,selection being made either by the department concerned or by theCivil Service Department on its behalf.bV.   A minority^ of us consider that Method I should cease to exist altogether, for the following reasons:-(a) A written examination in the subjects studied by the candidate will be a repetition of the testing by hisuniversity.(b) Many candidates will be reluctant to sit two examinationsof the same kind.(c) It is hard to see how the Civil Service Department would beable to examine better than the university the wide range of subjects we consider relevant.(d) Advances in recruitment procedures are likely to bringsteady improvements in Method II,    It is here thattechniques of selection should improve fastest.(e) To retain Method I would be to keep a separate system of entry which in 1967 produced 18 successful applicants from5k candidates.   These numbers are likely to decline stillfurther.(f) If a certain number of entrants with very high academicattainments are required, Method II can provide for this byweighting the university record of the candidate.Method I provides no adequate test of other qualities.(g) The new Method I, because it is designed to cover in a fewpapers a very heterogeneous field cannot hope to examinecandidates in depth and is bound to come close to the broad test of knowledge of the modern world which the written papers of Method II, proposed in Appendix E,
-    202are intended to provide.   We can see no purpose in-keeping both.$      (hj   The argument for Method I is that Method II will deterapplicants who lack confidence in their ability to competein the social atmosphere of Method II.   If this argument;is sound, Method II should be revised.85,   We have said that each department should assess in detail the numbers and types of staff it needs.   This poses a special problem in the recruitment of graduates, both specialist and non-specialist.   We think it likely, for reasons we discuss in Chapter and Appendix F, that the Service will employ more graduates than atpresent, although the number of top posts in the Service may not showa proportionate increase^   It would be wrong for a large employerlike the Civil Service to seek to recruit more of the best graduatetalent than it can absorb and make proper use of now or in thefuture.   Matching graduates to jobs and prospects requires that departments should decide, in consultation with the Civil service department, on the level and kind of ability they require for particular types of appointment; the intake should be adjustedaccordingly.   All however should enter the same training grade(see paragraph 95 below), so that their fitness for different kinds of work can be fully tested after they have entered theService.   We attach great importance to ensuring that the early decisions which may shape a man&apos;s career in the Service (e.g.about different kinds of post-entry training or allocation todifferently graded jobs at the end of the training period)should be based on post-entry performance rather than pre-entrypromise.   We discuss this in more detail in Appendix F.86.   To underline the concern of the Service to recruit men andwomen of the highest calibre, we consider that those judgedoutstandingly able and well-qualified on entry should be offered8 starting salary two or three increments above the basic for &apos;.the entry grade.   This should apply to specialists as; well BBr-to  .the different groups of administrators.   This should not, however,
-    203carry the implication that senior posts should be reserved for those who start their careers with additional increments.    Thecareers of all entrants to the Service should be determined by-performance on the job.Recruitment of Non-Graduates87.   For most specialist posts, relevant educational and technical qualifications will also be needed by those who are not graduates.Men and women with   such qualifications as the H.N.C.  (which mayhave been gained after entry to the Service) or with &apos;A levels&apos; inscientific - or technical subjects should normally be posted tojobs for which their qualifications are relevant, whether thosejobs are purely specialist or in an related area of management.For administrative staff recruited at this level, specificqualifications and the relevance of the subjects   they have studied are clearly less important.    Their&apos;A level&apos; qualificationsmay be pointers to the direction in which they shouldspecialise.   More important, however, for all those recruitedat this age (specialist and ^non-specialist) is that they shouldbe given jobs that    match and stretch their abilities; they shouldalso be given the opportunity of developing the s&amp;lls andspecialisms the Service needs, including the ability to usequantitative methods.    Departments have a special responsibilityfor ensuring that the best of this age-group are picked out for early advancement and for appropriate further training.   We make proposals for this in later paragraphs of this chapter.88.   We recommend that non-graduate specialists should be recruitedby similar procedures to those recommended for graduate specialistsin paragraph 73.   For the non-specialist entry, we recommenddifferent procedures depending upon their age and educationallevel:-(a)   The 18-year-old entry (school-leavers with *A levels&apos;),corresponding to the present entry to the executive officer grade, should continue for the most part tobe recruited centrally by the new Civil Service department on the basis of&apos;A level1 results and interviews -
though there is scope for decentralisation on a regionalbasis.   We do not think that direct recruitment by departments is at present desirable at this level because:-(i) the non-specialist 18-year-old can have only a vagueidea of the work that different departments do and ofthe various career opportunities open to him in thevarious administrative groups.   He will need general guidance and advice on a wider basis than could beavailable to him at departmental level,(ii) to ensure a fair distribution of talent over all departments, the Civil Service Department must play a major role in the allocation of these new recruits.Individual departments should, however, be as closely associated as possible with the recruitment process,(b)   The 16-year-old entry (school-leavers with &apos;0 levels1)should continue as at present to be recruited by individual departments, though ad hoc groupingarrangements, particularly on a regional basis, haveobvious advantages.Late entrants and recruitment for short-term appointments89.   So far in this chapter we have been outlining a recruitmentpolicy for young people entering a career service; as we recommendin Chapter k, most of its members should enter the Service whenyoung with the expectation, though not the guarantee, of makingthe Service their life-time career.   But the Service should look for and encourage a considerably, larger number of late entrantsand temporary appointments for fixed periods than in the past.For late entrants of all kinds the prime factor in their appointmentsmust clearly be the relevance of the skills, qualifications and experience they already possess for the job or range of jobs inwhich it is proposed to employ them.   We envisage that some&quot;ould be appointed by one or other of the processes recommended inParagraphs 73 and 82 above; but it will be for the Civil service department to authorise special procedures where these are needed^ attract recruits of high standing or with scarce skills.
90R- /. \J \Jim MANAGEMENT OF NEW ENTRANTSoo.   Those who enter the Service at young ages should be properlylooked after and their development carefully planned.    In our view,the present arrangements are unsatisfactory, especially atExecutive Officer and Clerical Officer levels.91,   Our Management Consultancy Group found that young executive officers were sometimes confined to routine, undemanding work ofa lower quality than their educational qualifications justified.A Treasury study has found that 46$ of Executive Officers under theage of kO believe that their work does not fully use theircapabilities or enable them to develop their potential (Volume 3*no. 8).   Not surprisingly, therefore, there is a comparativelyhigh wastage rate among newly-recruited Executive Officers.    Asimilar situation is to be found among young Clerical Officers. TheManagement Consultancy Group drew attention to the fact that manyyoung Clerical Officers and Clerical Assistants are grossly under-utilised at present in jobs scarcely demanding the minimumeducational qualifications for ihejr grades.    The same Treasury studyhas shown that 53$ of Clerical Officers under the age of 40 considerthat their work does not fully employ their capabilities or enablethem to develop their potential.    We have seen no evidence on theextent to which similar problems may afflict young people incomparable employments outside the Service.    But the evidence thatthe Service is seriously mis-using and stultifying potential talentthese levels is disturbing, and urgent steps should be taken&apos;   tofind remedies.92.  At both these levels, the Service faces the problem of a wideage-spread.   The young Clerical Assistant or Clerical Officerentering at,, about 16 finds himself a member of a grade  thatcontains many older men and women, many of whom have entered theService in middle age.    Similarly the young Executive Officerentering at 18 enters a grade which consists as to 60$ of promotedierical Officers.   The numbers involved in a large department
if are very considerable, and it is a major problem of management toflake sure that the very different types of Clerical and executive officer are posted to the right kinds of job, and that youngentrants are kept interested and their potential developed.   TheService has in our view failed to solve this problem.93.   A necessary step seems to us to be a complete review of gradingat these levels designed to separate the jobs that are appropriate to the older civil servant whose aptitudes and experience fit him for the supervision of clerical and similar work, from thoseappropriate to the young entrant who with training and experienceshould be capable of rising in the Service.   We believe thatthere are at present too few grades for this purpose, and thatan increase in their number (which need not be great) should alsohelp to reduce the length of the Clerical Officer and executive officer pay-scales - at present a deterrent to the recruitment andretention of capable young men and women.   The proposal we make in Chapter 6 for a common grading system based on more rigorousmethods of job evaluation should be a major factor in bringing about this necessary change.%.   In addition, however, we think that departments will need to put much greater effort into personnel management at these levels.   New entrants should be regarded as being under training fortheir first three or four years.   They should receive more substantial induction training.    It would be the duty of the personnel management of the department to watch them all, assesstheir progress, encourage the good ones and admonish the indifferent.They should be guided to take additional qualifications appropriateito their field.   More specialised training should be provided as aptitudes and potential begin to emerge; the best of them should1Mn the training grade we propose in the next paragraph by the[time they reach their mid-twenties.95.  For the graduate entry, and for those who have shown thehighest ability among non-graduate entrants, we propose theProduction of a training grade.   Its object-should be to createf fast Promotion route for the most promising young men and women;lo tI test these young civil servants in jobs at different levels
of responsibility; and to provide a sufficiently extended period for their training.   The time spent in the training grade wouldbe variable; it might well differ as between a non-graduate entrantpromoted from below, a direct entrant to one of the groups ofadministrators referred to in Chapter 2 and a directly recruitedspecialist; depending on individual circumstances,it could be anything from two to five years.    We give further details in paragraphs 106 to 108 below.96.   In each case the destination of the trainee when he leaves thetraining grade should be determined by his ability and performancewithout regard to the claims of seniority; it is essential tothe concept of a training grade distinct   from the general gradingstructure., that trainees should go straight from it to the leveljustified by their performance.   Our proposal for a training gradedoes not however imply that a recruit should not have a fullyresponsible job while he remains in the grade.     Onthe contrary, it is partly intended as a device to enable him to begiven the maximum responsibility he can shoulder, to try him out indifferent jobs, and at the same time to see that he gets thetraining and opportunities appropriate to his case.     We see it andthe proposals we have made in paragraphs 93 and 3k as an explicitaffirmation of the Service&apos;s intention to give special care and earlytraining to those young men and women who are capable of rapidadvancement.TRAINING97.   Great efforts have been made in recent years to increase theamount.of training that civil servants receive.   The total trainingeffort is now, therefore, impressive - particularly vocational,training.   There are very thorough courses, for example, for thoseNho have to be schooled in the intricacies of the social securityregulations or for those who have to be taught particular skillssuch as contract procedures or computer programming.   But, theseapart&apos; *here is little certainty that the subjects and techniquesPeople are taught on training courses will actually be relevantor applicable to their work.   This is hardly surprising when,.a8*Q have pointed out, the practioe of the Service hitherto
has been to move staff at frequent intervals from one field of      208activity to another.   Moreover as our Management Consultancy Groupsakes clear, many administrators and specialists have receivedinadequate training (or none at? all) in techniques of modernmanagement.98,   We have said that in the more professional Civil Service of thefuture it will not be enough for civil servants to be skilled inthe techniques of administration: they must also have a thoroughknowledge of the subject-matter of their field of administration and keep up to date in it.   Thus training should be designed to equipadministrators to operate in one or other of the broad groups wehave referred to in Chapter 2.   Similarly^ specialists need to beeqtipped to an appropriate degree for administration and management in addition to their normal Skills in their specialism.99.   In order to achieve this a&amp;30e&amp;&amp;K*r we propose the creationof a Civil Service College.   We See the College as fulfilling three main functions.100,   First, the College should provide major training courses in administration and management.   These should include(a) courses for specialists (e.g. scientists, engineers,architects) who need training in administration and management both early in their careers and later;(b) post-entry training for graduates directly recruited for adminsitrative work in the economic and financial or sofeialareas of government;(c) additional courses in management for those in their 30&apos;sand l+O&apos;s moving into top management;(d) refresher courses in the latest management techniques.(e) courses for the best of the younger entry to help them to compete with the graduates;Some of the courses should be wholly or partly residential.10s&apos;  Secondly, the College should provide a wide range of shorterI raining courses for a much larger body of staff.   These shorterj courses would be in both general management rand vocational subjects;they 8hould be designed for all levels of staff and particularlyjtor the more junior.   We think it likely that such central
courses   could train civil servants more economically and to a high standard in some fields than can be achieved by separate departmenttraining; we recommend, therefore, a review of the balance between central and departmental training to assess the possible extentof such a change.102.   Thirdly, we think that the College should also have two important research functions.    It will be uniquely placed to conduct research into problems of administration and those ofmachinery of government.    In addition, however, we hope thatthe Planning Units in departments, which we recommend in Chapter 5*will commission the College to undertake specific research intoproblems of present or future policy on which they need assistance.Publication and&quot; open discussion are important to research; the college should encourage this to the greatest possible extent.103. This combination of major teaching and research functionsshould enable the College to fulfil a role that   we believe is greatly needed.    It should become a focus for the discussion ofmany of the most important problems facing the Civil Service asa whole - discussion in which we hope that many outside theService will share.101...   We do not attempt to prescribe exactly where the two kinds oftraining courses should be provided.    We think it important however that the major courses, including those that are residential,should be concentrated in a single establishment large enough to be the natural centre of training and research withinthe Service.   It need not necessarily, as we see it, be inLondon - indeed, there would be some advantage in its being outsideaut it should be close enough to London to be accessible without difficulty for leaders in many walks of life.   The shorter courses for the larger student body on the other hand will need to beProvided in London within easy reach of Whitehall and the mainrsnge of government offices.   A large, non-residential centre willbe needed.   It may well be that this willr have to be physicallyseparate from the main establishment, because of the difficulty ofProviding teaching accommodation for a very large total student-I 0oy in one place; unless the residential establishment is quite
near the centre of London, the other should in any case be- 210separate.105.   It would not De appropriate for us to try to lay down theaxact scope and content of the courses to be provided by the CivilService College.    In the next three paragraphs, however, we givea broad outline of the way training in the future should in our viewassist, both in providing the new professionalism we have sought to prescribe and in giving ample opportunity for every civil servant fully to develop   his talent.106.   Young graduates recruited into the training grade for one ofthe administrative groups referred to in Chapter 2 should, after an appropriate induction course, spend an iritial period of up t0two years in their Departments, either at headquarters or, wherever possible, for some of the time in local or regional offices.   Duringthis period they should be placed in one or two different jobsselected to test their ability and aptitudes and develop their capacity  * to take responsibility.    We attach importance to givingas many as possible the experience - more than can be gained fromsight-seeing visits - of working in the places and at the levelsat which the Civil Service meets and dealswith individual membersof the public.   Once they have passed probation (see Chapter k ,paragraph 143), they should embark upon their main formal training.This should last for up to one year, but it may well be appropriate to divide it into two or three approximately equal parts.    Wethink that the course should contain four main elements:-(a)   Further training in the subject-matter of the variousadministrative groups, designed to relate the concepts ofthe fields concerned (economic and financial or social)to the practical problems of government.   The course for Assistant Principals at the Centre for AdministrativeStudies now gives such training in economics; thereshould also be courses to cover the social field.   Asfar as possible, both should be adapted-to theneeds of the individual, by taking into account the qualifications he already possesses in his chosen field and by providing in whatever way is most appropriate
for special study of subjects handled by his particular department.(b) The techniques of modern management, including staff organisation and management and the uses of numerateanalysis as a tool for dealing with management problems.(c) More advanced and specialised training in the applicationof an individual&apos;s specialism to his particular field of activity.(d) The machinery and practice of government and administrationincluding relations with Parliament, public corporations,and local authorities.We expect that the weighting and timing of these fwtr broadelements will vary between individuals.   Not all will be of the type to get most benefit from advanced theoretical training.   Equally,not all will need to make the same detailed study of the machinery and practice of government.   Some will need training at relativelygreater depth in management techniques.   We do not wish to lay down any rigid pattern in what should essentially be a flexibleprocess designed to meet the needs of the individual, theadministrative group in which he is working, and the requirements ofhis department.   Between the parts of his training course, andafter it is over, the graduate should spend some further time inhis department, still under training but undertaking more responsiblework.   During this period also, as many as possible should gainexperience of work outside the Service - in local government or private or nationalised industry as is most appropriate. We discuss this further in Chapter 4 and Appendix G.   At some stage too, all should have practical experience in the supervision and control ofstaff.   For some there may also be a spell in a Private Office.Ths whole process should take up to 5 years, after which thegraduate should be posted to the grade and level of jobcommensurate with the ability he has demonstrated since joining the Service,   The outstandingly able graduate who has enteredwithout a relevant qualification for his administrative group18hould start the proeess after one of the additional courses ofc training outlined in paragraph 79 above.
we are proposing for the graduate entrant to administrative work a crowded programme of training - on the job, in formal^courses, and on attachments designed to broaden his outlook.We recognise that this involves the risk of trying to do too muchin too short a time and of preventing young entrants fromsettling down to a sustained job of work.    To counter this, theprogramme should be flexible.    We do not wish to insist that everyentrant   should go through the whole of the process we have outlined before he leaves the training grade; in some cases itmay be appropriate that attachments and loans should take place ata rather later stage.   But such variations should not be allowedto upset the general objective of giving the graduate entrant hisprofessional training as soon as possible after he enters theService, so that he can make a fully effective contribution inthe field of his specialisation during the early years of hiscareer.108. The arrangements for young gradaates recruited to the traininggrade as specialists should not follow any single pattern.   Muchwill depend on their particular field of expertise - whether, forexample, they are scientists, engineers, architects or economists.Much will also depend on the requirements of the job they have been recruited to do.   In any event, after an initial introductionto the work of the department or establishment, most will be puton the particular job for which they have been recruited.   Wethink that in most cases they will wish to concentrate on their particular line of specialist activity for some time.    It may,however, become clear after a period that an individual is moresuited to a different type or level of job; the fact that he isin a training grade will facilitate his transfer to this.   Itmay well be, too, that the requirements of a particular professioninvolve obtaining further qualifications or experience; some may9 obtainable in the Service, some not.   In any event we envisagethat many specialist lgraduates should, after a few years in theService, go to appropriate management courses at the Civil ServiceCollege.   por some        emphasis will be on the organisation ,andcontrol of staff, for others on the techniques of management and
financial control.   After the completion of auch courses, and. inany case within three or four years, the specialist 3hould beDosted to the grade and level of job commensurate with the abilityne has demonstrated since joining the Service.   Thereafter wethink that many should be selected to return to the Civil ServiceCollege at the appropriate stage for longer and more generalcourses in administration and management, to qualify them for the wider role we have proposed they should play.109,   The 18-year-old entry, both administrative and specialist,should be encouraged to take additional qualifications appropriate to their work (diplomas, H.N.C. etc.).   Many of the training andfurther educational facilities needed for this are available inthe general educational system of the country.   We recommend thatbursaries&apos; and paid leave should be made available for thoseattending such courses.   These should be supplemented as necessarywithin the Service through the shorter non-residential courseswe have proposed.    In addition to this, however, those ofthem who are engaged on, or are expected to go on to, managementwork; will need training, and we recommend that the best of these9hould be picked out to join the graduates on the courses proposedin paragraph 100 above.    Short central courses could be a usefulaid to selection for this purpose.110.   The proposals we have made so far relate to the new entrants of the future.    The Civil Service College will also need to provide immediately for the present generation ofcivil servants, many of whom have had little training since theyfirst entered the Service.   This constitutes a major transitionalproblem which must be energetically tackled if the professionalismthe Service needs is to be achieved, and to prevent the older andyounger members of the Service from being separated by a damaging gap.   Besides building up its courses for new- entrants,before, the College will need to put in hand a rapid and large-scale programme for the further training of the present generation,and especially of those who entered the Service before recentMovements in the training programme began.

Thereafter wethink: that many should be selected to return to the Civil ServiceCollege at the appropriate stage for longer and more generalcourses in administration and management, to qualify them for the wider role we have proposed they should play.109.

Besides building up its courses for new entrants,before, the College will need to put in hand a rapid and large-scale programme for the further training of the present generation,snd especially of those who entered the Service before recentImprovements in the training programme began.
111,   The course provided by the Civil Service College should notbe restricted to civil servants.    Indeed, we hope that on manyof its courses a proportion of the places will be set aside for menand women from private industrial and commercial firms, localgovernment and the public corporations.    In our view, the Collegehas an important part to play in laying the foundations for agreater understanding between civil servants and the outside world.112.   At the same time, the Civil Service College should not attemptto provide the total amount of training required by civil servants.First, departments should continue to run their own courses, thoughthe Collage will have a part to play in giving advice and guidance.Secondly, we think it most important that more civil servants should attend courses at universities and business schools, not only because of the intrinsic value of their curricula but&apos; also again to help to ensure that civil servants are not isolated from theircounterparts in other employments.   Many courses, especially thosedesigned for the particular needs of the Service, must always be mounted internally.   But wherever appropriate courses areto be found outside the Service, we hope that full advantage willbe taken of them.113.   A College operating on the large scale we propose will obviously need its own full-time teaching and lecturing staff.   Butin our view the College should also use on a part-time or ad hocbasis civil servants and a substantial number of teachers andinstructors drawn from a wide range of institutions of higher education (including the new schools of business administration).They should also come from industry and commerce, nationalised industry, and loca\ government.   We hope that the Service willassociate with the work of the College the widest possible rangeQf interests that can contribute something of value to theGaining of civil servants.The Civil Service College should be under the general direction of the Civil Service Department which will be responsiblef0r the training policy of the Service as a whole.   We consider,however, that the College should have its omn governing body,
consisting not only of civil servants but also of men and womendrawn from a wide range of interests outside the Service - fromShe universities, polytechnics and business schools, from private and nationalised industry, and from the trade unions andlocal government.    This will help it to remain outward-lookingand keep it in touch with the needs of the rest of the country.CAREER MANAGEMENT115.   During the early years of a man&apos;s career we expect him toremain within the specialism or group for which he is trained.This does not mean that he must stay in one job in one department;he should move between jobs and perhaps between departments butusually within the area of his specialism.   As far as the administrator is concerned, he should move at much less frequent intervals than he does now.    While there will be a great variety of individual career patterns, the basic principle of careermanagement should be a progressive development within a specialismand between fields of activity that    are related to each other.While the needs of the Service must come first in this, nevertheless the personal interests and wishes of the individual should betaken into account more positively than appears to be the usual practice at present.   This increased attention to personnel management and individual career planning should apply tospecialist no less than to administrative staff; in our view much too little of the limited effort that has been put into personnel management in the past has been devoted to the specialists.    Thiswill clearly place much greater demands on the personnel and organisation branches of departments, which will need to be expanded to meet them.   And, as we explain in Chapter 7, it willal30 mean that the Civil Service Department must play a muchbigger role in this respect than the management side of thetreasury does now.n&amp;.   The right; promotion at the right time is an essential partof the process of developing to the full the talents of the menand women in the Service.   In our view, the present promotionAstern has serious weaknesses.
117.   First, at the middle and lower levels there is too muchemuhasis on seniority.    Seniority is given much less importanceat higher levels.   But to the extent that this does occur there,it is correspondingly serious.    It is in our view of the greatest importance that those who are really able should be appointed toAssistant Secretary and parallel ranks at an early age.   There is evidence that there are civil servants, both administrators andspecialists, below these ranks who are now frustrated by being given too little responsibility; this is particularly true fromthe salary level of about  2,500 downwards.    Seniority will doubtless&apos; always count for promotion in the Civil Service as itdoes elsewhere; this is right when it reflects experience that wJLlbe of value in posts at higher levels.   But there should be moreopportunity than at present for the exceptionally able to moverapidly up the system.   We believe that the pressure to giveundue weight to seniority within a given field of work should be relieved by the widening of career opportunities, and that thereshould be a change of emphasis in the assessment of staff so that more weight is given to performance on the job measured againstset objectives.   We think that the proposals we make in Chapter 6for a new structure based on job evaluation will facilitate this change.118.   The second main criticism we make of the present system isthat it does not allow promotion to be sufficiently closely linked to the individuals ability, aptitude and qualificationto do a particular kind of job at a higher level.   The main reasonfor this is that promotion is based on, and restricted by, thecivil servant&apos; s membership of his class.   We develop this pointfurther in Chapter 6.A system in which promotion is based on past performance andsuitability for specific jobs should also help to ensure that undueimportance is not attached to the candidates performance before aPromotion board.   It should be evident to all that this is not the^cisive factor.   The primary job of a promotion board should be*0 Produce a fair and uniform judgement of individuals&apos; promise
*0ne of us (Dr. Norman Hunt) also recommends that J ^^^2* state or Parliamentary Secretary should be a member of this committee.His presence is necessary for two reasons.   Ministers should bemore closely associated with these senior-level^promotions which will do much  to determine the tone and attitudes of the department.Secondly, it is particularly important tbat promotions at these levels should not become too&apos;much based on &quot;in-bred&quot; Civil Servicevalues and attitudes; the Minister will be able to contribute the&quot;outside&quot; detachment ;which can do something to check 1hieand performance based primarily on the assessment by theirdifferent superior officers of their performance in their presentjobs.120.   We also recommend a change in promotion procedures.Promotion boards at present deal with promotions up to chief executive Officer and equivalent levels, but promotions abovethese levels are the result of informal consultations.    We considerthat for promotions to posts at the level of Assistant Secretary,Under Secretary, and their equivalents, the Permanent Secretaryof the department should be assisted by a small committee (i.e.a &quot;paper board&apos;).   We think that the Committee should alwaysinclude one of the specialists in the department.*   We alsorecommend in Chapter 7 that a representative of the Civil service department should be a member of this committee when promotions to under Secretary level are being considered, to help to ensureas far as possible that policy and practice are uniform across theService.   In Chapter 6 we distinguish a senior policy and management level for this purpose.121.   Two final points about the status and staffing of the branchesresponsible for personnel management and organisation.   The first is a matter of terminology.   These branches are generally called&quot;establishment divisions&quot; and their work is known as &quot;establishmentwork&quot;.   This word now carries implications of stuffiness andwe believe it to have bad effects both upon the status of thework and upon the way it is done.    We recommend that itshould be used no longer.   In the rest of our report we refer to &quot;personnel and organisation&quot; divisions or branches; the Servicemay be able to find a better name.
-    218122.   Secondly, these branches and those who have served in&quot; them have suffered, both because the work has not generally been regardedas an avenue to promotion to ithe highest posts in the Service, and because the staff have not developed sufficient expertise.   our proposals, if accepted, will enlarge their future responsibilities and thus improve their status.    This should help to attract thosewho are capable of rising to the highest posts.   At the same time this work will call for high expertise and thus for greaterspecialisation.   We welcome this prospect.    We wish   to addtwo riders.   Those specialising in personnel work should fromtime to time get experience of work in this field outside theService.   They should also have experience of working in &quot;operating&quot;divisions and of the effect of personnel and organisation   workupon them.
CHAPTER UMOBILITY, PENSIONS AND A CAREER SERVICE123, In Chapter 1 we criticised the lack of contact between theCivil Service and the rest of the community.    This is partly the consequence of a career service; since we expect most civil servants to spend their entire working lives in the Service some degree ofisolation is almost inevitable     The concept of a career service hasalso been criticised because of the sense of almost total security of tenure that it gives to all established civil servants.     Thus though there are provisions for dismissal and for premature retirement inthe interests of efficiency, both are in practice rare - and, in themiddle and senior grades, very rare.    In 1967 dismissals and compulsory retirements of permanent staff in the grades of executive officer (and equivalents) and above on the grounds of misconductand inefficiency numbered 22 (0.015 per cent of the permanent staffin these groups).    In the previous four years the figures were1963 196U 1965 19662h 2h 25 20We find it hard to believe that these figures should not have beenhigher.   On the other hand, there are strong arguments for preservinga mainly career service in the sense that most civil servants should enter when comparatively young with the expectation, but not theguarantee, of a life-time *s employment.    .ve consider them in detaillater in this chapter and in substance accept them.    Nevertheless weare convinced that, both in the public interest and also for the health of the Service itself, effective steps must be taken to ensure a very much larger and freer flow of men and women between theService and outside employments than there has been in the past.   TheProposals in this chapter are designed with these ends in view.LATE ENTRYl2lj,. Late entry should be considerably expanded.   There are people in business, the professions, nationalised industry, local governmentand the universities whose experience would be most valuable to theService.   The need is particularly obvious in the specialist
disciplines such as engineering where men are needed, with practical experience of kinds that the Service cannot alv/ays provide.    Inthese fields there is already some late entry; there should he more.But more late entry is also needed on the administrative side (whichas we define it includes the present Executive Glass) where atpresent it is sporadic and unduly restricted.    For example, there isno regular late entry into the Service between the ranks of executive Officer and Principal.   Recruitment to the Executive Glassis now restricted to the Executive Officer grade; and no startingsalary can be higher than the salary point for 25-year-olds.    Inthe Administrative Glass late recruitment (leaving aside special provisions for serving and former members of the Armed Forces and overseas Civil Service) is mainly to the Principal grad.e , though there is also provision for the late entry of up to three assistant secretaries a year.    This was started only in 196k,when six Principalswere recruited (35 in 1965, 27 in 1966 and 30 in 1967); so farthere have been no more than five late-entry Assistant Secretaryappointments.    (One of the reasons for the small number of assistant secretary appointments is that they are made only if the specificqualifications and experience needed cannot be found within theService.)   This is very far from enough.    In our view there shouldbe no restriction on the levels to which suitably qualified and experienced people from outside the Service can be directly appointed.A stecdy inflow of suitably-qualified older entrants with new ideas and relevant experience would, we believe, bring great benefitsthroughout the Service.IMPORARY APPOTNTMttWTHl25. At middle and higher levels, there should also he more short-termaPPointments for fixed periods; this would help to maintain regularmovement in and out of the Service.    It would be particularlyVahiable in the case of those specialists, for example   someengineers and scientists, whose special contribution would heUP to-aate knowledge and practical experience of work outside0vernment.    it is also often the best way of using the talents of
MTOO -1those, again mainly specialists, who are needed in an advisory capacity.   For example, the present system by which professionaleconomists come into the Service from the universities for a fewyears and then return, perhaps to come back again for further spellslater, has been of great value.    We think that it should be adoptedin other specialist fields.    In the various administrative groupssimilar short-term appointments for those with relevant experience inI industry, commerce or the universities could also bring advantages,s 126. In addition to temporary appointments of this kind, it hasbeen put to us that the Service also needs to employ people whosestatus is expressly temporary but of indefinite duration.    in total the number of temporaries is very large: 12h,000 or 29$ of thejtotal non-industrial staff.   The great majority are in the lowerI grades (for example, there are 37,500 temporary Clerical Assistants)I and there is a rapid rate of turnover.   But there are many temporary1\ appointments at higher levels and temporaries continue to beemployed on this basis for long periods - some for over 20 years andI until they reach the retiring age.   A number of reasons are given whyI many civil servants are temporaries&apos;.   Some prefer for their ownreasons to enter on a temporary basis or to become temporaries after% a period of established service, e.g. retired persons or marriedM women.   Others, recruited when pressure was urgent, have been offeredI only temporary posts because they did not possess the full^qualifications needed for permanent appointments.    The largest groupI are those whose jobs are themselves temporary because the need forthem is not expected to last.i27. we doubt if the Service is justified in employing as many as of its staff on a temporary basis.    In so far as i t remains necessaryto employ temporaries for indefinite periods, we make recommendationsf on ^8 terms of service that should apply- in their case in paragraphs137 and 143 below.   We consider, however, that the service should fin(j means of reducing the proportion of temporary staff, andshould in particular examine ways of ensuring that civil servantsI flo not continue to serve on a temporary basis for unduly long periods^
128. Determined efforts are needed to bring about  the temporaryinterchange of s taff with private industry and commerce, nationalised industry and local government on a much larger scale than hitherto,pr-time experience proves beyond doubt the value of such movementin promoting mutual knowledge and understanding.   Coming at theright stage, experience in a changed environment can also be ofdecisive importance in the individual^ development.    Interchangeshould be a two-way process (though not necessarily head for head)covering both administrative and specialist staff from the level of higher Executive Officer and equivalent upwards.    Efforts are beingmade to promote these exchanges at present.   We welcome the scheme,started in 1965, under which about 25 nominees from industry, commerce and the universities were loaned to the Service for a two-yearspell as Principals.    We hope that it can be continued and developed.But it is at least as valuable for civil servants to go out for aspell.   No doubt there are real obstacles; no doubt it is extremelydifficult to spare g ood civil servants,  especially at the level ofPrincipal and upwards.    At 1st December, 1967 only 30 civil servantswere away on secondment to industry, commerce and local government.We cannot believe this is the most that can be managed.    We developthis point further in Appendix G.PERSONAL APPOINTMENTS BY MINISTERS129. Several times in recent years Ministers have brought inprofessional experts and advisers of their own.   These have beenPersonal appointments in the sense that they have been individualstoown to the Ministers concerned, who have judged that their individual qualities and experience could be of special help to themm their departments.   We welcome this practice as a means of bringing new men and ideas into the service of the State.   We aresatisfied that a Minister should be able to employ on a temporarybaeis such small numbers of experts as he personally considers heneeds to help and advise him.   They should be men and women of8tanding and experience.   We consider however that this practice should
-     223be put on to a regular and clearly understood basis.    *ve think itinappropriate to propose any precise limitation qf the numbers of^these appointments or any defined procedures.    But it should be made clear that such appointments are temporary and that the person concerned has no expectation of remaining when there is a change of minister.MOVEMENT OUT QF THE SERVICE130. The corollary of more late entry into the Service should bea similar flow out of the Service.   We think that it should be ofthree kinds.131. First, however well the Service is managed, there will always be able men and women who decide for personal or other reasons thatthey wish to leave the Service for another kind of work.   At presentthe pension arrangements make voluntary severance difficult.   We donot believe that restrictive pension arrangements are the rightway to keep staff - even those with scarce skills whose departureis a real loss to the Service.    It would be highly regrettableif civil servants did not have valuable contributions to make toother areas of our national life; it should be natural for others to wish to employ them.132. Secondly, we consider that the Service should take the systemof probation much more seriously than it appears to do at present.Out of the Assistant Principals who entered from 1961 to 1965, 221passed their probation and only four failed.    While no doubt thegreat majority of men and women can be expected to be confirmed intheir appointments at the end of probation, the present almost complete certainty of passing successfully through it is not anadequate spur to effort.133. Thirdly, the Service should have wider powers to retire on pension those who have ceased to earn their keep, and should use themwith more determination.   Where culpable inefficiency is in question,tne present powers seem adequate, though we suspect that they are not always used as fully as they should be.   But wider powers are alsoneeded to deal with the small minority who, perhaps through no fault
be put on to a regular and clearly understood basis. .*e think itinappropriate to propose any precise limitation qf the numbers of)these appointments or any defined procedures.   But it should be made clear that such appointments are temporary and that the person concerned has no expectation of remaining when there is a change of minister.MOVKMENT OUT OF THE SERVICE130, The corollary of more late entry into the Service should bea similar flow out of the Service.   We think that it should be ofthree kinds.131. First, however well the Service is managed, there will always be able men and women who decide for personal or other reasons thatthey wish to leave the Service for another kind of work.   At presentthe pension arrangements make voluntary severance difficult.   We donot believe that restrictive pension arrangements are the rightway to keep staff - even those with scarce skills whose departureis a real loss to the Service.    It would he highly regrettableif civil servants did not have valuable contributions to make toother areas of our national life; it should be natural for others to wish to employ them.132. Secondly, we consider that the Service should take the systemof probation much more seriously than it appears to do at present.Out of the Assistant Principals who entered from 1961 to 1965, 221passed their probation and only four failed.    While no doubt thegreat majority of men and women can be expected to be confirmed intheir appointments at the end of probation, the present almost complete certainty of passing successfully through it is not anadequate spur to effort.133. Thirdly, the Service should have wider powers to retire on pension those who have ceased to earn their keep, and should use themnth more determination.   Where culpable inefficiency is in quest ion,the present powers seem adequate, though we suspect that they are notalwaye used as fully as they should he.   But wider powers are alsoneedea to deal with the small minority who, perhaps through no fault
O O Anf their own, have unforeseeably ceased to be able to reive aBsatisfactory performance and ought to be retired early in theinterests of the Service - on fair terms (see Appendix.H).^rjVU^StiRVIGE AS A CAREER134. We have recommended a much greater flexibility of movement between the Civil service and other employments.   We think however that it should remain a career service in the sense that most civilservants should enter at young ages with the expectation, but not theguarantee, of a life-time &apos;s employment; and that the great majorityof those who come to occupy top jobs will In practice be careercivil servants.    There are in our view substantial reasons why this   *should continue to be so:-(a) Our avowed aim is to create a Civil Service that is trulyprofessional - expert both in the subject-matter and in themethods of public administration.   Long experience andaccumulated knowledge are essential parts of this concept.While it involves   a   constant inflow of new men andideas from outside, it must also involve for the majoritya professional career in the Service.(b) Civil servants must be able to give forthright advice totheir superiors and to Ministers without fearing that a clashof views might lead to dismissal from the Service.(c) Really able young men are more likely to come into the Serviceif they know that the top jobs are open to them; if too manyof the senior posts were filled from outside the Service,this would produce frustration among those already in theService and discourage recruitment.(d) At a time when there is greater intermingling between thepublic and private sectors, and when the decisions of civilservants are of immediate concern to firms and other organisations, we want to see a substantial increase in the flow of staff, both long-term and short-term, between theService and commerce and industry.   But this should takeplace in a professional atmosphere fostered by the fact thatthe majority of civil servants expect to remain in the Service
for a life-time&apos;s career.   It is important that civilservants should not come to think of those who do business with their departments as their prospective employers, andthat firms, which are increasingly reyuJr ed to reveal their technical and financial affairs to government, should beable to do so with confidence.IgRMS OF SERVICE AND PENSION^ ARRANGEMENTS135. We thus propose greater mobility into and out of a service thatstill continues in the main to be a career service.   As a consequence,important changes need to be made in the Service &apos;s pension arrangement and the terms on which civil servants are employed.136. At present the rules of the pension scheme greatly restrict the sort of movement we wish to see.    ,Vhile there is a well-developedsystem for transferring pension rights in moves between employmentsin the public sector, this does not extend to moves between theCivil Service and private employment.   A person who enters theService from private employment cannot transfer his pension rightsinto the Civil Service pension scheme and thus continue to build up a continuous pension entitlement (though he may be able to preservehis rights in his old scheme); and a civil servant under 50 and belowthe rank of Assistant Secretary who by his own choice leaves to go toa private employment loses his pension rights altogether.   Clearlythis is a serious impediment to movement both into and out of theService,   we recommend therefore that the Service should, wherever practicable, make transfer arrangements with private employers tofacilitate late entry, and that all civil servants who have servedfor an appropriate qualifying period should be able to transfer orPreserve their pension rights on voluntarily leaving the Service.137. Most temporary staff are now unpensionable, though a small number are members of the Federated Superannuation System for-universities*   We think that every person - subject to having servedya specified qualifying period - should be entitled to a pensionElated to the length of his service.   We therefore recommend thatPension scheme should he extended to cover temporary staff.
1^8. rte also believe that the Service needs wider and more flexiblepowers than those provided in the present superannuation Act in tworespects: -(a) to provide reasonable severance arrangements for those wnoare obliged to retire in the interests of the service before they reach the normal retiring age, as proposed inparagraph 133;(b) to offer improved pension arrangements where these are needed to attract into the Service individual late entrantswith special ability, qualifications or experience, who areunable because of the shortness of their prospective periodof service to earn a good pension by the time they reach theretiring age.139. The present pension scheme is non-contributory.    It could besuitably adapted to give effect to the proposals in paragraph I36 and137 above.    .,e think, however, that it would be marginally easier todeal with short periods of service, and that other advantages would accrue, if the scheme were put on to a contributory basis.   Thisproposal has been made more than once before, notably by the TomlinCommission in 1931, but has never been proceeded with.    V.&quot;e understandthat the basis of the Civil Service pension scheme, as indeed of allpublic-service pension schemes, will need to be re-examined when theproposed system of National Insurance retirement pensions related to earnings is introduced; and that the question of contributions is bound to be reviewed in that context.   We hope that this review willbe speedily conducted and will take full account of the arguments infavour of a contributory scheme.lk0. The recommendations in paragraphs 136 to 139 above are discussed in greater detail in Appendix H.kl. We now turn to the terms on which civil servants are employed,rind m particular to the question of established status.   The originmeaning of establishment are set out in a note by the Treasury,*hich we publish at Volume h, Section IV.   Briefly, an established civilisation 8ervant   is (in most caSes) one who has been admitted to the Civil
Service with a certificate from the Civil Service Commissioncertifying that he satisfies the conditions laid down for hisaDpointment); and only those who have been so certificated arepensionable.   Established civil servants have much greater securityof tenure than unestablished.   We have recommended above that the link between establishment and pensionability should be broken.   The[question is whether the concept of establishment should then remain.Ih2. In our view, it should he abolished.   The term Establishment&apos;has acquired overtones of comfort and complacency, and damages the reputation of the Service.    More important, the concept of establishedstatus has engendered an atmosphere within the service that inpractice, though not in theory, offers too much protection.    It is nottrue that a civil servant, once established, is completely secure inhis job, however lazy or inefficient he may be.   But establishmenthas come to imply a presumption of security until retirement , whichgoes beyond what is genuinely needed and, we believe, hampers the elimination of the small minority who do not earn their keep.1113. In our view, the new terms of employment required to producegreater mobility into and out of a largely career service are asfollows: -(a) por all appointments, except the temporary staff discussed inparagraphs 125 and 126 above, there should be a two-year period of probation.(b) On successful completion of probation an individual shouldbe informed of this by letter and offered indefiniteemployment, subject to a reasonably long period of notice:we suggest up to six months on each side.    The Service shouldbe able to end the employment only on one of the following grounds : -(i) redundancy, in circumstances in which he cannotappropriately be found a comparable job in anotherbranch or department;(ii) ill hea 1th;(iii) disciplinary reasons s.u ch as misconduct orunreasonable refusal to move to another job in the
Service when mobility is one of his conditions ofservice;(iv) culpable inefficiency;(v) early retirement in the interests of the Service, asproposed in paragraph 133.In each case there should be appropriate safeguards for theperson concerned.    We have not examined the procedures,formal and informal, that now govern (i) to (iv), andtherefore have no changes to propose.    We discuss theprocedure appropriate to the new proposal at (v) inAppendix H.(c) The temporaries at paragraphs 125 and 126 above should,wherever possible, be offered short-term appointments for a specified number of years.1UU.. We think that the process of confirming a civil servant in his appointment (paragraph lh3(b) above; should be handled in a way thatreduces the administrative complications now involved in the processof establishment.    First, it should be delayed until successfulcompletion of the probationary period; this should help to speed uprecruitment, delays in which are today partly attributable to the procedures for establishing successful candidates.    Secondly, thereshould be considerable delegation of authority.    At junior levels(i.e. below the level of the graduate entry), we think that theemploying department should determine that a person has successfullypassed his probation and confirm him in his appointment accordingly.It should however report each case to the Civil Service Department,^di should watch over the general standards observed by individual departments, and should conduct soot checks to see that standardswe being maintained.     At the graduate entry and higher levels, theauthority should be the Civil Service Department.    At the end of theProbationary period, a department recommending a recruit for^firmation should submit a report stating that he has the necessary: purifications and is showing satisfactory performance and adequateI ?romise for his grade.
CHAPTER 5THE STRUCTURE OF DEPARTMENTS AMD THE PROMOTION OP EFFICIENCY1ji6,   To function efficiently, large organisations,  includinggovernment departments, need a structure in which units and individual members have authority that is clearly defined and responsibilities for which they can be held accountable.      There should be recognisedmethods of assessing their success in achieving specified objectives.li^6.   The organisation of a government department today usuallydefines with great clarity the area of a civil servant1 responsibility;    his position within his hierarchy is also clearlyestablished..     But it is not easy in the Civil Service clearly anddistinctly to allocate to individuals or units the authority to take decisions.     There are two reasons for this.      Decisions often have tobe referred to a higher level than their intrinsic difficulty orapparent importance merits;    this is because they involve theresponsibility of the Minister to Parliament and may be questionedthere.    At the same time, many problems overlap departments;    theyoften involve wide consultations at many different levels both between departments and with a variety of interests outside the Service.Decisions therefore are frequently collective decisions achieved through a sequence of committees - culminating, if need be, in the collective responsibility of the Cabinet.11*7.   For these reasons clear delegation of authority is particularly difficult in the Civil Service.     This has led well-informedobservers, including some who have given evidence to us, to conclude that large-scale executive operations cannot be effectively run by government departments, and that they should be &quot;hived off&quot; wherever-Possible to independent boards.     We discuss this suggestion in the(concluding section of this chapter.     We believe, however, that thelwork of departments can be so organised as to enable responsibilityland authority to be defined and allocated more clearly than they oftenare at present.     Individuals and units could then be called to account for performance which is measured as objectively as possible.
in our view, this is true in different ways of many sides of adepartment1 s work.     We consider this principle of organisation to hea necessary condition for achieving maximum departmental efficiency and lor enabling men and women to get the greatest satisfaction fromtheir work.11+6.   There can be no standard pattern of cepartmental organisation to achieve these ends.     The responsibilities of government depart-ments are extremely diverse.     Each department, therefore, has toorganise its staff in the way most appropriate to its own tasks.Nevertheless, there are certain common elements in the work forwhich the top-level direction of each department has to provide.Our proposals concentrate on four of these:-(a) The management of the departments executive activities,many of them laid down by legislation.      These constitute the work of most civil servants and vary widely.     they include, for example, much research and development work,all kinds of procurement, the management of technologicalprojects and programmes, inspection and monitoring workof many kinds and the management of social services,  suchas the running of employment exchanges and national insurance offices.(b) Administrative activities, mostly of a non-executivecharacter, concerned often with the operation andadaptation of existing policies.     Examples of these arehigh-level case-work arising from the detailed applicationof policy, exercising the departments financial controls over its expenditure, and dealing with the wide variety of problems arising from the services administered bylocal authorities (education, housing, roads, town and country planning, etc.)(c) The day-to-day organisation of the departments staff and work and the provision of its internal services (i.e, thework of personnel and organisation divisions).
(d)   The formulation and review of policy under politicaldirection.I49.   The precise application of our recommenaations to these broadaspects of aepartmental work will differ from department to departments     They will, however,  involve substantial cnanges in thepresent basic pattern.      In particular, for each major department i(and, where applicable, smaller ones) we recommend:-(a) the organisation of executive activites in such a way thatthe principles of accountable management can be applied.(b) the provision of high-level management services;(c) the creation of a long-term planning Unit or Units;(d) a top departmental structure in which, while overalldirection under the Minister must rest unequivocally withthe Permanent Secretary, there should be closely associatedwith him a Senior Policy Adviser or Advisers,  and, where appropriate, a chief scientist, engineer or other seniorspecialist.ACCOUNTABLE AMD EFFICIENT MANAGEMENTISO.   Accountable management means holding individuals and unitsresponsible for performance measured as objectively as possible.      Itsachievement depends upon identifying or establishing accountable unitswithin government departments - units where output can be measuredagainst costs or other criteria, and where individuals can be heldpersonally responsible for their performance.!51o   The establishment of such units must involve an addition to the^Service&apos;s traditional accounting methods.      The present system of voteaccounting does not automatically provide complete cost figures forthe work and expenditure of individual divisions and branches or  .for particular activities;    only recently have arrangements been introducedln &amp;ome departments to supplement the formal parliamentary accountscost data of this kind. Accountable management requires the   wentification of those parts of the organisation that form convenient
939 .. wgroupings (or &quot;centres&quot;), to which costs can he precisely allocated asthe responsibility of the man in charge.     We regard this as essential to systematic management control.152.   There is a complementary need to establish for the samegroups and units standards of achievement by which their performancecan be judged.     Clearly this is more easily done in some parts ofthe Service than in others.153o   Wherever measures of achievement can be established inquantitative or financial terms, and individuals held responsiblefor output and costs, accountable units should be set up.     Webelieve this to be practicable over a very wide area of the executivework in paragraph 148(a).      M. ch of this work is done in establish-ments outside headquarters:   some is nation-wide.     The moststraightforward cases are where there is a physical output, e.g.  instores or sup^lieso      But it is also possible to measure outputagainst costs wherever a large number of similar and definedoperations are performed.     For example, in the registration of applications, the payment of benefits and the handling of individualemployment problems, local offices could establish standards of achievement by using the statistical data they already collectrelating to transactions handled.     At present this information is largely used to determine the number and type of staff required;it eould be used to measure the comparative efficiency of differentunits.     These accountable units would correspond to the &quot;budgetcentrec&quot; which have been widely developed as an instrument ofmanagerial control in progressive industry.154.  Work of this kind should thus be organised into separate&quot;commands&quot;.     The manager of each command should be given clear-cutresponsibilities and commensurate authority and should be held^countable for performance against budgetss standards of achievementm other tests.     Within his unit he should set up sub-systems ofresponsibility and delegated authority on similar lines.
^5.   Diffe^1^ considerations apply to much of the administrative work mentioned in paragraph lk8(b).     Here measurable output cannotalways be made the criterion for assessing performance.     one cannot lay down in advance how long it should take to revieweffectively the investment programme of a nationalised industry, orto study and make a sound recommendation on the acceptability of a proposed company merger.     The assessment of administrative work isalso complicated by the unpredictable demands   that arise from theMinister1 s responsibility to Parliament, and by the fact that much ofit contains a major element of new policy-making, involving consulta-tion, negotiation and the preparation of legislation.156.   It is still, however, important that those engaged on administratively-ive work of this kind should know what their objectives are and thattheir performance should be judged by their results.     The principle to be applied here is management by objective.     Whether the branchis primarily concerned with administering existing policies(paragraph lk8(b) above), with planning new policies or withresearch, its objectives and priorities need to be clearly established.To some extent, of course, many branches work in this way now.But the principle of management by objective is not applied assystematically or widely in the Service as it should be.     It shouldhe normal practice everywhere for heads of branches doing this kindof work to agree with their superiors and subordinates the tasksassigned, relative priorities and dates for completion, and regularly to review progress.     Individuals at all levels should know what theyare responsible for and what authority they have.     The effectiveness of the branch and the contribution of its individual members could then be more objectively assessed.Further changes in the way in which many departmentsorganise their work are also needed if the principles of accountablemanagement are to be applied as fully and as widely as they ought tobe*    Three main obstacles at present stand in the way of the effective allocation of responsibility and authority.
-.  234158.   The first of these arises when several departments, oreveral branches within a department, have a substantial interestin the same problem.     With responsibility diffused, the need forwide consultation may mean that all can move forward only at the pace of the slowest.     This limitation is inherent in much government work.    Despite this, it should be possible, especially where theproblem is reasonably self-contained, to devise methods of concentrating in one man or group the responsibility for organising the relevant material and putting forward a solution.     Whereproblems. involve several departments, it may often be the right course to set up a team.     This is, in fact, often done now.     Thereis however too much of a tendency at present for members of groups of this kind to try to carry their departments with them at eachstep of the way.     We feel that more specific allocation ofresponsibility to individuals, both departmentally and inter-department ally, is needed.  The interests of many different ministers are often, if not usually, involved.     Nevertheless, the problem-solving approach, has great value,  since it reduces the temptation to&quot;pass the buck&quot;, and it can do much to develop the competence and confidence of the individuals concerned.     We recommend that departments should make opportunities for adopting it whenever theycan,159*   Another general obstacle to the clear allocation of personal responsibility and authority frequently arises from the number oflevels in the hierarchy of most Whitehall departments.      Usuallythere are at least seven organisational levels in administrative&quot;ork (from Executive Officer to Permanent Secretary), rather morethan there would be in a typical industrial situation; and spansof control (i.e. the number of subordinates reporting directly toa superior) are very narrow, usually only two or three.     Similar1 arrow spans of control are found in other hierarchies, e.g. in the0r8ani8atiOr. of much engineering work.     Often, from Executive OfficerUP*rds, each level &quot;has a go&quot; at a paper or a problem, adding.^conBsents0r 8u8gestions as it goes up the hierarchy until it reaches the
 . \J Jpoint at which somebody takes a decision.     This point is oftennigher than it would otherwise be because decisions may involve theMinister in having to answer for them in Parliament.      In consequence,personal responsibility and authority are obscured;    delay follows.We think that the number of working levels in the traditionalorganisation of the flow of business should be reduced.     Thelevel or levels omitted will obviously vary in different situations.Much more often than now, for example, an Executive Officer should work direct to a Senior Executive Officer, or a Principal direct toan Under-Secretary.     With &quot;flatter&quot; structures there can be a more precise allocation of responsibility and authority.     We think theService ought to make bold experiments in this direction.160.   The third obstacle arises in those areas of the Service whereadministrators and specialists (e.g. engineers, architects,quantity surveyors and planning officers) are jointly engaged on acommon task like the design and preparation of military installations and the supervision of their construction by outside contractors.Where this happens, the two main systems of organisation at presentare known as &quot;parallel hierarchies&quot; and &quot;joint hierarchies&quot;.     in parallel hierarchies, the responsibility is bisected;    financialand overall policy control   is entrusted to administrators organised in one hierarchy, while advice on the technical merits of a case andthe execution and development of technical policy is laid tospecialists organised in a separate but parallel hierarchy.     InJoint hierarchies, an administrator and a specialist are designatedjoint heads of a block of work, but at lower levels   the &apos;separation of functions still occurs, with f financial control in the hands of theadministrators.     The way these arrangements work is described in more detail in the report of the Management Consultancy Group.*  We are aware of the advantages claimed for these forms ofJrganisation, but we are satisfied that they are outweighed by theirVej?y considerable disadvantages.     They produce delay and inefficiencybecause of the need for constant reference to and fro between the
hierarchies,.     They prevent the specialists from exercising thefull range of responsibilities normally associated with theirprofessions and exercised by their counterparts outside the Service.In particular, they obscure individual responsibility andaccountability;   no single person at any level has clear-cut managerialresponsibility for the whole task.162,   These common tasks frequently include a large volume of non-technical work - some of it routine, some of it requiring considerableexpertise, e.g. in preparing legislation and regulations and in thefinancial procedures of government.     Nevertheless we consider thatthe best organisation for this kind of work is a single integratedstructure, under a single head.      The head of the structure should bethe man with the most appropriate qualifications for the job.Beneath the single head, administrators and specialists should beintegrated in teams or unified hierarchies, where individual postsare filled by administrators or specialists according to therequirements of the task.     Part of the Ministry of Technology alreadyoperates on the basis of a unified hierarchy incorporating all necessary technical, financial, administrative and other specialiststaff.     The speed with which this new pattern can replace joint andparallel hierarchies throughout the Service will depend on the availability of men and women with the right training and experience;it will take time to find and develop the skills required. ^DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT SERVICES UNITImplementing the proposals we have so far outlined would not by itself be enough to guarantee full efficiency and the maintenanceof the highest standards of management.     The Service will also need to devise the right machinery for ensuring that each department keepsits organisation up to date, conducts a regular audit of its efficiency, and constantly applies the best available methods andtechniques to its tasks.     The use of outside consultants could help^d the central management services of the new Civil service department should be an effective spur.     But the primary&apos;e8Ponsibility must lie with the department itself.     Thus
I ^departmental personnel and organisation d ivisions have a key role toplay.    These divisions are primarily concerned w ith personnel and efficiency and therefore have a powerful influence on the totaloperation of departments at all levels.     We discuss their role in personnel management in Chapter 3.     Here we concentrate on their task of promoting and maintaining efficient organisation and methodsof work.I6I4.   Although the Civil Service has played a major part in thedevelopment of organisation and methoos (0. and M.) in this country,the work of departmental 0. and M. divisions in promotingefficiency is at present often inadequate.     The findings of ourManagement Consultancy Group indicate that the reasons for this areas follows :-(a) 0. and M. staff tend in practice to focus on methods tothe exclusion of organisation, and too rarely questionwhether a particular task actually needs to he done atall.     Normally, there is little, if any, investigation ofwork ahove the lower and middle levels of a department.There is, too, the serious weakness that the staff employedon this work (nearly always members of the ExecutiveClass and not normally above Senior executive officer) have not the rank or authority to operate effectively at higher levels.(b) 0. and M.  investigations begin for the most part only byinvitation from the head of an operating division when hedecides that he has a problem.     Some departments conductplanned reviews of selected areas but the current emphasis is on ad hoc assignments.     And when such assignments (orreviews) have been completed, 0. and M. staff usuallydo not sufficiently participate in seeing their recommendations put into effect.(c) The separation of staff inspection (assessing the numbersof staff required for the efficient performance of a given
o 716amount of work) and 0. and M.  (analysing the tasks andthe methods &quot;by which they are performed as well as theorganisation required for the purpose) divides what shouldbe a unified operation.     We are aware that these separateresponsibilities usually converge at the Under Secretarylevel.      It is the separateness of the two actual operationsthat we are criticising.     We acknowledge that there areoccasions when a limited rather than a full-scale operation is all that is required, for example to investigate a request for one or two additions to a division&apos;s staff;but this cannot justify the present separation,(d) . The staff engaged in 0. and M. and staff inspection work are not sufficiently expert;    they are frequently&quot;generalists&quot; who, because they spend too short a time onthe job, lack the necessary qualifications and experience.165,   In our view, each major department should contain a management services unit with wider responsibilities and functions than are given to 0. and M. divisions today.     In particular, we should like to see the following changes:(a) Efficiency audits should be introduced involving all aspects of the departments work at all levels.     Thisshould take place as part of a constant and phased reviewof the total operation of the department.     In particular,special attention should be paid to studies designedto improve organisational efficiency.(b) The management services unit should be fully and clearlyresponsible for promoting throughout the department the use of the best management techniques.(G)   0. and M. should be equipped to operate effectively at all levels in a department and not just at the middle and lower levels.U)   The functions of 0. and M. and staff inspection should be assimilated and combined in the same unit;    this would
mount operations of varying scope and depth according tothe nature of the problem.l66.   The management services unit must be properly staffed.      Itcannot carry these enlarged responsibilities if it consists ofinexpert general administrators assigned to the unit as part of a regular three to four-year rotation between widely differing jobs.The work demands specialisation from men and women with highqualifications.     The staff should be drawn from the groups ofadministrators referred to in Chapter 2, from appropriate specialists,including accountants, and from those with experience of similar work outside the Service, including some with practical experienceof management in industry.     Many should spend long periods - in somecases the better part of their careers - in this type of work,gaining additional qualifications and experience, moving between different departments, including the Civil Service Department, and between the Service and similar work in other employments outside.167.   The qualifications and training of the management servicesstaff of the Civil Service must compare favourably with those doingsimilar work outside, e.g. in large management consultancy firms.Many should have a relevant degree or equivalent professionalqualification and not less than five years&apos; experience as manageror administrator in an operating division.     This needs to be followedmore specialised training in management techniques and a greatfoal of refresher training subsequently.     There is almost no-onenow in departmental establishment work with qualifications and experience of this order.168, our proposals are not intended to discourage departments fromDrinSing in outside consultants for special assignments.     Departments,iave done this to an increasing extent over the last few years.^ ^ in our view a necessary supplement to the work of their ownmanagement services units;    it will help to keep the units themselvesiJlly up to date and it can be of particular value when problems of0rSaihsation arise at the highest levels within departments.
q,   it is important that the creation of stronger management services units should not detract from the responsibility of membersof operating divisions for their own efficiency.     The primeresponsibility for the efficiency of their work must rest withthem.    The role of the management services unit snould be to give any assistance that is needed and generally to act as a spur to the achievement of higher standards.170.  We are convinced that the creation of management services unitsof this kind in departments is the only way to ensure that allunnecessary work is eliminated and that staffs are kept to the absolute minimum.     We believe that there are substantial, savingsetobeachieved by such units, staffed and operating in the way we have described.     These units too should themselves be subjected to anexternal efficiency audit about every five years;    it might be doneby a team drawn partly from central management services and partly from outside management consultants.171.  We wish to draw special attention to one other factor whichis a source of inefficiency at present.     Office services (notablysecretarial assistance) are frequently inadequate.     Much more needs to be done to improve the physical surroundings in which civilservants work.     Conditions vary widely;    some are lamentable.Squalor is not conducive to pride in the job.     We discuss this further in Appendix I.POLICY FLAMINGi?2,  We emphasised in Chapter 1 the growing need for long-term planning if the problems of modern government are to be foreseen,and the groundwork for decisions prepared, in good time.     We believethat this responsibility, like the complementary responsibility forj     execution of policy, needs to be more clearly defined and allocated..  Present policy-making, especially long-term policy thinking andinning, is the responsibility of officers over-burdened with more^mediate demands arising from the parliamentary and publiciresPonBibiiitie8 0f Ministers.    The operation of existing policies,
and the detailed preparation of legislation with the associatedgotiations and discussions, frequently crowd out demands thatappear less immediate.      Civil servants, particularly members of theAdministrative Class, have to spend a great aeal of their timepreparing explanatory briefs, answers to Parliamentary Questions, and ministers&apos; cases.     Generally this work involves the assembly ofinformation to explain to others (civil servants, outside bodies andso on), the policies of the department, how they are operating, and how they apply in particular cases.     Almost invariably there areurgent deadlines to be met in this kind of work.     In this press of daily business, long-term policy-plannirg and research tend to takesecond place.173,   We propose that a departments responsibility for major long-term policy-planning should he clearly allocated to a plannirg and research unit.     In the rest of this c hspter, we call these&quot;Planning Units&quot;.     Research is, however, the indispensable basis of proper planning, and the phrase should be understood as referring toa unit equipped to assemble and analyse the information required forits planning work.     The unit should be relatively small.      its main task should be to identify and study the problems and needs ofthe future and the possible means to meet them;    it should also beits function to see that day-to-day policy decisions are taken withas full a recognition as possible of their likely implications forthe future.     The Planning Unit should not carry any responsibilityfor the day-to-day operations of the department.      It will, however,he important to ensure that it does not become too much detached fromthe main stream of the departments work.     In some departments,e*g* the Home Office, with widely separated fields of activity, itmay well be that more than one ^Manning Unit should be set up.The staff of Planning Units should develop close contacts withthe appropriate experts both inside and outside the Service.     TheyBhould De aware of, and contribute to, new thinking in their field.
They should also be trained in, and have the capacity to use, the L&quot;n Lrelevant techniques of quantitative analysis.J7[jt  we think that Planning Units should be staffed by comparativelyyoung men and women.     Thus some of the most able, vigorous andsuitably qualified young civil servants will be able to have an early and direct impact on top policy-making, as they do so impressively in france and Sweden.     Planning Units also offer scope for the employmentof men and women on short-term contracts or temporary secondment to thegovernment service.     By offering these opportunities both to youngcivil servants and to Outsiders&apos;! Planning Units will help to generatethe thrust and drive that are needed;    they should also provide anenvironment in which those who possess qualities of imagination andforesight can be identified and developed.176.  We think that people should not normally remain in these unitsbeyond their mid-forties (except for the head of the Planning Unit --e paragraph 182).     After a period of service in Planning Unitsthey should then expect to move - some returning to w ork outsidegovernment, others into the operating sections of their departments.177.  Many of the problems handled by Planning Units will have implications-tions extending beyond the boundaries of a single department.     these units may therefore need a measure of central direction if theemerging problems of the country are to be tackled systematicallyland comprehensively and on the basis of common major hypotheses.IThe status and location of this central direction, whether by the^Cabinet Office, the Treasury or the development of other machinery, is&amp; question of machinery of government and therefore beyond our terms ofreference.I!HLOVERALL DIRECTION OF DEPARTMENTSjp.  The proposals we have made so far in this chapter have important implications for the highest levels of responsibility in departments.Nay, responsibility at the top is concentrated in the PermanentJecretary,    He has four functions.     He is the Minister1 s mostrsMediate adviser on policy;   he is the managing director of the day-c&quot;% operations of the department; he has the ultimate responsibilitylor questions of staff and organisation; as the,.Accounting Officer (in
nearly every department), he also has the ultimate responsibilityfor all departmental expenditure.x79.   This is a heavy burden.      In some departments (the Treasury,Ministry of Defence, Board of Trade and Ministry of Technology),the post of &quot;St-cond Permanent Secretary&quot; has been introduced.     Wehave strong doubts about it.     It attracts a salary of  8,100 -  500below the Permanent Secretary and  1,800 above the Deputy Secretary.The role and status of the Second Permanent Secretary have never been satisfactorily defined:   he is below the Permanent Secretary, butnot far enough below to occupy a clear position in the chain of command.     If, as we propose in Chapter 6, a common grading structureembracing all   the present classes is introcuced,  special attention should,in our view, be paid to the grading of posts at this level.180.   We believe, however, that the present structure of departmentsneeds reinforcing and diversifying at the highest levels.     no permanent Secretary would claim to be equally skilful at all aspectsof his job.     However much he delegates, the day-to-day service ofhis Minister (including helping to deal with the political squalls ofthe moment) must take priority,  and this often prevents him from giving his full personal attention to the long-term objectives and planning of his department.      We have already drawn attention to thelengthening time-span of government work and to the increasingemphasis on forward thinking that this demands.      Top managementoutside government is everywhere increasingly concerned withanticipating the needs of the future;    it is vital that such forwardthinking in the Service should not be impeded by the constant pressure to deal with the needs of the moment.181,  Our proposals for accountable management and for enlarging the role of departmental personnel and organisation divisions will inevitably add still further to the burdens of the Permanent Secretary.He will have to devote more time to his managerial function - to bethe spearhead of the constant drive to improve the efficiency of hisApartment at all levels and among the various accountable units;an(*i with the greater emphasis on career management that we recommend,tne Permanent Secretary&apos;s responsibility for the selection and movement of staff will become even more important and demanding.
-   -244182.  We consider therefore, that in most departments, if not all,there should be a Senior Policy Adviser to assist the Minister.&apos;&quot;This adviser should be head of the Planning Unit.     His prime job,like that of the Unit, would be to look to, and prepare for, thefuture and to ensure that aay-to-day policy decisions are taken withas full a recognition as possible of likely future developments.He should be an authority in the department&apos;s field of activity.Where a department s responsibilities are so varied that no singleadviser can be an authority on all of them, he would be a specialistin a major part of the departments work;    the other specialismsrequired might be included in the Planning Unit*.     It would be thejcb of the Senior Policy Adviser, like his staff, to know the other experts in the field, both inside and outside the Service, at home andabroad;   he should be aware of all the important trends in new thinkingpractice that are relevant.   We hope that the adviser would often bea relatively young man.      (We think that considerable advantages aregained in France and Sweden from the system by which the average ageof the French directeurs du cabinet is 1+6 and of Swedish under-secretaries, lib-     The average age of Permanent Secretaries in britain is 56.)    On occasions he might be appointed by the Minister from outside the Service to give a new impetus to its forward thinking.More often, however,   we&apos; should expect him to be a   career civil servant with a long experience in, and expert knowledge of, thefield covered by the department,    though we think it would beI advantageous if he had also had some experience outside .m 183.  For the proper discharge of his duties; we consider that theX Senior Policy Adviser must have direct and unrestricted access to his1 dieter, both personally and in writing.     He should also be free tom4f,v,t -he necessary to have more thanAlternatively, in s ome cases it m^ht be necessary rtffient toI       such adviser.     The precise pattern may dillerirom^I   department but the basic concept is of .a-d^^^e5 from1   or units with one or more heads ,- but all detached from forresponsibility for day-to-day operations and charged wiwi ythe future.
determine? after consultation with the Permanent Secretary butSubject only to the approval of the Minister, what problems hisBlanning unit should tackle.     While the adviser should have thechief responsibility for planning the longer-term departmental policy,he should not have responsibility for the day-to-day operations ofthe department;    these should remain under the direct control ofthe Permanent Secretary.l8ho  We have considered what the status of the Senior PolicyAdviser needs to be if he is to fulfil most effectively the roledescribed.     Much will depend on the way the Minister wishes toorganise his top-level advice.      The Permanent Secretary, as we have said, will have enlarged responsibilities for managing his staff and for the efficient organisation and running of the department.We do not wish to make specific recommendations about his rank,provided that it is clearly understood that he should have thestatus commensurate with his being the Minister&apos;s main adviser on long-term policy questions and on their implications for the day-to-day policy decisions that have to be taken.     This suggests to us that his rank should not normally be below that of a deputy secretary *     To find the right solution needs experiment;   no doubt the long-term pattern should vary according to the needs of different departments at different times.165.   In some of the big technical departments there may well be acase for a further top post.     For example, where a department is engaged on large-scale scientific research or on major building orengineering projects, it might he right to appoint a chief scientistora chief engineer to be in charge of these operations.     His job&quot;ouldhe to take the chief responsibility for the direction ofthe department&apos; b technical work;    he would have direct access to theMinister as his main adviser in these matters;   he would also he theI Professional head of the specialist staff.     In exceptional cases there might be a need for two such posts.
lS5   we do not propose that these senior officers, together with thepermanent Secretary,  should constitute a formal board.   The working^arrangements should he informal and variable from department todepartment and from time to time;    different Ministers&apos;   individualwayB of working will do much to determine the pattern.187,  In ^ event* we consider that there should be one person who has the overall responsibility under the Minister (subject to the reservation about long-term policy in paragraph 183) for all the1 affairs of the department, and that this person should, as now, be thepermanent Secretary.     He has the main responsibility for the day-to-day service of the Minister and for accounting to Parliament for expenditure.     He cannot discharge these responsibilities unlesslie is ultimately in charge of the departmental machine.      InI1 carrying his responsibilities for current operations, he cannot loseI his concern for their long-term policy implications,&apos;   just as theI Senior Policy Adviser must have some concern with current policy issues.    The Permanent Secretary therefore should still be head ofthe office under the Minister.     At the same time,  our proposals aboutSenior Policy Advisers and chief    specialists should provide - -Ministers with a wider range of expert advice at the highest level thanIt present.THE DELEGATION OF RESPONSIBILITY TO AUTONOMOUS PUBLIC BOARDS188, We return now to the question referred to in paragraph 11+5,jfoether there are areas of Civil Service work that should be &quot;hivedloff from the central government machine and entrusted to autonomousPublic boards or corporations.      It has been put to us thataccountabla management is most effectively introduced when an activity is separately established outside any government department,Pd that this solution should be adopted for many executive activities,specially the orovision of services to the community.     Theseboards or corporations would be wholly responsible in their ownI       within the powers delegated to them.     Although they would bej.Cutoide tne day-to-day control of Ministers and the scrutiny of&quot;^-lament, Ministers would retain powers to give them directions when
necessary.     There are a number of commercial enterprises withinthe public sector   that are already run on this principle,    and itis also shortly to be applied to part of the Civil Service by&quot;hiving off&quot; the Post Office.      There are also non-commercialactivities in the public sector   that are similarly organised, foreXairple, the Atomic Energy Authority.139,   We have seen such a system operating in Sweden where theprinciple of &quot;hiving off&quot; is much more widely applied than has so far been attempted here.     In Sweden central departments deal in the mainwith policy-making;    they are quite small and are predominantlystaffed by younger men.     The task of managing and operating policiesis hived off to autonomous agencies whose senior staff are mainlyolder men of mature experience.     This system is used not only for activities of a commercial kind, but also for public services in social fields.     We were much impressed by it.     On the other hand,we are aware that in the United States the application of the&quot;hiving-off&quot; principle, as evidenced in the w ork of the independentregulatory commissions, has attracted a good deal of criticism.190.  Much new policy is a development of that which already existsand springs from practical experience in its operation.     Anycomplete separation of policy-making from execution c ould thereforehe harmful.     However this does not appear to happen in Sweden, and we see no reason why the risk should not be provided against.     There is indeed a wide variety of activities to which it might be possible toaPply the principle of &quot;hiving off&quot;.     They range from the work of theRoyal Mint and air traffic control to parts of the social services,fie have not been able to make the detailed study which would be needed to identify particular cases;    but we see no reason tobelieve that the dividing line between activities for which Ministersa&quot;e directly responsible,and those for which they are not, is: ecsssariiy drawn in the right place today.     The creation ofurther autonomous bodies, and the drawing of the line between themand central government, would raise parliamentary and constitutional

There are a number of commercial enterprises withintne public sector   that are already run on this principle,    and itis also shortly to be applied to part of the Civil Service by&quot;hiving off&quot; the Post Office.      There are also non-commercialactivities in the public sector   that are similarly organised, forexample, the Atomic Energy Authority.159,   We have seen such a system operating in Sweden where theprinciple of &quot;hiving off&quot; is much more widely applied than has so far been attempted here.

The creation offurther autonomous bodies, and the drawing of the line between themand central government, would raise parliamentary and constitutional
( issues, especially if they affected the answer-ability forsensitive matters such as the social and education services.      these issues and the related questions of machinery of government arebeyond our terms of reference.     We think however that thepossibility of a considerable extension of &quot;hiving off&quot; should be examined, and we therefore recommend an early and thorough reviewof the whole question.]qi0   Meanwhile, we believe that the other recommendations in this chapter should make it possible to gain some of the benefits that could arise from &quot;hiving off&quot;, even where activities and servicesremain the direct responsibility of Ministers, by making it possibleto allocate responsibility and authority more clearly.     In thisconnection, we attach particular importance to our proposals:-(a) to distinguish those within departments whose primary responsibility is planning for the future,from those whose main concern is the operation of existing policies orthe provision of services;(b) to establish in departments forms of organisation and principles of accountable management,by whichindividuals and branches can be held responsible forobjectively measured performance.
CHAPTER 6THE STRUCTURE OF THE CIVIL SERVICE49. m      have recommended a number of far-reactiing changes in the wayI 42. -c-he Civil service is run.    We have reached the conclusion that forIthese changes to he fully effective, there must also he a fundamentalcnange in the structure of the Service.   Civil servants are atPresent organised in a large numher of separate classes, almost allf^lth their own different grading and career structures.    This  is anajor obstacle to the application of the principle we have set outin Chapter 1.   We recommend that classes as such should he abolished.In our view, all civil servants should he organised in a singletrading structure in which there are an appropriate numher of-different pay-levels matching different levels of skill and responsibility, and the correct grading for each post is  determinedby an analysis of the job.193. The change we are recommending will have massive repercussions on all aspects of Civil Service work and on the way it is organised.,&apos;i&apos;e believe it to he necessary, because the present structure of theService stands in the way of what we consider to be the onlyefficient method of matching men to jobs - rigorously examining whateach post demands before selecting the individual who is best fitted to fill it.   The structure we recommend will improve the opportunities of civil servants fully to develop their talents and to&apos; get theexperience they need for jobs of higher responsibility.    It willprovide a sound foundation for the application of the principles ofaccountable management, and hence for the efficient working ofgovernment departments.    It will mean that the organisation of a block of work can be determined by the best way of doing the jobrather than by the need to observe the traditional hierarchy ofparticular classes.    Since it will enable success in achieving setobjectives to become the determining factor in promotion, it will bea powerful stimulus to civil servants at all levels.    Finally,  the0Pening-up of opportunities, which it will offer to all civilservants, will, we believe, provide the constant competitive challengeneeded, for the achievement of maximum efficiency.
1911. We develop all these points later in this chapter.    We also give a fuller description of the new structure we recommend,pirst, however, we deal with the existing organisation and itsdefects; we survey it against the objectives which, in our view, the structure should seek to achieve.jm^ORJ^GTIVES195, The Civil service must have a clearly articulated and relatively formal structure; jobs must be graded in distinct bandswhich determine the pay of their occupants on a rational and fairbasis; and relative positions of authority and subordination must be clearly established.196. The problems of structure would in some ways be much simplerif each department employed its own staff independently, andconstructed its own grading system to fit the precise needs of itsown work and staff.   But the Civil Service cannot be run in this way.Departments have to work closely together in the achievement of commongoals; the boundaries between them are subject to constant revision;the complex interlinking of departmental tasks requires a commonapproach and methods of work; it is necessary for the effectivedischarge of the tasks of the Service that staff should be able tomove easily between departments - though, as we have stressed, mostlybetween related kinds of work.    To meet these needs, the Servicemust he a flexible, integrated whole;  it must continue to be a unified service.   Its structure should be designed accordinglyas a structure that   is common throughout.    Within such a structuretwo objectives are of overriding importance.197. The first is that the structure should enable all civilservants, whatever their background, skill or discipline, to make their full contribution to the work of government; in particular,scientific and other specialist staff should be able to bring theirProfessional training and outlook to bear effectively upon today * s major problems of policy-making and management.   This means an0Pen road to the top of the Service for all kinds of talent.    It alsomeans that suitable specialists must be able to take part in policy-making
and management at the lower and middle levels of the SEvice; quite apart from the valuable contributions they can make to managementit these levels, it is unrealistic to expect specialists to reachtop managerial positions without this earlier experience.198. The second objective is that the structure should promote the effective management of the work, and especially the organisationof mixed teams in the growing areas of work in which solutions to problems need the partnership of different skills and disciplines.Effective management calls for clear allocation of responsibility andchains of command designed to meet the needs of the particular jobin hand.   It also requires a structure flexible enough to accommodatefuture changes in the work and in the combinations of skills neededfrom time to t ime .TriE PRESENT STRUCTURE199, The present structure is still fundamentally the product of theNorthcote-Trevelyan report.   One of its basic principles was that a proper division of labour depended on the clear separation ofintellectual from routine work,and on the separate recruitment and deployment of staff for each.   Recruitment was directly linked to theoutput of the educational system; graduates were recruited for theintellectual work and non-graduates for the rest.    This principlehas been endorsed as regards initial recruitment by the recommendationsof subsequent Royal Commissions and Committees of Inquiry, and supported in the past by the Treasury in its responsibilities forthe overall management of the Service (though it has been temperedby a measure of class-to-class promotion after entry).    Hence the division of the Service into upper and lower classes in the samebroad areas of work.   The Administrative, Executive and ClericalGlasses are an example of these divisions ; direct recruitment to eachis in the main linked to the educational system - graduates at 22 or23 going mainly into the Administrative, school-leavers with &quot;A levels&quot;into the Executive and school-leavers with &quot;0 levels&quot; into the clerical Classes.200. over the years, as the government has taken on new tasks,it has been necessary to recruit large numbers of specialists -
I -     252Scientists, engineers, architects and others.    They have teen organisedSeparately in their own occupational groups; in the terminology ofthe Service, the separate grading structures which resulted are alsocalled classes.   Within the largest of these occupational /groups,further divisions have heen drawn between higher and lower classes,por example, there are three scientific classes - the scientificOfficer Class, the Experimental Officer Class and the ScientificAssistant Class - which broadly correspond to the Administrative,Executive and Clerical Classes.    Similarly the Works Group of professional Classes is supported by separate and parallel classescomprising technical officers and draughtsmen.201. The classes so far mentioned,  together with others such as theLegal, Medical and Accountant Classes, are ^general service&quot; classes.That is to say, their members are employed in all or in a substantial number of departments , each class with its own separate gradingstructure and scale of pay.    They have been created over a long period of time as a means of unifying the Service .   A hundred yearsago, each department was largely independent in recruiting andmanaging its staff.   The object of general service classes was topromote common standards and a sense of unity among all those wioaid similar work in different departments; it was also to enablestaff to be moved between similar jobs in different departments.The Administrative, Executive and Clerical Classes were the first ofthese general service classes; the scientific classes weresetup in the 1930&apos;s; the Works Group of Professional Classes afterthe Second World War.    The most recent addition was the general service Economist Class in 1965.^02. In addition to the general service classes there is a   great number of departmental classes; ranging in size from the veryar&quot;ge (e.g. the 20,000 or more in the Tax Inspector and Tax Officerlasses in the Inland Revenue) to those comprising only handfuls ofs&apos;-aff, whose members are employed in one department only.Departmental classes account for 12k,000, or some 27% of all non-indus-tfial civil servants.
203  As a result there are today k7 general service and similariasses whose members are distributed across  the service as a wholeland ov-er l,huO departmental classes whose members vo rk in one department only.   Each civil servant is recruited on entry to aoarticular class, depending upon the kind of work he applies for anahis educational qualifications for it.    His membersnip of his classdetermines his prospects, since most classes have their own differentgrading structures, reflecting responsibility and pay.    It largelydetermines, too, the range of jobs on which he may be employed:  thereare conventions governing the allocations of types of work to each class, some of which are buttressed by agreements with staff associations.   Although there is provision for individuals subsequently to move from one class to another, the processes are formal and restrictive.   Thus, in practice, whether they move between departments or, as is more usual, remain in one department, civil servants do notiramally think in terms of a career in the Service - they have a career in a class.20U. It is an important feature of the system that there are separatepay scales for each class.   These are determined for each class inaccordance with the principles established by the Priestley Commiss action of  1955.   The primary principle is that of !,fair comparison with thecurrent remuneration of outside staff employed on broadly comparablework&quot;.   Internal relativities are used as a supplement to theprinciple of fair comparison in settling Civil Service rates indetail, and they become the primary consideration when outsidecomparisons cannot be made.205 . It is also an important feature of the system that the policy-making and general managerial jobs in the Service are generallyreserved for members of the Administrative and Executive Classes.Specialists who seek broader managerial responsibilities normally haveto transfer to one or other of these classes.BCTSJff THE PRESENT STRUCTURE206. The basis of the divisions between higher and lower classes18 no longer valid.   The work of the Service cannot now be broken down for the purposes of recruitment into two simple categories, the
intellectual and the routine, the one appropriate for graduates andthe other for the rest.    The changing tasks of civil servants refuseto conform to this outmoded division, and the Service can dischargeits modern responsibilities only by drawing on many different kinds of ability at every level.    Higher-level posts still call for the ability to give advice to Ministers on complex policy issues.   but many now also require the ability to run large projects and programmes, and to manage large numhers of staff.    The practical,managerial qualities thus required at these levels are not necesssarilyidentified by success in a written degree examination taken manyyears before or, indeed, by any selection method for testing young people in their late &quot;teens or early t wenties.207. In the middle ranges, too, there are already jobs for graduates -for example, in the Executive and Experimental Officer classes.    Thiswill certainly continue and the numbers may grow.    But it makes no sense to maintain a class distinction between two groups of people that  has now to be based on the often narrow difference between onedegree and another - between an upper second and a lower or between a second and a third.    It is also difficult to maintain the presentsub-division of clerical work into two separate classes, with four or five passes at &quot;0 level* required for the Clerical Officer Glassand two or three for the Clerical Assistant Glass.      In addition, asthe report of our Management Consultancy Group shows, there is oftenno discernible difference in content between work done at the lower levels of one class and the upper levels of the one beneath it.&apos;i&apos;e have also to recognise the importance of the man whose promise islatent at the start of his career, hut who then proves his worth byhis performance.   The present structure increases the risk that histalent will remain undiscovered.208. The occupational divisions between separate disciplines andspecialisms are also under strain.    They are not at presentinstructed on any uniform principle.   Thus physicists and biologistsare Stuped in one class, while doctors have a separate class of their0wn, as do psychologists.   Secondly not all members of the same
o jr R*Z J Ddiscipline or occupation are classed, together.   For example&quot;, &quot;someelectrical and mechanical engineers engaged on research are in the scientific Officer Glass, while others, engaged on construction, arein the Works Group of Professional Glasses; hut the works Group also contains some who are engaged q.n research.   Similarly, there is no clear-cut occupational difference between the work done by membersof different classes; for example, it is frequently difficult to distinguish between the tasks given to the following members of three classes - Technical Officer Grade II (Technical Works, engineering and Allied Glasses), Assistant Experimental Officer (ExperimentalOfficer Glass) and Senior Scientific Assistant (Scientific OfficerClass ).209. This structure, as operated today, presents serious obstacles to the most flexible use of staff: -(a) It prevents the best deployment and use of individualtalent.   The formal and relatively rigid procedures involvedin moving from one class to another place unnecessarybarriers in the way of the movement of individuals, bothupwards to posts of higher responsibility and. sidewaysbetween different kinds of related work.    It also impedes the rapid development and promotion of young people withoutstanding potential.(b) It is a major obstacle to the ability of the Service to adapt itself to new tasks.   Bach class tends to regard the posts that    its members usually fill as its own preserve,guaranteeing a career structure with a fixed number of postsat various levels.   Men and women enter these classes intheir youth and form expectations about their prospects,to which they cling with increasing tenacity as the years goby.   Staff associations naturally tend to serve as theguardians of these territories, and to resist any proposal that seems likely to reduce the number of posts to which they feel their members have a right.   This rigidity in the deployment of staff is particularly serious at a time whenthe tasks are changing rapidly and new techniques are being
developed to meet them.    For example, as we point out- inAppendix D,  accountants could make a useful contributionto financial forecasting and control, procurement and Q andM. work; they are not in a position to do so because these duties are the province of other classes.(c) The career opportunities that    are thus defined for thedifferent classes vary greatly in their attractivenessand scope, even for people with similar educationalqualifications.    For example direct graduate entrants to boththe Administrative and Scientific Officer Glassesneed a first or second-class degree.    But Li6% of the posts in the Administrative Class carry salaries in excess of 3,500 a year, compared with 23.5l/o of the posts in the scientific Officer Class.   The point of this criticism isnot that these proportions should necessarily be equal; thework may not demand a higher proportion of purely scientificposts at middle and high levels,    It is that separateclassification at these levels encourages the idea thatopportunity is not equal - an idea that is justified to theextent that scientists cannot move easily into appropriatemiddle and higher management posts except through the relatively rigid process involved in moving from one classto another.(d) The word &quot;class&quot;, and the structure it represents,produce   feelings of inferiority as well as of restrictedopportunities.   This is most marked in the attitude of other classes towards the Administrative Class, but it can be seen in greater or lesser degree between lower and higher classesgenerally.210. The structure also leads to the inefficient organisation of work.It does so in three ways: -(a) Each class has its prescribed functions.   For example,financial and policy work are generally reserved to theAdministrative Class with appropriate support from the
-    257Executive Glass, while technical or scientific work belongsto the specialist classes.    Where administrators andspecialists are engaged in a common task, parallel or jointhierarchies are the usual devices to enable them to work together.    But within these hierarchies the administratoris normally responsible to another administrator in the nexthigher grade, and the specialist similarly to anotherspecialist; thus the separation of prescribed responsibilitiesis maintained.    These forms of organisation, wnich are a major source of inefficiency and frustration, are discussed in Chapter 5; but their roots lie in the structure of theService.(b) The separation of functions has a particularly damagingeffect in blurring responsibility and authority in command.There are many joint tasks, especially projects and programmes with a high technical content, in which goodmanagement depends upon putting a single person in charge and holding him responsible for the result; the rest of the teamshould be responsible to him.    Often, however , the separation of functions results in twin heads being in charge,one a specialist, the other an administrator.(c) A man&apos;s career is primarily thought of as a career within his class.    There is therefore a natural pressure tomaximise the opportunities of the class, in each area ofwork that it occupies, by making use of as many of itsgrades as possible.    The presumption thus grows up thatthe organisation of any area of work should reflect in full the grading structure of the class concerned - e.g. that the assistant Secretary is always needed between the Principaland the Under Secretary, and the Executive Officer betweenthe Clerical Ufficer and the Higher Executive Officer.   Thisis also true of the specialist classes.    The convention can be , and is, broken from time to time, but not enough.    the structure makes it more difficult to do so, and to introduceexperiments in the organisation of the work.
211. Underlying many of these criticisms is the fundamental point to which we drew attention in paragraph 193: that the system ofclasses stands in the way of the most efficient method of matching mento jots.   This is because classes are too crude an instrument forthe purpose.       They involve two assumptions:  that any job can becategorised as appropriate to one or other of the classes ; and thatit will then be most appropriately filled by selection from the membersof that class, all of whom are in principle more likely to be goodcandidates for it than any member of another class.    These assumptionsseem to us no longer sound, particularly in view of the work theCivil service now has to do.212. There are many jobs that can be filled only by qualifieddoctors or engineers: and many that will require the training and experience of the economic or social administrators discussed in chapter 2.:   But a growing proportion of jobs in the Service requireboth technical   and managerial knowledge and ability, and cannot now he properly classified as either technical (and therefore reservedfor the appropriate specialist class), or managerial (and thereforenormally reserved for the Administrative or Executive Class).    Thesejobs are to be found not only in the highest reaches of the Service;they exist at much more modest levels from about  1,500 a year upwards,especially in the big technological departments.   Taking the service as a whole, tkey may be a relatively small proportion at present.   Butas the work of the Service continues to change, and as new specialismsemerge, they are certain to multiply.    Thus, the categorisation of jobs by class becomes less appropriate year by year: and, when it comes to selection for posts, there is a steadily increasing area ofwork in which the implied assumption that the best man for the job willbe found within a given class has clearly become invalid.    In ourjudgement, therefore, a principle of organisation that rests upon this assumption and relies mainly upon formal procedures for inter-classsfers in order to provide for exceptions is no longer satisfactorywill, if it is not changed, become an increasingly seriousI obstacle to the proper deployment of talent.
z o y213. Finally, the present system of classes is a major obstacle totheproper application of the principles of accountable managementf which we recommend in Chapter 5.    This is because in analysing jobsthe Service now concentrates its attention and thought on the duties and tasks appropriate to particular classes and the various levelsv/ithin them.    In contrast, accountable management requires that themain weight should be placed upon an analysis of the results required from   each individual job, their relative importance to the work ofthe Service as a whole, and the consequent search for the man v/ith theright qualities and qualifications to produce those results; in this context? the practice of assigning duties to individuals by referenceto their membership of particular classes is at best an irrelevantdistraction and at worst a serious obstacle to the kind of job evaluation&apos; that is needed.THE NEW STRUCTURE WE PROPOSE21U. The structure the Service needs should in our view be based onthe following principles:  -(a) Both the grading of a post and the selection of the man to fill it should be based first and foremost on an evaluationof the job.(b) Management should appoint to each post the person it considers best fitted by his qualifications and experience to fill it.(c) No posts should be the preserve of any group, except in sofar as the individuals comprising the group may be uniquelyqualified for them, e.g. doctors for medical posts.(d) Since the qualifications and experience required for particular posts will vary from time to time, it should bethe right and duty of management to determine the newqualifications and experience required for them.(e) In filling individual posts, management should promote theright man even if he is not the next in the order ofseniority, or bring him in from outside the service if he cannot be found within it or if it believes that an appointment from outside would bring a valuable reinforcement of skill and experience.
(f) The pay for posts should continue to reflect the rate forthe 30b on the basis of fair comparison with market rates forjobs of comparable responsibility and authority outside theService.(g) The structure should permit work to be organised in such away that chains of command reflect the demands of the task and, where necessary, cut across any groupings by disciplineor type of skill.The application of these principles demands two fundamental andcomplementary changes in the structure of the Service.   Together theyproduce the single, unified grading-system running across the wholeService that - we referred to in paragraph 192.    For the sake ofclarity,, however, we present them separately at this stage.215. First, we recommend that the divisions between higher and lowerclasses should be abolished, and that a continuous grading-systemfrom bottom to top should be substituted in each occupational group.Thus, for example, we propose the merger of the Administrative,Executive, and Clerical Classes, as recommended to us by the Treasury.But we also propose mergers of the Scientific Officer , ExperimentalOfficer and Scientific Assistant Classes and of the Works Group of professional Classes, the Technical Works, Engineering and AlliedGlasses and the Architectural and Engineering Draughtsman Classes.Movement upwards, e.g. from clerical to executive or from experimentalto scientific work, should be by promotion from a lower to a highergrade; and this should lie within the direct authority of themanagement of each department, subject to appropriate centralsupervision of s tandards and numbers.   We also consider that thesupporting grades (e.g. messengers, typists, machine operators) shouldbe brought into this structure.   We discuss this further in Appendix J.216. Although this reform will bring the Civil Service into line withother large organisations in this, country, where divisions intonigher and lower classes are rare, it will present a radical changefQr the Service itself.    It is not simply a question of linkingtogether classes that now operate at completely separate levels of
pay and responsibility.   There is a good deal of overlap at presentbetween the levels at which these various classes operate and the types of work they do.    Thus, to replace the present class structureby a continuous grading structure from bottom to top for eachoccupational group will involve a major programme of job evaluation:a fresh examination of what each job or kind of job is for, and of the qualifications and experience it requires.217. Secondly, we believe that the principle of the best man for the job should apply between civil servants of different occupations no less than between those who enter the Service with different levels of educational qualification.   No posts should be the preserve of any: pv-&apos;   &apos;p,p..; p:&apos;::&apos;&apos;&apos;.. p&apos;&quot;&apos;P.:; &apos; I ; &apos;.pp-&quot;-.\p: p :&apos; sp  &quot;:&apos;       -p.: v :&apos;&apos; p p&quot; ::; - &apos;:y-p vp &quot;&apos;: v;..pone groug except in so far as individuals in the group may be uniquelyqualified for them.   This calls for another radical structural change.It means bringing to an end the system in which an individual cannormally move between jobs now reserved to different occupationalgroups only if he himself moves into a different class.218. To give full effect to our proposals at paragraphs 215 and 217,we believe that it is necessary to replace the present multitude ofclasses and their separate career structures by the creation of aclassless, uniformly graded structure of the type that is now being adopted in many large business firms and similar to the system used by the Civil Service in the United States.   The basis of the systemwe are proposing is the establishment of a number of successive gradinglevels that   together would embrace all the jobs in the Service.Kach grade would carry a range of pay.   The number of grades requiredcan be determined only after a more detailed analysis of the existingstructure than we have been able to make; but on the basis of theadvice we have received, we think that some twenty grades could containall the jobs from top to bottom in the non-industrial part of theIService.219. An essential feature of the system is that the salary range (orscale) for each grade should be relatively broad, and that there shouldbe overlapping of salaries between grades (see as an example the salary grading structure of the United States civil service shown -ia.
-.. 262jippendix C).   This is to provide scope for advancement within grades.Thus, while the most able will he promoted well before they r each themaximum of their grade, others can continue to earn salary increaseswithin the same grade.22O. All the jobs now performed by the many different classes shouldbe fitted into the appropriate grade.      This will require careful job evaluation.    This should be based on such factors as the &quot;end-results&quot;required, the degree of personal responsibility involved, theimportance attaching to the work and the qualifications and experienceneeded in the holder to achieve the prescribed results.   At the sametime, the process of job evaluation should take into account the marketrate for jobs of similar responsibilities outside the Service.    Thesystem is equally applicable to all types of job.    A scientific jobin a research establishment, high-level case-work in an administrativedivision, an engineering job, and a line-management job in an executive - clerical establishment can all be analysed and rankedwithin the same grading-system.221. This is essentially a pay structure;  it is not designed todetermine the actual organisation of work.   The precise organisation ofeach block of work, and the number of working levels in it, shouldbe determined solely by what is required for the most efficientachievement of its objectives.    Thus, in any division, job evaluationwould show that only a selection of the twenty or so grades should beused - the smallest number needed.    There should be no set pattern.222. Within this overall structure, there will, of course, continue tobe a great variety of groups of staff.   At the highest levels of theService, we think it useful to distinguish the top management,comprising all posts in all grades from the Head of the Civil Servicedown to, and including, grades that are today equivalent to UnderSecretary; we refer to this here and elsewhere in our report as the senior Policy and Management Group.   Although the work of thesegrades is not sharply different from those immediately below,nevertheless the higher one goes in the Service, the more one &apos; s work is
likely to consist of policy-making and higher management rather thanthe exclusive practice of a particular skill or discipline.   As a civil servant approaches these levels, his responsibilities becomesteadily heavier and usually less specialist.    He begins to share in a real collegiate responsibility to the Minister for the policy and management of the department as a whole;  increasingingly, too, he hasto take interdepartmental considerations into account.   At these levels an individual^ particular occupational group is thus oftenof less significance than his range of experience, and personalqualities and qualifications should be the main criteria    for fillingposts with, these wider horizons.   There comes a point, therefore,where promotions become &apos;. matteis affecting the interests of theService as a whole, and the Civil Service Department should play apart in them.   We distinguish the Senior Policy and Management group in order to define the area to which this should apply.223. Below this level, the occupational content of the work is oftengreater than the managerial content.   Thus occupational groupings ofstaff have a greater significance.   They vary greatly in kind.    TheMajority of civil servants are employed in supporting grades (seeAppendix j), where the work has little or no managerial content andits occupational content consists more of the practice of a skill(e.g. typing, filing or operating machines) than the application ofa discipline.   At higher levels,  the development and application ofa particular discipline, and the need for specialisation by subject-matter, beeomei  much more important, and in many parts of the work itsmanagerial content steadily increases as a man rises towards the senior levels referred to above.   At all levels however where the workrequires civil servants to specialise (whether in administrative,specialist or the various kinds of supporting work), occupationalgroups will be needed,and civil servants should generally be recruitedJaiW. trained as members of them.   They should include the presentspecialist disciplines, the two groups of administrative staffI identified in Chapter 2 and the supporting grades discussed inAPPendix J.
22k. At least during the earlier years of their career, most civilservants should work in the field of their specialism.   Those whose main inclinations and aptitudes lie in this direction could spendtheir whole careers in their specialised field, and we recognisethat many people will wish to do this.    Others, however, should progressafter appropriate training and experience to work that    becomessteadily more managerial in character in areas adjacent to theirspecialism; and posts at all levels which offer      the right kind of experience in management should be open to members of all occupationalgroups who are 1 fitted for them.    In a system of this kind civilservants could be given a clear indication of their career prospectsif they remain..    in their specialised field - the extent and shape of the structure of higher posts open to them if theydevelop in this direction.    We attach high importance to a structure in which people are able to take part in the development of their owncareer patterns.225. It is likely that occupational groups will t end to develop their own career patterns.   Men and women will enter the Service at different grades, (Spending upon the level of the work they have been recruited to do.   Thereafter, it   may . become usual for members ofparticular occupational groups to skip certain grades.    This shouldbe kept flexible; but it should be established that it is normalto skip grades on promotion, and thus that the field of candidates forpromotion is not limited to the grade immediately below.PAY IN THE UNIFIED GRADING STRUCTURE226. Though we have not examined in any detail the pay of the CivilService, we feel bound to make one comment on the implications forPay of the structure we propose.     The proposal does not in our viewimply a departure from the principle of &quot;fair comparison with thecurrent remuneration of outside staffs employed on broadly comparablework&quot; which was established by the Royal Commission on the CivilService 1953-1955.   In our view this principle remains valid andW1U continue to be necessary to the efficiency as well as to thecontentment of the Service .   But if our recommendations for a unified
grading structure are accepted, we should expect the outside comparison(fo be made as part of the process of job evaluation: assessing theimportance of the nob to the work of the Service and establishing therate for jobs of similar responsibility outside the Service.227. We recognise that the Civil Service attaches great value to negotiation and arbitration in the settling of pay claims.    these should he preserved.    It will be necessary to ensure that the systemwe propose does not result in the extension of formal negotiation and arbitration, to cover those questions,  such as the grading of individualjots, that should remain a matter for management to determine.    Butthe general pay-scales of the grades, and claims for higher pay on thebasis of comparisons with pay outside the Service, should continue tobe dealt with by negotiation and arbitration, adapted as necessaryto fit the new structunal pattern we propose.228. We have said in paragraph 218 that each grade should carry a range of pay.   This,in our view, should be true of all grades except the very top one - which should be a flat rate varied only in thecase of the Head of the Civil service (see Chapter 7, paragraph 258) -and possibly the grade immediately below.*229. In- all except the top grade, we think it important that there should be more flexible progression through the pay-scale of the grade.   Fixed annual increments, in our view, do not give enoughincentive to effort, and make possible too easy a progress for thoseISir William Cook, Sir Norman Kipping and Sir John -flail make thefollowing reservation on paragraph 228: -We see no reason why the principles of job evaluation and outsidecomparison should not extend to the most senior posts in theCivil Service.   This applies both to the level and to the rangeQf pay.   Some Permanent Secretaries carry responsibilitiescomparable to those of the chairmen of the great nationalised undertakings, who command much higher salaries: others are inposts which, though demanding, are less onerous.   We believethat these differences should be reflected in their pay.    We donot think it wise to make a man who has perhaps been appointedto a top post at i+8 or 50 feel that he has reached his ceilingat that age.   Unless there is still something for him to look forward to, the temptation for him to leave must be great.We think that even the highest posts should therefore be paid ona salary band. v
ffho do not pull their full weight.   We believe that it should be-possible to reward merit by e xtra pay as well as by promotion.    Thus,up to the level of the Senior Policy and Management Group, we recommendthat, while annual increments should continue, there should be thefollowing modifications : -(a) Additional increments should be granted both for especiallygood work and for success in gaining relevant qualifications.(b) Increments should be withheld when they have not beenearned.Above this level, regular annual increments seem to us unsuitableand the numbers are small enough to make a different system practicableThe range of pay for each grade should in effect become a &quot;band &quot; of pay, in which only the maximum and minimum points for each gradewould be published, and the progress of each officer through theband would not be on a regular incremental basis but determined by anannual review of his performance.    Individual salaries would notbe published.ADVANTAGES OP Km$n$$fr UNIFIED GRADING STRUCTURE230. We think that the structure we propose would have five mainadvantages.   First, we believe that the system will remove the obstacles to the flexible deployment of s taff to which we referred inparagraph 209.    It will thus offer wider opportunities to all civilservants.231. In particular, the unified grading-system we propose will enablethe Service to gain the full contribution which scientists, engineers and other specialist staff could, but do not now, make to policy,management and administration.    At present all these people havecareers in their own separate classes.    To move into more general management, they have to transfer to the Administrative and ExecutiveGlasses.   A few make the first move; practically none the second(although the Executive Class occupies managerial positions in theService up to a salary level of  5,250).   For specialists, the difficult problem arises of deciding whether they are likely to do better by transferring in mid-career to a new class which fills most
It-..     267of the top managerial and policy jobs; or by continuing to move&quot; upthe ladder of their existing class, with its narrower range ofp^o8t8, which does not generally take a man to the highest levels in the Service:.    The decision to seek a transfer also involves atleast the appearance of a formal severance from a man&apos;s originaldiscipline - a dividing-line which has to be crossed again if he wishes to return.    With the abolition of classes, such problems and difficulties should be significantly lightened.232.   This does not apply only to the higher levels of the Service.It is equally, if not more, important lower down.    The presentsystem makes it particularly and unnecessarily difficult forspecialists to be tested and given experience in general managementsufficiently early in their careers.    There are many members of the specialist classes at present in grades carrying between  1,500 and 2,500 a year, e.g. accountants, engineers, scientists, ExperimentalOfficers, Technical Grades A and B, who should be getting some experience of management in areas where their specialist knowledgewould he valuable.    This is not only because it would fit them for higher management later on; it would also enable them to make a useful contribution to middle and junior management here and now.233 .   A unified grading structure will also provide a more flexiblecareer pattern for administrative staff, by enabling the Service to deploy them to the best advantage without the need for transferringfrom the Executive Class to the Administrative Class or vice-versa.Here again difficult decisions now confront the most able members of theExecutive Class.    Their areas of work are often similar to those ofthe Administrative Class.    The able Executive who stays in his classhas good prospects of promotion to comparatively senior posts.    the top posts in the Service, however,  are open to him only if he seeks a transfer to the Administrative Class; but if he gets a transfer he mayln the end do less well tnan if he had remained a member of theExecutive Class since his chances of reaching senior posts in theAdministrative Class are relatively smaller.    Some play safe and stay;some of those who gain class-to-class promotion regret it.   At the same
time there is at present almost no movement from Administrative &quot;toexecutive Class jobs (which would look like demotion under thelisting system).    Thus, members of the Administrative Class arenot normally considered for the major management jobs that are reservedfor the Executive Class, although some may well have the aptitudefor them.   The structure we propose will allow completely flexibleposting to suit the aptitudes of administrators as they develop inthe course of their careers.23h. A unified grading structure will thus offer wider opportunities to all civil servants.    This is not, of course, to say that it willoffer better prospects to all members of all the present classes.The widening of opportunities should lead to keener competition,and favour the most able civil servants regardless of their occupational group.    Our proposal is designed, among other things,to bring this about.235 . In addition to providing the framework for the more flexibledeployment of staff, we believe the second main advantage of a unified grading structure is that it would promote more efficient and accountable management and the more economical use of manpower.In Chapter 5 we define accountable management as a system in whichindividuals and units are held responsible for performance and output measured as objectively as possible, and we make more detailed proposals there about the departmental organisation needed for this,rte believe that a unified grading structure would of itself resultin a far more effective method of grading and manning jobs in theService and thus promote greater efficiency.    This is because: -(a) The detailed job-evaluation system needed to set it up andrun it will define and measure the &quot;end-result&quot; required ofeach post.   An individual^ performance can then be judgedagainst this specification and by his actual achievement.The present system of grading and evaluating jobs concentrateson assessing whether the duties are appropriate to aparticular level of a particular class, and not on the end-result of the job.
(b) With the disappearance of classes, the present pressures touse all possible grades in the organisation of a block ofJ work (to which we referred in paragraph 210) will also bereduced.    This is because members of different groups willhave more varied career opportunities than they have now.In a common grading structure of twenty or so grades,  therecan be no set pattern for their use; it will, therefore, benecessary to ensure, by analysis of the work itself, that only the right selection of grades and occupational groupsis used for each block of work.(c) Common grading will help to get rid of the separate andparallel hie; archies which we criticised as the wrong wayof applying a variety of skills and disciplines to a commontask.   The practice of allocating defined kinds of work to different classes will disappear with the classes themselves.In consequence, it will become easier to construct integratedhierarchies and teams that    embody different skills atappropriate levels under the single command of the officer incharge.(d) If grading is made to depend upon the rigorous analysis of individual jobs,  it will become an effective mechanism,built into the structure of the Service itself, for guardingagainst the inefficient use of manpower and the perpetuationof unnecessary jobs.    The process of job evaluation,properly applied, tests both the value of the job itself andthe levels of qualification it requires.    It should thereforebecome an effective safeguard against the mis-use of qualified manpower and should help to ensure thatunnecessary jobs are eliminated.236. We believe too that job evaluation in the context of a commongrading structure offers the only rational method of solving theProblems which now beset the classification and grading of the work0f the specialist classes to which we have referred in paragraph 208.
ZLjjg evidence makes clear* that the present frontiers between thefibntific Officer and vVorks Group Glasses in the engineering field,for example, are wholly unsatisfactory.   We are convinced that suchoroblems are inherent in class structures, and that, in this as inother fields, the selection of the r ight man for job (neither over-qualified nor under-qualified to fill it) must depend, not uponmembership of a class,but upon the continual re-evaluation of thepost and of the varying skills and levels of qualification itsay demand from time to time.237. Thirdly, a structure on these lines will make easier much-neededimprovements in the system of promotion which we have criticised in chapter 3.   At present a civil servant is normally promoted within his class to a higher post in the area of work reserved to it.Opportunities for promotion vary greatly between different classes and also within the same class between different departments:promotion is toe much determined by a man&apos;s seniority in his present grade in his class in a particular department.   Promotionboards cannot generally consider a man&apos;s fitness for promotion to a3ob outside the field of work allocated to his class, even thoughhis qualifications and experience might bring a useful contributionto it.   At the same time, promotions within a class are normallybased on the criterion that, in order to qualify, a man must be fitto do any of the jobs assigned to his class at the higher level.In our view, these factors together result in a system of promotionthat is insufficiently discriminating.   Too little attention is givento finding for those wno have achieved promotion,the precise jobsat the higher level for which they are best fitted; and some, whowould be very adequate performers in a limited range of jobs at thehigher level, fail to achieve the promotion they deserve.*  See the paper submitted by the Treasury, the Ministry of Publicouilding and Works and the Ministry of Technology on Scientists,engineers and the Works Group (Volume 5, no.7).
O &apos;7238. The unified grading structure we propose would provide the /necessary foundations for a new promotion system in which: --v   (a) Promotion is based on the record of an inaividual&apos;sachievement in producing the &apos;end-results 1 at which his jobis aimed.(b) The aptitudes and experience of the individual can bemore directly and specifically linked to the requirement of a particular job at the higher level.(c) Promotion boards -can consider candidates for higher posts, not only within the field of theirspecialisation, but also in management posts where theirspecialist knowledge may be useful.(d) Because performance is taken properly into account, andselection based upon the aptitudes and experience of theindividual rather than upon his membership of a particularclass, there are more nearly equal promotion opportunities for all.(e) Able individuals can skip grades.(f) In so far as seniority denotes valuable experience,it can begiven its proper weight: but that weight will not be excessive if the main emphasis in promotion questions is onthe assessment of individuals by results achieved and bytheir aptitudes, skills and relevant experience for particular jobs at higher levels.This reform of the grading structure should  enable the systemof promotion to be adapted to what we see as the main objective:I that a man&apos;s experience and qualification to do a particular kind ofI job at a higher level should be the main factor in promotion1 decisions; and that, in assessing this, full weight should be given1 to his performance in the job that he has been doing.    In order toI give full effect to this change, methods of reporting on staff willI need to be revised.   In particular, we recommend that report formsII should be re-cast in such a way as to oblige reporting officers ton .I give a much fuller assessment of performance (i.e. of success inI achieving definite objectives) than they normally give at present.
239. Fourthly, a common grading s trueture which extenas across thevole Service offers, in our view, the only practicable means ofdealing with the fragmentation of over IkOO departmental classes,each with its own separate pay and career structure.   There is general agreement that this situation ought not to be allowed tocontinue; the existence of this vast number of separate classesproduces unnecessary complexity in the work of management, not leastby multiplying the number of separate pay negotiations.    But our examination of the departmental classes has convinced us that so longas the Service maintains separate general service classes, there isno rational or logical basis on which the number of departmentalclasses can be significantly reduced.    The great bulk of them canplead for separate existence on the same grounds as those put forward by any of the main general service classes.    Within a unified gradingstructure however, the whole problem of the separate departmentalclasses can be dealt with; after the necessary job-evaluation procedurethey can be absorbed at the appropriate levels jntothe new structure.Many of them should continue to form distinct occupational groups,with their own recruitment, training and career management.    But their members, like those of the more general groups, would also beavailable for employment in jobs of middle and junior managementadjacent to the areas of their specialism.21$. Fifthly, we believe that a radical change in the structure of the Service is needed to give real effect to many of the other proposals we have made.   The operation of the present structure has bred overa long period of years attitudes and practices   that- are deeplyingrained.   Therefore we do not believe that it is sufficient toleave the structure basically as it is; incorporate in it somemodifications; and then expect the Service to operate it in afundamentally new way.    This is in essence what the Treasury have proposed.   They have recommended the merger of the Administrative,Executive and Clerical Classes and a form of open structure at the top of the service only; the remainder would continue in their
existing classes.   In our view this partial reform is inadequate.We intend no criticism of the future managers of the Service when     gay that, with the best intentions, they could not carry it through to success.   As long as a structure based on classes persists, theattitudes and practices associated with it will hinder the efforts of management to open up careers to all the talents and to make fully effective all the changes in organisation and practice we recommend.PRIORITIES IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MgmQWGRADING STRUCTURE241.   The introduction of the new system and its implementationthroughout the Service will be a major undertaking.    It will call forclose and detailed consultations with the Staff Side on such matters as the general shape of the new structure, methods of settling pay claims, methods of job evaluation and a review of the existingcriteria on which the annual report on the performance of each civil servant is based.242.   There will also have to be a substantial tr^ning programme for those who will carry out the necessary job evaluation.   the subsequent application of job-evaluation techniques onthe scalerequired to cover the whole Service will Inevitably be a detailed andlengthy process.   In this connection, however, it is important to stress that the total task may not be as massive as it might appear.Over wide areas of the Service, jobs can be grouped into &quot;families&quot;for grading purposes so that the numbers that have to be analysedin detail are only a proportion of the whole.   It will take alarge-scale operation to move the Service completely over to thenew structure we recommend; how large will depend upon the extentto which present gradSngs are right.2(*3.  Given acceptance in principle of our proposal for a unifiedgrading structure throughout theSService, we think that it may be helpful to indicate what we believe to be the first priority.   Wethink that the Civil Service Department should mount a major sftudy to&quot;ork out the details (including the number of grades and the systemof Job evaluation appropriate to the Service) of a scheme for awtfiefi grading structure, together with a time-scale for its
implementation.    Our consultations have led us to helieve that it1 ,ill take from three to five years to produce a detailed schemeand implement it throughout the Service.    In our view, the CivilService Department will need to draw heavily on outside management consultants at all stages in this process.
n7nCHAPTER 7THE CENTRAL MANAGEMENT OP THE CIVIL SERVICEAND RELATIONS WITH STAFF ASSOCIATIONS21(4.   The responsibilities of the Treasury at present cover &quot;bothfinancial and economic policy, including the control of public expenditure, and also the central management of the Civil Service.By &quot;management&quot; in this context we mean the task of directing orrunning   the Service itself - controlling its staffing and remuneration,its structure and organisation, and promoting efficient methods ofwork.   In this chapter we discuss the task of central management, itslocation and staffing, and its relations with other departments,l/e also deal with the relations between management, both central and departmental,,   and the organisations that   represent the staff.245.   The Treasury is divided into two parts to carry out its dualtask.   Its central management functions are discharged by the &quot;pay and Management&quot; group under a Joint Permanent Secretary who is designatedHead of the Civil Service,    This side of the Treasury also hasimportant central functions in relation to the pay and pensions ofother public services and bodies.    The &quot;Pay and Management &quot; group,however, has never been, and is not today, a ful^-d.eve loped directingbody at the centre with complete overall authority to manage theCivil Service.   We have discussed the divided responsibility for recruitment in Chapter 3.    The Treasury has the final responsibility and authority on questions of Civil Service pay (within overallconsiderations of incomes policy); on pensions; on the number ofstaff employed and the grading of posts (i.e   determining the level ofresponsibility demanded by the job), though it delegates certain powersto Departments from time to time - in some matters, such as grading,quite extensively.   The authority of the Treasury is less in Q9 and M*wrk, management services (i.e. the promotion of the best managementPractices), training and personnel management; in these, its role is mainly guiding and advisory.    In machinery of government questionswilere political considerations are often paramount, the Treasuryarises the Prime Minister.
2^6.   As would be expected, the Treasury has developed its functionsmost fully in those fields where it has full authority - like pay and numbers of staff.   Elsewhere, although its central managementrole has recently been extended, it has been patchy rather thansystematic, with too few staff and too little expertise.THETASK 0? CENTRAL MANAGEMENT247.   The proposals we are making for the Civil Service as a whole -the abolition of the present system of classes, a system of centralrecruitment more directly related to the needs of departments, thegreater professionalism of administrators and specialists, the better career management, training and deployment of staff, and the promotion of greater departmental efficiency - will all make greaterdemands than in the past on the central management of the Service.To make these proposals fully effective, the role of central management needs to be changed and enlarged.248.   The primary role of central management should be to ensurethat the Service is continuously governed by the principleoutlined in Chapter 1: that the Service should constantly reviewits tasks and the possible ways in which it might perform them; then.consider what new skills and kinds of men are needed and how these can be found, trained and deployed.- As we have said, this requires that recruitment, training and personnel management and organisation should be regarded as integral parts of a unified process: supplyingand developing the talent the Service needs and deploying it to thegreatest possible advantage.    Clearly this constant adaptation of men and methods to changing tasks must be a joint responsibility,shared between central management and individual departments, butcentral management must have the appropriate degree of iltimate authority in those questions that affect the interests of thepublic service as a whole.   We consider   that its main responsibilities,including those that are at present discharged by the &apos;!Pay and management group of the Treasury, should be:-(a) to stimulate and assist departments in reviewing the kinds of skill and forms of organisation needed fortheir tasks as they change and develop;
(b) ill the light of this review, to determine manpowerrequirements both in quantity and quality, agree with departments how these requirements should be met, providethe necessary common services for new recruitment and internal transfer and satisfy itself that departments are efficiently and economically staffed;(c) to specify in consultation with d epartments thequalities, qualifications and experience required ofnew recruits to the Service;,(d) to determine (after such negotiations as are necessary ineach case) pay, pensions and other conditions of service;(e) to determine training policy in consultation with departments, conduct central training courses, arrange-external training, and stimulate and guide trainingwithin departments;(f) to promote career development throughout the Service,and in particular to co-operate with and guide departments in fostering the promotion, and planning the futured development, of the most promising members of alldisciplines;(g) to promote mobility both between departments and betweenthe Service and outside employments;(h) to discuss with departments (which should be requiredto consult central management on this matter) allpromotions to the Senior Policy and Management Group,and to take the initiative in proposing individual movesbetween departments both within the group and at lower levels.
(i)   t&apos;o advise the Prime Minister on:-^ (i)    appointments at the salary-level of Deputy secretary and above; and(ii)   the most efficient division of responsibility between departments-r(j)   to study new developments in methods of organising work,in management techniques and in office machinery, and promote their use throughout the Service. - .m NEW CIVIL SERVICE DEPARTMENT249,   For these tasks of central management to be dischargedeffectively in the Civil Service of the future, two majorinstitutional changes are needed.250.   First, as we have recommended in Chapter 3, the responsibilityfor recruitment and selection at present carried by the Civil service commission should be brought together withine other functions of central management within a single organisation.251.   Secondly, the expanded and unified central management of theService should be made the responsibility of a new department createdspecifically for that purpose.     Our reasons for this are as follows.252.   The Treasury&apos;s concern for public expenditure led toits development as the central managerial authority for the Service   ;as a whole.     But the British Civil Service is now almost alone in continuing to combine these functions in a single department.     In ourview, the central management of the Service is not under, modern conditions.an appropriate function for the central finance department,for three reasons :-(a)   The role of the central management of the Service needs tobe enlarged.     In particular, if it is to discharge its fullresponsibilities for senior appointments (which meansensuring that men and women from   all disciplinesare considered for these appointments on the basis of their individual qualifications and experience), it must follow that central management will need to have much greater
knowledge than in the past of tile most able civil servants of alldisciplines, particularly those who are likely candidates for top posts,    and influence over their appointments.If this enlarged responsibility for career developmentwere added to the Treasury&apos;s responsibilities for financialand economic policy and for the control of public expenditure, there would be reason to fear too great a concentration of power in one department.     The overalldirection of the Service and the key to individualsuccess within it should not both lie with the department that . also uses the powerful weapon of central financial control.Each of the two sides of the Treasury needs to use anexpertise separate and different from that required by theother;    our proposals for increasing the professionalismof the Service will cause them to grow still furtherapart.     We do not, therefore, think that central management should be predominantly staffed, as it is todayat Assistant Secretary and Principal level, by those whose main training and experience have been in techniques ofgovernment finance and the control of expenditure.     Thepresent practice of manning both sides of the Treasury atthis level by a constant interchange between them impedesthe development of a full professionalism in each.     a proportion of the staff of central management should comefrom other departments on loan,   but the Treasury shouldnot be the predominant source of this flow.     It should come from all departments.Central management should be positively and creativelyconcerned with maintaining and improving the standards of the Civil Service.     It should therefore be aseparate institution with a single-minded devotion toits own professional purpose;   and should be in aposition to fight,    and to be seen fighting, theTreasury on behalf of the Service.
-    280253    In addition to these questions of principle, there is an--tant practical question of confidence.     There is today amongvivil servants a lack of confidence in the Treasury asimp oncithe centre of Civil Service management.      In our judgment, the Treasurynas contributed to this by employing too few staff on this work.A change is necessary for other sufficient reasons but also to demonstrate that a fresh start is being made.      If our proposals areto have a fair chance of success, there must be no doubt about the effectiveness of the central direction.     There will be no confidence that they will be implemented in the radical spirit we believe to benecessary, if central management is left where it is.254.   Accordingly we recommend as the first main step in the reform of the Service the setting up of a new Civil Service Department.This should absorb the functions of the Civil Service Commission and carry the responsibilities for central management outlined inparagraph 248*.255.   The staffing of this new d epartment will be of critical importance.     The full development of the responsibilities wehave described will call for men and women who have knowledge and experience of personnel management and organisation, both inside and outside the Service.     This will require a mixture of long-term and short-term appointments.     The new department should not in our view he predominantly staffed by officers who have spent most of theircareers in the Treasury, and can thus have a little experience of .direct responsibility for management.     Departments generally shouldhe prepared to release some of their best men for a period ofservice in the Civil Service Department, especially from among those with departmental experience of personnel and organisation work.We believe that the work of the new department will include some ofthe most challenging and creative jobs that the Service has to offer.*fc envisage in paragraph 266 below that this chang      JQ thethe consequence that-the new departme^ should  ^central functions in relation ti the Pay and Manage^ntservices and bodies that at present belong to Servicegroup of the Treasury.   If &quot;jljJi011 \\ ?fl however the mostDepartment&quot; may not be the right title. tconvenient term for the purposes of this
rye also consider it important that a number of appointments atsenior levels within the new department should be made from outsidef the Service of people with appropriate knowledge and experience of managing large organisations both at home and abroad.256.   The department should also include specialists (e.g. scientists and engineers) who will be able to bring an intimate knowledge and experience to bear on the recruitment, training and careermanagement of members of their own disciplines.    There should bean appropriate measure of central management for all the majoroccupational groups, and the members of each group should be ableto feel that their interests are being looked after at the centre.In some cases, e.g. the lawyers, it seems appropriate for a seniorpractitioner of the specialism in question (not necessarily fromthe Civil Service Department itself) to be designated head ofthe profession or group, and to share with the Civil service department the responsibility for guiding the main lines of itsmanagement policy.   Another helpful practice, already in use forsome groups, is a management committee on which senior practitionersof a particular specialism and representatives of the Civil service department sit together.   We see no reason why the patternshould not vary.   But the Civil Service Department should itselfcommand all the necessary information about the specialist groups and be so staffed as to be able to handle them with directknowledge and professional  (management expertise.257.   The new department should include a Planning Unit on the lineswe have discussed in Chapter 5.   Some members of the department should have the prime responsibility for considering new developmentsm personnel management, training and management techniques;through contacts with the world outside, both at home and abroad,they should keep the management of the Civil Service abreast of experience elsewhere; and through their own expertise make it aaodel of progress in its field for others to follow.
258.   We also recommend that the official head of the Civil Service&apos;* Department should be designated head of the Home Civil Service.We think that he should receive a sufficient lead in pay over theother official heads of departments in the Home Civil Service to mark his status.    At present the lead of the Joint permanent secretary of the Treasury (see paragraph 2h5) is  600 a year, and similar leads are held by three other top officials: the otherJoint Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, the Secretary tothe Cabinet and (outside the scope of our enquiry) the Head ofthe Diplomatic Service.   As far as the Home Civil Service isconcerned, the &quot;other leads are something of a historical accident:the three offices were at one time held by a single individual;he had a lead of  1,000 over other Permanent Secretaries; when the offices were separated, the lead was split.   We doubt if these other leads should be perpetuated; in our view it is hard tosubstantiate that the posts concerned carry greater responsibilitythan those of many other Permanent Secretaries.    At the same time,we are clear that the responsibilities we propose for the Headof the Civil Service are of a different kind.    We propose therefore that the other leads should be abolished when the present incumbentsleave their posts, and that all Permanent Secretaries should receivethe same rate of pay, with the exception of the Head of the home civil Service whose lead should be of the order of  1,000.*259.   The creation of a new Civil Service Department raises theimportant question of the relationship between the Head of the*The reservation which Sir William Cook, Sir Norman Kipping andpir John Wall have made on paragraph 228 (Chapter 6) also applieshsre.
&quot;civil Service and the Prime Minister.   Today the Prime minister has direct responsibility for senior appointments and for themachinery of government as well as for security in theCivil Service.   On these subjects the present arrangement is thatthe Head of the Civil Service reports direct to the Prime Ministerand not to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.   It is our strong hopethat similar arrangements will be maintained in the new department,with the Head of the Home Civil Service maintaining his presentresponsibility for these matters and reporting direct to thePrime Minister.260.   There should however be a change in the machinery for makingtop appointments.   At present the Head of the Civil Service makeshis recommendations to the Prime Minister after consultation with - -xthe Ministers and others directly concerned.   We have no reason to doubt that all the relevant views are taken into account.   We thinkhowever that this arrangement vests too much responsibility in a singleindividual and in a way that creates the impression that his recommendations to the Prime Minister are within his sole discretion.Many civil servants criticise this - we think rightly.    Infuture, we consider that in putting forward names to the Prime minister the Head of the Civil Service should be assisted by a committee.The committee should have a variable composition, depending on the appointments and candidates under consideration.    It should bedrawn from a panel.   The panel should have a rotating membership,appointment to it being for a term of, say, two or three years.Normally the committee would consist of two or threg permanent secretaries, an approximately equal number of scientists or other specialists
I -     284and not more than two eminent people from outside the Service.i Xhe &quot;outsiders&quot;   might have no personal knowledge of the candidates, hut their wide experience of business or other outsideactivity could in our view help to avoid an inbred and purelyCivil service attitude to these appointments.     The Head of theCivil Service, after consulting the Ministers concerned and thiscommittee, should put forward recommendations to the Prime Minister.&apos; we recommend that this procedure should cover all appointments atthe salary-level of Deputy Secretary and above.261,   Making the right arrangements for the ministerial controlof the new department will be decisive for its success.     Wetherefore feel bound to comment on this.     We have already expressed the hope that the Prime Minister will continue to be directly responsible for senior appointments? as for the machineryof government and security.     We are also,, however, strongly of theopinion that it is in the interests of the Service for thePrime Minister to be seen to be ultimately responsible, not justfor these specific questions, but also for the total task of managing the Service.     No other Minister can assert the needs ofthe government service as a whole over the sectional needs ofpowerful departmental   Ministers,     At the same time,  the PrimeMinister cannot himself be expected even at present to handle allthe day-to-day Civil Service problems : that - require ministerialattention.     still less will he be able to do so in the future ifthe central management of the Service becomes, as we propose,a much larger job than it is today.     The Prime Minister will therefore need ministerial support.     We do not believe that this responsibility should be allocated to a Minister who is also incharge of, and thus likely to be preoccupied by, the affairs ofQne of the other departments.     We hope that we are not exceeding our&apos;-erms of reference too much if we recommend that, outside the areai0r which he is directly responsible already, the Prime minister should delegate day-to-day responsibility to a non-departmental
Minister of appropriate seniority who is also a member of -theCabinet.   His part will be of vital importance, especially duringthe period of reorganisation.ABLATIONS BETWEEN THE CIVIL SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS262.   The Civil Service Department, charged with the management of theService but divorced from direct contact with its work, could tooeasily become remote.    We therefore attach great importance to theregular interchange of staff between the new department and otherdepartments proposed in paragraph 255.    This interchange should be mainly with the personnel and organisation branches of departments,but the Civil Service Department will also need those with direct and recent experience of ordinary work in departments.263.   The expanded role we recommend for the Civil service department in paragraph 2J+8 above should not be allowed to developinto a take-over by central management of responsibilities thatproperly belong to the other departments.    Our recommendationsinvolve an expansion of their responsibilities as veil, particularlyin recruitment, career development and the promotion of departmental efficiency.    The principle to be followed in allstaff and organisation matters should be to delegate to individual departments the maximum authority compatible with the requirementsof the Service as a whole.    We put forward -the following considerations to illustrate what we believe to be the right kindof balance between them:-(a) Departments should play a greater part than at present inrecruitment, both in the direct recruitment of specialiststaff and in stating their future requirements for thevarious kinds of staff who will continue to be recruitedcentrally (see Chapter 3).(b) In manning and grading, there should be the maximumdelegation of authority to departments that is practicable from time to time.   We do not wish to propose any change at present.   We think that the balance shouldbe carefully watched, especially in relation to specialist
posts, where less authority is at present delegatedthan for non-specialist posts.On questions of internal departmental efficiency and organisation, the role of central management naturallyvaries as between small departments which now rely upon theTreasury and the larger departments which have their own0.and M. teams.     We recommend in Chapter 5 thatthe branches of the larger departments responsible formanagement services should in f future have an enlarged rolewith more expert staff.      The main role of theCivil Service Department should be to encourage the useof the most modern techniques rather than itself to implement the changes that are needed, within departments .We think however that it may have a special part to play in assisting reorganisation at the higher levels of departments; and in the last analysis it shouldbe in a position both to call all departments to account for failure to use the recommended techniques, and to putin its own men to investigate any departmental organisationand to recommend improvements.In the management of staff, especially in the planning ofcareers, the main responsibility must remain with theemploying departments;    we have recommend in Chapter 3a considerable expansion of the part they play.     At thesame time we have argued that the Civil Service department will have to play a larger part than the Treasury doestoday and must have more ult imate authority.     although we recommend that civil servants, especially administrators,should move much less frequently between jobs in the samedepartment, the development of the specialisms to which;we have referred may make it desirable that there should bemore movement, of both administrators andspecialists, between   Apartments,     This
applies especially to those civil servants, of whateverdiscipline, who are identified as being capable offilling the highest posts.    The Civil Service department should be responsible for informing itself about them,should consult with the employing departments about their training and development and should take theinitiative in proposing appropriate moves for individuals in the longer-term interests of the work of the service as a whole.    In this way the total manpower of theService will be most effectively used and the fullestopportunities given to each individual for widening his experience and for timely promotion.   We think toothat the Civil Service Department must have a voice,especially during the early years of the new system, in deciding upon promotions to the Senior Policy and management Group; it will be important to make clearthat the whole of the field has been given proper^consideration and that every individual has had afair chance.   We recommend therefore that the CivilService Department should be represented on all thedepartmental boards (see Chapter 3) that considerpromotions to posts within the Senior Policy and management Group (but below the level to be covered by theservice-wide committee proposed in paragraph 260).   we expect that these moves and promotions would normally be agreed between the Civil Service Department and thedepartments concerned.    If differences of opinion arisethat   cannot be resolved otherwise, it would be for the&quot;Prime Minister to decide.RELATIONS WITH THE TREASURY264.   A separate Civil Service Department involves the co-existenceof two central departments, the new department and the Treasury,each of which in its own sphere will be a centre of co-ordination,provide central services and occupy a position of central control.
-    288It will &quot;be important to ensure that the functions of these twoI departments and- ^e relationship between them are clear anddistinct.265.   We believe that all the functions now exercised by the &quot;pay and Management&quot; group of the Treasury should be transferred tothe Civil Service Department.   This will include:(a) responsibility for advising the Prime Minister on themachinery of government;(b) general supervision of departmental organisation;(c) the development and dissemination of administrative and managerial techniques- in addition to the broad responsibility for the management of theCivil Service.266.   So far as the Civil Service is c oncerned, theprinciple on which the division should be based is that all thefunctions that&apos;- now belong to the Treasury in its role as &quot;employer&quot;should be transferred to the Civil Service Department, leaving to theTreasury responsibility for advising the Chancellor of the exchequer on the overall control and allocation of public expenditure, on financial and fiscal policy and on the general management of the economy.     Although this is strictly beyond our terms ofreference, we think that the application of this principle will also involve the transfer to the new department of the functions atpresent exercised by the &quot;Pay and Managemenif group of the Treasury inrelation to other public services, e.g. the Diplomatic Service, the armed Forces and other public servants such as teachers and nurses.287.   Over part of the field, this principle of division raises noproblems.     The Civil Service Department will clearly carry the wholeof the central responsibility for Civil Service staff matters,including recruitment, training, career management and retirement,and advice on top-level appointments.     Over other parts, however,,v&apos;ere the functions of central management have a direct effect uponpublic expenditure, it will be necessary to devise arrangements that \
give the new Department a real base of independent authority withoutimpairing the ultimate responsibility of the Treasury and theChancellor of the Exchequer for the control of public expenditurea3 a whole.   This means that the Treasury should retain its presentconcern for the total cost of particular services - costs which will include, in varying proportions, the cost of employing civil servants and other public servants.   The precise allocation of functions between the two departments will need to be worked out; it may be helpful to examine how this is done in other countries more fullythan we have been able to do.   But we think that it should broadlyfollow this pattern:-(a) Pay.The Treasury should retain a continuing interestin incomes policy as part of its responsibility for financial and economic management, but not in the staffcosts as such of     particular services. The CivilService Department should be solely responsible forapplying the government&apos;s incomes policy to the public services.    Within the normal rules of collective Cabinetresponsibility, this department should therefore have thefinal authority on any given pay settlement.    TheMinister who is to assist the Prime Minister in the running of the new department will thus be in a keyposition, both in relation to his Cabinet colleagues andin relation to all members of the public services.This reinforces our recommendation in paragraph 261 thathe should be a member of the Cabinet.(b) NumbersSimilarly, the central responsibility for ensuring that departments are efficiently and economically staffedshould rest solely with the Civil Service Department.Staff costs are a part, in some areas a predominantpar% of public expenditure, and would thusfall inevitably within the overall purview of theTreasury.   But it should be the task of the Civil service department, rather than of the Treasury, to determine the
-.  290scale of the staffs &apos; necessary for the efficientdischarge of the tasks of departments;   and the treasury should in all cases have to accept that a given taskdemands the staff that    the new department,: after examination,is satisfied are needed.    In practice, this wouldmean that departments proposing new policies would have tosatisfy the Civil Service Department about the implicalions oftheir proposals for the numbers of staff needed and theTreasury about their other costs.     The Treasury would look at the total costs of the proposed new policies;   but it should not question the staffingrequirements once these have been approved by the new department.      In forward surveys of public expenditure and in the annual estimates, each of the two central departments would conduct its own examination of the costsfalling within its own field.      If the Treasury took   theview that the total expenditure should be reduced, itwould be free to challenge the policies of the spending departments ?   but not the assessment of staffcosts approved by the Civil Service Department.  :More generally, given the need to make the most economical use of manpower, we think it most important that the forecasting of demands for manpower in the varioussectors of the economy should be considerably developed and improved.     It should be for the Civil service department to speak for the public services in this field,(c)   Organisation and management techniquesThe Treasury should retain responsibility for developing and disseminating techniques of financial analysisand systems of financial control, and this will give it an interest in certain aspects of departmental organisation as well as in interdepartmental procedures.     It should therefore discuss with the Civil Service Department such
changes in departmental organisation as it may think are needed for the improvement of financial control;   when these have been agreed, it should he for the Civil service department  to supervise  their implementation.268.   On the basis of these general principles, working proceduresshould be devised,&quot; between spending departments and the twocentral departments, and between the central departments themselves,so as to reduce administrative complications to the minimum.They should &quot;flexible.     In many cases it would nodoubt be desirable to set up joint teams for particular operations,e.g. for the examination of a spending programme or for are organisation of a part of the work in the interests of betterfinancial control.     But such arrangements should be based upon,and not allowed to blur, the clearest possible distinction betweenthe functions and responsibilities of each of the two centraldspartrnents.WHITLEY COUNCIL MACHINERY AND THE ROLE OP STAFF ASSOCIATIONS269.   Staff relations in the Civil Service are organised through the collective machinery of Whitley Councils.     The great majority ofcivil servants belong to staff associations which represent grades orclasses and are recognised as having the right to negotiate on their behalf.     The main associations are members of the Staff Side of theNational Whitley Council,  and the associations recognised in each department constitute the Staff bides of Departmental WhitleyCouncils.     The Official Side of the National Whitley Council normallycomprises a number of Permanent Secretaries and a few Treasury officers that of Departmental Whitley Councils comprises officers of thedepartment.270.   Whitleyism in the Civil Service is now approaching its 56thsiinivQrsary.lt has made an invaluable contribution to good staffrelations.   The high morale of the staff, and the fact that -.industrial disputes are Bare in the Civil Service, owe a greatfoal to the universal acceptance of the principle of joint consultation.   Co-operative responses to the wide-ranging changes
brought about, for example, by the introduction of computers;the acceptance of domestic   disturbances involved in the policyof dispersal of office staffs from London; and the smoothness withwhich pay settlements are generally reached and accepted, areattributable in no small measure to the activity of the staff associations in reaching agreements with management andsubsequently defending them to their members.   It is very much inthe public interest that this atmosphere of agreement and ofco-operation should be preserved.    V/e have been much impressed bythe thoughtful and constructive evidence that staff associationshave sent us, and by the interviews we haVe had with theirrepresentatives.   They can assuredly play a vital part in promoting and smoothing the way for the major reforms we recommend.We feel confident that they are willing, and indeed eager, to doso.271.   In some respects we consider that; jaanagement, constrained bythe existing structure of the Service, has allowed the Whitleysystem to operate in ways that hamper effective management:-(a) Management has entered into agreements that have producedrigid arrangements in the promotion system in whichseniority plays an excessive part.(b) Resistance to changes in organisation tends to becomeformal and institutional; this has inhibited managementfrom experimenting in the use of grades and classes.(c) Managers of &quot;operating&quot; divisions are reluctant to become involved in questions of organisation and staffing whichare often the subject of complex and delicately balancedagreements with staff associations.   These agreements arethe responsibility of the personnel and organisation
division of the department, and questions of organisationand staffing come to he regarded as their exclusiveprovince.     As a result, the manager is apt to see himself as less than fully responsible for the effectiveness of hisbranch.(d)   Success in reaching agreement with the Staff Side comes to be treated as an end in itself, and failure to reach agreement as a failure by management;    this means that negotiations are sometimes too long drawn out.272.   These defects arise in our view from two main causes.     Thefirst is the structural framework of the Service within which(Vhitleyism has had to operate and in which we have recommended a radical change.      It is because staff associations represent groupswhose careers are largely limited to a single class that they are so sensitive on such matters as promotion within it, late entry into it and the number of jobs   allocated to it.    Thesecond is that management is sometimes less active and determined thanit should be;    arguments are allowed to go on too long,and rigidprocedures are accepted where flexibility should be insisted upon.These defects however are in no way inherent in the Whit ley systemitself.     Its principles are fully compatible both with a differentstructure and with more flexible methods of consultation,273.   Our recommendations, if accepted, are bound to have a profoundeffect upon the pattern of joint consultation.     The introductionof a common grading structure;    manning the work by job evaluationrather than by reference to membership of a class;    trainingarrangements that    lead to fast promotion routes;    career managementthat   will open up new and wider prospects of promotion; an increasein late entry and short-term appointments - all of these will call forco-operation and goodwill between departments and the Staff Sudecentrally, departmentally and locally.     These changes will surelyalso lead to structural changes among the associations themselves.
274.   A remodelling of the Service on this scale is bound to imposestrains on the Official and Staff Sides alike.   There will be botha short-term and a long-term problem.    The period immediately following the publication of our report will be a particularlytesting time.    It will call for a high degree of adaptability andreadiness for speedy decision in a situation in which the long-termpattern of staff associations and joint consultation for the futurecannot yet have become completely clear.    For the longer term, wethink that the staff associations and the Civil Service department should jointly take part in a review to determine the new pattern of joint consultation that will be appropriate for the Civil service in the light of the Government&apos;s decisions on our report.   It isclearly essential that the pattern of joint consultation shouldreflect, not determine, the results of the changes we propose.We are convinced that its principles are of immense value td theService and will continue to be so.
CHAPTER 8THE CIVIL SERVICE AND THE COMMUNITY275.   We said in Chapter 1 that the Civil Service &apos;must continuouslyreview the tasks it is called on to perform and the possible ways in which it may perform them; it should then consider what newskills and kinds of men and women are needed and how they can befound&quot;.   This has led us to emphasise throughout our report thatthe Service should develop greater professionalism among bothspecialists and administrators.    Porthe specialists, it means moretraining in management and greater responsibilities.    For theadministrators, it means that the old concept of the gifted amateur,the ^11-rounder who passed easily from one job to another, should give way to one of greater specialisation.    Our proposals are,therefore, designed to create a fully professional anddynamicService.276.   It would be naive to suppose that our emphasis on professionalismwill not produce its own problems,.   All professionals lookboth inwards and outwards: inwards to their fellow-professionals,outwards to the community they exist to serve.   The Civil Servicemust keep these two aspects of professionalism in a healthy balanceand thus guard against the danger of isolation.    It is particularly important for a professional Civil Service to keep in mind that, incarrying out the tasks of modern government, it should remain theservant of democracy and be responsive to the control of Ministers.It is, too, a major public interest that the manpower of theService should be kept to the absolute minimum required for the efficient and humane discharge of its duties.   We discuss these problems in the following paragraphs; we also comment on theneed for other complementary reforms and put forward specific proposals about the implementation of our report.

We discuss these problems in the following paragraphs; we also comment on theneed for other complementary reforms and put forward specific proposals about the implementation of our report.
fTiWfiUMVTION AND SECKKCY277,   We think that the administrative process is surrounded by toornuch secrecy.     The public interest would be better served ifthere were a greater amount of openness.      The increasingly wide,,;,jijre ol&quot; problems handled by government, and their far-reachingofuvts upon the community as a whole, demand the widest possiblec. mail tntion with its different parts and interests.     We believe!.hat ouch consultation is not only necessary in it::elf but  will alsoiiEorbve the quality of the ultimate decisions and increase thegeneral understanding of their purpose.278,  We welcome the trend in recent years towarus wider and moreopen consultation before decisions are taken;    and we welcome, too,the increasing provision of the detailed information on which decisions are made.     Both should be carried much further;    it ishealthy for a democracy increasingly to press  to be consulted and informed.     There are still too many occasions where information isunnecessarily withheld and consultation merely perfunctory.      Sincegovernment decisions affect all of us in so many aspects of ourlives, consultation should be as wide as possible and should form part of the normal processes of decision-making.      It is an abuse of consultation when it is turned into a belated attempt toprepare the ground for decisions that    have in reality been takenalready,27.9. We recognise, that there must always be an element of secrecy (not simply on grounds of national security) in administration and policy-making.      At the formative stages ofpolicy-making,civil servants no less than Ministers should be ableto discuss and disagree among themselves about possible courses ofaction, without danger of their individual views becoming a matter ofpublic knowledge;    it is difficult to see how on any other basisthere can be mutual trust between colleagues and proper criticaldiscussion of different hypotheses.     But the material, and some ofthe analyses, on which these policy discussions are going forwardfall into a different category;    unless there are overriding
considerations to the contrary (e.g. on grounds of national security,the confidential nature of information supplied by individual firms,or to prevent improper financial gain), there would be positiveadvantages all round if such information were made availableto the public at the formative stage of policy-making.280.   Civil servants, and perhaps also Ministers, are apt to givegr^at ?nd sometimes excessive weight to the difficulties and problems which would undoubtedly arise from more open processes ofadministration and policy-making.    In this connection, therefore,we wish to draw attention to practice in Sweden.    At the formativestages of policy-making, there is wide and prolonged consultation,which normally takes the form of setting up a committee of inquiry;its report   is generally published; the report and the public discussion that follows are then a major part of the basis on which th(the Minister has to come to a decision.    In addition, all filesof any administrative office (in Swedish terminology, ministriesgnd agencies) are open to the press and the public if not declaredsecret on grounds of military security, good international relationsor for the protection of individuals named in them (e.g. because theymay contain criminal or medical records); when policy decisions arein preparation, however, working material is not made available for public use.   This shows that open government is possible; wesuggest th3t the Government should set up an inquiry to make recommendations for getting rid of unnecessary secrecy in thiscountry.   Clearly, the Official Secrets Acts would need to beincluded in such a review.    Some restrictions on the objective of &quot;open policy decisions openly arrived at&quot; will doubtless remainnecessary; but a mature democracy rightly demands that theyshould be kept to the absolute minimum.   The fuller the information,the closer the links between government (both Ministers and civilservants) and the community: and the smaller the gap of frustration8nd misunderstanding between &quot;them&quot; and &quot;us&quot;.
ffjjgjVIL SERVICE AND PARLIAMENT281, We should also like to see Members of Parliament morepurposively associated with the work of government than they..arenow.     The traditional methods of parliamentary scrutiny have oftenfailed to enlarge Parliaments knowledge of -what goes on or tosecure for it a proper influence;    at the same time they frequentlyimpede the efficiency of administration.     Even the work of thepublic Accounts Committee has not escaped criticism for inducinga play-safe and negative attitude among civil servants  (it has been referred to as a  &quot;negative efficiency audit1).      We have noted the potential significance of the development of  the new specialisedParliamentary Committees on agriculture, science and technology and education. We hope that these will enable M.Ps to be more closely associated with the major business of government and administration,both national and local, in these fields:   we hope, too,  that theirconsultations with departments will increasingly include civilservants below the level of Permanent Secretary.      It would be deeplyregrettable, however, if these committees became an additional brakeon the administrative process.     We hope,  therefore, that in developing this closer association with departments, parliament will concentrate on matters of real substance, and take fully intoaccount the cumulative cost (not only in time but in the quality ofadministration) that    the raising of minutiae imposes upon them.We wish to draw special attention here to our proposals in Chapter 5 for accountable management and our recommendation that departments should be organised on the basis of accountable units.As we pointed out there, these proposals entail clear delegation ofresponsibility and corresponding a uthority.      In devising a newpattern for a more purposive   association with government departments,Parliament and its committees will need to give full weight to these changes.282. We have noted the appointment of the Parliamentary Commissionerfor Administration (Ombudsman).     He has not been at work long enough
for us to assess the full implications for Ministers and the CivilService of this new office.   It is clear, however, that the officeof Parliamentary Commissioner is to be regarded as a further meansof ensuring the proper responsibility and accountability of civilservants to Parliament and to the public.Ttfft ANONYMITY OP CIVIL SERVANTS283.   The argument of the preceding paragraphs has important implications for the traditional anonymity of civil servants.    Itis already being eroded by Parliament and to a more limited extent by the pressures of the press, radio and television; the processwill continue and we see no reason to seek to reverse it.    Indeedwe think that administration suffers from the convention, which isstill alive in many fields, that only the Minister should explainissues in public and what his department is or is not doing about them.   This convention has depended in the past on the assumptionthat the doctrine of ministerial responsibility means that a minister has full detailed knowledge and control of all the activities of his department.   This assumption is no longer tenable.   The Minister andhis junior Ministers cannot know all that is going on in his department,nor can they nowadays be present at every forum where legitimatequestions are raised about its activities.    The consequence is thatsome of these questions go unanswered.   In our view, therefore theconvention of anonymity should be modified and civil servants, asprofessional administrators, should be able to go further thannow in explaining what their departments are doing, at any rateso far as concerns managing existing policies and implementinglegislation.284.   We do not under-estimate the risks involved in such a change.It is often difficult to explain without also appearing to argue;however impartially one presents the facts,there will always be those who think that the presentation is biassed.   It would be unrealistic to suppose that a civil servant will not sometimes drop8 brick and embarrass his Minister.   We belive that this will have tobe faced and that Ministers and M.P.s should take a tolerant view0f the civil servant who inadvertently steps out of line. On balance
Lthink it &quot;best not to offer any specific precepts for the progressive relaxation of the convention of anonymity.      It should he left to develop gradually and pragmatically,  though the enquiry weIhave recommended at paragraph 280 above may well result in specific recommendations on this    closely related problem.     The furtherjit develops,  the closer the links between the Service and thecommunity.^MINISTERS AND CIVIL SERVANTS-285- We considered whether we should recommend that Ministers at thehead of departments should be served by a personal cabinet on thejJFrench model, or alternatively that they should make a substantial/number of largely personal and political appointments to positions at the top of their departments as in the United States.     These are both devices which could be used to strengthen ihe Minister1 s controllof the departmental policy-making process and to increase theIfsensitiveness with which the department responds  to the needs of&quot;Parliament and the public.     We have welcomed in Chapter   1+theIntroduction of the practice whereby Ministers make a small number of temporary appointments. We think it important that Ministers should,be free to arrange for the holders of such appointments to be closely associated with the work of the many &quot;official&apos; committees (i.e.committees of civil servants without ministerial membership) whichfjinake an essential contribution to policy-making;    the work of these,committees places a heavy responsibility on civil servants to ensureIthat the choices subsequently presented to Ministers are notijunduly circumscribed* .     In Chapter 5 we also propose that fee minister should be assisted by a Senior Policy Adviser as well as by aPermanent Secretary and we suggested that the Minister fs own methodsiof working would determine the pattern of relationships at the toppd the precise division of responsibilities.     These developmentsOne of us (Dr. Norman Hunt) considers that junior Minis ters should;80;be members of the more important of these committees.     at  esent junior Ministers are sometimes not in a position to make aoffi C01ntribut;Lon t0 departmental work.     Their inclusion in(Wx    committees could strengthen the political direction ofrePartments.
should increase the control of Ministers over the formulation ofpolicy in their departments.    In the light of them   (taken inconjunction mth our proposals in the next paragraph), we see no needfor ministerial cabinets or for political appointments on a large scale.286.   A related issue is the extent to which a Minister should be free to change the staff immediately surrounding him.    There isno problem about those who have been personally appointed on atemporary basis by his predecessor; when a new Minister comes in,they will go anyway. Thus the issue really arises only over the positions of the Permanent Secretary, the Senior Policy Adviserand the Private Secretary.   Because of the nature of the private secretary&apos;s duties, he must be personally acceptable to his minister; there should therefore, in our view, be no obstacle in theway of a Minister selecting from within the department, or on occasion more widely within the Service, as his Private secretary the individual best suited to his ways of working; no stigma shouldattach to a person who is moved out of this job.    As far asSenior Policy Advisers are concerned (whether career civil servantsor those appointed from outside the Service on a short-term basis), we would hope that,as they will be selected for this jobas men of technical competence and vitality, Ministers will not normally wish to replace them.    This must however be possible when a new Minister finds the current holder of this office too closelyidentified with, or wedded to, policies that he wishes to change;or when an adviser&apos;s capacity for producing and making use of newideas declines.    It should be more exceptional, however, for a minister to change his Permanent Secretary.   Ministers change often,whereas the running of a department requires continuity.   Even so,Ministers should not be stuck with Permanent Secretaries who are too rigid or tired.   Any changes of this kind affecting SeniorPolicy Advisers or Permanent Secretaries will require the most careful consideration by the Head of the Civil Service and thePrime Minister, whose joint task it is in this context to safeguard the Political neutrality of the higher Civil Service.
SERVING THE COMMUNITY287.   It is manifestly in the interests both of the Service and ofthe community at large that they should not be remote from one another.    In the past the Administrative Class of the Civil service has been on easy and familiar terms with the learned professions, andparticularly with the older universities; less so with the worldof industry and commerce; familiar with London; less so with the regions; and so on.    We would wish,not that familiar relationshipsshould be lost, but that they should be enlarged and made more comprehensive.288.   Where recruitment is concerned, we hope that the proposals we have made in Chapter 3 will increase the attractiveness of theCivil Service to the graduates of the great civic and the neweruniversities.    We have noted with satisfaction the recent trend towards an enlarged entry to the Administrative Class from theseuniversities.   Those of us who propose that emphasis should beplaced in selection on the relevance of subjects studied for degreesbelieve that this development will give further impetus to the trend.In addition, a graduate entry drawn from a wider range of universities should help to ensure that the graduate recruits tothe Civil Service become more representative, geographically,educationally and socially, of the nation at large than they havebeen in the past; we regard this as a desirable objective in itself.289.   We have also set out in Chapters 3 and k our proposals for thesharing of post-entry training with staff from nationalised and private industry, business and local government, and for a greaterflow, both of &quot;outsiders&quot; coming in for varying periods to work in deparments, and of civil servants going to take part in workoutside. We regard these proposals as a means not only ofincreasing the effectiveness of Civil Service work but also of avoiding the risks of professional isolation.
290.   We are aware that service to the community demands morethan greater professionalism and efficiency.    In formulating our recommendations we have tried throughout to bear in mind the overriding importance of good relations between the Service andthe public.    As the responsibilities of government have widened,so has the influence for good or ill of the Service itself.Ordinary citizens confront the State at many points in theireveryday life: it taxes them and determines their rights to social benefits; it provides for the education of their children and the protection of their families&apos; health.    As householders,many are dependent on the State&apos;s housing policies; as employers or employees, they are deeply affected by its success or failurein its management of the national economy.    In practice, most people can discharge many of their obligations to their familiesonly with the help of the services provided and controlled bythe State.    The Civil Service, as the agent of the State, is bound constantly to touch very sensitive nerves.    In consequence,its qualities of integrity, understanding and efficiency areprofoundly important to ordinary men and women.291.   We believe that the measures we have proposed can make a contribution to a closer relationship between the Civil Serviceand the community,    ^ut this problem has to be grasped in the wider context of other, complementary reforms, which go well beyond the reform oh the Civil Service.COMPLEMENTARY REFORMS292.   Our proposals for the reform of the Civil Service need to beseen as part of the more general reappraisal t/hat is being made ofour inherited forms of government and social and economic organisation.   For example, since we began our work royal commissions have been asked to examine the structure of local
government in England and Scotland; the Royal Commission on trade Unions and Employers1 Associations has already reported;Parliament is modernising its procedures.   The ability of thegovernment to promote the country&apos;s well-being requires more thanthe reform of the Civil Service-; so we attach great importanceto the outcome of these other wide-ranging enquiries anddevelopments, particularly those that affect the relationships between central and local government, between central governmentand private and nationalised industry, and between governmentdepartments and Parliament.293.   In-this connection we considered whether we should propose a major review of the whole machinery of government, which has not beensystematically examined by an outside body since the HaldaneCommittee in 1918.   A number of witnesses who gave evidence to usthought that such a review was needed.    Certainly, the division ofresponsibility between departments, and the lines drawn between the responsibilities of central government and those of other public bodies, have a decisive influence upon the work of the Civil Service.The speed and effectiveness of decision-making are inevitablyaffected when, under the current organisation of the work ofgovernment, several departments have a legitimate interest in mostmajor social and economic problems; and when these problemsaccordingly have to be handled through a large network of departmentaland inter-departmental committees.   Machinery of government,however, was outside our terms of reference and we have not examinedwhether or not there wqs merit in the proposals put to us on thissubject; but if the review of &quot;hiving off&quot; which we have proposed in chapter 5 recommended substantial changes, this would also providethe opportunity for simultaneous consideration to be given to ageneral review of the machinery of government.MANPOWER2%.   Throughout our work we have been conscious of the widespreadPublic concern over the growing size of the Civil Service.   the size of the Service (excluding the Post Office) since 1950 is shown below:-

The figures are		included in the	other columns.^&apos; Includes the Diplomatic Service  which numbered 13,000 on  1st January    1968.295. Naturally, the size of the Service is related to the size of the tasks directly carried out by the government.   Today, although the Serviceaccounts overall for less than 2% of the working population, the figuresconceal a larger claim on the qualified manpower of the country.    It isregrettable that Civil Service and national statistics are inadequate totell whether this claim is a growing one relative to other employments.But it is clear for example that the proportion of school-leavers with two or more &quot;A levels&quot; and equivalent qualifications in 1965 who joined the Civil Service was substantial.    It is, therefore, of greatimportance to ensure that the Service uses its qualified manpower asefficiently and economically as possible.296 . Looking to the future, the Treasury have supplied us with short-termforecasts of the numbers of recruits who are expected to be needed, andthe Department of Education and Science with longer-term projectionsof the output of the educational system, both at the various levels of educational qualification.    We publish these papers, with otherstatistical material, in Volume h, Section II.   On the supply side, thereis likely to be a shift in the pattern.   Two main points are ofParticular significance.   First, the actual output from the educational system to the labour market will increase at each of the graduate,&apos; A level.&quot; and &quot;0 level&quot; output points.    Secondly, however, within theseall-round figures, the increase in the output of graduates will be^proportionately greater than the increase in the &quot;A level&quot; output, andpe increase in the &quot;A level&quot; output will be proportionatelypreater     than     at   &quot;0 level&quot;.
On the demand side, the future is necessarily more obscure.   Wethink however that the general trend,   a continuing rise In thedemand for qualified manpower,     which seems to be common to alladvanced countries, is likely to be reflected in the british civil Service as the work demands increasingly advanced managementtechniques and higher technological sophistication.   We would thereforeexpect a steady advance in the standards of skill and qualification of the Civil Service as a whole.   We discuss the effect of thistrend on the recruitment of graduates to the Service in Appendix P.297.   We see no reason in principle why the Civil Service shouldnot be able in future to recruit the numbers of staff it needs, though there are, and will no doubt continue to be, temporary shortages of people with specific kinds of skill.   The Service will however need to be truly competitive in what it offers,if it is to attractits share of really able men and women at all levels; our proposals are intended to make it so.298. We are conscious that some of our own proposals call for increases in qualified staff.   The main proposals that do so are:-(a) the establishment of Planning Units;(b) the creation of a Civil Service College and the expansionof t;he training programme;(c) greater attention by departments to personnel management and career development;(d) the expansion of departmental management services in thecasue of increased efficiency and economy;(e) the new Civil Service Department, which with its increasedresponsibilities will need to be larger than the present&quot;Pay and Management&quot;group of the Treasury.In addition, she new grading-system we have recommended in&quot;Chapter 6 will require a comprehensive job evaluation throughout theService; we doubt if it can be done without a further, even iftemporary, increase&apos; of staff.$9.   These increases must be viewed both against the size of theService as a whole and against the benefits they will bring.   As tothe former, they are likely to be relatively very small, though as a
-     307claim on qualified manpower, they will be more sigrificant.   Thecase for them however depends wholly upon the latter; we canjustify them only by the results we expect them to achieve.300. We believe that the reforms we propose are necessary to makethe Civil Service equal to the tasks of modern Government.    In spiteof the increases in staff to which we have referred, we believethat they will also lead in the end to worthwhile economies and greater efficiency in the use of manpower.   This is not because we have found civil servants to be under-employed today.   But weare not convinced that every job they do is essential in order tomeet the demands which are placed on the Service by the country;there is not in our view adequate machinery for ensuring that thisis so.   We therefore set great store by the potential gains fromthe large-scale programme of job evaluation we have called for in Chapter 3 and from the expansion of management servicesproposed in Chapter 5.   Together, they should do muchto ensure that the nation  gets value for money-,,by providing a built-in safeguard against over-staffing, both in quantity andin quality.301, We stress that Ministers and civil servants alike should keepthe need for economy in administration constantly in mind in devisingtheir policies. Increasing   sophistication in the methods andtechniques of government ,   for example in those that arise from thelarge-scale introduction of computers ,   offers constant temptationsto go in for complexity.   Even in a computer age, complexity coststime and money - a cost which often falls upon the organisations and individuals who have to respond to new government initiativesas well as upon the government itself.   Since most new legislationinvolves additional tasks for civil servants, we attach considerable importance to the developing practice of recent years whereby new policy proposals are accompanied by detailed estimates of manpowercoats.   We think that these, no less than other costs, should be thesubject of parliamentary and public debate.   Simplicity, and thuseconomy, in administration should be a constant goal.   We wouldalso add that where work can be done more economically by outsideOrganisations, the Civil Service should always be ready to take
advantage of this. -   _    OdO^IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR PROPOSALS302.   We have not spared our criticisms of the way in which theService is run and of its other defects.    We have however beendeeply impressed by its very considerable strengths: its integrity,humanity, willingness at every level to carry the load of detailed work which composes so large a part of the country&apos;s public business.    Any Minister or Parliamentary Secretary who has everhad to carry a complicated Bill through Parliament or to bear the brunt of an unpopular policy, knows this well.   We have seen too,in the evidence we have received from civil servants, many signs   ofa strong desire that the organisation within which they do their work should be remodelled to enable them to do it more effectively.303.   Fully to implement our recommendations will naturally takea number of years.    It will call for much discussion, especially with the vsrious staff associations.    As a first priority, however,there is an immediate need to:-(a) set up the new Civil Service Department,designed and staffedto carry out the basic principles of our recommendations;(b) set up an extensive training programme, so that presentcivil servants who have not been given adquateopportunities for training in the past can acquire theknowledge and skills they need.304,   For the longer term we hope that the government will take stepsto review the progress made in implementing our proposals.    Thisoould be by means of an annual report to Parliament duringthe next five years.    Alternatively, the Government might considerwhether there is a need at the end of that period to set up asmall commitee to review progress and report to Parliaments.ive of us (Sir Philip Allen   Mr   WO   Anders on, Bir^mes^unnett,Sir Norman Kipping and Lord Simey) hope i:na ^ yegrgwhich has been in a state of ^certainty during ng ^ &amp;have been sitting, will not have to face tnep^y   on ^ uby another committee after five years.   A ^mmi ^ implementatl0nsuggested would hardly limit Itseiiof our proposals.
305.   A modern Civil Service reconstructed on the basis of theseproposals (some of which are elaborated in more detail in thevarious appendices to this volume) will, we believe, make possiblethe progressive and efficient conduct of our affairs.3O6.   We have made far-reaching proposals on many important matters.We know that they will not be easy to carry out.   A great deal of prolonged, difficult and complicated work will be needed.   Wehave seen that the Service has men and women with the ability, vision&quot;and enthusiasm to carry the task through to success.   The new service they will be creating will be one that offers astimulating and challenging career to the men and women who workin it.
ipReservation to Chapter I - -I sign Chapter 1 of the Report subject to the followingreservations .2,    I think that the chapter is unfair to the Civil Service.    while agree that far-reaching changes are now desirable, the chapter fails to recognise, in my opinion, the contemporary relevance of the greatcontribution the Service made to the successful conduct of the warand, subsequently, in the transition from war to peace.    I believethat full recognition should be accorded to the British Civil service for its many achievements and qualities, and that the chapter&apos;semphasis on the Service&apos;s present shortcomings gives a misleading impression of its future potentials.    The Committee were told in france that those who were responsible for remodelling the FrenchCivil Service at the end of the war had much in mind the qualities of the British Administrative Class.    There have been recommendationsalso from time to time in the U.S.A., that something equivalent tothe British Administrative Class might, with advantage, be established.3.    Whilst it is no doubt true to say that the foundations of theCivil Service were laid in the second half of the nineteenth century-it is surely also true that the main characteristics it displaystoday are mid-twentieth century developments.   Although its creationhas been called &apos;the one great political invention of nineteenth century England&apos;, it is also evident that its continued growth is anachievement of our own times.    The Northcote-Trevelyan reforms ledto the creation of the Civil Service Commission, the open competition and to a structure which was the forerunner of what we have today.But events alone have produced a very different and more positive-minded Administrative Class over the years, starting perhaps withLloyd George&apos;s Insurance Act, followed by two World &quot;Wars and allthe developments since.    After each of the World Wars the Servicelri fact did a good deal to reorganise itself and, if it has not goneas far as is called for in fully integrating the professional classesof the Service, the place that they have been given since the Secondi World War is very different from the one that they held before.
f;r     What we have now to face is essentially a situation which has arisen in the post-war world: this requires a capacity to face the truth at all costs, however inconvenient it may he to do so.    this capacity is, I &quot;believe, already available to us in the CivilService as it exists at present, but a degree of reorganisation and further development is required if its fullest potentialitiesare to be made available to us.    This is common g round.    I am therefore disappointed that  the proposals embodied in this report,and foreshadowed in the present chapter, assume that what isrequired is something approaching revolutionary changes.    My own view is that necessary reforms could be obtained by encouraging the evolution, of what is basically the present situation, given thenecessary amendments in direction and emphasis.   The Treasuryproposals before us already suggest many ways in which this may beachieved.5.    In particular, I do not agree that &quot;the Service is essentiallybased on the philosophy of the amateur (or  &apos;generalist&apos; or &quot;all-rounder&apos;).&quot;       It has recently been pointed out that specialisationwithout a broad basis of foundation knowledge has profounddisadvantages.    It is true that modern economic and politicalorganization needs high specialism, but it also needs more generalqualities of judgement and decisiveness, and the ability tounderstand how the reshaping of values may be embodied in andimplemented by public policy.    In effect, both specialists andgeneralists are required, and the problem becomes one of relationshipsand responsibilities, rather than the exclusion of the one in favourof the other.   Modern techniques, such as linear programming, costbenefit analysis and other methods of specialised analysis are clearly needed and should be used to the full in the Civil Service.They do not, however, supersede the importance of the fundamentalqualities of judgement which are vital to the successful prosecution of government business.So far as generalist knowledge and experience are concerned,1 am sure that Macaulay&apos;s argument was right and that the Civil
gervice needs nothing more, and nothing less, than the hest brainsjlyiown to teachers in schools and universities.    I have littlesympathy with the argument that the Civil Service of today must befundamentally changed because the Administrative Glass whichdominates it is typified by the  &quot;gifted amateur&apos;.    In the finance and Public Sector sides of the Treasury there is an immense amountof expert knowledge in the Administrative Glass and, althoughprofessional economists have helped, administrators have beenvery much to the fore in such matters as the better long-term planning of public expenditure.    The charge of amateurism can indeed be pressed&apos; to a point where it puts too much importance on knowledgeacquired and formally recognised by the award of a degree orprofessional qualification before a man enters the Service, andrecognises too little the knowledge gained after joining.   There are signs that big employers in industry are not now very interested insubject a man has read for a degree, unless they want him for scientific research, and the Administrative Glass has in any case to face a problem of communication with non-experts in the form ofMinisters and Committees of the House of Commons, which is fundamentallydifferent from anything that industry has experienced.    I do not therefore accept that there is a &quot;cult of the generalist&quot; in theService today or that the &quot;generalist&quot; is obsolete at all levels.7.    More has already been done to improve the efficiency of theService than the report recognises.    There is still a long way to goin devising more effective forms of organisation, but the experienceof, for example, Canada casts doubt on the suggestion that are organisation of class structure will of itself help the service to work more smoothly.   Reform should be discriminating.    Thestatement that nowhere has it run ahead too rapidly takes no accountof the informed criticism that too many economists have been introduced into the Service in recent years , in too short a time tomake it possible to deploy their services to best effect.   although there may be a need for more knowledge in the Service of economicsthis cannot be obtained only be reoruiting more specialist economists.Diminishing returns, it has been pointed out, are to be expected as
Simey of Toxteth.their number grows.8.    In my opinion, it is evident that there is substantial agreement concerning the chief requirements of Civil Service reform,necessary to enable the Service to meet the rapidly changing demandsof the present day more effectively.    I agree that it was in the1950&apos;s that it became apparent that the Service was not abreast of change; but I consider that it was only then that this happened.I therefore believe that the correct interpretation of the evidencesummarised in this Chapter must lead to the conclusion that the taskbefore us is not one of the total reconstruction of an obsoleteinstitution.    On the contrary, I am convinced that we have in theexisting Civil Service an asset which it would be utterly foolishto discard.    Its potentialities provide a more than adequate basis for any reforms that may be necessary both in the immediate and long term future.I have not sought to associate my Civil Service colleagues with me in stating this dissenting opinion.
-    314SUMMARY OF MAIN FINDINGS &quot; &quot;1,    The Home Civil Service today is still fundamentally the product of the nineteenth-century philosophy of the N ort he o t e-TrevelyanReport.   The problems it faces are those of the second half of thetwentieth century. In spite of its many strengths, it is inadequatein six main respects for the most efficient discharge of thepresent and prospective responsibilities of government:-(a) It is still too much based on the philosophy of theamateur (or &quot;generalist&quot; or &quot;all-rounder&quot;).   This is mostevidence in the Administrative Class which holds the dominant position in the Service.(b) The present system of classes in the Service (there are over 1400, each for the most part with its own separatepay and career structure) seriously impedes its work.Ic)   Scientists, engineers and members of other specialist&apos;classes are frequently given neither the fullresponsibilities and opportunities nor the correspondingauthority they ought to have.(d) Too few civil servants are skilled managers.(e) There is not enough contact between the Service and thecommunity it is there to serve.(f) Personnel management and career planning are inadequate.For these and other defects the central management of the Service,the Treasury, must accept its share of responsibility.2.    We propose a simple guiding principle for the future.   TheService must continuously review the tasks it is called on to perform; it should then think out what new skills and kinds of menare needed and how these men can be found, trained and deployed.3.    A new Civil Service Department should be set up with widerfunctions than those now performed by the &quot;Pay and ManagementK group of the Treasury, which it should take over.   The new department should also absorb the Civil Service Commission.^    The new department should be under the control of the Prime
Minister.   We hope that he will retain direct responsibility for senior appointments, machinery of government and questions of security.   Outside this area, we suggest that the Prime minister should delegate day to day responsibility to a non-departmental minister of appropriate seniority who is also a member of theCabinet.5,    The Permanent Secretary of the Civil Service Department shouldbe designated Head of the Home Civil Service.6,    All classes should be abolished and replaced by a single,unified grading structure covering all civil servants from top tobottom in the non-industrial part of the Service.   The correctgrading of each post should be determined by job evaluation.7,    The Service should develop greater professionalism both amongspecialists (e.g. scientists and engineers) and administrators(i.e. the new counterparts of the present Administrative and ExecutiveClasses).   For the former this means more training in minsgament, and opportunities for greater responsibility and wider careers.   Forthe latter it means enabling them to specialise in particular areas ofgovernment.   We identify two such areas and accordingly recommend the development of a group of economic and financial administrators,and a second group of social administrators.8,    Employing departments should have a larger role in recruitment and there should be a speeding up of procedures.      A majority of us consider that in the recruitment of graduates for one or other of the groups of administrators sore account should be taken of therelevance of their university courses for the job they are beingrecruited to do.9.    A Civil Service College should be set up.   It should providemajor training courses in administration and management and a wide range of shorter course.   It should also have important researchfunctions.   The courses provided by the College should not be restricted to civil servants; a proportion of places should be set aside for men and women from private industrial and commercial firms,local government and public corporations.10. More resources should be devoted to the career management ofaH civil servants.   All must have the opportunity to progress as
far as their talents and appropriate training can take them.This involves major changes in promotion procedures.11.  While the Civil Service should remain predominantly a careerService, there should be greater mobility between it and other employments.   We, therefore, recommend an expanded late entry,temporary appointments for fixed periods, short-term interchanges ofstaff and freer movement out of the Service.   These proposals involvesubstantial changes in the pension scheme and the replacement of&quot;established&quot; status by new terms of employment.12,  In the interests of efficiency, the principles of accountablemanagement should be applied to the organisation of the work of departments.   This means the clear allocation of responsibility and authority to accountable units with defined objectives.   It alsomeans a corresponding addition to the system of government accounting.13.  Management services units with highly qualified and experiencedstaff should be set up in all major departments.H.  Departments should establish Planning Units.15.  In addition to the Permanent Secretary, there should also bein most departments a Senior Policy Adviser to assist the Minister.The Senior Policy Adviser would normally be head of the PlanningUnit.   His prime job would be to ;look to and prepare for the future and to ensure that present policy decisions are taken with as full a recognition as possible of likely future developments.16.  In some of the big technical departments, there may be a needfor a further job; a chief scientist,   engineer or other specialist.17,  We do not propose that the Senior Policy Adviser and chief.specialist, together with the Permanent Secretary, shouldconstitute a formal board.   The working arrangements should be -informal and variable from department to department and from timeto time; different Ministers&apos; Individual ways of working will doauch to determine the pattern.18.  xhere should be flne man who has overall responsibility underthe Minister for all the  fairs of the Department and he shouldcontinue to be the Permanent Secretary.19. A Minister at the head of a department should be able to employ
. 317on a temporary basis such small numbers of experts as he personallyconsider he needs to help him.20,  We have suggested a number of further inquiries.   Their subjects,among others, should ber-(a) the desirability of &quot;hiving off activities to non-departmental organisations;(b) ways and means of getting rid of unnecessary secrecy both in policy-making and in administration;(c) the new pattern of joint consultation that will be appropriate for the Civil Service in the light of theGovernment&apos;s decisions on our report.   This inquiry shouldbe conducted jointly by the Civil Service Department andthe staff associations^(d) methods of making recruitment procedures as speedy andObjective as possible.21.   If our proposals are accepted, we hope that the Government willtake steps to see that the progress made in their implementationis reviewed.   This could be by an annual report to Parliamentduring the next five years.   A small committee might be set up atthe end of that period if needed.22.  We have seen that the Service has men and women with the ability, visien and enthusiasm needed to carry our proposals through to success.   A Civil Service reconstructed on the basis of theseproposals will, we believe, make possible the; progressive and efficient conduct of our affairs.
Royal Commission on the Civil Service 1929-31 (CMND.3909). Roy&amp;1 Commission on the Civil Service 1953-55 (CMND.9613)APPENDIX AThe scope of our ^nquiryWe were appointed on 8th February, 1966 to &quot;examine the structure, recruitment and management, including training, of theHome Civil service, and to make recommendations&quot;.2,    The Prime Minister, in his statement in the House of Commons,said that the decision to set up a Committee was reached in view ofthe changes which had taken place in the demands placed upon theCivil Service and of the changes in the country&apos;s educational system:   and that the time had come to ensure that the Service wasproperly equipped for its role in the modern State.   He added thatthe Governments willingness to consider changes in the CivilService &quot;does not imply any intention on their part to alter the basic relationship between Ministers and civil servants.   Civilservants, however eminent, remain the confidential advisers ofMinisters, who alone are answerable to Parliament for policy; and wedo not envisage any change in this fundamental feature of ourparliamentary system of democracy&quot;.3.    Our terms of reference refer to the &quot;Home Civil Service&quot;, andthus exclude the Diplomatic Service.   The Home Civil Service isnot easy to define precisely, but we have found it convenientbroadly to follow the last two Royal Commissions on the Civil Service*in adopting &quot;Servants of the Crown, other than holders of political or judicial offices, who are employed in a civil capacity and whoseremuneration is paid wholly and directly out of moneys voted byParliament&quot;.   This includes both permanent and temporary staff in public departments but excludes the staff of such bodies as the research Councils, whose organisation, pay and conditions are similarto those of the Civil Service.k.    This definition also excludes the staff of the Post Office, whosesalaries are not voted by Parliament but are paid out of Post Officereceipts.   They have continued to be civil servants by virtue of thePost Office Act, 1961, but we decided to omit them from our inquiry
- ^ 319following the Government&apos;s announcement that legislation will shortly be introduced to separate the Post Office from the CivilService.   We have also followed the precedent of previousinquiries in omitting all industrial staff.    The National board for Prices and Incomes recommended in their report No.  18 ofJune, 1966 that the Government should aim over a period to buildon what is common to the industrial and non-industrial parts of theService with the ultimate objective of according equality of statusto all government servants.    This objective has been accepted, butthe structure, management etc. of industrial staff are speciallyand separately determined and we decided that we could not examinetheir different problems.    Unless otherwise stated, all figuresouoted in our report exclude both Post Office and industrial staff.5.    The field of our inquiry is thus the non-industrial staff ofthe Civil Service, excluding the Diplomatic Service and thePost Office.    On 1st January, 1968, they numbered 1*59,000.6,     Our terms of reference excluded the machinery of government.We found at many points of our inquiry that this imposed limits onour work; questions about the number and size of departments, andthoir relationships with each other and the Cabinet Office, bearclosely upon the work and organisation of the Civil Service.We have recommended (in Chapter 5) that the Government should examine the possibility of &quot;hiving off&quot; a number of functions nowdischarged by departments and entrusting them to independent public bodies; and we express the view (in Chapter 8) that this examinationmay also provide an opportunity for a wider review of the machineryof government.
L.     THE NORTHCOTE-TREVELYAN REPORTREPORT ON THE ORGANISATION OF THE PERMANENT CIVIL SERVICEPresented to^both Houses of Parliament by CommandJ[of Her MajestyWe now proceed to comply with that part of our instructions which states that, in connection withthe inquiries which we were directed Jo make intoeach particular office, it is highly necessary that theconditions which are common to all the publicestablishments, such as the preliminary testimonialsof character and bodily health to be required fromcandidates for public employment, the examinationinto their intellectual attainments, and the regulationof the promotions, should be carefully considered,so as to obtain full security for the public that nonebut qualified persons will be appointed, and thatthey will afterwards have every practicable induce-mcnt to the active discharge of their duties.It cannot be necessary to enterottance of &apos;nt0 anv lengthened argument forthe Permanent . the purpose of showing the highcivil service importance of the Permanent CivilService of the country in the present day. The great and increasing accumulation ofpublic business, and the consequent pressure uponthe Government, need only be alluded to ; and theinconveniences which are inseparable from thefrequent changes which take place in the responsibleadministration are matter of sufficient notoriety.It may safely be asserted that, as matters now stand,the Government of the country could not be carriedon without the aid of an efficient body of permanentofficers, occupying a position duly subordinate tothat of the Ministers who are directly responsible tothe Crown and to Parliament, yet possessingsufficient independence, character, ability, and experience to be able to advise, assist, and to someextent, influence, those who are from time to timeset over them.That the Permanent Civil Service,its merits with all its defects, essentially con-generally tributes to the proper discharge ofacknowledsed      the functions of Government, hasbeen repeatedly admitted by thosewho have successively been responsible for theconduct of our affairs.  All, however, who havehad occasion to examine its con-/iA stitution with care, have felt that itslt&apos;f&apos;c&quot; organisation is far from perfect, andthat its amendment is deserving ofthe most careful attention.It would be natural to expect that so important a profession would attract into its ranks the ablest andthe most ambitious of the youth ofthe country ; that the keenest cmu-iation would prevail among those who had enteredit: and that such as were endowed with superiorIt does notattract theablest menqualifications would rapidly rise to distinction andpublic eminence. Such, however, is by no means the case. Admission into the CivilService is indeed eagerly sought Ntiturf tit itsafter, but it is for the unambitious, muuie,im,i,and the indolent or incapable, thatit is chiefly desired. Those whose abilities do not warrant an expectation that they will succeed in the open professions, where they must encounter thecompetition of their comtemporarics, and thosewhom indolence of temperament, or physicalinfirmities unfit for active exertions, arc placed in theCivil Service, where they may obtain an honourablelivelihood with little labour, and with no risk ;where their success depends upon their simplyavoiding any flagrant misconduct, and attendingwith moderate regularity to routine duties ; and inwhich they are secured against the ordinary con-sequences of old age, or failing health, by an arrange-ment which provides them with the means of supporting themselves after they have becomeincapacitated.It may be noticed in particular that the comparativelightness of the work, and the certainty of provision in case of retirement owing to bodily incapacity,furnish strong inducements to the parents andfriends of sickly youths to endeavour to obtain forthem employment in the service of the Government ;and the extent to which the public are consequentlyburdened, first with the salaries of officers who are obliged to absent themselves from their duties onaccount of ill-health, and afterwards with their pensions when they retire on the same plea, would hardly be credited by those who have not hadopportunities of observing the operation of thesystem.It is not our intention to suggest that all public servants entered the employment of the Govern-ment with such views as these ; but we apprehendthat as regards a large proportion of them, thesemotives more or less influenced those who acted forthem in the choice of a profession ; while, on theother hand, there are probably very few who havechosen this line of life with a view to raising them-selves to public eminence.The result naturally is, that thepublic service suffers both in internal r**efficiency and in public estimation. r&quot;u&quot;The character of the individualsinfluences the mass, and it is thus that we often hearcomplaints of official delays, official evasions of difficulty, and official indisposition to improvement.There are, however, numerous honourable excep-tions to these observations, and the trustworthiness3THE NORTHC0TE-TREVELYAN AND MACAULAY REPORTS
of the entire body is unimpeached. They are much better than wc have any right to expect from thesystem under which they arc appointed and pro-meted.The   peculiar   difficulties  underwituuMtsuj      which the Permanent Civil ServicecimV service   labours, in obtaining a good supplyof men, as compared with other professions, are partly natural and partly artificial.Its natural difficulties are such as these:--Those who enter it generally do soYuuih u) those at an early age, when there has been&quot;&quot;&quot; &quot;        no opportunity of trying their fitnessfor business, or forming a trust-worthy estimate of their characters and abilities.This to a great extent is the case in other professionsalso, but those professions supply athwiweoi corrective which is wanting in thecompetition        Civil Service, for as a man&apos;s success in them depends upon his obtainingand retaining the confidence of the public, and as heis exposed to a sharp competition on the part of hiscontemporaries, those only can maintain a fairposition who possess the requisite amount of ability and industry for the proper discharge of their duties. The able and energetic rise to the top ; thedull and inefficient remain at the bottom, in thepublic establishments, on the contrary, the general rule is that all rise together. After a young man hasbeen once appointed, the public have him for life ;and if he is idle or inefficient, provided he does notgrossly misconduct himself, we must either submit to have a portion of the public business inefficientlyand discreditably performed, or must place theincompetent person on the retired list, with a pension for the rest of his life.  The feeling of security whichthis state of things necessarily en-ferimg of genders tends to encourage indolence,insecurity and thereby to depress the characterof the Service. Again, those who are admitted into it at an early age are thereby relieved from the necessity of those struggles which for ihemost part fall to the lot of such asunited Jpun .        fPro,rr Jexperience of      their course is one of quiet, and generally of secluded, performance of routine duties, and they conse-quently have but limited opportunities of acquiringthat varied experience of life which is so important to the development of character.To these natural difficulties may be added othersarising from what may be called artificial causes.The character of the young menEffects of admitted to the public service de-fr/fa^Min&quot;- psnds chiefly upon the discretionmenu with which the heads of departments,and others who are entrusted withthe distribution of patronage, exercise that privilege.In those cases in which the patronage of departmentsbelongs to their chief for the time being, the appoint-ments which it commonly falls to his lot to make are either those of junior clerks, to whom no very important duties are in the first instance to be assigned, or of persons who are to fill responsibleand highly paid situations above the rank of theordinary clerkships. lnthclirslca.se.as the character and abilities of thenew junior clerk will produce but    uppoimm, ,.i ujlittle immediate ellccl upon the ollicc,       I&quot;&quot;&apos;&quot;&apos; cl&quot;k&apos;the   chief  of  the   department   is naturally led to regard the selection as a matter ofsmall moment, and will probably bestow the olliceupon the son or dependent of someone havingpersonal or political claims upon him, or perhapsupon the son of some meritorious public servant.without instituting any very minute inquiry into the merits of the young man himself.   It is true that inmany offices some kind of examination is prescribed,and that in almost nil the person appointed is in thelirst instance nominated on probation ; but, as willpresently be pointed out. neither of these tests are atpresent very efficacious.   The youngman thus admitted is commonly ,,   .i        , ,   , .... . Hnunnfemployed upon duties of the merest        character oiroutine.   Many of the first years of        ,/&quot;&quot;his service are spent in copyingpapers, and other work of an almost mechanicalcharacter,   In two or three years he is as good as hecan be at such an employment.   The remainder ofhis official life can only exercise a depressing in-fluence on him, and renders the work of the officedistasteful to him.   Unlike the pupil in a convcy-ancer&apos;s or special pleader&apos;s office, he not only beginswith mechanical labour as an introduction to labour of a higher kind, but often also endswith it.   In the meantime his salary       Hrumuliun byis gradually advancing till he reaches \entoriiyby seniority, the top of his class, andon the occurrence of a vacancy in the class abovehim he is promoted to fill it, as a matter of course,and without any regard to his previous services or his qualifications. Thus, while no pains have beentaken in the first instance to secure a good man forthe office, nothing has been done after the clerk&apos;appointment to turn his abilities,whatever they may be, to the best superioraccount. The result naturally is appointmentthat when the chief of the office has sflmtmto make an appointment of visibleand immediate importance to the efficiency of his department, he sometimes has difficulty in finding aclerk capable of filling it, and he is not infrequentlyobliged to go out of the office, and to appoint someone of high standing in an open profession, orsomeone distinguished in other walks of life, overthe heads of men who have been for many years inthe public service. This is necessarily discouragingto the Civil Servants, and tends to strengthen in them the injurious conviction, that their success doesnot depend upon their own exertions, and that if theywork hard, it will not advance them if they wastetheir time in idleness, it will not keep them back.It is of course essential to thepublic service that men of the high- siagest abilities should be selected for the a,.poinimmnhighest posts, and it cannot be denied that there are a few situations in which suchvaried talent and such an amount of experience arerequired, that it is probable that under any circum-stances it will occasionally be found necessary to4
(ill them with persons who have distinguished them-sc,&apos; &quot;&quot;&quot;^elsewhere than in the Civil Service. But thesv . of appointing strangers to the higher officeshas been carried far beyond this. In several depart-inents the clerks arc regarded as having no claimwhatever to what arc called the staff appointments;and numerous instances might be given in whichpersonal or political considerations have led to theappointment of men of very slender ability, and perhaps of questionable character, to situations ofconsiderable emolument, over the heads of public servants of long standing and undoubted merit,F:ew public servants would feel the appointment of abarrister of known eminence and ability to some important position, like that of Under Secretary ofState, as a slight, or a discouragement to themselves ;but the case is otherwise when someone who has failed in other professions, and who has no recom-mendation but that of family or political interest, is appointed to a Librarianship, or some other suchoffice, the duties of which would have been far better discharged by one who had been long in thedepartment, and to whom the increased salaryattached to the appointment would have been a fairreward for years of faithful service.One more peculiarity in the Civil, menlan, Service remains to be noticed. It is/kmiKtrfaf iitr what may be called its fragmentary&quot;&quot;*&quot; character.Unlike the Military and Naval,the Medical, and the commissariat services, andunlike even the Indian Civil Service, the publicestablishments of this country, though comprising a body of not less than 16,000 persons, are regulatedupon the principle of merely departmental pro-motion. Each man&apos;s experience, interests, hopes,and fears are limited to the special branch of service in which he is himself engaged. The effect naturallyis, to cramp the energies of the whole body, toencourage the growth of narrow views and depart-mental prejudices, to limit the acquisition of ex-perience, and to repress and almost extinguish thespirit of emulation and competition : besides which,considerable inconvenience results from the want of facilities for transferring strength from an officewhere the work is becoming slack to one in whichit is increasing, and from the consequent necessityof sometimes keeping up particular departments ona scale beyond their actual requirements.Having thus touched upon someHow best to of the difficulties with which themenV&quot;?&quot; public service is beset, we come topiihlir &apos;. - lice       the consideration of the problem.What is the best method of providingit with a supply of good men, and of making themost of them after they have been admitted.The first question which here presents itself is,whether it is better to train young men for thedischarge of the duties which they will afterwardshave to perform, or to take men of mature age, whohave already acq u required  experience in other walks of life ?Our opinion is, that, as a generalBitter to imin   rule, it is decidedly best to traintZ^r/mflZ   vou&quot;8 men-   Without laying toomher p/roftutom   much stress on the experience whicha long official life necessarily bringswith it, we cannot but regard it as an advantage ofsome importance. In many offices, moreover, it isfound that the superior docility of young men rendersit much easier to make valuable public servants ofthem, than of those more advanced in life. This maynot be the case in the higher class of offices, but isunquestionably so in those where the work consistschiefly of account business. The maintenance of discipline is also easier under such circumstances, and regular habits may be enforced, which it would bedifficult to impose for the first time upon older men.To these advantages must be added the important one of being able, by proper regulations, to secure theservices of fit persons on much more economicalterms. A young man who has not made trial of anyother profession will be induced to enter that of theCivil Service by a much more moderate remunerationthan would suffice to attract him a few years laterfrom the pursuit of one in which he had overcome thefirst difficulties and begun to achieve success; while to attempt to fill the ranks of the Civil Service withthose who had failed elsewhere, and were on that account willing to accept a moderate salary, wouldbe simply to bring it into discredit. It cannot be doubted that, even in the absence of proper pre-cautions for securing good appointments, it is moreprobable that a fair proportion of eligible men willbe found among a number taken at their entranceinto life, particularly if pains be bestowed upon themafter their appointment, than among an equal number taken after some years of unsuccessful efforts to open another line for themselves. The temptation to jobbing, and the danger of decidedly improperappointments being made, is also considerably lessin the case of the selection of young men than in thatof persons more advanced in life.The general principle, then, whichwe advocate is, that the public       Principle on service should be carried on by the   J^J/Jfadmission into its lower ranks of a &apos;rfcruiifdcarefully selected body of young men,who should be employed from the first upon worksuited to their capacities and their education, andshould be made constantly to feel that their pro-motion and future prospects depend entirely on theindustry and ability with which they discharge their duties, that with average abilities and reasonableapplication they may look forward confidently to acertain provision for their lives, that with superiorpowers they may rationally hope to attain to thehighest prizes in the Service, while if they provedecidedly incompetent, or incurably indolent, theymust expect to be removed from it.The first step towards carryingthis principle  into effect Should be     Examination andthe establishment of a proper system Probationof examination before appointment,which should be followed, as at present, by a short period of probation.  The necessity of this has been so far admitted that some kind of examination doesnow take place before clerks are admitted into any of the following      Examination,offices : The Treasury, the Colo-       already heldnial Office, the Board of Trade, the privy Council Office, the Poor Law Board, the WarOffice, the Ordnance Office, the Audit Office, the5
Paymaster GeneraPs Office, the Inland RevenueOffice, the Emigration Office and some others.These examinations vary in their character ; in someoffices more is required than in others, and in somecases what is required will he more rigidly enforcedby one set of Examiners than by another.The preliminary examination oftiii&apos; for a candidates for civil employment,e&apos;i!iw)&apos;7vwm &quot;i however, cannot be conducted in antxamimaion effective and consistent mannerthroughout the Service, while it is left to each department to determine the nature ofthe examination and to examine the candidates.Some on whom the duty of examining devolves feelno interest in the subject ; others although disposed to do their best, are likely to entertain erroneous orimperfect conceptions of the standard of examinationwhich ought to be fixed, and to be unable to apply itproperly after it has been settled. The time and attention of the superior officers arc fully occupied in disposing of the current business of their respective departments. To do this in a creditable mannerwill always be their primary object ; and as the bearing of the subject under consideration upon theefficiency of their departments, although very im-portant, is not of a direct or immediate kind, and isnot likely to have much effect during their owntenure of office, what has to be done in reference toit will either be done by themselves in a hurried andimperfect manner, or will be left by them to theirsubordinate officers to be dealt with at their dis-cretion. In a large department, in which numerouscandidates have to be examined, want of time will prevent the superior officers from giving the subject the attention it deserves ; and other matters, althoughof infinitely less real consequence, will have theprecedence, because they press, and must be dis-posed of at the moment. Moreover, a large pro-portion of the persons appointed to a public depart-ment usually consists of young men in whose successthe heads of the office or the principle clerks take alively personal interest, owing to relationship or some other motive connected with their public or private position ; and an independent opinion is hardly to be expected from an examiner who is acting under the orders of the one, and is in habitsof daily intercourse with the other. A publicofficer ought not to be placed in a situation in whichduty might require him to make an unfavourablereport under such circumstances. Lastly, even sup-posing every other circumstance to be favourable, itis impossible that each department, acting for itself,can come to such just conclusions in regard to thenature of the preliminary examination, or canconduct it in such a fair, and effective, and con-sistent manner, as would persons having the advant-age of a general view of the subject as it affects everypublic department, and who should have been selected for the duty on account of their experience in matters of this description.We accordingly recommend thatExaminer&quot;&apos;&apos;&quot;1&quot;f a centra^ Boarci should be consti-t&apos;c&quot;mmended tuted for conducting the examinationof all candidates for the publicservice whom it may be thought right to subject tosuch a test.  Such board should be composed of menholding an independent position, and capable ofcommanding general confidence ; it should ha- at its head an officer of the rank of Privy Coun&apos; :and should cither include, or have the means ofobtaining the assistance of, persons experienced inthe education of the youth of the upper and middleclasses, and persons who arc familiar with theconduct of official business. It should be madeimperative upon candidates for admission to anyappointment, (except in certain special cases whichwill presently be noticed), to pass a proper cxarnina-tion before the Board, and obtain from them acertificate of having done so.We  are  of opinion   that  this examination should be in all cases a      Nawn of ihrcompeting    literary    examination.       &quot;&quot;^&quot;&quot;ifiinnThis ought not to exclude careful ihould heprevious inquiry into the age, health, introduced and moral fitness of the candidates.Where character and bodily activity are chieflyrequired, more comparatively, will depend uponthe testimony of those to whom the candidate iswell known ; but the selection from among the candidates who have satisfied these preliminaryinquiries should still be made by a competingexamination. This may be so conducted as to testthe intelligence, as well as the mere attainments ofthe candidates. We see no other mode by which(in the case of inferior no less than of superior offices)the double object can be attained of selecting thefittest person, and of avoiding the evils of patronage.For the superior situations endeavours should bemade to secure the services of the most promisingyoung men of the day, by a competing examinationon a level with the highest description of education in this country. In this class of situations there isno limit to the demands which may ultimately bemade upon the abilities of those who, entering themsimply as junior clerks, gradually rise to the highestposts in them. To obtain first-rate men, it isobvious that recourse should be had to competition.It would be impossible to impose upon each can-didate for a clerkship, as a positive test of his fitnessfor the appointment, the necessity of passing an examination equal to that of first-class men at the universities; but if, on the occurrence of a vacancy,it is found that a number of candidates present them-selves, of whom some are capable of passing such an examination, there can be no reason why the public should not have the benefit of such men&apos;s services,in preference to those of persons of inferior merit.It may be repeated that no other means can be devised of avoiding the evils of patronage, which, if,in this case, less objectionable because of the com-paratively small number of superior appointments,is much more objectionable in its effects on thepublic business of the country.Our proposal is not inconsistent with the appropriation of special ...talents or attainments to special ItiJd^Zdepartments of the public service, conducted as toIn the case, for example, of the sub- ,pe&apos;e&apos;ai&quot;attatH-ordinate grades from which col- **&quot;&apos;* ******** falectors, surveyors, secretaries, junior   braidm &quot;/&quot;Xcommissioners, and other superiorofficers of the Revenue departesatepublic service
are usually selected, the nature of the examinationshr&apos;M be adapted to the object of securing thesc./ iic and other attainments which are so im-poriant to the efficiency of these great nationalestablishments. In the same way provision mightbe made for securing the peculiar attainments to berequired of persons to be employed in the ForeignOffice, and in the diplomatic and consular services;and in respect to offices of account, arithmetic andbook-keeping will be principally insisted on.It   next   becomes   a   question,riir enmpniiion   whether the competition which wehr f&quot;&apos;    nnve ProPoscd should take place onwpoiiiimaits      the occasion of each vacancy, orwhether there should be periodicalexaminations. We are of opinion that it would bedesirable to adopt the latter alternative. There arepeculiar advantages in a system of periodical exam-inations. It economises the number, and also thetime of the examiners, who, instead of being over-worked half the year, have their employmentregularly distributed. It is alsoMode in Kiihh more convenient to the candidatesperiodical themselves.  We propose, therefore,may be turned to    that examinations should be held atstated times : that an average havingbeen taken of the number of situa-tions of the class contended for, which periodicallyfall vacant, it should be announced, before the com-mencement of each trial, how many gentlemen wereto be elected for admission into the public service onthat occasion. The election having taken place,those who have succeeded should be distributed among the offices to which appointments are to bemade, on the footing of probationers. The precisemode in which the successful candidates should be allotted to the several departments will require some consideration, but there will be no difficulty in it which may not easily be overcome. One obviouscourse of proceeding would be to send to each department a list of those who arc selected forappointments, leaving to the head of each office to choose from among them as vacancies occur. Or itmight be thought desirable that the Board ofExaminers should recommend particular men to particular departments, according to their capacities,the head of the department in each case exercisinghis discretion in accepting them or not ; or the choice might be given to the candidates themselves,some restriction being imposed to prevent any fromchoosing offices for which their peculiar educationhad not fitted them. If more have been elected (inorder to maintain the average) than there is imme-diate demand for, they should be sent as super-numerary clerks to the offices in which the workhappens to be the heaviest, unless there is anyspecial service upon which they can with advantage be temporarily employed, or they might wait to take their turn. As vacancies occur from time to time before the next general examination, the super-numeraries should be appointed to them, and, if thewhole have not been placed before that time, it will only be necessary to make the nextProbation to be batch the smaller. It would beretained desirable to retain the probation asat present, rendering it more efficientby precise reports of the conduct of the probationers.In the examinations which we have recommended, we consider that the ..     ,,right of competing should be open examination into all persons, of a given age, subject &quot;i&quot;n &quot;&apos; &quot;!&apos;only, as before suggested, to thenecessity of their giving satisfactory references to persons able to speak to their moral conduct and character, and of producing medical certificates tothe effect that they have no bodily infirmity likely toincapacitate them for the public service. It is only by throwing the examinations entirely open that wccan hope to attract the proper class of candidates.The choice of the subjects to becomprehended in the examination, as siMm of thewell as the mode in which the exam- examinationination should be conducted, so asto diminish the labour by eliminating such can-candidates as have obviously no chance of success,should, of course, he left to the Board of Examiners.We will therefore only indicate the advantage ofmaking the subjects as numerous as may be foundpracticable, so as to secure the greatest and mostvaried amount of talent for the public service. men whose services would be highly valuable to thecountry might easily be beaten by some who weretheir inferiors, if the examination were confined to afew subjects to which the latter had devoted theirexclusive attention ; but if an extensive range weregiven, the superiority of the best would become evident. Besides, an opportunity would be affordedfor judging in what kind of situation each is likelyto be most useful ; and we need hardly allude to theimportant effect which would be produced upon thegeneral education of the country, if proficiency inhistory, jurisprudence, political economy, modernlanguages, political and physical geography, andother matters, besides the staple of classics andmathematics, were made directly conducive to thesuccess of young men desirous of entering into thepublic service. Such an inducement would prob-ably do more to quicken the progress of ourUniversities, for instance, than any legislativemeasures that could be adopted.It would probably be right to include in the examination some exercises directly bearing uponofficial business ; to require a precis to be made of a set of papers, or a letter to be written under givencircumstances ; but the great advantage to be ex-pected from the examinations would be, that theywould elicit young men of general ability, which is amatter of more moment than their being possessed of any special requirements. Men capable ofdistinguishing themselves in any of the subjects wehave named, and thereby affording a proof that theireducation has not been lost upon them, wouldprobably make themselves useful wherever theymight be placed. We have before us the testimonyof an eminent public officer, who was for many yearsconnected with one of the chief departments of theState.  He writes thus: &quot; During my long acquaintance with the-  Office, I remember four, and only four, instances of young men being introduced into it on the ground of well-ascertained fitness.I do not venture to mention any names, but I7
0   %3confidently affirm that the superiority of thosefour gentlemen to all the rest was such as toextort the acknowledgment of it from theirrivals, and to win the high applause of eachsuccessive Secretary of State.&quot;We feel satisfied that by the measures which wchave suggested for ascertaining the fitness of eachperson before his appointment, the most marked and important improvement may be introduced into thepublic service.We must remark that there will be,    ., .    some cases in which examination willCasts In which \    . ..    , ,       , , ,   ,rxaminathn win not be applicable. It would bemi he applicable   absurd to impose this test uponpersons selected to fill the appoint-ments which have been previously spoken of underthe name of staff appointments (see p. 4), on accountof their acknowledged eminence in one of the liberalprofessions, or in some other walk of life. Wethink, however, that the circumstances under which any person is appointed to such an office should always be placed on record by an official correspon-dence between the department to which he isassigned and the Board of Examiners ; and wewould also suggest for consideration the expediency of making an annual return to Parliament of the names of persons who may be so appointed.In dealing with the lower class ofne examination appointments, it will be necessary todasio/ rna&apos;ce provision against the difficultyanointments that if the examinations were all should he local   held at one place, a large proportionof those who might reasonably be-come candidates would be deterred from presentingthemselves by the expense of the journey. If thescheme of examinations were more favourable toone locality than another, there can be no doubt that itwould soon be set aside as unjust. We propose,therefore, that an arrangement should be made for holding examinations in various parts of the UnitedKingdom. A staff of assistant examiners might be formed ; or the services of competent men might been gaged from time to time, or recourse might be hadto the machinery of the Education Department ofthe Privy Council, for the purpose of holding districtexaminations at stated periods. Due notice shouldbe given of the times and places at which suchexaminations are to be held, and all persons intend-ing to compete should be required to send in their names by a certain day. The examinations should all take place on the same day the examinationpapers being sent to each locality by the same post,as is done in the examinations conducted by theEducation Department; and the papers, with thework of the candidates, being returned to theCentral Board, which would cause them to be examined in the manner adopted at the privy council Office&apos;1&apos;.  The required number should then* As the process adopted by the Education Department of the privy Council may not be generally known, it is well to state that the papers of the candidates in all parts of the country are sent to theCentral Office, where they ere sorted according to subjects, and sentto different Inspectors, e.g., all the papers in Arithmetic to one, all inHistory to another, and so forth. Each Inspector assigns a numberof marks to each paper, according to its merit. The papers are thenreturned; those of each candidate are put together again ; the totalnumber of marks which he has obtained is ascertained ; and the candidates are Anally arranged according to the result of the com-psrlnoa.be selected as probationers for the various appoint-ments to be filled. The precise arrangement&apos;&quot; ;ll,however, require much consideration, and we ofopinion that they cannot properly be determinedotherwise than by experience, such as the proposedBoard of Examiners, acting in concert with theChiefs of the several Departments, would speedilyacquire. We have satisfied ourselves, by communi-cations with persons whose official position enables them to form sound opinions on the subject, that therewill be no formidable difficulty in making thenecessary arrangements to meet the vast majority ofcases. Mr. John Wood, the Chairman of the Boardof Inland Revenue, has, as far as he was able, actedon these principles in the selection of Excisemen ;and the experiment has succeeded in a manner whichis highly encouraging to further attempts in the samedirection.A suggestion to bestow a pro-portion of the inferior appointments    nr first proposal in the public service upon the Pupils      &quot;^&quot;^f^in Schools connected with the Privy competitionCouncil, was made by the Govern- co&quot;&apos;ffnmen&apos;%ment of Lord John Russell in 1846, lord Johnand a Minute was passed by the is**Education   Committee   upon   thesubject.   No effect having been given to this minute, it was repealed by the Education Com-mittee, under Lord Derby&apos;s Government, as beinginoperative.It is obvious that no mere Minute of a Com-mittee of Privy Council could give effect to such ascheme unless taken up as a part of the generalpolicy of the Government.With regard to the age of ad-mission, we are of opinion that in 4,, nithe case of candidates for superior          admissionsituations the limits should, as ageneral rule, be 19 and 25 ; in the case of candidates for inferior offices, 17 and 21.Having thus completed our sug-suggestions as to the best mode of      Best mode ofobtaining a proper supply of public   mmntuinint? the.   -    .iT  c   x -    I , ctticiencv of anservants in the first instance, we have &apos;  officenext to offer some remarks on whatappears to us to be the best mode of regulating their employment, and their promotion, so as to maintainthe efficiency of the Office at the highest point.As we have already spoken of theimportance of establishing a proper separation ofdistinction between intellectual and ^&quot;&quot;^&quot;&quot;/^&quot;^mechanical labour, we need offer no m&quot; taiolrfurther observations on this mostvital point. The proper maintenance of suchdistinction depends more upon the discretion and management of the chiefs of offices and thoseimmediately below them, than upon any generalregulations that could be made by a central authority.We consider that a great step has been taken by theappointment in several offices of a class of supple-mentary clerks, receiving uniform salaries in each department, and capable therefore of being trans-ferred, without inconvenience, from one to another,according as the demand for their services may be greater or less at any particular time ; and wc expect that the movable character of this class of officers.8
and, the superior standard of examination which wch; &quot;Proposed for the higher class, will together havethe &apos;..ect of marking the distinction between them ina proper manner.We are aware that a measure hasQutaiiim oi a sometimes been recommended,ww*w which, if adopted, would have theeffect of establishing to a certain extent the separation which we have spoken of;we mean the creation of a general copying office,common to the whole or most of the departments inthe neighbourhood of Whitehall, at which all ofthem might get their copying work done at a certainrate of payment by the piece.We are, however, not prepared to\tea\lirv ital recommend the adoption of such amvmmeiiJtJ      measure.   Copying is not the onlywork of a mechanical, or nearlymechanical, character which is performed in thepublic offices. A great deal of work of various kinds, such as registering, posting accounts, keepingdiaries, and so forth, may very well be done bysupplementary clerks of an inferior class under thedirection of a small number of superiors. such work, however, could not be sent out of the office ;and even with regard to copying, it would be foundthat several offices, which would be included in theproposed arrangements, would object to sending out a large proportion of their letters for that purpose,and that a great deal of copying is done in bookswhich could not conveniently be parted with.Hence, it would be necessary, even were the copyingoffice established, to maintain a class of supple-mentary clerks in each office in addition to it, or else the clerks would be employed nearly in the same manner as at present, that is to say, without a properdistinction between intellectual and mechanicalduties.Another point to which the atten-Tramfer of tion of the chiefs of offices should befomtmeruio&quot;&apos; ca&quot;e^ iS&apos; tne importance of trans-ferring the clerks from one depart-ment of the office to another, so that each may have an opportunity of making himselfmaster of the whole of the business before he is called upon, in due course of time, to take a leadingposition. A proper system of transfers according tofixed rules in each office, and insured by periodical reports to the chief, must exercise a beneficialinfluence both upon the clerks themselves, and uponthe general efficiency of the establishment. period-cal reports upon the manner in which each clerk hasbeen employed, should be made to the chief of theoffice.The advance of salaries in thepromotions ami public service is regulated upon a&apos;sa!ar&quot;SCOJ twofold principle. Each man, on being appointed to a clerkship in aparticular class, receives for the first year, and in some cases for the first two or threeyears, what is called the minimum salary of thatclass, after which his salary increases, by a certainannual increment to what is called the maximumsalary, that is to say, if the minimum be  100 a year,the maximum  300 and the annual increment  15,the clerk receives  100 in the first year,  115 in thesecond,  1.10 in the third and so on till his salaryreaches  300 at which point it must remain stationaryunless he is promoted to a higher class. He may,however, at any time, whether before or after attain-ing the maximum salary of one class, be promoted toa higher on the occurrence of a vacancy, if he isconsidered deserving of such promotion and he will immediately thereupon begin to receive the minimumsalary of the higher class, and to advance therefromby annual increments, without reference to theamount he was previously receiving. The theory ofthe public service is, that the annual increase of salary from the minimum to the maximum of the class, is given as matter of course as the reward ofservice, and with no reference to the comparativemerits of the individuals ; but that promotion fromclass to class is the reward of merit, or rather that itis regulated by a consideration of the public interests,and that those only arc to be transferred from one class to a higher who have shown themselves capableof rendering valuable services in it. This salutaryprinciple is, however, in practice often overlooked,and promotion from class to class, as well as theannual rise within the class, is more commonlyregulated by seniority than by merit. The evilconsequences of this are too obvious to requirelengthened comment; it is, perhaps, more im-portant to point out some of the difficulties which he in the way of amendment.if the opinions of the gentlemenengaged in the Civil Service could be objectionstaken on the subject of promotion, enunaUudit would probably be found that a promotion byvery large majority of them would m&quot;uobject strongly to what is calledpromotion by merit. The reason they wouldassign would be, that promotion by (so called) meritwould usually become promotion by favouritism.The effect of the system of departmental patronagehas been to inspire the clerks in each office with a feeling of jealousy towards any one who is supposed to enjoy the especial favour of the chief of thedepartment, or, still more, of the principle perman-ent officer in it. Constituted as our official systemnow is, men feel, and not unreasonably, that the recognition of their merits, even within their owndepartments, is extremely uncertain, and that thereis no appeal to any public tribunal if injustice is donethem there. Even in an open profession a con-consciousness of unrecognised merit will sometimesweigh a man down, though he has always the hopethat the justice which is denied him in one quarterwill be done to him in another. In an office, if aclerk fails to please hi? immediate superior, he isprobably condemned to obscurity for his whole life.The Parliamentary chief who presides over thedepartment for a few years, and who is overwhelmedwith business, can as a general rule, know nothing of the merits of individual clerks in the lower ranks of the office, except through the permanent officers at its head. Now, setting aside cases of actualfavouritism, there must be many instances in whichthe chief permanent officers fail to perceive, and properly to bring into notice, the valuable qualities of those beneath them. A man may be timid andhesitating in manner, and on that account may be9
passed over as dull, in favour of someone by nomeans his superior in real worth, but having moreaddress in recommending himself, or, on the otherbaud, the chief officer may have taken a particularfancy to some young man on his first entrance intothe department, and may have thrown in his wayspecial opportunities of advancing himself, whichothers have not had. All such cases are watchedwith jealousy even now, and if promotion byseniority were wholly set aside, without the intro-duction or proper safeguards, they would be thecause of still more discomfort.It ought, therefore, to be a leading,,   , . object with the Government so as toresiding ii reguiate promotion by merit as to proposed provide   every   possible   security against its abuse; and for thispurpose we are of opinion that the following system should be adopted : On the occurrence of a vacancyin any class, the Chief Clerk, or other immediatelysuperior officer, should furnish the Secretary of thedepartment with a return of the names of a certainnumber (in no case less than three) of the Clerks atthe head of the class below, accompanied by aspecial report upon the services and qualifications ofeach. In case there should be in the lower ranks ofthe class any man of merit decidedly superior tothose above him, his name, with a note of hisqualifications should be added. The secretary should make what remarks he thinks proper uponthe list, and should then submit it to the Head of theOffice, who should select the person to be promoted,and should make out and sign a warrant for his pro-motion, setting forth the grounds upon which it ismade. A Book should be kept in every office, inwhich should be entered the name and age of eachClerk or other officer, at the time of his appoint-ment, the dates of his examination, first appoint-ment, and subsequent promotions, together withnotes of all the reports made upon him from time totime, either on the occasions afforded by the occurrence of vacancies, or at other times, in con-sequence of some special instance either of good orill behaviour. A reference to this book on theoccasion of promoting to vacancies will enable theHead of the Department to form a tolerably correctestimate of the merits of each individual. It may be noticed that such a book is kept, with very good results, in the Commissariat Department.With regard to the annual increaseAnnual increase of salary, we are of opinion that it of salary to be would be right to require that eachcertificate clerk, before becoming entitled toreceive the addition, should produce a certificate from his immediate superior, that he hasbeen punctual in his attendance, and has givensatisfaction in the discharge of his duties, during thepreceding year. Such certificates are required fromthe heads of rooms in the Ordnance Department,and from each Inspector in the Audit Office. Theywould ordinarily be given as a matter of course, butthe knowledge that they might be withheld would be useful in maintaining discipline, and in enforcingregularity of attendance, which in some cases is amatter of difficulty, the only penalties which can atpresent be imposed for irregularity being those of suspension and dismissal, which are too severe to beapplied unless in aggravated instances. ;The subject of pensions andretired allowances is one intimately Superannuationconnected with the matters treated J^TJ^gjjJof in this paper. We arc aware that and honoraryit is receiving separate consideration itiiuwiiomfrom the Government, and we there-fore abstain from entering upon it so fully as weshould otherwise have done. We desire, however,to call attention to the importance of establishing a uniform and consistent system of regulating theamounts to be granted to superannuated public servants, with reference to the character of their service. Whatever decision may be taken as to themaintenance of the superannuation deductions, orof the present scale of retired allowances, we presumethat the course now followed in the Treasury, ofapportioning the pension of each individual withsome reference to the character he has borne and theabilities he has displayed, will still be pursued.As, however, the Superannuation Committee in theTreasury changes with every change in the Adminis-tration, and as no systematic record of the merits ofpublic servants is kept at the Offices to which theyare attached, the application of the principle, whichhas been rightly laid down, is attended with much difficulty, and with an amount of uncertainty whichdeprives it of much of its value.The want of encouragement in the form of goodservice pensions and honorary distinctions, is alsoseverely felt in the ordinary Civil branch of thepublic service, which is the only one in which these classes of reward are not dispensed.It is obvious that the proposed Board of Exam-ners might be turned to good account in supplyingthese defects. Duplicates of the books which wehave recommended to be kept in the separate Officesshould be transmitted to the Department of Exam-ination, which should also be furnished with all information relating to promotions and other mattersbeing on the services of the officers in each depart-ment. No grant of superannuation allowance orgood service pension should be made by theTreasury without a previous report from the Boardof Examiners embodying this information.By this system, not only would greater certainty beintroduced into the superannuation business, but a degree of consistency would be given to the whole scheme of promotion by merit, which would, wethink, ensure its success. It v/ould also have this further advantage, that it would serve to direct theattention of the Government to the merits of individual clerks now seldom known beyond the sphere of their own offices and would thus enable it to select deserving persons from the ranks of thepublic service to fill important situations whichmight become vacant. It is to be hoped that infuture, if any staff appointment falls vacant in an office in which there is a deserving clerk well qualified to fill it, his claims will not be passed over in favourof a stranger; but this principle might advantage-ously be carried further, by filling the appointmentwith a person from another office, if there is no one in the department itself qualified to take it; andSO
there might often be occasions in which the advant-ages of encouraging public servants, and at the sametir &quot;traducing fresh blood into an office, mightbe combined ; as, for instance, by filling a staffappointment in office A by the transfer to it of ameritorious staff officer from office B, and thensupplying the vacancy caused in office B by theappointment to it of one of the most deserving clerksin office A. The extent to which this principlecould be carried into effect must, of course, depend upon circumstances, and upon a careful observationof its working; but we do not see why it shouldnot be tried.Upon a review of the recom-arv of our   mendations contained in this papermonmemia-&quot;&quot;&apos;   it will be seen that the objects whichHons we have principally in view arethese : I. To provide, by a proper system of examination,for the supply of the public service with a thoroughlyefficient class of men.2. To encourage industry and foster merit, byteaching all public servants to look forward topromotion according to their deserts, and to expect the highest prizes in the service if they can qualifythemselves for them.3. To mitigate the evils which result from thefragmentary character of the Service, and to intro-duce into it some elements of unity, by placing thefirst appointments upon a uniform footing, opening the way to the promotion of public officers to staffappointments in other departments than their own,and introducing into the lower ranks a body of men(the supplementary clerks) whose services may bemade available at any time in any office whatever.It remains for us to express our conviction that ifany change of the importance of those which wehave recommended is to be carried into effect, it canonly be successfully clone through the medium of an act of Parliament. The existing system is supportedby long usage and powerful interests ; and were any government to introduce material alterations into it, in consequence of their own convictions, without taking the precaution to give thosealterations the force of law, it is N . .almost certain that they would be y aci&quot;o&quot;imperceptibly, or perhaps avowedly, Parliamentabandoned by their successors, ifthey were not even allowed to fall into disuse by thevery Government which had originated them. Afew clauses would accomplish all that is proposed inthis paper, and it is our firm belief that a candidstatement of the grounds of the measure wouldinsure its success and popularity in the country, andwould remove many misconceptions which arenow prejudicial to the public service.STAFFORD H.

2o      THE MACAULAY REPORTSCOPY of the Report, dated November 1831, from the Committee who were requested to take into Consideration the Subject of the Examination of candidates for the Civil Service of the East India Company ; and,Copy of the Letter addressed on the 20th November 1854, by the Presi-dent of the Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India, to the Chairman,and Deputy Chairman of the East India Company, as to the Company^College at Hailkybury.REPORT on the INDIAN CIVIL SERVICE.TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE Silt CHARLES WOOD, BART., M. P.,Sec.   &amp;c.   &amp;c.Sir,We have attentively considered the subject about which you have done us the honour to consult us ; and we now venture to submit to you the result of.our deliberations.We do not think that we can more conveniently arrange the suggestions which we wish to offer than by following the order which is observed in the39th and 40th clauses of the India Act of 1853.The first matter concerning which the Board of Control is empowered by the39th clause to make regulations is, the age of the persons who are to be.admitted into the college at Haileybury.The present rule is, that no person can be admitted under 17, and that no person can go out to India after 23. Every student must pass four terms,,that is to say, two years at the college. Consequently, none can be. admittedafter 21.It seems to us that it would be a great improvement to allow students to he admitted to the college up to the age of 23, and to fix 25 as the latest age atwhich they can go out to India in the civil service. It is undoubtedlydesirable that the civil servant of the Company should enter on his dutieswhile still young; but it is also desirable that he should have received the best,the most liberal, the most finished education that his native country affords.Such an education has been proved by experience to be the best preparation for every calling which requires the exercise of the higher powers of the mind;nor will it be easy to show that such preparation is less desirable in the caseof a civil servant of the East India Company than in the ease of a professionalman who remains in England. Indeed, in the case of the civil servant of theCompany n good general education is even more desirable than in the case ofthe English professional man; for the duties even of a very young servant ofthe Company are more important than those which ordinarily fall to the lot of a professional man in England. In England, too, a professional man may,while engaged in active business, continue to improve his mind by means of reading and of conversation. But the servant of the Company is oftenstationed, during a large part of his life, at a great distance from libraries andfrom European society, and will therefore find it peculiarly difficult to supplyby study in his mature years the deficiencies of his early training.The change which we propose will have one practical effect, to which we attach much importance. We think it desirable that a considerable number oftlie civil servants of the Company should be men who have taken the firstdegree in arts at Oxford or Cambridge. At present the line is drawn jus if ithad been expressly meant to exclude bachelors of those universities. It will,we believe, be found that the great majority of our academic youth graduatetoo late by a few months, and only by a few months, for admission intoHaileybury.We propose to fix 18 as the lowest age at which a candidate can be admitted into the college. We are indeed of opinion that, except in very rare andextraordinary cases, it is not desirable that a lad should be admitted so early as 18. But we are convinced that, except in very rare and extraordinarycases, no lad of 18 will have any chance of being admitted.   Hitherto theadmissions
admissions have been given by favour. They are henceforward to be gained by superiority in an intellectual competition. While they were given byfavour, they were frequently, indeed generally, given to persons whose age wasnot much above the minimum. A director would naturally wish his son or hisnephew to be handsomely provided for at 19 rather than at 2.&apos;J, and to be ableto return to England with a competence at 44 rather than at 48. A majorityof the students have, therefore, been admitted before they were If), and have gone out before they were 21. But it ia plain that, in any intellectual oompe-tition, hoys of 18 must be borne down by men of 21 and 22. We may there-fore, we believe, safely predict that nine-tenths of those who are admitted tothe college under the new system will be older than nine tenths of those whoquit it under the present system. We. hope and believe that among thesuccessful competitors will frequently he young men who have obtained thehighest honours of Oxford and Cambridge. To many such young men afellowship, or a tutorship, which must be held on condition of celibacy, willappear less attractive than a situation which enables the person who holds it tomany at an early age.The India Act next empowers the Board of Control to determine the qualifi-cations of the candidates for admission to Haileybury. It seems to us to be proper that every person who intends to be a candidate should, at least six weeks before the examination, notify his intention to the Board of Control,and should at the same time transmit a list of the subjects in which he pro-poses to be examined, in order that there may be time to provide a sufficient number of examiners in each department. He should, at the same timv, lay before the Board testimonials certifying that his moral character is good.Whether the testimonials be or be not satisfactory is a point which we conceivemay safely be left to the determination of the Board.The Board is then authorised by the Act to make regulations prescribingthe branches of knowledge in which the candidates for admission to Haileyburyshall he examined. Here arises at once a question of the gravest importance.Ought the examination to be confined to those branches of knowledge towhich it is desirable that English gentlemen who mean to remain at homeshould pay some attention r or ought it to extend to branches of knowledgewhich arc useful to n servant of the East India Company, but useless, or almostuseless, to a person whose life is to be passed in Europe?Our opinion is, that the examination ought to he confined to those branchesof knowledge to which it is desirable that English gentlemen who mean toremain at home should pay some attention.it is with much diffidence that we venture to predict the effect of the new system; but we think that we can hardly he mistaken in believing that theintroduction of that system will be an event, scarcely less important to thiscountry than to India. The educated youth of the United Kingdom are hence-forth to be invited to engage in a competition in which about 40 prizes will, onan average, he gained every year. Every one of these prizes is nothing less than an honourable social position, and a comfortable independence for life. It isdiliieuh to estimate the effect which the prospect of prizes so numerous and soattractive will produce. We are, however, familiar with some facts which mayassist our conjectures. At Trinity College, the largest and wealthiest of the col-leges of Cambridge, about four fellowships are given annually by competition.These fellowships can be held only on condition of celibacy, and the. incomederived from them is a very moderate onc^for a single man. It is notorious thatthe examinations for Trinity fellowships have, directly and indirectly, done muchto give a direction to the studies of Cambridge and of all the numerous schoolswhich j-re the. feeders of Cambridge. What, then, is likely to be the effect of acompetition for prizes which will be ten times as numerous as the Trinity fellow-ships, and of which each will be more valuable than a Trinity fellowship? Wcare inclined to think that the examinations for situations in the civil service ofthe East India Company will produce an effect which will be felt in every seat oflearning throughout the realm,&apos;at Oxford and Cambridge, at the University ofLondon and the University of Durham, at Edinburgh and Glasgow, at Dublin,at Cork, and at Belfast. The number of candidates will doubtless be muchgreater than the number of vacancies. It will not surprise us if the ordinarynumber examined should be three or four hundred. The great majority, and among them many young men of excellent abilities and laudable industry, mustbe unsuccessful. (If, therefore, branches of knowledge specially Oriental should34- B
be among the subjects of examination, it is probable that a considerable numberof the most hopeful youths in the country will be induced to waste much time,at that period of life at which time is most precious, in studies which will never,in any conceivable case, be of the smallest use to them. We think it most desirable that the examination should be of hmoIi a nature that no candidatewho may fail shall, to whatever calling he may betake himself, have any reasonto regret the time and labour which he spent in preparing himself to be examined.Nor do we think that we should render any service to India by inducing her future rulers to neglect, in their earlier years, European literature and science,for studies specially Indian. We believe that men who have been engaged^ upto one or two and twenty, in studies which have no immediate connexion withthe business of any profession, and of which the effect is merely to open, toinvigorate, and to enrich the mind,&apos; will generally be found, in the business ofevery profession, superior to men who have;, at 18 or 1!), devoted themselves tothe special studies of their calling. The most illustrious English jurists havebeen men who have never opened *a law book till after the close of a distin-distinguished academical career ; nor is there any reason to believe that thev wouldhave been greater lawyers if they had passed in drawing pleas and conveyancesthe time which they gave to Thueydides, to Cicero, and to Newton.&quot; Theduties of a civil servant of fhe East India Company are of so high a nature thatin his case jt is peculiarly desirable that an excellent general education, suchas may enlarge and strengthen his understanding, should precede the specialeducation which must qualify him to despatch the business of his cutchcriy.It therefore seems to us quite clear that those vernacular Indian languageswhich are of no value except for the purpose of communicating with natives ofIndia, ought not to be subjects of examination. But we are inclined, though with much distrust of our own judgment, to think that a distinction mav nro-perly be made between the vernacular languages, and two languages which mavbe called the classical languages of India, the Sanscrit and the Arabic. Theseclassical languages are by no means without intrinsic value in the eyes 30th ofphilologists and of men of taste.. The Sanscrit is the great parent stock fromwhich most of the vernacular languages of India are derived, and stands tothem in a relation similar to that in winch the Latin stands to the French, theItalian, the Spanish, and the Portuguese. The Arabic has contributed, though not in the same degree with the Sanscrit, to the formation of the vocabulariesof India; and it is the source from which all the Mahometan nations draw their religion, their jurisprudence, and their science. These two languages arealready studied by a few young men at the great English seats of learning.They can be learned as well here as in the East; and they are not likely to be studied in the East unless some attention has been paid to them here. It will,we apprehend, very seldom happen that a candidate will offer himself for examination in Sanscrit or in Arabic; but, as such instances may occur, wethink it expedient to include those languages in the list of subjects.As to the other subjects we speak with more confidence. Foremost among those subjects we place our own language and literature. One or more themesfor English composition ought to be proposed. Two papers of questions oughtto be set. One of those papers should be so framed as to enable the candidatesto show their knowledge of the history and, constitution of our country : theother ought to be so framed as to enable them to show the extent of their knowledge of our poets, wits, and philosophers.In the two great ancient languages there ought to be an examination notless severe than- those examinations by which the highest classical distinctionsare awarded at Oxford and Cambridge. At least three passages from Latinwriters ought to be set, to be translated into English. Subjects should be proposed for original composition, both in Latin verse and in Latin prose; andpassages of English verse and prose should be set, to be turned into Latin.At least six passages from Greek writers should be set, to be translated intoEnglish. Ot these passages, one should be taken from the Homeric poems,one from some historian of the best age, one from some philosopher of the bestage, one from some Attic orator, and at least one from the Attic drama. the candidates ought to have a full opportunity of exhibiting their skill in trans-luting both English prose and English verse into Greek; and there should bea paper of questions which would enable them to show their knowledge ofancient history, both political and literary.We
We think that three of the modern languages of the Continent, the. French,the Italian; and the German, ought to be among the subjects of examination.Several passages in every one of those languages should be set, to he turnedinto English j passages taken from English writers should be set. to be turnedinto French, Italian, and German ; and papers of questions should be framedwhich would enable a candidate to show his knowledge of the, civil and literaryhistory of France, Italy, and Germany.The examination in pure and mixed mathematics ought to be of sucha nature as to enable the. judges to place in proper order all the candidates,from those, who have never gone beyond Euelid&apos;s Elements and the first part of algebra up to those who possess the highest acquirements. Wethink it important, however, that not only the acquirements, but also the mental powers and resources of the competitors should be brought to the test.With this view the examination papers should contain a due proportion oforiginal problems, and of questions calculated to ascertain whether the principlesof malhematieal science are thoroughly understood. The details will probablybe lx m arranged by some of those eminent men who have lately been moderatorsin I lie University of Cambridge, and who know by experience how to conduct the examinations of large numbers of persons simultaneously. It must,however, be borne in mind that the extent and direction of mathematicalreading, especially in the higher branches, differ greatly at the differentuniversities of the United Kingdom. The mathematical examination for theIndian service must, therefore, in order to do justice to all candidates, embracea wider range of questions than.is usual at Cambridge, Oxford, or Dublin.Of late years some natural sciences which do not fall under the. head ofmixed mathematics, and especially chemistry, geology, mineralogy, botany, andzoology, have been introduced as a part of general education into several ofour universities and colleges. There may be some practical difficulty in arranging the details of an examination in these sciences ; but it is a difficulty which has, we believe, been at some seats of learning already overcome. Wehave, no hesitation in recommending that there should be at least one paper of questions relating to these branches of knowledge.We. propose to include the moral sciences in the scheme of examination.Those sciences are, it. is well known, much studied both at Oxford and at theScottish universities. Whether this study shall have to do with mere words or with things, whether it shall degenerate into a formal and scholastic pedantry,or shall (rain the mind for the highest purposes of active life, will depend, togreat extent, on the way in which the examination is conducted. We are ofopinion that the examination should be conducted in the freest manner, thatmere, technicalities should be avoided, and that the candidate should not be confined to any particular system. The subjects which fall under this headare the elements of moral and political philosophy, the history of the ancientand modern schools of moral and political philosophy, the science of logic, andthe inductive method, of which the Nbvum Qrganum is the great text-book.The object of the examiners should be rather to put to the. test the, candidate^powers of mind than to ascertain the extent of his metaphysical reading.The whole examination ougft, we think, to be carried on b^ means of writtenpapers. The candidates ought not to be allowed the help of any book ; norought they, after once a subject for composition *has been proposed to them, ora paper of questions placed before them,- to leave the place of examination till the)&apos; have finished their work.It is, of course, not to be expected, that any man of 22 will have, made considerable proficiency in all the subjects of examination. An excellentmathematician will often have little Greek, and an excellent Greek scholar willbe entirely ignorant of French and Italian. Nothing can be further from ourwish than to hold out premiums for knowledge of wide surface and of smalldepth. We are. of opinion that a candidate ought to be allowed no credit at all for taking up a subject in. which he is a mere smatterer. Profound andaccurate acquaintance with a single language ought to tell more than badtranslations and themes in six languages. A single paper which shows that the writer thoroughly understands the principles of the differential calculus oughtto tell more than 20 superficial and incorrect answers to questions aboutchemistry, botany, mineralogy, metaphysics, logic and English history.It will he, necessary that a certain number of marks should be assigned to each subject, and that the place of a candidate should be determined by the34- d a sum
sum totul v)f the marks which he lias gained. The marks ought, we conceive,to be distributed among the subjects of examination, in sueli a manner that no part of the kingdom, and no class of schools, shall exclusively furnish servants to the East India Company. It would be grossly unjust, for example, to thegreat academical institutions of England^ not to allow skill in Greek and Latinversification to have a considerable share in determining the issue of the corn-petition. Skill in Greek and Latin versification has indeed no direct tendency to form a judge, a financier, or a diplomatist. But the youth who does bestwhat all the ablest and most ambitious youths about him are tr) ing to do wellwill generally prove a superior man ; nor can we doubt that an accomplish-ment by which Fox and Canning, Grenville and Wclleslcy, Mansfield andTcntcrden, first distinguished themselves above their fellows, indicates powersof mind, which, properly trained and directed, may do great service.&apos; to theState. On the otlaer hand, we must remember that, in the north of this islandthe art of metrical composition in the ancient languages is very little cultivated,and that men so eminent as Dugald Stewart, Homer, Jeffrey, and Mackintosh,would probably have been quite unable to write, a good copy of Latin alcaios, orto translate 10 lines of Shakspeare into Greek iambics. We wish to see such asystem of examination established as shall not exclude from the service of tin-East India Company either,a Mackintosh or aTenterden, either a Canning or aHomer. We have, with an anxious desire to deal fairly by all parts of theUnited Kingdom, and by all places of liberal education, framed the followingscale, which wc venture to submit for your consideration :English language and literature :Composition -	-	-   500History -		-   500General literature	-	-   500		1,500Greek   -	m                  m                                       -	-    &apos; -      -   750Latin	-	-  750French -	-	-   375German -	-	-   375Italian&quot; -	-	-   375Mathematics, pure	and mixed -	- 1,000Natural sciences	-	-   500Moral sciences		-   500Sanscrit		-   375Arabic -	-	-   375		0,875It seems to us probable, that of the 6,875 marks, which are the maximum,no candidate will ever obtain half. A candidate who is at once a distinguishedclassical scholar and a distinguished mathematician will be, as he ought to be,certain of success. A classical scholar who is no mathematician, or a mathe-matician who is no classical scholar, will be certain of success, if he is well readin the history and literature of his own country, A young man who hasscarcely any knowledge of mathematics, little Latin and no Greek, may passsuch an examination in English, French, Italian, German, geology, and chemistry,that he may stand at the head of the list.It can scarcely he necessary for us to add, that no expense ought to begrudged which may be necessary to secure the services of the ablest examinersin every branch of learning. Experience justifies us in pronouncing with entireconfidence that, if the examiners be well chosen, it is utterly impossible thatthe delusive show of knowledge which is the effect of the process popularlycalled cramming can ever be successful against real learning and ability.Whether the examinations ought to be held half-yearly or annually is aquestion which cannot, we think, be satisfactorily determined till after the firstexperiment has been made.When the result of the examination has been declared, the successful candi-dates will not yet be civil servants of the East India Company, but only civilservants elect.   It appears from the 40th clause of the Act to be the intention* of
ol the Legislature thnt, before they proceed to the East, there should be a periodof probation and a second examination.In what studies, then, ought the period of probation to be passed? and what might to ho the nature, of the second examination?It si (ins to us that, from the moment at which the successful candidates,whom w will now call probationers, have been set apart as persons who will,in nil probability, have to bear a part in the government of India, they should,give their whole minds to the duties of their new position. They must now beriiiiMilerrd as having finished their general education, and as having finished it with honour. Their serious studies must henceforth be such as have a specialtendency to fit them for their calling.Of the special knowledge which a civil servant of the Company ought to pos-scss, much can be acquired only in India, and much may be acquired far morecasilv in India than in England. It would evidently be a mere waste of time to employ a month here in learning what may be better learned in a week at Cal-cutta or Madras. But there are some kinds of knowledge which are not con-sidered as essential parts of the liberal education of our youth, but which it is most important that a civil servant of the Company should possess, and which he may acquire in England not less easily, indeed more easily, than in India.We conceive that every probationer ought during the interval between his first and his second examination to apply himself vigorously to the acquiring ofthese kinds of knowledge.The subjects of his new studies will, we apprehend, be found to range them-solvts under four heads.lie should, in the first place, make himself well acquainted with the historyof India, in the largest sense of the word history. He should study that history,not merely in the works of Orme, of Wilks, and of Mill, but also in the travelsof Ilernier, in the odes of Sir William Jones, and in the journals of Heber. Heshould be well informed ab^ut the geography of the country, about its naturalproductions, about its manufactures, about the physical and moral qualities ofthe different races which inhabit it, and about the doctrines and rites of thosereligions which have so powerful an influence on the population. He shouldtrace with peculiar care the progress of the British power. He should under-siand the constitution cf our Government, and the nature of the relationsbetween that Government and its vassals, Mussulman, Mahratta, and Rajpoot,lie should consult the most important Parliamentary reports and debates on indian affairs. All this may be done with very much greater facility in Englandthan in any part of India, except at the three seats of Government, if indeed thetltree scats of Government ought to be excepted.Secondly, it seems to us to be desirable that every probationer should bestowsome attention on the general principles of jurisprudence. The great majorityof the civil servants of the East India Company are employed in the administra-tion of justice. A large proportion of them are judges; and some of the mostimportant functions of the collectors are strictly judicial. That the generaljuiiieipli s of jurisprudence may be studied here with more advantage than inIndia with he universally acknowledged.&apos;1 lordly, we think that every probationer ought to prepare himself for thedi.M-harge of his duties by paying some attention to financial and commercial-en nee. He should understand the mode of keeping and checking accounts,the principles of banking, the&quot; laws which regulate the exchanges, the nature ofpublic debts, funded and unfunded, and the effect produced by different systems?of taxation on the prosperity, of nations. We would by no means require himto subscribe any article of faith touching any controverted point in the scienceof political economy ; but it is not too much to expect that he will make himselfacquainted with those treatises on political economy which have becomertaiKiard works. These studies can undoubtedly be prosecuted with more^haiitago in England than in India.loiirthly, we think that the study of the vernacular languages of India maygiyai advantage be begun in England.   It is, indeed, only by intercourseJ,  1 &quot;&quot;&apos; &quot;il,iv(! population that an Englishman can acquire the power of talking&quot;   :.*b&apos;&apos;&apos; or Telugu with fluency.   But familiarity with the Bengalee or Telugu;4 Oj&apos;i 11, skill in tracing the Bengalee or Telugu character, and knowledge of!,&quot;&apos;. &quot;        &quot;r Tolugu grammar, may be acquired as quickly in this country&quot;&apos;!&apos;&apos; 1   l,;isl*  Nay, we are inclined to believe that an English Btudent will, atj b 3 his
&quot;7 &quot;Z P*CJ W \JMs first introduction to an Indian language, make more rapid progress undergood English teachers than under pundits, to whom he is often unible to explainhis difficulties. We are therefore of opinion that evnry probationer nhouldacquire in this country an elementary knowledge of at least one Indian language.If this recommendation he adopted, it will he desirable that the probationersshould, immediately after the first examination, be distributed among the i&apos;re-sidencies. It will indeed bo desirable that the division of the Bengal civilservice into two parts, one destined for the upper and the. other for the lowerprovinces, should be made here at the earliest possible moment, instead of beingmade, as it now is, at Calcutta.In what manner the distribution of civil servants among the Presidenciesought henceforth to be made is a question winch, though it has not been referredto us, is yet so closely connected with the questions which have, been referredto us, that we have been forced to take it into consideration. We are disposed to think that it might be advisable to allow the probationers, according to theorder in which they stand at the first examination, to choose their Presidencies.The only objection to this arrangement is, that, as the Presidency of Bengal isgenerally supposed to be the theatre on which the abilities of a civil servantmay be most advantageously displayed, all the most distinguished young men would choose Bengal, and would leave Madras and Bombay to those who stood at the bottom of the list. We admit that this would be an evil; but it wouldbe an evil which must, we conceive, speedily cure itself; for as soon as it-becomes notorious that the ablest men in the civil service are all collected inone part of India, and are there stopping each other&apos;s way, a probationer whois free to make his choice will prefer some other part of India, where, thoughthe prizes may be a little less attractive, the competition will be much lessformidable. If, however, it should be thought inexpedient to allow the pro-bationers to choose their own Presidencies in the manner which we havesuggested, it seems to us that the best course would be to make the distributionby lot. We are satisfied that, if the distribution be made arbitrarily, either bythe Directors or by Her Majesty&apos;s Minister for Indian Affairs, it will be viewedwith much suspicion, and will excite much murmuring. At present nobodycomplains of the distribution. A gentleman who has obtained a Bombaywritership for his son is delighted and than kful. It may not be quite so aocept-able as a Bengal writership would have been : but it is a free gift; it is a most valuable favour ; and it would be the most odious ingratitude to repine because it is not more valuable still. Henceforth an appointment to the civil serviceof the Company will be not matter of favour, but matter of right. He whoobtains such an appointment will owe it solely to his own abilities and industry.If, therefore, the Court of Directors or the Board of Control should send himto Bombay when he wishes to be sent to Bengal, and should send to Bengalyoung men who in the examination stood far below him, he will naturally thinkhimself injured. His family and friends will espouse his quarrel. A cry willbe raised, that one man is favoured because he is related to the Chairman, andanother because he is befriended by a Member of Parliament who votes withthe Government. It seems to us, therefore, advisable that the distribution ofthe civil servants among the Presidencies, if it cannot be made the means ofrewarding merit, should be left to chance. After the allotment, of course, any two probationers should be at liberty to make an exchange by consent.But, in whatever manner the distribution may be made, it ought to be madeas soon as the issue of the first examination is decided; for, till the distributionis made, it will be impossible for any probationer to know what vernacularlanguage of India it would be most expedient for him to study. The Hindos-assistance , indeed, will be valuable to him, wherever he may be stationed; but noother living language is spoken over one-third of India. Tamul would be asuseless in Bengal, and Bengalee would be as useless at Agra, as Welsh in Portugal.We should recommend that every probationer, for whatever Presidency hemay be destined, should be permitted to choose Hindostanee as the language inwhich he will pass. A probationer who is to reside in the lower provinces of the Bengal Presidency should be allowed to choose either Hindostanee orBengalee. A probationer who is to go to the upper provinces should be allowedto choose among Ilindostanee, Hindee, and Persian. A probationer who is togo to Madras should be allowed to choose among Hindostanee, Telugu, andTamul. A probationer who is to go to Bombay should be allowed to chooseamong Hindostanee, Mahrattee, and Guzeratee.It
It is probable that some probationers who have a peculiar talent for learningnnguages will study more than one of the dialects among which they are allowed to make, their choice. Indeed it is not improbable that some who take an interest in philology will apply themselves voluntarily to the Sanscrit and theArabic. It will hereafter be seen that, though we require as the indispensablecondition of passing only an elementary knowledge of one of the vernacularton-rues of India, we propose to give encouragement to those students whoaspire to be eminent Orientalists.The four studies, then, to which, in our opinion, the probationers ought to devote themselves during the period of probation, are, first, Indian history ;secondly, the science of jurisprudence; thirdly, commercial and financialscience; and fourthly, the Oriental tongues.The time of probation ought not, we think, to be less than one year, normore than two years.There should be periodical examinations, at which a probationer of a year&apos;sstanding may pass, if he can, and at which every probationer of two years&apos;standing must pass, on pain of forfeiting his appointment. This examination should, of course, be in the four branches of knowledge already mentioned asthose to which the attention of the probationers ought to be specially directed.Marks should be assigned to the different subjects, as at the first examination ;and it seems to us reasonable that an equal number of marks should be assigned to all the four subjects, on the supposition that each probationer is examined in only one of the vernacular languages of India. Sometimes, however, as wehave said, a probationer may study more than one of these vernacular languagesof India among which he is at liberty to make his choice, or may, in additionto one or more of the vernacular languages of India, learn Sanscrit or Arabic.Wc think it reasonable that to every language in which he offers himself for examination an equal number of marks should be assigned.When the marks have been cast up, the probationers who have been examinedpIhuiM be arranged in order of merit. All those who have been two years pro-h(iii&apos;iiMTs. and who have, in the opinion of the examiners, used their time well,and made a respectable proficiency, should he declared civil servants of theCompany. Kvcrv probationer who, having been a probationer only one year,ha- obtained a higher place than some of the two-year men who have passed,should also be declared a civil servant of the. Company. All the civil servantswho pass in one year should take rank in the sendee according to their places in the final examination. Thus a salutary emulation will be kept up to the last moment. It ought to he observed, that the precedency which we propose togive to merit will not be merely honorary, but will be attended by very solidadvantages. It is in order of seniority that the members of the civil servicesucceed to those annuities to which they are all looking forward,and it may dependon the manner in which a young man acquits himself at his final examination,whether he shall remain in India till he is past 50, or ahall be able to return toKngland at 47 or 48.The instances in which persons who have been successful in the first exami-nation will fail in the final examination, will, we hope and believe, be very few.M e hope and believe, also, that it will very rarely be necessary to expel any pro-bat practitioner from the service on account of grossly profligate habits, or of any actionunbecoming a man of honour. The probationers will be young men superior to their fellows in science and literature; and it is not among young mensuperior to their fellows in science and literature that scandalous immorality isgenerally found to prevail. It is notoriously not, once in 20 years that a studentwho has attained high academical distinction is expelled from Oxford or Cam-bridge. Indeed early superiority in science and literature generally indicatesthe existence of some qualities which are securities against vice,-industry, self-denial, a taste for pleasures not sensual, a laudable desire of honourable distinc-tiou, a still more laudable desire to obtain the approbation of friends and rela-tions. Wc therefore believe that the intellectual test which is about to beestablished will be found in practice to be also the best moral test that can be one important question still remains to be considered. Where are the proba-turners to study ? Are they all to study at I-Iaileybury? Is it to be left to them-jj-lvt. s to decide whether they will study at Haileybury or elsewhere? Or will theHoard of Control reserve to itself the power of determining which of them shallHuily ut llaileybury, and which of them shall be at liberty to study elsewhere r34, B 4 That
That the college, at Ilaileybury is to he kept up is clearly implied in the termsof the 37th and 30th clauses of the India Act. That the Board of Control maymake regulations which would admit into the civil service persons who havenot studied at Ilaileybury is as clearly implied in the terms of the 40th and 41stclauses. Whether the law ought to he altered is a question on which we do notpresume to give any opinion. On the supposition that the law is to remain unaltered, we venture to offer some suggestions which appear to us to be im-portant.There must be, we apprehend, a complete change in the discipline of the college. Almost all the present students are under 20; almost all the new studentswill he above 21. The present, students have gone to Ilaileybury from schoolswhere they have been treated as hoys. The new students will generally gothither from Universities, where they have been accustomed to enjoy the liberty of men. - It will therefore be absolutely necessary that the regulations of the college should be altered, and that the probationers should be. subject to no more severe restraint than is imposed on a bachelor of arts at Cambridge or Oxford.There must be an extensive change even in the buildings of the college. Atpresent, each student has a single small chamber, which is at once his parlourand bedroom. It will be impossible to expect men of two or three and twentv,who have long been accustomed to be lodged in a very different manner, to be content with such accommodation.There must be a great change in the system of study. At present, the studentsgenerally go to Haileybury before they have completed their general education.Their general education and their special education, therefore, go on together.Henceforth, the students must be considered as men whose general education has been finished, and finished with great success. Greek, Latin, and mathe-inatics will no longer be parts of the course of study. The whole education willbe special, and ought, in some departments, to be of a different kind from thatwhich has hitherto been given.We are far, indeed, from wishing to detract from the merit of those pro-fessors, all of them highly respectable and some of them most eminent, whohave taught law and political economy at Haileybury. Hut it is evident that acourse of lectures on law or political economy given to boys of 18, who havebeen selected merely by favour, must be a very different thing from a course oflectures on&apos;law or political economy given to men of 23, who have been selectedon account of their superior abilities and attainments. As respects law, indeed,we doubt whether the most skilful instructor will be able at Haileybury toimpart to his pupils that kind of knowledge which it is most desirable that theyshould acquire. Some at least of the probationers ought, we conceive, notmerely to attend lectures, and to read well-chosen books on jurisprudence, butto see the actual working of the machinery by which justice is administered.They ought to hear legal questions, in which great principles are involved,argtied by the ablest counsel, and decided by the highest courts in the realm.They ought to draw up reports of the arguments both of the advocates and ofthe judges. They ought to attend both civil and criminal trials, and to takenotes of the evidence, and of the discussions and decisions respecting theevidence. It might be particularly desirable that they should attend the sittings of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council when important appeals from india are under the consideration of that tribunal. A probationer,, while thusemployed, should regularly submit his notes of arguments and of evidence tohis legal instructor for correction. Such a training as this would, we are inclined to think, be an excellent preparation for official life in India; and we mustleave it to the Board of Control to consider whether any plan can be devised bywhich such a training can be made compatible with residence at Haileybury.We have, &amp;c.(signed)      T.

Gentlemen, India Board, 30 November J854.I have the honour to enclose to you, for the information of the Court of directors of the East India Company, a copy of the Report which has been drawn up by the gentlemen who nt my request have been kind enough to give me their valuable, assistance in the consideration of the best mode of carryinginto effect that part of the Act of 1853 for the government of India which provides that the public admissions to the civil service of the East India Com-pany shall be by competition.I concur in the general tenor of their Report.

In this question is involved the continued maintenanceof the College of Haileybury.Upon the best consideration which I have been able to give to the subject,this college, as it is now constituted for the education of youths from the age of]/, appears to me to be altogether unsuited to the instruction of gentlemen,many of whom may have passed through the full course of education at one orother of the universities, and some of whom may perhaps have even enteredupon their studies for the bar.Nor does it appear to me that any change in the constitution of Haileyburywould render it possible that gentlemen residing there would have the oppor-tunity of acquiring the knowledge which it is most desirable that all the civilservants of the East India Company should possess.No qualification is so necessary to them, whether they be employed in thejudicial branch of the service or in the combined duties of collectors and magis-tratcs in India, as a thorough knowledge of the principles of law, combined witha practical acquaintance with the mode of conducting civil and criminal suits.Nothing, in my opinion, can conduce so much to the acquisition of this prac-tieal knowledge as attendance during the progress of trials in courts of justice ;and the opportunity of doing this is so much greater in the metropolis thanelsewhere, that this circumstance alone would render London by far the most convenient place for their residence. It seems to me also that arrangements may he. made in London more easily than elsewhere for their instruction in theother branches of knowledge, of which they ought to have some acquaintance,in order to enable them to discharge with efficiency the multifarious duties which are so often thrown upon the civil service in India.I have, come to the conclusion, therefore, that it is inexpedient permanentlyto maintain Ilaileybury College. It will be necessary, however, that it shouldcontinue in a state of efficiency so long as is requisite, in order to educate thosegentlemen who have been nominated to vacancies which occurred previous tothe :iuth of April last.

IMPRESSIONS OF THE CIVIL SERVICES INFRANCE, SWEDEN AND THE UNITED states in the course of our work a numher of us paid visits to france  and Sweden,    and two of us to the United States.     We wishto record our deep appreciation of the kindness which our hostsshowed to us and of the great trouble they took to make ourvisits fruitful.     We append below accounts     of the impressionswe carried away from each of these visits.   but three main ideas particularly struck us.2o    First, in both France and Sweden we were struck by the youth of civil servants in the key positions nearest to Ministers.The size and complexity of the U.S. Civil Service made itimpossible to attempt.a comparison there.     But the French and swedish systems are constructed in their different ways to providesenior policy-making posts for young men.     The directeur ducabinet in France is the Minister&apos;s principal collaborator in policy matters and also plays a part in the control of theMinistry.     The Under Secretary in Sweden is also the Minister&apos;a chief adviser on policy and is the senior official in a smallMinistry whose function is that of a policy-making secretariatlargely free of executive responsibility.     Men in their 40sand even 30s are commonly appointed to these posts.     The averageage of directeurs du cabinet is h6;    of Under Secretaries, 1+5*Neither post has an exact equivalent in Britain, but the averageage of Permanent Secretaries, whose functions include that ofbeing top policy adviser, is 56.3o     Secondly, in all three countries, the extent to which ministers choose their own immediate staff.k.    Thirdly, the professionalism of high civil servants.     It is achieved in different ways:    in France by selecting and trainingelites, in Sweden and the U.S.A. by each department recruiting itsown men for specific kinds of jobs.     However achieved, the result was impressive in each of the three countries.
annex the FREJNCH CIVIL service the Chairman, Sir James Dunnett, Dr. Hunt, Sir Norman Kipping,Mr. Neild and the Assistant Secretary visited Prance from 7th to10th Novemher, 1966.     This note sums up their main impressions.Pro f e s s i on a 1 i sm2.     We were much impressed by the quality of the men in theimportant, central jobs.      They were lucid, expert and possessed ofthat confidence which comes from the achievement of highresponsibility combined with a certainty that one knows one&apos;ssubject as well or &quot;better than anyone else.j.     It is a remarkable achievement to have created two complement-ary elites on the technical and administrative sides - thepolytechniciens and the products of the Ecole Nationaled&apos;Administration (E.N.A.).     Each is a highly selected and highly trained breed.     Yet because the polytechnicien&apos;s training iswidened so as to include economics and managerial disciplines, thetwo elites have common ground on which they can meet.     Both seemwell equipped to assume responsibility for policy-making, the assessment of projects and the other tasks of the higher civil servant.k*     These qualities owe much to the systems of selection andtraining;    and something also to the fact that the higher civilservice is an attractive route to the top of French life both inthe public and private sectors.5.     We were struck too by the fact that the men in positions of very high responsibility are often remarkably young compared totheir British counterparts.     Clearly, there are good arrangementsfor picking out promising young men;    the system of ministerialcabinets plays a large part in it.      It appears to be wellaccepted that a young man should be put into a central post close to Ministers and should later move away from the centre to take charge of a job of a more managerial character within a Ministry
or great organ of state like the Gonseil dVgtat or outside theCivil Service.      The existence of these outlets to reward the older men makes possible the turnover in the central positionsthat&apos;   affords opportunities to bring forward the younger men.Elites6.     The French Civil Service is extremely elitist, and there isan elaborate hierarchy of elites;    there is a recognised order ofprecedence in esteem and standing for the different corps andMinistries.7,     On the administrative side, the highest status belongs tothe grand corps - Conseil d&apos;Etat, Inspection-General des Finances,Cours des Comptes.     Apart from their own primary functions, theyare an elite deployed throughout the Civil Service and elsewhere.At any time about a third to a half of&apos; their members may beemployed in posts outside the corps, and there is also asubstantial amount of part-time duties outside the corps.     Thejobs on which they are employed may be inside the Civil Service,in central posts like the Secretary-General of the Government(analogous to the Secretary of the Cabinet), in ministerialcabinets, in special directorates and commissions,  etc., or outside the Civil Service in the public, semi-public and private sectors of industry and commerce, in international organisations,etc.8.     A second elite group is the top technical corps.     As anelite, they resemble, mutatis mutandis, the administrative elite.There is a similar well-established order of precedence v.ith the corps des Mines first, the Corps des Fonts et Chaussees second,the Corps des Telecommunications third, and so on down the scale.The higher corps are general-purpose technical elites, not confined to their traditional functions as a corps, but deployed throughoutthe Service.9.     Certain Ministries are dominated by the great technical corpsand have not been popular as allocations for administrators
because their role has largely &quot;been in giving auxiliary,administrative services to technical directors.     It is, however,now an official policy to get more civil administrators from theE.M.A. into the technical Ministries and to give them moreequality of status within those Ministries.      The Ministry of equipment and Housing is perhaps an indication of the way theFrench are moving since it is a recent creation, amalgamating the ministries of Construction and Public Works.     It includes bothadministrators and members of the top technical corps, mixedtogether with no fixed proportions or relations between them;    atthe senior policy-making and managerial levels a man&apos;s job does not depend on whether his background is on the technical or theadministrative side.10.   The predominance of the elites is self-renewing:    the grandscorps get the best jobs because they are manned by the best men,and they attract the best men because they lead to the best jobs -outside the Service as well as inside.      The danger in thissystem appears to be that to the man who gets an initial advantagemore and more advantage is added;    the gap between one man andanother, perhaps only a matter of a few marks at the time ofgraduation from the E.N.A., gets continually wider.     the structure of the Service, based on the corps, hut not described at length in this note, is both fragmented and rigid.     There is little class-to-class promotion in the British sense;    the normalroute of advancement is by limited competition, demanding an exceptional effort that is scarcely feasible for the older man inparticular.TrainingEcole Rationale d1Administration11.   The E.1N.A., founded in 1945, is one of the most famousfeatures of the modern French Civil Service - in our view justly so.It carries out both recruitment and training for the higher
Civil Service.,     One hundred places a year are filled from twocompetitions, an open competition for two-thirds of  the places, andone limited to existing civil servants for the remaining third.The competition includes written, oral and physical tests.      the subjects are political, economic and social history from the middleof the 18th. Century, political economy, political institutions,French administration, modern languages, and physical training;the optional subjects include mathematics, statistics and science.Although part of the examination is oral, it does not include a general interview in the British style designed for the assessment of the character and personality, as distinct from the abilities,of candidates, and no attempt to evaluate such qualities is made inmarking and selection.     This is of course in striking contrast toBritish practice in the Civil Service and other employment, butthis practice is regarded as alien to French ideas.      One seniorFrenchman told us that he thought that the British type ofinterview was an unfair and dishonest method of selection.12.   In order to stand a chance of success, candidates must have undertaken some special preparation beyond an ordinary degree.     Ineffect, it is necessary to undergo thorough training, tantamount to a second degree course, in the modern subjects set in thecompetition.      The limited competition covers much the same ground,hut in principle more emphasis is given to practical experience and the benefits derived from it, and in practice it is admitted to he rather easier.     But some special training is also necessary,and candidates are often given special leave from the Civil service for the purpose.     It appears that many candidates for the limitedcompetition are of the same type and background as those for the open competition, who enter the Civil Service with the object of finding an easier way into the E.K.A. and resign if they fail todo so.13*   Once admitted to the E.N.A., the students are salaried civilservants under service discipline.     The course begins with a year&apos;s
stages usually in a prefecture.     The student    is attached to theprefect&apos;s office as an assistant, seeing the work of the office,handling files, attending meetings etc.     He spends some time in sub-prefectures and in the local offices of the various Ministries.He is given a report to do on some suoject that is not onlyvaluable to him as a training exercise but in itself useful to theprefect;    copies are sent to the E.K.A. with the prefect&apos;scomments for assessment and markings.     At the end of the stage the prefect completes a report on the student.     The stage isregarded by administration and the students alike as a particularly profitable part of the course.1U.   The remaining eighteen months of the course are mainly spent athe E.N.A. in Paris.     There is no full-time teaching s taff.      Theinstructors are mainly themselves civil servants, with someuniversity teachers and others.     There are few formal lectures andclasses.     Most of the teaching is in discussion groups.Considerable use is made of group projects;    a study group isrequired to produce a report on some current topic, and has to collect the material by visiting Ministries and other organisations the main fields of study are judicial and administrative matters,economic studies, international relations and social questions.Statistics, public accountancy, business management, and organisation and methods are also included in the syllabus, andthe students are expected to improve their practical grasp of their first foreign language and to acquire the elements of a second.The content of the course is under constant review to keep it upto date.     Everyone does the same subjects, including those going into the Diplomatic Service (and indeed it is not known forcertain who they, are until the end of the course).     Members ofthe Diplomatic Service therefore get a grounding in economicsand other subjects, while members of the Home Civil Service get agrounding in international questions.     Each has a means of
communication with the other.     Thus the course at the E.N.A. isnot broken down according to the specialisms that students willpursue as civil servants.     Until 1958 it was divided into foursections specialising in administration, economics, social affairs and international questions, hut since the practice of determining allocations to c orps and to Ministries by the finalorder of merit was already followed, there was no necessaryrelation between the specialism a man pursued and his allocation.15.   Towards the end of a course there is a second stage of about two months, the stage d&apos;entreprise, spent in a private firm, some ofthem quite small.      The firms are asked to give the students realwork and responsibility, hut one may have doubts as to the extentto which that is practicable in two months.      Our impression i6that at present the stage d&apos;entreprise is not regarded as oneof the more important parts of the course.16.   Marks are awarded throughout the course, and determine a finalorder of merit which is announced at the end of the course.     Atthe same time a list is published of the vacancies available in theCivil Service, equal in number to the student&apos;s graduating.     Thestudent with top marks has first choice of all the availablevacancies and so on down to the student with bottom marks who hasno choice and takes the last vacancy left.     The high degree ofpredictability of the students&apos;  choices has already been mentioned.Those at the top opt for the Conseil d&apos;Etat and the Inspection-Qenerale des Finances, followed by the Cours des Conrptes and so onthrough the various Ministries in order of standing.     Thissystem is justified in official French quarters on two grounds,first, as ensuring objectivity of allocation, and, secondly, as a necessary means of getting continued effort from the students,in view of the fact that once admitted to the E.N.A. they are in theCivil Service and virtually certain of getting at least a decentjob.     It is admitted that as a consequence there is degree ofcompetitive tension that is sometimes unhealthy.
X7,   In European countries, where administration has a formal andjuridical character, Civil Services traditionally have been manned by people educated in subjects proper to administration as a formal art;    frequently by lawyers.      (in contract, british administration has been informal ana pragmatic, and a formaleducation in administration was not required.)     The achievement of the French Civil Service with the E.N.A.,  imitated in varying degrees by some other European countries, is to have broken away from the traditional mould and created a vocational education for a modern Civil Service.     Administration remains an importantsubject at the E.I\.A. because French administration still has a formal and juridical framework but it is combined with the outward-looking disciplines relevant to the work of a Civil service with a positive role in a modern society.Ecole Polytechnique18.   The Ecole Polytechnique carries out training for the highertechnical corps of the Civil Service, and also for the armed forces, research and the private sector.      There are about 300places a year, preparation for which is   done      in special classes in higher mathematics and special mathematics at about thirteenlycees.     The competition consists of written, oral and physicaltests, in mathematics, physics, chemistry.   French composition,general education, a foreign language and physical training.19.   In the two-year course a larger element of formal lecturesurvives than at the E.N.A., probably because of the subjectstaught, but nevertheless they only amount to a small proportionof the course.     The rest of the time is taken up with seminars,individual and group projects based on real problems, and freestudy.     The syllabus is the same for all students, consisting of courses in mathematics, mechanics,, physics and chemistry and someinstruction in the humanities, economics and a modern language.Again, marks are given throughout which go to make up the finalorder of merit at the end of the two years.
20.   The graduates of the Ecole Polytechnique do not all becomecivil servants.     Some become army oificers or military engineers.A number go into research.     About 100 resign from the publicservice and go into the private sector;    the option may be left open until the allocation of places following the finalclassification, and many resign from the public service if they arenot well enough placed to get into the top corps of their choice.A former student of the Polytechnique who leaves the public servicewithin ten years of graduation must pay a forfait, a substantialsum;   however, industrial firms are very willing to bear thecharge in order to get a polytechnic!en.    There remain about 80 whogo into one of the civilian engineering corps, of which there isa great variety fxamimines to meteorology, weights and measures totelecommunications.     As already described, there is, especially at the higher level, a hierarchy of preceaence between thesecorps.     As at the E.K.A., allocation is made by the graduatesthemselves according to their final classification.21.   The polytechnicien who goes into a state engineering corpsmust go through the appropriate ecole d&apos;application - anapplied training school.     Each technical Ministry runs its ownschools to provide specialised training for its own staff and the associated industry.     These schools take in direct entrants fromlycees by competitive examination, as well as graduates of thePolytechnique9 but for the most part it is the latter who go intothe higher echelons while the direct exitrants man the lowertechnical corps or go into private industry.     The Ecole des Minesranks highest among these schools.     Ten or twelve of the bestgraduates from the Poly technique enter annually, together with50-70 direct entrants, but the direct entrants are not members of the corps des Mines and have little chance of getting into it.     Theschool has gone a long way from its original role of getting a8pecialised training in mining engineering.     The three-yearsyllabus not only includes scientific, engineering and technicalsubjects, but also a year in industry as an engineer with
production responsibilities, the study and solution on a team\ basis of a real business problem using a computer, and thedevelopment of economic, adminiLtrative and financial understanding,including study in depth of an actual technico-economic problem from one of the MiniLtries.     At the end of the course, the former olytechnicien is a member of the corps and he may go into thestate service in one of the Ministries or be detached to work ina nationalised industry or other public corporation.      He may alsogo into private industry for a spell without necessarily severinghis connection with the Civil Service, the test being hisreadiness to return if recalled;    in effect there is a steadyerosion of members of the technical corps to the private sector.This occurs in spite of the fact that the most successful areamong the most highly-paid French civil servants, and indicates that they are a much sought-after elite.Ministers and departments22.   French Ministries do not have a Permanent Secretary.     In afew Ministries, notably the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there isthe post of Secretary-General but in practice it is not a realequivalent.     Ministries are divided into directions, headed bydirectors, in principle equal but in practice sometimes not all of the same importance and standing.      There is also the Minister&apos;cabinet headed by the directeur du cabinet.      The role of thedirecteur du cabinet within the Ministry in relation to the directors varies considerably at different times from one ministry to another.     While the directors are responsible for administration and management within their spheres, the directeur du cabinet iespecially concerned on the Minister&apos;s behalf with the politicaldirection of the Ministry and the political implications of itspolicies and activities.     It is through him and the rest of thecabinet that the Minister exercises control over the Ministry.The directeur du cabinet is therefore the official in a FrenchMinistry who exercises some of the functions of a PermanentSecretaryj    that his appointment is made by the Minister is a very important difference.
23.   The AirfiSASMr       Cap,in,efr, is typically (but not always) apermanent civil servant, and frequently a young man of relativelyjunior rank (sub-director).     He is carefully selected;    theappointment is made by the Minister and must be approved by theprime Minister,     In the Ministry of Finance, for example, he has a staff of 25-30* including six or seven promising young men under himeach with a specific responsibility for one or more directions.The young men are usually civil servants of about the equivalentrank of Principal.     At the end of their spell in the cabinet theycan usually expect promotion.     In the case of the directeur ducabinet, this would usually be to the rank of director, that is,to a more managerial job, or alternatively he (directeurs ducabinet are often members of the grands corps) might go back intohis corns or on to some other important, special job.2k*   Ministers appear to exercise more control over the appointment and dismissal of senior staff to and from posts than in thiscountry.     There is a network through which Ministers getrecommendations and advice on the appointment of men to theircabinets and to other jobs.    It certainly seems to work as a way of bringing promising young men forward.     The staff of a cabinet are normally changed when a new Minister comes in, and a Minister may also change them at other times.      The directors of the operationaldivisions in a Ministry may also be changed by a Minister, but inpractice this happens less frequently.     In each Ministry thereis a director of personnel but he is commonly the weakest directorin the Ministry, concerned in practice only with the personnel management of the junior grades.Central management of the Civil Service25*   The central management of the French Civil Service is divided between two bodies.     The direction du budget of the Ministryof Finance is responsible for financial control.     The direction de^administration et de la fonction publlque is responsible formanagement control.     The Prime Minister is the Minister
responsible i&apos;or the civil service, but his powers in relation tothe civil service have usually been delegated to another Minister,at present the Minister of State for Administrative Reform to whomthe direction tie la fonction publique works.      The direction dealswith general policy on pay, pensions, conditions of service,manpower, recruitment, promotions, education and training,retirement, mobility, career management, management services etc.It directly supervises the career management of individuals incertain classes.     As regards the relationship between the twodirections, the direction de la fonction publique concernsitself with pay and pensions through their effect on management,while the direction du budget concerns itself with anything that can be construed to have financial implications and therefore has an interest in efficiency.     It appears that the duality of responsibility-ity works well.     The existence of an independent department forthe Civil Service has the effect in France that there is a positiveforce thinking of reforms and the interests of the service, and doing battle where necessary with the Ministry of Finance.Conclusion26,   The French system produces highly professional elites on boththe administrative and technical sides;    their professionalism ismaintained and constantly renewed by the flow of recruits who haveundergone a high-powered, modern training.     The elites areexclusive.     It is difficult to enter them from within the Serviceexcept at the start of a career;    and to do so requires intensepreparation and a particular kind of higher education.     We did notinvestigate the middle and lower levels of the Service, and cannot form a judgement on the extent to which a price has to bepaid in the quality of the Service at these levels for themethods by which the elites are produced.     But as to the quality ofthe elites themselves there is no doubt.     They offer a highlyattractive career,  so eagerly sought after that the Service canPick from the cream of the educational output.     It is an important feature of this system that elites export much talent to the upper
reaches of other employments and that the methods hy which theyare selected and trained thus effectively servie a wider purposethan the manning of the higher Civil Service itself.
,o 5 4AnnexTHE SWEDISH CIVIL service the Chairman, Mr. Anderson, Sir James Dunnett, Dr. Hunt,Sir Norman Kipping, Mr. Neild, Mr. Sheldon and the Secretaryvisited Sweden from 6th to 9th February, 1967.      This note sums up their main impressions.The main feature - the separation of Ministries and Agencies2o     The central government machine is very small.      There areeleven Ministers with a total staff of not much more than 1,500between them;    the Ministry of Education, for example, has a staffof about 120.      This is made possible by the fact that large blocks of work that would be done hy government departments in britain are entrusted to autonomous agencies in Sweden.     The agenciesinclude both commercial bodies (e.g. the Telecommunications Board)whose functions are similar to those of nationalised industries in Britain, and non-commercial bodies such as the National SchoolsBoard and the National Labour Market Board.3e     The main function of the Ministry is to act as the Minister&apos;ssecretariat;    the staff advise the Minister on policy and draftbriefs, speeches, parliamentary bills etc.     The execution of policylies with the agencies.     This separation enables the Minister andhis closest advisers to concentrate on policy;   and allocatesexecutive responsibility to separate public bodies, each with itsown accountable head.     It also makes possible an enviable pattern of career management.     The best young entrants to Ministriesare employed straight away on secretarial w ork of highresponsibility, rise quickly to the chief posts in the Ministry bythe time they are about forty, and then commonly go out between the ages of 1+5 and 50 to become the heads of agencies or to occupysenior positions in them.     Ministers thus have as their chiefadvisers relatively young men and women who have energy and ideas and are capable of standing up resiliently to a high pressure ofwork.     We noted that Ministries in Sweden do not have a singleofficial head but (usually) three chief officers who are more orless co-equal - the Under Secretary who deals with policy,, the
permanent Secretary who deals with administration and the ChiefLegal Officer.      The Under Secretary in particular is very close tothe Minister and is generally a semi-political appointment,[j..    The attractions of this system are great and clear.     we considered its working under two broad heads:-(a) how the Swedish separation of functions works;(b) the pattern of staffing which it produces for theSwedish Civil Service.nmthe separation of function works5,    The most striking feature of the system is that the Swedesdo not rely upon a single, monolithic organisation, like agovernment department in the United Kingdom, both to make policy andto execute-&apos; it.      The responsibility is divided &quot;between two bodies,one close to the Minister, which is small, lively and staffed forthe most part with younger men, the other with indepencent executive authority, which is larger and headed by older men with moremanagerial responsibilities.      The distinction is not a clear onebetween policy-making and execution.      Ideas come from many quarters,notably from the agencies themselves, which are regarded byParliament and the public as responsible for their own field and areexpected to be active in making policy proposals to tneir Ministries.The Ministries for their part are not absolved from all administrative work;   in particular they deal with quite a lot of case-work andappeals.     They may, within limits provided by parliamentarylegislation, give agencies direct instructions about the way inwhich they execute policy, but they may not interfere with directivespertaining to a particular case;    the handling of individual cases isthe responsibility of the agencies, subject to appeal to the ministry or to administrative courts where these are provided.     The primaryfunctions of each are thus distinct:    the Ministry&apos;s to serve theMinister in hie policy-making and legislative duties;    the agency&apos;sto run and take public responsibility for executive operations.
64    The working of this system is regulated &quot;by law and conducted in the full light of publicity.     The duties and responsibilities ofthe agencies are embodied in statutes or royal instructions.So is their structure and organisation;    as an integral part of thecivil service, agencies, including the nationalised industries,have less freedom in this respect than British nationalised industries.     The responsibilities of civil servants at all levels of the agencies are thus legally defined, and the agency civil servant is answerable to the courts for discharging t hem.     Asregards publicity, all official documents with limited exceptionsare open to public inspection.     An agency thus normally publishesthe proposals it makes to a Ministry for a new policy, and alwayspublishes its budget proposals.      The responsibility then lies withthe Ministry, which has not been consulted in advance, to acceptor reject them, and give its reasons for doing so.     Agencies thus have considerable power and influence;    and their heads, who have great security of tenure, are major public figures in theirown right.7.    This pattern of power and responsibility derives much fromthe political history and social characteristics of Sweden.     It isa relatively small (less than eight millions) and very homogeneoussociety.     There are uig controversies, but the basis of thegeneral consensus is remarkably wide.     Political stability (theSocial Democrats have been in power since 1932) means that thepermanent heads of agencies have been matched by almost equallypermanent Ministers, who know the business of their smalldepartments inside out.     The system of conducting government in public and on the basis of statute law produces a much narrowerdifference between Ministers and civil servants than in Britain;&amp; Swedish civil servant may be a member of Parliament, and it isnot thought surprising if, within certain limits, he speaks hiskind on government policy in public.
yjift^taffing^pf the Civil Service8,    The pattern of staffing that the structure producesnevertheless provides interesting comparisons with Britain,.     Oneof the nost striking features is the young, expert and influentialsecretariat in each Ministry.      Until recently these civil servantshave been predominantly lawyers by training.     Given the legal basisof Swedish administration, this was natural, and lawyers willcontinue to be needed in relatively large numbers (Ministries do agreat deal of legal drafting).      But there is now a considerable expansion in the recruitment of those with an education in politicalscience and economics.     In contrast to this country, arts graduatesin Sweden rarely look for a career in government service, and the ministries for their part generally look for recruits withqualifications broadly relevant to their future work.     It is howeverinteresting t o note that scientists and other specialists are not usually found in the Ministries;    the Ministry of Health, forexample, employs no doctors.      The National Board of Health on theother hand employs many doctors in senior administrative positions;the present Director-General is a former university professor ofmedicine.     Most Swedes thought this pattern was right;    but a minority expressed an.uneasy feeling that an important science-based approach was being missed in the Ministries and would be needed in future.9e     The able young men who rise quickly to top posts in the ministries then go out to become heads or senior officers ofimportant agencies in middle age.     Others may also be exported tobecome provincial governors or directors of minor agencies.There is thus a constant flow through the Ministry secretariat;and the civil servant who is ceasing to make his full contributionto the policy-making process moves out to posts of high executive responsibility elsewhere.     We noted that these civil servants do not receive professional management training before they move to this new kind of managerial work.     We also thought it likely that the agencies would be at some disadvantage in their efforts to recruitand retain a fair share of the best talent if their top jobs were
regularly reserved for imports irom the Ministries.     We foundhowever that most people, in agencies as well as in Ministries,were well content with the system.10.   Otherwise,  there is little movement, between Ministry andagency, between Ministries, between agencies or between the CivilService and private employment.     Relations between theprivate and public sectors, which are close, thus depend not uponmovement but upon personal acquaintance and co-operation.      the open system of government facilitates this;    notably thepractice of enlisting members of parliament from opposition parties,businessmen and trade unionists to serve on committees and the boards of agencies, and the tradition of exposing all questions for publiccomment before policy decisions are made.11,   The absence of internal movement reflects the fact that thereis no central management of the Swedish Civil Service.     A centralMinistry is in charge of pay and the Ministry of Finance contains an Organisation and Methods Office.     But no central body deals withrecruitment, postings or promotions.      Since a few years back,  some limited training is under way;    a small agency with limited resources was created in 1966 for training civil servants.     Thebenefits of this system are that Ministries and agencies canrecruit the men they need with a specific eye to the jobs to be filled, and that continuity produces a high expertise.     ministers and staff are both in their small departments for long enough toget to know each other intimately;    a Minister can thus pick hisclosest advisers in full knowledge of the field.      On the otherband, the absence of central recruitment produces competition inwhich some Ministries e.g. the Ministry of Finance, regularly securethe best talent and some agencies do not get enough;    we thought thatthe absence of central arrangements for subsequent movement would beaPt to perpetuate this unevenness.     Finally, dismissal is virtually unknown;    a civil servant, once appointed, has a job for life.
rw.luBion12,   The system of Ministries and agencies, the commanding feature of the Swedish structure, sets a high-powered and youthfulsecretariat for the Minister side by side with independentexecutive agencies within a political framework in which governmentis carried on in the open, the responsibility for innovation is widely diffused and policy-making is a matter of public debate.The staffing of the Civil Service is naturally designed to servethis system.       Its main features are separate recruitment and staff management by each Ministry and agency, and the flow of ablemen from the secretariats to the executive agencies in middle age.
annex the UNITED STATES CIVIL SERVICELord Pulton and Sir Philip Allen spent five days in washington in September 1966.     In this note they record their mainimpressions of the United States Civil Service and give a briefsummary of its structure.structure of the U.S. Civil service,    The structure of the Service is primarily governed by the classification Act of 1949 and subsequent amendments.     (the classification Act, along with other personnel statutes, has beencodified into Title V, United States Code.)     The general purposeof the Act is to provide a plan for (i) pay rates and (ii) the classification of positions.3,    As regards (i), variations in rates of pay paid to differentofficers are, under the Act, to be in proportion to substantialdifferences in the difficulty and responsibility of, and the qualification required by, the work performed and to the contribu-tions of officers to efficiency and economy in the Service.     in determining the rate of pay the principle of equal pay forsubstantially equal work is followed (i.e. within the Service -the question of comparability with outside employment is touched on in.paragraphs 10-13).4*    As regards (ii), the Act requires that individual positions, inaccordance with their duties, responsibilities and qualificationrequirements, be so grouped and identified by classes and grades,and the various classes so described in published standards, thatthe resulting position-classification system can be used in allspheres of personnel administration.     The term &quot;position&quot; is usedto mean the work assignable to a particular officer.     The term&quot;class&quot; includes all positions that are sufficiently similar, as tokind or subject matter of work, level of difficulty and responsibility, and qualification requirements of the work, to warrant similar treatment in personnel and pay administration.     The
-     361term &quot;grade&quot; includes all classes of positions that, althoughdifferent in the kind or subject matter of work, are sufficientlyequivalent, in difficulty, responsibility and the level ofqualification required, to warrant the inclusion of such classes ofpositions within one range of rates of basic pay.      In addition there are occupational groups embracing, generally, several seriesof classes or positions in associated or related occupations,professions or activities.     A single grade will include persons from many occupational groups and they will often at very different, points in their own occupational hierarchy.5,    There are 18 grades in the Classification Act GeneralSchedule, and posts are also classified by occupational groups.Thus the general administrative clerical and office services group is known as G.S.30C while the engineering and architecture group isG.S.800.     These groups are broken down into series, so thatG.S.305 is the mail and file series within the general administrative,clerical and office services group.     G.S.305-1 is the lowest levelof file clerk while file supervisors may range up to G.S.305-9 orhigher.     G.S.810 is the civil engineering series within theengineering and architecture group.     G.S.8IO-5 is the lowest gradeof civil engineer.     Civil engineers are also graded as 7 and 9 andin all the grades from 11 to 18.6*    The General Schedule includes the executive departments, theindependent establishments and agencies in the executive branch,and such bodies as the Administrative Office of the United StatesCourts, and the Government Printing Office.     It does not apply tothe Field Service of the Post Office Department, the Foreign service or industrial staff or to many of the dentists, ooctors and nurses,college and school teachers, employed by the Federal Government.Also excluded from the General Schedule are posts above the levelof G.s.18.     These are known as Federal Executive posts and areliBted in the Federal Executive Salary Act of 1964*     This Actdivides such posts into five salary levels.     With some exceptions(especially at level V) these posts are outside the career service
arid tend to be filled by the administration in power, although they include many posts in the United Kingdom which would be civilservice posts.      Most of these appointments are subject toPresidential and Senate approval.     Level I of the Federal ExecutiveSalary Schedule includes Cabinet Ministers.     Level II includes anumber of heads of agencies and officers such as the Director of the bureau of the Budget, the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commissionand some junior Ministers, but most Under Secretaries are inLevel III together w ith a number of Chairman of Boards andCommissions.     Level IV includes the 11 Assistant Secretaries ofState and a number of Assistant Secretaries in the other majorDepartments.     Level V includes a number of Heads of the moreindependent sections of the main departments and the less importantindependent Departments.     Below these senior posts covered by theFederal. Executive Salary Act are the 18 grades in the GeneralSchedule.     Details of the salaries of officers covered by theFederal Executive Salary Act and of officers induced in theGeneral Schedule are in Note 1 at the end of this annex, which also shows the numbers of officers in the various grades.li    In addition to positions under the General Schedule andthe arrangements described in the last paragraph, there are about 800,000 Federal blue-collar workers who are paid atrates determined administratively in the light of local rates.8a    Apart from G.S.18, which has a fixed salary, all other grades in the General Schedule are paid on a scale which from G.S.1 toG.S. 15 has 10 points.     Progression within a grade by means ofWithin grade increase&quot; is described in paragraph 15 below.The Civil Service Commission has issued elaborate classificationstandards indicating the kinds of positions which may be placed inthe various classes and grades on the basis of duties,responsibilities and qualifications required.     It is the concern of the agency or department, using the published standards, todetermine the class and grade of individual jobs.     If no published
-v   363itandards directly apply, agencies classify the positionsconsistently with published standards for related occupations.By periodic reviews and inspections the Commission determines ifthe agencies are correctly applying the accepted standards.     TheCommission has authority to revoke or suspend an agency1 sclassification authority if necessary.     With minor exceptions, theCommission classifies all positions in G.S.16, 17 and 18 for whichgrades no written standards have been published.9,    Two-fifths of the 1.1 million persons in G.S. positions are inG.S.3S k and 5 which contain the vast majority of clerical posts.70 per cent are in G.S.1 to 9.     A very few supervisory clericalposts are found above this level.     Only 10 per cent of the 1.1 million are in G.S.13 to 18.     According to the law describinggrades generally, G.S.1 to 3 are for different kinds of routinework of var-hing degrees of responsibility and difficulty, but not normally involving supervision.     G.S.I4.   is the first grade for whichminor supervisory experience is required and G.S.3 is the lowestgrade which works under general supervision.     G.S.5, 7 and 9 arethe levels at which recent college graduates enter.     A person with aBachelor&apos;s Degree would normally enter G.S. 5 or 7 and persons withayearfs graduate study would enter G.S.7 or 9.     Possession of adoctorate normally qualifies a person for entry to G.S.11, or in research posts G.S.12 if the person concerned holds special qualifications.     Although the levels may range from G.S.7 toG.S.13, G.S.11 and 12 may be regarded as the most common journeymanlevels for almost all professional and administrative positions.     as described by law, G.S.13 includes assistant heads of majororganisations within a department or doing comparable work underadministrative directions, with wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgement, work of unusual difficulty and responsibilityalong special technical, supervisory or administrative lines, requir-ing extended specialised, supervisory, or administrative training and experience which hag demonstrated leadership and marked attainments.
Q,Sdk includes Heads of major organisations within a Bureau.     In&quot;frpractice, hoth G.S.13 and G.S.14 include many kinds of positions,both supervisory and non-supervisory.10.   The Federal Salary Reform Acts of 1962 and 196h mademajor changes both in the levels of salaries and the means of fixing them.     For the first time the Federal Government adopted a policy of comparability with private enterprise rates for thesame level of work.     Moreover the 1962 Act reaffirmed the principleof internal alignment i.e. equal pay for substantially equal workand pay distinctions in keeping with work and performancedistinction.     This is fundamental to the Classification Act, but since World War II there had been many piecemeal pay adjustmentswhich had gradually eroded much of this concept.11*   Comparability of pay with private enterprise was establishedby the 1962 Act.     It is based on &quot;national average rates&quot; for about eighty   occupational classes, made up of salaries in abouteighty areas.     This information is collected and analysed by the bureau of Labour Statistics.     Each of these classes can be matched with a particular Classification Act grade.     From a numberof such national average rates fitting a particular grade, a&quot;grade average&quot; is determined.     This is then related to other gradeaverages and if necessary the resulting pay line covering all gracesis smoothed out to give regular progressions.     The resultingfigure for each grade is then used, as the fourth point or rate on the scale.     The survey is thus not, like our Pay Research UnitSurvey, based on a study of particular posts the results of whichare applied to particular classes, but on statistical averages whichare then applied to service-wide grades.12,   The President has to report annually to Congress a comparison of Federal and private enterprise pay rates as revealed by the analysis of the Bureau of Labour Statistics survey results.     Heis also required to include in his reports any recommendations onFederal pay or pay policy he considers advisable.     He must secure
the views of employee organisations on theseproposals.13,   Under the 1962 Act, G.S.1 to 7 were given fully comparablesalary rates in two stages and G.S.8 to 15 partially comparablerates.     The latter were increased so as to come nearer still tocomparability under the 1964 Act.     Although the 1962 Act gave an increase of salary to G.S.16, 17 and 18, it did not apply theprinciple of comparability at this level.     The Senate Committeeinstead recommended that these salaries should be reviewed inconjunction with Federal Executive salaries outside the GeneralSchedule, particularly as otherwise top civil servants would be paidmore than their chiefs in the Cabinet.     This was done tinder theI96J4. Act, but the rates for G.S.16 to 18 were based not on the bureau of Labour Statistics Survey as this does not cover staff atthis level, but on projections of the salaries of lower gradesi.e. on the principle of internal alignment rather thancomparability.     It is recognised that because of the high rates of pay at this level outside the government service full comparabilitycannot apply.lk*   The 1962 Act also established clear relationships between theGeneral Schedule and other Federal salary systems such as the PostalField Service Schedule, the Foreign Service Schedule and thoseapplying to medical staff.     Although the Bureau of LabourStatistics Survey does not cover occupations comparable withposts in these schedules the fact that they are closely linked withthe General Schedule means that changes in private enterpriserateB affect them indirectly.15*   Increments, known as &quot;within-grade increases&quot;, are notpaid on an annual basis, but are granted at varying intervalsdepending on the time spent in the grade and on performance on the3ob*    Under the 1962 Act the rule is that all grades move fromrate 1 to 2 after a year, and to rate 3 after another year.They spend two years on rates 4, 5 and 6 and three years onratea 7, 8 and 9*     This system was evolved because it is recognised
-    366that the greatest increase in work proficiency occurs during theEarliest period of service at any grade level.     But in additionagencies can grant w ithin-grade increases based on &quot;high-qualityperformance&quot; above that ordinarily found in the position concerned.Such increases cannot be given more than once a year.l6.   Recruitment is normally to the minimum salary of the grade concerned, but the 196h Act permits a rate above the minimum rate of the grade to be offered to unusually well-qualifiedcandidates for appointments to positions in grade G.S.11 or above.As the scales of G.S. grades overlap, promotees do not necessarilystart at the minimum.     They are guaranteed a pay increase at least as large as two &quot;within-grade increases&quot; in the grade from whichthey are promoted and if necessary can be paid the top rate oftheir new grade.17.   The Civil Service Commission directs the recruitment andexamination of candidates for Federal posts, most of whom enter the civil service on a permanent basis.     Agencies however decide how particular posts will be filled e.g. by promotion, transfer orrecruitment.     When an agency decides to make an original appointment,a list is passed to the agency of names of qualified persons (in orderof merit) who have passed the examination (or competition - a written test is not necessarily part of the examination).     the agency has to take one of the first three.     The Commission alsoholds examinations to fill actual or expected vacancies.     Much ofthis work of announcing examinations, rating candidates, and maintaining lists of eligibles is done throughout the country byifiter-agency boards of Civil Service examiners, operated by theCivil Service Commission.18*  Most members of the Civil Service are recruited on a permanent basis, but the career-conditional appointment system was introducedir* 1955 to give staffing flexibility during expansions andcontractions of work resulting from limited emergencies and toaeBure stability of the career service.     Career-conditionalappointees have to pass the open competitive &quot;examinations&quot; and are
..... - 367selected for posts in regular order from lists of eligibles.     After$ then they have fewer rights than the permanent staff ifredundancy occurs.     In   addition appointments to strictly temporaryjobs may he made for periods not exceeding a year.     Also if thereis no list of eligibles, conditional appointments can be made,pending the establishment of such a list.     Under a recent law,these conditional appointments may ripen into appointments with full career standing in three years.     Temporary appointments arealso made for jobs of a project nature that will be completed within four years.19,   Some impressionsAttention is drawn in this paragraph to some of the morestriking differences, in this context, between the two countries.(a) There is no sharp distinction, such as we have, betweenthe political head of a department and the top officials -between the Minister who publicly speaks on policy issues and the officials who do not.     The &quot;Minister&quot; is nota member of Congress, and may not even be a professionalpolitician.     In this country we occasionally bring inoutsiders from time to time to head departments as ministers but when we do they have to become politiciansand be provided with a parliamentary seat.(b) The separation of powers is a very real thing.The legislature has its own staff.(c) A good deal is prescribed by law in a very detailed form -for example, the total number permitted in certaingrade 16, 17 and 18 positions and salaries..     (positions in the scientific and engineering categories are notrestricted by law.)    There are those who would seeadvantage in altering the law so as to produce somethingcorresponding to the British Administrative Class butthere would be no likelihood of doing so, s ince thelegislature is firmly set against anything which tends
.....     368towards establishing an exclusive elite.     This isputting an extreme example:   hut it is a matter of history that the recommendations of the second HooverCommission for the setting up of a senior Civil service were not accepted,(d)    &quot;Agencies&quot; proliferate on a considerable scale, and theymay or may not eventually he brought together under one ministerial head - as was happening at the time of owevisit in the proposals for a new Department of transportation, which to a large extent was taking over anumber of agencies   that have so far had a more or lessindependent existence.     Nor is there always a straightforward hierarchical set-up within a department.Sometimes separate units continue to have a pretty wellself-contained existence (for example the P.B.I. and theFederal Bureau of Frisons within the Department ofJustice);    and at the Treasury, which is a much moreunified structure than some, the departmental chartshows that something like fourteen people report direct tothe Secretary to the Treasury, although in practicearrangements are made to ensure that some of thei]B$ troublehim very little.20.   This paragraph summarises some comments on the U.S. CivilService at the time of the 1966 visit.(1)   The U.S. Civil Service was an open Civil Service in thatentry could take place at many levels.     Althoughstatistically most of the higher civil servants enteredat relatively low levels, nevertheless the intake to theService direct to the higher levels, and at later ages,was on a significant scale.(2)   It was a striking feature of the Service that a number ofthe top posts (including some which in this country wouldbe filled by permanent civil servants) were filled by&quot;In-and-outers&quot; - people who come into the Government
-    369for a period of perhaps three years and then go&quot;back to private life in some form or other, to be availablehowever for some future political appointment.     Itwas still a feature of the organisation (and thiswas an unaerlying reason for the creation of the posts inSchedule C - see Ip^e tl. J that the bureaucracy should bemade politically responsive to political leadership.But it was very much an over-simplification to think ofthe U.S. system as being s imply a dual system, in whicha rather thin layer of political appointees rested on asubstantial body of civil servants.     The position was much more complicated than this.     A number of top postswere indeed filled by political appointees from outside;but there was an even greater number of &quot;politicalappointees&quot; from within the Civil Service ranks, and movement to and fro blurred the sharpness of the distinction between appointees from outside on the onehand and civil servants on the other.In the main, the highest civil servants were in the&quot;super grades&quot; (grades 16 to 18).     There were some4,1+30 of them - 394 in grade 18;    893 in grade 17;and 3,147 in grade 16.     But there were a few top civilservants to be found in &quot;level 5&quot; of the FederalExecutive appointments.     Most of the level 5 appointments(totalling 475 in all) were political appointments subjectto Presidential and Senate approval, but not all.     Theexecutive head of the Civil Service Commission - the topcivil servant there - was level 5, whereas the Chairman,a political appointee, was level 3*Some 11% of the &quot;super grade&quot; appointments, and a fewappointments above grade 18, were &quot;Schedule C&quot; posts.Quite a number of these were professional civil servantswho had gone into Schedule C at their peril.     There were
1,600 &quot;Schedule C&quot; appointments in all.     These were notstraight political appointments.     They were described as a &quot;buffer zone between the political appointee andthe professional civil servant.      Those in Schedule Cwere either personal and confidential assistants to thehead of an agency;    or advisers on policy;    or holders of posts which called for public advocacy of controversialprogrammes.     The Civil Service Commission alwayshad to approve that a particular post should be placedin Schedule C and that a particular individual nominatedfor a grade 16 - 18 post could be appointed to it - butin doing so the only test they applied was whether he had.-   the right qualifications.     Most of the 1,600 posts were&quot;confidential&quot; ones (e.g. personal secretaries) and onlya minority were &quot;policy-determining&quot; posts, but most ofthis minority was to be found in Grades 16 - 18 above.(Schedule C was however about to be abolished for thesuper grades and replaced by &quot;non-career executiveassignments&quot;.)(5)   Many persons coming into the Civil Service at the entrylevel had to take only an intelligence test (other thanspecialists,  such as doctors).      Others, such asstenographers and typists, had to take performance tests.These were organised by the Civil Service Commission.But the appointment was made by the agency.     There was an important exception to the general rule that entrantshad to take only an intelligence test:    those who wanted to come in as &quot;management interns&quot; (formerly knownas &quot;junior management assistants&quot;) had in addition totake a general knowledge test.     Recruitment of thesemanagement interns had fallen off to not much more than200 in a year, but it was hoped to get the total back to500 or 600.     No individual agency could hire one ofthese management interns unless it had a training plan
-     371for him which the Civil Service Commission had approved;and the limitation so far has &quot;been, not the lack of funds and suitable jobs in the agencies.     There was aconsiderable wastage among management interns.     A lot of them went off after a few years to jobs outside thegovernment service.The Federal Civil Service did not get enough high-quality scientists and engineers.     The Federal Governmentput out a tremendous amount of scientific and engineeringwork to the universities, without attempting to do this work within the Service.     Where the Service did wellfor recruitment was in the areas where they wereproducing expensive hardware of a kind not met withinthe private sector;    and where very large-scale equipmentwas needed as, for example, in cosmic research.      Theydid well too in the recruitment of economists, becausethe government service itself provided interesting work andcareer prospects which compared well with outside,  and,unlike the position in the physical sciences, theGovernment did not finance any big support programme inthe social sciences in the universities.One interesting development was the White House Fellowshipscheme.     This involved taking a number of people,mainly from the universities, and allocating them to jobsof personal assistant, or something like this, to peoplenear the top of the hierarchy, for a year.     The hope wasto take in about eighteen a year.     This was not so much arecruitment device as a means of spreading greaterknowledge about government among the intellectual community,although a number of those who had come in the early days of the scheme wanted to stay on in government when theiryear&apos;s fellowship was up.     This scheme was not financed from Federal funds, but by private foundations.
-.. 372(8)   Training was a responsibility of the agencies, hut theCivil Service Commission provided central courses to which members of the agencies could go - on payment by the agency.      The Commission were running short elementarycourses in management, and were also thinking of setting up some form of staff college for those in their forties.An Act had been passed in 1958 putting duties on theCivil Service Commission to promote and to co-ordinatetraining.     Very little money had however been madeavailable, so that progress had been slow.     But things. were on the move.(9)    There was a good deal of concern that there was not enough mobility between agencies on the part of civilservants, and it too often happened that a specialised agency was run by an expert who had never seen life out-side his bureau.     A specialised civil servant who reachedtop management within his agency could find life somewhatuncomfortable if he found that he had to justify something to a Congressional sub-committee and had to answer questions, not in terms which were comprehensible only to members of his profession but in language that madepolitical sense to the questioner.      To meet these difficulties, the Civil Service Commission were in courseof producing a new &quot;executive assignment system&quot;.This involved preparing a fairly elaborate inventoryof promising people inside and outside the public service,and requiring the various agencies to examine names in this list when making top appointments, instead of simplypromoting their own people.     This represented the limit of what the Civil Service Commission could do without an alteration in the law.(10)   As regards job classification, the Civil service commission explained that they issued detailed guidance on this but that it was not for them to operate this
guidance.     This was for the agencies.     But all the agencies were inspected from time to time by the 7r/7o / 5Commission, and one of the prime purposes of this - -examination was to ascertain whether the agency had a proper organisation to apply these job-classilicationprinciples.     The risk of &quot;grade escalation&quot; (that is, thetendency for jobs to be more highly graded than theclassifier deems necessary on his criteria) had always tobe watched for.A number of those consulted thought that there were probably too many grades in the hierarchy, although inpractice there was a good deal of skipping of the grades,there was a good deal of criticism of the restrictionson total numbers put by the Bureau of the Budget on those in grade 15. and by law on those in grades 16 to 18.The point was frequently taken also that the rates of payin the super grades were too low.     Lower down, regardwas had to what was paid in comparable employment outside,but the scales were kept down at the top.There was a good deal of disquiet that the rates of payin the upper grades (which, as explained in the previous paragraph are not based on direct comparability withoutside employment) were too low to attract thebrightest recruits.An employee was entitled to a within-grade increase only if it was determined that he was performing at an&quot;acceptable level of competence&quot;.     Each department headhad the authority, which he might delegate, to decide whatconstituted an acceptable level of competence and if the employee met it.     An employee whose level of competencewas determined to be unacceptable had certain appealrights to the Civil Service Commission.     On the basis ofa sample number of employees in 1966, it was found that less than 1 per cent of employees eligible were deniedwithin-grade increases.
Generally, an employee might appeal at any time(through a representative,  if he wished) in regardto the class or grade of his position.     He could make his appeal either to his agency or to the Civil service commission or both.Employee organisation impact on personnel policies and practices was variable.     Where salaries and other conditions of employment were f ixed by the Congress thesematters were not subject to negotiation.     However, whenthe Civil Service Commission was developing classificationand qualification standards or was preparing paylegislation for the President to submit to CoagftoBftrfor example, the comments of employee organisations weresolicited and taken into consideration along with thoseof other interested parties.      (A Commission survey inNovember 1967 showed that k5 per cent or 1,238,7^.8, ofall Federal employees had exclusive representation by labour organisations.)The superannuation arrangements for the Civil service were fairly, generous, but did not appear to provide any new solution to the problem of transfer with outsideemployment, although it was to be noted that a civil servant who put in a certain number of years and thenleft had pretty well an absolute right to return if he wanted to do so later on.     It was noticeable that therewas little interchange between Federal and stateemployment.

PROBLEMS OF THREE SPECIALIST GROUPS:ACCOUNTANTS. LAWYERS AMD RESEARCH OFFICERSIt will be clear from the main body of our report that theposition of specialists in the Civil Service   is in our view one ofthe main problems that the Service has to solve.      We have made proposals for change under a wide variety of heads.     In general,these proposals apply to all groups of specialists alike, and thuscover most of what we have to say about them.2,    On three groups, however, accountants, lawyers and researchofficers, we have further comments and proposals which are not adequately covered by the general terms of the report.     We make themin this appendix.I.      ACCOUNTANTS3,    In Chapter 2 we refer to accounting as an example of a specialistskill where the Civil Service has not recruited sufficient qualifiedpeople nor deployed them in positions of proper responsibility.     Inthis appendix we develop this point at rather greater length.k*    We have received much evidence.     The report of the ManagementConsultancy Group discusses the present role and status of theaccountant (Volume 2, paragraphs 125-135) *     We have received papersfrom the Treasury (Volume 5, no. 9) and the Institution of professional Civil Servants (Volume 5, no. 45), and taken oral evidence from the former.     We have also taken evidence (oral andwritten) from the Accountants Joint Parliamentary Committee (Volume 5,nos. 51 and 52) and (written) from the Institute of Cost and WorksAccountants (Volume 5, no. 89).     The basic facts relating to theAccountant Class are set out in the Treasury&apos;s Introductory FactualMemorandum, Chapter 9 (Volume 4, no. 1). -5&apos;    There can be no doubt that the present position is unsatisfactory and calls for substantial and early improvement.^    In general the Service has failed to take advantage ofimportant developments in industry and commerce during recent years.There, it is generally accepted that accounting is no longer a matter
0f book-keeping   but of financial management in its widest sense.Internal audit is no longer a matter of routine but is animportant element in management services aimed at increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of an organisation; and it is recognisedthat training and experience in accountancy can fit the right manfor the highest managerial posts.    In the Service, on the other hand,the role of the accountant is narrowly conceived.    Accounting isstill mainly concerned with the procedures of cash accountingcarried out by the Executive Class under the direction, where necessary, of the Administrative Class.    Professional accountantsare employed mainly in work involving commercial accounting withina department or concerned with the financial operations of commercialorganisations; examples are given in the Treasury&apos;s paper and inthe report of the Management Consultancy Group.7.    This point can be put still  more forcefully. In spite of the vastincrease in expenditure by the public sector - much of it under thecontrol of the Civil Service - there are posts for only 309 qualifiedaccountants in the entire Service out of the 25,000 qualified  account-ants who make up the accountancy profession in this country, of these 309posts, none carries a salary over  4,500; six carry salaries above 3,650.   Salaries for staff of the right qualification andcompetence are seriously out of line with those in the outside world.8.    Thus, at a time when qualified accountants are in increasing demand throughout industry and commerce, the Service can offer neitherwork of b sufficiently high level nor career prospects of sufficientattraction to bring in good men and women with these importantQualifications and to pay them competitive salaries.9.    This is partly the result of a deliberate decision on the partQf the management of the Service.    It is the practice to employPrivate accountancy firms for major jobs outside the normal routine.There is much sense in this.   It would be wrong for the Service tofry to be self-sufficient in this field, and there is positive advantage in bringing in accountants from outside from time toespecially because methods and skills are constantly changing.&quot;e fio not propose that this practice should be discontinued.   But
l\ ought not to be a substitute for a strong force of highly-qualified professional accountants within the Service.10,   Some of the areas in which more qualified accountants are needed ares-(a) In the Senior Policy and Management Group. In industryqualified accountants play a full role in top managementsince through their training and experience they can contribute much to the solution of major problems. Whilethe Service differs from industry in a number of important respects, we believe that it should follow this example.(b) In purchasing.    The public sector is becoming an increasingly important purchaser of goods and services.    The Governmenthas decided that public purchasing shall be used tosupport its economic ahd financial policies, includingregional policies.    It is in the general interest thatpurchasing by the public sector should be carried outwith maximum efficiency.   The qualified accountant can offer much to achieve this end,particularly in relationto the problems of pricing.(c) In developing accountable and responsible management.    in chapter 5 we referred to the need to develop costing andcontrol procedures to ensure that management has clearobjectives ^gainst which performance can be measured.   Soundaccounting skills will be needed to achieve this purpose.(d) In management services. Again in Chapter 5 we have recommended the expansion of management services throughoutthe Civil Service. In industry the qualified accountant ; hasa central role in management services including regularefficiency audits.   A similar role can be played in theService.11*  We realise that there is a national shortage of qualifiedaccountants and that it will take time to build up an adequate team0? first-class talent.   But we urge the Service to push ah8&apos;adrapidly.   Although the best training for an accountant is often to befound in the broader experience of private practice, the Service ought
in a period of national shortage to be able to help itself by producingfaome of its own talent.   For example, we should like to see traineeaccountants articled to members of the profession within governmentdepartments.    We also suggest that a number of entrants with &quot;A level&quot;or their equivalent should be encouraged to take professional qualifications in accounting and that success in achieving thesequalifications should be rewarded with additional increases in pay.We also suggest that the work now done by qualified accountantsalready in the Service should be examined to see whether some of itcould not be devolved upon less qualified staff, thus freeingqualified accountants for posts of higher responsibility.12.  We propose that accountants should continue to be anidentifiable occupational group within the Service.   The group should include cost and work accountants.   The national institutionsrepresenting the accountancy prof es si on and the cost and worksaccountants are currently discussing a merger. As will be clear fromthe rest of our report, our thinking is very much in line with the conception of more broadly-based groupings of this kind.13.   In recommending a much wider role and greater responsibilityfor the qualified accountant, we do not wish to be understood as implying that the accountant should be regarded as having a unique claimto the  work of financial management.    The much-needed increase intheir numbers will be no substitute for the necessity of ensuring that managers at all levels have an appropriate understanding ofthe importance of sound financial management especially in decision-taking and control.We also wish to emphasise the need for broader training, notonly in the accountant1 s early years (when most of it will take placeoutside and often before entry to the Service), but also at intervals^ring his Civil Service career.    Our witnesses have laid great stress on this in oral evidence.   Especially in management services new techniques are developing so quickly that a man&quot;ill become out-of-date unless he undergoes regular re-toaining.     For the same reason our witnesses thought,   and
I ge agree, that this is work for relatively young men; we doubt iff Qualified accountants (or others) should stay in high-level management services much beyond the age of 50.   We think too that accountingis a field in which movement between the Service and other employmentscan be especially valuable in order to ensure that the methods of the1 Service remain up to date.   Late entry and temporary appointments ofthe kind discussed in general terms in Chapter k should be encouraged.15,   There should be adequate central management of accountants,gg of other specialist staff, by the Civil Service Department.I Accountants will remain scarce and will continue to be distributedaiiong a number of departments in relatively small numbers.     a properly developed system of planned movement and wider careeropportunities will he essential to attract the right men.
II LAWYERSThere is a brief account of the Legal Glass in Chapter 27 ofthe Introductory Factual Memorandum (Volume k, No. 1).    Memorandafrom the Treasury (Volume 5, No. 10) and from the Civil Servicelegal Society (Volume 5* No. 26) are the main written evidence thatVJe have received.   We discussed the problems of the legal, service,11th the Treasury Solicitor and with the Civil Service Legal Society.17,  The Legal Class is one of the most long-standing professionalgroups in the- Civil Service. The tasks and responsibilities placed upon it and the contribution it can make to administration are continually increasing.   There is a serious shortage of lawyers inthe Service.     Our proposals are designed to improve the careermanagement of lawyers as an occupational group and to give them the opportunity to make a wider contribution to the work of theService.Organisation of the Legal Service18.  We agree with the idea put forward in paragraph 9 of theTreasury memorandum that there should be a greater degree of central management and a better integration of the legal Civil Service inEngland and Wales.    The need for central management applies tolawyers as much as to any other group of staff.   At present, as theTreasury memorandum shows, legal staff are irregularly distributed among a large number of departments.    The opportunities forpromotion vary between them.     We should like to see morelawyers moving between departments and more branching out fromthe strict field of their specialisation to take a full part in thenork of policy-making and administration.19.  We have considered what form the central management shouldtake.   At present the Treasury Solicitor, as the head of thedepartment employing the largest numbers of legal staff, is to someextent the unofficial head of the legal profession in the Service,tod some small-scale exchanges of staff are effected by his good officesThere is also a management committee under Treasury chairmanship withto overall concern for the problems of the class.   We think that theroh3 of the Treasury Solicitor should be expanded and put on to a farniaL^is as Head of the Legal Service.   It is appropriate that this
p0gt should be held by a lawyer, and since the management alone ofa service of this size would not constitute a job that carriedthe necessary standing, it should in our view be combined with an8Ctive legal post at the top of the profession,   The treasury solicitor will however need support in this additional task; he cannot be expected, in addition to his heavy legal duties, to devotea great deal of time to managing the Service.   We suggest therefore that the management committee should continue to function and that consideration should be given   to including a representative ofthe legal service (as of other specialist groups - see Chapter 7).in the staff of the Civil Service Department, with any necessarysupporting staff.20.   This proposal does not mean that all departmental legal &quot;branchesshould be brought into the Treasury Solicitor&apos;a Office or thathe. should assume responsibility for their work.   departments should have normal control over their legal branches.   Toe centralasnagement of the legal Service should, however, have a generalconcern with all questions of staff, including recruitment,training and career development, and it should be responsible forthinking constructively about improvements in organisation and methods of work.   In short, in the balance of responsibility between departments and central management, the general principles laiddown in Chapter 7 should be applied in this particular case.21,  Both the Treasury (paragraph 17 of their memorandum) and theCivil Service Legal Society (paragraph 13 of their memorandum) have proposed that certain kinds of legal work, such as conveyancing andlitigation, should be centralised.   This would mean that theremaining legal branches in other departments would consist largelyof lawyers engaged In giving legal advice on the policy of thedepartment.   We agree with this proposal, which should improve efficiency and the economic use of staff, in particular bypermitting greater devolution of work to sub-professionala1;aff and making possible     better career opportunities (seeParagraph 25  below).
22. The legal service that we propose in the preceding paragraphsKoulcl be for England and Wales.   Scotland should clearly continue to^9 a separate legal service organised on similar lines.   the supplementary note of the Civil Service Legal Society draws attention to the problems of the legal service in Scotland.   Many0f them are similar to those of England and Wales and should be similarly dealt with, with suitable adaptations to meetcircumstances in Scotland,itecraitaent23,   The Treasury (paragraph k of their memorandum) and theCivil Service Legal Society (paragraphs 7 and 8 of their memorandum)set out the recruitment position.   The figures are worrying in themselves and more so when account is taken of the age-structure ofthe class, with a high proportion reaching retirement in the next ten years.   The witnesses have indicated that there is also cause for concern about the quality of recruits.   The Treasury say thatthere is a special problem of recruiting very able lawyers foradvisory work.   The background to the problem of recruitment isa national shortage of lawyers.   As with the other classes of theService, we have not examined whether the Service offers competitiverates of pay for lawyers.   We have however received evidence aboutthe career opportunities.   We accept the Treasury&apos;s argument(paragraph 11 of their memorandum) that higher-grade posts are onlyjustified by higher-grade work.   In our view the right approach isto devolve as much work as possible to staff who are not fullyqualified lawyers; this should help to limit the demands within theService for these scarce qualifications.   Career opportunitiesshould then be widened by stimulating movement between departments and by ensuring that lawyers who have the aptitude   and inclinationto move into more general policy and management work are given theopportunity and the necessary training.   We hope that a bigger flow of young lawyers will thus be attracted to the Service.2&apos;u  We think too that the Service should seek to help itself in overcoming the   recruitment problem by producing some of its ownQualified lawyers.   At present all recruits to the legal serviceQaYe already obtained their qualifications outside the Service.   This
,,111 always have to be the principal source of lawyers, becausethe Service needs men and women with general experience of the law.Nevertheless, we think that civil servants with the right aptitudesand interests should have the opportunity to acquire the qualifications to join the legal service.   The contribution thatthis would make to the supply of lawyers would no doubt be limited.But it would be well worth having.    We welcome the Treasury&apos;aproposal (paragraph 18 of their memorandum) that experienced legalexecutive staff should be encouraged and assisted to read for the bar, and, if successful, brought into the professional legal service.Ie also hope that ways and means can be found of attachingarticled clerks to qualified solicitors serving in governmentdepartments.The use of non-professional staff25.   The Civil Service Legal Society have proposed the creationof a separate class of legal executives (paragraphs 15-17 of their memorandum).    We cannot accept this proposal, which is notcompatible with our recommendations for the abolition of separateclasses.   It would not in any case solve what we take to be the essence of the problem, that is, the provision of reasonable careeropportunities for legal executives.    We are, however, very much in sympathy with the thinking underlying the Society&apos;s proposal.We favour more specialisation among executive staff.    We are particularly in favour of it among those who work in support of professional staff, because it gives the qualified specialists thereliable, experienced backing they need, enables them to concentrate on the work for which they have been specially trained, and produces3 more economic use of skilled manpower and a source of greaterjob-satisfaction for all concerned.    We recommend therefore thatiegal executive work should be recognised as a specialism and thatadministrative staff should be encouraged to take it up.
7QOo o ojhey should be given proper training and career developmenta9 specialists; and encouragement and reward should be given forthe acquisition of sub-professional legal qualifications as wellaS for the full qualifications we have discussed above.     Thegreater devolution of work to sub-professional staff and thecentralisation of certain kinds of legal work that   we have recommended should, w e hope, enable the Service to provide attractiveopportunities for promotion in this field.Thejilace of lawyers in administration26,   It is most desirable that lawyers should play their full partin the consideration and formulation of policy.   We suspect thatpractice in this matter now varies a good deal between departments.In our view, close co-operation and discussion between lawyers andadministrators should be a regular part of policy-making.   This shouldbe a mutually enriching process from which the public interestisould gain.   While administration in this country is less juridicalthan in many others, there is a legal element in many administrativequestions; it needs to be taken fully into account at an   early stage.   A good lawyer with deep experience of the affairs of his department can therefore make a valuable contribution to thepolicy-forming work in his department.27.  In so far as this is a matter of structure and organisation,it should be assisted by our proposal in Chapter 6 for a unifiedSenior Policy and Management G;roup in departments, of which,of course, the senior lawyers will be members.   We hope that areality will be made of their membership of the group and thatthey will be regarded as being concerned with the affairs of theDepartment at large.   As the Civil Service legal Society agreed in discussion with us, this wD.1 require some change of attitudeson both sides.   While we think too that some, though perhaps notmany, lawyers will wish to be considered for jobs of a more generaladministrative or managerial character,and that it is importanttaat those with the desire and the aptitude should be encouraged to do ao, we wish to lay special emphasis on the need for a widerconcept of the contribution that lawyers can make as lawyers totQe problems of modern administration.
III RESEARCH OFFICERS - -,,g(  The Research Officer Class are employed in the collection,analysis, interpretation and appreciation of information mainly inthe field of the social sciences; they prepare studies, reports and surveys.    They are principally employed in the intelligence branches0f the Ministry of Defence, in the Home Office, in the Ministry of housing and Local Government, in the Ministry of Technology and inthe Board of Trade.    They are a graduate class, requiring a firstor second-class honours degree, or a post-graduate or research degreein geography, economics, statistics, sociology or other appropriatesubject.   There is a brief account of the class, its duties,numbers, pay, structure and recruitment in Chapter 39 of theIntroductory Factual Memorandum (Volume 4, no. 1).29.   Research Officers were Investigated &quot;by the ManagementConsultancy Group; the findings are set out in paragraphs 136-147of their report (Volume 2). Several serious criticisms were madeof the present employment of the Research Officers and it was foundthat their status and prospects were unduly depressed.   This latter point was also made by the Institution of Professional CivilServants in their memorandum on a Social Scientist Group (volume 5*no. 39).30.  Research is not the exclusive preserve, of the Research OfficerClass in the Civil Service.   Apart from research in science and technology, which is of course carried out by appropriate specialistsresearch is from time to time part of the job of economists,statisticians, and other specialists.   Much of this research hasachieved a high reputation.   Nevertheless, research on social andsome economic matters has been relatively neglected; the service has only recently and slowly begun to fill the gaps.    The position&quot;f the Research Officer Class reflects this neglect.51.  The main features that illustrate the unsatisfactory position0f Research Officers are as follows;-(a)   They are often poorly used and confined to a back-roomrole too far removed from the main stream of policy decisions.
(b) The work they are asked to do is frequently of a qualitybelow their capabilities.(c) They are often without routine clerical assistance.(d) Their career prospects in their class are inferior to those&apos;   of the Economist Glass for which the recruitmentrequirements are similar and also to those of theAdministrative Class (fuller details on this point aregiven in paragraphs llxk-lk^ of the report of the ManagementConsultancy Group)**.)2, We have recommended in Chapter 5 that the policy-planning function of department s should be considerably strengthened and that research should be recognised as an essential component of this work.Thus, we have suggested the creation of planning Units headed bysenior Policy Advisers.     We have considered whether, when the research function is strengthened in the ways we have proposed, theresill still be a need to recruit a special group of staff to doresearch work.     It could be argued that this need would disappearin the social and economic areas of the Service.     We arerecommending that administrators should cease to be untrained&quot;generalists&quot; whose knowledge of the subject-matter of their jobs is limited to what they pick up in the course of a brief tenure.     under our proposals, administrators will be thoroughly trained in appropriatedisciplines.     Their careers will be planned to enable them to becomereally familiar with the subjects on which they are working.      Inthe course of their training some of them will acquire an unstanding of research methods and techniques.     Some of the best will servefor substantial periods at a relatively early stage of their careersto the Planning Units.     In short, administrators will have a muchoetter appreciation and understanding of research, of its scope andlimitations, its methods, its evaluation;    many will have done it.jtoour view however, this does not mean that special research staff canite dispensed with.     What it does mean is that their contribution canbecome more effective.
I -    391jj,  We think that there are three reasons why the Service shouldcontinue to recruit staff for the purpose of doing research work,pirst, knowledge and skills.   While the trained, professionaladministrator will be more conversant with research matters, hewill not normally have the same degree of 3kill in the conduct of research as a trained research worker.    Secondly, the demands ofdav-to-day administration.   This is the prime job for whichadministrators are recruited and its pressures must make itdifficult for them to remain at the frontiers of new knowledge.Thirdly, qualities,    As the Treasury pointed out in their paper on the question of a Social Scientist Group (Volume 5, no. 40),a man may be qualified to make a valuable contribution to research work, but he may not have the qualities required of an administrator.There are men and women who prefer to be researchers rather thanadministrators or managers.    Some of them see their careers not primarily as civil servants but as researchers, moving betweenuniversities and research foundations, central government, localgovernment and intergovernmental organisations, industry and so on;the Service should allow for a good deal of this in-and-outmovement on the part of its research staff, which is indeedvaluable becauses it refreshes ideas, skills and outlook andhelps to maintain contacts with the outside world.    For all these reasons, there is advantage in recruiting research staff to a group in which they can be sure of doing this kind of work.)k.   Normally research officers should be employed withindepartments, and especially in Planning Units.   We would alsoexpect that some of the research projects of the Civil ServiceCollege would be carried out by research officers.   Whever theyare employed, they should not be regarded as there just to serveup commissioned research with no further interest in the matter.They should take part in the process of considering what research should be done and its translation into policy.35.   The introduction of a unified grading structure should do much*o provide better career opportunities both in research itself andin a wider administrative field; (age-bara to promotion, here as elsewhere, would disappear).   It should also be recognised that their
experience in analysis, and in the evaluation and quantificationof the effects of policy, their familiarity with methods ofsystematic research and with the progress of research outside theService gives them a highly suitable background for high-leveladministrative posts in the Service.   Departments should thereforepay careful attention to the early identification of those withprospective talents for these posts.   Their progress intoadministration, however, should not in most cases take the formof an abrupt transition.   We see it as a steady process of moving into jobs of a more administrative character, but, initiallyat least, into administration closely related to their specificareas of research.
-j p( -jRECRUITMENT PROCEDURE *&quot; 0 3 -JSelection for established posts in the Civil Service is theresponsibility of the Civil Service Commission.   The procedures theCommission uses vary for the different classes; they are set out in following paragraphs, mainly taken from the Commission&apos;s evidenceoublished in Volume k, Section III.pBKSENT PROCEDURES^Administrative Class2,     At Assistant Principal level candidates are selected either by: -(a) a qualifying written examination in general subjects followedby an interview and then by written papers in optionalacademic subjects at honours^degree level (Method I);(b) a qualifying written examination in general subjectsfollowed by tests and interviews at the Civil ServiceSelection Board lasting two daysj and interview before aFinal Board (Method II),In Method I success is determined by the aggregate mark for interviewand academic papers ; in Method II by the mark awarded by the FinalSelection Board.   Method II is now the more important method of selection and produces about three-quarters of the successfulcandidates.3.   Selection for the Administrative Glass at Principal level is similarto that described in 2(b) above, under Method II; but for one form of recruitment there is no written qualifying examination.k.     Selection for the Administrative Class at Assistant Secretarylevel (two or three posts a year) is by means of a preliminaryinterview of those who from their qualifications and experience seemmost suitable, and, for those who in the light of these interviewsmerit further consideration, an interview before the Final SelectionBoard, he.Executive Class5.     Recruitment to the Executive Class is from,among candidatesbetween the ages of 17* and 2&apos;8 (recently raised fbdm&quot;&amp;) J it is byinterview of those with prescribed G.C.E. qualifications including
passes at Advanced level, or with equivalent qualifications. Amongcandidates from Her Majesty&apos;s Forces or Her Majesty&apos;s Overseas    .jy4Civil Service selection is by means of a qualifying written examinatiorin general subjects (from which candidates with appropriatequalifications are exempt) together with an interview; success depends on the mark awarded by the selection hoard.Th^Clerical Classg,    Over most of the clerical field, recruitment has beendelegated to departments.    Candidates for established posts musthave an e ducational qualification based on the Ordinary level of theG.C.E. or an equivalent educational qualification.   Where necessary,departments may engage temporary officers with less than theprescribed educational qualifications; these officers may have alater opportunity of establishment by taking a Civil service commission examination.7.    The Commission itself recruits Clerical Officers in various ways.It conducts examination on a country-wide basis for candidates from.M. Forces and H.M. Overseas Civil Service, on the basis either ofO.C.E. qualifications (or equivalent) and interview^ or by written examiniation.   It also supplements the efforts of departments byrecruiting Clerical Officers for established posts in or near london.   This recruitment is partly by interview of candidates withfi.CE. qualifications who are under 20, and partly by written examiniation of candidates who do not have the prescribed G.C.E.qualifications.9.    Recruitment to Clerical Assistant posts is on similar lines but lower educational qualifications are required.The Specialist Classes10.   Candidates are usually required to have some particularscientific, professional, academic or technical qualified on, and sometimes relevant practical experience.   Selection is by interview.Scientists, engineers, architects, accountants, lawyers, doctors,Psychologists, librarians, and a wide range of other specialists as^11 as their supporting staff   (technicians, draughtsmen etc.)   areselected in this way.   Initial recruitment by departments in atemporary capacity, leading to permanent apppointment later, is acommon feature in these classes.
rflnpngj;D CHANGES IN RECRUITMENT PROCEDURE      - &quot;n    we have proposed (in Chapter 3) that the Civil Service commission should he integrated with the Civil Service Department,    vve also madegeneral proposals about the recruitment procedure for: -(a) specialist staff (both graduate and non-graduatej;(b) graduates for the administrative groups;(c) the non-specialist &quot;A level&quot; and &quot;0 level&quot; entry.Members of selection boards12.   First we recommend changes in the composition of interview boardsWho   recruit staff at 11(a) and (c) above.   At present where the recruitment of these categories is done centrally, the interviewboards normally comprise a chairman and at least two and not more than four members.    In addition to members drawn from departments, themembers are drawn from panels of interviewers maintained by theCommission; the chairman is either a senior member of the commissioner is drawn from one of the panels.    For the appointments at 11(a)above, the present panel of interviewers consists exclusively of scientists and professional men, most of whom are retired civilservants.   For  the appointments at 11(c) above, the panel ofinterviewers consists in the main of retired administrative and seniorexecutive civil servants, headmasters   and Inspectors of Schools,and includes a few former members of the Overseas Civil Service andthe Armed Forces.    In addition to our recommendation that representatives of departments should be in a majority on the boards,le also consider that serious consideration should be given tothe age structure of each board, both for central and departmentalrecruitment,   $e think it wrong that retired civil servants should play a large part in the selection of young people particularly at atime when the tasks of the Service are changing so rapidly.    In ourview all boards should be predominantly composed of men and women whowe still on the active list with a good many years still to go beforeretirement.    we realise that departments often find it hard to sparegood people (and they must &quot;be good) for work on selection boards.But we regard it as essential that serving civil servants should playto?ge part in the recruitment of the next generation.    This shouldbe given high priority in allocating the time of those concerned.
39613-p:jCPiiitment of graduates for administrative works   majority of us* recommended in Chapter 3 that the recruitmentgraduates for  the administrative groups should he by modified formseither the present Method I or Method II.   A minority of usIjecommended recruitment to this category by a modified form of Methodonly.   We set out in the following paragraphs the general line ofI these suggested modifications.PMd.:;-lnHi,  In Method I at present papers are set and marked in a wide range of university subjects at honours degree standard.    The numbers taking:tie academic papers in Method I have dwindled steadily in recent years.Ifhe reasons for the decline in its popularity must lie to a large8xtent in the natural reluctance of candidates to take anothersritten examination so soon after final degree examinations, or ifthey have left university, to take an examination of this kind when they have been for some time away from academic study.    Moreover, the side variations in the content of first-degree courses, the growth of new specialisations, and the very wide choice of special subjects and optional subjects in university courses have made it increasingly difficult to devise syllabuses for the Commission^ examination wniehadequately reflect all the main degree courses in the universitiesof the United Kingdom, and so cater fairly and attractively for allpotential candidates.    There are already over 160 papers in theI examination (from which each candidate has  to choose between five and seven).   But the range of subjects and of papers is now unsatisfactory.IA very large expansion in the number of papers would be required tomake the examination fair to candidates from all universities bycatering for ail the options they can take.    In fact this is virtuallyimpracticable, and, in any event, hardly seems worth the effortI wen we consider that last year only 5h candidates sat the examination.15.  Though Method I is clearly unsatisfactory and unfair in itsI present form, the majority of us consider that it should be retained in a modified form.    It should remain primarily as a writtenI lamination.    The papers set, however, should be limited to those that have an obvious vocational link with the work of one or other of the&apos; See paragraph 82.
aaministrative groups or the further specialisms that may   developwithin them;  the questions should be designed to test the candidate^ability to relate his knowledge to the problems of modern government.It will be for the Civil Service Department to s ettle the precise  597subjects a candidate may offer in the examination and also the numberof papers a candidate will be required to take,    vve would expect the papers to offer candidates the opportunity of anwering questionsrelated to the problems of modern government in one or other of thefollowing main fields: - economics and business studies, social and administrative studies, science and technology.Method II16,   In Chapter 3 the Committee unanimously recommended changes inthe procedures and staffing of the present Method II.    We said thatthere should be a larger representation of employing departments amongthe selectors;  that their age distribution should be changed toincrease the proportion of younger men; and that the part played bythe Final Selection Board should be revised.   Further, those of uswho recommend &quot;preference for relevance&quot; consider that the selectorsshould be required, in addition to their assessment of aptitudeand ability, to give appropriate weight to the relevance of an individual^ graduate or post-graduate qualifications to theadministrative group in which he wishes to work and to the specificrequirements of particular departments.   We elaborate these proposals in further detail in the following paragraphs.   They are bestconsidered against the present form of Method II.17.   Method II at present is divided into three parts as follows: -(a) There is a written qualifying examination in which allcandidates have to take the following three written papers: -(i) essay (which carries 100 marks),(ii) English (which carries 200 marks),(iii) general paper (which carries 150 marks).(b) Those getting 230 marks or more out of the possible totalof U50, together with borderline candidates selected forfurther consideration in the light of their records and reports, then attend the Civil service Selection Board ingroups of five for a series of tests and interviews extending
-    398over two days.   The tests for each group are conducted-bya chairman, an observer and a psychologist.   There are two groups of tests.   The first group are each separatelymarked out of 300 as follows: -(iv) a written appreciation,(v) a drafting test,(vi) a committee exercise: performance as chairman,(vii) a committee exercise: performance as member,(viii) a group discussion,(ix) an interview (hO minutes) with the chairman of the selection board who gives special attention to how a candidate has spent his time since leavingschool, to his leisure pursuits and to his reasonsfor seeking a job in the public service,(x) an interview (1+0 minutes) with the observer,mainly to assess the quality of the candidate&apos;mind,(xi) an interview (iiQ minutes) with the psychologist, to assess his temperament and personality.The second group consists of psychological and cognitivetests designed to measure aspects of intellectual ability.They are each separately marked on a seven-point scale asfollows: -(xii) two short intelligence tests which provideevidence of basic mental ability, though theyassume a considerable educational sophisticationand facility in the language,(xiii) a statistical-inference test jrhich gives an indication of ability to think numerically,(xiv) a short exercise testing the range but not the depth of general information about current affairs,not too narrowly interpreted.In addition, close attention is also paid to reports fromschool and university; and the assessors have to make their best estimate of potential for future development.   The
marks given for the various tests are not added together toproduce an aggregate score, and, as at present devis-ed,    3  are not capable of being so added.    The chairman and theobserver arrive after discussion at an overall mark (outof 300) which is then put before the Final Selection board at (c) be1ow.(c) Those reaching a certain minimum standard in the tests at(b) above then go before the Final Selection Board, whosecomposition is set out in paragraph 19(b) below.    the interview before this board is decisive; it determineswhether or not the candidate is offered an appointment inthe Service.18.   vVe have serious doubts about the staffing and methods of workof the Civil Service Selection Board: -(a) The present age-distribution of the Chairmen and Observerswho conduct the two-day test at 15(b) above is not properlybalanced.   Twelve out of the twenty chairmen are over theage of 60 (one of them over 65), and these twelve are those most regularly used.    Sixteen of the twenty are over 55.Thus very few chairmen are between 35 and 55, and those whofall within this age-span are the least frequently used atpresent.    On the other hand twenty-three of the f0arty-fourobservers are under the age of 35 (two of them under 30)andfifteen are between the ages of 36 and i+u.    The age-groupbetween 35 and 55 is thus too little represented.(b) When the tests at 15(b) have been completed the chairman,the observer and the psychologist together consider the candidate^ performance and agree on a final mark (out of300) which is the one which then goes to the FinalSelection Board.   Naturally, in agreeing this mark they take into account the candidate&apos;s marks on each of the separatetests; but their overall mark is their impression of the candidate&apos;s general performance (much influenced by theinterviews at 17(b) (ix), (x) and (xi) above) rather thanthe total of the candidate&apos;s marks in each of the component
-     400parts.    In a series of tests that seek to he as objectiveas possible, it is disturbing that the final assessment ismade in a way in which subjective impressions inevitablyplay a large part in determining the candidate&apos;s finalmark.15,  We also have serious doubts about the role, composition and method of work of the Final Selection Board:  -(a) It makes the final choice of those to be offered an appointment in the Service.   Though it naturally pays greatattention to the mark given to a candidate by the CivilService Selection Board (C.S.S.B.) and to the reports of thechairman, observer and psychologist, it is not bound by theC.S.S.B.&apos;s findings.    The effect of this seems to be to givetoo much weight to the general (and necessarilyimpressionistic) interview by the Final Selection board which lasts less than forty minutes, and too little weight tothe tests at C.S.S.B. which last two days and which,notwithstanding our doubts at 18(b) above, provide the basis for a searching and objective assessment.(b) The composition of the Final Selection Board is in ourview open to question.   At present the Commission^ aim isto assemble, whenever practicable, a board   that, consists ofthe First Civil Service Commissioner (as chairman), twouniversity representatives, two serving civil servants (oneof whom is a Principal Establishment Officer), one womanand one representative from industry or the trade unions.When one of these cannot be obtained, a retired civil servantis often called upon.    If, as is frequently the case, oneof the candidates being interviewed is also beingconsidered for the Diplomatic Service or for a Clerkship inthe House of Commons, then one of the serving civil servantswill be from the Diplomatic Service or a Clerk of the House.Thus, on these occasions, apart from the First Civil service commissioner, there may be only one serving civil servant
from the Home Civil Service on the hoard making the finaldecision on a candidate^ suitability for that Service,(c) Although members of the Final Selection Board are expectedto rely heavily on the reports on candidates from C.S.S.B  ,many members of the board have never seen any canaidate putthrough the various C.S.S.B. tests or have any real knowledgeof them.20,   The full solution of the problems to whicn we have drawn attention in paragraphs 18 and 19 above calls for a more searchinginquiry than we have been able to undertake.   We are clear thatemploying - departments should play a larger part in the selectionprocess than they do at present.    We also believe that most, if not all, the chairmen of C.S.S.B. should be drawn from the 35-55age-group; if there is to be an interview board in addition to theCivil Service Selection Board,  the comments we have made on the ageof members of selection boards in paragraph 12 also apply to it.21.   tfor the rest, while we make no detailed recommendationsourselves, our chief concern is that ways should be found of turningSethod II into a process that is less subjective in character.    Thiscalls for further inquiry.   We have considered three possible linesof approach: -(a) The assessment of a candidate should be based on the cumulative total of the marks he has gained at the various stages of the selection process.    Methods of markingperformance in the various types of  test should be devised tomake this aggregation possible.(b) The Final Selection Board should be abolished, and thedecision to take or reject a candidate should be taken at theend of the C.S.S.B. process.    The argument for this would bethat the Final Selection Board is bound to rely too muchupon personal and social evaluation, and that a three-stageselection process is unnecessarily lengthy (no-onestarting from scratch would devise a three-stage systemtoday).    The C.S.S.B. would probably need to be reinforced
for this purpose, e.g. hy attaching representatives fromuniversities, industry and government departments to theG.S.S.B. for the appropriate stage of the proceedings;hut it would he important to avoid re-introducing an excessive element of subjective judgement,(c) The final stage of the selection process should still be a subsequent interview by a separate Interview Board, but tnisboard should be limited to giving its own mark for the interview it conducts (as in Method I); the candidate&apos;splace in the final list would then be determined by theaggregate of the marks given by the Interview Board (wnichwould thus cease to be a Final Selection Board), by G.3.S.B.and by the examiners at the qualifying written examination.The scope of the further inquiry22,  We proposed in Chapter 3 (paragraph 70) that a further inquiry should seek means of speeding up recruitment procedures.    We  thinkthat it should also consider ways of reducing the subjective element in Method II, paying particular attention to the views we have discussed above.      Its object would be to make recommendations, withinthe framework of our report, for as speedy and objective a selectionprocess as possible.23.   The report of the sociological survey which we are publishingin Volume 3 also contains a great deal of material that is highlyrelevant to the problems of recruitment.    For unavoidable reasons,this report could not be ready in time for us to give full consideration to its findings.   We have drawn attention in Chapter 1to Dr. Halseyfs analysis of the trend of recruitment to theAdministrative Glass since the war; he finds an increasing social and educational uniformity.   Dr. Halsey also finds evidence of a declinein the intellectual quality of successful candidates (as measured byelass of degree).    In our view, the inquiry we have proposed should include a thorough examination of this evidence and of the inferencesthat should be drawn from it for future methods of selection of allkinds.
^, We suggest that those who carry out this inquiry should        403include management consultants, who may he able to make a specialcontribution to the problem of reducing the time taken by the recruitment process, members drawn from the universities and thoseKith expert knowledge of personnel selection both within the Serviceand outside.jffifi application of &quot;preference for relevance&quot;fu  Thosd of us who recommend &quot;preference for relevance&quot; have con-sidered various possible ways to give effect to this principle .    one possibility would be for C.3.S.B. to assess the relevance of the studies of the candidate by reference to the actual curricula of the courses he has pur sued. *     Another would be to include in the G.S.S.B.procedure an interview designed to test the relevance of the candidate&apos;s studies.    Another would be to give no preference in the selection procedure itself but to encourage self-selection by offeringadditional increments to those successful candidates whose studieshad been most relevant to their future work, and who would thus be expected to make a valuable contribution to it more quickly.26.   On balance, however, most of us who recommend preference forrelevance would prefer to give a small but definite advantage torelevance in the selection procedure itself by means of an objectivetest.   One way of doing this might be to include such a test in thewit ten qualifying examination.    This is already done to some smallextent by the inclusion of a statistical-inference section in thegeneral paper.    We suggest that this practice might well be extendedto provide in each of the papers alternative sections in which onealternative specifically tests the candidate &apos;s ability to deai withI modern social, political, economic and scientific problems - similar,in effect, to the questions now set in Prance for entry to theScole Rationale d&apos;Administration.    These sections would carry rather higher marks than the   &quot;traditional&quot; sections; a candidate who was ableto make profitable use of this option would carry his advantage,under a cumulative marking system of the kind we have discussed,through to the final stage of the selection process.    We leave the&apos; Sir Edward Boyle, Sir William Cook and Mr. Robert Sheldon think thatthis course should be adopted.
size of the advantage in terms of numbers of marks for considerationby the Civil Service Department.    It should be sufficiently large toindicate clearly the Service&apos;s special interest in recruitingthose whose studies have already partially equinped them to handle the problems of modern government.   At the same time however, itshould not be so great as  to discourage the candidature ofoutstandingly able men and women who have studied other,  &quot;irrelevant&quot;disciplines.27,   It may well be that after consultation with the universitiesthe civil  service Department may propose a better way of introducing an element of &quot;preference for    relevance&quot; in Method II.Our proposal at pa/a graph 26 is no more than an illustration of one possible .way.    ..e should be content with any detailed scheme theGivil Service Department might subsequently propose provided that itmaintained the spirit of our intentions.
THE RECRUITMENT OF GRADUATESIn proposing the merger of the Administrative and ExecutiveClasses (Volume 5, No.l) the Treasury put forward two main reasons.One was that the character of Civil Service work had changed in thelast 20 to 30 years; in consequence the existing division of this-jart of the Service into these two classes now hindered the most advantageous deployment of staff.    ,-Ve have dealt with this point in chapter 6.2,    The second was that the pattern of recruitment to theAdministrative and Executive Classes no longer fits the changingpattern of the country&apos;s educational system.    Thus the good18-year-old who before the war entered the Service after takinghis Higher School Certificate now tends to go on to higher education and is thus lost to the Service for entry at that level.    At thesame time, at the graduate level only a tiny minority are potentialrecruits for the highly selective Administrative Glass, while theExecutive Class is not attractive to the rest.    Therefore, theTreasury proposed the merger of the Administrative and ExecutiveClasses with an enlarged graduate recruitment to the new combinedclass.   All graduates in future,  they suggested, should enter at thesame grade; but, in order not to deter the graduate of outstandingability, the Treasury recommended that he should be &quot;starred&quot; andafter entry to the Service should be treated like the presentAssistant Principal entry.3.    In our view this second argument and the proposals that flow from it are not well-founded.    For one thing the projections ofthe future output of the educational system supplied to us by theDepartment of Education and Science which we reproducein Volume h, Section II, suggest that the supply of 18-year-oldswith two or more &quot;A levels&quot; (the current requirement for entry tofte Executive Class) will in fact continue to increase for the foreseeable future, though not steadily and at a slower rate than the^tput of graduates.   With a steadily enlarging 18-year-old output0n to the labour market there is no certain evidence that the quality of this output will be lower than it has been in the past; only
if the national pool of ability were both fully tapped by the ,        - ^(-universities and other institutions of higher education and staticfould there be reason to suppose that the quality of the 18-year-oldoutput would decline.    Thus, in our view the case is not established that the graduate intake into the civil  Service ought to be increased on the sole grounds that the supply of good non-graduates is dryingup.l    Any proposal to increase the graduate intake must, therefore, bebased on different grounds.    In fact, we think that the Service is likely in the future to seek to employ a larger proportion of graduatesthan at present.    The changing nature of the tasks of the Serviceand the development of more advanced and sophisticated managementtechniques increasingly require more highly qualified manpower.Further, the service does not succeed now in recruiting all thegraduates it needs.    It manages to meet most of its requirements for graduates with the higher classes of degree, for example, thoserecruited to the Administrative and Scientific Officer Glasses.    Itis not successful in recruiting enough graduates of less outstandingacademic attainments.    This is because under the existing system ofclasses these other graduates are recruited mainly to work in a class and grade deemed appropriate for the &quot;A level&quot; entry.    In thelight of these considerations and in view of the larger graduateoutput from the universities, it would be surprising if the Servicedid not in the future employ an increased proportion of graduates.In any event, our general proposals for recruitment and trainingmust allow for this .5.    If there is a larger graduate entry, the problem arises of making clear that the Service is offering the outstandingly able graduate an attractive career.   The Treasury proposal for this was that a proportion of graduates, roughly equivalent to the size of thePresent Assistant Principal intake, should be &quot;starred&quot; or otherwiseidentified on the strength of their academic records and theirPerformance at the selection stage.    It proposed that these graduatesshould enter one or two increments higher up the scale and should havea career in their first years close to that of the present Assistant
principal-    The remainder of the graduate entry was expected to entert the present Executive Officer grade (i.e. the grade and level ofresponsibility to which an &quot;A level&quot; school-leaver is posted atoresent)9 and remain there: for five years before being promoted tothe equivalent of Higher Executive Officer level (i.e. two ranksj,elow the starred graduate after the same period).   We recognise thatthe Service needs to attract graduates of the highest calibre, butse feel unable to accept &quot;starring&quot; on entry.    Our reasons are: -(a) The proposal would to all intents and purposes involve the perpetuation of the present division between the -administrative and Executive Glasses.(b) Because the &quot;starred&quot; graduates were to have different, and better, training facilities immediately after entry ascompared with the &quot;unstarred&quot;, it would be clear to thelatter that their prospects in the Service were likely to beinferior to those of the &quot;starred&quot; graduates.    Thus ablegraduates of a kind greatly needed by the Service would be reluctant to come in on an &quot;unstarred&quot; basis.(c) We do not consider that academic performance at university and performance at the selection stage are a reliable enoughmeans of distinguishing between those graduates who fromthe start should be groomed for the Service&apos;s top jobs andthose who should not.   Actual performance on the job duringthe first few years in the Service should be the determining factor.(d) We cannot believe that the majority of graduates would be content to do a job at the present Executive Officer level ofresponsibility for their first five years in the Service.If this were the extent of the initial offer, they would not come in.0-   The Treasury&apos;s &quot;starring&quot; proposals to attract outstandingly*le graduates were concerned only with recruitment to the mergedAfadnlstrative and Executive Glasses.   There was no similar proposali0r the graduate intake into the specialist classes, where no merger,ae proposed.   However, the short-term forecast by the Treasury which
fe publish in Volume ix shows that the demand for graduates withcertain kinds of specialist qualifications will increase over thenext few years .   Our recommendations for the reform of the ServiceKill open a wider role for the specialists than they have had in theoast.   It is therefore, in our view just as important to make itclear to candidates for the various specialist groups as it is tothe graduates covered by the Treasury&apos;s &quot;starring&quot; proposal, thatthe Service is offering the best of them an attractive career.71    Accordingly, we have proposed in Chapter 3 that, though allgraduates should enter the same training grade, those judgedoutstandingly able and well-qualified on entry should be offered astarting salary two or three increments above the basic for therrade.   This should apply equally to those recruited for specialistiork as to those brought in for the new administrative groups.    Thesore detailed application of these proposals would in our view mean that: -(a) All graduates should initially be placed in posts thoughtappropriate to their ability and to the experience they need.(b) The post-entry training given to graduates should bedetermined by an assessment of how they have performed andthe aptitudes they have shown in one or more jobs, and not by whether they were judged worth extra increments at the selection stage,(c) A graduate should be posted from the training grade to ajob at the level of responsibility appropriate to his ability when: -(i) the Service is satisfied that it has assessed his ability and, as far as possible, his potential, onthe basis of his actual performance in the Service,(ii) his post-entry training is completed;At this point (which would not be later than five yearsafter entering the Service), graduates should leave thetraining grade and the extra increments which some of them had to start with should disappear.   We think it important that the best graduates should be promoted to posts in the
new grade equivalent to the present Principal, PrincipalScientific Officer or Senior Grade Engineer no less quicklythan Assistant Principals are promoted to Principal today.g(    we cannot predict the size of the likley increase in the numbersof graduates recruited direct into the Service after the completionof their formal education.    At present the Service recruits around1,900 graduates and equivalents each year, including about 90Assistant Principals, 100 Executive office is and 50 Tax Inspectorsand Ministry of Labour cadets; and about 350 scientists, 1+00engineers and over 150 in other Works Group grades (mainly architects,valuers and surveyors) among a large variety of others fromspecialist disciplines.    Information however is not available to showwhat proportion of the total enter at stages later than thecompletion of their formal education.    It varies by class and is substantial in some specialist disciplines.    The Treasury have estimated that this figure of 1,900 will rise to about 2,100 by1970 (see Volume h, Section II).   Within this total, they foreseean increased demand for certain kinds of specialist graduates.    Overa rather longer period they believe that a substantial additionwill be needed to the graduate entry for administrative work.   Therate of increase and the pattern of entry as between differentdisciplines will depend upon the extent to which new tasks are imposedupon the Service and the levels and kinds of skill they require.    Ourown proposals, if accepted, will also affect the pattern: a substantially larger late entry will reduce the demand for graduatesdirect from university; wider opportunities for specialists will affect the distribution between disciplines.   We are not able to assess the probable quality (as opposed to quantity) of the 18-year-old entry into the Service in the years immediately ahead.    The rateof increase in different categories must therefore be a matter forPragmatic decision over the years.   We believe that our proposals for
reoruitment and training will enable the Service to handle whateverincrease is likely to be required, and whatever pattern it may need to take.   The Service should not however seek to employ moregraduates than a rigorous analysis of the work shows to be necessary.
INTERCHANGE OP STAFF iVITH OTHER EMPLOYMENTSIn Chapter k we recommended much more determined efforts topromote short-term interchanges of staff with other employments,    Weacloiowledge the undoubted difficulties.    But the value of interchange,j3th to the Service and the other employments concerned, is so greatt^t energetic efforts should be made to overcome them.    We think thata considerable expansion of interchange is feasible,2,    The evidence presented to us is nearly unanimous in supporting the desirability of such expansion.    It comes from organisations in private industry and commerce, local government, nationalised industries and other public bodies,  trades unions, professionalassociations and many individuals      The idea commands wide supportathin the Service from management, staff associations and individualsalike.),   The idea is not new, but it has never got very far in the past.This has not been for lack of advocacy; but general goodwill hasauickly run into the sands of practical difficulty.    What hasencouraged us on this occasion is the attitude of the Service&apos;spotential partners in a programme of interchange.   They have expressedsupport in clear terms; some of them have made practical proposals.The Service should take them at their word.\,   Programmes of interchange involve certain risks for both sides.Some loaned staff may be drawn to stay with their temporary employer;there are risks of embarrassment, of the leakage of confidential information, of the wrong use of personal contacts.    We believe thatthese are risks that should be taken; when the Service and the outsidewr Id are so deeply involved in each other&apos;s affairs, the dangers ofisolation are much more serious than the risks we have referred to.5.   The difficulties are real enough but we believe that many of themcan be overcome by concentrating on what will be most useful to bothsides.   We are particularly grateful here to the Confederation ofTitian Industry whose supplementary evidence (Volume 5, no.69)identifies many of the main problems and suggests how they might be solved.
1r    interchange is relatively easier to promote for specialists thanit is for administrators.    Their work in the Service is generallyore nearly akin to that of specialists outside.    The value ofinterchange in their case lies in the fact that the civil  Servicesocialist cannot always acquire within the Service the knowledge and,still more,  the practical experience that his work requires.    Theengineer whose work consists mainly of monitoring the work of otheraigineers outside the Service is an example.    He needs a period ofattachment to an outside employment in which he can practise andIrefresh his&apos; professional skill - a period, therefore, long enough toenable him to do a fully responsible job.i,   The case of the administrator is usually different.    Sometimeshe too needs a long attachment of, say, two years.    This arises when;ne pattern of his career makes it especially important that he shouldacquire knowledge in depth of a kind that can come only from a workingexperience of another sphere of activity.    One field wnich seems ton to offer considerable opportunities here is local government,&quot;utual involvement is increasing all the time:  it is most desirablethat these two branches of the public service should have a realinowledge and understanding of each other and should share their skillsand experience .    In the past this has been difficult to arrange; localjovernment, with its large number of small units, has not employed;iiiinistrators of the civil  Service kind.    But as local governmentlomes increasingly to recognise administration as a professionalMill in its own right  (and possibly moves to larger units ofJiministrat ion), and as the civil  service for its part comes to proauceadministrators who have specialised in various fields that are of concern to local government, we hope that this situation will change.&quot;6 welcome the recommendation of the Committee on the Staffing of^cal Government for a central staff organisation which could handlefle mechanics of interchange; and the evidence submitted to us by the^ociation of Municipal Councils (Volume 5, no.56), the Countycouncils Association (Volume no.73) and the Greater London Counciltone 5, no.79), all of whom are in favour of making a start.
j(   More often however, the best arrangement where administrators areconcerned is likely to be a shorter attachment or study-visit,jgrtly this is because long attachments are often uneconomic:    in many:arts of industry, for example, the work is so different from that0f the Civil Service administrator, and it therefore takes so longfor him to become able to carry real responsible:i 1 ity, that the numbersof those who go for long attachments must be relatively small.   Batthe main reason why we recommend greater emnhasis on shorter attach-ients is that we wish as many administrators as possible to gainthis experience     For example, the number of administrators who inthe course, of their work are involved with industry and commerce isvery large.   They need a direct knowledge they seldom acquire atsresent.   We agree with the Confederation of British Industry thatthe right time for this is often early in a civil servant&apos;s career -hence our recommendation for outside attachments during the graduatedtraining period.    But study-visits can also be valuable later,especially when a man moves into a new post and needs a directinsight into the field with which he will have to deal.    We recommendthat programmes of visits of this kind should be arranged with localgovernment, the nationalised industries, private industry and commerce on the widest practicable scale.3.   Visits of this kind should be related as far as possible to a civil servant &apos;s future field of work.    The Confederation of BritishIndustry put this well in their supplementary evidence:    &quot;We regardsystematic career-planning as essential if joint training experiencesand secondments are to make a real contribution to a man&apos;s careerand not simply be a more or less interesting break from his normalsork&quot;.   Attachments will lose the greater part of their value ifthey are not carefully related to the development of the individual^career,iO.  So far we have discussed only one side of the coin - outwardattachments and visits for civil servants.    We believe that the traffic should be two-way.    There is no need to insist thatinterchange should be on a head-for-head basis:    this would be far too restrictive.   But there should be a reasonable balance.
Experience shows that &quot;outsiders&quot; can settle down quickly in &quot;theService and make a r eal contribution: the 1965 scheme, discussedcin the Treasury&apos;s paper published in Volume h, Section IV, has beena success.   We believe that such inward movement can be no lessvaluable to those who come into the Service and to their employers,jie would point out also that the lack of knowledge and unstanding of the outside world for which we have criticised the Service has itsjiiiTor-image in the outside world     The public interest requires thatactive steps should be taken to reduce it.11,   It is for the Service and its partners outside to devise ways and means, of putting these proposals into effect.    We believe however,that a systematic effort is needed and that co-ordinating machinerysill be required to organize and give the necessary impetus to it.ie suggest that joint working parties with local government and with industry, private and nationalised, should be set up to agree on a method of approach and organize the practical details of a programmeof interchange.
PENSION ABHANGEMENT^ASD. EARLY RETIREMENT - 415In this appendix we develop a number of the recommendationsj on this subject made in Chapter 4s-(a) the extension of the pension scheme to cover temporary staffs(b) the preservation of pension rights on voluntarily leaving the Service for any other employment,(e) improvements in the arrangements for compulsory earlyretirement,(d) improved pensions for certain late entrants,lie also discuss three other topics:-(e). the question of a contributory pension scheme,If) the age of retirement,ig) the statutory basis of the pension scheme,ipenslons for temporary staffI   The Civil Service pension scheme, as embodied in the superannuation Act 1965, only provides pensions for established staff;temporary staff receive gratuities.    Some temporary staff arenevertheless pensionable under other schemes.   Certain categories,notably temporary members of the scientific classes, are in theFederated Superannuation System for Universities, and there are atimber of other schemes covering small numbers of civil servants.Bat the majority of the 124,000 temporary civil servants are notpensionable *),   The reason   for   this   is the historical link betweenestablishment (i.e. the granting of permanent status) andpensionability.   This may well have been appropriate when the &quot;fringe^if temporary staff use small ani when fewg if any, of them served fory length of time.   We think however that this link between[paraanencs      and pensicnability has now ctased to be appropriate.S&apos;hile we accept the need to employ   staff   onJa temporary basis,    it seems to us that a man or woman who has served fir five years or more in the Civil Service ought to earn apension for hiss or her service.   Steps haw already been taken tol*8al with those temporaries (and the R.T. art nit a few) who givelong service; these who are still serving gjf$.        sga of 60 and have^ jears of service behind them are automatically nominated for
I^ablishment and go made pensionable.   We think, however, that this^g not   a satisfactory way of dealing with the problem and we have,^refore recommended in Chapter I4. that all civil servants who havejerved for the necessary qualifying period should be equal in this respect1   Extending the scheme to cover temporary staff would involve 4 &quot;]:artain technical problems.   It wcuLd presumably be necessaryto make sure that their physical health at entry was not such as to impose anindue burden on the finances of the scheme. It would certainly ber cessary to. adjust the arrangements for redundancy^ since it would btsreasorBble to pay the ^nercus redundancy terms that, are now provided for membersle pension scheme to those who had expressly been engaged on a temporary basis. ThereIs also the question of the reckoning of temporary service renderedbefore the date of the change.   We are,,however, satisfied that theserobleas can be solved, and that they are matters  that it is right for us to leave for settlement by subsequent negotiation.Preservation of pension rights on voluntary leavingWe recommended in Chapter   k    that all civil servants who have served for an appropriate qualifying period should be able totransfer or preserve their pension rights on voluntarily leaving the Civil Service.There are already a number of arrangements permittingpreservation in these circumstances.   They include the follewing:-(a) There is a widespread system of transfer throughout thepublic sector.   A civil servant who moves, for example, tolocal government may taxe with him a transfer value whichensures that his pensionable service in the Civil Servicecounts in full as pensionable service in local government.(b) Any civil servant over 50 may retire prematurely and receivethe pension and lump sum  that, he had earned prier to leavingwhen he reaches his official retiring age (this is-generally known aa a &quot;frozen&quot; pension).(c) There is also a system of &quot;approved employment**, whereby a civil servant who leaves for such employment may similarlyfreeze his pension rights and receive them en retirementfrom that employment (or from a subsequent approvedemployment).   Approval is generally limited to public orquaai-publio employments at home or^roafi, but since 1961*.
civil servants of Assistant Secretary rank (or equivalent)and above have been allowed to leave on approved employmentterms for any occupation they may choose. 417fflis amounts to quite a wide area of freedom..     But it is far from complete.    Most moves into private employment are not covered.Civil servants under 50 and below the rank of Assistant Secretarycannot have their pension rights frozen on moving to industry orcommerces, and there are no transfer arrangements at any level withthe private sector*],   The overwhelming weight of the evidence submitted to us was infavour of full freedom in respect of pension rights.     Informedopinion generally in this country has come to regard a pension not as a reward for a life-time of faithful services, hut as a kind ofadditional remuneration which should be attached to any period ofemployment of a reasonable length, whether it ends in retirementon the ground of age or not.     The Minister of Labour&apos;s national joint Advisory Council has recommended in favour of the generalpreservation of pension rights on voluntary leaving.     The national insurance retirement pension scheme has preservation built into it -a point which will have added importance when earnings - related benefits bring larger National Insurance pensions for higher-paid workers.    We have no doubt that preservation is the right principle for the public service.     This is partly in order to promote mobility.More generally* we think that the idea of a tied pension nowadaysreduces the attractiveness of the Civil Service for the potentialrecruit j not so much because he is actively concerned about hisultimate pension while still In his early twentiess as because itcontributes to a more general feeling that to enter t&amp;e CivilService is to commit yourself to it for life.     One of the findings of the survey of student attitudes which we reproduce in Volume 3Ho. 9, was that transferabillty was regarded as the most important feature of pension schemes by 71^ of the students who had acceptedor intended to accept offers of employments    We recommend therefore that civil servants of all ranks should in future be able to preserve their pension rights on leaving for other employment of any kind.
have used two terms, &quot;transferability&quot; (meaning the transfer/IPLpension rights to a new pension scheme) and &quot;preservation&quot; &apos; &apos;jeaning their storage towards an ultimate pension from the originallesion scheme). The distinction involves a point of substance.   TheIjority of pension schemes (and all public sector schemes) relate the8Vel of the pension in one way or another to the salary earnedgiediately before retirement;    the Civil Service pension for example3one-eightieth of the average salary over the last three years ofjrvice for each year of reckonable service (with a lump sum calculateda a similar basis).   If therefore a man&apos;s pension rights arejransferred to a new scheme so that his separate periods of serviceire aggregated for the purpose of calculating his final pension,liose rights will grow in accordance with his subsequent earnings injs new employment.   The combined effects of promotion and inflationire such as to make these rights much more valuable than they would save been if they had simply been frozen in the old scheme.We therefore recommend that the Civil Service should adoptie principle of making full transfer arrangements with privatelens ion schemes wherever this is practicable.   We also regard thisai an important aid to movement into the Civil Service, for thereasons set out in Chapter k paragraph 13k. We recognise, however,that this will be a slow business.   Because pension schemes varyIdely in their rates of benefit and accrual, no short cuts havelet been devised   that might make it unnecessary to negotiateseparate transfer arrangements with each individual pension scheme,h addition, therefore, we recommend that in general a frozen pension should be awarded on voluntary leaving in cases where a more satis-factory transfer arrangement had not yet been made,h There are two further aspects of preservation that needxaaination?    the period of service necessary to qualify for alesion and whether preservation should be as of right.   The presentalifying period in the Civil Service is, ten years (though a transferfalue a ay be paid after only one year) .   It would be cumbersome andto have to provide for very large numbers of tiny frozen
4:.gr)8ions for one or two years service, which in many cases wouldj0t amount to more than a few pounds, and we think that the concept,f a qualifying period i-s sound.   There is however a strong case for reducing it from ten years to five.   We think that in a number ofjgaes the optimum length of a a an&apos;a employment in the Civil Servicejay well fall between five and ten years, and that if periods ofI this length remain unpensionable they will not be attractive.   Worecommend accordingly that five years should be substituted as the qualifying period both for a frozen pension and (because they areInseparable) for a pension on final retirementsU, Preservation as of right is more difficult *   Under the pensionlegislation as it stands, no civil servant has a legal right to his pension; . he cannot sue the Crown for it.   The legislation is there-fore couched in discretionary rather than in mandatory terms,but it has long been the policy that pensions should not be stoppedor reduced below the maximum payable unless there is specific provision for this.   In tli s sense Civil Service pensions are paidautomatically.   &quot;Approved employment&quot; however is subject to thedecision of management and transfer values are Occasionally refused,e,g. where the civil servant transfer simply in order to avoid anuncongenial posting.   Similarly, cases could arise under full preser-vation in which a civil servant left &quot;voluntarily&quot; in order to anticipate dismissal for culpable misconduct.   We think therefore thatthe management should retain reserve powers to deal with such cases,though they should be used very sparingly and not, for example, asa penalty because resignation causes inconvenience to the department.12,  It has been represented to us that there are two risks.   Thefirst is that our proposals may lead to an exodus of scarce, skilledstaff, especially perhaps of those who have acquired in the Service a professional skill that is readily marketable outside.   The areaof risk however is limited, because senior civil servants and all those over 50 can preserve their pension rights already.   More%ortant, we are clear that the staffing problems of thsWvil Service should be overcome not by
Lposing restrictions upon pension rights hut by positive stepsIjjjf will make people willing to enter and remain in the Service.^ second risk is that if the Civil Service runs too far ahead ofjdinerce and industry in providing for preservation, it will handicapitself in the labour market: civil servants who can preserve theirtension rights will go to business but businessmen who cannot will:ot come into the Civil Service.    This argument does not apply totransfer arrangements, which have so far been and should remainreciprocal.   There is something in it as regards frozen pensions.    Butlit cannot be regarded as decisive.    The general tide is running inthe direction of preservation, and this is an area in which thegovernment as employer should be prepared to give a lead.   The termsIs have suggested are what seem&apos;to us appropriate in the light ofthe practice of the best employers today.    They should be kept up toSate as conditions change.Compulsory early retirement13, We have recommended that there should be wider powers to retireon pension those who have ceased to give satisfactory performance andwho ought to leave before their time in the interests of the Service.In the Civil Service, as in all employments,. occasions arise when itis necessary for management to cause to retire early those whoare inefficient or otherwise not up to standard.     When theInefficiency is culpable, for example when it arises frompersistent laziness or misconduct meriting dismissal, no special problems arise.     But those cases in which downright dismissal with&quot;the total or partial loss of pension rights is too severe a penalty,tod still more those in which no particular blame attaches to theindividual, e.g. if he has prematurely &quot;run out of steam&quot;, producenotorious problems for management    in all walks of life,tyi  In the Civil Service the problem is made more acute by two factors.    First,, the permanent civil servant has in practice
8 considerable security of tenure.   We discussed this in ChapterL in general, there are good reasons for it.   But it makes it1 a0re difficult, because more conspicuous, to remove those whoseperformance is unsatisfactory.   Secondly, as we have said in chapter I, the pace of change in the work of the Civil service has been fast in recent years &quot;and this is likely to continue.The pressure of work, especially on senior civil servants, hasbeen and seems likely to continue to be very severe.   particularly at such a time, it must be expected that some will lose their&quot;cutting edge&quot; before they reach the age of 60.   It is sometimespossible quite properly to find them another job within the Service(here the demands for speed and adaptability are not so great.     Butthere remain cases,where no?B of these expedients is open, in which it is necessaryin the public interest to retire men and women before their time.15.   The Superannuation Act contains a number of powers to deal withthis situation.   Under Section 10 of the Act a civil servant overthe age of 50 may be prematurely retired for inefficiency with theimmediate payment of the pension earned by his service.   Undersection 9 an immediate pension may also be awarded if he is under theage of 50^ but in that event the Treasury must lay a Minute beforeParliament setting out the reasons for the award.   Finally, section*5, which applies only to the Diplomatic Service, provides that anofficer may be retired prematurely with an immediate pension if thisis considered desirable in the public interest, having regard to hisqualifications and the conditions existing in the Service.   Section45 permits early retirement whether or not the officer concerned is personally inefficient; it also empowers the Treasury to grant anenhanced pension in; suitable cases.   The numbers retired under sections 9, 10 and 45 over the last 15 years are shown in Volume lijso16.  We think that these arrangements need to be improved in two
First, there is now in our view no good reason for theiiitinction between section 10 and section 9.   We should like tojee section 10 extended to all civil servants and section 9 abolished.If a Minute has to he laid before Parliament setting out the nameof the person concerned and the reasons why, despite his shortcomings,the Treasury feel able to grant him a pension, this inevitablyattaches a public stigma to the retirement, and we suspect that departments go to greater lengths than they should to keepinefficient employees rather than put them to this humiliation; the relatively small numbers of retirements in this category nw bear this out.The procedures which have been established for the operation ofsection 10 seem to us perfectly adequate for the proper protectionof individuals under 50 as well as those who have passed that age,and we recommend that the age limitation to section 10 should beremoved.   We note, incidentally, that this age limitation is thesame as that which has hitherto limited the right to retire with afrozen pension, and it seems wholly appropriate that both shoulddisappear together.17.   Secondly, however, we are not satisfied that section 10, asit is now operated, is adequate in modern conditions to deal with those officers who, though not  technicaHy&apos;hnefficient&quot;,have ceased to be able togive a satisfactory performance.   As it is drafted, section 10covers much the same ground as section us and implies the use of very similar criteria.   If anything, the words &quot;in the interests of efficiency&quot; in section 10 are wider in scope than those in section*5 &quot;desirable in the public interest, having regard to [an officer &apos;s]qualifications and the conditions existing in the Service&quot;.   Inpractice, however, section 10 has not been used in the home CivilService for the same purposes as section us in the diplomatic service.   It was apparently never intended that it should be usedexcept in cases of proved personal inefficiency, and assurancesnave been given to the National Staff Side to that effect.   It seeas^ us that this interpretation is too narrow, and that as a result theHome Civil Service is in a worse position than the Diplomatic Service,
jhich is able to remove those who have failed to develop their        4p3potential or whose powers have fallen away unexpectedly early.18, We do not think however that it is either necessary or practicablejjto apply section h5 to the whole of the Home Civil Service.      It is unnecessary because these more extensive powers are not needed forsanagement purposes at all levels of the Civil Service.     At lesssenior levels there is enough variety of work for it to be possibleto find useful employment for those of limited capacity without detriment to the efficiency of  the Service as a whole.      It is impracticable because the Service is  too large to ensure a commonstandard of administration throughout all its many establishments.3y the nature of the case, what is involved here is not a measure of personal inefficiency  that   is plainly recognisable as impairing the effective working of the department or branch.      It is something agood deal more subtle, and those at the top of a department who areto take action upon it need to know the person concerned and hislimitations well if they are to act both justly towards him andirisely in the public interest.19.  We recommend therefore that a procedure analogous to that provided for in section U.5 should be introduced for the senior ranksthe Service only, i .e. for those whose pay is above the maximum of the Administrative Class Principal.We leave the exact procedure to be settled later.     We thinkhowever that there should be adequate safeguards against unfairreatment;    it should not become possible to get rid of a man simply because he is an awkward colleague or subordinate.     We suggesttherefore that there should be provision for appeal to a board, on whichthe chairman and some of the members should be independent&quot;outsiders&quot;&apos; of standing.      It is also important in our view that thePerson concerned should be given the maximum amount of warning.     Heshould be told privately as far ahead as possible that he is beingconsidered for retirement under this procedure, which will be invokedhis performance does not improve.     As soon as it is decided towoke it, he should be informed.     When the decision to retire him isCached, he should except in cases of real urgency be given a long
-    424I,efiod of notice (say nine months to a year) in which to make hisnjrangements and prepare the ground for his forthcoming retirement.pt we have considered whether there should he provision forchancing  the pension or lump    sum in these circumstances, asjdere is in the Diplomatic Service.     There are arguments against it.Snhancement would mean providing a larger award than is granted injases of ill health, and it is not clear that a person who exjypothesi has not performed entirely satisfactorily should receivejore than a person whose retirement owes nothing to this cause.     on balance however, we have concluded that a measure of enhancement wouldce right.   &apos; Unlike the retirement for ill health, this is a deliberateset of management.      It may w ell be that no blame of any kind attaches;o the individual;    on the contrary he may have worn himself out inthe work of the Service.      It seems fair that if, as we propose, thelost senior civil servants are to be more liable to removal than theirjuniors, there should be provision for compensation.     The form andlevel of this compensation we leave to be settled later.22.  We draw attention to one other matter in this general field.Occasions may arise, perhaps especially at the lower levels of theService, when it is preferable to demote a person rather than retireaim, especially if he is nearing the end of his working life andunlikely to be able to get another job, but departments may be reluctant to do so because of the reduction of his pension that will follow.     Similar considerations may arise if a man has to be moveddown because he no longer satisfies the physical requirements of aspecialist job e.g. in air traffic control.      Such cases might beset more easily if the pensions were based not on the average salary&quot;ver the last three years of service, but on the average salaryover the last three years during which his salary was at itshighest; (for convenience in record-keeping, this might be made thepest three years in the last ten).     Normally this will be the last three years, but where it is not, it seems reasonable that theretiring civil servant should have the benefit of his peak earnings,recommend that this possibility should be examined.
mIuestion of, a,;;iontrib32tor.vi jpenslon scheme the present civil  Service pension scheme is non-contributory,jjave considered whether it should be put on to a contributory basis.^swas recommended by the Tomlin  Commissions 1929-1931. but has(j8Ter been proceeded with* 425j,,    It would make a marginal contribution to mobility.   The fullreservation which we have recommended is practicable whether the pension scheme is contributory or not, and the importance of a contributorylasis in this connection is therefore subsidiary.     It could howeverjroduce two additional benefits. -(a) the option of a return of contributions instead of transferor preservation for those who left before reaching theretiring age but after serving for long enough to qualify. for a pension (five years,, as we propose)j(b) the return of their contributions to those who had notserved for long enough to qualify for a pensionsthere is no strong reason to encourage (a) .   The object of pension schemes is to provide against final retirement, not to produce lumpsums in mid-career; and the return of an employee&apos;s contributions, evenfrith interest, is much less valuable than even a frozen pension, which includes the much larger contributions made by the employer.     On theother hand we see no reason why the State should behave more paternallytowards its employees than other good employers by maintaining a pension scheme  thartr does not permit voluntary leavers to encash their pension rights if they wish;   and we do not therefore wish to preserve thenon-contributory basis as a means of protecting civil servants against their own wrong decisions.    The main point however is that at (b)above.  While we think that a minimum qualifying period of five years1b reasonable, and necessary for the economical running of the pension scheme, it is undesirable that no provision at all should be made for those who serve for shorter periods *   Some, perhaps a high proportion,of those who come into the Service for short periods may stay for lessthan five years.   Not all of them will be able to transfer pension rights in and out or maintain their membership of previous schemes.   this problem could be dealt with in a non-contributory scheme by a system of short-service gratuities on the lines of that which now applies to temporary staff.     If this solution were adapted, we think that such
gratuities should be paid to all staff (temporary or permanent),for whom other pension arrangements had not been made, leavingafter two completed years of service.    We are however inclined tothink that this purpose could be better served by making thescheme contributory, and giving those who left without qualifying for a pension a right to the return of their own contributions.25,   This is because we attach importance to the less tangibleadvantages of a contributory scheme.   First, if a man payscontributions towards the cost of his pension, this helps him to fethat he is a partner in the process of providing for his retirementand hence that he is more in control of his future.     He mayrecognise that if he left the Service it would not pay him totake a return of his own contributions, but he may neverthelessfeel a sense of satisfaction that this is his own decision and not that of a paternal employer.   Secondly, a contributoryscheme can help tobuildof the right relationship between management and staff over the rules and provisions of the scheme.   We haveno criticism to make of the consultation that now takes place onthese matters.   But we think it would be better if the position ofthe staff in these consultations were based on the fact that theywere contributing to the cost, and might have to help to financeimprovements.   This is already true of the Civil Service Widows1and Children&apos;s Scheme, which is contributory.   We note moreoverthat the majority of private sector schemes are contributory,and that the same is true of the nationalised industries and most other public services.    It would in our view besurprising if the reasons for this general practice did notequally apply to the Civil Service.26.   We are therefore greatly in favour of a change-e^-e^ toa contributory basis.    We are not however in a position to examinethe practical implications of such a change at the present time.It may be that the additional administrative effort involved incollecting and recording contributions would be heavy, especially if the forthcoming introduction of National Insurance pensions
related to earnings necessitated new and more complicated arrangement to combine National Insurance and Civil Service pensions.     Werecommend that  the feasibility of the change should be examined as quickly as possible, and that the scheme should be put on to a contributory basis unless the practical difficulties prove to be over-riding. M        4 27Improved pensions for short service27.   The Civil Service pension scheme, like many others, provides afull pension after kO years service? the pension accrues in the waydescribed in paragraph 8 above and shorter periods earn smallerpensions pro rata.   We have no quarrel with this as a general principle; if a man$ for example, serves two employers for 20 yearseach, it is right that each should make provision forhis pension.     As a nation-wide system of preservation and transfer of pensions develops, it should eventually be possible forI a man who changes his job to accumulate as good a total income in retirement as he would have earned by remaining with one employerall his life.   This situation however does not exist yet, and aman or woman who enters the Service in middle age and is unableto transfer his pension rights, or perhaps has none to transfer,mayend up with an inadequate pension.   Private employers have at their disposal a number of expedients for dealing with this problem.The Inland Revenue permit full pension to accrue after 20 years,many pension schemes permit an employee who enters late to purchase&quot;added years&quot; for pension, and &quot;top-hat&quot; schemes are increasinglyI used to improve the pensions of highly-placed individuals.  In ourview, the Civil Service is badly placed to compete for high talentin this regard.   The Superannuation Act provides one method of granting &quot;added years&quot;, but it is too inflexible and only rarelyused.28.   We consider therefore that the existing &quot;added years&quot;provision should be replaced by a power that   can be flexibly8Pplied to provide late entrants with a pension that  accruesat whatever rate is appropriate in each individual case (any1 listing pension provision from his previous employment being
lien Into account) up to a maximum rate falling within the rules set the Inland Revenue,.    The appropriate arrangements should be madethe individual first enters the Service and should constitute    /QQjrt of the offer   of employment made to him.     It is not however, inview, necessary or desirable that arrangements of this kind, whichexpensive, should apply to all who enter the Service too late to dofull kO years&apos; work;    they should be restricted to those individualshigh quality whom the Service wishes to recruit directly to positionsresponsibility and who could not be attracted unless special^visions for pensions were made.^retiring agej, Formally, the minimum age of retirement is 60 (exceptions are madesallow certain classes,, e.g. prison officers, to retire on immediateension at an earlier age) .     In practice the highest ranks normally*tire at 60;   but the majority of civil servants work on after reachingmany to 65 and a substantial number beyond that age.     There areiliely-used arrangements under which officers can retire formally at 60:ut work on in a temporary capacity, often in a lower grade.,   We have at received evidence on this matter, and make no recommendation foriange.    We think however that determining the right retiring age is aniiportant and complex problem to which the Service should pay continuingMention in the light of current research and national policieswards retirement.!ae statutory basis of the pension scheme the details of Civil Service superannuation are embodied in Acts oflarliament and in statutory regulations made under the Acts,     This meanstot all changes in the scheme require legislation and that many quiteBall changes Involve not subordinate legislation but a separate Bill.Is a result, these changes have to wait for parliamentary time.   In^sequence, it may be several years before an agreed change can beIntroduced.   We think this to be an unnecessary complication, besides^ting parliamentary time.    We do not dispute that Parliament shouldttercise a proper control over this large element of staff expenditure.ht it seems to us that ways could be found of ensuring this that wouldM enable changes In the pension scheme to be made more promptly and&apos;ith lease fuss.    We recommend that they should be looked for.
THE WORKING ENVIRONMENTvVe mean &quot;by &quot;working environment&quot; first, the physical conditionsin which civil servants work, and secondly, the office services onwhich they can draw to deal with their work quickly and efficiently.IVe have received a paper from the Ministry of Public Building and works (Volume h, Section VIII) on government office accommodation and a paper from the Treasury on the adequacy of the provision of office machines (Volume 1+, Section VIII).   The report of theManagement Consultancy Group also commented on these things (Volume 2,para graphs 277-279).2.     In our view, the Civil Service tends to under-es legitimate theimportance of the working environment.    Thrift in these mattersis wholly creditable, but parsimony is damaging.   We have formed the impression that the Civil Service makes too much of a virtue ofausterity, and in some ways has allowed it to develop to the point at which the reputation and efficiency of the Service suffers from it.Physical Conditions3,     Several outside witnesses have commented on the generally shabbyimpression given by many government offices .   We agree with themthat the effect is often dispiriting, and we find it hard to believethat it has no effect both on potential recruits to the Serviceand on those who do their daily work in these surroundings.U.    Clearly, there can be no early solution to the problem of oldbuildings, discussed in the paper submitted by the Ministry ofPublic Building and Works.    A programme of replacing those thatare no longer adequate is under way.   We have not attempted to forma judgement on whether it is going ahead with the greatestjustifiable speed.   We do not however think that enough is doneon the maintenance of the older buildings.   More could be doneby better cleaning and more frequent painting to make them reasonablyPleasant to work in.5.    In particular, it is essential to provide better lavatoriesand washroom facilities.   Some of those which we have used ourselves
H &apos;K* if in the course of the last two years have been below any tolerablestandard, and we note without surprise that the same thing struckour Management Consultancy Group (paragraph 277 of their report).Lavatories and washrooms are frequently dirty and without towels andsoap.     This is unhygienic.    It is also absurd to see officials(including sometimes -Permanent Secretaries) keeping their personaltowels and soap in a drawer of their desk and walking the corridorsjfith them.   Responsible management includes good housekeeping,secretarial services,    Inadequate services waste skilled manpower higher up.    Ifhighly-paid staff have to spend time getting their own telephonecalls or cannot get urgent work typed quickly, the Service incursserious costs in frustration and inefficiency.    The top levels ofthe Service are well served.   But the secretarial and other services on which the middle ranks can call are often seriouslyinadequate.    We realise that there is a serious shortage of typistsin London and that it will probably continue to be necessary to s endmuch typing work to typing pools in the provinces.    But we think thatthe situation could be improved by the more systematic use ofdictating machines and by experimenting with different systems forthe pay of typists.    The Civil Service puts itself at an unnecessary disadvantage in the competition for typists by basingtheir pay on long salary-scales, which are appropriate to a person who is s tat ting a life-time &apos;s career in the Civil Service, butmuch less so to people whose turnover is expected to be rapid.We are aware that efforts have been made to improve the position.But the basic typist Grade II, for example, is recruited on a pay-scale which is too long - no less than fourteen annual steps.   the top rate is reasonable.    But because the scale is so long, the starting rate is unattractive.   We have not examined the problems involved in combining pay-scales that are suitable for girls who wanta career in the Civil Service with scales appropriate for thosewho would prefer a short-term contract.   But we are clear that something on these lines is needed.7.    Staff at the level of Assistant Secretary and above have
personal secretaries.   But those below generally do not, and many,especially among the specialists, find that their work is seriouslyheld up by the lack of clerical support and routine office help.This wastes their time.   The provision of personal assistants isnot necessarily the right solution; it can be very wasteful wherethey are not fully employed.    But shared and c entral facilitiesvcould be extended with great advantage.   Their availability shouldnot necessarily be determined by reference to rank; the criterionshould be - the needs of the work at any level.8.    We have seen that the Service is by no means backward in trying out and providing the most modern office machines.    It is however less good at making their existence and advantages knownto those who could make good use of them.   We think also thatthere is a good deal of scope for the wider use of the simpleraids such as ready-reckoners and adding machines.   Too manycalculations are still done in longhand.   Our Management ConsultancyGroup also found that complicated procedures were needed to acquiresuch small items as pens and erasers.   We hope that the expandedmanagement services units which we have proposed in Chapter 5 will,as a minor by-product, ensure that such simple obstacles to efficiency are speedily removed.
APPENDIX J 432THE SUPPORTING GRADESThe majority of civil servants are in the supporting gradesichfall predominantly at the lower end of the pay structure.    TheyIare of the greatest importance to the efficient discharge of the tasks of the Service.    There are about 112,000 in the general and departmental Clerical Classes, 67,000 in the Clerical Assistant Glass,28,000 in the Typing grades, 26,000 in the Officer Keeper, Messengerand analogous grades and k.8,000 in the Ancillary Technical grades -a total of 280,000 which represents over 60% of the whole non-1 industrial Civil Service.2,    He recommended in Chapter 6 that all classes should be abolished and replaced by a single, unified grading structure covering the1 stole Service.    In the course of the examination that led us tothis conclusion, we considered whether the problems of the supportinggrades were such that we ought to recommend for them a different and special solution.    We concluded, however, that the case for a unifiedI grading structure applied to these as well as to the other levels of the service.\\.    In these areas of the Service, as elsewhere, there are a great number of separate classes, again divided both horizontally andvertically.    For example, there are upper and lower ReproductionClasses, &apos;A&apos; comprising craftsmen and *B&apos;semi-skilled workers.    Thereare separate classes side by side for reproduction (maps), photo-printers, duplicator operators (stencils, offset-litho etc.) and machine operators (calculating machines, punched cards etc.)   Thereare separate classes again for office keepers, paperkeepers andmessengers, and there are also separate classes for ClericalOfficers and Clerical Assistants.   The problems posed by this largelumber of separate classes, many with their own separate careerstructures, are as we have set out in Chapter 6.5*    We received evidence from the Treasury (Volume 5. No. 11) andfrom the Civil Service Union, the Civil Service Clerical Association,
-.    433;he Society of Technical Civil Servants, the Association ofjovernment Supervisors and Radio Operators, the Inland Revenue Staff?federation, the Customs and Excise Launch Service Association and thellinistry of Labour Staff Association on the classes they representilthin this area of the Service (Volume 5, nos .27, 22, 1+9, 19, 35,32 and 1+6).   Among the main points they severally put to us were: -(a) Promotion prospects should be improved by: -(i) the creation of higher posts within the fields nowcovered by these classes (the C.S.U., the society of Technical Civil Servants and A. G. d.R .0 . ) .In particular new supervisory grades for Tracers and DrawingOffice Assistants should be created to provide a career for those who are unlikely to rise above their present field;higher supervisory grades should be introduced for the specialised management of stores and reproduction work; anda new grade of   Employment Officer should be introduced inthe Ministry of Labour.(ii) larger promotion outlets, to   higher   classes.(b) The Reproduction Classes should be merged and there shouldalso be a merger between the Radio Technicians (who are represented by the C.S.U. and A.G.S.R.O.) and the telecommunications Technical Officers (who are represented by the Institution of Professional Civil Servants).(c) Many jobs at present graded as industrial should be regradedas non-industrial: and a new class should be created to make possible a continuous grading structure for those who workin electronics .(d) There should be a review of the structure of the Typing,Duplicating and Machine Operator classes; as regards thelatter it was suggested that the Machine Assistant should become a training grade, and Machine Operator the mainworking grade,with pay geared to proficiency.(e) Incremental scales should be shortened to enable the newentrant to reach his maximum sooner, while long-serviceincrements at periodic Intervals should be introduced forunpromoted officers who have reached their salary maximum.
(j(    in our view the main problems exposed by this evidence springfrom the rigidities and inflexibilities associated with the structure of classes which we have condemned in Chapter 6.   They cannot therefore, be solved without the abolition of these separate classes and their incorporation within the unified grading structure we have recommended.     This will provide the essential framework for thegreater flexibility in organisation and deployment that is vital tomanagerial efficiency in this area of work;    it will also providebetter career opportunities; we believe these to be unduly restricted by the present arrangements .7,    At the same time, the supporting grades pose a special problem.,,e would expect the development of mechanisation and especially of computers greatly to change the nature of their work in the comingyears,   This change will not come suddenly.    But its effect will beto make personnel management much more important at these levels.The main need, as the evidence shows, is that there should be an openroute to promotion to work of higher responsibility.8.    Departments will accordingly need to give more attention to this.It is not only a question of selecting those men and women who are capable of filling posts of greater responsibility within their ownfields; it also means that departments should make special efforts to select and train those who wish and have the aptitude to move toother types of work that   offer new prospects and opportunities.9.    In paragraph 2h3 of Chapter 6 w recommend as a first prioritythat the Civil Service Department should mount a major study to workout the precise details of a unified grading structure to be appliedthroughout the Service.    We would expect this study to pay particular attention to the likely impact of much more extensive mechanisationof the work at these levels in the Service.
APPENDIX KMAIN EVIDENCE ON IMPORTANT TOPICSWe refer briefly in this Appendix to those pieces ofbitten evidence, published in Volume 5. that made an especiallypositive contribution to our work.   We have perforce been highlyselective.    On some questions, for example the structure of theService, a few papers have dealt thoroughly with the subject while others have referred to it much more briefly; here we refer to theformer only.     On others, there has been a great deal of evidence,no part of which however stands out as a full-scale treatment ofthe subject.   An example of this is the need for greater mobilitybetween the Service and the outside world, and the case for preservingpension rights on voluntary leaving - a point made verywidely indeed.    In these cases, we give a few examples, simply to illustrate the general scope and weight of the opinion put to us.2.    We have included no references to oral evidence.   As weexplain in Appendix 1, we decided to take all oral evidence in confidence.     A list of those who came to talk with us is at/Annex II
Hjjex   II to that appendix.ji  we have also confined our references to those papers thatMjntained proposals and comments, i.e. those published in.fllunie 5.   We have also been greatly influenced by the reports of investigations and the factual material contained in Volumes 2, 3 and but their scope is too wide for us to attempt to summarise the mare.Bjfucture of the Civil service   H. M. Treasury (Volume 5, No, 1) proposed the merger of theadministrative and Executive Classes and the formation of an integrated structure at the top of the Service down to the salaryjpvel of the maximum of the Assistant Secretary scale.   The mainnepers on structure took this as their starting-point.   As was nojoubt to be expected, the main evidence came from inside the Service;at side organizations and individuals for the most part made onlyirief references to it.   The Civil Service Clerical Association(So.22) proposed the addition of the Clerical Classes to thelerger proposed by the Treasury; the Treasury (N.o.2) agreed.    TheInstitution of Professional Civil Servants 0J.o.38) proposed similarsergers of the Scientific and of the Professional (works Group)     andTechnical Classes into a Science Group and a Technology Grouprespectively; and later (No.39) the creation of a Social Scientist3roup,   The Treasury disagreed (Nos. 5 to 8 and 40). The I.P.C.S. also proposed that the integrated structure at the top of the Service shouldoe extended downwards to the maximum of the Principal scale.     TheFirst Division Association (Ho. 15) supported the merger of theAdministrative and Executive Classes, but opposed the integratedtop structure.   Other staff associations made proposals relating totheir particular parts of the Service.    Those representingdepartmental classes were for the most part strongly in favour of theis?preservation.   The Treasury, the Ministry of Public Building andforks and the Ministry of Technology exposed the problems that arise from the present groupings of scientists and engineers in separate
classes (No.7).

Recruitment

5. The Treasury proposed a wider graduate entry to administrative work (Volume 5, No.1). The Civil Service Commission described present procedures and suggested a method of selection for a wider graduate entry (Volume 4, Section III). Mr. J. H. T. Goldsmith proposed an alternative (Volume 5, No.126). Other papers which discussed administrative recruitment at some length were submitted by the First Division Association (No.15), the Society of Civil Servants (No.47), Professor B. Crick and Mr. W. Thornhill (No.120), Mr. N. Johnson (No.133), Mr. J. H. Robertson (No.143) and Mr. F. Stacey (No.151). Problems of recruitment to the Clerical Classes were discussed by the Civil Service Clerical Association (No.22).

6. Recruitment to the specialist classes was discussed by the Treasury in its papers about the Scientific Classes (No.5), the Works Group (No.6), the Economist, Statistician and Research Officer Classes (No.8), Accountants (No.9) and the Legal Class (No. 10). The Institution of Professional Civil Servants (No.38), the First Division Association (No.15), the Society of Technical Civil Servants (No.49) and the Civil Service legal Society (No.26) commented on recruitment to the classes they represent. We were also assisted by papers contributed by the Council of Engineering Institutions (No.72) and the Engineers Guild Ltd. (No.77) about engineers; and by the Accountants Joint Parliamentary Committee (Nos. 51 and 52) and the Institute of Cost and Works Accountants about accountants (No.89). General problems of recruitment were discussed in papers by schools (No.110) and by Youth Employment Officers (No. 117).

Training

7. Detailed proposals on management training were made in the Report of a Working Party under the chairmanship of Mr. S. P. Osmond (Volume 5, No.13). Vocational training for specialists was discussed by the Treasury (No.6) and the Institution of Professional Civil Servants (No.38). Professor P. J. O. Self (No.147) discussed in some detail the idea of a Civil Service College. This was also


proposed by the labour Party (No.97) and Mr. T. Smith (No.150). Management training for both administrators and specialists was also discussed by many staff associations and in a number of papers submitted by organisations and individuals outside the Service, notably by the Labour Party (No.97), the Liberal Party (No.98), the Council of Engineering Institutions (No.72), the Royal Institute of Public Administration (No.107) , Professor B. Crick and Mr. W. Thornhill (No.120), Mr. N. Johnson (No. 133), Mr. E. M&apos;Ewen (No.135) Professor Self (No.147) and Mr. F. Stacey (No.151).

Career management

8. The Greater specialisation of administrative staff was discussed by the Labour Party (Volume 5, No.97) the Royal Institute of Public Administration (No. 107), Mr. N. Johnson (No. 133), Professor Self (No.147) Mr. Deakin, Mr. Mayall and Mr. Plowden (No. 139) and a group of members of the First Division Association (No.128). The career management of staff in their early years occupied a substantial part of the evidence of several staff associations, notably the Society of Civil Servants (No.47) and the Civil Service Clerical Association (No.22). Many papers discussed movement between jobs and between Departments, for example those of National Coal Board (No.100), several Hospital Boards (Nos. 81-86), the British Railways Board (No.63), the Confederation of British Industry (No.67) and Dr. A. F. Earle (No.123). The need for the better career management of specialists was discussed by the Institution of Professional Civil Servants (No.38); many papers dealt with the need to give them experience of management work, for example those of the Council of Engineering Institutions (No.72), the Royal Institute of British Architects (No. 104), the Royal Society (No.108) and the British institute of Management (No.60). Several took the view that personnel work generally was in need of improvement and should be given a higher status within the Service. They included the Royal Institute of public Administration (No.107), the Confederation of British Industry (No.67) and the Institute of Personnel Management (No.92).


ha nature and organisation of Civil Service work  the need for clear allocation of responsibility and authority,aa discussed by the Society of British Aerospace Companies[Volume 5, No.ll3)* the Confederation of British Industry (No. 63)yid the Association of Municipal Corporations (No. 56).   Much ofthe evidence favoured the setting up of integrated hierarchies andiixed teams.    Examples are the papers submitted by the FirstDivision Association (No. 15) , the Institution of Professional CivilServants (No. 38) , the Liberal Party (No .98),the Council of EngineeringInstitutions (No. 72) and the Engineers Guild (No. 77).   Stress wasalso laid on new management techniques, e.g. by the BritishInstitute of Management (No. 60), the Electricity Council (No. 76),and on the need for internal efficiency audit, e.g. by Dr. A.F. Earle(No. 123).   Problems of interdepartmental consultation werementioned in a number of these papers, and also by Mr. P. Jay (No.132]Sr. W. S. Ryrie (No. 144) and Mr. J. H. Robertson (No. 143).Mr. Ryrie and Mr. Robertson also discussed the changing nature ofCivil Service work.   Mr. Robertson advocated the setting up of planning units, as did also Professor Self (No. 147) and Mr. D. Seers(No. 145).   The role of the Permanent Secretary came in for a gooddeal of attention: the papers by the Institution of ProfessionalCivil Servants (No. 38), the Greater London Council (No. 79)*Sir Donald Gibson (No. 125) and Mr. N. Johnson (No. 133) areexamples.   Some discussed the question of hiving off executive functions to autonomous bodies; they included the Confederation ofBritish Industry (No. 67), the Guardian (No. 80) and british european Airways (No. 59).Lcareer Service and mobility10.   There have been very few suggestions that the Civil service should cease to be a career service; very many that there should be&quot;ore mobility and better contacts between the Service and the outside world.    Some, e.g. the Confederation of British Industry(Volume 5, No. 69), Sir Frank Turnbull (No. 152) and Sir Donald5ibson (No.125), suggested that scientists and engineers in particular
aid have more mobile careers.   The importance of better contactsg stressed, for example, by the Trades Union Congress (No. 115)Electricity Council (No. 76), I.C.T. Ltd. (No. 95) and theater London Council (No. 79).   More late entry was widelycommended:    examples are the Confederation of British IndustriesSo. 67) j the Royal Society (No. 108), the British Institute ofjlanagement (No. 60) and Professor B. Crick and Mr. W. ThornhillNo. 120).   Interchange of staff is dealt with in Appendix Q.   Thisl;oo attracted very wide support from organisations and individualslla many different walks of life.   Joint training courses (whetherInside or outside the Service) were also favoured, e.g. by I.C.^.l;td.? (Ho. 95) the British Railways Board (No. 63) and the TradesIjaion Congress (No. 1.15).   As regards pension arrangements, thereras very wide support for, and no opposition to, preservation onroluntary leaving.   Several staff associations, the Royal Institutejjf Public Administration (No. 107) and the Institute of Personnel(anagement (No. 92) suggested pensions for temporary staff.Central management of the Civil ServiceII.  Lord Helsby, the t ten Head of the Civil Service, put in a personal paper (Volume 5, No. ih).   The general, but not unanimous,Right of opinion was in favour of a change, either to a PublicService Commission or to a new department.   Examples are the papersby the Labour Party (No. 97) , the Liberal Party (No. 98), theaajority of staff associations (but not the Institution of professional Civil Servants), the Royal Institute of public administration (No. 107) and the Trades Union Congress (No. 115) *Some of these also proposed the closer association of the Civilservice Commission with the central management;    so also, for example,did the Institute of Personnel Management (No. 92) and Mr. A. F.Saple (No. 123).kMlSIULja^hJlll^^ and Civil Sarv^anonymity&apos;2&apos;     Relations with Ministers were not widely discussed, but were dealt with by the Labour Party (Volume 5* No. 97), Mr. D. Seers(to. 1^5) and Sir A. Percival (No. 137).
j flie Labour Party were also in favour of a Ministerial &quot;cabinet&quot;1 on the French model.     A greater number preferred a looser ays tea10f ad hoc personal appointments.     The fullest treatment of thisLas in the paper by the Fabian Society (Np. 78).     It was alsoW1 discussed by the Liberal Party (No. 98), the Trades Union Congressj (No. 115). the Institution of Professional Civil Servants (No. 38)and Mr. T. Smith (No. 150).     Comment on the convention that civilservants should be anonymous has &quot;been wide-spread.     Most thought iti should be relaxed, for example the Liberal Party the ConsumerI Council (No. 71). Shell (No. 112), the First Division Association\ (No. 16), the Inland Revenue Staff Federation (No. 35),jr. N. Johnson (No. 133), Mr. A. F. Earle (No. 123) and professor Crick and Mr. Thornhill (No. 120).     Some of these warnedI of the difficulties;   so did Sir H. Poynton (No. 12+0).general 13.   On most points, there have been dissenting voices.     Butreviewing the evidence as a whole, we have been struck by aj remarkable consensus of opinion.     Many tributes have been paid to1j the strong qualities of the Civil Service.     At the same time, thereis a large measure of agreement on the major problems that now needI to be solved and on some of the reforms that should be introducedH for this purpose.
APPENDIX   L , . yPROCEDURE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSInvestigation and ResearchWe commissioned five investigations.    We wish to record ourdeep debt of gratitude to those who conducted them, many of whomdevoted a very great deal of time and trouble to this work, tothose who assisted them in various ways and&apos; to the individuals v*noco-operated so willingly by taking part in interviews and replying to questionnaires.   They have made a    most important contributionto our work and, we believe, to a general understanding of theCivil Service.(a)  Management Consultancy Investigation2.    This was an investigation on the ground of a number of blocks of work in government departments, selected to provide   as good across-section of the main kinds of work done by civil servants inthe general service classes as could be examined by a small teamI in a reasonably short time.    The investigation was carried out bya mixed group.   It was headed by a member of the Committee,Dr. Norman Hunt.    The other members of the team were Mr. JohnGarrett fea association successively with Mr. D. Morley-Pletcher and Dr. R.Ferguson) of Associated Industrial Consultants Limited, Mr . E..K. Fergus on ofthe British Petroleum Company Limited, whose services were made i  available to the Committee without charge over a long period, andMr. S.D. Walker of the Organisation and Methods I Division of thetreasury.   Twelve departments provided facilities for the examination of their work, the staff associations concernedencouraged tiheir members to co-operate, and nearly 600 individualcivil servants took part in interviews and helped in other ways.The report of the team is published simultaneously with our reportin Volume 2.(to)  Sociological SurveyI 5,    This was a survey by questionnaire designed to provide theoutline of a sociological portrait of the main general service
classes of the Civil Service.   It was conducted by Dr. A.H. Halsey,head of the Department of social and Administrative Studies at the university of Oxford, and Mr. I. M. Crewe, Assistant Lecturer in Politics at theUniversity of Lancaster.   The time available was too short to44 3allow for a pilot enquiry or any study by the interview method  1 f xjof opinions or attitude to work, and the survey had therefore tobe confined to factual information about the social and educationalbackground of the sample.    It will be published later in volume 3.!i,    Others who took part in this survey were the Government social survey, especially Mr. Louis Moss and Miss H.B. Lewin, who devotedmuch time- and labour to the preparation of-the material; H.M.Treasury, which prepared the sample and gave other help;Dr. M. Knott of the London School of Economics who helped withthe statistical side of the survey; Professor R.K. Kelsall ofSheffield University, who helped to design the shape of the survey;Professor Asa Briggs, Lord Heyworth, Professor W.J.M. Mackenzie,Sir Peter Runge, Sir Henry Wilson Smith, Dr. A.T.M. Wilson,Dr. E.G. Woodroofe and Mr. M. Zinkin, who read and commented onearly drafts; and   the individual civil servants who responded inoverwhelming,    majority to the questionnaire.(c)   Entrants to the Administrative Class in 19565.    Dr. R.A. Chapman of Liverpool University conducted a surveyby questionnaire and interview of those men and women who entered the Administrative Class as Assistant Principals in 1956.   Hissurvey is also published in Volume 3 under the title &quot;Profile ofa Profession&quot;,U)   Unsuccessful candidates for the Administrative Class in 19516.    Dr. J.F. Pickering of Sussex University conducted a surveyby questionnaire designed to examine the subsequent careers of candidates who had been unsuccessful in the open competitions forthe Administrative Class fifteen years before our own inquiry.His report is also published under the title &quot;The Civil ServiceUnsuccessfuls&quot; in Volume 3.

We have received a great volume of factual and statisticalasterial from the Treasury, the Civil Service Commission and otherdepartments.   This material has been an invaluable basis for our work.   We are publishing much the greater part of it in Volume ksimultaneously with our report, not only in order to show the(e) Administrative Class follow-up1,.   The Civil Service Commission, assisted by departments,conducted a follow-up survey of members of the Administrative Classto compare the relative progress and performance of different types of entrant and to check the validity of the selection procedure.Their report also is published in Volume 3.(f) Reports on the Civil Service since Northcote-Trevelyan8,    Mr. J.B. Bourn of the Ministry of Defence made a study of thework of the main Royal Commissions and committees   that have examined -the Civil Service. His account is also published in volume 3.&apos;9,    We also publish in Volume 3 reports resulting from otherenquiries which were not commissioned by us, and in the design ofwhich we took little or no part, but the results of which were madeavailable to us by their authors.   They are the following:-
facts onvhich we have feased our conclusions, but also in the        , . r4 4 bI belief that this information should be made public for its   - -I intrinsic interest and value.   We wishtto record our appreciation of the time and trouble that went into preapring it for us.Visits abroad11.   Groups of us visited Prance (November, 1966) and Sweden(February, 1967).   The Chairman and one other member also visited theIUnited States (September, 1966).   Our impressions of these visitsfare recorded in Appendix C. We cannot here record the names of allj those who did so much to help us, but we are deeply grateful to each government which acted as our host and took great trouble toIBake our visit to their country interesting and profitable,j Written evidencej 12.   We have received a great deal of written evidence.   It came-Ifrom many sources? from H.M. Treasury and other departments, from1 the Civil Service staff associations, from organisations outsidej the Civil Service (political parties, professional and learnedbodies, nationalised and-private industry, local authority associations and others), and from individuals both inside andI outside the Civil Service.   We think it right to publish much the1I greater part of this evidence, and it is appearing simultaneously1 nith our report in Volume 5.   A list of the organisations and1- individuals whose evidence is being published is at Annex I to this) appendix.; Oral evidencej 13.  Many of our 89 meetings were devoted to taking oral evidence.i h took the decision to take it all in confidence.   We did so inI the belief that we should best discharge our duty if we based our:j report on exchanges of views   that were as frank and informal asI possible, and not upon open statements of formal positions, which\ wist necessarily be msre reserved.   In consequence we are precluded\ from publishing this evidence.   A list of the organisations andi individuals who came to talk with us is at Annex II to this appendix.
llj,  We gratefully acknowledge the report of the Estimates Committee,which laid the f oundations for our work in its Sixth Report toParliament (1964-1965).Other acknowledgements15,   Our thanks are also due:-To the governing body of Exeter College, Oxford, who releasedDr. Norman Hunt from his many college duties for over a year sothat he could devote his whole time to our work.To Shell International Petroleum Company Limited, imperial chemical Industries Limited, Unilever Limited and Marks andSpencer Limited for information on their personnel managementpractice;To Barclays Bank Limited, Courtaulds Limited, Electric andMusical Industries Limited, Electricity Council, ElliotAutomation Limited, Pisons Limited, C.A.

We are also most grateful for the help of the typing andduplicating services of the Treasury.   They   met the heavy demandsreplaced upon themvith impressive speed and efficiency,general17.   The reports, the material and the evidence we are..publishinggive some indication of the amount of help we have received inthe course of our inquiry.   We metnlon in Appendix K thosecontributions that influenced our thinking on particular topics.Sere we wish to record our gratitude to those on whom we imposedthe greatest labours, especially the Management Consultancy Group,and Dr. Halsey and Mr. Crewe.We have also received a great deal of help, official and private,torn many civil servants in many departments.   We may perhaps mostsuitably thank them all, and particularly the Pay and ManagementGroup of the Treasury, in the person of Lord Helsby.   He put at&quot;ur disposal all the knowledge, wisdom and experience gathered
in the course of his distinguished career in the Civil Service,particularly over the last five years as its Head.   We are veryconscious of the load that   our work has placed on him and onhis colleagues, and are most grateful for all they have done.

LIST OF recommendations i TASKS OF THE MODERN CIVIL SERVICE AND THE MEN AND WOMEN THEYjgAND (CHAPTER 2)The Service should act more quickly to identify and recruit new:3ecia].ist skills that are needed.    It should allow specialists to,carry more responsibility responsibility than they do at present; the obstacles^venting them from reaching top management should be removed;sere should be a deliberate policy of training in administrationnd management for specialists who are to carry these greateresponsibilities (paragraphs 36 and 39).New principles should be applied to the selection, training andieployment of administrators: they must possess the basic concepts andal&amp;lge i&amp;gyant to   their area of administration (paragraph hi).),   The administrator should specialise, particularly in his early;ears, in an area of administration (paragraph h2).Administrative specialisation should be based on categorisationby subject-matter rather than by departments or groups of departments(paragraph hk).5.   V/e propose as a starting-point two broad groups of administrativejobs which provide a field for specialisation on the basis of theirsubject-matter: economic and. financial, and social, each with its own internal specialisms; this pattern should be reflected in thetraining and deployment of administrators (paragraphs us&quot;k7)-0.   Economic and financial administrators should, in addition totheir skill in administration, have appropriate qualifications,experience and training in such subjects as economics, finance,business administration and statistics, especially as applied toI government work; to their basic knowledge of their field theyshould add any further specialisation that particular areas ofgovernment work require (paragraph h.9).The deployment of economic and financial administrators shouldttot be limited to the main economic departments:  they should be^Ployed in any department in posts that are mainly financial orCOn-cerned with economic administration and management (paragraph u10).&apos;   There will be a continuing need in some departments for economic&quot;^financial administrators who have been specially trained to apply
jeir skills  to work of a high scientific and technological contentparagraph 50) .i(   Social administrators should have training and experience, iniiition to their administrative skills, in the social studies relevant3 modern government;  the emphasis should vary depending on thesocial area of government concerned (paragraph 51).;i,   Most social administrators should he concentrated in the mainocial departments, hut many should he employed throughout the:;rvice;  there will he jobs in the economic departments for whichi-scial administrators are needed (paragraph 51).;,  administrators should not replace those specialists whose-imary concern is the practice of their specialism (paragraph 52).),   It should be the task of the Civil Service Department toievelop and refine these groups and keep them up to dateparagraph 55).ji Some, both administrators and specialists^ should be encouragedispecialise and make  their careers in the kinds of work for whichaiy different kinds of background and experience can be appropriate,tcii as contracts, computers, 0. &amp; M., personnel (paragraph 56).jlRUITMENT, TRAINING AND CAREER MANAGEMENT (CHAPTER 5, APPENDIX E,JPSNDIX P)ft; responsibility for recruitmentf., Recruitment, training and career management should be asi-osely integrated as poss ib le; recruitment should be in the hands ofIpe who also share a direct responsibility for the individual^lisequent training, deployment and development (paragraph 62).I). The Civil Service Commission should cease to be a separate and-dependent organisation;  it should become part of a new GivilJ nice Department and its staff should be integrated with it: somefits functions should be shared with the &apos; employing departments:iPagraph 63).I&apos; The selection of recruits should be, and should be seen to be,impendent of any form of patronage (paragraph 6k).j&apos; Recruitment should be for specific ranges of jobs (paragraph 66).I&apos; Departments should have a greater influence on the selection ofJpiduals; a higher proportion of staff should be recruited direct
by departments; the employing departments should &quot;be betterrepresented in the central recruitment of staff (paragraph 67).Hecruitment procedures and the problems of delay19.    The procedures of formal competition should be restricted toposts for which there are many well-qualified candidates for asmall number of posts and even then it should be made possible tooffer outstanding candidates rapid appointment;, where it is inpractice certain that there will be posts for all suitable candidatesthey should be brought in without delay once it is clear that theyire up to the required standard (paragraph 69).The principles and methods of recruitment20.   Specialist staff should normally be recruited direct by theiepartment or establishment that is to employ them; recruitmentshould be by interview before a board, consisting of a majority fromthe employing department or establishment but including a kindred-necialist from outside the Service and a representative of theiivil Service Department (paragraph 73).11.   Non-graduate specialists should be recruited by similar:rocedures to those recommended for graduate specialists  (paragraph18),V2,   Of the non-specialist entry: -(a) bchool-leavers with &apos;A levels&apos; should continue for themost part to be recruited by the Civil Service Department,but departments should be associated closely with theprocess.(b) School-leavers with &apos;0 levels&apos; should continue to be recruited by individual departments (paragraph 88).3.   Representatives of departments should be in a majority on&quot;election boards, both central and departmental, they should bei&apos;&quot;imarily composed of men and women with a good many years to go;:fore retirement; (Appendix E, paragraph 12).*ii   In the recruitment of graduates etc. for administrative workp Service should aim to recruit those with the best qualifications,Etudes, qualities and experience for the jobs falling into one ofbroad categories of administration.    In the view of a majority
of the Committee this means that the relevance of graduates&apos;        ^s&quot;;/university studies to their future work should, he an importantqualification for recruitment to administrative posts  (paragraphsyi and 75).    Those appointed without- relevant qualifications shouldbe required to take either a special, additional training course at the Civil Service College or a relevant post-graduate degree orcourse of study at a university (paragraph 79).25.   Over the years an increasing importance should he attached tothe requirement that undergraduates seeking appointment to administrative posts should understand the use of numerical techniques and he able to apply quantitiative methods to the solution of theirproblems (paragraph 21).26.   Non-specialist graduates should be recruited centrally by theCivil Service Department (paragraph 82).27.   There should be two main methods of entry for non-specialistgraduates:  -(a) In the view of the majority, Method I should be retained ina modified form on a trial basis only.    The papers should be restricted entirely to  those with a direct relevance to theproblems of modern government.(b) Method II should involve a procedure based on that of thepresent Civil Service Selection Board, but with changes inthe procedure and staffing of the selection process(paragraph 82).28.   There should be an inquiry into the methods of selection toconsider ways of making the process of selection more objective in character, the problem of reducing the time taken by the selectionprocess, and the evidence of trends in recruitment (paragraphs 70 and83, Appendix B, paragraphs 21-2h).29.   Separate entry competitions should continue to be held forsuch groups as Tax Inspectors     and Ministry of Labour Cadets ,wherever they are found to be appropriate (paragraph 83).30.   Graduate recruits to both administrative and specialist posts wno
are judged outstandingly able and well-qualified :,n entry should be offered a starting salary two or three increments above the basicfor the entry grade (paragraph 86).31. The Service should not seek to employ more graduates than a vigorous analysis of the work shows to be necessary (Appendix F,paragraph 8).32.   Recruits with such qualifications as the H.N.C. or with  &apos;alevels&apos;  in scientific or technical subjects should normally be posted to jobs for which their qualifications are relevant.    for adminsitrative staff recruited at this level their   &apos;a-level&apos;qualifications may be pointers to the direction in which they snouldspecialise (paragraph 87).Late entrants and recruitment for short-term appointments33.   The prime factor in the appointment of late entrants should bethe relevance of the skills, qualifications and experience they already possess for the job or range of jobs in which it is proposed to employthem (paragraph 89).I The management of new entrants3h.   There should be a complete review of grading at the levels of clerical Assistant, Clerical Officer and Executive Officer to separateI the jobs appropriate to the older civil servant from those] appropriate to the young entrant who with training and experience shouldbe capable of rising higher in the Service (paragraph 93).I 35.   School-leaver recruits should be regarded as under training for the first three or four years; they should receive substantialinduction training;  they all should be carefully watched by personnel management; more specialised training should be provided as aptitudesland potential begin to emerge (paragraph 9^4-).I 36.   A training grade should be introduced &apos;for the graduate entry andfor those of the non-graduates who have shown the highest abilityI (paragraph 95).137.   when they leave the training grade trainees should go straightto the level justified by their performance, without regard to the1 claims of seniority (paragraph 96).
  f, 038.   A Civil Service College should be created (paragraph 99).       :39,   The College should provide major training courses in administration and management: -(a) courses for specialists who need training in administration and management;(b) post-entry training for graduates recruited for adminsitrative work;(c) additional courses in management for those in theirthirties and forties moving into top management;(d) refresher courses in the latest management techniques;(e) courses for the best of the school-leaver entry.Some of these courses should be wholly or partly residential(paragraph 100).1+0.   The College should provide a wide range of shorter courses in both general management and vocational subjects, for all levels ofstaff and particularly for the more junior; there should be a reviewof the balance between central and departmental training (paragraph101).l+l.   The College should have research functions (paragraph 102).1+2.   Major courses should be concentrated in a single establishmentclose to London; a non-residential centre in London will also be needed (paragraph 104).43.   Graduate trainees in the administrative groups should, after aninduction course, spend up to two years in their departments in jobsselected to test their ability and aptitudes and develop their capacity to take responsibility.   As many as possible should get theexperience of working at the places and at the levels at which theService meets and deals with individual members of the public(paragraph 106).hk,   Their main formal training should last up to one year, andshould consist mainly of: -(a) further training in the subject-matter of the variousadministrative groups;(b) the techniques of modern management 5(c) advanced and specialised training In the application ofan individual5s specialism to his field of activity.
(d) the machinery and practice of government andadministrationThe trainee should spend some further time in his department i^ciertaking more responsible work.   As many as possible should gainexperience of work outside the Service.   All should have somepractical experience in the supervision and control of staff.   TheDhole process should take up to five years (paragraph 106).1(5,   Many specialist graduates should go to management eoarsee-at the Civil Service College after a few years in the Service.   Manyshould also be selected to return to the College at an appropriatestage for longer and more general courses in administration and management (paragraph 108).1(6.   The 18-year-old entry should be encouraged to take additional.;ualifications appropriate to their work; training and further education facilities outside the Service should be supplemented as necessary within the Service itself; bursaries and paid leave shouldbe made available.   Those going into management work will requiretraining; the best should be picked out to join the graduates on major training courses (paragraph 109).The College should put in:, hand a rapid and large-scaleprogramme for the further training of the present generation ofj civil servants (paragraph 110).H8.   Courses at the Civil Service College should not be restricted1 to civil servants; on many courses a proportion should be set asideI tor men and women from other spheres (paragraph 111).W.   The Civil Service College should not attempt to provide thetotal amount of training required by civil servants; departments should continue to run their own courses; more civil servants should attend courses at universities and business schools (paragraph 112).150.  The College will need its own full-time staff but should also  employ on a part-time or ad hoc basis civil servants and teachersI and instructors drawn from universities, business schools, industryItofl commerce, nationalised industry and local government (paragraphU3).
51.   The civil  Service College should be under the general directionof the Civil Service Department, but it should have its owngoverning body consisting of civil servants and men and women from outside (paragraph 114).Career management52.   During the early years of a man&apos;s career he should remain withinthe specialism or group for which he is trained; he should movebetween jobs and perhaps between departments, but usually within thearea of his specialism, and, in the case of the administrator, atmuch less frequent intervals than now; the basic principle of careermanagement should be a progressive development within a specialismand between related fields of activity; the personal interests andwishes of the individual should be taken into account morepositively (paragraph 115).53.   Increased attention to personnel management and industrialcareer planning should apply to specialists no less than to administrative staff (paragraph 115).%. Personnel  and organisation branches should be expanded to meetmuch greater demands (paragraph 115).55.   Seniority should count for promotion when it reflectsexperience of value for higher posts; but there should be moreopportunity for the really able to move fairly rapidly up.   In the assessment of staff more weight should be given to performance onthe job measured against set objectives (paragraph 117).56.   It should be evident to all that a man&apos;s performance before apromotion board is not the decisive factor in determining fitnessfor promotion; the primary job of the board should be to produce a fair and uniform judgement of individuals&apos; promise andpotentiality based primarily on their superiors&apos; assessment of theirperformance in their present job (paragraph 119).57.   For promotions to posts at the level of Assistant Secretary,Under Secretary, etc. the Permanent Secretary should be assisted bya small committee (a &quot;paper board&apos;); there should be specialistson the committee, and, for promotion to Under Secretary level, arepresentative of the Civil Service Department (paragraph 120).
58,   The terms Establishments division&apos; and Establishments work&apos;ghould be used no longer (paragraph 121).&apos;59,   Personnel management and organisation work will call for higher expertise and greater specialisation.   Those specialising init should from time to time get experience in work in the fieldoutside the Service; they should have had experience of working in3n operating division (paragraph 122).MOBILITY PENSIONS AND A CAREER SERVICE ( CHAPTER ki APPENDIX G ANDLate Entry60.   Late entry should be considerably expanded; there should be no restriction on the levels to which suitably qualified and experiencedpeople from outside the Service can be directly appointed(paragraph. 12k).Temporary appointments61,   There should be more temporary appointments on short-term contracts, particularly of specialists (paragraph 3).62,   The Service should find means of reducing the proportion ofother temporary staff and should examine ways of ensuring that civil servants do not continue to serve on a temporary basis forunduly long periods (paragraph 127).Interchange of staff with other employments63.   Determined efforts should be made to bring about, as a two-wayprocess, the temporary interchange of staff, both administrative and specialist, with other employments on a much larger scale; theService should set up joint working parties with local governmentand with industry to agree on a method and organise the practicaldetails of a programme (paragraph 6, Appendix G, paragraph 11),Personal appointments by minister so\,   A Minister should be able to employ on a temporary basis suchsmall numbers of professional experts as he personally considers heneeds to help and advise him; this practice should be put on to a regular and clearly understood basis (paragraph 129).jtovement out of the Service65.   All civil servants who have served for an appropriateQualifying period should be able to transfer or preserve their
pension rights on voluntarily leaving the Service (paragraph 136).66.   The Service should take the system of probation much more67.   The Service should have wider powers to retire on pension thosewho have ceased to earn their keep, and should use them with moredetermination (paragraph 133).&apos; The Civil Service as a career68.   The Civil Service should remain a career service in the sense that most civil servants should enter at young ages with the expectation, but not the guarantee, of a life-time&apos;s employment;and tnat the great majority of those who come to occupy top jobsI will be career civil servants (paragraph 134).: Pension arrangements69.   Full transfer arrangements should be made with private pension schemes wherever this is practicable; a frozen pension should be awarded on voluntary leaving in cases where a more satisfactorytransfer arrangement has not yet been made (paragraph 136, AppendixH, paragraph 9).70.   Every civil servant - subject to having served for theI appropriate qualifying period - should be entitled to a pensionrelated to the length of his service; the pension scheme should beI extended to cover temporary staff (paragraph 137).71.   Five years should be substituted as the qualifying period bothI for a frozen pension and for a pension on final retirement (AppendixH, paragraph 10).\ 12.   The management should retain reserve powers to withhold thepreservation of pension rights, but they should be used veryI  sparingly (Appendix H, paragraph 11).J73. The possibility of basing retirement pensions not on the\ average salary over the last three years of service, but on theaverage salary over the best three yeara,should be considered\   (Appendix H, paragraph 22).
ft.   The feasibility of a   change    to a contributory pension scheme should be examined as quickly as possible (Appendix H,paragraph 26).75,   The existing &quot;added years&quot; provision should be replaced by aaider power that can be more flexibly applied (Appendix H,paragraph 28).76.   The need to legislate in order to make changes in the pension scheme is an unnecessary implication; another method should be lookedI for (Appendix H, paragraph 30).Terms of employment11,   &quot;Establishment&quot; should be abolished (paragraph 142).   Thenew terms of employment should be: -(a) For all appointments except temporary staff, there shouldbe a two-year period of probation.(b) On successful completion of probation, an individualshould be informed and offered indefinite employment subjectto a reasonably long period of notice; we suggest up to six months on each side.   The Service should be able to end the employment only on one of the following grounds: -(i) redundancy,(ii) ill-health,(iii) disciplinary reasons,(iv) culpable inefficiency,(v) early retirement in the interests of the Service.In each case there should be appropriate safeguards forthe person concerned.(c) Temporary staff should whenever possible be offered short-tenrappointments for a specified number of years (paragraph 143).78,   The process of confirming a civil servant in his appointmentshould be handled in a way that reduces the administrativecomplications involved in the process.    It should be deferred untilsuccessful completion of probation.   There should be considerabledelegation of authority, subject to appropriate checks by the CivilService Department (paragraph 144).
Compulsory Early Retirement79.   Section 9 of the Superannuation Act should he abolished and section 10 should he extended to all civil servants so that a civil servant over the age of 50 may be prematurely retired forinefficiency with the immediate payment of a pension earned byhis service (Appendix H, paragraphs 15-16).80,   A new procedure should be introduced for the senior ranks ofthe Home civil  Service to deal with those officers whose retirementis &quot;desirable in the public interest&quot;;    the procedure should include provision for an appeal to an independent board;    the person concerned should be given the maximum amount of warning at all stages of the procedure.      There should be some enhancement ofpension in the case of officers retired prematurely under this procedure (Appendix H, paragraph 17-21).Retiring age81.   The Service should pay continuing attention to the problem of determining the right retiring age in the light of current research and national policies towards retirement.      (Appendix H,paragraph 29.)THE STRUCTURE OF DEPARTMENTS AND THE   GMOglON Of EFEICIEMCJACCOUNTABLE AND EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT (CHAPTER 5, APPENDIX I-)82.   The principles of accountable management should be applied tothe work of departments.     Where measures of achievement can beestablished in quantitative or financial terms and individuals held responsible for output and costs, accountable units should be set upwork of this kind should be organised into separate &quot;commands11;    the manager of each command should be given clear-cut responsibilities and commensurate authority and should be held accountable forperformance against budgets, standards of achievement and other testwithin his unit he should set up sub-systems of responsibility anddelegated authority (paragraphs 153-1514.).83, In much administrative work, measurable output cannot always bemade the criterion for assessing performance;    the principle to be
applied is management by objective;    the objectives and priorities of the branch should be clearly established;individuals at all levels should know what they are responsible forj 2nd what authority they have (paragraph I55-156).8ll.   The establishment of accountable units must involve an additionI to the Service &apos;s traditional accounting to supplement the formal: Parliamentary accounts with cost data (paragraph 151).i 35,   When several departments, or several branches within aj department, have a substantial interest in the same problem, methods\ should be devised of concentrating in one man or group theI responsibility for organising the material and putting forward a1 solution;    departments should make opportunities of adoptingI the problem-solving approach whenever they can. (paragraph 158.)j 86.   The Service should make experiments in reducing the number\ of working levels in the organisation of the flow of businessI (paragraph 159).\ 87.   Where administrators and specialists are jointly engaged on a\ common task, there should be a single integrated structure under asingle head, who should be the man with the most appropriateQualifications for the job.     Below him administrators and specialistsshould be integrated in teams or unified hierarchies, in which theindividual posts are filled by administrators or specialistsaccording to the requirements of the task (paragraphs I6O-162).The departmental management services unit88.   Each major department should contain a management servicesunit with wider responsibilities and functions than are given to0. and M. divisions at present and, in particular, with the1 following changes:-(a)   There should be efficiency audits involving all aspectsof the departments work at all levels, with special attention to studies designed to improve organisationalefficiency.
(b) The management services unit should be made respo    iblefor promoting the use of the best management techniques.(c) 0. and M. should he equipped to operate effectively at aillevels  in a department.(d) The functions of 0. and ivl. and staff inspection should hecombined in the same unit, which would mount operations of varying scale and depth according to the problem(paragraph I65).89.   The staff of the management services unit should be drawn fromadministrators,  appropriate specialists, including accountants,and those with experience of similar work outside the Service;many should   spend long periods in this type of work;    many shouldhave a relevant degree or professional Qualification and experienceas a manager or administrator in an operating division, followedI by more specialised Graining in management techniques and subsequent refresher training (paragraphs 166-167).30.   Departments should continue to bring in outside consultants forspecial assignments (paragraph 168).91.   Management services units themselves should be periodicallysubjected to external efficiency audit  (paragraph 170).The working environment32.   Much more needs to be done to improve the physical surroundingsin which civil servants work (paragraph 171).      In particular,lavatories and washroom facilities should be improved (Appendix I,paragraph 5).93.   The pay of typists should be examined in order to combinescales suitable for girls who want a career in the Civil Service withscales appropriate for those who would prefer a short-term contract.(Appendix I, paragraph 6.)19^.   Shared and central secretarial assistance should be extended;1 the criterion should be the needs of the work at any level (Appendix I,J Paragraph 7).
policy planning work95,   A department &apos;s responsibility for major leg -term policyplanning should be clearly allocated to a planning and research unit(paragraph 173).96.   Planning Units should be staffed by comparatively younp; menand women who should not normally remain in them beyond theirmid-forties, (paragraphs 175-176).The overall direction of departments97.   There should be a Senior Policy Adviser or Advisers in most,if not all, departments to assist the Minister;   he should bethe head of the Planning Unit;   his prime job would be to look to,and prepare for, the future and to ensure that day-to-day policy decisions are taken with a full recognition of likely future developments;   he should have direct and unrestricted access to theMinister and should be free to determine, after consultation withthe Permanent Secretary but subject only to the approval of theMinister, what problems his planning unit should tackle;    he shouldnot have responsibility for the day-to-day operations of thedepartment;    his rank should not normally be below that ofDeputy Secretary (paragraphs I82-I8I4.).98.    In some big technical departments, it may be right toappoint a chief scientist,engineer stc. take charge of the depart-ment&apos;s technical work (paragraph I85).99.    One man, the Permanent Secretary, should continue to haveoverall responsibility for all the affairs of the department;    heshould be head of the office under the Minister (paragraph 186).The delegation of responsibility to autonomous public boards100. We recommend an early and thorough review of the question of&quot;hiving off&quot; (paragraph 180).The structure of the civil  Service (Chapter 6 and Appendix J)101. The structure of the Service should be based on the following principles:-
(a) Both the grading of a post and the selection of the manto fill it should be based on an evaluation of the job.(b) Management should appoint to each post the person it considers best fitted to  fill it.(c) No posts should be the preserve of any group except inso far as  the individuals comprising the group may beuniquely qualified for them.(d) It should be the right and duty of management to determine the new qualifications and experience required for particular posts from time to time.(e) In filling individual   posts, management should promote the right man even if he is not the next in the order ofseniority, or bring him in from outsiae the Service ifhe cannot be found within it or if it believes that an appointment from outside would bring a valuable reinforce-ment of skill and experience.(f) The pay for posts should continue to reflect the rate forthe job on the basis of fair comparison with market ratesfor jobs of comparable responsibility and authorityoutside the Service.(g) The structure should permit work to be organised in sucha way that chains of command reflect the demands of thetask an dr where necessary, cut across any groupings by^discipline, or type of skill (paragraph 21k).*102. To give full effect to our proposals, the present multitude ofGlasses and their separate career structures should be replaced bya classless, uniformly graded structure, (paragraph 218).103. The salary range or scale for each grade should be relativelybroad and there should be overlapping of salaries between graaes(paragraph 219).
11%. All the jobs now performed by the many different classes shouldbe fitted into the appropriate grade by a process of job evaluation (paragraph 220),105. The structure proposed is essentially a pay structure; itshould not be used to determine the actual organisation of work(paragraph 221).106. At all levels    where the work requires civil servants tospecialise, occupational groups will be needed and civil servantsshould generally be recruited and trained as members of them;they should include the administrative groups,  the present specialistdisciplines and the supporting grades (paragraph 223).107. Occupational groups will tend to develop their own careerpatterns, and it should be established that it is normal to sKipgrades on promotion (paragraph 225).108, The principle of &quot;fair comparison with the currentremuneration of outside staffs employed on broadly comparablework&quot;&apos;, established by the Royal Commission on the Civil Service1953-55 . remains valid.     Outside comparisons should be made as partof the process of job evaluation, assessing the importance of the job to the work of the Service and establishing the rate for jobs of similar responsibility outside the Service.    (paragraph 226.)109. Negotiation and arbitration in the settling of pay claims shouldbe preserved (paragraph 227).110. Each grade should carry a range of pay except (in the view of amajority) the grade equivalent to that of Permanent Secretary, whichshould be paid at a flat rate (paragraph 228).Hi. Progression through the pay-scale of each grade should be more flexible;    annual increments should continue up to the level of under Secretary, but -(a) additional increments should be granted for especiallygood work and for success in gaining relevantqua1ifications,(b) increments should be withheld when they have not beenearned.
Above this level the range of pay for each grade should become a &quot;band&quot; of pay;    the progress of each officer through the bandshould not be on a regular incremental basis but determined by anannual review of his performance (paragraph 229).Supportinp; Grades112. The case for a unified grading structure applies to thesupporting grades as well as to the other levels of the Service(Appendix J, paragraph 2).113. Departments should make special efforts to select and trainthose in the supporting grades who wish and have the aptitude tomove to other types of work (Appendix K, paragraph 8).priorities in the establishment of a unified grading structureIII4. The Civil Service Department should mount a major study tov/ork out the details  (including the number of grades and thesystem of job evaluation appropriate to the Service) of a schemefor a unified grading structure together with the time-scale forits application (paragraph 2U3).THE CENTRAL HANAGEMRT .0F THE jOIVJlL gJSRVJCCJS JLNP WJTfl.STAFF ASSOCIATIONS (CHAPTER ?)115. The role of central management should be changed andenlarged;    its primary role should be to ensure that the Service iscontinuously governed by the principle outlined in Chapter 1.(paragraphs 22+7 and 22+8.)116. Central management should have the appropriate degree of ultimate authority in those questions that affect the interests ofthe public service as a whole (paragraph 2h8).117. The expanded and unified central management of the Service shouldbe made the responsibility of a new department created specificallyfor that purpose;    the first main step to be taken in the reform of the service should be the setting up of a new Civil service department which should absorb the functions of the Civil service commission, and carry the responsibilities for central management,(paragraphs 22+8 and 25h).
118. The new department should be staffed by a mixture of long-term and short-term appointments;    departments should release some oftheir best men for a period of service in it, and some should beappointed from outside the Service (paragraph 255).119. The department should include specialists;    there should be an appropriate measure of central management for all the majoroccupational groups (paragraph 256).120. The new department should include a Planning Unit(paragraph 257).121. The official head of the civil  Service Department should be designated Head of the Home Civil Service;   he should receive a lead in pay over the other official heads of departments in theHome Civil Service (paragraph 258).122. We hope that the Prime Minister will remain directly responsible for senior appointments as well as for the machinery ofgovernment and security (paragraph 259).      In putting forward namesfor top appointments to the Prime Minister, the Head of theGivil Service should be assisted by a Committee of variablecomposition drawn from a panel with a rotating membershipconsisting of Permanent Secretaries, scientists and otherspecialists and. one or two eminent people from outside theService (paragraph 260).123. The Prime Minister may wish to delegate day-to-dayresponsibility, outside the area for which he is directly responsible, to a non-departmental Minister of appropriateseniority who is also a member of the Cabinet (paragraph 261).Relations between the Civil Service Department and otherdepartments121).. The principle should be to delegate to individual departments the maximum authority in staff and organisation matters compatible with the requirements of the Service as a whole (paragraph 263).
125. On questions of departmental efficiency and organisation, themain role of the Civil Service Department should he to encourage the use of the most modern techniques;    it may have a special part to play in assisting reorganisation at the higher levels of otherdepartments;    in the last analysis it should he in a positionto call departments to account for failure to use the recommendedtechniques, to carry out investigations of departmental organisationand to recommend improvements  (paragraph 263 (c)).126. In the management of staff,  especially the planning of careers,the main responsibility must remain with the employing departments;but the Civil Service Department should play a larger partthan the Treasury does  today and should have more iltimate authority;    it should be responsible for informing itself aboutthose civil servants who are identified as capable of filling thehighest posts, should consult with the employing departments about their training and development and should take the initiative in proposing appropriate moves;    it should have a voice, especiallyduring the early years of the new system, in promotions to the senior Policy and Management Group and should be represented on allthe departmental boards for promotions within the group(paragraph 263 (d)).Relations with the Treasury127. The functions now exercised by the &quot;Pay and Management&quot; group of the Treasury should be transferred to the Civil service department, including:-(a) responsibility for advising the Prime Minister on machineryof government questions;(b) genial supervision of departmental organisation;(c) the development and dissemination of administrative andmanagerial techniques- in addition to the broad responsibility for the management of theCivil Service;   the division should be based on the principle thatall the functions that belong to the Treasury in its role as&quot;employer&quot; should be transferred (paragraphs 265-266).
128c The Civil Service Departments should he solely responsihle forapplying the Governments incomes policy to the public service;within the normal rules of collective Cabinet responsibility,  itshould have the final authority on any given pay settlement(paragraph 267(a)).129. The central responsibility for ensuring that departments areefficiently and economically staffed should rest solely with theGivil Service Department;    it should be its task to determine the scales of the staffs necessary for the efficient discharge ofthe tasks of departments (paragraph 267(b)).I3O. Working procedures between spending departments and thetwo central departments, and between the central departmentsthemselves, should be devised in order to reduce administrativecomplications to the minimum;    arrangements should be based upon the clearest possible distinction between the functions and responsibilities of the two departments  (paragraph 268).Whitley Council Machinery in the role of staff associations131. The staff associations and the Civil Service Department shouldjointly take part in a review to determine the new pattern of joint consultation appropriate in the light of the Governments decisions on our report;    the pattern of joint consultation should reflect,not determine, the results of the changes we propose (paragraphs273-27U).THE CIVIL SERVICE AND THE COMMUNITY (CHAPTER 8)Consultation and secrecy132. Consultation with the interests concerned should be as wideas possible and should form part of the normal processes of decision making (paragraph 278).133o The government should set up an inquiry to make recommendations for getting rid of unnecessary secrecy;    the Official Secrets Actshould be included in such a r eview (paragraph 280).
The Anonymity of civil  Servants134. The convention of anonymity should he modified and civilservants, as professional administrators, should be able to go further than now in explaining what their departments are doing, atany rate so far as concerns managing existing policies and implement-ing legislation (paragraph 283).Ministers and civil servants135, There should be no obstacle in the way of the Minister&apos;s selectingwithin the department, or on occasion more widely within the Service,as his Private Secretary the individual best suited to his ways ofworking, and no stigma should attach to a p-j? son who is moved out ofthis job (paragraph 286).I 136. We expect that Ministers will not normally wish to replaceI their Senior Policy Advisers;    this must however be possible when a\ new Minister finds the current holder of this office too closely\ identified with, or wedded to, policies that he wishes to change1 (paragraph 286).\ 137. It should be more exceptional for a Minister to change hisPermanent Secretary, but Ministers should not be stuck withPermanent Secretaries who are too rigid or tired (paragraph 286).Manpower138. We attach considerable  importance to the developing practicewhereby new policy proposals are accompanied by detailed estimates of manpower costs;    these, no less than other costs, should be thesubject of parliamentary and public debate (paragraph 301).The implementation of our proposals139. We hope that the government will take steps to review theprogress made in implementing our proposals (paragraph 30k).PROBLEMS OP THREE SPECIALIST GROUPS:Accountants. Research Officers and Lawyers (Appendix D)Accountantsllj.0. The practice of bringing in accountants from outside for majorjobs outside the normal routine should continue (paragraph 9).
, A strong force of highly-qualified professional accountantswithin the Service is also needed;    more qualified accountantsare needed:-(a)    in the senior policy management group;(h)    in purchasing;(c) in developing accountable and responsible management;(d) in management services (paragraphs 9-10).lJj.2. Trainee accountants should be articled to members of theorofession within government departments;    some entrants withA levels should be encouraged to take professional qualifications inaccounting for which they should be rewarded with additionalincreases of pay (paragraph 11).1113. The work now done by qualified accountants already in theService should be examined to see whether some of it could not be devolved upon less qualified staff (paragraph 11).Ikh&apos; Accountants should continue to be an identifiableoccupational group within the Service;    the group should includecost and works accountants (paragraph 12).1^5. The accountant needs broader training in his early years andalso at intervals during his career (paragraph lh).11+6. Late entry and temporary appointments should be encouraged(paragraph lli).11+7. There should be adequate central management of accountantsby the Civil Service Department (paragraph 15).LawyersI48. The role of the Treasury Solicitor should be expanded and puton to a formal basis as Head of the Legal Service;    the managementcommittee should continue to function;    consideration should begiven to including a representative of the legal service in the staffof the Civil Service Department (paragraph 19).
&apos; &quot;.   v. i   .j11+9. Departments should have normal control over their legalbranches;   hut the central management of the legal service shouldhave a general concern f or all questions of staff, and should he responsible for thinking constructively about improvements in organisation and methods of work (paragraph 20).15O. Certain kinds of legal work,  such as conveyancing and litigationshould be centralised; legal branches in other departments should consist largely of lawyers engaged in giving legal advice on thepolicy of the department (paragraph 21),151. Scotland should have a separate legal service organised on similar lines (paragraph 22).152. Civil servants with the r ight aptitudes and interests shouldbe given the opportunity to acquire professional qualifications inorder to join the legal service (paragraph 2h).153. Legal executive work should be recognised as a specialism andadministrative staff encouraged to  take it up, (paragraph 25).151+. Lawyers should play their full part in the consideration andformulation of policy.      Senior lawyers, as members of the seniorpolicy and management group, should be regarded as being concernedwith the affairs of the department at large (paragraph 26).155&apos; Lawyers with the desire and aptitude should be considered forjobs of a more general administrative or managerial character(paragraph 27).Research Officers156. The Service should continue to recruit staff for doingresearch work (paragraph 33).157. Research Officers should normally be employed within departments and especially in Planning Units.     We would also expect them to beemployed by the Civil Service College.     They should take part in theprocess of considering what research should be done and itstranslation into policy (paragraph 3k) *
158* Departments should pay careful attention to the earlyidentification of those Research Officers capable of fillingadministrative posts (paragraph 35).
