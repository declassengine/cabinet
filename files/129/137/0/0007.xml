MISDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT)9(68^772 ^hM.^Lt.-^--COPY NO.CABINETREDUCTION OF MINISTRY OF PUBLIC BUILDINGmiORKS^IRECT LAB OUR FOjRGEM em memorandum Jb^ the^ J^^ac^ollox^of the^ ^^ heque^The proposal by the Minister of Public Building and Works toreduce his dstreet labour force must be viewed against the background of the urgent need for reductions in Government expenditure.    TheMann Committeers report revealed waste of money.     Running down the directly employed labour force by one third and placing the workout to contract could produce net savings of the order of  5 million ayear.2.     It would be impossible to obtain equivalent savings retaining theexisting labour force.    We cannot afford to rely on natural wastage ja run down is essential and the Minister!s proposals have had theunqualified support of Treasury Ministers throughout.3.     The proposed criteria for employment of direct labour wouldprobably reduce numbers by 9,000/10,000 spread over the country.The Minister^ proposals would not begin to produce redundanciesuntil the end of 1968 at the earliest and it would take some time tocomplete the operation.    No doubt many of the men discharged would find work with contractors and natural wastage would assist to theextent of about 1,000 men a yeare    The proposed policy is consistent with that which we have adopted in ^espa-cd;  of Government cleaners.4.     I agree that the Government must follow the code of conductfor redundancy which the Department of Employment and Productivityhas prepared.     There should be consultation with the unions concerned,on the basis of the Mann Report and the Minister^ proposals to reducehis direct labour force, reserving to management the right to take thefinal decision, after consultation, to reduce the force.5.     In my view the Minister&apos;s proposals can be made to meet therequirements of the First Secretaryrs policy by:-(i)      withholding publication of the Second Mann Report untilconsultations with the Trade Unions have been initiated;(ii)      presenting to the Trade Unions simultaneously feeSecond Mann Report and the Minister&apos;s proposals to reducehis direct labour force to the level determined by theproposed criteria;-1-
1&apos; ^ J(iii)    delaying public announcement until after the fullestconsultation with the Unions.6, I invite my colleagues to endorse the policy as agreed by theCommittee on Industrial Policy.R. H. J,Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,29th May, 1968-2-CONFiDENTIAL
