My colleagues in Cabinet will wish to see the paper which I circulated to the Steering Committee on Economic Policy aboutthe difficult prospect we face on public expenditure.    This prefaced the table giving the monthly Running Tally, of which copies have alreadybeen circulated.The Steering Committee approved the proposals set out inparagraph 10 of my paper and I draw the Committee1s conclusions to the attention of my colleagues so that they can be guided by them.R.

PUBLIC EXFL^IiPURE, REPORTMem or andum by. the chancellor el lor o^jthe. exchequer the Cabinet have decided to keep public expenditure underregular review, through this Committee, in relation to thedevelopment of the economy as a whole (C.C. (68)2lath Conclusions,Item 5, Conclusion (2)).    This memorandum is circulated for thefirst of these reviews.   Next month I. shall bring the 1 968Public Expenditure Survey before my colleagues.2.     We hi.ve announced our plans for a massive shift of resources to exports and for raising productive investment to a level which will enable Britain to gain and keep the requiredcompetitiveness in world markets.    Those pi ns were c ntainedin the Prime Minister&apos;s statement of 16th January on public expenditure (Cmnd 35*15) and in the Budget Statement and theeconomic forecasts which were published with it (H.0.151, Part III).The January decisions implied an average annual rise in public expenditure in the period 196&apos;.- -68 to 19c9- C of 2.8 per cent -kf per cent in 1968-69 over 196&apos;&quot;&apos;-68 and 1 per cent in 1969-70 over1968-69.   Figures fur public expenditure consistent with this plan were used in arriving at the Budget judgement, and for thispurpose they were expressed, as in the published Budget forecasts,in terms which show their effect on demand.    In that form,  they take account of the different degrees of impact on resourcesinvolved in the different forms th,- t public expenditure takes -capital expenditure, purchase of goods and services, transfer payments and so on.3.     The Committee, in these reviews of public expenditure, willbe concerned with the inter-relation of demand In the form ofprivate and public consumption and investment, and of imports and exports, within a total determined by the rate of growth,that can be achieved without prejudicing the achievement of thenecessary surplus on the balance of payments.    At this stagenothing that has emerged over the past month makes it necessaryto revise the assessment of the situation and outlook on whichthe Budget judgement w. s founded.    The unemployment trend has risen over the past two months and does not yet show signs of theexpansionar   influence of rising export orders.    But at the sametime the external deficit has continued to run at a very high level during the early months of this year.    These somewhatcontradictory trends do not however call for any departure fromthe Budget strategy.k.     This, however, is precisely what would be involved in adecision to allow public expenditure to grow faster in 1968-69 or
1969-70 than the January plan envisaged.    This would be a decisioneither to aim at less improvement in the balance of payments(or in the productive investment by which that improvement isto be sustained);, or to go for greater reduction of private consumption.5.     Confidence is still sensitive to the way in which we treatpublic expenditure, as the element in the economy most directly under our own control.    If our action on this front putsconfidence at risk again, our present strategy, severe thoughit is, might not then get us home,,The expenditure prospect6.     Eut the public expenditure trend that is emerging amountsto a material departure from our january   plan.    The figures are set out in the Annex to this memorandum,-    They are stillprovisional- they come from the returns for the 1 968 public expenditure Survey,  and these are still under examination bythe spending Departments and the Treasury.    I am using them heremerely to give a broad indication of what the Survey is likelyto show us in greater detail.7.     For 1968-69, the figures show an incre se of 5.2 per centtaking account only of items that h ve already been formallyapproved.    This appears in Part A of the Annex.    But, as Part Cof the Annex shows,  there are other items of additional expenditure in 1 968-69 which may emerge but which have not yetbeen formally approved.      80 we now face the possibility of an aggregate increase over 1968-69 of over 5.2 per cent, as againstthe kf per cent implied in the January Vftiite Paper.8.    For 1969-70, the position is worse still.    As Part A of the annex shows, the 1968 Survey is likely to come out above the january figures by an amount which is unlikely to be less than 200 million but which might even exceed  250 million.    On top of this, there are again the potential additions already indentified in Part C of the Annex for 1969-70, which could add over 32 million.    In short, the January figures indicated an increaseof about 1 per cent in 1969-70 over 1968-69; the figures thatwe now have suggest an increase of well over 2 per cent.   And we still have almost the whole of two years in which further additionsof expenditure affecting 1969-70 could arise and which are atpresent not foreseen at all.9.     I hope that the work which remains to be done by officials in preparing the Public Expenditure Survey will bring thesefigures back nearer to those in our January plan.    To the extent that it does not, the Survey itself and the contingency planning for savings which was commissioned b.  the Cabinet (C.C. (68)2h/th conclusions, Item 5, Conclusion (1)) should provide us with thematerial from which to work out how best we can recover theposition.10.    In the meantime, I seek my colleagues&apos;  endorsement to thefollowing action -(a) Spending Departments should declare and implementforthwith any savings that they have found incarrying out the Cabinet&apos;1 s instruction to search for economies in 1968-69 (C.C.(68)20th Conclusions,Item 5, Conclusion (l))j(b) They should pursue their search for further savings in 1968-69 and also in 1969-70. The inter-DepartmentalPublic Expenditure Survey Committee should co-ordinate2SECRET
this work and report at the same time as they submit the 1968 Survey itself;(c)     Decisions on new proposals which would add to public expenditure should be postponed until we can take stocknext month when we have the Survey and the medium term Economic -Assessment.R 0 H o J iH.
