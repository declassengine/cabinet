Vr. norUi/ENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &quot;S GOVERNMENT)C(68) 75 COPY NO.       6 628th May, 1968CABINETf.REDUCTION OF MINISTRY OF PUBLIC BUILDING AND WCRIlSDIRECT lABQUPv FORCEMemorandum by the Lord President of the council at their meeting on 22nd May the Home Publicity Committee had before them the attached memoranda (IN(68) 21 and PH(68) 15 - AnnexesA and B) from the Minister of Public Building and Works on his proposed reduction of the Ministry of Public Building and Works Direct labour force.    The Committee also had before them a letter (Annex C) tothe Minister from the First Secretary of State.2,       Although the Committee1 s terms of reference limited it to considering how the impact of this announcement could best be softenedby publicity, we found it impossible to discuss the strict publicityaspects of the problem without being driven back to considerationof the policy involved.    And this difficulty was reinforced by theFirst Secretary who followed up her letter by emphasising the damage to the Governments public relations with the trade unions which wouldbe caused if the Minister of Public Building and Works announced large-scale dismissals of his direct labour staff without following out the code of conduct for redundancy which the Department of Employment and productivity has just prepared and is about to publish.3,      Since the view of the Home Publicity Committee was obviouslygreatly at variance with that of the Industrial Policy Committee, it wasagreed that the Lord President should consult the Prime Minister on thebest v/ay to resolve this disagreement.    The Prime Minister thendirected that the matter should be brought forward for considerationby the Cabinet.R.H.S.C.Privy Council Office, S.W.1.27th May, 19680
Mm a proposed REDUCTION OF THE M. F.B.W. direct labour FORCEMemorandum by. the Minister of Public Branding and works have come to the conclusion that for reasons of efficiency and economy I must make early and substantial reductions in the size of my direct labour force employed on maintenance and minor new works at home.      I have reached this conclusion after discussion with the Chief Secretary ofthe Treasury as well as with colleagues in the Ministry ofDefence,  the Ministry of Housing and Local Government,  theMinistry of Health and the Department of Economic Affairs.They are all in agreement with my proposals below;background.     At present my Ministry employs some 30,000 direct labour at home.     About 20 per cent of this total are engaged onoperating such services as sewage plants, boiler stoking,grounds maintenance, etc.     Almost all the remainder areemployed on the maintenance of buildings and installations and on minor new works.      In these latter categories, however,over half the work is put out to contract.     Major new works at home are practically all done by contract.3.     In November,  1964* the then Minister of Public building and Works appointed a Committee (the Mann Committee)  to review the current methods of executing maintenance and minor new works.     Most of this Committee&apos;s recommendations were concerned with improving contractual arrangements and these recommendations have largely been implemented.      As regardsdirect labour the Committee came to the conclusion that &quot;for most maintenance and minor new works the Ministry can obtainservice on more favourable terms from contractors than fromD.E.L.&quot;     They accordingly recommended that the employment of direct labour should be limited to operating services, plannedmaintenance, emergency services at establishments withoperational commitments, maintenance and new works wheresecurity and safety were paramount,  and where work was interrupted by operations.     They further recommended that immediate action should be taken to achieve a long-termreduction in direct labour, the improvement of supervision,and the working out of a simplified incentive scheme.
4,     The Minister o  the day came to the conclusion that thequestion of comparative costs needed much closer studybefore it would be right to take any decisions such as theCommittee had proposed about the future of D.E.L.     he accordingly appointed a second Committee, under the sameChairman but with a broader based membership,  to make a detailed study of the comparative, costs of doing maintenanceby D.E.L. and by contract.The Committee reported last May and I attach a copy.5.     It will be seen that the Committee took great pains to try and obtain a true comparison between the cost of work done by D.E.L. and by contract.      The figures which theyproduced suggest that the cost of executing work by D.E.L.was very considerably higher than the cost of employingcontractors, the excess being as followss-Building and Civil Engineering Work:       36 per centFainting Work: 52 per centElectrical Work: 42 per cent a subsidiary comparison for the Building and civil engineering Work, relating the cost of the D.E.L. time to thelabour element in contract rates, showed that the former was59 per cent in excess of the latter.     The Committee&apos;general conclusion, however,  (paragraph 55) was expressedin somewhat guarded terms as follows:-&quot;The inference from these exercises lead to theconclusion that the employment of direct labour is notcompetitive with the use of contractors&quot;6.     A further reason for caution in using the Committee&apos;sstatistics is that their review does not satisfy all thecanons of the statistician.     The depots and the jobsselected were not strictly a random sample,  and there are other factors that cannot be accepted without somereservations.      I am, however,  satisfied that the 700 jobscosted (and this represents about a year&apos;s intensive study)were a fair cross-section of the work, and that theCommittee&apos;s general conclusion about the competitiveness ofD.E.L. must be accepted.     One cannot be certain about the precise extent of the disparity in costs, but I think thatthere can be little doubt that at present it is substantial.Possible Courses of Action7.     It seemed to me that this Report left me with two possible courses of action.     The first was to use the Report as astimulant for much greater productivity by my direct labour force:    I would seek the active assistance of the tradeunions in a major productivity drive on the understanding that only if direct labour could be made readily competitive withcontractors, could I afford to employ direct labour on thepresent scale in the long-term.     This course of action wouldinvolve no immediate large scale reduction in the direct labour force but might result in a major run-down later if the-2-
force could not improve its productivity very considerablyindeed.     This course has obvious social and humanitarianadvantages;    reflects the fact that some of the jobs costedby the Mann Committee were competitive with contractors;would encourage active co-operation from the trade unions;and would avoid any appearance of prejudice against directlyemployed labour.8.     There is, however, one great shortcoming in this course:at a time when immediate economies are required and thenation looks to the Government for a clear and strong lead,such a course falls short in decisiveness and sense of urgency.      I have had in mind too the strong line which wehave already taken in similar circumstances as regards CivilService cleaners.     Moreover it would take some time and anincrease in non-industrial staff numbers to improveproductivity and even then it must be a matter of doubt whether even with a major effort on the part of the tradeunions and the men themselves, we could bridge the whole ofthe gap disclosed by the Report between contractors&apos; costs and our own.     In these circumstances I came to theconclusion that I must take another course - one with a stronger emphasis on both economy and efficiency.9.     I therefore propose to review forthwith the whole of thework carried out by my D.E.L.  force and to limit it in future to work on which there is either no real alternative to direct labour or where direct labour meets the requirementsmost effectively and economically,      This means consideringin detail the nature of the work, its location, the needs ofclient departments and the availability of suitable and competitive contractual capacity.     On this basis the criteria set out in the Appendix would be applied to the work done by direct labour at each of the 300-odd depots which Ihave at home.      I propose to set up an official forking Party,including a Treasury representative,  to ensure that this is done consistently.      It will take much careful study and several months to do all this and until it is all done i cannot be sure what the outcome will be.     A broad appreciationsuggests however that a reduction in numbers of about 30 percent will result (about 9,000 to 10,000 men).      Provided thereis no unforeseen delay, discharges would start at about theend of 1968 and would continue for some time.10.     I intend to make the necessary reduction in numbers with proper humanity.     Many of my direct labour are elderly, halfof them are established and many more have been with theMinistry for years.     Many of the men I discharge will no doubtfind work with contractors but the programme of redundancywill need to be timed and executed with care and forethought.In judging the timing of dismissals, we will need to bear inmind, amongst other things,  the effects on the employmentposition in the development areas and other areas of relatively high unemployment.      Even so there is a risk that the tradeunions will take strike action and possibly action to make itdifficult for contractors to take on additional labour.     Theremay well also be difficulties in Parliament;    I refer to these in para. 13 below.
-4-Xi,     Under this scheme I should continue to employ some20,000 men and their productivity must be increased up tothe level of contractors&apos;  labour.      I intend to take this up with the unions as the second part of my new policy.     Measuresto improve productivity have hitherto largely been left tolocal effort pending the outcome of the Mann Committee Report.I intend now to initiate a drive right the way through theMinistry.     This will include the better planning and organisation of work;    the training of management at thevarious levels;    and the appointment of consultants to adviseboth on immediate steps to improve productivity ana on theneed for more radical longer-term studies.Consultation wijththe Trade Unions12.     The trade unions have known ever since October 196.4that the Mann Committee would be studying the future use of direct labour.     My predecessor undertook to consult themfurther on the basis of the attached Report.      I now intend to give them copies;    to tell them the course of action whichI have outlined above;    to ask for their comments on the criteria to be adopted for the future employment of direct labour;    and I would ask for their co-operation on the basis that this new policy provides a firm and sound basis for thefuture of direct labour.Statement in the House13.     As soon as possible after I have done this I shall need to make a statement in the House.     Over a period of nine months now it has been known that the Report attached had beensubmitted and I have been asked about it in the House, includingthe matter of publication.     The policy which I shall announcewill of course be welcomed by the declared opponents of B.E.L.and attacked by its champions.      Both sides are wrong.     direct labour is an excellent instrument in the right circumstances and it is in those circumstances that I intend to employ it forthe future.      It is neither right nor wrong in itself.      I appreciate that prejudice will be involved on either side andit will be my objective to show that we have reached a balancedconclusion based on a full and painstaking review.Publication of the Report14.     There is one point in connection with this statement onwhich I particularly seek the advice of my colleagues, namelywhether the Report attached should or should not be published.It was drafted in a way that would allow publication if desired;there is no confidential information in it.     The arguments against publication are that it discloses a very uncompetitivestandard of work on the part of the Ministry&apos;s D.E.L.;    and itwill throw doubt upon the ability of D.E.L. to compete withcontractors generally.      It will be used avidly by anyoneprejudiced against direct labour.     On the other hand it is anhonest statement of what the Committee found - and theirfindings were not always in favour of the contractor.     Moreover,I doubt whether it will be wise to try and suppress the Report.I am bound to give it to the trade unions and there is no wayof ensuring that some part at least of its contents will notleak out.     This will form the basis for a whole host of
questions and in the end a good deal of the import of theReport -rfill be squeezed out of us.      This will provideopponents of D.E.L. with a whole series of miner triumphs andwill put us in a poor light.      I am convinced that in thecircumstances it would be best to face up to the situation andpublish.     When this has been done we are likely to have acalmer and more appreciative atmosphere for the policy which Iintend to carry through.Conclusions15.     I ask my colleagues for their support in (a) the generalpolicy outlined in paragraph 9 above,  (b) an announcement inthe House as proposed in paragraph 13 and (c)  publication ofthe Report.R.  J. M.Ministry of Public Building and Works,Lambeth Bridge House,  S.E.I.7th May,  1968.-5-65
APPENDIXCRITERIA TO GOVERN THE EMPLOYMENT Of DIRECTLABOUP. BY M. PJ.W.(paragraph 9 of the Paper)The categories of maintenance work on which direct labour will be employed by M.P.B.W. in future will be asfollows:-1.     Running basic services such as sewage works,electricity supply, boilers, lifts, etc.2.     Urgent day-to-day maintenance work atestablishments where (e.g. because ofisolation)  satisfactory service cannot beobtained from contractors.3.     Maintenance services which because of specialcircumstances (e.g. the need for unusualskills) can be performed more economicallyby D.E.L. than by contractors.4.     ?.7here there are special requirements which canbe satisfied effectively and economically only by the use of direct labour (e.g. security,safety, emergency requirements, co-operationwith clients&apos;  activities, on-call requirements,special requirements at the Royal Palaces andthe Houses of Parliament).5.     Planned preventive maintenance work wheresatisfactory contractual arrangements cannotbe made.-6-
REDUCTION OF MINISTRY OF PUBLIC building and WORKS DIRECT LABOUR FORCEMemorandum by the Minister of Public Building and Works1. I seek the advice of the Committee on the publication of theattached report of the Mann Committee on the comparative costs orexecuting my Ministry&apos;s building maintenance work by (a) contract and (b) Directly Employed Labour,background.     In a recent memorandum (IN(68)21) to the Industrial PolicyCommittee I said that for reasons of efficiency and economy, IIntended to reduce considerably the size of my Direct labour force employed on maintenance at home,    I described two possible ways of carrying out such a reduction:    the first would be gradual and effected largely through natural wastage;    the second,which I put forward as my proposal and which the industrial policy Committee approved, was to make early and substantial reductions by limiting the future employment of my D.E.L.  force to work on which there is either no real alternative to direct labour or where direct labour meets the requirement most effectively and economically.    This would probably involve areduction in the force of some 30%, though the exact numberswould depend on the careful application throughout the 300-odddepots concerned of criteria based on the policy I have described above.3.     Such an immediate run-down would of course be mostunpalatable to the trade unions, but I had in mind the fact thatin present circumstances immediate economies are required andthat the nation looks to the Government for a clear and stronglead in such matters as this.    It is my intention to hold anearly meeting with the unions and to tell them of my intendedPolicy.    i should make it clear to them that I also intend to initiate forthwith a strong drive within my D.E.L. force forincreased productivity.4.     If I am to explain all this successfully to the unions i must give them in detail the reasons why I feel bound to implementsuch a severe policy.    The Mann Report shows conclusively thatthe difference in cost between contract and D.E.L. is very great.Thus, the excess cost of using direct labour is 36% for building and civil engineering work, 42% for electrical work and 52% forPainting.   Even with immediate steps to improve productivitythere can be no hope of my D.E.L. achieving parity withcontractors1 charges for a considerable time ahead even ifParity is theoretically attainable in all areas:    this I am inclined to doubt.67AMffiJ
685      The unions know that the Report has been submitted to mearid they know that my predecessor was unwilling to make a policydecision regarding the future use of D.E.L. until this report was available so that the comparative costs of doing work bycontract and by D.E.L.  could be demonstrated.    In discussions with my predecessor the unions asserted that in practice D.E.L.is cheaper than contractors and they gave evidence to the MannCommittee in this sense.    It will be quite impossible for me to persuade the trade unions to accept a major reduction in D.E.L.without explaining to them the evidence on which I have reachedmy conclusions.    They will wish to consider the evidence in detail and criticise it.    Only when they have done this will they acceptthe fact that a major reduction is inevitable.    By far the most satisfactory,  and possibly the only way of securing this resultwill be to show the Report itself to the unions.6.    Against this background I consulted the Lord President, inaccordance with the conclusions of the Industrial Policy Committee,on whether the Committee on Home Publicity should consider theform and timing of my statement, when I come to make it inParliament, about the future of my direct labour force.   As aresult of this discussion I am putting this paper to the Committeestraight away.7.     It is of course inevitable that the publication of the MannCommittee Report will give rise to adverse comment.    The Reportdiscloses a very uncompetitive standard of work on the part ofthe Ministry&apos;s P.E.L.  and it will throw doubt upon the ability of D.E.L. generally to compete with contractors.    It will be usedavidly by anyone prejudiced against direct labour.    On the otherhand it is an honest statement of what the Mann Committee foundwithin my Ministry - and their findings were not always in favourof the contractors.   My reason for publishing the Report is thatI see no satisfactory alternative, as I have explained above, to giving it to the unions and there is no way of ensuring that some part at least of its contents will not then leak out.    Even if Igive the gist of the evidence and the findings to the unions andthis is obviously essential,  the result will be the same.    Such aleak will form the basis for a whole host of Questions in theHouse and in the end a good deal of the import of the Report willbe squeezed out of us.    This will provide opponents of D.E.L.with a whole series of minor triumphs and will put us in a poorlight not only because of the contents of the Report but becauseof our attempts to suppress it.    The Opposition already know thatthe Report exists and, whether we publish it or not, they willdraw the worst conclusions about its contents when they see that my consequential action is to reduce my D.E.L.  force considerably.8.    On the other hand there are strong arguments againstpublishing the Report at all.    It will be read as convincing evidence that not only my own D.E.L.  but all D.E.L.  isuncompetitive and uneconomical.    The Governments policy asregards D.E.L. in the Local Authority and other fields will be questioned and criticised.   Up and down the country there maywell be a strong movement against D.E.L.  based on prejudiceagainst D.E.L. and in favour of contractors and regardless of thetacts in particular cases.    If these are to be the results of publishing the Mann Report, it can be argued that it would be agreat mistake to publish it.    I appreciate these arguments andnave considered again whether I need to publish the Report at all.-8--CONFIDENTIAL
The broad result of my reconsideration is this:    unless Iran give the unions the Mann Committee Report or so much of itssubstance as to amount to the same in practice, I have no chancewhatsoever of convincing them that an immediate and severereduction in the numbers of D.E.L. is inevitable.    In other words if the Mann Committee Report is to be withheld from theunions, the most that I can hope to do is to persuade them to acquiesce in a policy of gradual run-down - the first alternativementioned in paragraph 2 above.    This means however that we mustabandon for some years ahead all idea of having a really efficient and economical policy as regards the employment of D.E.L. in myMinistry.    It means retreating from the policy which I advocatedto the Industrial Policy Committee and which they have endorsed.I do not see how we can do that.10.   As between giving the unions the Report itself, and giving them what would have to be a very full summary, the arguments arevery strongly in favour of the first course.    The Report wassolely concerned with comparing costs of doing maintenance work by contract and by D.E.L.  and was drafted in a form in which itcould be made public if so desired.    A full summary would not beany safeguard against the leakage of the Report&apos;s most damagingconclusions and would expose us to the charge not only ofinefficiency but of duplicity.   Nor do I think that we could give it to the union leaders on tne basis of their keeping theinformation to themselves and, perhaps, returning their copies tous when they had digested the contents.    This would tend to isolate the union leaders from the men and even if the union leaders accept the arguments as put to them it will be that muchmore difficult for them to carry conviction with their members.11.   If I am right in all this, we must at least show the Reportto the unions.    We must then accept that the Report&apos;s conclusionswill leak out, and will need to be forestalled by a full statement.   My own strong preference would be to publish theReport at the same time as the statement is made.    It would, ofcourse, be my objective to arrange publication in such a way asto limit as far as I possibly can the amount of damage done bypublication.   There is time for a careful study of this duringthe next few weeks when I shall be consulting the unions.    i will gladly consider my colleagues&apos; views and suggestions andI will then put specific proposals to the Committee.    one possibility would be to attach a suitable covering note to allcopies of the Report made available to Parliament, to the press,etc.   The note might bring out, amongst other things, theaction being taken to improve productivity.    Another possibilitywouid be to publish a White Paper about it, though I must saypit I am doubtful about that since we certainly do not want to draw more attention than we need to the Report and to theaction taken on the basis of it.12.   One alternative, for which there are precedents, would be toinclude in my statement a summary of the evidence and theConclusions of the Report, taking the responsibility on myself forffine action which the Government has decided should flow from them,out to be effective, as in the case of the unions, the summarywouici have to be so full as to convey the substance of the Report-itseir.   Eressure for publication would be likely to be intensified.    I could resist this, of course, but since it wouldiLJ?rpected that the difference between my summary and the Report^seif consisted entirely of the mosc damaging evidence which hadf-p&quot; suPPpessed our last state would certainly be worse than ourll   1 feel strongly that this alternative should be rejected.rn KicmctSTiAi
13.   conclusions have reached the following conclusions(a) In order to implement my future policy on D.E.L., as approved by the Industrial Policy Committee, I need to givethe trade unions copies of the Mann Committee Report.(b) Once this has been done I see no sensible alternative but to make the Report public.(c) In doing this we must make very careful arrangementsso as to minimise the impact of the Report and avoidmisunderstandings of it.14,   Proposed action if the Committee agree I will now initiate the necessarydiscussions with the trade unions giving them copies of theReport.   At the same time I will work out detailed proposals forminimising the effects of publishing the Report;    and I will come back again to the Committee with my proposals for this inthe near future.R.J.M.Ministry of Public Building and Works,Lambeth Bridge House, S.E.1.2Cth May,    968-10-
ANNEX copy OP A JLETTER PROM.,THE .FIRST ^SECRETARY OF. STATE. AND, SECRETARYFoiT^employment AND PRODUCTiVITY : TOMKffi MINISTER OP PUBLIC,.BUILDINGmdTorks21st May, 1968$ if ftDue to other pressures I have only just seen your paper in(68)21 /Annex A/about the proposed reduction of theM.P.B.W. ctirect labour force, which was circulated tothe IN Committee the day after you sent me a copy.I have serious reservations about this, which I shallfeel bound to ask Roy Hattersiey to raise when the mattercomes betore the Committee on Home Publicity tomorrow.Although the IN Committee broadly endorsed your proposals this was subject to further consideration of therorm end timing of your proposed statement.    In my view this raises wider issues.    At a time when it is imperative that we secure the willing co-operation of the trade union movement in a drive for greater productivity if we are togive the prices and incomes policy a chance of success, Ivery much doubt the wisdom of a blunt announcement of areduction in your direct labour force.    The unions concerned would oppose such a course bitterly and strike action would have to be expected.    As you know they have muchgreater difficulty in organising workers employed bycontractors   and the change could therefore have asubstantial effect on their membership.    Although you hope to minimise the repercussions on the use of direct labour by local authorities   a straightforward endorsement of theMann Committee&apos;s recommendations would provide those authorities which have recently changed hands with a readyexcuse to &quot;ollowsuit    I believe that there could be a very real risk that the goodwill we are desperately trying to&apos;&apos;oster In the trade union movement generally would bedissipated.    I also think it important not to under estimate the difficulties we would face in Parliament.-11-- /
I would therefore regard it as essential that yourstatement lays the greatest possible emphasis on yourintention, as indicated in paragraph 3 of PH(68)15 to /Annex B/initiate forthwith a strong drive within your directlyemployed labour force for increased productivity.    But,: ifthe Mann Committee&apos;s report is to be used as a spur to the active assistance of the trade unions in this, it will be important not to present the immediate rundown as a faitaccompli.    What I have in mind is that the emphasis shouldbe given to your proposed depot by depot review of thewhole of the work carried out by the directly employedlabour -&quot;orce -with which no doubt you intend that thetrade unions should be closely associated.    As you said inyour IN paper, you cannot at this stage be sure what the outcome will be.    Particularly is this so if it revealsopportunities for. increasing e^ficisncy which should clearly be given a practical trial before men are discharged.&quot;.Moreover I see you have no intention in any case of starting*ny discharges until the end on the year.    I therefore thinkit would he wrong in your present announcement to indicateony decision on the size and timing of redundancies.I do not of course dissent from your proposal that theMann Committee report should be published, and that you should make a statement.    But I think that the terms ofyour statement ought to   be   settled before you make anyfurther move with the trade unions, and I should be glad to be consulted about this.P.S.    I am shortly to publish a booklet entitled&quot;Dealing with Redundancies&quot; which has been hammered out withthe T.U.C. and the C.B.I.    This is to contain a crucialsentence - &quot;A final decision to close a factory or substantiallyreduce the labour force must inevitably be taken bymanagement but, in the normal course of events.; before thisdecision is reached there should be the fullest consultationwith the unions.&quot;   We cannot appear to fall short of this,our own., advice.-12-

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON METHODS OF EXECUTING maintenance and MINOR WORKS IN THE U. K. -  -  -TERMS OF REFERENCEOur terms of reference, promulgated in Heads of Division Circular 3/66 dated 16th March 1966, were intwo parts:-(1)  To examine a fully representative sample of M. P. B. W. maintenance work with a view to establishing as clear a comparison as possible between the cost of executing such work:-(a)   by D. E. L.and       ( b)   by the use of contractors.(2)  To make a detailed examination as to whether or not a simple and effective incentive scheme fordirectly employed labour could be introduced:  and if so what form such a scheme might take.This Report covers part (1).    The second part of the terms of reference will be the subject of a further report.7SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF D. E. L. FORCE IN U. K.According to statistics compiled by the Directorate of Home Services, the Ministry on 31st May 1966 employed- 31, 535 men on works services (excluding Ancient Monuments) in U. K. ;  12, 736 were on B. &amp; C. E. work;14,525 on M. &amp; E. work and 4, 274 on general support duties.    This force performs two main categories of work: the operation of utility services and the execution of maintenance and minor new works.Based on analysis of the results of examination of 25 depots, which is given at Appendix A, we concluded that the distribution of the labour force is broadly as follows:-TABLE ADistributionCategory A, G and its supportSupport to Category B, C, D and Part II*Productive on Category B, C, D and Part IIPart I and its support*Not contributing to the output of the Depot D. E. LTOTAL% oftotal19116424100*For details of these categories, see paragraphs 25(1) and 26(1).4.   Expenditure in 1965/66 on D. E. L. wages and materials totalled  31. 75m. , which compares with  32, 5m.for 1964/65 when the strength of the force was 33, 800 men.TRADE UNION EVIDENCE5.   The Committee met representatives of the Trade Unions who submitted a Paper, reproduced at Appendix B,.. and orally expressed their views as recorded at Appendix C.EXTENT OF INVESTIGATION6.   The Committee gave detailed consideration to the means by which work carried out by direct labour couldbe compared in cost with work of precisely the same nature and extent carried out by contract.    the feasibility of comparing work executed by D. E. L. with what it would have cost under a daywork contractwas rejected on the grounds that (1) it was not possible to have the same work done again and (2) it was unlikely that sufficient jobs could be found of identical nature and working conditions.    (In our previous report it was shown that there was, on average, little net difference in cost between the execution of jobsunder  250 by a daywork contract or by a measured term contract).    Comparison with lump sum contracts in
9.    Our investigations covered:&apos;-(1)   Detailed study of the activities and cost of D. E. L. at a representative cross-section of depots. In!course of our fact finding we surveyed 25 depots, which covered 11. 7% of the total U. K. labour force,The 25 included the nine depots of one complete Area.(2)   Comprehensive examination of overhead costs at Depot, Area, Region and London Headquartersattributable to the employment of D. E. L. and of contractors.(3)   Comparative analysis of the cost to the Exchequer of executing maintenance and minor new works byD. E. L. and by measured term contract at 19 of the depots which were surveyed.   The analysis was abroad geographical basis embracing examination of work totalling about  100,000 including materials(4)   Co-ordination of the reviews of job analysis and overheads at meetings of the Committee, which met17 times, and by Study Groups of Committee members.IDENTIFICATION OF OVERHEAD COSTS10. In parallel with our investigations into the net costs of work executed by D. E. L. and those which wouldhave arisen if the work had been executed under a measured term contract, we carried out a detailed sto ascertain the costs and overheads that should be added to make the two figures for each job comparable11. We reviewed the sources from which on-costs arise through execution of work by D. E. L. and by contractsub-divided into two main divisions:-(1)   Those which are incurred by an employer, whether the Ministry or a contractor, as additional costsdirectly associated with conditions of service of workpeople - although in some instances those forD. E. L. are in excess of that for which a contractor is legally liable.    These are:-SupervisionFaresTools, height and dirty money allowancesGuaranteed weekCalculating and paying wagesFinancingEmployers&apos; National Insurance and Graduated Pensions Scheme ContributionsInsurance on persons, property and fireHolidays with payCompliance with safety regulationsOffice accommodation, stores and storage accommodationIncentive payments to workmen (L e. bonus payments and plus rates)Provision of small tools, scaffolding and other equipment and plantTransport at workProtective clothingTrainingHead Office overheadsEXTENT OP [NVESTIGATION (Contd)was also discarded as the work was not generally suitable for this type of contract. Even if competitive!sum tenders could have boon obtained, they would have involved several contractors in abortive work amexpenditure.As results wore required within a reasonable period of time, it was decided to cost completed worksted by D. E. L. , using depot records of time and wages, and to compare the results with the measured vatof the same work as if it had been executed by a measured term contractor, using as the basis the appro,priate Schedule of Prices and percentage additions applicable to a contract extant in the district at thetiathe work was executed by I). E. L. Overhead costs were calculated and added to each part of the compartThe results of the cost comparison, and the conclusions drawn from it, are given in paragraphs 34-4(5,METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
80WelfareAssisted travelPaid sick leaveSuperannuation and GratuitiesThe above list excludes Selective Employment Tax which was not in operation at the time of our costcomparison exercise.   Redundancy payments are also omitted.(2)  Those which are incurred by the Ministry as departmental overheads arising from the servicing and administration of D. E. L. or contracts:Site accommodation, water, heating, lighting and power (normally provided by the Department without charge to the Contractor).Depot industrial staff engaged in direction and supervision.Professional and technical staff effort at Depot, Area, Region and London Headquarters.Administrative, Executive and Clerical support at Depot, Area, Region and London Headquarters.In our calculations on the last two items, we have used non-industrial staff costs, inclusive of over-heads, supplied by Establishment Division 5.We have excluded from our costing those general departmental overheads at Depot, Area, Region andHeadquarter level which arise in particular trom relationships with occupying Departments, irrespective of the method of executing works services and are therefore common to both D. E. L. and contract methodsof work,CALCULATION OF COST OF WORK EXECUTED BY D. E. L.Selection of Jobs for costingWe examined work dockets for jobs recently completed at 19 Depots and selected a reasonable cross-section.   The work described on the docket had to be suitable for measurement and still wholly visible,which limited the range, particularly of petty items.   As far as possible, we restricted our selection of work to a period of six months prior to our investigation so that it would be easier for supervisorsand staff to remember the details.We were unable to carry out any cost comparison of Category A work and Category B mechanical servicessince wo had no suitable contracts against which to make comparisons. We had hoped to examine agricul-turai work, but could not find work dockets which adequately defined the scope of work executed.Scope of Cost ComparisonThe Committee examined 800 jobs executed by D. E. L. which ranged in value from under  1 to just over 2,000. .Time spentThe hours spent were ascertained by examination of the work dockets.   In the majority of depots visited,it was stated that the policy was to account 100% on dockets for the recorded time of attendance.   Standingtime is absorbed with productive time booked to jobs and we were thus unable from this particularexamination to obtain any factual indication of the efficiency of depot management of D. E. L. in avoidingstanding time between jobs.Wage RatesWe found a marked diversity in rates being paid to industrial staff at the depots we visited, because of agreements made by Departments prior to the merger which have been continued pending review of the pay structure for industrial employees.   As a complete statement of grades and scales of pay was notavailable to the Committee, a schedule covering the majority of rates being paid was prepared
81Wage Kates (Cnnlil)from information supplied by Kstablishinent Division 4 and contained in Industrial Circulars.   This scheduleis reproduced at Appendix D.   Weighted averages were calculated separately for each trade at each Depotand these were used in all our calculations at the rate applicable at the time the work was executed.Additional Payments to D. E. L. in respect of Overtime Working18. We found overtime being worked at each of the depots surveyed.   The extent of it varied from those depotswhere the Superintendent exercised stringent control to minimise overtime to one where men were encourageto work on Sundays, resulting on some occasions in client departments providing staff for Sunday duty tofacilitate.&apos; access by Ministry employees.   At one depot we found overtime being worked not only as a means of increasing take-home pay but also to minimise the use of contractors.1!). Overtime is sometimes essential and we have made appropriate allowances for this, i. e. we have not costedagainst D. K. L. that proportion of the overtime which is attributable to the nature of the work and which wml!therefore have to be paid as an extra to a contractor.20. The results of our depot surveys in respect of overtime working are shown in Appendix E.   Although thefigures reproduced relate only to a particular week, we were assured at each depot that the overtime beingworked was normal practice-, except for one where overtime was worked on alternate weeks and for which aappropriate adjustment lias been made.Bonus payments21.  Some of the D. V.. L. work measured by the Committee had been executed under the bonus system known aaJob Price Contracting, and the amount of bonus payments has been included in our costing.   The cost of operating this system has been determined, and included in the on-cost calculations.   This cost, expressed as a percentage of extra earnings, derived from 2, 858 B, &amp; C. K. and 5, 855 M. &amp; E. job price contracts!!was found to be:Area	B. &amp; C. E.	M. k E.1	G4%	42%2	22%	34%3	87&apos;!&apos;&quot;	77%Further comments on Job Price Contracting will be included in part (2) of this Report.Materials22. Expenditure on materials issued for jobs under  250 in value is not recorded on dockets or other recordsbut is bulked for each depot. Materials costs are recorded for jobs over  250 but the documentation wasnot sufficiently reliable for calculating the net amount incorporated in each job. We therefore assessedthe materials for each individual job by measurement and pricing based on Departmental bulk supply anddiscount contracts. The proportion of the overheads total attributable to materials was found to be 10%of net wages paid.Overheads on D. E. L.23.  In order to determine overhead costs, which we have expressed as a percentage of wages for hours worked, we surveyed 2 5 depots.24. We reviewed the extent to which overheads vary between categories of work, e. g. Category G work make&apos;little demand on depot transport and Category A work requires a relatively small stockholding of &apos;B&apos;stores (i. e. stores issued for incorporation into works services).
25. Our cost comparison exercise related to job sampling mainly in the field of Category B work, on which two-thirds of the D. E. L. force is employed and on which half the maintenance funds are spent.    We excludedfrom our overhead calculations:(1) those not contributing to the output of the depot D, E. L. , e. g. supervising contract work, working asM. T. driver at Regional Headquarters, working as messenger at Area Office.(2) those employed on Category A and G work (in some cases it was not possible to separate these out).The result of this part of our survey is given at Appendix A.26. In calculating overheads we included the following:(1)  industrial staff employed In support of Category B, C, D and Part II work - this includes industrialsupervisory grades, industrial writers (where not filling Clerical Officer or Clerical Assistant posts)and other industrials employed on writing duties;   M, T. drivers;  mess men;  storekeepers, storeslabourers etc.(2) the clerical effort in support of 0. E. L.    at the depot, e. g. handling clock cards, pay and allowances;work dockets, stores orders and issues for use by D. E. L. , industrial staff records.(3) the cost of supervision by professional and technical staff at depots.(4)  the buildings and installed machinery, and holdings of stores used in support of direct labour.(5)  the cost of weekly-rated plant and transport used in support of direct labour.(6)  tool allowances;   allowances for training apprentices;  payments for dangerous and obnoxiousemployment; transport 1. e. car and cycle allowances;  excess rent; payments for attendance at school;  supply and laundering of overalls;  subsistence and re-imbursement of extra fares;  assistedtravel.17. We found it necessary to cost on a general basis:s1   support to direct labour at Area, Regional and Headquarters level;II   annual paid leave;Bpaid sick leave, being the difference between normal pay for basic conditioned hours and benefit drawnKunder National Insurance;St employers1 National Insurance contributions;superannuation and terminal gratuities.Wt The result of this part of our survey and general costing are summarised as follows:

84CALCULATION OF COST OF WORK BASED ON MEASUREMENTMeasurements28. AH measuring was carried out by quantity surveying staff familiar with Priced Schedules and experienced in the preparation of associated final accounts.    It was arranged that depot staff who hadsupervised the D. E. L. should assist in identifying the work executed.    We gave instructions that if any doubt existed as to the extent of the work described on the docket, the job was not to be included in thecost comparison.Pricing of Measured Work29. The work was, in the main, priced on the basis of an existing term contract, covering the same area andconditions of working, which had been awarded after competitive tendering for percentages on or off theappropriate Schedules of Prices.30. In three cases where an appropriate contract did not exist, estimated percentages based on local knowledgehave been used in the cost comparison.Confirmation of figures used in cost comparison31. After the Committee received the details of D. E. L. costs and the corresponding figures based onmeasurement, we re-visited the depots and discussed the details of the cost comparison with the quantitysurveying and depot supervisory staff and charge-hands concerned, examining the work where doubtexisted.    We eliminated samples if doubts of any kind remained.Overheads on executing work by Measured Term Contract32. All overheads incurred by a contractor are included in the Schedule of Prices and its percentage addition,which forms the basis of the contract.33. Departmental overhead costs have been calculated and expressed as a percentage of the total contractpayment on the basis of measurement, and are shown overleaf for each depot.

RESULTS OF COST COMPARISON U U34   The sample of 700 jobs in the cost comparison exercise was made at random, subject only to the criteriamentioned previously, i. e, the work had to be suitable for measurement, still wholly visible and, where possible, carried out by D. E. L. in the period of six months prior to our investigation.35   When analysed, the results of the random sampling showed that the relative cost of work done by D. E. L.and by contract varies considerably with the size of the work item.   In each of the size ranges, up to  10, 10- 50, and over  50 the total D. E. L. cost exceeded the comparable total measured value plus M. P. B. W.overheads.   The largest difference was in jobs under  10 i.n value, for which, in the case of B, &amp; C. E.work, the total D. E. L. cost was nearly 150% and, for Electrical work, about 2 50% above the comparablemeasured value.   However, this was not considered to be a fair comparison, as a contractor would clearly require a much higher percentage if all his work was on petty jobs.   Similarly, he could quote a lower percentage if he knew the work would be confined to medium or large sized jobs.36. At the time the sample was made, most of the existing B. &amp; C. E. term contracts were for work in the range  0- 2, 500 per job.   Under current procedure, minor maintenance in the range of  0- 250 per jobwill normally be executed by daywork term contract, the use of measured term contracts being confined tojobs over  250 in value.   This means that contract percentages on the new measured term basis can beexpected to be lower because of the exclusion of petty jobs;   the extent of these is shown by an analysis at three depots where over a period of 12 months 94% of the orders placed on  0- 2, 500 measured term con-tracts were for under  250 each and these petty jobs accounted for 65% of the gross value of orders raised.37. To ensure that the sample was as fully representative as possible, it was decided to weight the size rangein the random selection to accord with the spread of job size which a contractor could have expected whenquoting his percentage addition to the Schedule Rates - the resultant overall comparisons are considered tobe more reliable than separate figures for each job size.   We assessed the proportion of work undertaken by term contractors in the three size categories under  10,  10-E50 and over  50 as follows:-Job Value      B. &amp; C. E.       Painting    ElectricalUnder  10 12% - 2% 10- 50 15% - 33%Over  50 73% 100% 65%38. In respect of painting work the spread of job values in our cost comparison exercise was insufficient toproduce weighted averages.39. Table D shows the results of the cost comparison.   The sample of B. &amp; C. E. work was made at 17 depotsand comprised 570 separate jobs of work, the extremes in size being under  1 to two of over  2, 000 each.At three depots, a total of 46 painting jobs carried out by D. E. L. were measured and priced as if they hadbeen executed by a local term contractor using the locally applicable Painting Schedule,   At seven depots,a total of 84 electrical jobs carried out by D. E. L. were measured and priced as if by a local term con-tractor using the locally applicable Electrical Schedules.

The cost comparison shows the differences, in the samples chosen, between the labour and material!and overheads of D. E. L. and the comparable expenditure if the work had been executed by term contract,The comparison shows that substantial differences exist, but it does not demonstrate how these arise,While the measured value represents accurately the price which the Ministry would have paid for comparSjwork to that carried out by D. E. L. it is not possible to derive from it separate figures for the wages aoverheads actually incurred by a contractor.   To make this comparison, it would have been necessaryto I ask contractors to carry out work already done by D. E. L. , or similar to it, and to time the work as it mlbeing done, and such an exercise was considered impractical for the reasons given earlier in the Report&apos;see paragraph 6.41.  It is possible, however, to calculate for B. &amp; C. E. work the allowances in the W. D. Schedule of Price&apos; i(the basis of B. &amp; C. E. term contracts) for the labour element of each measured rate.   The results ofthese calculations are show in the analysis overleaf.
TABLE EANALYSIS OF B. &amp; C. E. WORK88Basic wages at 1960 rates	D. E. L.  	Labour Element in Schedule  	Excess of D. E. L. over Schedule	19, 776	12,432	59%42. To provide comparable figures, the D. E. L. docket time was re-priced at the National Joint Council ratespayable by contractors in April 1960, L e. the same level as those used in the W. D. Schedule.   This was done to provide a clearer comparison, especially as there is an astonishing lack of consistency between therates paid at different depots and many depots pay rates in excess of those agreed nationally for the industry.The D. E. L. overtime and bonus were also separated out as these payments would be included in the contractpercentage on the measured value side, if incurred by the contractor.43. While the &quot;basic wages&quot; on the D. E. L. side accurately reflect the time taken, the comparable figure on the term contract side is calculated from the labour elements in the W. D. Schedule.   It is possible that if acontractor considers the rates in the Schedule, generally or for any particular trade, to be high or low forthe operations described he may allow for this in the percentage which he quotes on or off the Schedule.   the term contract &quot;basic wages&quot; would not then be a completely accurate measure of productivity in comparisonwith the wages incurred by D. E. L.   The contract percentage, however, has to include for all increased costs of labour and materials since 1960, for an assessment of future increases during the three year period of contract, for any overtime, bonus or plus rates and for all plant, overheads and profit as well as for anydistance and access difficulties to sites.   An assessment has been made of the overheads likely to be incurred by a term contractor and amounts to an addition of about 45% upon the rates in the Schedule,exclusive of profit and of any allowance for special local conditions.   The average contract addition for thesample depots is 52% (8 below and 9 above) and as this also includes for the contractor^ profit it is unlikely to contain any substantial element of uplift to the labour constants.&quot;44. The analysis shows that, in the sample, basic wages of D. E. L. were 59% above the assessed wages cost onthe measured side;  D. E. L. costs other than basic wages were 28% higher.45. Since the cost comparisons were carried out, the term contracts at two of the depots were re-tendered andnew contracts arranged at reduced percentages - at 40% in lieu of 87. 5% at one and at 59. 5% in lieu of 72% atthe other.P. It is not possible to prepare a similar analysis for Electrical work or Painting as no build-up exists of therates in the Schedules for these trades.DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DEPOTSM. The results of depot sampling have been aggregated to show an average trend but there were wide differences in depot D. E. L. performance.   These would arise from:-(1)     differences in the efficiency of D. E. L. and of its management(2)     differences in depot overheads as may be seen from table (B)(3)    differences in the term contract percentage(4)    differences in the size and nature of jobs in the samples.At most depots more than one of these factors are involved.In 14 out of 17 depots the D. E. L. costs for B. &amp; C. E. work were above the comparable cost by contract.At three depots, D. E. L. costs were less than the measured value.   At one where in the sample D. E. L.1 was cheaper by 13% the cost of the D. E.&apos; L. basic wages was 21% higher than the assessed cost of the termncontractor^ wages but this was offset by a very high contract percentage.   At another, the work consisted&quot;&apos; repetitive modernisation which kept the same team of D. E. L. fully occupied (and earning overtime) on
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DEPOTS (Contd)exactly the same type of work.    There is little doubt that a contractor would offer a lower percentage forthis repetitive work if tenders were invited.49.  At most depots the labour element cost at April I960 basic wage rates was considerably in excess of the valof the labour element for the same work in the W. D. Schedule.    In fact, nearly two thirds of the total is   iin excess by 30% or more.50.  At some depots, part of this difference might be due to time taken up in obtaining access to buildings or Incomplying with security regulations, which on the term contract side would be included in the contractor^percentage addition.    It is unlikely, however, that the amount involved would be large.    One depot visitedhad strict security precautions including the locking up of all buildings and the clearing up of materials and plant during work breaks - the term contractor had included 6 z.% in his contract percentage for all these3delays.51.  Idle time between jobs, a reflection of poor management, might also contribute to the difference.    At mostdepots, as has been mentioned earlier, it was the rule for standing time to be absorbed with productivetime booked to jobs.    The term contractor is not likely to tolerate delays between jobs.52. It was said at one or two of the depots that the quality of the work was better when executed by D. E. L, andthis was given in explanation of the time taken.    If this is so, it may be that the quality is better than is strictly necessary, or it may reflect on the Ministry&apos;s supervision of work done by term contractors, whoare paid for the quality specified and approved.53.  The comments on differences between depots in the B. &amp; C. E. sample also apply to the Painting and electrical samples.    Out of 3 depots sampled for Painting work, 2 had D. E. L. costs well above the comparable cost by contract.    Out of 7 depots sampled for Electrical work 4 showed D. E. L. costs in excess of comparable cost by contract.CAUSES OF UNCOM PETITIVE D. E. U PERFORMANCE54. The Committee considers that the major part of the difference in the cost of work executed by D. E. L, andby contractors is indicative of lower average performance by the direct labour system. Among the factor which may contribute to this are:-(1)    The lack of incentive for good management, such as is provided by the profit margin of termcontractors.(2)    The lack of any check, where there is no bonus scheme, on whether the time taken is reasonable forthe work done - time after time, charge hands were unable to explain why work had taken so long.(3)   The difficulty of dismissing inefficient personnel, especially if they are established.    Typical of the comments on this was that of a Depot Superintendent who said that he would rather tolerate bad worktthan go through the prolonged procedures involved in dismissal.(4)    Stricter enforcement of safety regulations - it was alleged that painting term contractors frequentlyworked without scaffolding.(5)   Stricter adherence to customs such as that of mates accompanying tradesmen, even if there is no woifor the mate to do.(6) The absence of an effective incentive bonus scheme for the men. Nevertheless if a bonus scheme liintroduced the increased productivity must more than pay for the cost of operating it if the gap is to1closed.(7)   The high average age of the operatives.
CONCLUSION9055. The present exercise covered a very much wider sample than in the previous enquiry but the conclusion reached is the same as in the previous  Report:        .. the inferences from these exercises lead to theconclusion that the employment of direct labour is not competitive with the use of contractors&quot;.K, a MANNChairmanW.

MINISTRY OF PUBLIC BUILDING- AND EORKSDEPARTMENTAL JOINT INDUSTRIAL COUNCIL(TRADE UNION SIDE)Secretary!L. T. WilliamsPhone sMACaulay 23629-11 Maoaulay RoadClapham,S.W.4.SUBMISSIONS TO THE MANN committee by THE TRADE union SlDfl Off THEMINISTRY OF PUBLIC BUILDING AND WORKS, D.J.I.C.Employment of Direot -labour the Trade Union Side of the D.J.J..U. have for many years pressed theOfficial Side to oontinue and expand the employment of direct lahour incarrying out its varied activities.    The Department have taken the view andthe Trade Union Side thinka this is not unreasonable, that costs must enterinto any deoision as to the use of directly employed labour or outsidecontractors.    The Trade Union Side, however, have never been satisfied withthe methods of oosting whioh are used in establishing whether direotlyemployed labour is cheaper or more expensive than contractors.    It has tobe borne in mind that when a contractor submits a tender for oarrying outwork he has to take into account his own direct labour oosts plus his on-oosts and plus &amp; certain percentage for profit.     Costs of materials may also be taken into consideration where theae are supplied by the contractor.It is the view of the Trade Union Side that whatever figure is submitted by a contractor account should be taken of the costs of theMinistry&apos;s administrative machine $ because wherever a job is done? therewill he a Ministry Depot or establishment complete with non-industrial staffincluding Clerk of Works, Superintending Engineers, Draughtsmen, ClericalGrades ate? and the cost of these has to be borne, of course, out of publiefunds.    Where directly employed labour is used, the Trade Union Side wouldlike to know what &apos;on-eosts&apos; are added to the wages of the industrial staffplus the oost of the material and equipment used in oarrying out the task.If the oost of the non-industrial staff is added to the job undertaken bythe industrial staff? then we should like to know what percentage is added?
as depending on this figure the use of directly employed industrial staffoould be mads competitive or otherwise.     In other words tha Trade union side are arguing whichever way a job is done the non-industrial staff ofthe Ministry have to be carried.In looking at the summary of recommendations which were issued to theTrade Union Side on the 17th March, 1966, wo feel that 1. and 2. should read as follows!-1.     iBirployment mof Direct labour^Direct Labour should bs employed ons-(,a)   Building and Civil Engineering operating services on a planned maintenance basis.(,b)   Mechanical and Electrical operating services on a planned maintenance basis.(a)   Emergency services at all establishments.The above to operate where this would give full employment to thegroup of trades required^2.     Wherever possible the supervision of direct labour should be improved by better planning of their work and this, in the Trade union side&apos;s view, devolves great responsibility upon local, and ares and perhaps regional management in undertaking more efficient planning ofthe work-load under their oontrol.3.     The Trade Union Side take the view that the extension ofinoentive schemes to all depots would result in a much more effioientuse of directly employed labour and would also stimulate management in securing the most efficient method of carrying out work.    We believe it would be possible for a central estimating team to be established in areas, who could in fact agree with the workpeople&apos;s representatives on the prices or times which should be allowed for carrying out theneoessary work.4.    With regard to new works, the Trade Union Side take the view thatthe Ministry should have a department for any work which is put out to&quot;tender&quot; and should be able to submit a &quot;tender&quot; for completing thework in the same manner as ia done by private contractors.    We
94understand this system ia operating in a number of cities, one example wehave being Sheffield, where the Publio Works Department of the Corporationboo been able to oompete on very favourable terms with outside privatecontractors.This also applies in tho Greater London Area where the Greater london council has a Contracts Department who undertake building and engineeringworks on a &quot;tender&quot; basis.The Trade Union Side are prepared to aooept that under presentcircumstances the employment of contractors may be occasionally necessaryto obviate s &quot;casual&quot; labour force.     We naturally do not want a situationwhere labour can be reoruited and discharged merely to moat fluctuations inthe work-load.    Nevertheless, we are convinced that with proper planning the Ministry could successfully carry out all its maintenance services by direct labour and a large amount of new work by the same method.5.    The Trade Union Side would like to supplement the above statement byoral evidenoe to the Committee where wq could quote examples of what wethink are inefficient practices in relation to the use of contractors.TRADE UNION SIDEM.O.P.B. &amp; W.27th July, 1966
Mr. Mann welcomed the Trades Union representatives, and referred to theirwritten evidence which had already been studied by the Committee.   He invitedthem to present any additional aspects of the matter which might now requireto be brought into foous and considered.Mr. Ambrose said that whereas the Trade Union side of the D.J.I.C. acceptedthe necessity for getting work done in the most economical way, they had long been uneasy about the methods used to determine the cost of carrying out tasksby D.E.L.   They felt that Government Departments could not be expected to havethe same organisation for arriving at true costs as a oontraotor had, and thaton-oosts added to the basic wages and materials might be unrealistic.   Whenthey had seen the terms of referenoe of this Committee, it was realised thatthese oovered exactly the points on which the Trade Union side were seekingreassuranoe from the Ministry.Mr, Mann explained that the examinations of evidence of oost now in handwere based on facts and not opinions, and that the information was being obtained at depot level from records ordinarily made in the course of normal procedures.A sample of 25 depots had been surveyed, covering the whole range of every typeof depot and the wage rates used for costing were those in force at theparticular depot at the time the work was done.   He stressed that the committee note of a Meeting held on 22nd September 1966 - - - -Present:   Mr. K.C. Mann,     Chairman of Maintenance Methods committee mr. W. Andrew      )Mr. R.C. Geall     )Mr. H.J. Giles     )   Members of committee mr. N.P. GoldsMr. N.C. hughes mr. E.R.Parrinder)Mr. L.Middleton Smith, Assistant Secretary, E.D.if mr. J.F.

Batcheler, Secretary, Committee on Methods ofExecuting Maintenance
attaohed great importance to looking at work carried out at a recent date,so that people concerned with it oould be expected to remember the details and point out the work if necessary.   In reply to a question from Mr, Williams,Mr, Giles assured him that individual work-people as well a3 supervisory staff were being asked about specific jobs.After Mr. Middleton Smith had explained the reason for his presence andthat of the Secretary of the D.J.I.C. (to ensure continuity of communication)he said in reply to a question from Mr, Williams that all work in supplies division was excluded from the activities of this Committee, since the termsof reference limited the field of enquiry to the Directorate General of WorksU.K. organisation.   Mr. Ambrose then outlined three points which were causingooncern to the Trade Union Side because of their possible effect upon thecost of work as recorded:-(l)   use of D.E.L. to rectify errors or do again work incorrectlyexecuted by contractorss   were firms surcharged with this cost?(2)   use by contractors of Ministry&apos;8 plant normally used by D.E.L.e.g, joinery machinery and lathes, concrete mixers:   werecharges made for this facility?(3)    &quot;labour only&quot; contractors - a new development in industry:was there any intention to introduce them on Ministry work?Referring to (l) Mr, Mann replied that his Committee were carrying outexercises to determine the cost of work where executed by D.E.L. compared withthe same work if executed by contract.   Thus the oost of rectifying errors orbad workmanship were not strictly the concern of his Committee.   Mr. Middleton Salobserved that work done by D.E.L. after contractors had left a site or building was often due to minor changes of plan on the part of the Ministry or olientdepartment.In respeot of (2) Mr. Mann said, and Mr. Middleton Smith endorsed, that plantused on works was debited against the cost of the job at rates of hirepromulgated by the Ministry and in the case of contractors hire charges wererecovered by deduction from their accounts.
Cases of   unreoorded uae of Departmental plant and equipment by contractorshad not come to the notice of the Committee and in any event such cases wouldnot invalidate the oost comparison exeroises which assume that contractors have provided their own plant.   Account is taken of any services provided free to acontractor under the terras of his contract by adding an overhead charge onthe contract oosting.Mr. Nockles pointed out that the third item had been raised on the D.J.I.C.some time previously, taken up with the Director of Contracts and settled tothe satisfaction of the T.n. side.Mr. Cole then said he wished to submit an additional document from the electrical Trades Union, some aspects of which were covered in the general statement already made.   He pointed out that the Trades Unions were as muchoonoerned with matters affecting their members in the employ of contractorsas those in the Ministry.   He was critical of the paperwork involved in givinginstructions for executing day-to-day maintenance compared with practice inoutside firms, which he felt must add to the on-costs attributed to D.E.L.Mr. Cole then pointed out that members of his Union whether working for outsidefirms or the Ministry do not participate in payment-by-results schemes, whereasother trades do.     He went on to question the recommendations of the FirstCommittee, and in particular the implications of that which recommended thereduction of D.E.L. in the long term, and remarked upon the high average age ofthe Ministry&apos;a employees.Mr, Mann in reply said that while his first Committee had reoommended intheir Report immediate aotion to achieve a planned reduction on the long term,it had been the committee view that if the Department had aooepted therecommendation the run-down would be a phased operation.After some discussion about incentive bonus schemes, during whioh Mr. Mannexplained that this part of the Committee&apos;8 task was still before it, andMr. Ambrose mentioned his colleagues&apos; misgivings about the Government departments in which suoh schemes existed being properly geared to achieve maximum efficiency and consequent benefit to employees, Mr. Mann summed up the view of the Committeethat if any scheme were feasible at all, it must pay for itself and promote a permanent increase in productivity.Mr. Ambrose thanked the Chairman for receiving the delegation, whose members then withdrew.

100OVERHEAD ON D.E.L. IN RESPECT OF INDUSTRIALS IN support for each depot visited the number of industrials in various grades who wereBupporting the men engaged on productive work in Maintenance CategoriesB, C and D and in some cases on Part II work was determined mainly by cross-examination of junior technical grades and senior industrial supervisory grades.The time of supervisory grades had to be split in those cases where somesupervision of contractors&apos; labour was involved, where they spent time on dutiessuch as inspection of married quarters at changes of occupancy, where time was spent in operating a planned maintenance system, and where some work was done attheir trade. Only the time spent in supervising, supplying stores, arranging and controlling the work has been included as in support of the D.E.L. on productivework.With motor transport drivers, care was taken to exclude any time spent servingnon-industrial staff, supporting Categories A and C or Part I works, and inmessengerial, post or other runs not in support of D.E.L.Stores effort in support of various categories of work and, where applicable,in supplies to contractors was assessed, and only the proportion of industrial staffgin stores appropriate to the number of productive workers being analysed has beentaken.Industrials in support include those men employed cleaning workmen1s messrooms, toilets, and workshops, but not those cleaning non-industrial offices.   Inmany oases &quot;green card&quot; men are employed on this class of work.Men on writing duties are only included if not filling a Clerical Offioer orClerioal Assistant post on the depot clerical complement.As the number of industrials in support is relatively small compared with thenumber of produotive workers, a few on leave or sick in the week under examinationoould unduly affoot the proportion, therefore wages for a full week for absenteeswere added to support and produotive worker&apos;3 wages paid for hours worked to giT&apos;the results shown in columns (e) and (f) in the following table.The ratio of these does not give the true overhead for industrials in supportbeoause the support men themselves incur overheads due to paid leave, employer&apos;8N.I. contributions, etc, and wages for support must be enhanced by the appropriat
overheads before dividing by the wages for produotive workers.The following overheads were considered appropriate and have been used in the table!Paid Leaves   In full 7$Paid Sick Leaves   In full 2.9$ .\Employees N.I.

AFfEWDjyjjQVKtHKAD ON D.E.L. ARISING FROM THE TRAINING OF      &apos;i s 2APPRENTICES AND WC-RKfelgJThe cost of training apprentices is not fully or oorreotly covered by thewages paid whilst at oollege on day release plus apprentice training allowanoejpaid to craftsmen in the week surveyed, since day release only occurs in termtime and there are periodic payments of tuition and examination fees to betaken into account.2.     In the case of apprentices in their early years there is little return forthe wages paid, and loss of productivity per year has been assessed on adescending scale as follows:-1st year - 100$ loss including time at school or college2nd year -   60$    &quot; &quot; &quot;     &quot;      &quot;      &quot;      &quot;3rd year -   30$     &quot; &quot; &quot;     &quot;      &quot;      &quot;      &quot;4th year -   20$&quot; &quot; &quot;     &quot;      &quot;      &quot;      &quot;5th year -   20$     &quot; &quot; &quot;     &quot;      &quot;      B      &quot;Taking the pay for these years and multiplying by the loss, the average lossper year per boy is  190 approximately.3e     Typical fees payable at Technical Colleges are  5 for tuition *  J 10s. Od,for examination fees over 18 years of age and  3 for tuition *  3 10s. Od. for examination fees under 18 years of age.   Examination fees are paid on twooocasiona only, therefore the average annual fee payment is  5 15s. Od. perapprentice.4* Cost of books and excess fares can be claimed but average for these is low and is assessed at 10s. per year per boy.5. Apprentices are issued with meal vouchers value 2s. 6d. per day when under18, and value 1s. 3d. per day when over 18 and under 19, giving an average ooatof  21 per year per boy.6.    Apprentice allowance at the rate of 10s. per week is payable to craftsmenon Government rates of pay instructing the boys and the average annualis assessed as  24.7.    The total average cost per apprentice is therefore 190 *  5 15s. Od. * 10s. *  21 *  24 &quot;  241 5s. Od. per year or 4 12s. Od. per week.
APPENDIX M8.    Thin figure has been used to assess the training oost of apprentices indepots where all facilities are available, and lower figures as appropriatehave been assessed for other depots.9.    Adults on day release attend college during term times only, therefore the wages paid have been reduced to ^ of the wages paid in the week examined,and 3/3d. per man has been added to cover the average weekly oost of fees.10.

1.     The minimum annual leave allowance for industrial employees is two weeks,After 12 years qualifying service this is increased by half a week from thebeginning of the following leave year.2.     foremen of trades, foremen fitters, foremen refrigeration, foremenelectricians, ohargemen and leading men are entitled to three weeks annual leave,3.    Annual leave is paid for at plain time rates for the normal working hoursof the day, days or week for which leave is requested.     Leave is recorded inhours, and for the purpose of converting the leave scales(.1)   &quot;a week&quot; means the conditioned weekly hours of the grade,excluding overtime and meal breaks,(2J   for part-time employees &quot;a week&quot; means the normal weeklyhours which they contract to work.4.    The conditioned hours of the majority of employees are 40 per week,exclusive of meal breaks, and taking the generality of employees and the exceptions into account, it can be reckoned that, on average, annual paid loaveaooounts for 82 hours per annum per employee.5-     In addition, eight and a half days in the year (compared with six in thebuilding and oivil engineering etc. industries are paid holidays for theMinistry&apos;s industrial employees, amounting on average to 68 hours per annum.We thus arrive at an average figure of 150 hours (3^ weeks generally speaking]paid leave per employee per annum.6.     Up to three days&apos; paid special leave may be granted by a depotsuperintendent for various personal reasons, i.e. bereavement, domestic distress)or marriage, while a greater amount for trade union or local government dutiesmay be granted by Establishment Division 4-7.    The overhead arising from paid leave oan be expressed as a percentage ofwages paid for hours worked as8. Our depot surveys ehow a weekly average per man of 49&apos;3 hours paid forwork done.9.

OVERHEAD ON D.E.L. ARISING FROM PAID SICK LEAVE1.    At the Committee&apos;a request. accounts Division processed the induetrialpayroll now being handled by computer methods (7*342 accounts) over a reoentperiod of 12 months to ascertain the amount paid out by the Ministry under theScheme of Paid Sick Leave for Government Industrial Employees.2.    sick  pay was found to be 2,Tjb of the gross wages paid.3.    Of the 25 Depots surveyed the gross wages paid were made up as follows!- Wages paid for hours worked 35*144Paid for leave 1*153Paid for sick absenoe 930Paid for aohool absences 179Allowances 482 37*8884.    Expressed as a percentage of wages paid for hours worked the overheadV7 883arising from paid sick  leave is therefore 2.7 x ^3 144    2.95*&quot;5.    It was also necessary to determine the period of time which this siokpayment represents in order to assess the average nett number of working weeksfor each man.    This was done by calculating, from our survey figures, theaverage sick  leave payment for 40 hours under the soheme after national insurance Benefit deductions had been made, and also the average nett paymentper week for hours worked.    The average weekly payment to a man on paid sickleave was  7 10s. Od and the average weekly payment for hours worked  15 Os. Od.sick  payments in a year amounted to  15 x 52 x       *  22 6e.

OVERHEAD ON D.E.L. ARRISING FROM superannuation and GRATUITIES1,    We were informed by Establishment Division 2 that the Treasury is carryingout a full scale review to determine the Government8a liability in respeot of superannuation and   gratuities to industrial civil servants, and that in themeantime Treasury assessed this on-ooat aa 15$ of the total wages bill.2,    It will be seen from Appendix Q paragraph 3 that the ratio of gross wages paid to wages paid for hours worked is deduced from our depot surveys as37888 : 35144.   On this basis the overhead on D.E.L, arising from superannuation and gratuities   is 15 x 37888 a 16.2$ of wages paid for hours worked.35144
SiAPPENDIX TOVERHEADS IN RESPECT OP INDUSTRIAL SUPERVISORY STAFF EMPLOYEDIN SUPPORT OF CONTRACT WORKIn response to a questionnaire issued by the Committee to all RegionalDireotors, Under Secretary, Scotland and Director of Works, London, factowere collated regarding the time spent by industrial supervisory staff insupport of contract work - seldom was a man engaged full time on such duties.The oost of industrials in support of contract work (all methods of execution) was found to be, expressed as a percentage of contract expenditure:Mi run.

Even at Depot I there wasroom for dealing with more orders as there was some needless effort being spent onkeeping extra records of each order.The average overhead figure of 1.65$ was considered to be a fair one to usein the cost comparison exercise.CLERICAL STAFFThree depots were selected y/here the estimated annual expenditure on work done by measured term contracts amounted to about  100,000, and where the amountof work done on daywork term contracts was small.Tho value and number of orders paid in 1965/66 was calculated at each depotand the clerical and typing effort in relation to these was assessed by talkingto the Depot Superintendents and the staff concerned.   The procedure to befollowed was laid down in desk instructions which had been issued by the AreaOffice based on D.I.C. Circulars No.1 and No.9.

APPENDIX X&quot; ^ ^ ^    1 &apos;OVERHEAD ON MEASURED TERM CONTRACTS APISING FROM SITE ACCOMMODATIONETC. PROVIDED BY THE MINISTRY WITHOUT CHARGE TO THE CONTRACTOR1.     Information was obtained from Area Quantity Surveyors on the floor spaceallocated free of charge to firms with term contracts, the basis of which hadbeen used in the cost comparison.2.     Area Quantity Surveyors were also asked to furnish information as to theannual expenditure on each of the contracts involved.3.     The areas were valued at rates comparable to those used in the calculations of the similar overhead on D.E.L.4.    We were then able to express the overheads as:-Annual post of Building        x 100Annual expenditure on ContractThe percentages were then applied as a overhead on eaoh contract atthe particular depot where it was used in the cost comparison, as set out below:-		ESTIMATED		OVERHEAD	TYPE OF CONTRACT	ANNUAL COST                ANNUAL		DEPOT		OF BUILDINGS  	EXPENDITURE ON CONTRACTS	t X 100II	B. &amp; C.E.

OVERHEADS IN CONCEPTION WITH THE MEASUREMENT OF -7 qMEASURED TERM CONTRACT work.    The measurement of term contract work is shared between private quantitysurveyors and the Ministry&apos;s own quantity surveying staff.2.    The scales of fees for private quantity surveyors ares-B. &amp; C.E. Work4ft on orders up to  2S500.3l ft on orders over  2,500 with a minimum fee of  100 for any order.These percentages allow for examining and certifying claims for payments on account when requested and for all travelling and out-of-pocket expenses.Painting Work only4ft on all orders.This percentage allows for examining and certifying claims for payments on account and for all travelling and out-of-pocket expenses.Internal electrical wiring of Buildings3^ on value of measured work on a single station ordered on a termoontract or a contract arranged specially for that station.4ft on value of measured work on more than one station based on aseries of orders placed on term contracts.iflb on value of interim certificates.2%fa on aggregate value of increases and decreases under variation of prioe clauses.Expenses at rates of standard soaleo3.     In addition to the foregoing fees, there are Ministry costs in appointingthe private surveyor, payment of fees  and a small amount of time expended bythe Area and Regional Quantity Surveyors.     It is estimated that this would notexoeed 0.25ft.4.    When the measuring of term oontraots is carried out by Ministry staff thapolioy is that staff costs and overheads should not exoeed the fee that wouldhave been paid to a private quantity surveyor.5.    Taking into consideration all the foregoing information, 4.25ft has been used in the oost comparison to cover the oosts of measuring term contract work.
