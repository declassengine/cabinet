jlOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC IviAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT)C(68) 7315th May, 1968;opy NO.CABINETsociaj]RVICES:  RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE EAR:DAYS OF SICKNESSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Family Allowances and National Insurance Bill (which inter alia increases family allowances by 3s. Od. from October next) was givenits Second Reading on 2nd April;  but Committee Stage has been deferred pending a final decision on the future of Clause 2, which would abolishpayment of national insurance benefit for the first three days of sicknessor unemployment.    It is now necessary to decide whether to retain or towithdraw this Clause, so that the Bill can start its Committee Stage next week.background,      On 11th January the Cabinet (CC(68) 4th Conclusions, Minute 3)invited me to consider with the Minister of Social Security the possibilityof making reductions in social security expenditure to offset the continuing cost of a further increase in family allowances (beyondthe 7s. Od. increase already announced for April).3,       On 13th January the Minister wrote to me offering savings on two fronts.    One was the limitation of unemployment benefit foroccupational pensioners in the light of the Report of the national insurance Advisory Committee which has now been published.     Theother was that benefit for the first three days of sickness or unemployment(at present payable retrospectively if the beneficiary is sick or umemployed for 12 days) should cease to be payable at all.     The Minister estimatedthat, after allowing for all the side effects of other social security benefits, this v/would  save  15 million in the first full year, and morethereafter as the level of benefit and the number of beneficiaries increased.4.       On 5th March (CC(68) 17th Conclusions, Minute 2) this proposal was approved by the Cabinet as part of a package deal including also agreement to increase family allowances by 3s. Od. a week from October, 1968.    Iannounced the decision in my Budget Speech, and it was embodied in clause 2 of the Family Allowances and National Insurance Bill publishedthe next day.5,       Opposition to the introduction of three absolute waiting days quicklydeveloped; and on 2nd April the Cabinet considered (CC(68) 25th conclusions minute 2) a memorandum (C(68) 65) by the Minister of Social Security andthe Chief Secretary, Treasury.    Summing up the discussion, the PrimeMinister said that &quot;the Cabinet, on balance, took the view that the
CONF1DENT1ALMinister should make a general statement on the Second Reading of theBill, indicating that the Government were reviewing their policy in thismatter against the background of the growth of employers1 sick payschemes and the introduction of earnings-related short-term benefits,and would be entering into full consultation with the Trades UnionCongress (TUG) and the Confederation of British Industry (C3I);   andthat, in the meantime, the Committee Stage of the Bill would be deferred.It would be necessary, however, to make it clear that savings to offset the cost of the increase in family allowances would have to be achieved by one means or another;  and they should leave open the possibility of retaining the existing clause if the discussions proved abortive&quot;.Consultations with the TUC and the CBI6.       Since then the Lord President and the Minister have begunconsultations with the TUC and the CBI about the possibility of transferringresponsibility for support of workers during the first weeks of sicknessfrom the National Insurance Fund to employers.     The hope was that theabolition of benefit for the three waiting days could be submerged in thislarger proposal.    It is now clear, however, that there is no prospect of reaching agreement to this transfer of responsibility during the next fewmonths and that accordingly there is no chance of achieving any savingsat all from it in 1969-70, let alone in the current financial year.     TheLord President and the Minister will, however, be continuing thediscussions with a view to a transfer of responsibility in the longer term, since clearly the arrangements under the existing earnings -related sickness scheme are over-generous to both sides of industry.Other possibilities7,      The Lord President and the Minister have also considered., withthe Chief Secretary, whether there are any alternative savings whichcould be found in the social services field if Clause 2 were withdrawn and the proposal to abolish payment for waiting days were abandoned.The only possibility which has emerged is that the present payment of waiting days under the State scheme might be restricted to those people who are not covered by an employees scheme of sick pay.     This mightsave up to  6 million in a full year, less some increase in adrxiinistrativecosts.    However, it would involve considerable administrative difficul-ties; would require large numbers of additional staff;  would require futher consultation with the TUC and CBI;  and might lead to theabandonment or modification of private schemes by employers who now operate them.   i therefore do not feel able to press for the adoptionof tnis course,The future of Clause 28.      We are therefore forced back to consideration of Clause 2,There are good arguments for retaining it:(a) It was part of the package deal involving an increase in family allowances, to which v/e are now committed.(b) The savings have been written into the forward estimates ofpublic expenditure, and the need to secure them has become even more necessary since the latest forecasts suggest that the announced limits for public expenditure in 1968-69 and 1969-70 will be exceeded byconsiderable margins.
(c)    The abolition of payment for waiting days has merit in the avoidance of duplication between the national insurance scheme and occupational sickpay schemes.Nevertheless, I have reached the reluctant conclusion that in presentcircumstances the political case against trying to force the existingClause 2 through the House is overwhelming.9,      I am prepared therefore to agree to the withdrawal of Clause 2and the retention of the existing arrangements for the three waiting days.The cost of this concession, compared with the present forecasts ofpublic expenditure, would be  15 million in 196-9-70 - the first full year - and something less in 1968-69;  and it is essential thatcorresponding savings should be found elsewhere in the field ofpublic expenditure.     This matter can conveniently be subsumedin the general review of future public expenditure which we shallbe undertaking next month.     My colleagues will note that this caseillustrates the dangers of incurring firm commitments to expenditurein return for hypothetical savings which prove in the event to beunrealisabie^    It will be necessary to look with special caution atany similar proposals in future.Conclusion10,      I invite the Cabinet to agree that -(a) Clause 2 of the Family Allowances and National insurance bill should be withdrawn, it being explained to the House that discussions would be continuing with both sides of industry about the future pattern ofresponsibility for the support of workers during sickness.(b) Corresponding savings should be found elsewhere in the field ofpublic expenditure to make up for the loss of the savings which would follow from the implementation of Clause 2,R.H.
