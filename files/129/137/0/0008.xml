Apostal vote among Governors of the Fund, which was completed on31st May, produced en overwhelming majority in favour of adopting the necessary amendments to the Fund&apos;s Articles of Agreement to giveeffect to the SDR scheme.     Member countries of the Fund are now being asked whether they accept the proposed amendments.     This process of ratification may take some months.2.       Legislation will be required before the United Kingdom canformally notify the Fund that it accepts the proposed amendments.We intend to obtain the necessary legislation before Parliament risesfor the Summer Recess.    A Bill for this purpose has been drafted and approved by the Legislation Committee for introduction soon after the whitsun adjournment.     Since the Bill refers to the proposed amendmentsit is necessary to lay these before Parliament in a White Paper.3.       The importance of the subject also fully justifies a White paper and I propose that it shculd also include an explanatory text about theSDR scheme,    I invite my colleagues agreement to the draft for thispurpose attached at the Annex.    I should like to publish the White paper on or about 19th June,     The Bill would appear immediately afterwards.Neither the White Paper nor the Bill should be controversial.2a. ft 3h.* JaTreasury Chambers, S.W.1.11th June, .196C
Special Drawing BightsAn Explanatory note the proposal for a system of &quot;Special Drawing Rights&quot; whichhas been adopted &quot;by the Board of Governors of the international monetary Fund and now awaits ratification by the Parliaments of member-countries is a development which should be of great importanceto the orderly expansion of world trade in future years.2,     The technical details are set out in the Appendix, whichreproduces the report by the Executive Directors of the I.M.F.  tothe Board of Governors proposing the requisite amendments to theArticles of Agreement of the I.M.F.    The effect of these amendmentswill be to make it possible for member-countries, under certaincarefully defined conditions, to agree on the deliberate creationof additional liquidity for the world.    The proposed system should thus help to smooth out disturbances to world economic expansionwhich could otherwise follow from a lack of adequate reserves.3,     This is an innovation of the greatest importance.    The actualscheme is the outcome of many years of negotiation, and necessarilyembodies compromises.    To begin with, no doubt, the role of S.D.R.Sin the international monetary system will be a modest one.    But thescheme is the most significant new departure in international monetary affairs since the signing of the original Articles of Agreementof the I.M.F. at Bretton Woods in It embodies a new principle and offers the hope of progress to a more rationally managed worldmonetary system in years to come.Reasons for Action Nowh.    The need for new action in the field of international liquiditybegan to emerge when the forces which brought about a growth ofI world reserves in the last two decades were seen to be weakening.; 5*    At the end of the war, a very high proportion of the world&apos;sSold had accumulated in the reserves of the United States.    The lack: of liquidity in the hands of other countries could have been aconsiderable impediment to the growth of world trade, since everynation must have adequate reserves to finance the inevitable swingsI m its balance of payments.    This danger was avoided for a long period because from about 1950 onwards - shortly after the devaluationgainst the dollar of many of the world&apos;s currencies - the UnitedStates moved into a period of persistent deficit in its balance ofPayments, largely due to heavy outflows of dollars for defence, aid,investment.    This allowed other countries to build up reservesa the form of dollars and gold paid out to finance the deficit.hus the*&apos;e was not only a gradual redistribution of reserves, butDraft White Paper on Special Drawing Rights  .in the International Monetary Fund -i 7 q^ 1, j y
also a steady increase, because of the swelling dollar balances.\t the same time the I.M.F. came to play an important role through its drawing rights, and the quotas of its members were twiceincreased (in 1959 and 1961)).6/   The expansion of world trade and output in the post-war periodlias surpassed anything which has been known in any previous periodof history.    There is little doubt that the satisfactory functioning of the monetary system during this period accounts,  in part, forthis success,    Fler Majesty&apos;s Government believes that a gradual and sustained growth of international liquidity is the beat means of ensuring rising prosperity for the world as a whole.    This gradualexpansion has been achieved over the past two decafies somewhatfortuitously.    For some time now,  the authorities of the leadingcountries in international monetary matters hsve been considering what might be done to ensure a continuing expansion of liquidity instable conditions in future.7,     The. volume of dollar holdings outside the United States has now become very large and clearly new liquidity cannot come from this source indefinitely.    The United States&apos; Government has recognisedthis in its efforts to correct its balance of payments deficit.    nor can the world look to newly mined gold for the necessary additions to reserves.    It is sometimes suggested that the problem could be solved by increasing the price of gold, but Her Majesty&apos;s Government,in common with most other governments, believes that this would do more harm than good, and would mark a retreat from the concept ofrational management of the world monetary system.8.    What is needed, then, is a rational means of making controlledEditions to the world&apos;s stock of reserves on the basis of a collective judgment of the world&apos;s needs at any particular pointin time.   This is the purpose of the scheme for Special DrawingRights.   The amendments to the Articles of the I.M.P. which are proposed will not bring Special Drawing Rights into being, but willembody the scheme in the Articles and so give the I.M.F., byprocedures to be laid down in the amended Articles,  the power tocreate them when the need arises,jhe Nature of the new Assets19.    Special Drawing Rights (S.D.R. s) will be quite different fromthe existing drawing rights in the I.M.F.    Under the existing facilities, member countries may, on certain conditions, maketemporary drawings of currencies of other countries from the poolneld by the Fund and made up principally of members&apos; subscriptions.In contrast, S.D.R. s will be created and distributed by the I.M.F.without any deposit of gold or currencies in a central pool.    They&quot;ill he managed in a separate account.    When a participant in the3,I).R. scheme uses his S.D.R.S he will do so by transferring them,
I,, the books of the Fund, to another participant who will be obliged to sup; ly convertible currency in exchange.    Despite theirt;l;l-, therefore,  the Special Drawing Rights will have  thecharacter of transferable assets.    They will be ;, clear additionto the world&apos;s liquidity and their value to countries which holdt/ie-; will depend wholly on the obligations, which all members willissume, to accept them in exchange for currency.    In this sense thenew assets will he much more like the gold and foreign exchange atcredent held in the Exchangs Equalisation Account than the existingdrawing rights in the I.M.F.i0.   The use of S.D.R.S will naturally be subject to carefullyfined conditions.    The provisions governing their use are setjut in the draft Article XXV,  &quot;Transactions in Special DrawingRights.&quot;   The principal restrictions on the use of S.D.R.S will be: -(a) Section 3(a) of Article XXV lays down that,  except as provided otherwise,  a participant will be expected to use its3.D.R.S only to meet a balance of payments or reserve needand not merely for the purpose of changing the composition ofits reserves.    However, it is for the member country itself,in the first instance,  to judge whether this condition isfulfilled.    Section 3(h) says that the use of S.D.R.3 will not he subject to challenge, although the Fund may make representations to and may ultimately suspend a particijjantwhich fails to fulfil the expectation in Section 3(a).(b) Members who make heavy use of their S.D.R.S will be obligedlater to &quot;reconstitute&quot; their holdings of S.D.R.S to someextent.    For the first five-year period during which the schemeis in operation,  the rule will be that the average of a country&apos;s total daily holdings of S.D.R.S must not be less than30.&apos; of its allocation.    Thus, for example,  a country which had used all its S.D.R.s in the first two years of the period wouldthen have to reconstitute its holdings by buying enough S.D.R.from other members with currency to arrive at an average holdingover the whole period above the 30% limit.    After the first five year period the reconstitution provisions will be reviewed.    Reconstitution will not mean a loss of reserves forany country but only a change in their form.    The arrangement will have the effect of keeping the ownership of this new andunfamiliar asset reasonably well spread over the membership ofthe scheme.    The provisions governing reconstitution are inSection 6 of Article XXV and Schedule G.Participants in the scheme will not have absolute freedom to decide whether or not to accept S.D.R.S from other members.Section 5 of Article XXV provides for the Fund to designateParticipants to accept S.D.R. s and provide currency in exchange.
It specifies two principles which will govern the selection of countries for designation, namely that they should becountries with strong balance of payments and reserve positionsor countries who need to acquire S.D.R.S to meet obligations under the scheme, particularly the obligation to reconstitutetheir holdings.(d)    A limit is set to trie amount of 3.D.R.S which a countryis obliged to accept, providing currency in exchange.    ArticleXXV Section U says,  in effect,  that no country need hold 3.D.R.Sbeyond three times its allocation.    But it may do so voluntarily.1.   The value of 5.D.R.s will be defined in terms of a weight of-old and it will therefore remain constant in terms of gold despiteuhanges in currency values (Article XXI,  Section 2).    S.D.R.S willbe allocated to all participants in the scheme (participation is open to all members of the I.M.F.) in amounts determined aspercentages of quotas in the I.M.F.  (Article XXIV,  Section 2(b)).Decisions to allocate S.D.R..S will be made for five-year basicperiods and each participant would receive an annual allocationwithin this period.12.   Article XXVI contains provisions for interest and charges tobe received from or paid to the Fund.    Participating countries willcay charges or receive interest in S.D.R.S depending on whether ithas on balance used or acquired them.13.   Procedures are laid down in the draft Articles for bringing the scheme into force (Article XXIV,  Section U).    A proposal wouldbe made by the Managing Director to the Board of Governors.    the managing Director is obliged first to satisfy himself that theprinciples (laid down in Article XXIV, Section 1 ) governing theallocation of S.D.R.S have been met,  and to conduct consultations\ 10 enable him to ascertain that there is broad support amongI participants for the proposal.    It must also be concurred in by thej Executive Directors.    It then requires a majority of 85% of thetotal voting power for approval by the Board of Governors.Procedures are also laid down for the cancellation of S.D.R.S,  the suspension of transactions in S.D.R.S,  the termination of participatiDn0i&apos; a member and for liquidation of the scheme (Articles XXIV, XXIX,?-XX and XXXI).I^icipation by the United KingdomThe Chancellor of the Exchequer,  as the United KingdomGovernor of the I.M.F., has voted in favour of the resolution whichIfl&apos;0Pms Annex A of the Executive Directors&apos; report and that resolution has now been adopted.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government propose151 when the amendments to the Articles have come into force,  the
United Kingdom should become a participant in the Special DrawingAccount by depositing the instrument referred to in Article XXIII,Section 1, with the Fund.    This  instrument would state that theUnited Kingdom undertakes all the obligations of a participant andthat all the necessary steps to enable the United Kingdom to carryout these obligations have been taken.    her Majesty&apos;s government propose to introduce legislation for this purpose.    It is theGovernment&apos;s intention that S.D.R. s owned by the United kingdom should be treated, as part of its reserves in the same way as gold and convertible currencies.    The proposed legislation would thereforepermit Special Drawing Rights to be taken into the Exchangejualisation Account and all transactions in S.D.R.S in accordancewith the scheme to be undertaken through the E.E.A.Other changes in the I.M.F.15,   The report of the Executive Directors also describes certain other proposals for amending the Articles of Agreement of the I.M.F.These Articles have nut been amended since they were agreed atBretton Woods in 19UU.    The most important changes concern themajorities required for certain decisions by the I.M.F.    Theseproposals also have the support of Her Majesty&apos;s Government.
