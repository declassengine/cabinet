H H?j^H this Document is the property of hfr britannic majesty&apos;s government^^Bsecret? dl ?/ ?C.(54) 261 COPY NO. &apos;I 28th July, 1954CABINETANTARCTICABB^Ba ^emoran(^um by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs PJ111BB^bI and the Secretary of State for the ColoniesThe Cabinet decided on 25th August, 1953, that confidential sounding^^HBBh   I should be made in Argentina and Chile to see whether those Governmentswould be prepared to enter into discussions about outstanding claims in PJ^HAntarctica, whether they would be prepared to take the initiative inproposing such discussions and what proposals they would be likely to putforward (C. C. (53) 50th Conclusions, Minute 5).    An approach on these PJ^HPJ^H                    lines was duly made to the Argentine Government who, after muchprocrastination, made it clear that they were not interested in discussing /^^Ha settlement.    (We did not approach the Chilean Government, whoseoffences are   less flagrant and whose basic interest is to deny Argentinaa monopoly of the spoils, since we were waiting to see if the i-rgentinereply was favourable.) PJ^H2. This rejection of our soundings, coupled with the increasing weightP_PJH                    of the Argentine challenge, has made the Antarctic problem more pressingthan ever.    In a recent speech President Perdn said that he would&quot;saturate&quot; our Antarctic territories.    If we are not to lose further groundPJIH when the new Antarctic season opens in November, we must start planning PaPJHPJ our dispositions now.BB^bI ^rRen^ne and Chilean activities PaPJI3. V/e are already outclassed by Argentina in the Antarctic.    We LP-PaPJP_PJH                    have only one obsolescent vessel (the Royal Research Ship John Biscoe)PJ available to relieve our bases, and one frigate: the Argentines used sevennaval vessels last season.    We have no aircraft in the region: ArgentinaPgPJH had six &quot;conventional&quot; aircraft last season and three helicopters, andPJ Chile one seaplane and one helicopter.    The Argentines have eight morelarge helicopters on order from the United States, and have bought some PbPbPJJP-P-PJJ large flying-boats there too.    They have ordered an ice-breaker fromPJ Germany.P_PJH Fuller details of the Argentine and Chilean challenge are setI out at Annex A. PaPJHPaPJH Possible counter measures4. In his minute to the Prime Minister of 18th August, 1953,I (circulated to the Cabinet as C. (53) 241) the Lord President of the Council P#^Hindicated three possible courses of action: to maintain (and support) ourtitle to our whole sector; to reduce our commitment; or to go on as we-i-
are.    None of these courses is feasible to-day.    To eject the ArgentinesI would mean a scale of effort and expenditure out of all proportion to ourBAVJ resources and cause a crisis in Anglo-Argentine relations.    To take theBldi/i^       initiative in proposing a cession of territory to Argentina would mean^^|| admitting the weakness of our claim, and the most we could expect would KwAVI be to retain only a fragment of our present sector.    It would also under-mine the &quot;sector principle&quot; upon which the claims of Australia, New Zealand,France and Norway likewise depend.    To go on as we are would merelyencourage the Argentines to continue their encroachments until they force^-M us out completely: thereafter they would probably launch a heightenedcampaign against the Falkland Islands themselves.Expansion of Antarctic activity5. Hitherto our policy has been to disperse our activities as widelyas possible over the Dependencies in an attempt to maintain our claim tothe whole area.    It is now evident that this policy cannot be effective, andI we are advised that it would be better to concentrate on making our titleBAVJ to selected areas secure.    We therefore propose that we should increaseour activity over the next four or five years with the object of discoveringquickly which parts of the Dependencies would be most worth retainingI in the event of partition.    We also think it essential to strengthen ourPaVJ position so that we do not enter upon any eventual settlement handicappedby our present weakness.    Such a policy of increased activity should helpto put the Argentine and Chilean Governments into a mood to reach aI settlement and it would also give us some answer to the charge that weare losing Antarctica through inertia and parsimony. BAyJ6. Our present level of activity is supported by an annual grant ofup to  100,000 from Her Majesty&apos;s Government.    The balance 6f the costis met from the revenues of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Administra- BAvJtion.    Since this United Kingdom grant started in 1951-2, the cost ofequipping and staffing our activities has gone up; and  45,000 annually isbeing put into the sinking fund for replacing the supply ship.    (The hull KVaVof the R.R.S. John Biscoe has developed dry rot, and she has under twoyears&apos; more active life).    Our present activities, therefore, are less thanthe available resources were expected to provide for.    We accordingly PAVJrecommend the following steps:-(i)   The purchase or construction of a new supply ship, &quot;designedI for use in Polar waters, and of a smaller support ship -VaVJ this capital cost to be met by a special grant from KyAVHer Majesty&apos;s Government.    A new main vessel wouldcost about  450,000 (less any sum realised on theI break-up of the old ship and the amount in the presentVaVJ sinking fund).    The smaller ship could be boughtsecond-hand for about  100,000.I (ii)   Such a grant would release funds for the increase inPaVJ current activities, and we should recommend the openingof two new bases (one at Anvers Island for explorationfor copper deposits, and probably the re-opening of the? old base at Marguerite Bay).    It might be possible toPAVJ open further bases in a year or two&apos;s time, and the ^^^Jquestion would then have to be examined whether thiswould require any increase in Her Majesty&apos;s Govern^I ment&apos;s annual grant.
7. We regard the above as the minimum steps necessary to ^^^Hrestore the level of activity, and give us at least eight bases instead ofthe present six.    Taking a longer view, it would be extremely valuable???l  ? iA if we could undertake an aerial survey of the Dependencies.    Before _^^Hwe can decide with confidence on a long-term policy for the Antarctic we ^^^Hneed a much clearer idea of the potentialities of our sector, and we are ^^^Hadvised that the best contribution to this would be to obtain maps by an P_^Hair survey, with a view to subsequent detailed exploration of selectedI areas.    Such a survey would have to be done through an air charterPAVJ company, and the cost of a complete survey is estimated at about 300,000 spread over three years. ^^^fl8. An important project which has been put forward is for a ^^^Hjourney across the Antarctic continent via the South Pole, linking theP_V_]                    United Kingdom Dependencies with the Australian and New Zealand ^^^h_V_VJ                    Antarctic, to start in a year&apos;s time.    Neither this exploration, nor _V_Haerial surveying would, we are advised, do much by themselves to RVAVJH              improve our legal position, which is governed chiefly by the extent of ^^^HPAVJ                    settlement on the ground.    But we are impressed with the scientific ^^^B1value and political and prestige advantages of such a new Antarcticjourney.    We should hope to obtain the support and participation of theAustralian, New Zealand and South African Governments, and the project KV_Hwould thus provide a valuable demonstration of Commonwealth solidarity RV-Hin the Antarctic.    The estimated cost of the journey is  200,000,part ofwhich would have to be provided by Her Majesty&apos;s Government. In ^^^Jaddition considerable support will probably be required from the Services,PAVJ                    but this has not yet been fully examined either from the practical or ^^^hfinancial point of view.9. Details of the projects summarised in paragraphs 6 to 8 aboveare given in Annex B. P_V_fl???1 Strengthening our legal title10. These activities would strengthen our physical and hence our PAJAVpolitical position.    Our judicial position also needs safeguarding and itH would help to do this if Her Majesty&apos;s Government were to make a uni- _VAVJP_V_] lateral application to the International Court of Justice, stating their casefor sovereignty over the Falkland Islands Dependencies, and complainingof the Argentine and Chilean encroachments and violations of BritishH sovereignty.    Such a move would not oblige the Argentine and ChileanP_V_] Governments to accept the jurisdiction of the Court and to litigate thedispute, but it would strengthen our position and would be of assistanceshould the Antarctic dispute be brought before the Court at some futureI date with the consent of these Governments.    It would also tend tomMM frustrate the present Argentine and Chilean policy of building up a legalcase by constant encroachments on our position.    In disputes aboutterritorial sovereignty there is always a so-called &quot;critical date&quot;, afterI which the actions of the disputing parties do not count towards theP_^| establishment of their case - for instance anything they do after the datewhen the dispute goes to the Court.    But the date is often fixed muchearlier than that, and, if this dispute ever came before the Court, it would???l    W\ be in our interest that the &quot;critical date&quot; should be fixed as early asI possible.    We are advised that, if Her Majesty&apos;s Government were tomake a unilateral application to the Court this year, this should ensurethat the &quot;critical date&quot; in the Antarctic dispute would be fixed not later ft^Hthan 1954, and we would hope it might be fixed a good deal earlier.-3-
I I11. This step would not absolve us from the necessity of making WMm^LWM                 our occupation of the Falkland Islands Dependencies an effectiveoccupation.    The Antarctic dispute may never reach the InternationalCourt, and we cannot allow our de facto position to deteriorate anyKVfl further.    Moreover, if the dispute did reach the Court, the fact that we KVflhad neglected our physical position would create prejudice against us.It would therefore be a mistake to think that, if we make a unilateralapplication to the Court, the expanded programme outlined above wouldbecome unnecessary. VaVJ12. It would be well to inform the Argentine and ChileanGovernments beforehand of our intentions regarding the InternationalCourt, since a warning might have a deterrent effect.    We would saythat Her Majesty&apos;s Government have been prepared since 1947 to submitthe Antarctic dispute to the International Court, although the otherGovernments concerned have not seen fit to accept this offer, that theycannot delay further and that they are now proposing to put in train anapplication to the Court stating their case.    We would at the same timesay that we would not proceed with this course if the two Governmentswere prepared to accept an arbitration of the dispute by independentarbitrators.    (It is unlikely that either of them would be any lessreluctant to submit the dispute to a panel of arbitrators than to theInternational Court, but we see advantage in making this offer, which wehave never formally put to them before, and which is not open to theobvious political objections of an offer to enter into partition negotiations).Treasury views13. The Treasury have been consulted at official level and haveexpressed considerable doubt whether the cost of increased activity inAntarctica can be justified on the grounds given, in view of the many KVflpressing claims elsewhere and the extensive efforts to reduce overseasexpenditure generally.    They support the proposed reference to theInternational Court to fix a &quot;critical date&quot; but they maintain that, inspite of the arguments used in paragraphs 5 and 11 above,   this in itselfwould to some extent lessen the need for increased activity.    They pointout the difficulty of seeing where competition of this sort will lead and thepossibility that it will increase the chance of local clashes which mayinvolve Service help.    They agree that it will be necessary to provideadditional funds in the next two years for replacement of the supply ship,which has unexpectedly deteriorated, but they are uneasy about the lackof knowledge of the precise cost of the other measures suggested.Conclusions14. We seek our colleagues&apos; agreement to the following:-ftVfl (i) increased United Kingdom activity in the Antracticshould be approved in principle;(ii) if this is agreed, then:-(a) Her Majesty&apos;s Government should make a grantof up to approximately  550,000 to cover the capitalcost of building or buying a new ship and a smallersupport vessel: BfWJmmm -4-
? F i ?(b) support by Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentfor the trans-Polar journey, in the form of a KrAIJcash contribution, should be approved inprinciple - the First Lord of the Admiralty andthe Secretary of State for Air being asked toconsider and report whether, and to whatextent, they could support the journey:(c) the advantages of surveying our territoryfrom the air should be further considered onftVAVJ the score of cost:(iii) notes should be addressed to the Argentine andIChile an Governments informing them thatwe propose to apply to the International Courtof Justice, unless they are prepared to submitthe Antarctic dispute to arbitration;(iv) interested Commonwealth Governments should beinformed of the proposed action and giventhe opportunity to comment if they so wish.28th July, 1954.I I &quot;5~ WW

ANN5X BINCREASED ACTIVITY IN THE FALKLAND ISLANDS DEPENDENCIESUnited Kingdom activities in the Falkland Islands Dependencies _^^Hare carried on by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey which isresponsible to the Secretary of State for the Colonies through the Governorof the Falkland Islands.    The Survey performs valuable scientific work, (?HHbut, as indicated in the body of this paper, its activities are dwarfed by thoseof the Argentine Antarctic forces.    The following paragraphs set out anumber of suggestions for expanding the work of the Survey and generallyincreasing the degree of interest shown by the United Kingdom in theAntarctic.H^H The need for two new ships2. The Survey depends on the Royal Research Ship John Biscoefor the supply and relief of its six bases.    This vessel has only one or twomore years of active life and is too fully occupied to be used for anyinvestigation of the territories.    The Survey are having to put by relativelylarge sums from their annual resources to provide for a replacement vessel,and the need to provide for this sinking fund restricts the number of baseswhich the Survey can afford to maintain.    Between 1944 and 1947 the Surveyemployed three vessels to maintain five bases.    If the Survey are to be ableto maintain their existing bases, add new ones and undertake coastal surveys,it is essential that an early start should be made on (i) the construction ofan up-to-date replacement for the John Biscoe, and (ii) the building or ^^^hpurchase of a companion vessel.    If these two ships could T&gt;e paid for by aspecial grant from Her Majesty&apos;s Government, additional to the presentannual  100,000 grant made by the Government towards the Survey, tlie workof the Survey would be very greatly facilitated.?HHIi fc*creased number of Bases3&quot; Unauthorised foreign bases have increased notably in recentyears while our own have been decreased from a maximum of eight in 1948.To facilitate a programme of increased activity and emphasise United KingdomI        sovereignty, we need an increase in the number of bases of the Survey.It should be possible to forestall the Argentines and slow down their rate of ^^^Hexpansion by setting up new British bases at two.of the three known sites thatcan be used for landing aircraft.    The cost of setting up a new base is in theregion of  15,000s the cost of maintaining one is from  5,000 to  7,000I        annually according to its size.Air Survey of the Dependencies4. The Scientific Committee of the Survey have long consideredI        that a survey by means of aerial phtography of the Dependencies would be theonly economical method of covering such a large area within a reasonable J&apos;^^^HA time. Such topographical surveys of the Dependencies as have been carried j^^^lout so far have necessarily been restricted to a few of the islands and ps,ri ^^^Hof the coastal fringe of Graham Land. The cost of employing an air charter 1company for the purpose was estimated in 1952 as in the region of  300,000. j^^^lThis is a substantial sum - three times the present annual United Kingdom ^^^Hcontribution to the work of the Survey - but we would urge that consideration j^^^lbe given to making funds available for this project. Circumstances now force: ^^^Hupon us the necessity to carry out in three or four years the long-term ground! ^^^flWWm H II
Iff ?I        survey programme which would otherwise have been spread over about ^^^Htwenty years.    There is no alternative open to us if adequate maps are to ^^^Hbe available in time.    The Argentines and Chileans have both already ^^^H\ \({m    embarked on air surveys of this British territory.5, There is a possibility that if the project for a trans-Polar ^^^Hjourney can be arranged (see paragraph 7 below) and if R.A.F. support is ^^^flI        made available for the expedition, the aircraft involved might also carryI        out some photography which could be used for survey purposes.    It wouldbe better, however, if we could go aheadstraightaway with plans for an air ^^^Hsurvey by private charter company rather than wait for assistance from the ^^^HRoA.F,: such assistance may not be available, and it is doubtful whether, in ^^^HI        any case, with their other commitments the R A#F  detachment involved ^^^Hcould cover more than a small part of the unmapped area, ^^^BInvestigation of Mineral Potentialities6, There is no systematic information about mineral potentialities ^^^flI in the British sector of the Antarctic. Various expeditions have yielded H^^HI         indications that there may be deposits of coal, oil, copper and possibly other ^^^Hminerals; there is no reason to believe that radio-active minerals exist in ^^^Hthe Antarctic either in higher or in lower quantities than they do elsewhere ^^^Hin the earth&apos;s crust. But Antarctica is so inhospitable, and is covered with ^^^Hso thick an ice cap, that it seems doubtful whether any mineral discovery, ^^^Hexcept one of a mineral of relatively high value in relation to its bulk, ^^^HI existing at a point where there is relatively free access from the sea, could ^^^Hever be commercially exploitable.    The one deposit of this character of ^^^flwhich there are indications is a suspected deposit of copper carbonate ores ^^^Hat Anvers Island in the Palmer Archipelago off the west coast of GrahamLand (see the large map attached as Appendix II).    This island has not so ^^^hI far been systematically explored, but in the course of the last Antarctic season ^^^HI the Survey put a small party ashore to try to collect ore samples.    As the ^^^Hresources of the Survey have not allowed for the equipment of a full-scale ^^^flsurvey party, a Colonial Development and Welfare grant is now being con- ^^^Hsidered, to defray the cost of recruiting and maintaining a full survey party,which it is hoped will start its work next season.    The purpose will be to .I survey the island and to prospect the point known as Copper Peak, toascertain whether an important deposit of copper ore does in fact exist, ^^^BThe one sample which is at present available seems to indicate an ore ofrich content, but an investigation on the spot by fully qualified geologistsI is required.    It is clearly important that this work should be proceeded withnot only for its own sake, but because of the risk of our being forestalled by ^^^flan Argentine party.    The proposed air survey would be accompanied and ^^^Hfollowed by ground geological surveys of the most promising areas selectedfrom the air photographs.    By this means the work of mineral prospectingI can be greatly speeded.^Lmm Proposal for a Trans-Polar Journey7, Apart from the regular scientific work of the Falkland IslandsI          Dependencies Survey, there has been no British expedition for explorationin our sector, to carry on the great traditions of Scott and Shackle ton since ^^^fltil the British Graham Land Expedition of 1934-37.    It has been thought for some^Htime, in scientific circles, that there would be a substantial scientific value ^^^hin a new sledge journey crossing the Polar ice cap from the British coastin the Falkland Islands Dependencies to the New Zealand coast on the RossSea,    Plans for such a journey to take place in the 1955-56 season have been |^^^|drawn up by Dr. V.E, Fuchs, the Director of the Survey&apos;s Scientific Bureau j^^^hin London.    He has made these plans in a private capacity, but they havebeen submitted to, and approved, from a scientific angle, by the Royal ^^^JGeographical Society and by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Scientific ^^^H-8-
Committee, and also recommended for further study by the Polar Committee, ^^^flan inter-Commonwealth Committee which meets in London underCommonwealth Relations Office chairmanship0    It is estimated to cost about^Bl        200,000, exclusive of any support which the Services could give. Theorganisers expect that a substantial part of the cost could be raised fromprivate sources, but that an assurance would be required of some financialand other support from Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdomand from other Commonwealth Governments.    When the Polar Committeeconsidered the matter it was recommended that the project should be ^^^hreported to United .Kingdom Ministers and, once their views were madeknown, to the Commonwealth Governments concerned, to ascertain whetherGovernmental support could be given to it.    An unofficial working comiTiitteeunder the chairmanship of Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir John Slessorhas been formed and we understand that informal enquiries have alreadybeen made by Sir John Slessor about the possibility of support being furnishedby the R. A. F. if the project is approved.8a We are assured that this journey, if successfully undertaken*,would have scientific value.    It would also have political value, in that it ^^^hwould link up the British with the Australian and New Zealand sectors| andshould give evidence to the world of Commonwealth in&apos;ierests in the Antarctic.It would, we are advised, have little value towards strengthening our claimto sovereignty; but it would, especially if it could be supported by Service ^^^hequipment and personnel, demonstrate to the world our leadership in the t.rea, ^^^h?H 1 -!1 ^1I1H    l &quot;9- :
