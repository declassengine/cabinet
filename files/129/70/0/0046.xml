Ok.DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER   BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1954SECRET Copy No.    7 4C. (54) 29624th September, 1954CABINETOVERSEAS INFORMATION SERVICES: THE DROGHEDA report memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs it has become urgent for the Cabinet to take a decision on the DroghedaReport; otherwise we shall find ourselves in an awkward position when parliament reassembles. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have now had the Report for over a yearand we cannot go on repeating that we are giving the Report careful considerationbut have not yet reached any decision. Furthermore the Departments will requireto know soon where they stand in order to prepare their estimates for next year.2. The Drogheda Committee reported in July 1953 and a White Paper(Cmd. 9138) summarising the Report and its recommendations was laid beforeParliament in April 1954. This was generally well received both in parliament and by the press. On 1st June, the Home Secretary, as chairman of a Committeeof Ministers charged by the Cabinet with the study of the Report, circulated his recommendations (C. (54) 185). On 8th July, the Commonwealth Secretary, as chairman of the Committee on Civil Expenditure, submitted counter-proposals(C. (54) 228). No decision has yet been taken on these two papers.3 On earlier occasions when this matter has been discussed I have expressedthe view that strong. and efficient overseas information services are essential forthe successful conduct of foreign policy. I adhere to this view; indeed, in mybelief, recent events in Europe and in the Middle East and South-East Asia haveincreased the need to expand our information services.4. After an exhaustive survey which lasted nine months, the drogheda committee recommended an increase in expenditure on the overseas information services of some  2-5 millions to be spread over 3-5 years whereas theCommonwealth Secretary in C. (54) 228 recommends that expenditure should be cut. The Home Secretary sought to find a middle way between the view of the overseas Departments that it is essential to carry out the Droghedarecommendations forthwith and the view of the Treasury that financial limitationspreclude this.5. I strongly recommend to my colleagues acceptance of the Home Secretary&apos;recommendation. It would allow Her Majesty&apos;s Government to declare, when parliament reassembles, that it is their policy to accept in principle the financialand other recommendations of the Drogheda Report; at the same time, byspreading the cost over seven years, it would reduce the financial burden to reasonable proportions. On this basis no more than an additional  357,000 wouldbe needed for expansions in the next financial year, and in each of the subsequent years during the 7-year period. Given the magnitude of the task of conductingour affairs overseas, I cannot feel that this is an unreasonable request to make atthe present time.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,23rd September, 1954.46853
