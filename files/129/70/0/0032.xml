(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.(54) 282 COPY NO. U\7th. September, 1954CABINETDEVELOPMENT OF GATWICK airport memorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation at the meeting on 20th July, after considering my predecessorsmemorandum (C. (54) 236), the Cabinet &quot;agreed that the report of the inquiry into the proposed extension of Gatwick Airport should be considered at an early meeting during the Recess so that the Government^ decision might be announced in the course of September&quot;.2. Since I took over the Ministry of Transport and Civil aviation have been exhaustively into the whole issue.    I have also visited andflown over Gatwick.3. In the result, contrary to the view I held before going into thematter, I find myself in full agreement with my predecessor that we should proceed without delay with the Gatwick project.4. I desire to add only the following comments to what the presentColonial Secretary has submitted in previous papers and which I willnot recapitulate.5. There are two points in issue:-(a) Is an alternate airport required?(b) If it is, should it be Gatwick?6. On (a) it is only too clear that by 1958 at the latest traffic at London Airport will in bad weather and also in peak periods be in excessof what can be handled there.    The problem is made the worse by the prospective advent of jet aircraft which cannot be &quot;stacked&quot; for very long.I attach as appendix to this memorandum a table showing the growth intraffic so far.    There seems to be every likelihood that this tendency willcontinue.7. It is unnecessary to emphasise the loss from both the economicand prestige point of view which would result from London&apos;s Airports beinginadequate.8. From the point of view of cost, if we provide a suitablealternate we can cut down the excessively large number of Airports now in use round London.    This will give us a substantial offset in reducedoperating expenses and in what we receive from the sale of Croydon.-1-
9. (b) then arises.    Gatwick is not of course ideal.    I know of noideal site.    But all round it is better than any of the very large number ofother sites which have been examined.    I do not wish to trouble mycolleagues with technical detail.    But the control of air traffic in the areaover Southern England is becoming increasingly complex and the necessity to site this airport as far as possible away from sources of danger whilesiting it in a convenient position both for the airways and for ground accessdoes impose serious limitations on one&apos;s choice.    On balance, I am satisfied that Gatwick is the best choice.10. There is a difficult question on compensation.    In 1947 theSocialist Government gave an assurance that Gatwick would not be developed.    Sir Colin Campbell, in paragraph 276 of his Report, says:-&quot;This change of mind will, if the extension(of the airport) proceeds, cause unusual hardship onindividuals who purchased properties at a time whenthe intention to make Gatwick a major airport hadbeen specifically rejected and the value of whoseinterests will be seriously depreciated&quot;.In view of this, I think it would be very difficult not to make some provisionfor compensation.    I have worked out a scheme which would not cost muchand would be confined to people who bought or developed property between1947 and 1952.    But I understand that objection may be raised by other ministers to my proposals;  and these will need to be examined further anda decision reached before any public statement is made.11. The mis-handling of this matter by the late Government, and theunderstandable local feeling against the proposal, make this a far from easymatter.    But as above indicated, I am satisfied that we should not be dis-charging our responsibility to civil aviation if we were to do other than go ahead with this project.    There is a good deal of urgency in point of time,since if Gatwick is to be operational before London Airport becomesinadequate to handle all the traffic, preliminary arrangements must startwithout delay.    The handling of the announcement will clearly require careful thought, and it would be helpful if I could have the assistance of oneor two of my colleagues.12. I therefore ask  -(1) that the Cabinet approve implementation of the Gatwick scheme;(2) that the form and timing of the announce -ment be referred to a small ministerial committee.J.A.B-C.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation,6th September, 1954.
