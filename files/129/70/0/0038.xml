HaSECRETC.(54) 288 COPY NOv13th September, 1954CABINETSTATIONING OF BRITISH FORCES IN JORDANMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Cabinet agreed on 21st January last (C.C.(54) 4th Conclusions,Minute 5) that we should accept the Jordan Government^ invitation tosend an armoured squadron to South Jordan, but should tell the Jordaniansthat we could not build it up to an armoured regiment, as they had suggested, unless the regiment could be stationed in the North.2. On 7th July the Jordan Government told us that they would likeour troops in South Jordan to be brought up to brigade strength as soonas possible.    They would also like to see our forces moved further North,but needed time to prepare local opinion.3. I consider it important to accept the invitation to increase our forces in Jordan, both as a deterrent to hostilities and because it willenable us to get a foot in the door for our own redeployment purposes.While it would be better for strategic and climatic reasons to send our forces to North Jordan, I am satisfied that this is not politically feasibleat the moment.4. I have discussed the matter with the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister of Defence, and we now propose that theGovernment of Jordan should be told that Her Majesty&apos;s government agree to build up the armoured squadron in South Jordan to an armouredregiment, on condition that satisfactory accommodation arrangements can be worked out, and in the hope that it will be possible before long tomove our troops further North.    We are consulting General Glubb as tothe possibility of the Arab Legion providing adequate temporary accommodation on reasonable terms.5. It is probable that the Israelis will get to know of the move ofthe armoured regiment and that this will have a salutary effect on them,especially if they think that still larger British forces will eventually besent to Jordan.    We did in fact tell the Israelis early in 1953 that we had decided in principle to send an armoured brigade into Jordan, and theyraised no objection.    When the armoured squadron was despatched weinformed the Israelis in advance, assuring them that we had no aggressiveintentions, but reminding them of our obligations under the Anglo-jordan treaty.    I see no reason to make a further communication to the Israelison the present occasion, but propose to explain the move on similar linesif they should ask about it.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.11th September, 1954.
