secret.(54) 260 COPY NO.   7&amp;28th July, 1954-CABINETPERSIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Consortium is nearing agreement with the Persians onthe future operation of the Persian oil industry.    The Anglo-iranian oil Company (A.I.O.C.) will, of course, have a 40 per cent share in the consortium, and the other members will be paying them a sum of 214 millions over twenty years for the remaining 60 per cent share(this figure cannot at present be revealed).2. On compensation for such of A.I,O.C.,s losses as will not be covered by the above, the Persians have offered a net payment of 25 millions after A.I,O.C.&apos;s claims and Persian counter-claims havebeen taken into account.    The Board of A.I.O.C. have not yet considered this offer, but will be influenced by Her Majesty&apos;s Governments view of it.3. A.I.O.C. have asked whether, if they accept this offer or some-thing near it, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would agree that there shouldbe included in the agreement an undertaking by A.I.O.C. to pay to Persiaa sum of just under  50 millions, which Persia would have received if she had ratified the 1949 Agreement with A.I.O.C.    This would be offsetagainst A.I.O.C. &apos;s claims and would not affect the net payment, but A.I.O.C.would thus avoid payment of United Kingdom income tax on this sum,worth approximately  25 millions.4. I ask my colleagues to agree that;(a) Provided the Board of A.I.O.C. agree,H. M. Ambassador in Teheran should be instructed to make a final attempt to getthe Persians to offer a net payment of 30 millions but given discretion to accept 25 millions.(b) Her Majesty&apos;s Government should agree toA.I.O,C.Is proposal in paragraph 3 aboveprovided that:(i) the agreement is expressed in such a way that the total of Persian compensation is described as  75 millions payable over aperiod of years, A.I.O.C. undertaking to pay to Persia the  50 millions over the sameperiod.    This would have the advantage ofmaking the nominal figure of compensationgreater, and it could be made clear that paymentof the Persian claim to  50 millions is dependentupon ratification of the new agreement with the consortium;
(ii) A.I.O.C. obtain the agreement of theirpartners in the Consortium to this procedure(iii) the Persians do not raise serious objection;  and(iv)  if the agreement of all concerned is not obtained within the week, the A.I.O.C. willdrop the idea and accept a straight payment by Persia of  30 millions or  25 millions asthe case may be, without any mention of the1949 Agreement.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.27th July, 1954.
