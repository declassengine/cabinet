(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL.C.(54) 290 COPY NO.    LL16th September, 1954CABINETRETIREMENT OF VICE-ADMIRAL J. HUGHES-HALLSTTMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Treasury have been asked to agree to the payment toVice-Admiral Hughes-Halle tt of retired pay of  1,200 a year, insteadof  873 per annum, the most he is entitled to as a serving officerretiring voluntarily in order to become a Parliamentary candidate.Vice-Admiral Hughes-Hallett was erroneously informed by the NavalSecretary to the First Lord of the Admiralty that he would get the rateappropriate to compulsory retirement, that is  1,200 a year, and theground for the Admiralty&apos;s request is that public faith has been pledged.2.        In cases where, owing to departmental errors, public faith is held to be pledged, Treasury practice is to maintain that it is not enoughmerely to show that a benefit to which a man is not entitled has been promised, but that by reason of that promise he has been induced to take some course of action from which he could not withdraw without loss or damage to himself by the time the error and the true facts were made known to him.3.        The Vice-Admiral was told by the Permanent Secretary of theAdmiralty on 26th August that he had been misinformed.    He was also told in a letter sent to him on 28th August that, if he withdrew from east Croydon, he would be allowed to serve out his time in his presentpost and secure a right to compulsory retirement terms, and that apublic statement could be issued indicating that the reason for his with-drawal was the Admiralty&apos;s desire to retain his services.4.        The question arises whether at this stage he could have with-drawn his candidature without damage.    As a result of circumstancesover which he had no control, his selection by the executive of the localparty had been announced publicly on 24th August.    Vice-AdmiralHughes-Hallett considered that he was morally committed to hiscandidature, and that if he withdrew his reputation would be so damagedthat his acceptability as a candidate for some other constituency later,after his retirement, would be seriously prejudiced.    He could not, ofcourse, claim as part of the damage the loss of the nomination at East Croydon, since his case is that he would not have gone forward ifhe had been correctly informed from the beginning.    The damage to hisfuture political prospects arising from his withdrawal would be difficultto assess, but it would, of course, be at least as difficult for theAdmiralty to maintain that no damage of this kind would have resulted.
5.        Vice-Admiral Hughes-Hallett has, however, decided againstwithdrawing and the Treasury Solicitor, whose opinion has been soughtas to whether he could bring an action against the Admiralty on the groundthat he was led to take what he regards as an irrevocable step while underthe erroneous impression that his pension would be  1,200 instead of 873, has advised that he would be able, not only to put together a caseon these grounds, but would probably succeed in satisfying the Courtsthat he had suffered damage.6.        Vice-Admiral Hughes-Hallett will be fortunate in getting a parliamentary seat in East Croydon and the higher pension of 1,200 a year, but there is, I think, really no alternative to the coursesuggested by the Admiralty, that is to say, to make an extra-statutoryaward of a Rear-Admiral&apos;s standard rate of retired pay of 1,200 a year.    This as an extra-statutory award would have to benoted in the Admiralty Appropriation Account for the current year.7.        It must be recognised that the circumstances of this case are such that attempts may be made to use it to embarrass the Government.Although, viewed objectively, the argument that Vice-AdmiralHughes-Halletfs future political career if he withdrew might have been damaged is a reasonable one, interested parties may claim that it wasno part of the Governments duty to safeguard the political future of party political candidates of the same colour or to pay him compensationfor possible damage at public expense.    Whilst such a presentationwould, on the facts of the case, be a gross distortion, there may be many prepared to make allegations of this kind and others who willbelieve them.8.        Whilst, therefore, I am prepared reluctantly to agree to theAdmiralty&apos;s proposal, I felt that I should bring the case to the attentionof my colleagues as one which could be a source of possible futureembarrassment.    My own recommendation is that we should accept this risk, and be prepared to defend the decision on its merits, quotingalso the legal advice that the Admiral&apos;s claim to have been damagedwould in all probability have been upheld by the Courts.9.        The First Lord of the Admiralty desires to be associated with me in this paper.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.14th September, 1954.
