Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1954SECRET Copy No. 7 3C. (54) 26229th July, 1954CABINETTHE NATIONAL FOOD SURVEYMemorandum by the Minister of Food and the Minister of health in accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on 17th February (C.C. (54)9th Conclusions, Minute 10), we invited the Standing Committee on Medical andNutritional Problems under the Chairmanship of the Chief Medical Officer of theMinistry of Health to comment, in the light of trends revealed by the NationalFood Survey and any other information available, on the nutritional position ofthe larger families, and, in particular, on the following specific questions:  (a) Do the data from 3,000 families per quarter constitute an adequate basis for Government action in a matter of this kind?(b) Are family allowances proving inadequate or are they being spent onobjects of a kind for which they are not intended?(c) Doec the decreased consumption of calcium and protein in the largerfamilies reflect under-nourishment of children or of parents?2. At the meeting of the Committee that discussed this question the following were represented: the Ministries of Health, Food, Education, Labour and NationalService, and Pensions and National Insurance, and the Medical Research Council.3. The Committee&apos;s comments are set out in Appendix A to this paper. Itwill be seen from paragraph 7 of this Appendix that the Committee consider thatthe indication given in the National Food Survey by the downward trend in theconsumption of foods rich in calcium and protein should be heeded, and that itwould be desirable and appropriate to take measures to reverse the trend bystimulating an increased consumption by children of larger families of those foods,the most important of which is milk.4. Since the Committee so reported, we have received and studied the resultsof the National Food Survey for the last quarter of 1953 and provisional figuresfor the first quarter of 1954 (Appendix B). It is clear that the pattern of consumption throughout all the social classes is changing as the rigidities due torationing and controls disappear. It will take some time for a new pattern to emerge. We are glad to see, however, that during those two quarters the deterioration-tion in the diet of the larger families, referred to in C. (54) 42, appears to havebeen arrested. It is too soon to say whether the trend is reversed. The currentposition of the three-child families shows a material improvement but that ofthe four-child families is still significantly below the standard. The temporaryimprovement in the latter group&apos;s intake of protein, shown in the fourth quarterof last year, has not been maintained during the first quarter of 1954. The resultsfor the next two quarters, therefore, will have to be examined before we canconclude that the improvement is general and is more than temporary.5. In order to encourage the consumption of liquid milk, the National MilkPublicity Council for England and Wales has been revived and a Scottish MilkPublicity Council has been set up. The Councils plan to direct publicity to particular groups, especially school children and teachers, for whom brochures arenow being prepared. The work of the Councils is financed jointly by the milk marketing Boards, the distributive .and manufacturing trades and the Government.The Government has this year contributed  100,000.6. We propose to watch the effect both of this publicity campaign and ofderationing upon the diet of the larger families, and to report again to our colleagues in due course.G.

APPENDIX a standing Committee on Medical and Nutritional problems the Nutritional Position of the Larger Families-The Standing Committee on Medical and Nutritional Problems was asked bythe Ministers of Food and Health to comment, in the light of trends revealed by theNational Food Survey and any other information available, on the nutritionalposition, of the larger families, and, in particular, on the following specificquestions: -(a) Do the data from 3,000 families per quarter constitute an adequate basis for Government action in a matter of this kind?(b) Are family allowances proving inadequate or are they being spent on objects of a kind for which they are not intended?(c) Does the decreased consumption of calcium and protein in the largerfamilies reflect under-nourishment of children or of parents?The Committee considered additional information collected by the two Depart-ments bearing on these questions and makes the following comments:  1. The size and sub-division of the samples taken were adequate. Precautionswere taken to see that the basic data collected were accurate. From the statistical point of view the samples are reliable enough to be taken asan appropriate basis for considering the trends in the nutritionalposition of the larger families in the years concerned.2. The nutritional assessments are based on accepted analytical data for con-converting individual foods into nutritional equivalents and upon theBritish Medical Association^ recommended scales of requirements.3. Compared with households without children or with only one or two children the larger families devote a much higher proportion of their income to food: 40 to 45 per cent., and in the lower income groups over50 per cent. They are, therefore, especially sensitive to increases in food prices. Consumption per head of foods rich in protein and/or calcium,such as milk, meat and eggs, has for many years been lower in the largerfamilies. Since 1950 their consumption of these foods has fallen relative to the national average, and there has been an absolute decline in theirprotein and calcium consumption expressed as a percentage of requirements.4. It is not possible for the Committee to say whether or not family allowances are inadequate or are being spent on objects of a kind for which theywere not intended. The Committee understands that when family allow-ances were instituted they were described as being intended to &quot; assist &quot;the families in receipt of them and that the Government has never sug-gested that they should be devoted to any particular purpose. It is plain that they cannot be expected to meet the cost of keeping the additionalchild, even on a subsistence basis, since the amounts for children in theNational Assistance Board&apos;s scale have for a number of years been substantially higher. The only comments that the Committee can makeare these: if the additional income provided by family allowances wereto be entirely devoted to food it would fall short of the additional expenditure actually incurred by larger families on food for the children in respect of whom the allowances are given; further, this additional expenditure does not a present suffice to keep the dietary standard as high as that in childless households, even though the larger familiestend to concentrate their expenditure on the cheaper foods. The Surveyindicates that the consumption of luxury foods by large families is relatively low.5. The Survey does not provide any information regarding the adequacy ofthe diets of different members of a family and it is impossible to say whether the reductions in the consumption of foods rich in protein andcalcium fall more heavily upon the children or the adults in the largerfamilies.
6. The Committee has found only, slender indirect evidence bearing on recentchanges in the nutritional state of children. For many years children of small families in Grades III, IV and V of the Registrar-GeneraFssocial classification have been observed to be of better physique thanthose from large families in the same social grades. There is not thesame difference between large and small families in Grades I and II(i.e., in general the professional and higher income groups). The annuaireports of school medical officers give some indication of current trends in the heights and weights of children. These are not complete butshow that weights of children on the whole tended to increase between1948 and 1950 and to decrease between 1950 and 1953. The variationis however no greater than approximately \ lb. up or down on average.It is not known to what extent this fall was concentrated in the largerfamilies. Slightly smaller reductions in weight were observed in the years1940 and 1941 and 1945 to 1947 when food supplies were less than inthe preceding years. Reductions in weight in children do not necessarilyimply that they are not consuming enough food, for they may result from other causes, such as sickness. Nevertheless, the coincidence ofthese reductions in weight and in general food consumption in the years in question makes it very probable that they are related.7. The school medical officers do not report any worsening of the health of school children, and there is no present evidence of any real nutritionaldeterioration. A small variation from the British Medical Association^recommended scales of nutrient requirements cannot be regarded as very serious, but the Committee consider that the indication given by the downward trend in the Food Survey should be heeded, and that it wouldbe desirable and appropriate to stimulate an increased consumption offoods rich in calcium and protein, the most important of which is milk,by the children of larger families so as to reverse the trend.8.
