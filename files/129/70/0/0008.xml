(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)secret.(54) 258 COPY NO.27th July, 1954CABINETTARRANT RUSHTON AIRFIELDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department and Minister for Welsh affairs at their meeting on 2nd June (C. C. (54) 37th Conclusions, Minute 5)the Cabinet appointed a Committee under my Chairmanship to review the plans for the future use of Tarrant Rushton airfield and to submit their recommendations to the Cabinet.    Although the Committee have not yetcompleted their investigations, I think it may be convenient to my colleagues to have this advance indication of the nature of the problems which arise,and of the Committee&apos;s views upon them;Background to the present problemZi        Tarrant Rushton airfield in Dorset was built during the war onrequisitioned land.    It was allocated for use as an airfield by the Govern-ment in 1947 and has always been regarded as an important airfield whichwill be needed in war.    The Air Ministry have not so far acquired theland because, under the policy of methodically disposing of requisitionedland, the most urgent cases have been disposed of first.    In fact, the plan is to use the airfield in war for the despatch of the immediate reinforce-ments required by overseas theatres.3.        In 1947 Sir Alan Cobham was granted temporary accommodationthere for his company, Flight Refuelling Ltd.     The company was, therefore,in occupation of the airfield on the &quot;Appointed Day&quot; under the Town and country Planning Act, 1947, and the land has since been scheduled as an airfield in the Dorset County Development Plan.    In 1948 the question ofthe use of the airfield was referred to the appropriate Regional Distribu-tion of Industry Panel, who ruled that there was no objection to continuedallocation of part of the airfield to Flight Refuelling Ltd. for short-termindustrial purposes, but stated that they would not regard longer-termoccupation with favour in view of the local labour shortage.    Since thenSir Alan Cobham has been granted two separate short-term occupancies,terminable if the airfield were required by the R.A.F. in an emergency;the second of these will expire in November, 1954.    In 1953 Sir Alan Cobhamasked for longer-term security of tenure.    &quot;Panel B&quot; of the Board ofTrade Committee on Distribution of Industry considered the matter and decided not to object to a lease of 21 years, subject to the observance of certain conditions which would prevent further expansion of theindustrial activity of Flight Refuelling Ltd.    Accordingly, Sir Alan Cobhamwas informed that a long lease would be granted if the Air Ministry had acquired the freehold of the land, provided planning approval were obtained for the continued industrial use of the buildings he was occupying.    In
1Ufact no such, approval will be required since the present use will be alegally established use of the land when the requisition comes to an end.Any new use or building would, however, be subject to control by the local planning authority.    Though Tarrant Rushton airfield appeared as an air-field in the Dorset County Development Plan, which was open during 1953for public inspection and the lodging of objections, it was not apparentfrom the Plan that the airfield was to be used for industrial activities.The public enquiry into the County Development Plan is now closed and thePlan is awaiting the final approval of the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment.Present situation.        The work which is being done by Flight Refuelling Ltd. consists of overhauls of Meteor aircraft and Merlin engines, testing of Vampireaircraft, modifying of aircraft from the Royal Aircraft Establishment atFarnborough, construction of fuselages for Sea Hawks, fuelling tests and experimental work in connection with refuelling (including the manufactureof flight refuelling equipment and pressure apparatus), and the maintenanceof the motor transport fleet of the company.    In addition to this work,Sir Alan Cobham has started certain small-scale extraneous enterprises,such as carpet making, on the airfield, but, as a result of objections whichhave been raised to these, he has undertaken to discontinue them.5.        The company now employs about 890 people on the airfield.    Mostof these are transported daily from neighbouring towns, but about 120 are living in temporary huts on the airfield.    Sir Alan Cobjham is endeavouringto secure the consent of the local authorities to the building of a housingestate of 200-300 houses at Blandford, which is about four miles away.Objections to the present use of the airfield6.        These developments have naturally caused anxiety amongst theowners of the land concerned, 66 acres of which belong to the Crichelestate (Lt. &quot;Cmdr. Marten) and 398 acres to the Harding family (also concerned in the Crichel Down case).    Protests have been made to air Ministry, questions raised in Parliament and letters written to thePress.    These objections may be summarised as follows:-(i) it is considered to.be wrong in principle that the Govern&quot;ment should acquire land under the Defence Acts andthen use it for some different purpose;(ii) the activities of Flight Refuelling Ltd. will result in permanent industrialisation of the area, all of whichis scheduled by the Planning Authority as pre-dominantly agricultural;(iii) the effects of the industrial activity at the airfieldwill be harmful to local agricultural interests,through pressure on existing housing accommodation and the drawing-off of labour from agriculture;(iv) no tenant has been considered for the buildings on the airfield other than Flight Refuelling Ltd.The objectors have specifically stated that they do not oppose theacquiring of the airfield if it is required for defence; but that they dooppose its being acquired for defence and used for industrial purposes.-2-
7.        In view of these criticisms, an informal meeting of the planning committee of the Dorset County Council was held on 21st June, 1954 atthe airfield.    This was attended by members of the County planning committee, Sir Alan Cobham, Lt. Cmdr. Marten, and representatives ofthe local branch of the National Farmers&apos; Union, the Country LandownersAssociation and the Blandford Rural District Council.    The Under-Secretary of State for Air and the Regional Officer of the Ministry of housing and Local Government also attended.    Representatives of theCounty Planning Committee pointed out that no objections had been raised to the use of the airfield under the County Development Plan.Lt. Cmdr. Marten, however, and others voiced their objections to theindustrial use of the airfield, and stated that they could not haveapprehended from the County Development Plan that the airfield would continue to be used for Sir Alan Cobham&apos;s activities until it was broughtinto use for defence.    As a result of this meeting the County planning committee have informed the Ministry of Housing and Local Governmentthat they have no objection to the continuance of the present industrialactivities of Flight Refuelling Ltd. on the airfield, provided certain conditions are observed, and that they do not desire any further enquiryof a more formal character into the use of the airfield.    The conditionssuggested are as follows:-(i) that there should be no industrial activities on the airfield other than those connected with aircraftmanufacture and maintenance;(ii) that the labour force should be limited to the capacity of the existing buildings;(iii) that it must be understood that requests for planning permission for further industrial building will notbe favourably considered;(iv)that, apart from the re-housing of families at presentliving in huts, there should be no specific housingprovision in the area for the employees of FlightRefuelling Ltd.Arguments for granting a long lease to Flight Refuelling Ltd.8.        In considering whether a long lease of the airfield should begranted to Flight Refuelling Ltd., the Committee have had their attentiondrawn to the following considerations(i) much of the work of Flight Refuelling Ltd. is essentialto the defence programme, its research work intoflight refuelling being of particular importance;(ii) work of this type has to be done on an airfield;if it were not done at Tarrant Rushton, an alternativeairfield would have to be provided for the purpose and, as most airfields are in rural areas, theproblem would be more likely to be transferredelsewhere than avoided altogether;(iii) the immediate occupation of the airfield by the R.A.F.in an emergency will only be possible if buildings,runways etc. are fully maintained; there is thus a clear gain to the R.A.F. in this maintenance work being done by Flight Refuelling Ltd.
7(iv)the Government are committed to granting Sir Alan Cobhama lease, provided there are no planning objections.He has invested substantial sums of money in FlightRefuelling Ltd. , much of it with Government en-encouragement.    If he were to be turned out now, hewould face serious financial loss and would justifiablyconsider that he had been let down by the Government.To force the closing down of the activities of FlightRefuelling Ltd. at Tarrant Rushton would also be unpopular with its many employees and with some local interests, whose objections to Lt.-Cmdr. Marten&apos;campaing are now beginning to be voiced.(v) Flight Refuelling Ltd. pays a rent of  6,000 a year;this is very much more than could be obtained forthe use of the buildings for an agricultural purpose;(vi)even if it should be decided to grant a lease toFlight Refuelling Ltd. , it should be possible toincrease the amount of land on the airfield which is atpresent in use for agriculture.Re commendation9.        For these reasons the Committee agreed to recommend thata 21-year lease should be granted to Flight Refuelling Ltd. as soon asthe Air Ministry has completed the purchase of the airfield.    However,in order to meet, so far as possible, the objections which have been raised to the continued industrial use of the airfield, the committee consider it essential that the terms of the lease to be granted to FlightRefuelling Ltd. should fully safeguard the conditions laid down by theCounty Planning Authority (paragraph 7 above).    In addition, the leasewould, of course, safeguard the requirements of the Air Ministry forany necessary peacetime use of the airfield and its re-occupation inan emergency. -Public Enquiry10.      The Committee have also considered whether it would bedesirable to agree to some form of public enquiry if the objectors to thepresent use of the airfield should continue to press their case.    this aspect of the problem clearly raises delicate issues at the present timeand I shall hope to make recommendations to the Cabinet orally upon it after a further meeting of the Committee.D.M.F.Home Office, S.W.1.27th July, 1954.
