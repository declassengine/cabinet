(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNB.CENT)SECRET.0.(5*0 283     , COPY NO.^V6th September. 195UCABINETGERMAN TENDERS FOR THE NEW CONWAY BRIDGEMemorandum by the Minister of Transport&quot; and&apos; Civil AviationMy Department advertised in June for tenders for theconstruction of a steel bridge at Convray, estimated to cost 450,000 to carry the trunk road, and this has led to inquiriesfrom the representatives of two German firms of structuralengineers asking whether tenders from their principals would beconsidered.     The names of the firms are:-Dortmunder Briickenbau G. H. JuchoMaschinenfabrik Augsburg-nurnberg A. G.2.     The Economic Policy Committee discussed the question on29th July (E.A. (54)90 and minutes of 19th meeting) and agreed inprinciple that the German firm (an inquiry on behalf of only onefirm was then before the Committee) should be allowed to tender.It was thought that refusal would be in breach of the O.E.E.C,Code on the liberalisation of transactions in invisibles andwould be inconsistent with our own frequent representations tothe United States Government in regard to contracts for publicworks in that country.     The West German Government had recently announced their intention of allowing foreign firms outside the dollar area to tender for public contracts if the foreign country concerned gave reciprocal treatment to German firms,saying, however, that they would give some measure of preference to German firms which relied on larp;e public contracts.     this reservation made it possible for us to consider similarpreference for British firms.3.     The Economic Policy Committee left the subsequent handling of the matter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and after discussion between my Department and the Treasury I now propose(a) that my Department should write to the representativesof the two German firms saying that I shall beprepared to consider tenders from their principalsand for this purpose have extended the period forreceipt of tenders by eight weeks;    and calling attention to (1) a clause in the conditions of contract which requires that, save with my consent, noimported materials or plant and no manufacturedmaterials or plant not wholly manufactured in theBritish Empire shall be used on the worksj    andpossibly also (2) the clause requiring the contractorto comply with the fair wages, etc., resolution of theHouse of Commons;    and(b) to write to the President of the Federation of civil engineering Contractors as in the annex to this paper, a similar letter being sent to the Presidentof the British Constructional Steelwork Association.
k.     If the German firms&apos;ask to be relieved from the conditionabout imported materials, I propose to inform them that I am not prepared to waive the condition at this stage and that &apos;tenders must therefore be submitted on a &quot;no imports&quot; basis,but that the Germans might, if they wished, append a footnoteindicating what their tender would be if imports were allowed.5.     If a German tender is received and is the lowest, either on a &quot;no imports&quot; basis or on the basis of using imported materials, I should propose to refer the matter to the cabinet again for decision.     After a long period of extreme scarcity of important road and bridge contracts in Great Britain theaward of this contract to a foreign firm would be a bitterdisappointment to the home industry.J.A.  B-C.Ministry of Transport and civil Aviation, W. 1.6th September, 1954
Draft letter to Sir George Burt. President of the Federation ofCivil Engineering Contractors 1You should know that after tenders had been invited for theconstruction of the new bridge at Conway inquiries were receivedfrom the representatives in this country of&quot;two German firms of structural engineers whether tenders from German firms for this work would be considered.     Very careful consideration has beengiven to the matter,  and it has been decided that the Germanfirms should be allowed to tender for this work in conformitywith the policy of the Government which seeks to secure freedom from controls and restrictions on trade.     The Government are trying to open up markets for our exporters and contractors byfollowing this policy, and it would be inconsistent with it torefuse to allow German firms to tender for public works in thiscountry, especially as, according to our understanding, british firms would now be allowed to tender for similar contracts inGermany.The representations on behalf of British contractors whichhave been made to the United States Administration in respectof public works in the United States are well known.     They havenot always been successful, but something has been achieved;and in the view of the Government the right course is in general to continue the process of opening up public works contracts to international tender though there will of course from time totime be special (e.g. security) considerations.We have therefore informed the representatives of the two German firms concerned that tenders from their principals wouldbe considered, and we have accordingly extended the period forthe submission of tenders until      K.     Prospective Britishtenderers have been informed of the new date for the submission of tenders.NOTE:-   A letter in similar terms would be sent to theChairman of the British Constructional SteelworkAssociation.x   Date to be inserted - will be eight weeks fromdespatch of letters to German firms.
