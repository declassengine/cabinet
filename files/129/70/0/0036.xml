(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.(54) 286 COPY NO.    ^37th September, 1954CABINETTHE FRENCH PRIME MINISTERNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate herewith for the information of my colleagues,copies of an interesting letter received at the Foreign Office from her Majesty&apos;s Minister in Paris about the character ofMonsieur Mendes&quot;France.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.7th September, 1954.BRITISH EMBASSY,PARIS.September 4, 1954.With reference to our telegrams Nos. 599 and 601 I enclosea copy of a record&quot;&apos;&quot; of conversations which I had on September 3 with Soutouand Seydoux at the Quai d&apos;Orsay, which may perhaps be useful as background to those telegrams and to our despatch No. 372 of to*-day about where exactlyMendes-France really stands.    Incidentally Margerie to-day again spokevery highly of Soutou.    He said that he had done exceptionally well at brussels and had impressed Mendes-France by foretelling correctly justwhat happened at Chartwell.    Soutou was now the Quai d^rsay^ bestchannel for getting its views considered by the President.2, I have recorded in our telegram No. 601 the main points ofmy conversation with Margerie to-day.    It is perhaps worth adding that he spoke to me with even for him exceptional frankness and with greatbitterness about the influence of Mendes-France&apos;s political entourage.    he described them as a bunch of brilliant hyper-intellectuals, extremely able in debate, but very inexperienced and handling matters of grave importancewith deplorable levity.    He obviously thought that Mendes-France listened tothem far too much and referred in particular to the fact that the opinions ofJ,J. Servan Schreiber were given as much weight as those of the mostexperienced members of the Quai d&apos;Orsay.    Discussion with Mehdes-france was very difficult.    He was an extremely able debater and he still seemedsuspicious of the permanent officials of the Quai d&apos;Orsay.4- Not circulated
/o?3. Margerie said that the Quai were trying to bring home toMendes-France that he had dissipated the capital of confidence which he hadbuilt up at Geneva and in his meetings with Dulles and the Secretary of State.He referred once more to the interview of August 12 with Dillon and myself.I gave Margerie every opportunity to say that, in spite of recent mistakes,Mendes-France was essentially sound on the main point of policy towards theRussians.    I am bound to record that he did not respond.    He referred to.therecurrence of incidents like the fact that on the French wireless this morningchief prominence had been given to a leading article in Combat saying thatthe first priority was to negotiate with the Soviet Government on disarmament.I suggested that that sort of thing might be ascribed to members of theentourage acting without Mendes-France&apos;s knowledge.    Margerie agreedthat this might be so, but remarked that Mendes-France was veryauthoritarian and liked to decide everything himself.    It was an undoubtedfact that he had tried to prevent the French radio from mentioning theimportant statement criticising the Government which was issued onSeptember 3 by several ex-Prime Ministers and others (our telegramNo. 342 Saving).4. Margerie, who was very depressed, ended by saying that someencouragement could be drawn from the appointment as Secretary of Stateof Moustier (pronounced apparently Moutier).    He entirely confirmed theview of him given in the last paragraph of our telegram No. 346 Saving ofto-day.    He was only astonished that Moustier had been willing to takethe job.5. On the question of Mendes-France&apos;s essential soundness on themain issue, these conversations suggest some difference of view betweenSoutou and Margerie.    Soutou was of course speaking as a loyal private secretary should.    I do not think that Margerie&apos;s remarks should be taken as conclusive evidence against Mendes-France.    They do however showthat the influence of the non-official entourage is still very strong and bad.6. I think that Soutou may be right in saying that Mendes &quot;-france might well be followed by a neutralist Government.    I am sure that bothhe and Margerie are right about the present temper of the Assembly andthat Mendes-France would have no difficulty in getting a massive vote for rejecting anything that he described to the Assembly as unacceptable terms for German rearmament.7. It is odd that the Quai d&apos;Orsay seem to have nothing definiteto say about an alternative solution.    It is possible that they do not genuinelyknow what is in Mendes-France&apos;s mind.    The papers suggest that he isactively working on proposals at Marly and it would be unlike him not to betackling something definite.    But it is possible that he has in fact nothing more definite in mind than the ideas, which he sketched to the Ambassadoras reported in our telegram No. 599.8. I feel I must conclude by saying that it remains quite clearthat, as we have so often reported, the one thing that could quickly pull avast majority of the French people together on a solution is one that madethem feel that Britain is not merely at their side, but is together with france inside some organisation which is smaller than, and especiallytighter than N.A.T.O.
