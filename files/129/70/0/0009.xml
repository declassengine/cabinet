confidential.(54) 259 COPY NO.27th July, 1954CABINETGIBRALTAR;  COST-OF-LIVING allowance for INDUSTRIAL workers memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theFirst Lord of the AdmiraltyWe consider that the memorandum by the Minister of Labour(C. (54) 253) does not give adequate weight to the arguments adduced bythe Treasury and the Service Departments against abolishing the differential in the cost-of-living allowances; nor does it mention thesolution we have proposed.2.        Abolition of the differential in cost-of-living allowances is supported in C. (54) 253 by four main arguments:-(1)     The rate for the jobWe cannot see how the principle of the rate for the jobcan be held to apply to the present problem, which is simplyone of relative costs of living.(2)    A permanent solutionThere are reasons for thinking that this course wouldnot provide a permanent solution.    It would mean thatSpaniards would be able to live at a higher standard thanGibraltarians, unless the Spanish Government, by manipulatingthe exchange rate, reduced the number of pesetas whichSpanish workers can get in exchange for their earnings in gibraltar.    If they manipulated the exchange in this way,the Spanish workers would not then benefit and the extramoney (about  150,000 a year), found by the British tax-payer, would simply flow into the Spanish Treasury.(3)    No other way of removing discrimination on grounds ofnationalityGibraltarians get the full rate even if they live in Spain,but Spaniards get the half rate even if they live in Gibraltar.This is the only element in the present arrangement whichsavours of national discrimination and to remedy it theTreasury and the Service Departments have proposed togive the full Gibraltarian rate to any Spanish workers wholive in Gibraltar.    The Colonial Office have not beencontent with this proposal.
Jo(4)    Policy followed generally by private employersIt is suggested that private employers generally pay thesame wage rates and cost-of-living allowance toGibraltarians and Spaniards alike.    But according to therates quoted in the Annex to C. (54) 253, it appears that private employers pay all their workers the same rate asthe Service Departments pay the Spaniards.Accordingly we do not think that the arguments advanced in C. (54) 253 forabolishing the differential can be sustained.3.        The present difference between the Gibraltarian and Spanish rates(24s. Od. ) may be somewhat more than it should be according to the costsquoted in the Annex to C. (54) 253.    The Treasury and the Service Depart-ments have offered to increase the Spanish rate of cost-of-living allowanceby 10s. Od. a week which would leave a differential of 14s. Od. a week or about  3 a month.     This solution has been criticised on the ground thatit does not take into account travelling costs for those living in Spain,which are stated to be  2 a month.    We do not agree.    Our information is that the average cost of fares for Spanish workers living in Spain wouldbe nearer to 15s. Od. than to  2 a month.4.        Finally, we doubt whether the Spaniards employed in Gibraltarfeel as strongly on this issue as has sometimes been supposed.    We arenot aware of any agitation on this subject among Spanish workers in gibraltar.R.A.B.J.P.L.T.27th July, 1954.
