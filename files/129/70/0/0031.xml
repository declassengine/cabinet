SECRET Copy No.   6C. (54) 2811st September, 1954CABINETPAKISTAN: ADOPTION OF REPUBLICAN constitution memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth RelationsAs I reported at the. meeting of the. Cabinet on the 16th, September, 1953(C.C. (53) 53rd Conclusions, Minute. 2), it became clear a year ago that therewas, no hope of deterring the Pakistanis, from going over, when their newConstitution was complete, to a Republican; form of Government, though it was almost certain that they would ask to remain, like, India,, a full Member of theCommonwealth. Progress by the Constituent Assembly with the framing ofthe new Constitution has during the last 12 months continued to be slow,largely due in the first instance to concentration on the important elections tothe East Bengal Legislature early this year, and since then to the repercussions of the Muslim League&apos;s unexpected and overwhelming defeat ih those elections.This defeat made it necessary to reconsider the fundamental question of the futuredistribution of power between the Central Government and the Provinces. Thesolution of this question is now likely to be finalised by the Constituent assembly at any moment and when this has been done the Constituent Assembly will have completed consideration of the provisions of the new Constitution, and it willremain only to introduce and pass a Bill embodying them in proper legal form.Our High Commissioner has been informed that the Pakistanis hope to introduce such a Bill at the beginning of November, and to pass it, apart from the clausebringing the new Constitution into operation, about six weeks later. There wouldthen be an interval of about two months before the Constitution was actuallybrought into operation. We may thus expect Pakistan to become a Republic aboutthe middle of February 1955.2. At the Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting of April 1949, which decided that india should remain in the Commonwealth, though becoming a sovereign independentRepublic, the following minute was agreed at the suggestion of the Prime Ministerof Pakistan:  &apos;.&apos; In answer to a question put by the Prime Minister of Pakistan whetheranother Member of the Commonwealth could continue Membership of theCommonwealth under conditions identical with those which had been accepted in respect of India, it was put on record as the opinion of the Meeting thatwhile it was not possible to bind future Ministers or Governments it couldbe logically assumed that a future Meeting would accord the same treatment to any other Member as had been accorded to India by this Meeting.&quot;3. We and other Commonwealth Governments may now expect to receive atany time a formal request from the Pakistan Government to be allowed to remain within the Commonwealth. It has, of course, always been implicitly understoodthat Pakistan could, if she chose, have the same status within the commonwealth as India, and my Colleagues will no doubt wish to authorise me:  (i) to inform other Members of the Commonwealth when the Pakistanrequest is received, that the United Kingdom Government are, for their part, prepared to return a favourable answer and, assuming (as I wouldanticipate) that this view was shared by other Governments,(ii) to arrange for the matter to be placed on record in some suitable formalmanner.46763Printed for the Cabinet.

4. Pakistani change over to Republican status does not in itself involve any formal action on our part. I anticipate, however, that, as was done in the caseof India, it will be necessary to introduce and pass a short, technical Pakistan,. (Consequential Provision) Bill, prior to the date when Pakistan actually becomes(J i I a Republic. In the absence of such legislation (for which a place has been reservedin the programme for the coming Session), the legal position in regard to Pakistanisand Pakistan goods in the United Kingdom would become confused, and therewould be many unforeseeable consequences throughout the very large large field of United Kingdom law relating to Her Majesty&apos;s Dominions. I therefore recommend that Parliamentary Counsel should now prepare a draft of the necessaryUnited Kingdom legislation to take account of the coming constitutional changesin Pakistan.5.   I accordingly seek authority:  (1) to indicate to other Members of the Commonwealth, on receipt ofa request from the Pakistan Government to retain her Membership of theCommonwealth after becoming a Republic, that the United KingdomGovernment are willing to agree, and, subject to the views of other Members,to arrange for the matter to be placed on record in some suitably formal way;(2) for Parliamentary Counsel to prepare legislation to make the necessary provision as to the operation of United Kingdom law against Pakistani comingchange of Constitution, with a view to its introduction and passage prior tothe actual date of the change.SWINTON.Commonwealth Relations Office,27th August, 1954.
