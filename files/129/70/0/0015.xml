Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1954CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.ggC. (54) 2654th August, 1954 -.,    .cabinet public ACCESS TO CABINET RECORDSNote by the Secretary of the CabinetThe Chancellor of the Exchequer has presented to Parliament the report(Cmd. 9163) of the Committee which has examined, under the Chairmanship ofSir James Grigg, the problems arising from the ever-growing bulk of departmentalrecords. The Treasury are obtaining the views of Departments on the recom-mendations made in the report. Meanwhile, Ministers may wish to give immediate consideration to one recommendation which specifically affects them-namely,that Cabinet records should be opened to inspection in the Public Record Officewhen they are fifty years old.2. No Government has ever considered the question whether and, if so,after what lapse of time the records of the Cabinet should be opened to public inspection. The main considerations bearing on this question are summarised in paragraph 146 of the Grigg Committee&apos;s report. It is there stated that these papers constitute the most valuable single collection of material for historicalpurposes that can be obtained from official sources, and that it is reasonable thathistorians should at some stage be given access to them. On the other hand,it is recognised that premature disclosure of these documents would involve bothadministrative and constitutional difficulties. For Government administration should not be handicapped by the premature publication of official information.Nor should anything be done which would hamper the personal or collective responsibility of Ministers. The Committee considered that both these dangerscould be avoided under a system by which Cabinet papers were not opened to public inspection until they were fifty years old.3. Cabinet proceedings were not regularly recorded until the appointmentof the Cabinet Secretariat in 1916. Until then, though memoranda were sometimescirculated, no minutes of the Cabinefs proceedings were kept. Thus, under afifty-year rule, no regular series of Cabinet records would be made available for public inspection until 1967.The proceedings of the Committee of Imperial Defence were, however,regularly recorded from its inception in 1904. Under a fifty-year rule the seriesof memoranda and minutes of this Committee would begin to become availableto the public in 1955.4. Ministers may be ready to concede the claim that Cabinet records should at some stage be made available to historians. If so, the question for decision is how long a time should elapse before they are made available. Discretion wouldbe retained to exempt certain documents of special secrecy from any general rule,and all documents would be scrutinised with this in view before transfer to thePublic Record Office. Subject to this discretion to make exceptions, it may bethought that a round term of fifty years is long enough to avoid impairing theprinciple of Ministerial responsibility, collective or individual, and short enough tosatisfy historians that they will have access to documents of their own time.5.   There is a further argument in favour of a period of fifty years.   TheGrigg Committee recommend that Departmental records should also be madeaccessible to the public after fifty years.  Clearly, Cabinet documents should not46572

If Ministers accepted the recommendation that the records of -the cabinet and its Committees should be made available for public inspection after^a lapse of fifty years, two further steps would need to be. taken before the new practice couldbe brought into operation. First, it would be necessary to secure the agreement ofthe leaders of the two Opposition Parties.  Secondly, The Queen&apos;s assent would need to be obtained.(Signed)        NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,30th July; H 954.
