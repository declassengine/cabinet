[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)&quot;-l^----------------------------------- - .--- .  ua-----  ^.a u .... n.... mo CON FIDE confidential .C.(54) 266COPY NO.6th August, 1954CABINETANGLOrPOLISH relations the KLIMQWICZ CASEMemorandum by the Minister of state think the Cabinet would wish to be informed of the reaction of thePolish Government to the forcible removal of a stowaway, Klimowicz, fromthe Polish ship YAROSLAV DABROVSKI in the Thames on the night of saturday, 31st July.2. H.M. Ambassador at Warsaw reports that he received a strongoral protest from the Polish Minister for Foreign Affairs on 1st August.The latter expressed his surprise that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould have behaved in this manner when important commercial andfinancial negotiations were nearing agreement.    He asserted that theKlimowicz case could not fail to have unfavourable effects on Anglo-Polish relations.3.        This oral protest has been followed by a Note, which has alreadybeen published, claiming that the action taken by Her Majesty&apos;s. Governmentwith regard to the Polish ship was not justified by international law orinternational custom.    The Polish Government demands the return ofKLimowicz, compensation for losses resulting from the detention of theship and for the injuries alleged to have been suffered by Polish seamen and the punishment of those responsible.4.        H. M. Ambassador at Warsaw reports that the Polish government feel very strongly about the incident.    He fears that the progress whichhas recently been made in the repatriation of British-born wives of polish citizens will be interrupted.5.        The Ambassador considers that the decision to grant Xlirnowiczasylum may also lead the Polish Governmentto suspend the current commercial and financial negotiations.    The leader of the financial delegation hasin fact protested at what he called the flagrant violation of internationalrules and announced that he has been recalled to Warsaw for further instructions.6.        The trade agreement, which is for three years, provides for united Kingdom imports from Poland of about  20 millions (including70,000 standards of softwood and some 40,000 tons of bacon) and UnitedKingdom exports to Poland of about  7 millions (including quotas for complete motor vehicles, rayon yarns and herrings).   The financial
agreement provides for the payment to British claimants of  6 millionscompensation over a period of some 12 years.    This is in respect ofGovernment bonds, claims for nationalised property, commercialdebts, etc.7.        It is, of course, not yet certain that any of these adverseresults will in fact follow from the action taken over Klimowicz.S.L.Foreign Office, S. W.l.6th August, 1954.
