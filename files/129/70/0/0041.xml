SECRET Copy No.C. (54) 29115th September, 1954CABINETSOUTH AFRICAN DEFENCE TALKSMemorandum by the Minister of Defence and the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth relations we have to report the conclusion of our talks with the South African Ministerof Defence.2. In accordance with the Cabinet instruction (C.C. (54) 59th Conclusions,Minute 11) we avoided any commitment over Simonstown. We put it toMr. Erasmus that substantial progress had been made over a wide field in defence -operation and that clearly much further work and discussion would be required before any final agreements could be contemplated.3. He could not hide his disappointment. He pointed out that hisGovernment, believing in the firmness of our friendship and the certainty that wewould be together in any future war, was ready to guarantee the use of Simonstownto the Royal Navy and its allies in war. They had been very patient and, nowthey had met us fully on this crucial point (which had been the stumbling blockin their negotiations with the previous Government in 1951), surely negotiations were not going to be allowed to break down over details? Could we not reach some understanding at least in principle?4. We told him that the continued efficiency of the base, the guarantee of facilities for the Royal Navy and our Commander-in-Chief, and the adequate protection of the sea lanes round Africa were all matters of fact, about which wemust have certainty. All these questions and others, must be looked atcomprehensively. This we were ready to do.5. Mr. Erasmus said it was important that the negotiations should becontinued without any avoidable interruption. How should we proceed? we suggested that an Admiralty mission should go to South Africa to work out onthe spot with the South Africans a practical plan covering both Simonstown and theestablishment of the new Commander-in-Chief at the Cape. We reiterated thatthis involved no commitment, but, if a sound and comprehensive plan emerged,which held definite advantage for us, we would be prepared to put it to our colleagues.6. He accepted this and agreed also to continued study of arrangements forthe defence of the Middle East and the South African contribution to it. (his chief of General Staff talked of sending South African units for peace-timetraining in the Middle East.) We said we would look at his plan for an Africanregional organisation, but that it must clearly be complementary to soundarrangements in the Middle East.7.  He agreed that publicity was best avoided meantime.46818bPrinted for the Cabinet. September 1954
8. The record of our closing talks is attached as Annex A. The Admiraltyhas the despatch of a suitable mission in hand. Their terms of reference, whichhave been telegraphed to Mr. Erasmus, are in Annex B.9. We are bound to state our conviction that, if further negotiations should result in a sound and comprehensive plan guaranteeing all we need, this would clearly be to our advantage, and rejection of it would jeopardise the whole range of South African co-operation with us. We shall report more fully on this whennegotiations have progressed further.10. Meantime we should ask the Cabinet to take note of the outcome oflast week&apos;s talks.A.SWINTON.15th September, 1954.Annex ASECRET-Note of Discussions with the South African Minister of defence on Friday, 10th September, 1954Present:  Field Marshal the Right Hon. EarlAlexander of Tunis, United kingdom minister of Defence.The Right Hon. Viscount Swinton,Secretary of State for commonwealth relations.The Hon. F. C. Erasmus, M.P., Ministerof Defence, Union of South Africa.His Excellency Mr. G. R Jooste, HighCommissioner for the Union ofSouth Africa.Mr. W. A. W. Clark, C.R.O.At 12-00 noon in Lord Alexanders roomMr. Erasmus had listed three items for discussion: -(1) The future of Simons town.(2) The establishment of an African defence organisation.(3) The Union contribution to Middle East defence in war.Lord Alexander suggested that they might begin with the proposal for an Africandefence organisation.I. Proposal for Establishment of an African Defence OrganisationLord Alexander said that the proposal in Mr. Erasmus&apos;s letter of6th September would be examined carefully. For the present he could do no morethan give the United Kingdom&apos;s preliminary reactions. The proposal could notbe considered in isolation. It must be looked at in the light of the major strategic and military requirements. The United Kingdom was convinced that it was in theMiddle East, and as far north as possible, that the defence of the African continentrested. Everything else should be subordinate to that. There were good hopesnow, with a settlement in Egypt, the Turkish-Pakistan Pact and the rightatmosphere developing, that a sound organisation for the defence of the middle east could be established. The South African proposal could perhaps be fitted in
with this; some organisation in Africa would be invaluable to supplement andreinforce the Middle East set-up, particularly on the logistics and communicationsside. But the whole picture called for study and the attitude of otherGovernments must be taken into account.Mr. Erasmus said that it would not accord with the South african government^ ideas to subordinate the proposed African regional organisation toany other body. N.A.T.O. and S.E.A.T.O. were not adjuncts of other bodies;they stood on their own feet. Lord Alexander had talked of a Middle Eastorganisation which was admittedly necessary, but the Middle East properconsisted of Egypt, the Arab States and a bit of the North African littoral. Whatthe South African Government had in mind was the security of the hinterland ofthe Union, i.e. Africa south of the Sahara. Could he assume from LordAlexanders remarks that the United Kingdom Government was agreeable inprinciple to such an organisation?Lord Alexander and Lord Swinton explained:  (1) It was premature to assume United Kingdom acceptance even inprinciple; the South African proposal would be studied and the UnitedKingdom Government could only form an opinion once they saw howit fitted in with the demands of global strategy, developments in theMiddle East, &amp;c.(2) &quot; Subordinate&quot; was the wrong word; they had in mind that any organisation, which might be set up in Africa, would be a usefulcomplement to what must, in their opinion, come first the soundorganisation of Middle East defence.(3) Once the Middle East was adequately secured, other things would begin to fall into place; the sea defences of the continent would have to be properly organised and then it could be seen what was needed in otherparts of Africa.(4) In their experience, one aimed first at being strong at the main strategicpoint or points; from this focal point of mutual interest co-operationdeveloped and a sound and effective organisation emerged; if you gotoff on the wrong foot, then things tended to go awry.Mr. Jooste pointed out that the absence of an organisation catering specificallyfor the defence of Africa left a very large gap in the world pattern of&quot; regional organisations. This gap should be plugged. Further, he had no doubt that hisGovernment felt that, if they were to assume increasing commitments, it was onlyreasonable that they should do so under the  egis of some structure or instrument,which would assure to South Africa in return the security and integrity of itshinterland.Mr. Erasmus confirmed this and added that, while they did not contest theimportance of the Middle East (in which they were prepared to play their part),it was a long way from South Africa and he was anxious to see adequatearrangements made to combat possible dangers nearer home.Lord Alexander remarked that correct strategy often entailed fighting battlesfar away; it was greatly to the credit of the people of the United States, includingthe Middle West, that they so readily accepted this when they took up arms in korea. The Middle East was the northern gateway to Africa which all interestedcountries should first band themselves together in securing. Next came the sealanes and then the hinterland. He confirmed in reply to Mr. Erasmus&apos;s enquirythat, although the United States would not necessarily be a member of a middle east defence organisation, in his view they would be inescapably involved in any war in the area. For example, in any European war their strategic bomber force would be engaged in the Caucasus from North African bases.Mr. Erasmus then enquired whether suitable reference to his proposal couldbe made in any statement issued at the conclusion of the talks.Lord Alexander and Lord Swinton said that they thought this might do more harm than good. Other Governments were involved, and, as they had said, theSouth African proposal must be looked at in the light of the whole strategicpicture. They would prefer that any statement at this stage should not makespecific reference to the proposal.46818b 2
iii. The Union Contribution to Middle East Defence in WarLord Alexander expressed his regrets that the South African Government hadnot been earlier informed that the 1951 Conference paper, listing forces for theMiddle East, had been overtaken and that United Kingdom dispositions and policy were being examined afresh. He assured Mr. Erasmus that, as soon as this review was complete, an up-to-date appreciation would be supplied. He confirmed thatthis would cover the commitments of New Zealand, Australia and the rhodesia and Nyasaland Federation, as well as the United Kingdom. The closestco-operation in planning was essential and it might be worth looking at thearrangements for day-to-day military liaison with South Africa. He thought this might be improved.Mr. Jooste said that these arrangements were under review and LordAlexander offered the assistance and advice of the Ministry of Defence and theChiefs of Staff in perfecting contact.III. Future of SimonstownLord Alexander explained that this too could not be considered in isolation.It was a problem to which he hoped a satisfactory answer could be found, givengoodwill and careful study. He was aware of the importance attached politicallyin South Africa to transfer of the base, but he must remind Mr. Erasmus that therewas a strong body of public opinion in the United Kingdom that regarded the base as essential, as indeed it was, to the operations of the Royal Navy and thesecurity of Commonwealth communications. In the interests of both countries,the question must be approached with great tact and understanding on both sides.Until he had opportunity recently to study the question, he had no idea thatthere were so many practical difficulties. These must be thrashed out, togetherwith the pattern of the new set-up for the United Kingdom Commander-in-Chief.The joint working party in London had not produced a plan, but rather a statementof the points on which the two sides still differed.Mr. Erasmus&apos;s opinon was that the working party had in fact made considerable progress. He had hoped that it would be possible, while he was inLondon, to dispose of the outstanding points.Lord Swinton recalled that he and Lord Alexander had said that, if a sound and comprehensive plan could be evolved, they would be prepared to recommend it to their colleagues. No such plan had been produced. But he and LordAlexander were ready to continue examination of the questions at issue. Indeed,they had been so authorised, but it would obviously take time.Mr. Erasmus said that he found this very disappointing. His Governmenthad authorised him to meet the United Kingdom 100 per cent, on the questionof availability to the Royal Navy and its allies in war. The United kingdom representatives had then demanded assurances that the base would be efficientlyrun and the working party had gone a long way to demonstrate this. In his opinion the remaining questions could be settled quite quickly. Sentiment did enter intothe matter in South Africa, but he could assure United Kingdom Ministers thaton practical grounds the efficient development of the South African Navy was beingseriously hampered by the lack of adequate dockyard facilities. They neededSimonstown.Mr. Jooste enquired whether they could assume that the United kingdom was prepared to meet the South African request for transfer, provided they were satisfied on certain points.Lord Swinton and Lord Alexander emphasised that they were not authorisedto enter into any commitment over Simonstown. Their authority was limited to finding out, in consultation with the South African representatives, whether a workable and comprehensive plan could be evolved which the South african government accepted and which Lord Alexander, as United Kingdom Ministerof Defence, felt able to commend to the United Kingdom Cabinet.Mr- Erasmus enquired what the United Kingdom Ministers suggested as anext step.
Lord Alexander suggested that one way of making progress would be toarrange for a small United Kingdom mission to go into all the questions involvedon the spot. It would have to examine not only the arrangements regardingSimonstown, but also the organisation of the Commander-in-Chiefs new head-quarters, communications, &amp;c. If a plan emerged, he would then have to see,in consultation with the Admiralty, and the United Kingdom Chiefs of Staff, howit all tied up with United Kingdom naval requirements and the security of commonwealth communications. Only thus could it be determined whatadvantage lay to the United Kingdom in the new arrangements proposed.Mr. Erasmus reiterated his view that it should be possible to settle any majorpoints outstanding quite quickly. Was it necessary to go into every point of detailbefore deciding in principle? His Government had been very patient in thematter. They had decided that they could guarantee the United Kingdomavailability in war because of the friendship between the two countries and theknowledge that they would be together in any foreseeable war. It was on thispoint that negotiations had broken down in 1951. Now that they were preparedto meet the United Kingdom completely over availability, they had hoped that asettlement could be reached. His Government would take a very poor view of it,if he had to report to them that no settlement had been reached even in principle,because a number of minor details were still in dispute.Lord Alexander and Lord Swinton could not agree that this correctlyrepresented the position. They had reported to their colleagues that substantial progress on defence matters had been made in these talks but that clearly much further work and discussion would be required before any final agreements couldbe reached. They had accordingly been instructed to find out whether a sound,comprehensive plan, covering all aspects of the naval situation in South africa and the Southern Atlantic and having regard to the interests of the United Kingdomand other Commonwealth countries, could be evolved. No such plan had yet been drawn up, but they were very ready to go on with the task. Their suggestion of a joint committee on the spot was the best way of advancing the matter.Mr. Erasmus then asked what sort of public statement United kingdom ministers contemplated.Lord Swinton tabled a draft he had prepared of a communique in general terms.Mr. Erasmus thought that, if anything was issued jointly, it should be muchmore specific. In 1951, when the two Governments had been very close to agreement about Simonstown, a statement had been prepared setting out theproposed settlement. Could something like this not be issued now? If a mission was to go out to Simonstown, this itself would arouse speculation which a statement would forestall.Lord Swinton said that the statement, drafted in 1951, was inapplicable. no agreement had been reached. Lord Alexander and he had no authority to concludeone. All that need be said about the mission was that it was going to study detailsof practical co-operation.Mr. Erasmus said he would prefer to say nothing, rather than mislead. Hewould like to consider the United Kingdom response, which frankly disappointedhim greatly. He asked if United Kingdom Ministers could meet him again next day.  He was due to leave on Sunday, the 12th.Lord Alexander and Lord Swinton explained that they had weekendengagements.It was therefore agreed to meet again at 4-00 p.m.At 4-00 p.m. in Lord Alexanders roomMr. Erasmus said that he had had no opportunity to consult his Government.But, rather than break off negotiations, he had decided to fall in with LordAlexander^ suggestion of a joint committee to undertake a study on the spot atSimonstown. He would expect its directive to include the preparation of o, plan for the transfer of control of the base to South Africa. Its other terms of reference,e.g., arrangements for the new R.N. Command Headquarters, he was content to
leave to the United Kingdom. As for publicity, he would, as he had in the past,avoid any statement that would prejudice relations. He did not therefore wantany communique. But it must be understood that, if the joint committee produced a workable and acceptable plan and the United Kingdom Government rejected it,he would have to reconsider his attitude.Lord Alexander and Lord Swinton said they were sure this was the right wayto go about things. They were very grateful to Mr. Erasmus for having made the journey; personal contact was invaluable and they wished to assure Mr. Erasmusof the United Kingdom Goyernmenfs goodwill and desire for the closestcollaboration in defence.Mr. Erasmus said it had been remarked of South Africa that her performancewas always better than her promise. He could assure United Kingdom ministers that this was true; if a settlement could be reached over Simonstown, the UnitedKingdom would find it so. He would nominate Mr. Cuff, Secretary for Defence,to lead the South African team, which would also include Commodore Bierman;he trusted that the United Kingdom would similarly appoint officers of adequateseniority.  How soon could the United Kingdom mission be despatched?Lord Alexander confirmed that the United Kingdom mission would match theSouth African team in seniority. He hoped it could leave in the first week ofOctober. Its terms of reference* would, of course, include not only the simonstown question, but also the whole picture of R.N. organisation and facilities in South Africa and the South Atlantic. He would have to take Admiralty viewson this.Mr. Erasmus thanked United Kingdom Ministers for their courtesies during his visit. He hoped he could have a full record of these closing talks to take backto his Cabinet.Mr. Clark confirmed that this would be available on the following day. Anycorrection to the record, desired by United Kingdom Ministers or Mr. Erasmus,could be settled by telegraph.[* To be telegraphed later to Mr. Erasmus.]Commonwealth Relations Office,11th September, 1954.APPENDIX draft of Communique on Talks with Mr. Erasmus (not adopted)During the past two weeks Mr. F. C. Erasmus, Minister of Defence in theUnion of South Africa, accompanied by South African Service Chiefs and officials, has been on a visit to the United Kingdom. Mr. Erasmus and his advisers have taken this opportunity to renew contacts with the United kingdom authorities and to visit United Kingdom establishments and the Farnborough AirDisplay.2. Discussions with United Kingdom Ministers and Chiefs of Staff have enabled a full interchange of views and information. The talks have extended overthe whole field of co-operation, including the defence of the Middle East andSouth Africa&apos;s part in it, the equipment and supply of the South African forces and naval facilities in South Africa. In these talks strategic planning andco-operation have been greatly advanced and it was agreed to continue to work outcomprehensive plans in close collaboration and in conformity with the part that both Governments are determined to play in the interests of peace and thedefence of the free world.      ;
Annex BCOMBINED WORKING GROUPTerms of reference in furtherance of joint strategic plans for defence by sea, land and air, to workout a practical plan, for consideration by Governments, covering:(1) the combined use of Simonstown base by the Royal Navy and theSouth African Naval Forces in peace and in war, on the understanding thatthe base would also be available in war to the allies of the United Kingdom;(2) the eventual assumption of responsibility by the South African naval forces for the operation and administration of the base for combined use ifGovernments should subsequently agree in principle to this policy;(3) the assumption by the Union of South Africa of responsibility in war for operational and administrative control of a southern sub-area of a south atlantic strategic zone;(4) the continuation in peace of a Royal Naval Officer as Commander-in-Chief, South Atlantic, with headquarters and communications at the Cape,and his designation in war as Commander of a South Atlantic strategic zone.
