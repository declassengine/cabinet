secret.(54) 25223rd July, 1954REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON CIVIL, expenditure memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer at the meeting of the Cabinet on 20th July I promised to circulate, in consultation with the Commonwealth Secretary, a papershowing which recommendations of the Committee on Civil Expenditurerequired to be decided before the summer recess (C.C.(54) 51st Con-clusions, Minute 5).    I accordingly set out below a time-table which hasbeen agreed with the Commonwealth Secretary showing when decisions on the various recommendations are necessary.    But I am bound first to stress the desirability of the earliest possible decisions over thewhole field, not excluding those items which will only require actionwhen the Estimates for 1955/56 come to be prepared.    Until I knowapproximately the total of those recommendations which are accepted bythe Cabinet I cannot judge how far that total (taken together with savings on Defence) is adequate and how far further economies will be necessaryto enable me to present a sound Budget in 1955.    It is most important that any such further review should not be unduly hurried.2.   ,    I should like to have immediate authority in principle that,where items have already been agreed with the Ministers concerned,the Estimates for 1955/56 shall be framed on that basis and that thesame shall apply to the items not yet agreed as soon as agreement hasbeen reached.    This authority will cover all the items in paragraph 7of C. (54) 232 other than those specifically referred to below.3.        The following are approximately the latest times at which decisions must be taken on the other recommendations of theCommittee  - the references are to C. (54) 232:-(1) By end-July, 1954 - so that the necessary legislationcan be drafted in readiness for the Session 1954/55;Paragraph 8 (a)  -  Grants for rural water and sewerage&quot; 8 (b)  -  Temporary houses.(2) Paragraph 7(h) and (i) - Bread price and levy on flourLegislation would not, of course, be necessary merely to increase the retail price of bread in order to reduce thesubsidy; but it would be necessary for the introduction ofthe levy on flour.    If we are to reap the maximum benefit from the levy during 1955/56, the legislation must be passed at the earliest possible date next Session and should thereforeCOPY NOCABINET
be introduced immediately the Session opens.    Butthere is much to be done before that in agreeing thebasis of the scheme with the interests concerned andin drafting the legislation; so that there is little timeto be lost in deciding whether to go ahead with the levy proposal.    I am taking full account of theobjections raised.(3)  In the Autumn:Paragraph 7 (g)    -  Milk price.    Under present arrange-ments the 7d. price will run from 1st August, 1954, to 31st March, 1955,and there may be some publicexpectation that, as in recent years,there will then be some seasonalreduction.    A decision will thereforebe necessary whether the 7d. priceshould continue after the end of March.As the Committee suggest, we oughtto have some experience of the effectof the 7d. price on consumption and i therefore propose that we should takethe necessary decision in the lateAutumn.Paragraph 10Paragraph 12Paragraph 13Paragraph 15(4) In January, 1955;Paragraph 13- National Insurance and War Pensions(in time for an announcement inQueen&apos;s Speech).- Appeal for economy to LocalEducational Authorities.- Grants, etc. , to Malaya.Various works services.Grants, etc., to Kenya.(5) In February/March, 1955;Paragraph 7 (f)    -   Annual Review of agricultural support prices.4.       Since the last Cabinet discussion of this subject I have receiveda deputation from the Finance, Trade and Industry Committee of theParty, who drew attention to our election promises about economy andstressed the public interest in the matter.    I think that all who are con-cerned with the welfare of the British economy will agree with&quot;The Economist&quot; (of 3rd July, 1954) that:&quot;The miracle has happened - full employment without inflation, and this despite the heavy burdenof defence, the rising burden of the social services,and some reduction in taxation&quot;.
But &quot;the miracle&quot; must not be followed by disillusionment.    the forecasts for 1955/56, so far as we have got at present, do not show the margin necessary for further reliefs.    We must at any rate avoid the reverse process of increasing the burden of taxation.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.23rd July, 1954.
