C.(54) 2801st September, 1954.CABINETALTERNATIVES TO THE EUROPEAN DEFENCE community note by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for the consideration of my colleagues the annexed four draft telegrams of instruction to H.M. representatives at Bonn, Washington and Paris in the situation arising from the rejection of the European Defence Community (E.D.C.) Treaty bythe French Assembly.     These drafts may need some revision.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.1st September, 1954.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.* It is issued for the personal use of..TOP SECRET Copy No.. .2-3
PROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO BOMCypher/OTPFOREIGN OFFICE AND-WHITEHALL DISTRIBUTIONBMEDIATESECRETAddressed to BonnRepeated for information to WashingtonLuxembourgRomeU.K.Del, ParisTJ.IC.Del. LuxembourgParisBrusselsThe HagueFrench Assembly rejection of the E.D.G. makes it necessaryrapidly to find another way of ensuring German association withthe West.    The problem falls in two parts;(a) &apos; political, and (b) military.    On (a), plans have beenworked1out with the Americans and publicly announced for bringing the Bonn Conventions into force as soon as possible.M. Mendes-France has announced the French Government&apos;s intention,to proceed on these lines.    On (b), there is no similar agreedplan, but you will be aware from semi-official correspondence over recent months of the thought that has been given to this aspect of the problem in London.    In the view of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment it remains essential both to secure lasting Germanassociation with the West and to assure an effective defence ofthe West to obtain an early German defence contribution withinthe N.A.T.O.. framework.     It was made clear at the recent .Chartwell meeting that solutions must be found to these problemsvery soon in order to avoid the danger of a disillusioned Germanyslipping rapidly over towards a policy of neutralisation or even of a Soviet-German understanding.    At Chartwell and in his speeches during the recent E.D.C debate the French Prime minister has recognised these dangers and expressed his intention to work with France&apos;s Western allies for the restoration of Germansovereignty and German rearmament within the N.A.T.O. framework,although we must recognise that such a policy will probably meet with as great difficulties in France as the E.D.C.
- 2 -2.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government have considered the two majoralternative policies of German entry into H.A.T.O. with safe-guards upon German rearmament and of a looser non-supranationalEuropean defence community with United Kingdom participation.Their experience over the past three years leads them to fear that any attempt to work for the latter solution would lead tointerminable negotiation and fail to secure general agreement.The overriding need is for a rapid solution.    This can besthe reached on the basis of existing institutions and existingideas.    They have therefore decided to work for the first ofthese solutions, although they would be prepared to consider sympathetically any new practical proposals, likely to securegeneral approval, for a smaller and looser Europeangrouping aspart of JM.A.T.O. with German membership.    They have not them-selves been able to devise any workable plan on these lines.The safeguards which they would propose to accompany Germanentry into II.A.T.O.   are those in document 6 of the Report ofthe Anglo-American Study Group of.July 12.    They are mainlytaken from the E.D.C. and connected arrangements and are devised to appear as little discriminatory as possible against Germany.The admission of Germany into N.A.T.O. will require unanimousconsent of all its members and could only be achieved through a protocol to be agreed and ratified by each nationalParliament.    This can in our view only be obtained if suchE.S.G. safeguards are incorporated in the N.A.T,0. solution.3.     Her Majesty&apos;s Government have considered whether,given the exposed geographical position of the Federal republic and Berlin, a N.A.T.O. solution would be regarded as undulyprovocative by the Soviet Union.    While the E.D.C. solution would undoubtedly have been preferable, it is their consideredview that the Soviet Union v/ould not in practice make any greatdistinction between a German contribution to the N.A.T.O.defence effort through the E.T).C0 or direct.if..    Before however working out such a solution in detail with the United States and French Governments and with our other N.A.T.O. allies, it is essential.to know whether it wouldbe acceptable to Dr.. Adenauer and whether he. thinks that it wouldbe approved by the German Parliament.    You should therefore. \.; &apos; -       - i .  &apos;     &apos;,, /seek &apos;
.seek, an early opportunity to discuss the whole problem frankly .and in confidence with-him.    You should bear in mind that, the rejection of&quot;the E.D.C. must have teen a very hard personal&quot;blow- to Dr. Adenauer, who has attached the highest importanceto the ideal of Franco-German cooperation and Europeanintegration as the &quot;best safeguard against a revival of Germannationalism.    He will not, I fear, he enthusiastic over Germanentry into 1T.A.T.0. and will therefore &quot;be inclined to lookcritically at this juncture upon the suggested safeguards.    Femust therefore be careful to avoid provoking an.immediate hostile reaction while, he is in a mood of resentment and dejection.5.    Dr. Adenauer will however be expecting earlyconsultations on the problem of bringing toe Bonn Conventions intoforce.    While I recognise that wide sections of German opinionmay now regard the Bonn Conventions as unsatisfactory &quot;because theycontain restrictions on German sovereignty, I hope we need not take too seriously the preliminary German reactions discussed in mr. Johnston&apos;s telegrams Nos.      and        .    You should accordingly,in concert with your United States colleague, urge   uponDr. Adenauer the desirability of early action on the lines of theprotocols and connected letters prepared by the Anglo-AmericanStudy Group.    Detailed instructions on this are in my immediately following telegram..6.    Handling of the German defence contribution issue willbe even more delicate I think it would be preferable and more- conducive to subsequent international agreement if you make thefirst soundings without your United States colleague, and I havesuggested this to the United States Government.    While you should explain our ideas in general terms, as set out above, and leave Dr. Adenauer in no doubt that we do not think that there is any prospect of early agreement on the basis of unrestrictedGerman rearmament, you should not at this stage seek his agreement to the specific safeguards we have in mind nor put them to himexcept in the most general terms and then only if his initialreactions have been encouraging and he himself shows interest in them.-   Your general approach should be one of sympathy withdraw. Adenauer in the cruel and undeserved predicament now facing him;./four first
- K -Your first object should &quot;be to put heart into him and to persuade him that his friends abroad are determined to findin a short time a generally acceptable solution to the problemof German association with the TJest.    They are rolying upon his statesmanship and leadership to make this possible.    you should emphasise that, while we have plans prepared we must avoid producing cut-and-dried plans lacking the necessary public support in some of the countries concerned.    Our firstrequirement therefore is&apos; to know Dr, Adenauer?s own views andin particular what are the limits within which he considershe can now work with us to bring Germany into N&quot;,A.T.O. on thelines suggested above.7o    You should tell Dr. Adenauer that we are consultingM. Mendes-France simultaneously about the entry into forceof the Bonn Conventions but that we are awaitingDr. Adenauer&apos;s.views before consulting further withM. Mendes-France or any of our other allies on the alternatives to the E.D.C.    Tfe imagine Dr. Adenauer will agree on thenecessity to prepare a plan before embarking on a further international conference.    This should in&apos;our view take theform on an early meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the sixE.D.C. Powers plus the United Kingdom and the United States,to be followed by a meeting of the N.A.T.O. Council.

Treaty and if possible thisshould be done by agreement between the Four Powers which signedthose Conventions J&apos;     As the Prime Minister then stated, dis-cussion of the form of German rearmament other than through theE3DoC0 would entail the deferment of German rearmament for thetime being.    It would also be necessary to make provision for continued financial support for the Allied Forces in germany during the interim period pending agreement upon the form ofGerman rearmament.&apos; &apos; A similar statement was made in the UnitedStates.FROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO BONN

-3-that in the interests of speed it is essential not to reopen the substance of the Conventions.    Her Majesty&apos;s government agree that the Conventions are not perfect.    But if we were &apos;at this stage to embark upon their re-negotiation, very con-siderable delay could not be avoided,,     In the circumstances,the best course is surely to accept the Convert ions lock, stockand barrel, except, of course, insofar as there are references in them to the S.D.C.5.    Finally, you should explain to Dr. ,ldenauer, as statedin the London Study Group1s covering report, why there aretwo draft protocols and not one.

I hope they will agreethat the essential i?irs  step is to obtain the views of dr. Adenauer.      Our feeling had. been that it might cause lessspeculation if this were done by Sir F. Hoyer Millar, who would naturally be seeing the Chancellor on his return to Germany onSeptember 23    A joint demarche by the United Kingdom and UnitedStates High.:,Commissioners without the French High Commissionermight give rise to misunderstanding.    We have no desire k;however to move out of stop with the United States Governmentand are quite prepared for these soundings to be made by bothHigh Commissioners if the State Department prefer.    We thinkhowever that the High Commissioners should see Dr. Adenauerseparately.2.     If Dr. Adenauer proves receptive to our general line,we shall wish to discuss with him soon in more detail the questionof safeguards to accompany Germany&apos;s entry into N.A.T.O.    Weshould therefore welcome a very early expression of United Statesviews on the document communicated to them during the Anglo-American Study Group discussions in London in July.

You should explain that Dr. Adenauer is being approached simultaneously.You should hand M. Mendes-France the draft protocols andexchanges of notes with a prefatory explanation on the linesof paragraphs 1 and 2 of my telegram under reference.    you should also refer to M. Mendes-France1s own statement in theAssembly that Germany must be given back her sovereignty andthat he is prepared to bring the Bonn Conventions into force as soon as possible and, if necessary, to bring the FrenchParliament back from its holiday in order to do so.2.    M. Mendes-France&apos;s statement is in line withAnglo-American policy and to that extent welcome. .   But heshould not be allowed to suppose that the Federal Governmentwill give this approach an unreserved welcome.     Indeed thereis every reason to expect that Adenauer may argue that theBonn Conventions impose so many servitudes upon Germany thatthe Bundestag may no longer approve them, when divorced fromthe advantages, of the E.D.C. Treaty.
