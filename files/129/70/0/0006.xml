(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT)secret.(54) 25626th July, 1954.CABINETABOLITION OF VISAS FOR GERMANAND AUSTRIAN NATIONALSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department and Minister for Welsh AffairsThe Foreign Secretary has asked me to agree to the abolition ofvisas for Germans and Austrians coming to the United Kingdom.     TheSecurity Service see strong objection to this, and I feel bound to submit the matter for the consideration of my colleagues.2. Since the war substantial progress has been made in theabolition of visas in Western Europe, but for obvious reasons the visarequirement for German nationals has been retained by most western european states until very recently.    In April last year the german federal Republic decided unilaterally to abolish visas for visitors toGermany who were nationals of member states of the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation and the Council of Europe.    It wasdecided that the United Kingdom could not grant a reciprocal concession,but, in order to go as far as possible in the direction of reciprocity, it wasagreed that United Kingdom visas should be issued without charge to german nationals and that holders of German ministerial, diplomatic and service passports need not obtain visas to enter or pass through theUnited Kingdom.    At that time other Western European states were alsounwilling to abolish visas for Germans, but they have since decided one by one to do so.    France not long ago decided to follow the example of the others, and now the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic (which followsus in this matter) are the only member states of the Council of Europe whostill require German visitors to obtain visas.COPY NO.3. The Foreign Secretary has represented strongly -(i)     that, as a matter of general policy, it is undesirable thatthe United Kingdom should appear to be lagging behindother European countries in freeing travel in Europe,particularly since this is a matter in which considerable interest has been shown by both the Council of europe and the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation)(ii)    that it is of great importance, particularly at the presenttime, that every possible step should be taken to ensurethat Germany is brought within the Western family ofnations and that we should not appear to be the onlyWestern European country discriminating againstnationals of the Federal Republic in a matter of thiskind j
22-(iii)    that it is not easy to justify to the Germans this apparentdiscrimination against them when they know that nationals of France and Italy, where there are substantial numbersof Communists, do not require United Kingdom visas.4, The Board of Trade have also represented that, in the interestsof the tourist trade, the abolition of visas for Germans would be a usefulstep,5, The abolition of visas does not in itself involve any alteration in the immigration control exercised at the ports.    Although control iseasier when there is a prior examination before the foreigner starts onhis journey, I should not wish to press objection for the sake of immigration control in the face of the political considerations urged by the foreign secretary and, but for the security objection, I should before this haveagreed to his suggestion.    The Security Service have represented, however,that in view of the slender control between Eastern Germany and theFederal Republic, the abolition of visas from the latter is tantamount to theabolition of visas for nationals of a Russian satellite country.    The federal government will issue a passport to any refugee from the Russian Zonewho can show that he is a German, and the examination by Visa Officers inGermany provides the best, and indeed the only, practical and effective means of establishing the recent history of applicants.    This means that,in the view of the Security Service, if visas were no longer required, thetask of the Russian Intelligence Service in recruiting German spies in Eastor West Germany and passing them on to the United Kingdom would be madeeasier and the task of detecting them correspondingly more difficult.    TheSecurity Service also attach importance to the help which Visa Officerscould give in the building up of the efficiency of the German Security Service,6. The Foreign Secretary recognises that there is some risk of federal passports being issued to undesirables, but feels that spies trained in East Germany are less likely to be directed against the United Kingdomthan against United Kingdom forces and installations in West Germany,which is a risk which we already have to accept, and that the political considerations involved outweigh the security objections.7. We treat Austria similarly and whatever decision is reachedabout Germans should apply also to Austrians.8. There is undoubtedly force in the Security Service objections,and there are also some political objections to the proposed abolition,since the absence of a preliminary examination in Germany would makeit easier for persons prominently connected with Nazi Germany or theneo-Nazi movement to come to the United Kingdom without an opportunityfor their cases to be considered before they arrive at a United Kingdomport.    My colleagues may feel, however, that these objections are out-weighed by the general political considerations to which the foreign secretary has drawn attention, and that we should accordingly accept therisk involved.9. If this is agreed, I should propose to proceed on a basis of complete reciprocity with the Germans and to limit abolition to visasfor visitors coming for less than three months.    There would be sometechnical difficulties in limited abolition of this kind (which would be a
23new step for the United Kingdom) but it would have the advantage that Germanscoming here for longer periods (e.g. with labour permits) would stillrequire visas and could be checked in Germany before they come here.    Itshould not take long to work out a practical scheme for such a modifiedabolition, but the important thing would be to authorise the immediateopening of ne negotiations with the Federal Republic.D.M.F.Home Office, S.W.1.24th July, 1954.
