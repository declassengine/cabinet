his document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;S governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.  August 1954SECRET Copy No.C. (54) 27220th August, 1954CABINETCOST OF LIVINGMemorandum by the Prime minister draw my colleagues&apos; attention to the attached Report which I have obtainedfrom the Ministry of Labour and National Service who deal with the Price Index.I am enquiring:  (a) What forecasts of this development were given by the Ministry of Food.(b) What estimates were made by the Economic Policy Committee.(c) Whether any warning was given beforehand by any of the Authoritiesinvolved to Lord Swinton&apos;s Propaganda Committee.2. The subject must be considered by the Cabinet at its next meeting. I had contemplated Monday, the 30th, for this. It may be, however, that foreign affairs will require Mr. Eden&apos;s return at an earlier date, and my colleagues should considerthat Thursday, the 26th, may be involved.w. s. c.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,20th August, 1954.
Retail Prices Index, 13th July, 19541. The published index figure is 145, showing a rise of 3 points comparedwith the figure at 15th June. To one decimal the rise was 2-4 points (from 142-in June to 144-6 in July). This rise of 2-4 points on 142-2 is equivalent to a rise of 1-7 per cent.The rise in the index was almost entirely due to higher food prices. For thefood group, as a whole, prices at 13th July were about 4 per cent, higher thanat 15th June.The chief factors contributing to the rise of 2-4 points in the all itemsfigure were:  Meat. Beef prices rose by 14 to 15 per cent.; mutton and lamb by nearly14 per cent.; pork by 11 to 12 per cent.; bacon and ham by nearly 3 percent. The increases for meat and bacon raised the all items figure byabout 1 -.1 points.Eggs. Prices rose by about 40 per cent., and this raised the all items figureby about 0-8 points.Fruit (mainly cooking apples). The prices of cooking apples rose by nearly20 per cent. This together with small changes for other fruit raised theall items figure by about 0-5 points.Other food. There were increases for potatoes and cabbage but these wereoffset by lower prices for tomatoes and there was little net effect.2. The next index date is 17th August and it is impossible at present to predict the level of the index for that date. A sample of returns of meat prices at 3rd and 10th August indicated that between 13th July and 10th August therewas no evidence of any tendency for meat prices to fall and it might therefore be unwise to count on any fall by 17th August. - Similarly, evidence regarding the wholesale prices of eggs does not suggest that prices of eggs are likely to show a fall in August.There is usually a sharp fall in the prices of potatoes and of cooking applesin August, but on the other hand there was a seasonal advance of Id. a pint inthe price of milk at 1st August.There may be other price changes in August, but there is no present evidenceof any change likely to have a marked effect on the index. All that can be said atpresent is that the final figure being close to the half-way line in July might dropbelow this line in August, giving an index figure of .144. There seems little likelihood of a drop of more than one point.Later in the year the index will be affected by rent increases following thepassing of the Housing Repairs and Rents Acts.. It is understood that a rise inthe price of bread is under consideration and any such rise would, of course, tendto push the index higher.3. The retail prices index is computed on the basis of actual prices being charged on one selected day in each month and does not therefore represent theaverage position over a complete month. The selected day is normally the Tuesdaynearest the 15th of the month.So far as is known, 13th July was not abnormal in that prices on that daywere untypical.
