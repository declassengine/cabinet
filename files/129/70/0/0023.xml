Go(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(54) 273 COPY NO.24th August, 1954.CABINETAPPOINTMENT OF AGRICULTURAL LAND TRIBUNALSMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and FisheriesConsiderable publicity has been given in the press recently toa ruling of the High Court in the case of Woollett v. Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries which concerned a proposal for the compulsory purchase ofthree acres of land belonging to a Mrs. Woollett.The decision was adverse to my Department on the gi-ound thatthe Agricultural Land Tribunal which dismissed an appeal by Mrs. Woollettand approved the proposed purchase had not been properly constituted.If the judgement stands it throws doubt on the constitution, and therefore onthe decisions, of the majority of Agric cultural Land Tribunals which in thelast six years, have dealt with many hundreds of cases under the agriculture Act, 1947, - not only compulsory purchases, but notices toquit farms, dispossession for bad husbandry, and certain other cases.2. Having consulted the Law Officers I am satisfied, for thereasons given in detail in the appendix, that I cannot leave the position asit is.Possible courses are:-(i)  To appeal.    If successful on all points this wouldsolve the difficulties.    If unsuccessful or only partially successful it would afford grounds for asking for a Bill to validate the proceedings ofAgricultural Land Tribunals upon which doubt hasbeen cast.(ii)  Not to appeal, but to proceed at once with avalidating Bill.3. The Law Officers advise that there are grounds for appeal.But it is doubtful whether we shall succeed on all points, and we shall notnecessarily avoid the need for a Bill to validate the appointments and proceedings of the many other Tribunals that have been appointed in thesame way as the one which heard the case of Mrs. Woollett.    Nevertheless,I consider that the right course is to appeal, and subject to the agreementof my colleagues, that is what I propose to do.    If we lose, or are only partially successful, we shall be no worse off than we are now, and indeed the arguments for having a validating Bill may be stronger.
G4. In order to avoid hardship to Mrs. Woollett, I intend, withthe agreement of the Treasury, to offer to pay her reasonable costswhatever the result of the appeal.D.H.A.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries,S.W.I.,24th August, 1954.APPENDIXWoollett v. Minister of Agriculture and fisheries. Section 85 of the Agriculture Act, 1947, confers on the Ministerpowers of compulsory acquisition of land of which he is in possession under emergency powers.    The purpose of the power is to secure or maintainthe full and efficient use of the land for agriculture.2.i Mrs. Woollett is the owner of 3 acres of land, part of an areaof about 300 acres which was requisitioned by the Department in 1940/41 inorder to bring it into agricultural production and is for the most part still held under requisition.    Mrs. Woollett bought the land in 1947 when it wasunder requisition.3. This area consisted of building plots the majority of which were unlikely to be developed, and, so as to keep the area in agricultural production former Ministers authorised the necessary steps for itscompulsory purchase.    Mrs. Woollett exercised her right to require theproposal for purchase to be referred to an Agricultural Land tribunal which, however, decided that the Department should proceed with its proposalto acquire the land in the interests of its full and efficient use for agriculture.The necessary Certificate under section 85 (which is equivalentto a Compulsory Purchase Order) was therefore given.4. An Agricultural Land Tribunal consists of a legally qualifiedChairman appointed by the Lord Chancellor, and two other members appointed by the Minister.    For the latter the choice is limited to persons whose names are on panels of persons nominated for the purpose by representatives of farmers and of landowners.5. Two years after the Tribunal had given its decisionMrs. Woollett applied to the High Court for a declaration that the certificate under section 85 was invalid on three grounds.    These were not concerned with the agricultural merits of the proposed purchase but solelywith alleged defects in the procedure.    Two of these allegations failedbefore the Judge, but the main allegation, namely, that the Tribunal whichheard Mrs. Woolletfs case had not been properly constituted, succeeded,since the Judge held that the two lay members of the Tribunal had not been properly appointed by or on behalf of the Minister.    They had been appointedfrom the nominated panels by the Secretary of the Tribunal but, the Judgeheld, in his capacity as Secretary and not as an officer of the Minister.
02-6. It was argued on behalf of the Department that objection couldnot now be taken to the constitution of the Tribunal because -(i) the Agriculture Act, 1947, provides that acts of a Tribunal are valid notwithstandingsubsequent discovery of a defect in theappointment of a member;  and(ii) the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure)Act, 1946, provides a period of limitation after which a Compulsory Purchase Order or thecorresponding Certificate under the agriculture act, cannot be challenged in the Courts on theground of defective procedure.But the Judge decided against both points, the first on the ground that thedefect was such that there had never been an appointment of the Tribunalat all, and the second on the ground that if the prerequisite of a hearingbefore a properly constituted Tribunal was absent, there never had beena Certificate to challenge.7. From this it followed that the decision of the Tribunal andthe Certificate for purchase given in conformity with that decision were void.8. If this decision affected only the purchase of Mrs. Woolletfsland it would still be of some general importance because of the Judge&apos;view on the two points set out in paragraph 6.    Other Departments areconcerned at the decision on the second point under the Acquisition of Land(Authorisation Procedure) Act, 1946.But the decision is of the greatest possible importance tothe Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries because of the doubt it throws onthe constitution and decisions of all Tribunals which have sat since 1947.The Department has already received a number of enquiries from persons affected by such decisions, and in some cases legal proceedings are alreadythreatened.9. References to Agricultural Land Tribunals may be required bythe parties concerned not only on the Departments proposals for compulsory purchase, but also on its proposals to dispossess farmersbecause of bad husbandry, or to serve directions on landowners to providefixed equipment, and on its decisions to give or withhold consent to theoperation of notices to quit given by landlords to tenants and objected to bythe latter.In all such cases which have been referred to Tribunals, theparties affected are left by the decision in doubt as to their position.Where land has been purchased under compulsory powers thelate owner may seek to re-open the transaction.    Where purchases arestill in process and notices to treat have been served, some owners may wishto withdraw while others may hold the Minister to the purchase.    Thiswould raise extremely awkward administrative problems where the proposals is to acquire the whole of an area which is owned in small plots by a numberof individuals.Dispossessed farmers and tenants who have quitted under noticeare likely to seek to recover possession of their farms or to start pro-ceedings against the Department to recover damages.
Novel and difficult points of law are involved, and it is already-clear that persons affected and their advisers are becoming aware of theposition.10. For these reasons and because other Departments are to someextent affected, it may be that the right course is to appeal.The most likely ground for succeeding on the appeal is thatMrs. Woolletfs application to the High Court was out of time - (seeparagraph 6(ii) above).    If the appeal succeeded on that ground alone itwould settle all doubts about compulsory purchase (because the time limitonly applies in such cases), but the doubt would remain about all otherkinds of cases considered by Agricultural Land Tribunals and a validatingBill would still be necessary to deal with these.
