confidential.(54) 294 COPY NO.   *j21st September, 1954CABINETROMAN TEMPLE IN THE CITY OF london memorandum by the Minister of works the Ministry of Works has made grants of  12,300 over the last six years to the Roman and Medieval London Excavation Council to help them dig for Roman remains on bombed sites.2.        The Council has discovered the foundations of a Temple ofMithras dating from 150 A.D. on the Bucklersbury House site, Walbrook.The building owner and contractors have co-operated with thearchaeologists, but the time has come when further delay in preparing the site will cause them considerable financial loss.    The ruin is nothing much to see and none of the archaeologists I met on the sitesuggested we should stop the new building altogether in order to preserve the foundations permanently.    It is however important to carry the workto the point where the ground plan of the Temple can be fully plotted andrecorded.    This will take a week or two more digging and I arranged with the owners and contractors to agree to this in spite of the loss and delay involved.    Everyone seemed satisfied with the proposal.3.        I do not recommend any action to preserve the remains of theTemple.    There are likely to be other finds as the rebuilding of theCity proceeds, and I shall continue to give the Excavation Council all thesupport which is possible within the limits of the Ancient Monuments&apos;Vote.D.E.Ministry of Works, S.E.1.20th September, 1954.
