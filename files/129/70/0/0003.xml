[(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL- /C.(54) 253 COPY NO.j*24th July, 1954CABINETGIBRALTAR:  COST-OF-LIVING allowances for INDUSTRIAL WORKERSNote by the Minister of Labour and National service at the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion, I am circulating the text of a Minute which I addressed to the Prime Minister on 21st July on cost^of-living allowances for industrial workers in Gibraltar.W.M.Ministry of Labour and National Service,S.W.I.23rd July, 1954.PRIME MINISTERGostTofrLiving Allowances for Industrial Workersin GibraltarAt its meeting on 28th April, 1954, the Cabinet considered thequestion of the remuneration paid by the Service Departments to theSpanish workers employed by them in Gibraltar having regard to theexisting discrimination under which, in addition to a basic wage of4l/6d. , Spaniards receive only 50 per cent of the cosi-of-livingallowanceof 48/-d. weekly which is paid to Gibraltarians irrespective of whetherthe workers concerned reside in Gibraltar or Spain.    The Cabinet agreedthat, subject to further enquiry, some change in this discriminationshould be made and I undertook to consider and recommend to you theform such enquiry should take.    Some information on the present positionis given in the Annex.2.        I arranged a meeting on 24th May with the Ministers concernedwith this problem in order to ascertain whether any of the facts needed for a decision were in dispute and, if so, what further enquiry might benecessary to establish them.
(l)To pay the same rate of wages and cost-of-livingallowances to Gibraltarians and Spanishworkers alike.This is the policy recommended by the Governmentof Gibraltar with the support of the City Counciland, as reported by the Governor General, isfollowed generally by private employers.    It isbased on the principle of the rate for the job,without differentiation as regards nationality ordomicile, which is generally recognised in determining the pay of foreign workers in othercountries.    It hag the advantage of providing apermament solution and, moreover, appears to bethe only way of removing the discrimination bynationality among workers residing in Spain.The arguments against it are in effect those statedin favour of the alternative in (2) below, togetherwith the consideration that it would involve greateradditional wages coststo the Service Departmentsthan that alternative.No further enquiry is needed if this solution is to beadopted.This is the course favoured by the Colonial Officeand the Foreign Office and by myself.(2) To assess the cost-of-living allowance payable to spanish workers (apart from those living in gibraltar, who would receive the allowance paidto Gibraltarian workers) on the basis of the comparative cost of living in Spain.This solution takes for its basis the results of enquiries already made into the prices, both in gibraltar and in the neighbouring Spanish territory,of articles normally forming part of the familybudgets of Gibraltarians.    According to these enquiries comparable figures of monthly budgetsare approximately the same but, if account istaken of the possibility that Spanish workers wouldpurchase some articles in Gibraltar when pricesthere are cheaper, those living on the Spanish sideof the frontier may spend less by  3 out of a totalbudget of  25, or 12 per cent.    The comparisonignores the travelling costs of Spanish workers whichlargely offset this difference.    The weight to begiven to the cost of travelling and rents is not easy to assess.    Because of this the Colonial Officefeel it is not possible to maintain that there is a significant difference between cost of living in spain and in Gibraltar but the Service Departmentstake a contrary view.This is the solution favoured by the Air Ministry, the WarOffice and the Treasury.    The view of the Admiralty isthat no case has been made out for any increase in the allowance because of the lower wage rates prevailing in Spain,
The arguments against this course, apart from the objection in principle, are that it leaves a grievancefor continued exploitation by the Spanish trade union or the Spanish Government and that it has the dis-advantage of providing no permanent solution but would necessitate adjustments corresponding to changes in the cost of living.    Further, the costof living may well rise in Spain owing to increases in wage rates and American competition for labourand the possibility that it may exceed that in gibraltar cannot be excluded.    Although suchdevelopments could be dealt with as they arise thepolitical advantages of removing discriminationnow would be lost.No further enquiry is necessary in order to establish the facts on which a decision to adopt this solutioncould be based.(3) To reach some compromise between the other two solutions.This solution would mean a smaller cost-c **livmgdifferential between Gibraltarian and Spanish workersbut would retain a discrimination based on nationality and domicile.    It is difficult to see, however, on whatlogical basis this solution could be justified nor is itapparent that such a basis could be established by further enquiry.As the Admiralty take the view that no increase in the allowance is warranted, they regard the solutionproposed in paragraph 3(2) as a compromise initself.4.        The Treasury have put forward the view that the higher costof living in Gibraltar is to some extent due to the improper discriminatoryexchange rates imposed on foodstuffs imported from Spain into gibraltar and that in consequence we should be paying twice over by increasing the allowance to Spaniards.    Against this I think it might be pointed out thaton foodstuffs alone the enquiry into prices showed a higher cost of livingfor the workers concerned who reside in Spain.5.        My conclusion is that the question whether Spaniards working in Gibraltar should be paid on the basis of the rate for the job or on somedifferential basis is a matter of principle to be decided by the cabinet and that the information already available is sufficient in order to enable a decision to be taken on one of the alternatives indicated above.(Signed) WALTER MONCKTON21st July, 1954.
