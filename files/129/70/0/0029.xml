SECRET Copy No.     (C. (54) 27931st August, 1954CABINETTRANSFER OF THE HIGH COMMISSION territories memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations my colleagues will remember that we sent Dr. Malan a detailed statement ofour attitude on this question recently in answer to the contentions in his memorandum of 8th June. The communication annexed to C. (54) 223, withthe amendment approved in Cabinet on 13th July (C.C. (54) 50th Conclusions,Minute 5) was made on 21st July.2. A further Memorandum dated 7th August has now been received fromthe Union Government (Annex I). Our High Commissioner has reported that the text was drafted by Dr. Malan himself and was not discussed in Cabinet or seen by other Ministers.3. This latest Memorandum, while reiterating the contentions contained inthe earlier Memorandum, adds a new and somewhat mischievous one. In the last paragraph the United Kingdom Government are accused of using transfer as alever to influence Union policy on the franchise for Natives. This appears to bebased on the account contained in paragraph 8 of the South African White paper of the negotiations leading up to the South Africa Act of 1909 betweenrepresentative South Africans and the Imperial Government.  (Annex II.)4. Though the issues were at that time regarded as inter-related, I can findno evidence that, in all the subsequent discussions and statements on transfer, thequestion of Native franchise has ever been even referred to in that context. It isdifficult to see what Dr. Malan hopes to gain by now imputing such a motive to us.He may be striving to find some argument, however far-fetched, not alreadydemolished by our recent Memorandum; or he may be hoping to push us intoa disclaimer of any interest in the Native franchise, and to make Party capital of this at home.5. Whatever his purpose, I think we must try to avoid being drawn into freshcontroversy. I do not think we can rest on a better statement of our position thanthat contained in our recent Memorandum. I think it would therefore be wisenot to send any reply to Dr. Malan&apos;s latest communication. If he should make public reference to his new contention that we are using the transfer issue to force the Union Government^ hand on franchise, we could produce a convincing denial.But unless some public mention of this point is made I propose to ignore it.6. Neither transfer nor the coloured vote played any significant part in therecent provincial elections which resulted in the National Party increasing itsmajority in the Transvaal and Orange Free State, and gaining control from theUnited Party in the Cape Province. This reinforces my view that we should try to let these present exchanges with, the Union Government come to an end.SWINTON.Commonwealth Relations Office,Downing Street, S.W.1,30th August, 1954.- 4675.printed for the Cabinet.  September 1954
ANNEX IMEMORANDUMTheU nion Government wish to make the following comments on the message of the 11th June to the Prime Minister of the Union from the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth Relations and on the points raised in the United kingdom governments memorandum, dated 21st July, 1954, on the subject of the high commission Territories:  1. In general, the contents of the above-mentioned documents would appearto be a repetition of standpoints and arguments which have been adopted and usedfor many years and which have already been thrashed out thoroughly on bothsides. They do not contain anything not already embodied in the documentsrecently published, and it cannot be said, therefore, that the matter has been takenany further.2. The description in the memorandum of the origin of the South Africa Actand Section 151 thereof is one-sided and incomplete. It should be rememberedthat, before Union, the four South African territories were Colonies subject toBritish sovereignty; that the United Kingdom Government, through its HighCommissioner for South Africa, was kept in touch with the discussions in theNational Convention on the draft Bill; and that pressure was exerted by the factthat, unless certain conditions were satisfied, it would not have been possible forthe United Kingdom Parliament to approve the unification of the four Colonies.In the framing of Section 151, the United Kingdom Government had a share as great as that of the National Convention.3. The Union Government have never contended that Section 151, as it stands,imposes an obligation on the United Kingdom to transfer. But the acknowlegement-ment that it has a meaning and intention surely implies a moral obligation to explore every means of reaching the end in view. Up to the present, there hasbeen no sign whatever of any such attitude on the part of the United KingdomGovernment.4. The question whether consultation with the Natives postulated consent or&quot; full acquiescence &quot; on their part has been discussed and, in the opinion of theUnion Government, brought to finality; all the necessary particulars are containedin the White Paper published in the Union, and it is therefore unnecessary to revert to it again. The Union Government have fully acknowledged that the Nativesshould be adequately informed of their policy in the event of transfer; so muchso that prior to 1939 the necessary documents to this end were prepared inconsultation with the United Kingdom Government. General Hertzog, however,justifiably, complained that the United Kingdom Government, in spite of theiracknowledgment that Section 151 had a meaning and intention, had failed to foster an attitude of goodwill among the natives towards the idea of transfer, andthat, in fact, they had not been co-operative an attitude which would now appearto be borne out by their memorandum under reply.5. The United Kingdom Government repudiate any suggestion that agreement was reached in 1939 to transfer the territories and assert that the UnionGovernment have read, too much into the negotiations conducted at that time.The fact of the matter is, however, that the Union Government have nevercategorically affirmed that such an agreement had actually been reached in 1939.It is true that no decision to transfer the Territories was at that time taken; butto contend, as the United Kingdom Government now do, that there was no agreement whatever is to ignore facts, and very important facts, too.The real position is that the United Kingdom Government, realising theirobligation to remain loyal to their acknowledgment that Section 151 had a meaningand intention, did in fact come to an agreement with the Union Governmentconcerning the steps to be taken jointly by the two Governments towards transfer;that the necessary documents were actually prepared and approved by both governments; and that publication thereof was perforce prevented by theoutbreak of the war and not, as now suggested in the United KingdomGovernment^ memorandum, because of an entirely voluntary agreement on bothsides.The foregoing would seem to indicate that the United Kingdom Governmenthad gone a long way towards implementing the obligations which arise from theiracknowledgment that Section 151 has a meaning and intention; now, however,
they deliberately repudiate the steps that were taken or agreed to prior to theoutbreak of the war in 1939.6. The Union Government must take the most serious exception to theassertion in the last section of the United Kingdom Governments memorandum that the native inhabitants of the Territories would definitely oppose transfer forthe reason that they could not willingly accept the Unioris native policy. It cansurely not have been the intention to suggest that the rights of the Natives in the territories would be endangered, since the Union Government have undertaken to administer the Territories strictly in accordance with the terms and conditionsembodied in the Schedule to the South Africa Act. Moreover, their policy is clearly in favour of the reserve system, and this to such a degree that millions have been spent on the purchase of additional land from the Europeans for the Union&apos;s ownnative population.The Union Government do not wish to assume that the United KingdomGovernment have used the foregoing argument in order to provide the nativeinhabitants of the Territories with a reason for resistance to transfer of whichthey themselves have possibly never been conscious. In view of the good relationsbetween the two Governments concerned, which neither of them would wish to disturb, such a supposition would naturally be unthinkable.The Union Government would prefer to regard the United kingdom governments assertion as an echo, at this late stage, of the reason why the territories were not transferred when Union was constituted, despite theacknowledgment, by implication, that they rightly belong to the Union and thattheir future lies there. That reason was that the United Kingdom Governmentswish that the franchise, as it existed at that time in the Cape Colony, should beextended also to the Natives of the three northern Provinces, on an equal footing with the Europeans, was not realised. The delay for nearly half a century since then and up to the present time must, in the circumstances, give rise to the thoughtthat the United Kingdom Government have always regarded transfer as a leverwhich could still serve as a means of accomplishing their original purpose.If this is correct and the Union Government sincerely hope that it is not the harmful consequences for the United Kingdom as well as for the Union could easily be imagined.After the foregoing frank but well-intentioned analysis of the United kingdom governments memorandum, the Union Government regret that they have no alternative but to conclude that their reply of the 8th June, 1954, to the UnitedKingdom Government, must remain unaltered.Pretoria, 7th August, 1954.ANNEX IIEXTRACT FROM THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT white paper ON THE NEGOTIATIONS REGARDING THE transfer to THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA OF THE GOVERNMENTOF BASUTOLAND, BECHUANALAND PROTECTORATE ANDSWAZILANDTreaty of Vereeniging and the National Convention8. &quot; Clause 8 of the Treaty provides that the question of granting franchisesto natives will not be decided until after the introduction of self-government.When in the 1906 Constitution the Transvaal refused to give any political rights to natives, the British Government laid down that &apos; pending any grant of representation to natives .... no native territory now administered by theGovernor High Commissioner will be placed under the control of any responsible government.&apos; Swaziland was therefore transferred at this time to the HighCommissioner.The interdependence of the two issues was thus already clear, and it wasmade still clearer to the Convention of leading South Africans which was called to discuss Union by its chairman, Sir Henry (afterwards Lord) de Villiers. Havingrecently visited England, he announced that the Imperial Government wished togive the delegates a free hand in everything but the native franchise and theProtectorates, since &apos; it regarded itself in a special sense as a guardian and trustee
of the natives of South Africa.&apos; He warned them that if the &apos; settlement of the franchise question was regarded as unsatisfactory, then the Protectorates wouldnot be handed over.&apos; Sir Edgar Walton, himself a delegate, wrote that theConvention was made to realise early in its sittings that if the Protectorates wereto be included &apos; then the native people must find in the Constitution such provisionfor their protection and for their interests that they would be induced of theirown free will to be included in the new State about to be created.&apos; (VideAnnexure 2.)The other provinces, however, rejected the Cape Franchise, and even anylimited form of it, and persuaded the Cape to abolish the rights of its colouredand native citizens to sit in Parliament. The Cape representatives, and especiallyColonel Stanford and Mr. Sauer, put up a great fight for the extension of theirliberal traditions, but succeeded only in entrenching their own franchise behinda two-thirds majority of both Houses.The Protectorates question was treated in a clause permitting transfer atsome future, unknown date in the same terms, be it noted, as applied to rhodesia,* and in a Schedule containing safeguards which should operate in that event, the Convention being more interested in the permission, and the BritishGovernment in the safeguards. These consisted of guarantees to the nativesregarding their lands, their tribal institutions, and the liquor traffic; in a form ofadministration by a Commission under the control of the Governor-General inCouncil, and in the reservation to the Crown of any legislation affecting theSchedule. These last conditions were strongly contested by some of the delegates,and it was necessary at last for the High Commissioner, Lord Selborne, who hadstrong instructions from home and also the difficult task of reassuring the uneasytribes, to write a very frank letter to the chairman:  &apos; The obligations of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the tribes inhabitingBasutoland and the Bechuanaland Protectorate are obligations of honour ofthe greatest possible weight. These tribes surrendered themselves under thedominion of Queen Victoria of their own free will and they have been loyalsubjects ... ever since. The history of the connection with Swaziland is different but the obligations are only different in degree.&apos;In a final and even stronger letter he declared:  &apos; It is no question of policy we are discussing: it is a question of honour and one to which every section of public opinion in the United Kingdom,Government and Opposition alike, is keenly sensitive.&apos;The compromise at last achieved, a delegation brought the Bill to Englandand heard it debated in Parliament. Speakers on both sides openly regretted the exclusion of natives outside the Cape from any political rights, but few felt thatit would be either practical or justifiable to endanger union on this issue. TheGovernment assured the House that it could regard the Cape Franchise asabsolutely secure; it was impossible &quot; to find a single instance when a great bodyof persons like this, a whole race, has been disfranchised in democratic times,&apos; andthere was a general expectation that the Cape tradition would in time leaven thewhole Union. On the Protectorates issue the Government were pressed hard.Their spokesman, Colonel Seely, interpreted the Schedule as purely permissive.&apos; It does not bring transfer an hour nearer. In fact .... it makes it more difficult.&apos;He emphasises the strength of the administrative safeguards. &apos; Under its terms,transfer, should it come .... may well be hardly perceivable to the nativesthemselves&apos;....&apos;! can assure the House that the wishes of the natives in the territories will be most carefully considered before any transfer takes place.&apos;Put thus in its contemporary context, the Schedule appears not as a promise butas a permission, and one dependent upon conditions and safeguards.&quot;!There is reproduced as Annexure 3 the text of a letter dated 3rd February, 1909,from Sir Henry de Villiers, President of the National Convention to the Earl ofSelborne, in which reference is made to the understanding on which the Scheduleto the Act of Union was drawn up and as Annexure 4 the text of extracts fromministerial speeches made during the passage of the South Africa Act through the.United Kingdom Parliament in July-August, 1909. J* This is not so. Section 150 of the South Africa Act provides that &quot; the King . . . may . . .admit into the Union the territories administered by the British South Africa Company.&quot; Section151 provides that &quot;The King . . . may . . . transfer to the Union the government of&quot; the territories later known as the High Commission Territories.f Pages 12-14 of the Protectorates of South Africa, by Perham &amp; Curtis.% These papers have been made available by the courtesy of :the United Kingdom Government.
