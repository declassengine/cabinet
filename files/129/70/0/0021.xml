(54) 27118th August, 1954CABINETANGLO RUSSIAN relations note by the Prime minister as my colleagues have been following so closely the discussions about aTpp-Level Meeting with Russia, I circulate the following record of a conversation between Sir Frank Roberts and the First Secretary of the Soviet Embassy.2. In my correspondence with the President I made it clear that my object was to make a Three- or Four-Power Meeting in London possible and for this a gesture would be required from the Russians either on Austria, or on Eisenhower&apos;industrial Atomic proposal. Even then I made it clear that I could not commit the President to accepting the plan. The prospect to the Kremlin was certainlybleak. Their refusal, on the other hand, to come half-way to meet on neutralterritory on the conditions I outlined on May 11, 1953 would have put us in astrong position in Parliament, and would have freed us from any complaint of notacting in harmony with the unanimous House of Commons&apos; resolution of last session. Certainly we should be better situated both at home and abroad eitherif they had refused, or if an announcement of a Conference had been made, than we are now. The Attlee-Bevan Moscow excursion and Malenkov contacts maynot have done any serious international harm, but while avoiding all solid and serious issues it has given them a vague, sloppy initiative in the direction of peace,which may not be without its Electoral reactions.
3. We had however no choice in view of our loyalty to the european defence Community (E.D.C.). We must do our best to get this through. speed and decision are far more important to us than changes in the form of the Treatyprovided that they do not paralyse the whole project. Its real value is the factthat it brings a German Army in a strictly regulated form into the North atlantic treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) front and under General Gruenther&apos;s command.E.D.C. also commands the support of our official Opposition who would probably not commit themselves to other methods. But it was N.A.T.O. not E.D.C. thatwould ever have done any fighting.4. I am very glad that M. Mendes-France, whom I have been anxious tomeet, has himself proposed to come to Chartwell on Monday on his way back from Brussels.  I will keep my colleagues informed.5. We are actively supporting the Americans on E.D.C. If it fails orevaporates in indefinite delays, a great effort must be made to achieve the sameresults through a recasting of N.A.T.O. The danger which I fear the most isMr. Dulles&apos;s &quot; agonised reappraisal.&quot; Peripheral defence may well be doom-laden. Its possibility is not receding.W.S.C.10 Downing Street, S.W.1,17th August, 1954.
iCONVERSATION  BETWEEN  SIR  FRANK  ROBERTS  AND  THEFIRST SECRETARY OF THE SOVIET EMBASSYI met last night at a party the intelligent and talkative First Secretary of theSoviet Embassy, Mr. Rodionov. He spoke of the Labour Party delegation^ visit to Moscow and said, with every appearance of sincerity, that in the Embassy view it was a pity this had been a Labour Party and not a Conservative Partydelegation. So far as he could see, British relations with Russia were in no waydependent upon whether a Labour or a Conservative Government were in power indeed, they had in many ways been much better under the Conservative Govern-ment. It was therefore a pity that all the propaganda about the Moscow visitmust have left many people with the impression that the Labour Party got onbetter with the Russians than with the Conservatives.Mr. Rodionov then added that he also thought it was a great pity from thePrime Ministers point of view. The Prime Minister had made great efforts toreduce tension and improve relations between our two countries; it really was notfair that Mr. Attlee should appear to reap the fruits of this.I said that the Russian leaders were surely themselves entirely responsible forthe fact that they had not yet met the Prime Minister. It seemed to me that theyhad gone out of their way to rebuff the idea he had put before them. To mysurprise, Mr. Rodionov immediately admitted this was quite true. He added thatthe responsibility must be shared. He said that the British Cabinet and theKremlin had obviously been equally determined to prevent or postpone such ameeting. I took this opening to remind Mr. Rodionov that the Prime minister himself had not been prepared to come to Moscow and that any meeting wouldhave to be on neutral ground.I then probed into the reasons for the Soviet leaders&apos; reluctance to arrange sucha meeting. Mr. Rodionov said they were naturally most concerned to ensure thatsuch a meeting should be successful and pave the way to further reductions of tension. If the meeting achieved no definite result it would create great disillusion-ment and uncertainty, thus doing much more harm than good. He indicated thatthe Russian leaders were by no means sure what the Prime Minister really wanted to do at such a meeting and, with their naturally suspicious outlook, were reluctant to commit themselves to something the outcome of which they could not quiteforesee.One can never be sure with the Russians, but I know Mr. Rodionov quite welland I am pretty certain that he was speaking frankly. He occasionally used theformula &quot; this is what we think in the Embassy.&quot; His remarks are certainly verymuch in line with what I myself have long regarded as one of the main factors in soviet thinking on this subject. It is, however, certainly the first time in myexperience of the Russians that they have frankly admitted sharing responsibilityfor a development which it would be much easier to attribute entirely to the other party.(Signed) FRANK K. ROBERTS.August 14, 1954.
