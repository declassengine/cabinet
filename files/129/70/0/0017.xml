44&apos; f -CONFIDENTIAL*        -1 C.(54) 2677th August, 1954THE sudan memorandum by the Minister of state note was circulated to the Cabinet on 26th July (C. (54) 255)giving the views of the Mahdi on the constitutional position in the Sudan.2.        I have no doubt that many of the allegations made about Egyptianpressure are true.    But it is not correct to say that we have made no attempt to stop Egyptian interference.    We have made numerous protestsand the Governor-General has taken steps to reduce and control it.    More-over, Her Majesty&apos;s Governments views about Egyptian activities were made clear to the Egyptians in the last stage of the Suez negotiations and they can have no doubt about them.    They have promised that there will be animprovement.    I do not, however, believe that Egyptian propaganda andpressure will stop altogether in view of the long-standing Egyptian policyof &quot;unity of the Nile Valley&quot;.3.        A more important fact is that the Governor-General and others are of the opinion that Egyptian propaganda is beginning to overreach itself.The pro-unity party have tasted power and are becoming less willing toreceive orders from Cairo.    As the British officials begin to go and power is transferred, the Sudanese Government are likely to become more friendly and to rely on us to protect them from Egyptian domination.4.        The Umma Party wish us to denounce the agreement and to proclaim early independence.    That would be likely to produce the contraryeffect to what we desire.    It would be interpreted by the Sudanese Govern-ment either as an attempt to restore British rule or as a move to place theopposition in power, and would throw them back into the arms of the egyptians.    That in turn might well provoke disorders and thus force the Governor-General to proclaim a constitutional emergency.    There isno certainty that in this situation he would receive the support of the Mahdiand the Umma Party.    Although the Mahdi himself would not, I believe,turn against us, there is a considerable section of his followers whichwould not hesitate to do so.     In the debate on compensation the leader of the opposition was the only speaker to say derogatory things about theBritish.5.        The largest contribution to the success of the independence move-ment can be made by the Sudanese opposition itself.    This is not mentioned in the Mahdi&apos;s paper.    Feeling between the Khatmia andAnsar sects is strong.    The great obstacle to the success of theindependence movement is the Khatmi fear of eventual Mahdist domination of the Sudan.    The riots of March increased this fear.    It can only beCOPY NO.CABINET1
allayed by the opposition.     For the past eighteen months we have urged theUmma leaders to broaden the basis of their Party and to include non-Ansarelements.    The Socialist Republican Party (pro-independence but non-Ansar)was ready-made for the purpose.    But the Umma leaders both during theelection and since have failed to make any real effort in this direction.Until they do so they will not win the majority of votes.6.        The Governor-General, who is no optimist, now feels more hopefulabout developments in the Sudan, and believes that, if Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment continue to exercise patience in the carrying out of the Anglo-Egyptianagreement, our position will be increasingly strengthened.    Ke feels thatthe Sudanese of all Parties are well aware of the Egyptian danger, thatthey will increasingly resent Egyptian pressure and are likely to look moreand more to us for help and counsel.    The outstanding event of the last few months has been the surprisingly satisfactory compensation settlement,which was skilfully concluded by him.7.        Sudanese nationalism will be the dominant force and it should be our aim to make use of it.    We propose certain immediate practical stepsto this end:-(a)    In the first place I think we should invite the Prime Ministerto visit this country.    He has shown himself to bejealous of Sudanese independence and has establishedgood relations with the Governor-General.    A visithere would enable us to strengthen his feeling that wecan be relied upon to help towards an independentSudan.(b)We propose to invite a party of Sudanese Parliamentariansto London early next year.(c)We hope that the President of the Board of Trade and theMinister of Transport and Civil Aviation will beable to see the Sudanese Minister of Communica-tions when he is in this country in September.    Heis influential in the Sudanese Cabinet.(d)We hope to send a Trade Mission to Khartoum next spring.(e)We shall continue to emphasise unobtrusively, butfirmly, over matters such as foreign representation,a national flag, etc. , the separate entity of theSudan.S.L.Foreign Office, S.W.1.6th August, 1954.
