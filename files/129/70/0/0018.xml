l(TI-II3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)secret.(54) 26810th August, 1954REVIEW OF THE GENERAL, AGREEMENT on tariffs AND TRAPSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer it was agreed at the Commonwealth Finance Ministers Conferencein Sydney, in January this year, that the Review of the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.), which is expected to take place inNovember, should be preceded by discussions between the Commonwealth.It is intended that the Commonwealth discussions, which will be at a highofficial level, should begin in London on 5th October.    Prior to theirtaking place I shall be meeting Commonwealth Ministers informally in washington.    Among the important issues which the Review raises for us,and to which I must call the attention of my colleagues, are imperial preference and the accession of Japan to the G. A. T. T.   In the former,the question is how strongly it would be wise for us again to advocateImperial Preference to the Commonwealth.    The latter raises thequestion of whether we should give Japan full most-favoured-nation treat-ment for her goods, or only a qualified form of such treatment.    Wecannot finally decide our attitude in the Review itself until we have discussed these issues with the Commonwealth.    Meanwhile, thismemorandum sets out the policy which, in the light of the views expressedby my colleagues on the Committee of External Economic Policy, i suggest we should follow in the discussions with the Commonwealth.2.        Our aims at the Review, as part of our policy on trade generally,must, of course, be consistent with the rest of the economic and financial policy which has been adopted by the Commonwealth, the purpose of whichis to strengthen our economy through the expansion of production andtrade and to move in due course towards a system of multilateral tradeand payments covering the widest possible area.    With this objective  itseems clear that we must accept the G.A.T.T., despite imperfections, andstrive to improve it, both as an international code of trading suitable inpresent circumstances and as an instrument for the future.    Against this background we have considered how we should present ottr aims to theCommonwealth on the following issues.Imperial Preference3.        This covers several issues, including some of the problems connected with the accession of Japan, to which reference is made later,of considerable political delicacy.    We must have in mind not only what are our essential particular aims, but the need to continue to support the conception of Imperial Preference; at the same time we must avoidbeing placed in the false position of leading a forlorn attempt to extend its scope.COPY NO.  O iCABINET
4.       At the Commonwealth Economic Conference in December, 1952the United Kingdom proposed that all Commonwealth countries should join in seeking release from the &quot;no-new-preference&quot; rule in the G.A.T. T.in order to obtain a substantial extension of Imperial Preference.    Wewere unable to secure sufficient support.    Since then, we have in factsecured some degree of freedom through the negotiation of a waiver toincrease certain unbound duties.    Given a solution on the lines proposedin paragraph 7 below for the problem of the accession of Japan, ourimportant needs in the sphere of Imperial Preference are comparativelylimited and could be secured without a radical amendment to the rules ofthe G.A.T.T.   We must recognise that securing our freedom from the&quot;no-new-preference&quot; rule would involve the re-negotiation of our boundtariffs, a negotiation in which we should probably lose on balance:  indeed,we should find that in most cases these bilateral agreements would involveour undertaking to limit our use of Imperial Preference and so losingthe freedom we sought.    In any case, although the attitude of some commonwealth countries may have changed since 1952, it cannot be assumed that the whole Commonwealth would even now support a policy of extendedImperial Preference.    Canada, for example, and India would almost certainly remain in opposition.    There are, therefore, obvious limits towhat we can achieve.5.        Nevertheless, it is important that we should not be thought,whether in private or in public, to have abandoned the line we took in 1952and we must make it clear that we regard Imperial Preference as a legitimate instrument, compatible with the G.A.T.T., for fostering thestrength of the Commonwealth.    I shall have informal discussions withthose of the Commonwealth Finance Ministers who are in Washington atthe end of September.    This should provide a convenient opportunity to sound the Ministers out on their present attitude towards Preferences.After that we shall be in a better position to judge the possibilities.    Mean-while, the memorandum to the Commonwealth should be on the lines suggested in paragraph 15 below.    Thus,by the time we reach the Octobermeeting we and the Commonwealth should have had an opportunity to weighup the issues so that we can the better reach a common policy.    We must at the least press for full support for a policy of seeking waivers fromthe &quot;no-new-preference&quot; rule as and when necessary in the interests ofthe Colonies.    We must also find a Commonwealth solution to the problemof Japanese accession consistent with the requirements of imperial preference.Japan6.        On foreign policy grounds, it is essential that Japan should remainin the We stern camp.    There are therefore strong arguments, on these grounds, and indeed also on economic grounds, for granting most-favoured-nation rights for Japanese goods.     On the other hand, to agree to the accession of Japan to the G.A.T.T. without any qualifications would haveimmediate commercial disadvantages and would cause serious criticismat home.    Now is perhaps the time when we shall have the best chanceof bringing Japan into the G.A.T.T. with safeguards acceptable to us.There are two conditions which, if we could secure their acceptance bythe G.A.T.T. and Japan, would afford us protection against serious damage from Japanese competition:-
5b(i)     Australia, New Zealand and South Africa would have togive most-favoured-nation treatment to Japan if she wereunconditionally admitted to the G.A.T.T. and those countriesaccepted G.A.T.T. obligations towards her.    These countries are now heavily discriminating against Japan by tariffs andquotas to our advantage.    We should want them to have theright to continue existing tariff discrimination in order toprevent injury to our trade from disruptive japanese competition.    They might need to raise tariffs against japan to protect some of their own industries.    In order todo this they would, unless there were special provisions,have to increase the tariffs on those items against allcountries receiving most-favoured-nation treatment;  andthis would mean increasing the preferential rate to ourdetriment.   We should therefore, ideally, like provisions toenable them to discriminate against Japan.    (We know that australia is studying the question of granting most-favoured-nation treatment to Japan over a range of goods, and that new Zealand is now considering the results of talks with theJapanese which may have a similar outcome, and it cannot betaken for granted that they - or the East African Colonies -would in any event be prepared to exercise discrimination against Japan in our favour indefinitely. )(ii)     We ourselves want the right to take emergency action ifJapanese trade practices or Japanese competition becomeintolerable.7.        These objectives would be secured if we were able to amend theG.A.T.T. so as to allow an existing member (e. g. the United Kingdom orAustralia) which accepts G. A. T. T. obligations in relation to an accedingmember (Japan) to make this acceptance subject to the terms of a bilateraltreaty which would override the G.A.T.T. in certain respects.    We (and, ifthey agreed, Australia and other Commonwealth countries) would thennegotiate a treaty with Japan incorporating the required safeguards.    Itis important to us that such a treaty should take the form of a commercial treaty covering other matters besides tariffs and quota restrictions -particularly the treatment of shipping.8.        It will be difficult to persuade members of the G.A.T.T. to accept these proposals.    But the United States is extremely anxious for Japan tobe accepted in the G. A. T. T. by all the major members, and if we insist that we will only accept her on these terms, we believe this solution isnegotiable.    If this fails we shall have to consider the matter again, andmay have to examine an alternative scheme which would give us lessprotection.Other Issues9.        Besides the central issue of Imperial Preference and the associated problem of Japan there are a number of other aspects of theG.A.T.T. Review which we should wish to discuss at the commonwealth meeting; the only two I need mention now are quantitative import restrictions and subsidies.
10.       The existing provisions of the G.A.T.T. on quantitative import restrictions are about right in present circumstances, but at the Reviewwe should try to establish the permanent rules which will operate afterthe major currencies have become convertible.    To prevent othercountries from discriminating against sterling after convertibility, we need to tighten the rules limiting the use of restrictions for balance ofpayments reasons, and would propose to seek a provision that import restrictions should not be retained or imposed for longer than a year,with the possibility of an extension for a further year in cases ofparticular difficulty.    V7e should agree informally at the Review thatthis rule would take effect one year after convertibility, in order to giveeach country time to dismantle its remaining restrictions.11.        It is important that, within the terms of the G.A.T.T. as revised, we should retain the right to impose import restrictions without seeking prior approval if our balance of payments made this necessary;they would, however, be subject to subsequent justification.Subsidies1Z.       There is nothing in the G. A. T. T. as it is at present to prevent a country from introducing an export subsidy.    Details have to be notified to the G.A.T.T. and the country imposing the subsidy is merelyrequired to consult with any other member country feeling itself to be adversely affected.    These loose provisions were the most that theUnited States would accept.*13.       We have been adversely affected by the export subsidiesintroduced by other countries, for example the United States and Germany.The United States subsidy on citrus is of particular concern to growersin the West Indies.    The use of these devices is clearly against thewhole spirit of the G.A.T.T.    We should therefore ask for Commonwealthsupport in making a determined effort to strengthen the terms of theG.A.T.T. so as to get as near as we can to complete prohibition of export subsidies.    The United States will certainly demur at outright prohibitionbut our case is strong and should command wide support.    It is too much to hope for its full acceptance, but we should nevertheless extractthe utmost tactical advantage from pressing it.Memorandum for the Commonwealth14.       The next step is to give Commonwealth countries an indication of the issues as we see them, and which we propose to discuss at themeeting of Commonwealth officials in London at the beginning of October.There is little difficulty in giving them our views on the important issues of quantitative restrictions, and subsidies, and on various minor matters.But the question of Imperial Preference (with which is connected theproblem of Japan) raises the considerations mentioned in paragraphs 3-5above.    In the light of these, we must raise the subject with theCommonwealth in such a way as not to burke the difficulties set out inparagraph 4 and yet so as to reaffirm our historic loyalty to imperial preference.    In any case we should not prejudge the issues until wehave discussed them with the Commonwealth.
15.       Thus we could proceed on the following lines.    We would recall that, in December 1952, the United Kingdom had proposed that the Common-wealth should seek a radical amendment to the rules of the G.A.T.T. inregard to Imperial Preference.    We would go on to say that mostCommonwealth countries had, for various reasons, then been unable tosupport the policies we had in mind.    Since then, the United Kingdom,in accordance with the conclusions of the Commonwealth EconomicConference, has been able to secure freedom to meet some of itsparticular tariff difficulties.    We would like, before the Review of theG.A.T.T., to review with them the arguments for and against seekinggreater freedom in the G.A.T.T. to extend Imperial Preference.    In thisconnection, we should wish to discuss certain problems arising from theneeds of the Colonies (which do not all derive directly from the rules ofthe G.A.T.T.).    The question of the accession of Japan to the G.A.T.T.also arises in the context of Imperial Preference.    As a possible solution to this latter problem we would outline the proposal in paragraph 7 above.16.       I seek the approval of my colleagues to the preparation and then the submission to the Commonwealth of a memorandum on the lines indicated in paragraphs 14 and 15.17.       The final terms of the memorandum will, of course, be clearedwith the interested Ministers, with whom I shall also discuss my projectedconversations in Washington.    In this way I think we can do full justice to a difficult and important subject.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S. W.l.9th August, 1954.
