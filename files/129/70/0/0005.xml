Printed jor the Cabinet.   July 1954CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.Cf (5.4) 25526th July, 1954-^ CABINETTHE SUDANNote by the Secretary of the CabinetI circulate by direction of the Prime Minister the attached note representingthe views of the Mahdi on tiie constitutional position in the Sudan, which was handed to the Prime Minister by Lord Alexander of Hillsbprough.(Signed) NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th July, 1954.46524
In February, 1953 an agreement was signed in Cairo by Britain and Egyptlaying down the future constitutional development of the Sudan for a period whichwould carry the Sudan through elections for self-government, over an interim period and finally to self-determination. Self-determination was to be decided on two issues, (a) full independence or (b) an undefined relationship with Egypt.The first provision of the agreement was that both signatories would ensurethat the Sudanese should enjoy &quot; a free and neutral atmosphere &quot; during theelections and throughout the transitional period of self-determination.We were sure that Britain would carry out her promises but it was not long before it became clear that Egypt had no intention of allowing an agreement tohalt the efforts which succeeding Egyptian Governments had made continuouslyover thirty years to obtain complete control over the Sudan.For the record-we list below some of the flagrant breaches of faith and clearcases of Egyptian interference in the Sudan in the past 15 months:  1. Substantial financial aid to the pro-Egyptian parties in the Sudan.2. Unceasing propaganda in support of Unity of the Nile Valley, and openattacks on Independence leaders and their movement through theGovernment-controlled Press and radio in Cairo. These were aimed at the Sudan in beamed radio programmes and by subsidising aircarriage of Egyptian newspapers to the Sudan.3. Prior to the Sudan elections in November the Egyptian Government gaveleave of absence to thousands of Sudanese employed by the Govern-ment in Cairo to go to the Sudan and use their influence to help the production-Egyptian party in its election campaign. These men were given upto 4 months&apos; leave on full pay to carry out their political assignment.4. During the election campaign all the resources of the Egyptian Govern-ment departments in the Sudan were thrown behind the NationalUnionist Party. Specifically the personnel and equipment of theEgyptian Irrigation Department in the Southern Sudan were placed atthe disposal of Unity candidates on demand.5. Money, propaganda and promises having achieved a numerical advantage to the pro-Egyptian side in the first Sudan Parliament, the egyptian government then redoubled her efforts and Major Salah &quot;Salem,Minister for National Guidance and for Sudan Affairs, came to theSudan accompanied by General Abdel Hakim Amer and a bevy of egyptian journalists and toured the Sudan in Egyptian Governmentaircraft making blatantly propaganda speeches, in one of which he con-temptuously described the Cairo Agreement as &quot; a useless piece of paper.&quot; -

Money, propaganda and promises having achieved a numerical advantage to the pro-Egyptian side in the first Sudan Parliament, the egyptian government then redoubled her efforts and Major Salah Salem,Minister for National Guidance and for Sudan Affairs, came to theSudan accompanied by General Abdel Hakim Amer and a bevy of egyptian journalists and toured the Sudan in Egyptian Governmentaircraft making blatantly propaganda speeches, in one of which he con-temptuously described the Cairo Agreement as &quot;a useless piece of paper.&quot; -
6. Large numbers of Egyptian students were also sent to the Sudan ostensiblyfor educational purposes, but in fact to add to the propaganda barrage.7. In an effort to utilise the personal prestige of the Egyptian President,General Neguib himself visited the Sudan on 1st March, 1954, withunfortunate results.8. Egypt has allotted a not inconsiderable part of her budget for the estab-lishment of a university, schools (with particular emphasis on theSouthern Sudan), hospitals and religious institutions spread throughoutthe Sudan.9. Egypt offered and has sent a gift of arms and ammunition to the Sudan, has promised to send aeroplanes, and has offered to accept a number ofSudanese for training in aviation and other military activities.10. Finally, Major Salem has started a special fund in Cairo by public donationto help the Sudan Government to pay the compensation of foreignofficials whose contracts will be terminated under Sudanisation.The above instances are but examples of continuing Egyptian interference inthe affairs of the Sudan, in direct contravention of the assurances made in the cairo Agreement.Whilst Britain has, in fact, fully carried out her promises not to interfere, theIndependence Movement in the Sudan feels that by making no attempt to stop, or at least control, Egyptian interference, Britain has failed to carry out the spirit ofthe Agreement.The blatant interference of Egypt in the domestic affairs of the Sudan includingpost-election subborning of individual M.Ps. culminated in the pressure brought onthe present pro-Egyptian Sudan Government which has resulted in the removal ofthe representative of the Independence Movement from membership of theGovernor GeneraFs Commission and his replacement by a second Unionist Partymember. In effect, this removes Independence representation in a vital organ of theconstitution. .This matter was the subject of special representation to the British and egyptian Governments by the Umma Party on 4th May this year. The UmmaParty, in drawing the attention of the Co-domini to what they considered to be aserious violation of the Constitution, said that in such circumstances they mighthave to consider the Agreement to be broken and therefore invalid.It is the view of the Independence Movement in the Sudan that if Egyptianinterference is allowed to continue unchecked, the Sudan is in great danger of becoming little more than a province of Egypt. This is not the wish of the peopleof the Sudan. The figures supplied in the official report of the ElectoralCommission prove that, despite powerful Egyptian interference, the Governmentin office does not represent a majority of the electorate. These figures show that275,000 voted for Independence candidates, and only 230,000 for pro-Unitycandidates.The majority of the politically conscious Sudanese and, behind them, the great mass of the people have always believed in the British assurance that the Sudanwould eventually be led to full independence.  The passive policy adopted by Her
Majesty&apos;s Government and the British Sudan administration before and duringthe elections had no small influence on the results. The continuance of that policy since the election has weakened Sudanese faith in British promises, and givenstrength to Egyptian claims that Britain only keeps her word when it is convenient for her to do so. Many Sudanese have come to believe the allegation that her majesty&apos;s Government is prepared to sacrifice the Sudan in exchange for asatisfactory agreement with Egypt on the Suez Canal.
