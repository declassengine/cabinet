HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTI &quot;-1 1---Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1954SECRET Copy No.   7 3C. (54) 30028th September, 1954CABINETEUROPEAN DEFENCE: M. MENBES-FRANCE AND GERMANY&apos;SENTRY INTO THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY organisation memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate to my colleagues herewith a Note by Sir G. Jebb (Annex A),referring to Sir R. Makins&apos; telegram No. 2068 of 24th September (Annex B).A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,28th September, 1954.ANNEX AI see that Mr. Dulles told the Chancellor of the Exchequer that &quot; accordingto Murphy &quot; Mendes-France had said that he was &quot; not in favour of Germany&apos;sentry into N.A.T.O., which would not be acceptable to French opinion.&quot;Achilles showed me Murphy&apos;s actual telegram to Dulles recording his meeting with Mendes-France, which I summarised in my telegram No. 676. I have norecollection of Murphy having made in that telegram the remark attributed tohim by Dulles, though it may well be that Mendes-France mentioned at some stage that France was not as a whole in favour of Germany joining N.A.T.O., which ofcourse is the case. This, however, is a very different thing from suggesting thatMendes-France will actually oppose Germany&apos;s entry into N.A.T.O. On thecontrary, he has agreed to this; provided of course that he can get agreement on safeguards.ANNEX BFrom Washington to Foreign office sir R. Makins(No. 2068)September 24, 1954.European Security.Chancellor of Exchequer paid a brief courtesy visit with Mr. Dulles to-day and found him in a pessimistic mood about the prospects of the Nine-power conference.2. This pessimism was based on telegrams which he had received fromMurphy in Paris. According to Murphy, Mendes-France had said that he was notin favour of Germany&apos;s entry into N.A.T.O., which would not be acceptable to46871
French opinion; and that his real objective was a new E.D.C. with Britain in.Murphy had also seen Alphand who had expressed the view that Mendes-france was looking in the longer term to the fali of Adenauer and the advent of asocialistic government in Germany leading to a rapprochement with Russia.3. Mendes-France also seems to have told Murphy that the london conference must not be allowed to fail; that it could continue for a week or two weeks and that thereafter a month should be given to the experts to work out thesolution.4. Dulles then said that he greatly valued his visit to London and had discussions with you and the Prime Minister. He was most appreciative of yourefforts with the European countries in the last couple of weeks and said he was wholly sympathetic with your policy objectives in Europe.
