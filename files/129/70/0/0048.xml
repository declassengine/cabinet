(54) 298   ; \- .  &apos; .27th September, 1954.&apos;vV .&apos; CABINETLONDON CONFERENCE &apos;MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSThe problem will be to reconcile-  ; .(i) the German desire for rapid restoration of sovereignty and membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.AT.O.);(ii) French reluctance to admit either, until elaborate safeguards have been,  /       agreed, notably a complicated.and probably unworkable system for thecontrol of armament manufacture on the Continent; and/(iii) American reluctance or inability to repeat the undertakings they gavein connection with the European Defence Community (E.D.C.) aboutmaintaining American military strength in Europe.2. M. Mendes-France may press the Conference stQ agree to this or thatunnecessary or dangerous proposal on the grounds that without it he will not get a favourable vote from the French Assembly. We carinOl allow our discussions to be conducted on this basis. The task of the Conference must be to produce a workable plan designed to meet legitimate French requirements but not to attempttortuous gymnastics in order to get a majority for - M, Mendes-France.    ,3. If we produce a workable plan the Americans are&apos; unlikely to allow it tdfail through the lack of the essential American support., If, however, we are to do this it will be necessary for the French, to face some unpleasant realities. Theywill have to accept German sovereignty and German membership of N.A.T.O. andwithdraw or drastically reduce their safeguard proposals. If they are to do this,they must be given some striking quid pro quo. The assurance most likely to strikeFrench opinion is the continued presence of British, troops in Europe. the undertakings on this subject given in the context of the E.D.C. Treaty are set outin an Annex.4. In my opinion the key to the success of the Conference will be a newcommitment by the United Kingdom to maintain our present forces on theContinent and not to withdraw them against the wishes of the majority of the enlarged Brussels Treaty Powers. This would not give France a veto, but weshould no longer be able to withdraw forces at our sole discretion and would haveto obtain the consent of the majority of the seven expanded Brussels Treatypartners, who should take their decision in knowledge of the Supreme Commander,Europe&apos;s (SACEUR&apos;s) views. Given our close , ties with the three benelux countries, I think we can always rely on obtaining this majority if we have areasonable case. It would be necessary also to provide for certain exceptions tothe general rule: an overseas emergency so acute that there was no&apos;time to go through the process of consultation, or balance of payments difficulties which made it financially impossible for us to maintain the strength of our forces on theContinent.5. I realise that this would be an unprecedented commitment for the UnitedKingdom, but the hard fact is that it is impossible to organise an effective defence system in Western Europe, which in turn is essential for the security of the United46867 &apos;   . &apos; :   .:Printed for the Cabinet.

Kingdom, without a major British contribution. This situation will persist formany years to come. By recognising this fact and giving the new commitment wemay succeed in bringing the Germans and the French together and keeping the americans in Europe. If we do not, the Conference may fail and the atlantic alliance fall to pieces.6. I therefore seek the authority of my colleagues to give a new Britishundertaking at an appropriate stage during the Conference. It will be mostimportant meantime to keep it secret. This undertaking would be (i) to maintain on the Continent the effective strength of the British forces now assigned to SACEUR, i.e., our four divisions and the Tactical AirForce, or whatever SACEUR regards as equivalent fighting capacity;and(ii) not to withdraw those forces against the wishes of a majority of the brussels Treaty Powers, who should take their decision in knowledgeof SACEUR&apos;s views.7. This undertaking would be subject to the understanding that an acuteoverseas emergency might oblige us to short-circuit this procedure and that, if themaintenance of our forces on the continent of Europe throws at any time too heavy a strain on the external finances Of the United Kingdom, it will be open to theUnited Kingdom to ask that the financial conditions on which the formations are maintained should be reviewed by the North Atlantic Council.. - . . &apos; -     &apos; A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,.   27 th September, 1954.&apos; ANNEX   &apos;British Undertakings to the European Defence Community(1) In the United Kingdom/European Defence Community Treaty of 1952,we promised automatic military assistance to any E.D.C.
