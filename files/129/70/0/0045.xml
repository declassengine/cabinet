secret. (54) 29523rd September, 1954CABINETANGLO-PAKISTAN relations note by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations on his way to Washington I had a long talk with Ch. Mohamad Ali, the pakistan Finance Minister and the ablest member of the Pakistan Government.Our talk covered such a wide range of Pakistan affairs and was so instructive thatI annex a record of it for the information of my colleagues.SWINTON.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,22nd September, 1954.Copy No.      6046847Printed for the Cabinet.

ANNEXIn a talk this morning with Ch. Mohamad Ali, which lasted for over an hourand a half, we covered a lot of ground.2.&quot; On the balance of payments he said that he thought his revised estimateof a deficit of 10 crores would not be exceeded. The effects of the floods in EasternBengal, while causing great individual hardship and involving the pakistan government in additional expenditure, relief and repairs, which would fall upon their internal budget, would not materially affect the balance of payments. Therice crop was not seriously affected. With the stocks of rice they had, there wouldcertainly be no need to import rice. There was much damage to the jute crop.But if this damage had not taken place they would have had a large excess ofjute. Fazlul Huq&apos;s Government had stupidly taken off all restrictions on plantingand encouraged farmers to plant jute and told them they would get a good price.Before the floods Pakistan was therefore looking forward to an excess of jutewhich would depress the price and be difficult to sell. As it was, jute productionand sales would level out.3. Mohamad Ali then went on to talk about the administration problems in eastern Bengal. Just before he left for Europe, Mohamad Ali had seen IskanderMirza, Governor of East Bengal, who gave him a very encouraging account.Mohamad Ali said that Iskander Mirza had done a remarkable job. He hadalready put the administration on a sound basis; he had suppressed a mass ofcorruption, stimulated the officers in charge, and given the territory a sense of security and solidarity. He had travelled widely during the floods and, whatwas most remarkable, had become personally popular with the mass of the people.For the first time people felt that their interests were being considered and thatthere was an administration both effective and understanding.4. I asked Mohamad Ali about the future. He said the Pakistan Governmenthad not made up their minds about this. Suhrawardy* had survived all hisoperations in Switzerland and would be returning to Pakistan in a month or two.It was possible that they might decide that Suhrawardy could be entrusted to forma Government which would be both efficient and loyal to the Centre. They were already recruiting a number of Muslim civil servants who they hoped, under the regime Iskander Mirza had installed, would be reasonably competent and incorrupt.Very likely Pakistan would carry on the present form of Government until afterthe central and provincial elections which would take place under the newConstitution.5. I then asked Mohamad Ali about the progress of the Constitution. Hesaid that the outstanding problems were settled except the division of functions as between the Central Government and the local Government in Eastern Bengal.He had decided to publish a White Paper showing how Eastern Bengal benefitedfrom the existing financial allocations. Eastern Bengal was doing very well andthe Central Government anticipated, with a new understanding of this position,that there would be no difficulty on this score. Mohamad Ali&apos;s only hesitationabout publication had been that it would show how large a share of the revenueEastern Bengal received, and that there might be an adverse reaction in WesternPakistan; but the Government had decided that as there had been so muchmisunderstanding and misrepresentation, it was a good thing to get the true factsinto the open. They still hoped to get the Constitution through at the end ofNovember and his Prime Minister was fairly confident of keeping to the time-table;but it might be delayed until the end of the year or possibly early next year. Itwas more important to get it right than to rush it.6. We then went on to talk about American aid. Mohamad Ali said thateverybody in Pakistan had greatly appreciated what I had said about this and theunreasonableness of the Indian attitude. Mohamad Ali had no idea how much the americans were prepared to find. He was going to discuss this in Washington. Hewould put to the American Administration that the aid ought to be economic aswell as military; that Pakistan wanted to make its military contribution but at the* Mr. H. F.

Founder member of opposition party called &quot; All-Pakistan Awami League &quot;.
same time be sufficiently strong on the economic side to support its own defencewithout relying upon outside aid. Today military expenditure was an enormousproportion of the Budget 50 or 60 per cent. The Pakistan people were looking for some relief on this. Mohamad Ali was prepared to tell them that they must bear this burden for a time as the insurance of peace. But they must look forward to some relief in this respect or they might revolt against so heavy a military load.7. I found Mohamad Ali very realistic about thesubject Of American military aid and also on the importance of British association in all military matters. I saidthat I had been surprised to find here how large a proportion of military expenditure was on maintenance as compared with new equipment. Mohamad Ali said thatthey were finding the same and that he was very much alive to the risk of acceptinga gift of American equipment and then finding that they had to spend a lot of dollarson the maintenance of that equipment if American military aid stopped. But apart altogether from this, the association of Pakistan with Britain over the whole militaryfield was essential. Pakistan had carried on our training system and methods andit would be extravagant and unwise to duplicate equipment.8. We then talked about Japan. Mohamad Ali said that he thought he wouldprobably have to do a deal with Japan; they Were already negotiating. I suggestedit might be well not to conclude this deal until the Commonwealth countries had had their meeting about Japan and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.Mohamad Ali said he would consider this; and I suggested he should talk to theChancellor about it when they meet in Washington. Mohamad Ali said if he did do a deal with Japan it would at the same time be his aim to maintain and if possibleincrease the aggregate of United Kingdom imports.9. In this connection and generally on cotton textiles, Mohamad Ali said thatthe Pakistan domestic production and tariff was designed to develop and protect the coarser goods in which Lancashire would find it most difficult to compete with japan and not the higher grade English textiles. He appreciated our political difficulties. But if our trade as a whole was held or increased, and if our highgrade trade in textiles was not compromised, he hoped that Lancashire would notbe too unreasonable. I said that the closer the contact was with Lancashire the better, so that there should be a mutual understanding at first hand.10. This led me to ask Mohamad Ali about the exceptional cases wheretextiles had been manufactured specially for Pakistan by Lancashire firms and could not be sold elsewhere. Mohamad Ali said that he would do his best toallow imports in these exceptional cases, but that these special concessions mustbe confined to genuine cases of this kind. I asked him to discuss this in detail with the Board of Trade. &apos; , \11. We then had a very long and frank talk about water supplies. MohamadAli was clearly unhappy about this. He said that long before I, or indeed theWorld Bank, had taken a hand, away back in &apos;50 or early &apos;51, he believed hecould have done a better deal with the Indian Government. He had got a longway with the Indian water engineer, who was an old friend and was more interested in water than in politics, and he had had a lot of discussion with Nehruin Delhi. He admitted that when the politicians got at Nehru, Nehru had become less forthcoming. Anyway that deal had not been done and the World Bank had offered their services.12. Mohamad Ali admitted that the World Bank had wanted to be ashelpful as possible; but he thought the World Bank had been over impressedfrom the start by Indian intransigence. Instead of looking at the thing as a purelyengineering proposition, and then modifying the right engineering solution to meetpolitical difficulties, the Bank had tended to adopt a solution which would be politically acceptable to India and not right from the engineering point of view.The result was that the Bank&apos;s proposal allowed far less flow of water from theEastern rivers than the Indians would have been prepared to give in 1951, andcompelled Pakistan to get a much larger proportion from expensive storage damson the Indus. This would mean a much greater financial obligation on Pakistan.Mohamad Ali admitted that it was physically possible to get the water fromstorage dams, but he did not believe that the Indian Government would contributea fair share of the cost of these dams and that this would fall on Pakistan. Therewould also be a great delay in reasonable development in Pakistan even if thesedams were constructed.
.13. There would also be interminable: discussion on how much waterPakistan was entitled to, directly or indirectly,, at Indian expense. By this hemeant how much water ought Pakistan to be entitled to claim as part of a commonsystem which had been planned and started before self-government or partition.The, Indians would always be trying to whittle this away. Mohamad Ali said he took his stand on what had been planned by the Secretary of State for India, wholaid down what amount of water should flow to Pakistan from the combinedundertaking to the Sukkar irrigation and other schemes which were in the originalBritish Indian plan. I said that, when they were negotiating under the auspices ofthe World Bank as to what was a reasonable supply to get from India, or atIndia&apos;s expense, Pakistan would be on strong ground in saying that what was planned and agreed before independence was a reasonable claim for Pakistan tomake.14. In the end Mohamad Ali said that they had been faced with a greatdifficulty in the Pakistan Cabinet. This difficulty was enhanced by the fact thatirrigation in Pakistan was a provincial subject, and that both provincial and centralpoliticians had to explain to their constituent farmers what water they were goingto get. There had also been a lot of nonsense talked about annual averages.Averages meant nothing. The farmer had to irrigate his land in June and september. If there was no water in the irrigation canals, at the critical times,his crop failed; and it was no consolation for him to be told what the average flow of water was at other times in the year. In spite of all this the Pakistan cabinet had decided to accept the World Bank proposal and to renew the negotiations.Having given their word they would carry out their agreement in good faith, buthe had pressed very strongly that the Bank and the independent engineers, whowould be brought in, (and he was quite content to leave the choice of theseengineers to the Bank) should now deal with the matter in an entirely practicalway without being diverted by Indian pressure to make political concessions whichwere unjustified.15. I was glad to find Mohamad Ali in much better health, in good heart,and full of courage.SWINTON.Commonwealth Relations Office,20th September, 1954.
