(54) 2879th September 1954CABINETTHE KABAKA OF BUGANDAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies think I should keep my colleagues informed of the way the situation is developing in Uganda.2. In making his statement to the House on 23rd February in which heoutlined Her Majesty&apos;s Governments policy on the future of the uganda protectorate, Mr. Lyttelton said:  &quot; There are constitutional questions relating to Buganda in particular the future relations between the Kabakaship, the Ministers and the GreatLukiko, and the Lukiko and the Legislative Council which must.be looked at now so that we can decide On what lines it is best for those relationships todevelop.The Baganda themselves should clearly take a leading part in working out these problems. To help in this, the Governor and I have agreed that anindependent expert should be invited to go out to Uganda. He will consult with representatives of the Baganda and with the Protectorate Governmentto help reach agreed recommendations for Her Majesty&apos;s Government toconsider.&quot;3. The expert, Professor Hancock, arrived in Uganda in the latter part ofJune. During the first month he conferred with a committee of Baganda appointedby the Lukiko for that purpose. Thereafter, the Governor joined the discussions and it became apparent that a basis of agreement might be found. The Governorconferred with me in mid-August and I authorised him to reach an agreement withthe Committee on the lines set out below; these heads of agreement which Iexpect to be concluded and initialled shortly will require ratification by the Lukikoon behalf of the Baganda and thereafter approval by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.The main features of the agreement are likely to be as follows:  (i) The Kabaka will become a constitutional ruler in accordance with thegeneral wish of the Baganda and the executive authority in Buganda willbe exercised in his name by six Buganda ministers, subject to theGovernor^ power of formal advice.(ii) The Baganda in effect accept, for the first time, the principle of the protectorate as a Unitary State and agree willingly to participate in thepolitical institutions of the Protectorate Government.(iii) The Protectorate Government will delegate certain spheres of authority tothe Buganda Government (we are already committed to this in the reforms announced in March, 1953, with the approval of Mr. Lyttelton);these powers will be subject to change from time to time by mutual agreement.(iv) A Ministerial system will be introduced into the Executive Council of the protectorate Government.  Four or five uhofficials will be appointed46781
Ministers and two or three of them will be given portfolios. Asubstantial official majority will, however, be retained in the Council.In addition two or three African UnderrSecretaries will be appointed,but will not be members of the Council. , .(v) These arrangements will be reviewed after a period of not less than fiveand not more than ten years.An agreement of this kind would be in line with Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfsdeclared intention to develop Uganda as a primarily African country and yet wouldfully safeguard the position of the Protectorate Government and its power of advising the Buganda Government. It would have the great advantage (whichwas the main object of the Hancock mission) that for the first time it would ensurethe co-operation and willing participation of the Baganda in the ProtectorateLegislative Council and draw them away from their former separatist attitude.4. When this agreement is presented to the Lukiko the issue of KabakaMutesa will inevitably again be raised, if public and press speculation has not already raised it. Despite denials by Professor Hancock himself that he is in anyway concerned with the issue of Mutesa, many Baganda regard the Hancockdiscussions as a means for securing his return. It will probably be raised in one oftwo forms; either the Lukiko will say that they are only prepared to accept theproposals on condition that Mutesa is allowed to return or they will maintain that the only authority competent to accept the proposals is the Kabaka and that nothing can therefore be done in his absence.5. The virtual certainty that this will happen and the entirely new situation created by the transformation of the Kabaka into a constitutional ruler and hisremoval from the political arena, will in my view present a grave problem. after full deliberation I have come to the conclusion that we shall have once again to review the decision on Kabaka Mutesa and consider whether in this changed situation it is possible and advisable to permit his return. The balance of advantageis, in my opinion and the Governors, very evenly weighed.6. On the one hand the great majority of the Baganda want Mutesa back and there is no doubt that feelings run very deep. They will be encouraged by certain sections of opinion in this country including the Anglican missionary bodies.The grounds on which Her Majesty&apos;s Government affirmed its decision in the face of the Kabaka&apos;s recantation in December that on his past record his word couldnot be trusted will no longer be so strong since in future the ProtectorateGovernment will deal with the Buganda Ministers and not with the Kabaka on all matters of policy affecting Buganda. It is almost certain that there will be nomove to elect a new Kabaka until all proceedings in the current Court casechallenging Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs withdrawal of recognition have been concluded. These proceedings, including final appeal to the Privy Council, may take a year or more. During this period there is a risk of increasing politicaltrouble in Buganda and still more important the political deadlock and long delay in electing a new Kabaka may permanently impair relations between theBaganda and the British, through the wound being allowed to fester. Finally and also very important indeed if we maintain the present decision on the kabaka, we are likely to lose this opportunity, the first we have, of securing theagreement of the Baganda to participate fully in Protectorate affairs, which is vital to the future welfare and progress of the country as a whole.7. On the other hand, if we permitted Mutesa to return, we should be lettingdown our friends in Buganda who have co-operated during the recent difficultmonths. Though they are few, they are drawn from the older and more responsible elements; practically none however have come out into the openagainst Mutesa. We should be encouraging the worst elements, the bunch ofne&apos;er-do-wells with whom Mutesa had previously surrounded himself and would doubtless do so again. Mutesa was responsible for many of the difficultiespreviously experienced with the Buganda Government. If he is still so minded, orreturned embittered by recent events, he might be able to do much mischief behind the scenes, despite constitutional safeguards. His return would be taken very hardlyby some people in the Government Service, in particular the British administrative officers in Buganda who have borne the brunt of last year&apos;s unpopular decision.Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs prestige might be affected. Represented as a victoryfor the Baganda, the future effect both on them and on other tribes might be serious.  Indeed to reverse a decision which has been repeatedly declared&quot; to be
final might have repercussions throughout Africa and perhaps in many colonial territories: Moreover, I have no doubt that the reaction at least initially among our supporters in the House and indeed in certain quarters on the Opposition side would be very unfavourable.8. There is a further complication in the Court case in which it is sought to challenge the validity of the withdrawal of recognition. This is down for hearingin Uganda on 27th September. I am advised that there is little risk of an adversedecision but there is no doubt that the case will attract large crowds and intensivePress publicity with a consequent rise in the general temperature and emotionalatmosphere in Buganda. *9. I discussed the matter at great length with the Governor last month. Hisconsidered conclusion at that time was that on balance the right decision in thenew situation and the one which would best serve the future interests of Ugandawould be to permit the Lukiko to decide whether they would elect a new Kabakaor invite Mutesa to return. He proposed that this choice should be exercised ina year&apos;s time so as to give time for the new constitutional arrangements to beestablished and for people to adjust themselves to the new situation. He also proposed that the decision should be subject to strict conditions, including fullacceptance of the constitutional proposals by the Lukiko and a solemn engagementto be entered into by the Kabaka to accept the new constitution and to co-operate with the Protectorate Government. It was an essential element in this advice thatthe initiative should come from Her Majesty&apos;s Government and that theannouncement of this decision, if taken, should be made before presentation of theHancock proposals to the Lukiko led to the renewal of popular clamour forMutesa&apos;s return.10. The Governor informed me that his senior official advisers did not sharehis view; but he also informed me that Professor Hancock, whom he had consulted in strict confidence without disclosing his own view, had told him that he believedthe balance of advantage lay in allowing Mutesa to return on strict conditionsprovided this could be done from a position of strength.11. I informed the Governor that while I understood his reasons for wishing to retain the initiative I was unable to come to a firm conclusion without moremature consideration and that in any case in my view no decision could be taken until the High Court in Uganda had delivered its judgment in the first round of thecase.12. Both the Governor and 1 therefore intend to review the matter again inthe light of the situation prevailing after the case has been heard. The governor has naturally made it clear to me that, if the initiative has by then passed away from us, he may wish to give different advice at that time. I shall probably make a briefstay in Uganda for a personal appreciation on the spot on the way to Tanganyika,if I am able to keep an engagement entered into as Minister of Transport to open the Dar-es-Salaam airfield. That visit, if made, would be in October and wouldprobably take place between the hearing of the case and delivery of the judgment.13. I am informing my colleagues of these developments now in order thatthey may be prepared to come to a final decision in this matter at a later date,when I shall circulate a further paper. I must add that, though I am keeping an open mind and realise that the arguments are very evenly balanced, if it had been necessary for me to frame a recommendation at this stage in advance of myproposed visit, my own inclination looking at the future interests of Uganda only would have been to permit the Kabaka&apos;s return under the conditions I have mentioned.A.
