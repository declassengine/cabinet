BmS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT ^^flThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. ^^^kIt is issued for the personal use oi.d/^.(h/?y&gt;?^rr&gt;.3^&gt;^^  TOP SECRET Copy No..........I C.(54) 257I 27th July, 1954CABINET? _ ?^^^H ----- ^^^^HDEFENCE POLICYMemorandum by the Minister of SupplyI ^ i IThe Cabinet will shortly be considering the report by the CommitteeBon Defence Policy (C. (54) 250). ^^fl2.        This report suggests a number of possible reductions in defencea expenditure which, if accepted, would result in a defence budget for 1955/56moi  1 ^30 millions (including a provision of  80 millions for the BritishI forces in Germany).^^Hi 3.       It is most important that an early decision be taken as to whether? the country&apos;s finances can stand a defence budget of  1,630 millions and,? if not, what lesser sum is to be made available.    For, until this figure is? fixed, the size and shape of the forces to be maintained cannot be finallyK determined.i 4.        The Committee has so far concentrated its main attention upon#*^e overaH financial problem and it has, I think, done valuable work inshowing that a substantial reduction in defence expenditure can be accepted.5. On the other hand, it has not had an opportunity fully to considerKhow such funds as may be available could most advantageously be?apportioned among the various elements of our defence effort.6. In particular, the Committee has not yet had time to examine inI any detail the possible economies set out in Annex I of their report. TheseBare suggestions put forward separately by each of the Service DepartmentsBon its own responsibility; and the Chiefs of Staff have not so far submittedI their joint comments upon them.7. The Committee have had some discussion upon certain items in? Annex I.    But many important issues raised by these proposals have notI yet been considered, for example: the Navy&apos;s building programme; navalI aircraft requirements; the proposed cuts in the reserve fleet; the sizeI of the cruiser force; the proposed cessation of minersweeper construction;I the strength of the Regular Army; the formations required to fulfil ourI present commitments; the size of the Strategic Reserve; the possibilityI of increasing the contribution of Colonial troops; the number of^       i Territorial divisions required; the size of R. A. F. Transport Command;W the size of R.A. F. Coastal Command; expenditure on preparations forchemical and bacteriological warfare; and the whole field of research ^^^|I and development.
I I8. In the circumstances I hope that the Cabinet, whilst fixing aglobal figure for the defence budget as a whole, will consider referring  back to the Committee the question of the apportionment of that sumamong the various elements which comprise our defence effort.9. The Committee should be in a position to report back to theCabinet not later than the middle of September.    Meanwhile, they might?be empowered to authorise action on all matters upon which there is BAVJagreement, other than those raising large issues of policy.JB D,s*!Ministry of Supply, W. C. 2.
