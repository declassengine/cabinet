secret .(5*0 27526th August. 195*4-cabinet proposed TREATY ON THE DEFENCE OF SOUTH-EAST ASIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will recall that, &quot;by the terms of the minuteagreed at Washington &quot;between the Prime Minister and the Presidentof the United States (circulated to the.Cabinet on 7th July asC0(5*4-) 225), a joint United Kingdom/United States Study Groupwas established in Washington to prepare agreed recommendations on the terms of a Collective Security Pact for South-East Asia.As a result, it has been agreed that representatives of theGovernments of Australia, France, Now Zealand, Pakistan, the philippines, Siam, the United Kingdom and the United States shallmoot in Manila on 6th September in order to consider measures for the establishment of a Collective Security arrangement,.The purpose of this meeting will be to agree on a Treaty andthere has already been much preliminary discussion, without commitment, of its text, a draft of which has been prepared bythe State Department.2e     No real divergence of view between the United States and ourselves exists on most of the Articles of the draft Treaty,although we have proposed certain minor amendments with which I need not trouble my colleagues.3o     The substantially agreed Articles cover (apart from the preamble) an undertaking to settle international disputes by peaceful means and to refrain from the threat or use of forcein any manner inconsistent with, the purposes of the united nations;    and to maintain and develop resistance to armed attack and to subversive activities from without by means of continuousself-help and consultation and co-operation;    recognition ofthe importance of promoting economic prosperity, and of the partthat economic and technical assistance can play;    the establish-mont of a Council;    an acknowledgement that the Treaty does not affect rights and obligations of the parties under the charter of the United Nations or the responsibility of the United nations for the maintenance of peace and security;    a power to inviteby unanimous agreement any other state to accede to the Treaty;a definition of the Treaty area;   a provision for ratificationand a final Article governing the duration of the Treaty.1+.     The essential feature of the Treaty is to be found in theprovisions of Article IV and it is in respect of this Articlothat there is still some difference of approach between theUnitod States Government and ourselves.     I set out in an annexcomparative.texts:-(i)    of the most recent American version ofArticle TV;    and(ii)    our own latest proposals as submitted to washington amending the American version,,COPY N0e
5.     Article IV is divided into two parts, the first dealingwith a situation in which aggression &quot;by means of armed attacktakes place, the second in which a threat develops otherwise than &quot;by means of such aggression.     The aggression v/hich is contemplated in the first paragraph of the Article is armed attack against (a) the territory in South-East Asia and theSouth-V/est Pacific of any of the parties to the Treaty;(b) Laos, Cambodia, South Viet-Eam;    and (c) any other state or territory in the area that the parties subsequently andunanimously agree to designate060     The main point of difference revealed by comparison ofthese two drafts is that the United States Government wish to specify &quot;Communist Aggression&quot; as the only type of armed attack which the parties would undertake to resist.     In our vievi/- theuse of this phrase seems needlessly provocative and calculated to make it very difficult for some of the Asian countries to adhere to the Treaty if at a later stage they wish to do so.The alternative version which we have now submitted followsclosely the formula employed in the North Atlantic Treaty andlimits obligations undertaken by any one of the parties to theTreaty to &quot;taking such action as it deems necessary&quot;.     this limitation would enable the United States or ourselves or anyother party to take only diplomatic action in the event of thodispute being of a purely local character (e,,g. Kashmir) s7o     The second part of Article IV deals with threats toterritorial integrity otherwise than by armed attack.     TheAmerican wording is unduly vague and here again I should prefer to follow closely the wording of the comparable Article in theNorth Atlantic Treaty.     In any case the undertaking in thisparagraph is limited to consultation.     In my view thisparagraph should be extended to cover, not only the partiesthemselves, but also Laos, Cambodia and South Viet-Nam, togetherwith any other state or territory to which the provisions oftho first paragraph of the Article may subsequently be applied,8.     I am most anxious that Article IV(i) should be as accept-able as possible to Asian opinion and should not be open to objection on the ground that the parties are unilaterallyproposing to take action about an armed attack on, for instance,Burma, without consulting in any way the Government concerned.In order to meet this difficulty I have proposed to the americans that, if we are asked which states or territories(other than Laos, Cambodia or South Viet-Nam) we intend to designate under Article IV(i), wo should say that it is not ourpresent intention to designate any state or territory unless they so request.     This would leave it open to us to designateother states or territories later on if the circumstances seemto render it necessary or, as we hope, they ask for it themselyesa9.     In general, as regards the other Articles of the Treaty,the Americans and ourselves have been equally concerned not tobecome involved at this stage in any additional financial or military commitments,,10o    I would also draw attention to the fact that the Articledefining the Treaty area is so phrased as to est&amp;Lu&amp;e both Hong-Kong and Formosa.     I see no hope of persuading the United StatesGovernment to include Hong Kong alone.
(o211.   Besides the negotiation of tho Treaty, the ManilaConference will also have to consider whether any machinery should ho established, or specific measures taken, to giveeffect to tho provisions of tho Treaty.     The Council which isto ho established will be so organised as to meet at any time0This Council, which might require a small secretariat, should in my view bo located at Singapore, where the Commissioner-General could bo our permanent representative on it.     Neitherwe nor the Americans, however, envisage any more elaborateorganisation on the Worth Atlantic Treaty Organisation modeland I would propose to resist any suggestion for the appoint-ment of a Supremo Commander or a permanent Planning Staff.It would equally be undesirable to set up any economic organisation liable to duplicate the work of the Colombo Planmachinery and other existing agencies.     I hope tho existenceof the Treaty may make it easier for the United States Govern-ment to spend money in South-Bast Asia on measures calculated to increase the capacity of Asian Parties to the Treaty to resist attack or subversion, but I do not   envisage tho need,at this stage, for any corresponding commitments on the partof Her Majesty&apos;s Government.     Nor do I think it necessary orappropriate to earmark additional British armed forces for the specific purpose of fulfilling possible commitments arisingout of the Treaty.12.   Subject to the approval of the Cabinet, I accordinglypropose that the United Kingdom delegation to the ManilaConference should(a) negotiate a Treaty on the general lines indicated above(b) resist any proposals for tho establishmentof any more elaborate organisation thanthat contemplated above;(c) resist proposals for any specific financial or military commitments over and above those embodied in the Treaty itself0A.E.Foreign Office, S.V/o126th August, 195*4-*
