DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1954SECRET Copy No.C. (54) 29928th September, 1954. - cabinet anglo-EGYPTIAN negotiations memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsNegotiations have been in progress since the beginning of August for an Anglo-Egyptian Agreement based on the Heads of Agreement (Command Paper No. 9230)initialled in Cairo on 27th July.2.   The Agreement will fake the form of:  (i), a Main Agreement, with a short Preamble placing on record the desire ofthe two Governments to establish Anglo-Egyptian relations on a new basis of mutual understanding and firm friendship;. (ii) a number of Annexes.The Main Agreement will contain the most important provisions of the Heads ofAgreement, including an Article expressing the determination of both parties touphold the 1888 Convention on the Suez Canal.; There will be Annexes dealingwith the withdrawal of Her Majesty&apos;s Forces, the organisation of the Base, andfinancial matters, including the settlement of claims between the two Governments.These Annexes will be an integral part of the Agreement.     ; .3. There will be published Exchanges of Letters or Agreed Minutes dealingwith a number of points of detail. A published Agreed Minute will also record theunderstanding reached in Cairo at the time of the conclusion of the Heads ofAgreement that the Base will not be available for reactivation in the event of anattack on the Arab States by Israel.4. In addition to the published documents mentioned above, there will beunpublished Exchanges of Letters on matters of detail. These will concern the right of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to send a number of visiting inspectors tothe Base, in addition to those permanently attached to Her Majesty&apos;s Embassy; theinstructions to be given to the R.A.F. and the Egyptian Air Force in connexion withthe clearance of flights; and certain points in connexion with the transfer of the ownership of the Suez-Cairo oil pipe-line to Egypt.5. A good deal of progress has been made in drafting, but the Egyptians arebeing very difficult on a number of points.   The main one are the following:  (i) The Main Agreement. The Egyptians have declined to accept aratification clause, on the ground that this would give a dangerousperiod of delay before entry into force, which could be exploitedby troublemakers in Egypt. I consider that we are bound byprevious assurances to Parliament to ratify the Agreement, and it will benecessary to find some formula which takes account both of theEgyptian difficulties and of our own.Other points still under discussion are the formula for recording thetermination of the 1936 Treaty and the form of the Article onconsultation about the future during the last year of the Agreement.(ii) Inspectors. We have not yet reached agreement with the Egyptians aboutthe number of inspectors whom Her, Majesty&apos;s Government shall beentitled to have in the Base.(iii) Installations. The Egyptians have complained that the list of installationsto be handed over to them for upkeep is too short. Although we have come some way to meet them on this, they now argue that we should46868
be prepared to pay for the maintenance of certain items, including somehanded over to them at their request. They are also asking that weshould hand over to them a large part of the Headquarters&apos; area atMoascar. This raises difficulties, since the area contains niany of the amenities which are needed by the contractors.(iv) Transfer of Military Equipment. The Egyptians have asked for a gift of certain equipment for the local defence of airfields.(v) Status of the Contractors. There have been prolonged negotiations aboutlegal immunities for the contracting firms. This has not yet been finally settled.(vi) Claims. The Egyptian claims are very large, but over  50 millions ofthem arises out of the purported abrogation, which we do not recognise,of the 1936 Treaty. We also have large claims, and there is a roughbalance between the valid claims on each side. Our objective is to achieve a settlement under which each Government will waive itspast claims against the other. The Egyptians do not exclude this inprinciple, but, since their claims have been much publicised, theirprestige is to some extent involved in being able to show their own people that they have obtained some satisfaction. They have made itclear, therefore, that their agreement to the waiver is dependent on our meeting their requirements over the installations referred to at (iii)above.6. The Egyptians maintain that the opposition to the Agreement in Egyptis gathering strength and that there is a growing risk of acts of violence whichmay wreck the negotiations. They said at an earlier stage that they wished theAgreement to be signed before the students returned to the Universities on1st October. The reopening of the Universities has now been postponedindefinitely, but the Egyptians show no signs of making concessions in order toreach agreement. It is clear that there is an element of bluff in their attitude, andI consider that we ought to stand firm on the issues of real importance to us.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,27th September, 1954.
