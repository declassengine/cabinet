Pi &quot;3(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(54) 289 COPY NO. hS15th September, 1954CABINETCOMMONWEAJLTH PRIME MINISTERS&apos; MEETINGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations at the Prime Minister&apos;s request I circulate to the Cabinet a minuteI addressed to him suggesting a meeting of Commonwealth Prime ministers to be held in the latter part of January next.SWINTONCommonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1,14th September, 1954.SERIAL NO. 18/54PRIME minister in recent years it has been our aim to hold Meetings of commonwealth prime Ministers at intervals of about two years for a general exchange of views on matters of common interest, particularly on international affairs and related defence problems.    I have for some time been thinking about thedate for the next Meeting, and it seems to me that there is much in the stateof the world, including our latest thoughts on vitally important matters ofdefence policy, to justify such a Meeting of Prime Ministers during the comingwinte r.2.     The last Meeting was in June 1953 but, owing to the preoccupations ofthe Coronation period, it was of a briefer and more cursory nature than usual.    The Meeting before that was in November-December 1952: this was called an Economic Conference and was largely devoted to economic matters.Before that there was the Meeting held in January 1951.    It seems to metherefore that a Meeting fairly soon would be well timed.3.     There have been signs that other countries would welcome such aMeeting.    The Foreign Secretary has had oral indications to this effect fromMr. Casey, on behalf of Australia, and from the Indian representative atGeneva.    (The Indians have also mentioned the matter to our High Commiss-practitioner).    Though the Foreign Secretary, when he was in Ottawa, had to
discourage a Canadian proposal for an early meeting of CommonwealthForeign Ministers in India, it was clear (and has since been confirmed at theofficial level) that the Canadian Government would welcome some earlyCommonwealth Meeting.    In addition, the Pakistan Prime Minister spoke toour High Commissioner in May very strongly in favour of our taking theinitiative in calling an early Prime Ministers&apos; MIeeting, and I have alsomyself had enquiries from several High Commissioners.4.     Experience has shown that, unless some crisis makes it imperative,it is virtually impossible to find a date on which all Prime Ministers canattend other than in January (or possibly December).    Everything, therefore,seems to point towards trying for a Meeting in, say, January 1955.    Ifthis commends itself to you, it would not be too early to put the thought intothe minds of other Prime Ministers and ascertain their reactions.    I attachdraft telegrams which you might send to them.5.     The Foreign Secretary with whom I have spoken about the proposals is in agreement with it, and I am sending him a copy of this minute.(Signed) SWINTON13th September, 1954.DRAFT telegram to:  United Kingdom High Commissioner: OttawaCanberraW ellingtonPretoriaNew DelhiKarachiColomboRepeated       SalisburyPlease communicate to Prime Minister at earliest convenientmoment message from Prime Minister contained in my immediatelysucceeding telegram regarding Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.Please repeat telegrams on this subject to other High Commissioners(including Salisbury) until arrangements for Meeting have taken shape.
IIS&quot;Following is text of personal message from Prime Minister forPrime Minister.    Begins.I feel the time has come for us to consider arranging anotherPrime Ministers&apos; Meeting.    Much has happened since we last met and therewould be great advantage in taking counsel together again.    There is theproblem of our future relations with Communism both in Europe and Asia.There are the awe-inspiring prospects thrown up by the latest potentialities of atomic weapons.    There is the constant need to safeguard as best wecan the peace of our peoples.    On all these - and other topics - I am surewe could have a fruitful meeting and one which might give some guidance toa troubled world.2.      It is never easy to find a date convenient to all, but past experience has shown that January is the most generally acceptable time for a meeting,and this would be convenient to me.    I should therefore like to suggest thatwe should aim at having such a meeting in London during the second half ofJanuary of next year.3.     I hope you will share my feeling and I should be grateful if you would let me know whether my proposal commends itself to you and, if so, whether you would find the date convenient.    I would then let you and the otherPrime Ministers have more precise proposals.    We would, of course, hopethat you and your party would be the guests of the United Kingdom Governmentfor the period of the meeting.4.      The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland has succeeded to southern Rhodesia&apos;s position and has an interest in the matters which we shallbe discussing.    I should therefore propose to send an invitation toSir Godfrey Huggins to be present as on previous occasions.5.     You will,T am sure, agree that the fact that the possibility of anearly meeting is under consideration should be treated with the greatestsecrecy at this stage, and that there should be no publicity.    If my proposalcommends itself generally, we can consult together at the appropriate timeabout an announcement.    Ends.To:  United Kingdom High Commissioner:  OttawaCanadaWellingtonPretoriaNew DelhiKarachiColomboRepeated Salisbury-
