confidential. (54) 29724th September, 1954CABINETCYPRUSNote by the Secretary of State for the colonies attach for the information of my colleagues a Progress Report by the CyprusCommittee, of which the chairman is the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs.2. Since this report was prepared I understand that at the United nations the General (Steering) Committee have decided to recommend to the general assembly that Cyprus should be inscribed on its agenda. The votes were ninein favour with three against and three abstentions, including the United States.A. L.-B.Colonial Office, S.W.1,23rd September, 1954.Copy No.6546854aPrinted for the Cabinet.

PROGRESS REPORTOn 27th August the Cabinet appointed the Committee to consider the presentation of Government policy towards Cyprus (C.C. (54) 57th Conclusions,Minute 6). The Committee has tackled this task in three main ways; it hasassessed overseas reactions to United Kingdom policy towards Cyprus; it hasexamined the nature of the United Kingdom case and considered appropriateforms in which it could be presented to different publics; and it has arranged forspecial publicity measures to be taken. The following paragraphs summarise theprogress which has been made in each of these fields.Overseas Reactions to the United Kingdom policy . In the Commonwealth the Cyprus issue has not yet aroused any greatpublic interest. Reaction in the &quot; old &quot; Commonwealth countries showed thatthe main publicity requirements were to clarify our attitude towards the press in cyprus, and our long-term policy with regard to the political and constitutionalfuture of the island, and that a restatement of the strategic aspect would also be useful. In the Asian Commonwealth countries interest has so far been slight,and High Commissioners recommended against stirring up interest by publicity.The requirement was to be ready with material for use in these countries whenthe issue came to the forefront in New York.3. The reactions of the Commonwealth Governments have on the wholebeen helpful. Canada and New Zealand do not fully accept our interpretation of Article 2 (7) of the Charter and therefore have doubts about the propriety ofopposing inscription. The views of India and Pakistan on the right of the united nations to intervene in matters of domestic jurisdiction (especially on colonial affairs) normally run even more directly counter to our own. Nevertheless, therehas been an encouraging degree of general sympathy with our attitude towardsthe merits of the case. Australia and South Africa are entirely with us in opposinginscription. Canada and New Zealand are impressed with the political and strategic arguments against the discussion of this item in the Assembly and canbe counted on at least to abstain on the issue of inscription. The Government ofIndia have indicated that they intend to be as helpful to the United KingdomGovernment as possible in the Assembly, and the Government of Pakistan havemade it clear that they intend to give us full support.4. In foreign countries there has been little public comment, except in theUnited States of America and, of course, in Greece and Turkey. Americancomment has been on the whole unfavourable but not violently so. On the purelypolitical side sympathy lies with the Greeks, but commentators generally havetaken the line that the strategic argument had prior importance. Points forstressing which have emerged are strategic considerations, the Communist menaceand the Turkish view.5. The general reaction of foreign Governments which have been approachedin connection with the United Nations has been more sympathetic than mighthave been expected having regard to the fact that Cypriots are being deniedultimate self-determination. It seems likely that the majority of States will, ifCyprus comes up for debate, be at least reluctant to speak against the UnitedKingdom. But few countries accept our interpretation of Article 2 (7) of the charter, and some who would otherwise wish to support us will find it difficultto oppose inscription. The chances of the General Committee recommendingagainst inscription are about even. In plenary session of the General assembly the outlook is bleaker. The United States and two Latin Americans are amongthe five doubtfuls on the General Committee. As the Latin Americans willprobably follow the United States, the United States effectively hold the key andthey have now informed us that they are likely to abstain from voting oninscription. It is still hoped to induce them to change their decision and vote against inscription.Nature and Appropriateness of the United Kingdom case6. The Committee found that the publiqity which was being given to theUnited Kingdom case was based on the following arguments:  (i) Strategic: that Cyprus is vital to the United Kingdom strategically andthat a base there is essential to the security of the United Kingdom,46854
the Commonwealth and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation-       (N.A.T.O.). V-.: : .-ft    :.    v:(ii) Historical: that legally the United Kingdom case is beyond, dispute, thatCyprus has never belonged to Greece and that Turkey and the Turkishminority oppose enosis. \  ;(hi) Constitutional: that Cyprus has been offered a constitution and has a.     well-developed system of local government. . -(iv) Communist threat:   that there is a threatening and well-organisedCommunist minority in Cyprus, which is the main reason, why themore liberal constitution offered in 1948 has been replaced by a lessliberal one.(v) Material well-being: that the Cypriots are far better off materially underthe present administration than are comparable communities underGreek rule.(vi) Anti-sedition laws:   that the reason why the warning was given that existing laws about sedition would be more strictly enforced was to counter misrepresentation from supporters of enosis and Communists;and that these laws are less stringent than comparable Greek laws.7. The Committee examined these arguments and embellished them indetail, but recognised that some were likely to be more effective than others andthat emphasis must vary with the audience addressed. The strategic and theCommunist arguments were considered to be of particular importance, particularlyin order to influence United States opinion. Accordingly, with the approval of theChiefs of Staff, a restatement of the strategic case has been prepared whichemphasises the vital military need for the United Kingdom to retain administrativecontrol of Cyprus. A popular version of this will be given wide publicity and thefull case is being sent to President Eisenhower, the United States and CanadianChiefs of Staff and to the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. The nature ofthe Communist threat is also being worked up, to emphasise particularly the links between the Cypriot Communists and the Iron Curtain countries and the purelydisruptive and cynical nature of the Communist support of enosis. On the historical side it is clear that the demand for enosis in Cyprus itself is to-day nostronger and probably far less strong than it was 70 years ago.* 8. On the other hand, it was thought that the presentation of theconstitutional and material well-being arguments had in some cases been less effective; it may be true that &quot;you cannot counter Nationalist propaganda bypraising the drains,&quot; but this does not mean that the benefits brought by british administration should not be forcefully stated as opportunity offers. In Cyprusitself, it was suggested that a strong case might be made to show that there was more liberty for the individual under British rule than there would be under Greekas well as fewer liabilities, e.g., he was free from the obligation to perform militaryservice. To use this argument elsewhere would embarrass us, as it would involvecriticism of the extent of personal liberty in the territory of one of our north atlantic Treaty allies. But if it were effective in reducing the pressure for enosisin Cyprus itself our case would be greatly strengthened, and the Governor is considering making use of it. It was agreed that efforts should be made to influenceopinion in Cyprus through the Cypriot community in London, who could stand to lose if enosis were realised.9. In the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth countries much of the criticism of our policies has arisen from misunderstanding of the decision to enforce the anti-sedition laws. So far there have been no prosecutions under these a situation contrasting with that in Greece-and it is hoped that this calm willcontinue at least until the question is clear of the United Nations. Meanwhile,every effort is being made to emphasise that these laws are not new and not peculiar to Cyprus.10. A further argument which is being developed is to expose the role&apos;ofthe Greek Orthodox Church in the enOsis agitations, lest, particularly in anglo-Saxon countries, this appears to lend respectability to the issue. Apamphlet on the political influence of the Greek Orthodox Church in Cyprus hasbeen given a wide circulation, and further details which have been received fromthe Governor about its less creditable activities are being appropriately used.
Special publicity measures11. Although extensive publicity was already being given to the UnitedKingdom case it was decided, as a result of the work of the Committee, that further special measures should be adopted.  These are: (i) The Minister of State for Colonial Affairs is now visiting the UnitedStates, and attending the first part of the United Nations Assembly.He is co-ordinating and focusing our publicity there.(ii) Particular attention is being paid to the Press correspondents in London.The Secretary of State for the Colonies, at a lunch of theCommonwealth Press Association on 21st September, brought out some useful points, on Cyprus, to which publicity can be given. TheMinister of State for Colonial Affairs has met the majorCommonwealth correspondents privately and has discussed Cyprus ata Press conference with United States Press representatives.(iii) The delegation of Turkish Cypriots who are now visiting the UnitedKingdom are receiving particular attention.(iv) Arrangements have been made to enable military correspondents inLondon to prepare articles on the strategic case for United Kingdomretention of Cyprus.(v) The Governor of Cyprus has accepted a temporary Press adviser with united Nations and United States experience.(vi) The Head of the Information Department of the Colonial Office, who hasattended the Committee&apos;s meetings, is visiting Cyprus for about a week from 21st September, when Cyprus will be under discussion at theUnited Nations.12. The Committee will continue to receive reports from overseas onreactions to our policy. It will watch the situation carefully and will direct its activities promptly to take advantage of any developments.
