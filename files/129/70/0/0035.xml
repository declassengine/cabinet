joMemorandum by the Minister of Fuel and PowerTwo months ago when I obtained authority for an import of 1-J million tons of coal, I warned the Cabinet thatthe gap between supply and demand might turn out to be 2,3 or more million tons, and in that event that we shouldhave to import more coal.2.     Arrangements have now been made for the import ofli million tons together, by arrangement with the Chancellorwith another ^ million tons;    but, as I feared, this willnot be enough.3.     The increase in industrial activity and therefore in home coal consumption has accelerated, and the decline in coal mining man-power and in opencast coal output hascontinued.     The miners are not doing badly (indeed output per man shift is likely this year to reach an all timerecord) but the strong competition for labour from otherindustries, particularly in Yorkshire and the west midlands, where miners are specially needed, is causing the industry to lose men.h-.     If nothing further is done we shall be faced witha decline in coal stocks during the winter to the level which gave rise to the Shinwell crisis in 19h7.      Theposition is illustrated in the attached graph.5*     On the assumption of a normal winter, we need to import another 2 million tons if we are to avoid difficulty:if the winter were severe we would need h million tons.I propose that we should at once decide to import2 million tons,and consider not later than the middle ofOctober whether further measures are necessary.      I have discussed these matters with the Chancellor and he agrees with the action now proposed.SEC RETCOPY7th September. 19,^hCABINETCOAL IMPORTSG.L.Ministry of Fuel and Power.7th September, I95h-
LEVEL OF DISTRIBUTED   COAL STOCKS, MAY, 1952 - APRIL.T955the curve for 1954/55 is drawn on the assumption that theauthority    for   imports   remains at two   million tons.if a further   two million  tons were authorised, the   normal weather curve would not go below line AB (i.e.the minimum safelevel for end-winter stocks)j    the cold weather curve would cut AB at(X) and CD (the breakdown level) at(Y).iii.stock levels in the area bounded by ABCD would give rise to tincreasing difficulties in distribution and complaint from thepublic and industry; levels below CD would result in tbreakdown. (note: CD is equivalent to million ton stock rlevel at end december, 1846, which was followed, first, by the rcuts on industrial coal, and later by stoppage of electricity, which led to the unemployment of two million workers and the&quot;loss  of 1200 million   export trade). -_i._l._L_....;----X-:.A......---1---
