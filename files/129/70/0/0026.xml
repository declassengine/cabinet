C.(54) 27627th August, 1954CABINETALTERNATIVES TO THE EUROPEAN DEFENCE community memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe French Prime Minister warned the Prime Minister and myself on 23rd August that the European Defence Community (E.D.C.)Treaty would in his view certainly be rejected by the French Assemblyearly next week.    On the other hand, he was quite definite at Brusselsand at Chartwell that Western unity must be maintained and that earlysteps must be taken to ensure German association with the West.    Wespoke in very general terms of German entry into the North atlantic treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) and also of a six-Power organisation,looser than the E.D.C., with which the United Kingdom could be associated.As a first and immediate step he declared he was prepared to join withthe United Kingdom and the U.S.A. in bringing the Bonn Conventions intoforce.    As my colleagues will be aware from the Minister of State&apos;s paper(C. (54) 231) of 13th July an Anglo-American plan for this has beenprepared and can be discussed at once with the French and then with theGermans.    The outstanding issue discussed in paragraph 5 of that paper has since been satisfactorily resolved.2. The problem of a German defence contribution other thanthrough E.D.C. is more difficult.    The preparatory work done in theForeign Office in recent months in consultation with the Ministry ofDefence and the Treasury on this problem has shown that there is no easyor ideal solution.    Probably the best alternative for the United kingdom would be the entry of the Federal Republic into N.A.T.O. with as many ofthe E.D.C. safeguards as possible.    Those we might try to obtain are setout in the Annex, which has been communicated to the United StatesGovernment as a study paper.    They have not yet commented.    while there is, I hope, a chance of obtaining some or all of these safeguards inreturn for German entry into what is the best Western club, I am by nomeans sure that Dr. Adenauer can in fact accept so much discrimination in 1954.    We have also been advised that, despite M. Mendes-France&apos;sbrave words at Chartwell, the French Parliament might oppose Germanentry into N.A.T.O.    There will also be difficulties in this country, whereGerman rearmament has only been accepted within the E.D.C. framework.The Americans have also hitherto been lukewarm,    Their reasons are,I think, threefold:-(i) they have wanted the E.D.C. to hold thefield alone;(ii) they fear a French veto after further delay; and1The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No..........
(iii)  they would find difficulty in accepting themselvesthose modifications in the structure of N.A.T.O.which would provide safeguards on german rearmament without discrimination againstGermanyThe first of these objections would disappear with the collapse of theE.D.C.;  the second remains at best an open question.    The third objectionremains.    But, as I shall explain below, there may be a way round it.On balance, I think that N.A.T.O. is the best solution, provided its nego-negotiation does not cuase too much delay.    We can also remind president eisenhower of his statement to the Prime Minister and myself in washington in June that, if the French did not proceed with the E.D.C.,they must be confronted with the choice of having Germany in N.A.T.O.3. Before  however  we proceed too far on this course and are committed to a tripartite policy with the Americans and the French, wemust be sure that it is acceptable to Dr. Adenauer.    We should thereforeconsult Dr. Adenauer very shortly after an unfavourable French vote on theE.D.C.    We could invite him to London, but this might arouse too muchspeculation at an early stage in our difficult task.    Alternatively, we couldconsult him through the High Commissioner in Bonn or through some special emissary.    We must also be sure that the Americans support usin trying to get the necessary safeguards, and we should therefore press for their early views on the suggestions in the Annex.4. The other alternative we have considered is the so-calledEuropean solution under which we would join a modified E.D.C. still withinthe N.A.T.O. framework.    In principle this is probably the solution most acceptable to the French, although no one has yet been able to get round the difficulty of tying down the Germans while leaving the other partiesrelatively free.    We had considered that the French, and indeed the other  .D.C. countries, would require of us more far-reaching commitmentsthan we have hitherto felt able to give.    It seems at least problematicalwhether the five E.D.C. countries, some of whom really prefer the N.A.T.O.solution, and all of whom refused M. Mende s-France&apos;s proposals in brussels, would agree to British entry on terms which fall far short even of M. Mendes-France&apos;s proposals.     We had felt that the minimumcommitments likely to be required of us would be a fixed contribution of forces and a fixed share in a common armaments programme, neither ofwhich could be changed without the consent of the other member-States.There might also be pressure upon us to do even more and to commit theUnited Kingdom strategic bomber force and metropolitan fighter force tothe Community and also to share with our European partners atomic andthermo-nuclear secrets, with obviously prejudicial results upon ourpresent special relationship with the U.S.A. and Canada in this field,    Afurther argument against such a European solution is that it would probablyweaken the existing structure of N.A.T.O., imposing a strain upon ourrelations with such other members as Norway.    More important, it mightweaken our links with tho United States and encourage the trend in Americatowards &quot;peripheral defence&quot;.    Finally, such a grouping would be much less powerful to contain Germany than N.A.T.O. with America and Canadapresent.5, M. Mendes-France referred very briefly at Chartwell to a rather different &quot;European&quot; solution which, if our information from otherFrench sources is correct, would amount to no more than the six E.D.C.Powers maintaining the armaments pool provided in the E.D.C. Treaty underthe general political control of a Council of Ministers of the six Powers,with the addition of a United Kingdom Minister with equal rights.    This
1Z,would all be within the N.A.T.O. framework.    M. Mendes-France was notvery clear whether Germany would at the same time become a full memberof N.A.T.O.    If indeed this is all which would be asked of us there would clearly.be no difficulty for us from the supranational point of view.But, as in the case of the E.D.C., we should probably find that we were askedfor further and further concessions and, when we reached our limit, weshould be held responsible for any breakdown.    Such a scheme, moreover,would permit a German national army and a German General Staff, withthe safeguards listed in the Annex restricted only to the armaments pool.This would, I fear, be unacceptable to wide sections of public opinion inthis country.    Nor do I see the Germans readily accepting even the armaments pool restrictions which in fact, although not in theory,discriminate against Germany, except possibly as part of a wider scheme in which they became full members of N.A.T.O.6. Another idea which has been mentioned and for which militaryadvantages are claimed is that of a triangular United Kingdom/United States/German alliance super-imposed upon N.A.T.O.    It is at least preferable to a direct United States/German alliance and clearly we cannot allow theshortcomings of the French Assembly to block all progress in europe and to lose Germany for the West.    But I see the gravest political objections to such an alignment except for the limited purposes and in thedifferent form suggested below.    Quite apart from French opposition,which might extend to French defection from N.A.T.O. with disastrousmilitary consequences for the whole N.A.T.O. defence system, british public opinion would, I think, reject any such alignment.7. While I should welcome the views of my colleagues on this verydifficult problem, I cannot myself see any better policy than that of bringingGermany into N.A.T.O., in agreement with France and the United States,with the safeguards set out in the Annex.    We could, I think, count uponthe strong support of all the members of N.A.T.O. , other than France, andthe question could be discussed at an emergency meeting of the north atlantic Council, as Mr. Dulles has already proposed.8. We have heard that the Americans may have an alternative plan for obtaining the safeguards, not through a revision of the N.A.T.O,structure affecting all the N.A.T.O. partners alike, but through an outsideagreement between Germany and the present Occupation Powers.     Thiswould probably involve giving the Germans special guarantees as aquid pro quo for the safeguards.    But these could be a simple repetition of the assurances which the three Powers have already given to theFederal Republic and Berlin.9. If the price of French acquiescence in such a N.A.T.O, planwere our agreement to sit with the six E.D.C. Powers in a political Councilof Ministers to control a six-Power armaments pool on the E.D.C. model,and provided this did not involve us in unacceptable commitments, I think we could agree.    This would in effect be much less than we have already undertaken towards the E.D.C.10. On balance our best bet is German entry into N.A.T.O. with the safeguards in the Annex.    I must however warn my colleagues that thispolicy, with or without the additions mentioned in paragraphs 8 and 9 above,will not be easy to realise.    We shall moreover have to act quickly if weare not to lose Germany.    The machinery for working out the plan wouldrequire   -(a)  immediate consultation with the Americans;
73(b) separate and early consultation withdraw. Adenauer and with the French;(c) a meeting at some stage of the six E.D.C.Powers, with the United States and theUnited Kingdom; and(d) an emergency meeting of the North atlantic council, when some plan had been prepared.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.26th August, 1954.ANNEXRestrictions on German rearmament which might be feasible in the event of German admission to N.A.T.O.(United Kingdom Working paper)Public opinion in France and other N.A.T.O. countries willnot readily accept German membership of N.A.T.O. without somerestrictions on German rearmament.    Those restrictions, if they are tobe acceptable to German opinion, must not discriminate too obviously-against the Germans and must apply to other countries as well.    the ideal solution would be to transplant to N.A.T.O. as many of the essentialE.D.C. safeguards as we can persuade the Germans to accept as the priceof joining the leading Western &quot;club&quot; as a full member.We might aim at agreements on the following subjects:-(a) Germany&apos;s initial contributionThe size and character of the initial German defence con-tribution to N.A.T.O. would be agreed with the Federal Republic as part ofthe negotiations for her admission to N.A.T.O.    It would be based on theE.D.C. figures of twelve divisions and 1,300 aircraft.    It would compriseneither submarines nor strategic bombers.    The agreement might include a clause to the effect that any change in the composition or strength ofthe German contribution could only be made in consultation with the north atlantic Council (i. e. through the Annual Review process) and in accord-ance with agreed NoA,T.0. strategy.(b) Strategically exposed areasA protocol might be added to the North Atlantic Treaty to reproduce the E.D.C. agreement that within &quot;strategic areas&quot; certain types of arms production and research, including atomic and the r mo-nuclear weapons, submarines and military aircraft, would only be permitted by decision of the North Atlantic Council.    In order to avoid obvious dis-crimination against the Germans it will probably be necessary to define
7^as &quot;strategic areas&quot; not only the Federal Republic but also parts of theN.A.T.O. area also contiguous or nearly contiguous to the Soviet &quot;empire&quot;such as N. Norway, Denmark,Thrace and Turkey north of the Straits.(c) A European arms poolA European arms pool would have political and psychologicalvalue.    The six E.D.C. countries might adopt within N.A.T.O.:  a plan foran arms pool, incorporating the essential features of the relevant pro-visions of the E.D.C. Treaty (i.e. control over production, import and export of war material).    The drafting of the plan for such an arms poolwould have to be left primarily to the E.D.C. countries.(d) Commitment of forces to N.A.T.O.In order to prevent Germany from maintaining forces otherthan those committed to N.A.T.O., an agreement might be concluded between all members of N.A.T.O, on the lines of Articles 9, 10 and 11 of the E.D.C.Treaty.     Thus N.A.T.O. members might agree that apart from forcesplaced under SACEUR no armed forces will be maintained except:(i)  police and gendarmerie intended for the maintenanceof internal order;(ii) troops for the personal protection of the Head ofState;(iii) forces required for international missions (e.g. theUnited Nations Organisation) or for any other purpose approved by the North Atlantic council(iv)  forces which any member required to fulfil itsdefence responsibilities in the North atlantic area other than the European mainland or outside the NA.T.O. area.(e) Integration and deployment of N.A.T.O. forces(i) Measures might be taken to give effect to what is already agreed to be SACEUR&apos;s first responsibility, namely, the creation of a genuine and effective integrated force, notably in the air, so that all german air units could be grouped with other nationalities in N.A.T.O. airformations.(ii) The position of Western Germany in the centre of theN.A.T.O. front line, coupled with the obvious temptation for German forces to cross the Zonal frontier to assist their compatriots in the Soviet Zone oreven later on to modify the Oder-Neisse frontier, make it essential toestablish effective N.A.T.O. control over the location and movement of theGerman forces.    We can reasonably expect the Germans to agree, as theUnited Kingdom and the United States agreed in the recent Declarationsabout the E.D.C., that their forces shall be deployed in accordance withagreed N.A.T.O. strategy.    In addition, it might be agreed that national forces placed under SACEUR shall not be moved within the N.A.T.O, areanor revert to national control for use within the N.A.T.O. area without theconsent of SACEUR and the North Atlantic Council.    We could not in thecase of Germany allow a repetition of the Italian action in September, 1953in sending troops and ships to the Yugoslav frontier without any consultationwith N.A.T.O.    The presence of allied forces inGermany would of course be an additional and effective safeguard.-5-
(f) Maintenance of United States and United kingdom troops in europe to supplement these suggested measures of control probably the most satisfying assurance that could be given to the French (particularly from the psychological point of view) would be some guarantee of thecontinued presence of United Kingdom and United States forces on theContinent.    Their presence would be essential in connection with, e. g.paragraph (e)(i) above.     The United Kingdom and the United States havealready stated, in connection with their proposed links with E.D.C., their intention to keep on the Continent their fair share of forces required for european defence as long as the threat exists.    New declarations on similar lines might be made by both Governments.(g) Extending the duration of the North Atlantic TreatyAn additional reassurance to the French (which would be particularly effective if guarantees as envisaged in paragraph (f) above were given) would be the addition of a protocol to the North Atlantic treaty to remove the possibility of denunciation before fifty years.     The idea that the Treaty should be considered of indefinite duration has alreadybeen ventilated in the North Atlantic Council and in a broad sense approved.A legal life of fifty years might greatly help to reconcile public opinion to German rearmament.    This provision might be included in the protocolinviting German accession to N.A.T.O.(h) German assurance against any attempt to modifyexisting frontiers by forceOne of the main objections to German admission to N.A.T.O.is undoubtedly the fact that the Federal Republic (and probably a futurereunited Germany) would be a territorially dissatisfied Power, under constant temptation to modify its Eastern frontiers by force and to dragthe whole of the N.A.T.O, Alliance into war for that purpose.     this objection is a real one and cannot be completely met.    But we should atleast require the German Federal Republic to make the type of declaration(suitably amended to meet the altered circumstances) which Dr. Adenauerlast December agreed to make over the proposed security guarantees tobe offered to the Russians in connection with the entry into force of theE.D.C.    This would be buttressed by a version of the accompanyingstatement by the three &quot;Western Powers amended to take account of the new situation and to include all other N.A.T.O. Powers.
