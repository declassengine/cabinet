The cireulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP secret copy No...^7C.(54) 29216th September, 1954CABINETSCAMPTON AIRFIELDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for air on 17th March the Cabinet considered my proposal to developScampton Airfield in Lincolnshire as a medium bomber base (C. C. (54) 20thConclusions, Minute 2), and:-(i)     agreed that the normal procedure for consultation onthe development of Scampton Airfield should go forward;(ii)     agreed to resume their consideration of this projectwhen these consultations had been completed.2.        The Government Departments concerned have accepted thescheme, although the Ministry of Transport stipulate that a diversionbe provided before Ermine Street is closed at the point where the extended runway will cross it.    We propose to do this.3.        Twelve Class I airfields in all are required for the mediumbomber force.    The recent Committee on Defence Policy consideredthat the number of bombers now ordered would call for the develop-ment of that number of airfields because of the importance ofdispersal.4.        Each Class I airfield must have a concrete runway 9,000 ft.long and a clear overshoot of 1,000 ft. at each end.    The airfieldshould be more than 30 miles from the coast to lessen the risk ofsneak attacks.    It should be within reach of the main oil pipe lines and one of the main supply depots.    It must not interfere with the traffic circuit of other operational airfields.    It is most desirable thatit should take the minimum amount of land when extended.    It ischeaper to develop an existing airfield which already has goodpermanent buildings.5.        The number of airfields which meet these requirements isvery few.    Some of the best have already been developed for theUnited States Air Force.6.        I have examined this matter in great detail with the considerations which I have set out above in mind.1
7.        At Annex 1,1 have set out a schedule showing separately-Class I airfields - (a) already developed, (b) under construction, and(c) proposed for development.    In each case I have shown the estimatedcost and the amount of new land needed.C.        There are no other airfields capable of being developed tothe required standards which would not cost a great deal more money,either because they would need more development or because their use would mean developing other airfields at great expense, in additionto the cost of their own development.9.        I have considered most carefully the objections raised bylocal interests and in particular those of the County Council, theLincoln City Council, the Welton Rural District Council and the borough of Scunthorpe.    My Parliamentary Under-Secretary has received adeputation representing these interests.10.      I have as well taken into account the strong representations made by the Lord Privy Seal both verbally and in correspondence.11.      I am afraid that in this Island a defence work of this charactercannot fail to injure some amenities and that strong local objectionmust naturally be aroused wherever it is carried out.1Z. With great regret, I have concluded that I cannot, consistent with my responsibilities for air defence and with a proper regard forthe public purse, make any alternative proposal.13.      Accordingly I ask the Cabinet to approve my proposals forthe development of Scampton Airfield.D.L.D.Air Ministry, S.W.1.16th September, 1954.
