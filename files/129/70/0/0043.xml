confidential.(54) 29318th September, 1954CABINETPACIFIC CHARTERMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe recent Manila Conference drew up, in addition to the SouthEast Asia. Collective Defence Treaty, a declaration of principles to be known as the Pacific Charter.    The final text of this document is annexed.2.        The proposal for the Charter came from the Philippine Governmentand was first made only after the Conference had assembled in Manila.This meant that some Delegations, including the United Kingdom Delegation;had little time to consult their Governments and secure their approval tothe final text before signature.    Lord Reading accordingly decided notto sign but simply to initial the document ad referendum.    The Delegationsof France, Australia and New Zealand did likewise.3.        It will now be necessary for instructions to sign the Charter onbehalf of the United Kingdom to be sent to H. M. Ambassador at Manila.The document in its original form contained a number of features whichwould have been unacceptable to the United Kingdom.    But I am satisfiedthat, in the form in which it finally emerged as the result of discussions with the Asian countries concerned during an adjournment of theConference, it adds nothing to the existing commitments of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment as contained in the United Nations Charter and the South east asia Collective Defence Treaty.    There is no doubt that the asian countries represented at Manila attached great importance to the charter and a most unfortunate impression would be created if we were now to fail to put our signature to it.    I accordingly propose to send thenecessary instructions to H. M. Ambassador.COPY NO.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.17th September, 1954.
