History and Constitution1. From the time they were established in 1833, the Crown Agents have hadno formal constitution. They exist under the Royal Prerogative. no statutory authority has governed them; their status and functions have never been closely defined nor has the extent and nature of Ministerial responsibilityfor them. They have never been a Department of the United KingdomGovernment.2. 1833 was the year in which two &quot;Joint Agents General for crown colonies &quot; were appointed to look after the financial and supply needs inLondon of thirteen British Colonies, which had up till then been met byseparate agencies. Regulations made by the Secretary of State instructedColonial Governments to use the services of the Crown Agents for all their business in London, and the costs of the office were met from the funds ofthose Governments; United Kingdom funds were not involved. For over a century the Crown Agents have charged fees for their services to the overseas governments and public authorities who are their Principals.3. The United Kingdom Government did however recognise a responsibilityfor supervising the operations of the Crown Agents. Until 1880 this respon-sibility was exercised by the Treasury, and from 1880 to 1961 by the ColonialOffice. In 1961 it was transferred to the Department of Technical Co-operation,which was later absorbed into the Ministry of Overseas Development.4. In 1863 the title was changed to &quot; Crown Agents for the Colonies &apos;*, andin 1880 the Secretary of State laid down that they should act only on behalf of dependent territories. This excluded Colonies which attained responsible government. With the single exception of Iraq (for special reasons) the CrownAgents did not act for any independent government until after the second world War. At that time the 1880 ruling ceased to be applied, because manyof the former dependent territories which were then securing their independencewished nevertheless to go on using the services of the Crown Agents. Theirtitle was changed in 1954 to the present &quot; Crown Agents for Oversea Govern-ments and Administrations &quot; and they now act for some 100 governments and200 other public authorities, the great majority in independent countries; andalso for a number of international organisations.5. Despite the lack of a formal constitution, certain basic principles havebeen recognised as applying:(a) they exist to serve their overseas Principals;(b) they are financed by the charges they make in respect of their services to those Principals, and not by the United Kingdom Government;(c) although they are a Crown body, they are not a Department of theUnited Kingdom Government; and(cQthey are subject to directions from the responsible Minister, and parliament is entitled to review their operations.,5
6. In 1909 a Parliamentary Committee of Enquiry concluded that the CrownAgents were officers of the Crown, and more particularly of the Crown ColonyGovernments, and as such were bound to carry out the instructions of those governments and of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that theywere to be regarded as analogous to the then India Office, which was organised on the lines of the Home Civil Service but paid for from the funds of theGovernment of India.7. During the period when the Crown Agents acted only on behalf of colonial governments, the Colonial Secretary exercised supervision in the light of hisoverall responsibility for those Governments. Now that most of the Principalsare independent Governments or administrations, oversight has come to beexercised on a different and less detailed basis. The constitutional relationship between the responsible Minister and the Crown Agents remains the same;the Ministers power of direction, deriving from the Royal Prerogative, remainscomprehensive, if undefined; he still appoints the Crown Agents themselves andreceives their annual accounts. They in turn are generally responsible to theMinister. But in the light of the changed status of most of the Principals therehas been a gradual relaxation of control over their activities, especially asregards their charges, and their taking on new Principals. The practice ofnon-intervention by United Kingdom Ministers in relations between the CrownAgents and their overseas Principals was re-affirmed by the then Minister of overseas Development in statements to Parliament on 31 July 1974 and18 December 1974.Organisation8. The number of Crown Agents has varied over the years from four downto one. From 1972 to 1974 there was only one, who was known as theChairman of the Crown Agents. He was assisted by an informal Board,originally set up in 1965, on which were six &quot; directors &quot; who were seniormembers of the staff supervising one or more departments. On 1 October 1974the present Chairman and Senior Crown Agent, Mr J G Cuckney, was appointed on a full-time basis. Since then six other Crown Agents have been appointed on a part-time basis, one of whom has been designated Deputy Chairman. Allare remunerated from the Crown Agents&apos; own funds. With the Chairman,they constitute the present Board of Crown Agents, and formulate policywithin the bounds of such directives as may be issued by the Minister for overseas Development. Below the main Board there is also an executive board of full-time officials, chaired by the Senior Crown Agent, which is responsible for the implementation of policy.9. The permanent staff of the Crown Agents in Britain and in a number of offices overseas number some 2,000. They are Crown servants but not civilservants. In addition there are a substantial number of staff overseas on short-term contracts.10. The Crown Agents have formed a number of wholly-owned companies to provide services which it was not possible for them to provide directlybecause of their unincorporated status. The directors and senior staff of these companies were for the most part seconded from the Crown Agents&apos; office.
The companies are:Four Millbank Nominees Ltd formed as a non-trading company in 1963 toprovide a nominee service for the large number of stocks and shares whichthe Crown Agents hold on behalf of Principals. It was subsequentlyalso used for transactions carried out on behalf of the Crown Agentsthemselves;Four Millbank Holdings Ltd formed in 1971 to act as a holding company for the Crown Agents&apos; wholly owned companies other than the nomineecompany;Four Millbank Investments Ltd formed in 1963 as Four Millbank UnitTrust Fund Managers Ltd as a vehicle for investment management onbehalf of Principals. In the event, the company was never used for thispurpose but was renamed Four Millbank Investments Ltd in 1967 and used to hold Crown Agents own account equity investments. In August1974 it transferred its medium to long term investments to a separate newsubsidiary company, Four Millbank Securities Ltd retaining only its shortterm investments;Millbank Technical Services Ltd formed in 1967 to enable the CrowoAgents&apos; organisation to offer a number of associated services outside their traditional agency role. Unlike the Crown Agents this company canenter into contracts in its own name for the supply of equipment, theprovision of services, project management and related matters.FunctionsII. The Crown Agents provide financial, professional, technical and com-mercial services for their Principals in the public sector. The Principalscomprise:(a) Governments of British dependencies and Associated States;(b) Governments of independent countries;(c) Intergovernmental organisations;(d) Public corporations and authorities overseas;(e) Departments of the United Kingdom Government;if) Other public sector bodies^ international or British; and(g) Charitable organisations.They may not act for individuals or for private sector bodies other thancharitable organisations.12. The services provided include:(i) buying, shipping and insuring stores, materials, plant and equipment of all kinds; and their technical inspection;(ii) professional and technical advice and practical assistance particularlyin connection with engineering matters including supervision and management of projects, and supply and materials managementmatters;(iii) managing investment funds for Principals ;
(iv) accepting funds in various currencies deposited by Principals;(v) making miscellaneous payments for Principals; -(vi) where appropriate, financial facilities to Principals in connection withtheir use of the Crown Agents&apos; other services;(vii) acting as Registrar for Principals&apos; public sterling loans, and managingfor them other loan raising and servicing operations;(viii) purchasing on behalf of Principals real property, and related propertymanagement and advisory services;(ix) negotiating on behalf of Principals contracts for the design, securityprinting and supply of currency notes and postage stamps, minting ofcoins, and sales of postage stamps and coins for collectors;(x) personnel services for Principals, such as recruitment of staff, bookingsea and air passages, payment of salaries and pensions and manage-ment of pensions schemes and funds.13. In addition, the Crown Agents themselves, or through Millbank TechnicalServices Ltd, provide such services as training facilities and consultancies for overseas Governments and administrations. The work which they do asagents on behalf of United Kingdom Departments is mainly for the Ministryof Overseas Development, and comprises certain functions concerning theadministration of the British Aid Programme. Thus they act for the ministry in scrutinising claims by overseas Governments in respect of expenditurechargeable to British aid Joans and grants; and in making the appropriatepayments. They purchase supplies on behalf of the Ministry and undertakerecruitment and other personnel functions in respect of the Ministry&apos;s technical assistance appointments overseas. They administer a number of overseaspension schemes for which the Ministry is responsible, as well as others whichare the responsibility of overseas Governments and other authorities. As wellas these, and the functions performed on behalf of the Ministry of overseas development, they act for certain other United Kingdom Departments including,in the case of the sale of military equipment to overseas Governments, theMinistry of Defence.Finance14. The Crown Agents have been required by HM Government for over a hundred years to submit their own annual accounts for audit by the Comp-troller and Auditor-General. These accounts have been published, and wereup to 1920 presented to Parliament by the Colonial Secretary. Since 1971 the accounts of their wholly-owned companies have been consolidated into theCrown Agents&apos; accounts which have been placed in the Libraries of bothHouses of Parliament15. Up to the early 1960s the Crown Agents&apos; financial relationship with theirPrincipals was carefully regulated. Most of the Principals were still colonial governments; on the one hand they were expected to put their business intothe hands of the Crown Agents, and on the other the fees which the CrownAgents could charge them were regulated by the Colonial Secretary. So weretheir loan-raising and investment activities, which were, apart from the invest-ment of their authorised reserves, entirely on behalf of Principals.
16. Two important changes were induced during the late 1950s and early1960s by the move to independence of many of the Principals. First it nolonger seemed appropriate for a United Kingdom Minister to exercise closecontrol over the Crown Agents&apos; financial activities. Secondly, it came to berealised that they could no longer count on the level of business to which theyhad been accustomed, save to the extent that they could by their own effortsretain their former Principals against whatever competition there might be,or attract new ones. The responsible Minister at the time made it clear tothem that they could not look to the United Kingdom Government for financial support, and that they must determine the scale of their organisation accordingto their success in attracting business.Expansion of Services17. The Crown Agents responded by offering a wider range of services, sothat the scale and range of their activities were greatly increased. As the funds entrusted to the Crown Agents increased it led to an expansion in theCrown Agents&apos; investment activities. At the same time, the waiver of a formerrestriction under which Colonial funds could be invested only in Treasury billsand gilt-edged stock widened the field of investment.I8. Against a background of growing administrative costs, negligible reserves in relation to the level of turnover, and the changed relationship to most oftheir overseas Principals who had become independent, the Crown Agents sawa need to build up reserves on a commercial basis. In 1967 the Board of Crown Agents set themselves a target of  7 million for these reserves, whichwas then 10 per cent of their procurement turnover, and aimed to achieve thiswithin five years. Surpluses generated on their operations which in the pasthad been distributed to Principals, were now put towards reserves. Emphasiswas placed less on the traditional fee paid services as a means of generating thesurpluses required than on participation in merchant banks and other companies,the provision of finance house facilities and investment in property both inthis country and abroad; and also on the activities of the new subsidiary,. Millbank Technical Services Ltd.19. The investment of the Crown Agents&apos; reserves assumed greater importance as they increased. In addition, the Crown Agents were beginning to go beyond their former practice of employing only the deposits placed with them by theirPrincipals; they decided that their financial operations would be facilitated by borrowing in the market as well as lending. The scale of such transactionsincreased substantially in the late 1960s and early 1970s.20. The changes in the relationship of the Crown Agents with their Principals,and in the nature of their operations, led to reconsideration both on the partof the Crown Agents and HMG of the Crown Agents&apos; status and legal position.While there were discussions on these questions between 1961 and 1966, these&apos; were inconclusive. In late 1969 and early 1970 the United Kingdom Govern-ment considered the implications of the changes in the scale of the Crown&apos;. Agents&apos; business, particularly their borrowing and lending on their own account,and the Governments ultitoate responsibility for the Crown Agents&apos; liabilities.
21. It was recognised that the Crown Agents were providing valuable servicesboth to1 the remaining dependencies and newly independent countries, that theywere handling substantial foreign funds and appeared to be strengthening their business without direct government assistance. Nevertheless, the increasingconcern over the Crown Agents&apos; position caused Ministers m 1971 to appoint a small advisory group to look into the status and financial operations of theCrown Agents.The Stevenson Report22. The Committee of Enquiry, under the chairmanship of Sir MatthewStevenson, had the following terms of reference:&quot; To consider whether there is a need for any changes in the status,functions and financial operations of the Crown Agents, including particu-larly their relationship to Her Majesty&apos;s Government, having regard todevelopments which have taken place in recent years in the nature of their functions and in toe constitutional status of their Principals; and to theUnited Kingdom&apos;s own interests including the needs of the remainingdependencies; and to make recommeodations on the nature of any such changes.&quot;23. The Stevenson Report has not been published. The then Minister for overseas Development took the new in a statement to the House of commons on 8 November 1971 that publication would not be appropriate since the CrownAgents work mainly for independent Governments. In a statement on 24 Jury1972 the Minister said:&quot;... The Committee found that the Crown Agents are providingcompetent and economical services, of great value to their Principalsoverseas, and that their interests and those of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the remaining British dependencies, are best served by the continuation of this full range of services. I welcome these findings, which reinforcemy confidence in the Crown Agents&apos; work for their overseas Principals.The Committee, however, commented on the constitutional position ofthe Crown Agents, and the Government^ undefined residual responsibilityfor them. The Committee recommended that there should be a clearly defined status, structure and responsibility for the Crown Agents, and made some suggestions for consideration. The Crown Agents, but nottheir subsidiary companies, have Crown exemption from taxation. TheCommittee recommended that they should bear an appropriate liability toit. I accept these recommendations and am considering how best theymay be given effect.  I will later make a further statement ... &quot;.24. In the statement to the House of Commons on 21 November 1973 theMinister said:&quot;... In my statement last year, I said that I welcomed the findings ofSir Matthew Stevensoa*s Committee, thtt the interests of the CrownAgents&apos; Principals and others would best be served by the continuation ofthe whole range of services which the Crown Agents provide.JO
The Crown Agents have adapted their organisation and structure overthe years in order to meet ... widening requirements and in particularhave established certain of their services on the basis of fully-ownedsubsidiary companies staffed by Crown Agents&apos; personnel. In the lightof the Stevenson Report, I have agreed that this process should be extended by the establishment of further wholly-owned subsidiary companies todeal with the specialised financial services of the Crown Agents. the boards of management of those companies will include non-executivedirectors appointed after consultation with me, as well as executivedirectors drawn from the Crown Agents&apos; staff. The Crown Agents intendthat the investment policy pursued by these companies should be generally in accord with the trustee analogy and should be fully consistent withtheir name and standing. These subsidiary companies will be subject to taxation in the normal way, and arrangements are also being made tobring any profits which may be made by the headquarters organisationitself within the scope of normal taxation.The Crown Agents will, as in the past, be appointed by the Secretary ofState, or by myself acting on his behalf, for the purpose of carrying outthe various services on behalf of the overseas Principals. They will thusremain answerable finally to Ministers, but it is neither my intention normy desire to disturb the traditional practice under which the operations ofthe Crown Agents on behalf of their overseas Principals have been dis-charged on a basis of non-intervention by Ministers.In the future as in the past, the scale and scope of the Crown Agents&apos;operations will depend on the confidence which overseas governments and authorities repose in the organisation. That confidence is fully reflected in the present scale of operations, and I am particularly anxious that thearrangements I have mentioned, which are designed to produce a more readily comprehensible structure and to define the various functions more clearly, should in no way disturb that confidence.A New Look25. The General  lection of February 1974 came before these arrangements had been put into effect. The incoming Government decided to take a newlook at the future of the Crown Agents. On 31 July 1974, the Minister of overseas Development announced new proposals which re-emphasised theultimate responsibility of the Crown Agents to the United Kingdom Government.A Board with a full-time Chairman and up to seven part-time members was tobe appointed. The Minister would continue the practice of not intervening inthe activities of the Crown Agents on behalf of their overseas Principals, but would issue financial and investment directives which the Crown Agents wouldhave to follow in their future business. These directives were formally issued in February 1975. They required the Crown Agents to apply the best standards of banking prudence to their own account business, not to engage in trans-actions which might embarrass the United Kingdom Government or conflict with the interests of overseas Principals, not to engage directly in the propertymarket, except in respect of property for their own occupation or on behalf ofPrincipals, and to carry out an orderly phased withdrawal from the sphere of secondary banking activities.
Financial Difficulties26. The Crown Agents had invested in and lent heavily to the property and secondary banking sectors. Towards the end of 1973 and progressively in early 1974 these sectors encountered severe financial problems with the resultthat the Crown Agents&apos; involvement became increasingly vulnerable. Certaincompanies to which the Crown Agents had funds committed went into liquidation-tion or receivership; in addition the Crown Agents co-operated with thesupport operation organised by the Bank of England and avoided makingprecipitate withdrawals of funds. In the Autumn, the new Senior CrownAgent appointed Coopers and Lybrand as consulting accountants to review the Crown Agents&apos; financial position and future financial requirements; andMorgan Grenfeil and Company Ltd to advise on general banking matters.27. In a statement to Parliament on 18 December 1974 the then Minister of overseas Development said:&quot;... the Chairman ... has reported to me that a decline in market value of some of the assets of the Crown Agents has led to an immediate problem of reserves and liquidity. He has made a formal request to theGovernment for financial assistance.The requirement is related to the realistic writing down of assets valuesin the accounts, and to the need to ensure financial backing appropriate to operations involving some  600 million, excluding funds of some  200million managed for Principals.The Government have agreed to provide  85 million, subject to Parlia-mentary authority, which will be recoverable, by direction, from futureearnings or appreciation of assets. Standby facilities of  50 million havealso been arranged by the Bank of England.These arrangements will demonstrate beyond all doubt that theGovernment stand behind the Crown Agents so that the position of alldepositors is fully safeguarded; that the confidence of their overseasPrincipals is fully maintained; and that the important services provided to the Principals are continued... hon Members will clearly want toknow how the circumstances necessitating this financial support have arisen. I have asked the Chairman of the Crown Agents to send me afull report on this, and I shall keep the House informed. Thereafter Ishall consider whether any further action is necessary.I have also asked to be informed in detail of outstanding longer-termcommitments of the Crown Agents, including certain property invest-ments in Australia, and of any suggestions which the new Board mayhave for the organisation and management of its financial business in thefuture. I have reserved the right to direct that monies now being advancedshall be repaid from Crown Agents&apos; resources in the course of anyreconstruction of the business...&quot;.28. The Crown Agents had both a solvency and a liquidity problem. Theyneeded the capital sum of  85 million in respect of realistic writing down of assets in the accounts and also the income deriving from the investment of thegrant to offset the cost of borrowings which were not producing adequate
returns. The Government therefore decided that assistance should be in theform of a grant which would be recoverable by direction. The Crown Agentswere also informed that since the assistance was in the form of a grant no interest would be payable.29. In June 1975 the Crown Agents were given directions on the detailed arrangements for the management of the grant. These included the invest-ment of the grant in short-dated gilts and local authority bonds; and require-ments for the Crown Agents to submit monthly reports on the deployment ofthe grant, quarterly financial reports and an annual report on the overallfinancial situation and the prospects for repayment of the grant, together withaudited annual accounts, not normally later than six months after the end ofthe financial year concerned.30. In a statement on 23 April 1975, the Minister said:&quot;... Since December, overseas Principals have increased the. scope and scale of their business with the Crown Agents. Confidence hasincreased, and it is right that this should be so, for the steady andgradual withdrawal from property investment and secondary banking,according to my directive, is restoring a fundamental financial soundnessin their operations.... The Chairman has provided me with his Board&apos;s views on thecircumstances which led to the need for financial support, which havebeen assisted by the investigations carried out by Coopers and Lybrand, theconsulting accountants. These are not yet complete. They have had towork on a very large number of transactions made over a long period oftime.The principal factors which the Board considers to have contributed to the problems are: first, the operation of a substantial banking businesswithout an adequate capital base; second, over-dependence on the pro-perty and secondary banking sectors, and commitment of an unduly largeproportion of the total banking resources to a small number of borrowers;third, inadequate controls and procedures for approving and monitoringloans to subsidiary and associated companies, for security for advances,and for the delegation of authority; fourth, lack of outside commercialbanking experience among senior staff. These defects of the past arerapidly being remedied.&quot;31. Remedial measures taken include the following:(i) the Crown Agents&apos; own account borrowings have been reduced andthey have made phased withdrawals wherever possible from secondarybanking and property companies to which no further advances wiHbe made except where there is already a prior commitment; deposi-tories of Crown Agents&apos; funds are limited to British Governmentobligations, banks, nationalised industries and local authorities,approved as to name and amount by the Board of Crown Agentsacting on the advice of a Credit Committee;(ii) new staff with considerable commercial banking and investmentexperience in the United Kingdom and overseas have been recruitedie a Director of Finance, a Head and a Deputy Head of Banking;
and a Financial Controller seconded from the consulting accountants;and the consulting accountants, Coopers and Lybrand, are providingsupport in the field of control and management and Morgan Grenfell,on banking matters; a professionally qualified property surveyorhas also been engaged to advise on property questions pendingwithdrawal from all property investment other than for the CrownAgents&apos; own occupation or on behalf of Principals.32. In the statement on 23 April the Minister also announced two other major conclusions. First both Ministers and the Board of Crown Agentsbelieved that an independent enquiry into past events and their circumstanceswas needed. Judge E S Fay QC had therefore been appointed to head aCommittee of Inquiry &quot; to inquire into the circumstances which led to theCrown Agents receiving financial assistance from the Government &quot;. Secondly,the Government proposed to give further consideration to the relationship between the Crown Agents and the Government.33. On 16 October 1975 the Minister for Overseas Development told theHouse of Commons:&quot;... I have now received the audited accounts for 1973 and 1974 andhave placed copies in the Libraries of both Houses. The balance sheet asat 31 December 1974 shows that the Government grant of  85 million was not enough in the event to avoid a technical state of insolvency, withliabilities exceeding assets at that date by some  15 million. This was because a greater degree of writing down of asset values and provision forlosses were found necessary for the period covered by the accounts.I should emphasise that the Crown Agents have no immediate liquidityproblems. They have still not needed to draw on the  85 million grant oron the standby facility ...Nevertheless, without Government backing, the Crown Agents would atpresent be in a difficult position, which would affect the confidence ofdepositors and others. I have therefore thought it desirable formally to reaffirm the assurance given by my predecessor in December 1974, thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government stand behind the Crown Agents34. The deficit of  15 million shown in the 1974 accounts is likely to increasebecause of the Crown Agents&apos; continuing need to finance loans and investmentswhich are at present yielding inadequate or no returns. The basis on which any further sum needed to eliminate the deficit, or for any other reason may bemade available, will need to be decided at the time in the light of the CrownAgents&apos; financial position.The Future35. The organisation and functions of the Crown Agents have grown overthe years and been adapted to meet changing circumstances. But their consti-tution and the responsibilities of the Minister have remained undefined. events in recent years have emphasised the necessity to establish the Crown Agents ona suitable legal basis, and to define more clearly their functions and powers,particularly in respect of non-agency activities, and their relationship withHMG.  The extent of their financial operations must be carefully defined,
subjected to proper control and put on a sound basis. In the management oftheir business they must be able to operate on their own responsibility whilesubject to Ministerial direction in regard to general policy. With this end inview it is necessary to establish the Crown Agents&apos; status and relationship withthe Government in a manner readily understood by Parliament, the public andthe overseas Principals and to retain their confidence in the Crown Agents.36. A number of different forms of organisation were considered. TheGovernment decided that the right course would be incorporation. TheMinister indicated in the statement on 16 October 1975 that the government intends to introduce legislation which will confer an independent legal person-ality on the Crown Agents by incorporating them. This legislation will definetheir functions for the future and provide specified powers of direction for ministers. It will reflect the relationship which already exists between a numberof bodies in the public sector and the Ministers responsible for them. It willclarify the responsibilities of Government in exercising broad oversight overthe activities of the Crown Agents while leaving responsibility for its day today affairs to the Board of Crown Agents. It is not intended to disturb the traditional relationship between the Crown Agents and their overseas Principalsas it is essential that the customary standards of confidentiality should continueto be strictly observed in respect of the Crown Agents&apos; transactions on their behalf.37. The principal features of the proposed legislation are considered underthe following heads:(i) the future scope of the Crown Agents&apos; functions;(ii) the type of organisation best suited to performing such functions;(iii) the necessary financial provisions;(iv) the degree of Ministerial and Parliamentary control.Scope and Functions38. Principals. The Crown Agents will be empowered to act on behalf ofthe categories of Principals listed in paragraph 11 and will have the duty of continuing to provide services for the dependencies and Associated States.39. Functions. The Crown Agents will be empowered to carry out pro-fessional, technical, commercial and financial services on behalf of authorisedPrincipals whether directly or indirectly, and in so doing may act themselvesor through subsidiary companies. It is not now intended to develop sub-sidiary companies to deal with the specialised financial services of the CrownAgents as earlier proposed (paragraph 24), nor is it intended to establish abanking subsidiary. The future scope and scale of the activities on the financialside of the Crown Agents themselves will however need to be clearly defined,in particular the extent to which they should continue to accept deposits fromtheir Principals (managing the resultant funds in their own name). It isa natural and convenient adjunct to the Crown Agents&apos; procurement and other services that their Principals should continue to be able to maintain accountsin sterling with the Crown Agents. The Government will however explore thepossibility of some phased reduction in the level of Principals&apos; deposits so as to
relate the scale of the Crown Agents&apos; financial activities more closely to their other services to their Principals. This will need to take full account of theneeds and&apos;wishes of Principals, who will be consulted throughout, and wouldin any case take place gradually over a period of years. The legislation will therefore need to confer full financial powers on the Crown Agents.40. The proposed legislation will authorise the Crown Agents to carry outactivities in the following fields:I Professional technical and commercial services(a) procurement&apos; services, including buying, arranging insurance and shipping of stores, material, livestock, plant and equipment of allkinds (from any country);(b) technical inspection services all over the world;(c) professional advice on projects; feasibility studies; management of projects; and placing of contracts for projects;id) consultancy and training services;0) purchase of real property on behalf of Principals together with relatedproperty management and advisory services;if) services in connection with the design and production of currency,postage stamps and other security documents; the sale of stamps andcurrency for collectors;is) personnel services such as recruitment of staff for service overseas,booking passages, payment of salaries and pensions.H  Financial services(a) the management of individual investment funds in accordance withgeneral or specific instructions from Principals;(b) the employment in the Crown Agents&apos; own name of monies in sterling and foreign currencies deposited with them for investment or otherwise,by their Principals;(c) the making of such miscellaneous payments under standing or specificinstructions as Principals may from time to time require;id) the provision of overdraft or other credit facilities to Principals on commercial terms;(e) acting as Registrar for Principals&apos; public sterling loans;if) the management for Principals of other loan raising and servicingoperations;Or) the administration and management of aid loans on behalf of theMinistry of Overseas Development, international organisations orrecipient Governments;(A) acting as trustees.JJI Such other functions within the general scope of the legislation as theMinister may from time to time authorise.
Future Organisation41. Title It is intended that the present title &quot;The Crown Agents forOversea Governments and Administrations &quot; should be retained. Not onlyis it well known, but it is an expression in general use in the legislation of anumber of overseas countries.42. Status The Crown Agents will be a statutory corporation with thepowers and functions set out above and like other such corporations will notbe a Crown body in the formal sense of that term. The Crown Agents atpresent enjoy certain immunities and privileges deriving from their Crownstatus. If any of these art to be maintained specific provision will have to bemade in the legislation.43. Constitution This will be based on the arrangements announced on31 Jury 1974 (paragraph 25), namely the appointment by the Minister of aBoard consisting of a Chairman and such other members as the Minister may consider appropriate. Appointments may be full-time or part-time. TheBoard will be responsible for the day to day management of the business whilesubject to the Ministers direction in respect of general policy and of those matters on which the legislation may provide that the Minister may give directions.Financial Provisions44. The Crown Agents will be incorporated with a capital structure andborrowing powers appropriate to their assets, liabilities and on-going activities.The legislation inter alia will provide that they shall:(a) so conduct their business as to secure that their revenue is not less thansufficient, taking one year with another, for making provision for themeeting of charges properly chargeable to revenue;0) adopt such further financial objectives as the Minister may from timeto time prescribe;(c) not be exempt from taxation; and Id) dispose as the Minister may direct of some or all of any surpluseswhich may be earned.45. The proposed legislation will provide for the Crown Agents to identifyand account separately for the assets and commitments which are not to beretained in the longer term, including any further amounts payable in respectof these assets and commitments and the financing costs associated with them.These derive in general from the activities of the Crown Agents discussed inparagraphs 17-21 above, and were the principal cause of the difficulties leading to the need for the assistance from public funds described in paragraph 27.The Crown Agents will have a duty to realise these assets and commitments inaccordance with the general guidelines which the Government will provide.Separate accounting for such realisations will mean that progress made withthem and their financial implications will be clearly shown; at the same time they will not distort the accounting picture of the on-going business of the new corporation.
46. Accounts and Reporting The legislation will provide that the CrownAgents should keep proper accounts and other records and will prepare inrespect of each accounting year a statement of account in such a form as theMinister may with the approval of the Treasury direct. These accounts willbe audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General who will lay a copy ofthem together with a copy of any report he makes on them before Parliament.The Crown Agents will be required to make a report to the Minister each year on the performance of their functions during the year and the Minister will lay a copy of this before Parliament. They will also be required to inform theMinister of any matters affecting or arising out of their functions in whichthere may be public or Parliamentary interest so that they may be discussedas necessary.Powers of the Minister47. It is the intention that the relationship between theCrown Agents and theGovernment should be generally comparable with that which exists betweenthe Government and a number of bodies in the public sector, so that theMinister in consultation with such other of his colleagues as may be appropriatewill remain broadly responsible to Parliament for the activities of the CrownAgents, but not answerable for their day to day business, except insofar as hegives specific directions as provided for in the legislation. The Minister willnot intervene in particular transactions undertaken by the Crown Agents onan agency basis for their Principals. However power will be retained to direct the Crown Agents to continue to provide or to cease to provide specific services or to continue to act or to cease to act for specific Principals if the public interestso demands; and the provision of services which may involve the CrownAgents and through them the public funds in a measure of financial risk willbe subject to Ministerial direction. The legislation will make provision fordirections to be made, where appropriate, with the approval of the treasury and, in particular areas, for example the Crown Agents banking operations,it may be appropriate for such powers to be exercised directly by the Treasury.(In the case of exchange control, the Crown Agents will need to secure Treasurypermission in the normal way.)48. In carrying out activities in accordance with the foregoing paragraphs, not specifically on account of a Principal, the Crown Agents will act in accordancewith guidelines to be determined by the Minister from time to time. Theseguidelines may cover the nature of the assets in which the Crown Agents mayinvest and may require the Ministers specific approval in particular areas,notably any further involvement in property in accordance with the ministers statement of 31 July 1974 and any acquisition by the Crown Agents of interestsin corporate bodies. It should be noted that the Ministers directive ofFebruary 1975 (paragraph 25) precluding inter alia investment in the secondarybanking field still remains in force.49. Thus the Ministers powers of direction will be confined to:(a) those of a general character concerning the Crown Agents&apos; activities inso far as they relate to matters appearing to the Minister to concern thepublic interest;
(b) specific powers to exercise control in the areas already indicated above,including in particular those parts of the Crown Agents&apos; activities whichmay give rise to substantial financial risk; and(c) other financial matters such as the establishment of financial targets,borrowings and disposal of capital and/or revenue surpluses.50. Provision of Information The Minister will be empowered to seek such other reports and information from the Crown Agents as may be needed on matters of public or Parliamentary interest, and particularly in relation tosums advanced by the Government.Conclusion51. Subject to any modifications which may be desirable when the findings ofthe Fay Committee become available, these represent the governments proposals Tor the future work of the Crown Agents. Their purpose is to enablethe Crown Agents&apos; operations to go forward within a framework of publiccontrol and accountability; and to reconcile the responsibility which UnitedKingdom Ministers must have towards them with the need to maintain the relationship of confidence which exists between the Crown Agents and their overseas Principals. Within this framework, the Government believe that theCrown Agents will be able in the future to continue and develop the valuableservices which they have for so Jong provided for those Principals, and to theGovernment in its relations with overseas countries.Printed la England by Her M*jeity&apos;i Stationery Office it St Stephen&apos;!
