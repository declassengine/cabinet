TH^ DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST*&apos;S government cp(76) 95 May 1976CABINETCUTTING THE COST OF THE CIVIL. service memorandum by the Lord Privy SealINTRODUCTION1.        In December last, during our discussions on public expenditure,we agreed to reduce the forecast size of the Civil Service in 1978-79 by5 per cent, thus saving  140 million.    I was invited to consider how this reduction might be brought about.2.        Subsequently the Ministry of Defence was excused from contributing to the  140 million because it is separately required to make broadlycomparable staff savings.    In consequence, the whole of the reduction fallson the staff and administration cost of civil Departments - a saving on the gross expenditure forecast in the Public Expenditure Survey (PBS) not of5 per cent but of 8 per cent.3.        Some of the expenditure of the Department of the Environment fallson the Defence Budget and some of the staff and related cost of various departments are covered by fees and other receipts.    Taking account ofthese points, a saving of  140 million in net expenditure amounts to abouta 9 per cent cut.THE APPROACH TO THE EXERCISE4.        Although everything poosible must be done to Improve efficiency, itis clear - as Cabinet accepted from the outset - that savings in the CivilService of the order now required can be achieved only by cutting down thework to be done - by dropping certain policies and by accepting a measureof rougher justice.   Moreover, cuts in the work must take account ofrelative priorities amongst Government policies; it would not make senseto apply an arbitrary, across-the-board percentage cut.   Apart from itsinherent uaffoundness, such an arbitrary cut would lead to serious difficulties with the National Staff Side, who have stressed, and been given repeatedassurances, that the Civil Service must be adequately staffed to do its work.copy NO    81
5.        I therefore invited my colleagues to identify the consequences forthem of a range of cuts - 5 per cent, 10 per cent and 15 per cent - in theirforecast 1978-79 expenditure so that we could consider collectively theavailable options and decide on a package of cuts which would do leastdamage overall to our policies.6.        In view of the current review of overseas representation, I acceptedthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s suggestion that his department should not take part in this Options exercise).    The Foreign and commonwealth Office is not, however, excluded from contributing to the 140 million saving and for that Department an average share would be 7 million.   I propose that we should therefore seek savings of 133 million from the net expenditure of the remaining civil Departments.It is only fair to add that, since the outcome of the review is unlikely tobe known until at least the end of 1976, there might be practical problems for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in securing the whole of anysavings recommended by 1978-79.UNEVEN EFFECTS OF THE PROPOSED CUT7.        In the course of PES 1975 forecast staff expenditure for 1978-79 insome Departments had already been reduced by 10 per cent (the formulacuts&apos;).    These Departments (indicated in annexes A, B and C) have found it particularly difficult to make additional cuts for that year to contribute to the  140 million saving.    On the other hand, revenue Departments andother Departments whose work is largely demand-related and who were onthat account exempted from the formula cuts still find themselves with little room for manoeuvre.    For mem, the work-load is increasinginexorably because of the economic situation, and if the basic economicassumptions underlying PES 1975 prove to be wrong, then their staffingneeds will also change.    A particular problem for the revenue deparment is that staff reductions in many areas tend to reduce the revenue collected.WHAT IS PRACTICABLE ?8.        Ministers have in general accepted my suggestion that they should seek to make a contribution to the required  140 million by saving 2 per cent of their staff and administrative costs between now and 1978 as a result of improving productivity - for example by making more effective use of staffinspection and other management services.    Beyond that they have identifiedpolicy changes or measures of rougher justice, but they have not found iteasy to put forward options which they find acceptable.   Expenditure on manpower is only one element In their public expenditure programmes andfor most Ministers large reductions in manpower would involve wide-rangingimplications for their policies, which have only recently been thoroughlyreviewed during our discussions leading up to the Public Expenditure white paper (Cmnd 6393).   la general, therefore, the options put forward consistof a large number of individually small reductions, all of which, if imple-mented, would involve disadvantages, some of them serious.   There iscertainly no painless way of making the savings we want.2
9.        The options described by Ministers are given in Annexes A, B and C,which represent my assessment, based on the views of colleagues, of how the cuts divided, Department by Department and Minister by Minister, into three broad categories of acceptability.   I have in general, of course,accepted the ordering which my colleagues gave of their options and theirviews on what is totally unacceptable, but the annexes do not purport to strike an even balance of acceptability between Departments.   Any adjust-ments in that direction must emerge from our collective discussion of this paper.THE NEED FOR CONSULTATION10.      Because the cuts have disadvantages - sometimes for otherDepartments than the one which put forward the option - they plainly need tobe explored in depth before final decisions on implementation are taken andthere may need to be consultation with groups outside as well as insideGovernment.   For example, the Secretary of State for Social Services mustconsult the Supplementary Benefits Commission.    The Secretary of State for employment is in a position of peculiar difficulty as executive responsibility in most of his field has been delegated to the Manpower Services Commission,the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Services Council and the health and Safety Commission.   He is committed to consult these bodies,on which the Trades Union Congress (TUC) has the dominant voice, beforereductions in their programmes could be agreed upon.    Strong oppositioncan be expected from mem all.   Departmental Staff Sides have been toldabout the &quot;options exercise&apos; and, after we have decisions in principle,detailed consultation will be necessary with them.   For all these reasons,I cannot ask my colleagues at this stage to agree to the precise details ofthe package of cuts which is necessary.   I hope, however, that we canagree on the distribution of the  133 million amongst Departments and thegeneral areas for reduction within Departments, leaving Ministers free to adjust the final details of how they achieve their allotted saving taking account of the further consultations and investigations they plan to make.What follows is based on this assumption.MY PROPOSALS11.      In Annex A I have listed possible savings which I consider, based on my reading of colleagues letters, would not have unacceptably damaging consequences for our policies.    In total these savings amount to  70^ million or roughly 21, 000 staff.   I invite my colleagues to accept these.12.      In Annex B I set out proposals, drawn from my colleagues&apos; replies,which would save a further  54* million and 17, 000 staff.    Ministersindividually see serious objections to all these options and in some cases alsosee difficulties for colleagues.   But collectively I consider that we must accept them, painful though they undoubtedly are, if we are to achieve ourtarget.   They include the abolition of Vehicle Excise Duty (VED^ which hasalready been the subject of much discussion and which represents the. largestsingle saving Identified in my coUeagues* replies.   If any of these options are not3
acceptable, we shall need to substitute proposals from Annex C, which liststhe remaining options - those which appear likely to be most damaging toour policies and which in general Ministers regard ae completely unaccept-able.    There is very little room for manoeuvre, and I am sorry that I can offer no more palatable choices-    I therefore invite my colleagues toaccept the savings listed in Annex B;   this will bring the total to about  125 million which, together with the savings of  4.6 million on Post Officeagency charges consequent on abolishing VED, will bring us to within just over  3 million of the savings necessary to meet our target, a gap whichshould be filled, at least in part, by small consequential savings, forexample on accommodation and other Treasury controlled expenditure.13.      I must again stress that acceptance of this package of cuts will inevitably bring problems.    Some legislation will be needed and it will not all be non-controversial.   The measures of rougher justice will also bringadverse criticism from the public and from Parliament - perhaps from theParliamentary Commissioner for Administration.    There will also be difficulties with both the National and Departmental Staff Sides.   Redundancyon a large scale is unlikely but it is quite likely that there will be problems on particular grades in particular areas.14.      Once we have decided on measures to achieve the  133 million, it isclear that there will be very little scope for further acceptable savings in staff and related expenditure during 1978-79; few Departments will be ableto contribute anything under mis head towards a further 5 per cent cut in expenditure ae part of PES 1976.   I hope my colleagues will accept this,notwithstanding the further difficulties described below.NEW REQUIREMENTS SINCE PES 197515,      Since PES 1975 was compiled, large new manpower requirements have arisen, partly from new policy commitments and partly from changediassumptions about the demands of existing work.   For example, theChancellor of the Exchequer no longer considers it feasible for the InlandRevenue to maintain the assumption used in preparing PES 1975 that taxthresholds will be fully (revalorised1 and this could mean, up to an extra10, 000 staff in Inland Revenue in 1978-79.    New policy commitments inthe Department of Employment and its agencies could require some, 300 more staff, and devolution might well result in at least 3, 000 extraposts, a figure which greatly exceeds the numbers that can be saved inthe Scottish and Welsh Offices by the reductions in Annexes A and B.Moreover, the Secretary of State for Employment and the Secretary ofState for Social Services point out that a higher unemployment forecast for 1978-79 than the 825, 000 underlying PES 1975, which is already beingassumed as the basis for PES 1976, would significantly increase their numbers.4
16.      New commitments already amount to an additional  60 million andan increase of about 16, 000 staff - which would keep the Civil Service nearUs present else of roughly 750, 000 rather than the 730, 000 we have toldParliament we would achieve by 1978-79.   If we introduce further new policies which call for extra staff without offsetting savings elsewhere, or if the basic economic factors which govern demand-related work prove tohave been over-optimistic, the figure will rise even further.    Legislationso far passed in this Parliament haB already added 6, 500 extra staff and willadd in the coming year a further 4, 000 for which we have had to find room inthe PBS 1975 forecasts.17.       When I approached my colleagues to propose options, I thought it right to stick to the strict aim of achieving a level of manpower and related expenditure in 1978-79 which would be  140 million less than thatforecast in the 1975 PES, even although this has meant cuts of some9 per cent in the net expenditure ef civil Departments rather than the5 per cent originally intended by the Cabinet over the Civil Service as a whole.But on this basis we should now need to effect cuts of a further  60 million to accommodate the changes referred to in paragraph 15, making a totalof  200 million, and this figure could well increase still further before1978-79 is reached.   Faced with this situation, we have two alternatives:-i.      We can continue to chaee after a moving target.   But It isclear from the options identified by Departments that, while finding; 140 million will be extremely difficult, a further  60 million wouldbe impossible within the time scale without very serious damage toour policies; even if we were to accept all the options listed in annex C, many of them totally unacceptable to individual Ministers,we should still fall well short of the necessary total.ii.       We could define our objective as taking  140 million off the manpower and related expenditure as forecast for 1978*79 in the1975 PES, mat is, a reduction of that amount in the volume assumedat that time.    This has the disadvantage that we shall have achievedno reduction in the present sice of the Civil Service.   It also meansacceptance of additional claims on the contingency reserve beyond those shown in the Chief Secretary&apos;s recent report to Cabinet(CP(76) 6).18.       My own view is that the second alternative is the only practical one;an attempt to make further savings in manpower numbers for their own sakewithout a full consideration of expenditure programmes as a whole would bean illogical approach likely to cause serious damage to our strategy.    Wehave always taken the stance that the sine of the Civil Service must dependon the tasks to be performed, and this principle remains as true as ever.19.      Annex D shows the estimated increase or decrease in the aize atDepartments, Minister by Minister, between 1 January 1976 and 1 April 1978if we accept the proposals in Annexes A and B and the poet PES changes Ihave just described.
20.       I am sure that my colleagues will be disappointed that our combinedefforts seem likely to leave us with a Civil Service of at least three-quarters of a million,    I do not consider that we have any prospect of materiallyreducing this figure by looking at expenditure on staff separately from other forms of public expenditure.    If our aim is to reduce the number of civilservants further, we must look closely at the administration of those policies which are manpower intensive;  for example revenue collection and thedistribution of social security benefits, which together account for over halfthe civil servants outside the Ministry of Defence.    My colleagues may therefore wish to consider whether to set in hand a study or studies toexamine whether a fundamental new approach to the administration of suchpolicies, consistent with achieving our essential policy objectives but notexcluding policy changes which might involve legislation, could reducesignificantly the number of staff required;  such studies would need toconsider the revenue raising and public expenditure aspects of any changesas a whole, and would be most unlikely to lead to major savings by 197 8 - 79,and might well involve significant transitional costs.21.       I therefore invite my colloagues;-a. to accept in principle the proposals in Annex A;b. to accept in principle the proposals in Annex B (or savings of a similar order from Annex C);c. to agree that Ministers must have some freedom, in thelight of their further consultations and investigations, to vary indetail the ways in which they achieve the savings allotted to their departments;d. to agree that Departments will be unable to put forwardfeasible options to make a further 5 per cent saving in staff and related Expenditure in PES 1976;e. to agree that the present exercise cannot yield additional savings to offset existing or future commitments since PES 1975;f. to accept the need for exceptional restraint during thenext two years in bringing forward proposals which involveextra civil servants;g. to consider whether to set in hand a study or studies of manpower intensive activities, taking account of their public expenditure implications as a whole.civil Service Department5 May 1976 ^
