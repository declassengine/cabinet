IMPLICATIONS OF POSTPONING CHILD BENEFIT AND POSSIBLE COMPENSATINGMEASURESMemorandum by Treasury and Department of Health &amp; Social SecurityOfficials1*        This paper has been prepared by officials in response to therequest made by Cabinet at their meeting on 6 Hay.   Fart I considers the administrative, expenditure and other implications of postponing the introduction of the Child Benefit (CB) scheme beyond the presentstarting date of April 1977*   It assumes that Family Allowances (PAH)and Child Tax Allowances (CTAs) would be continued on their present basis.   Part II examines a way of phasing in the Child Benefit scheme in 1977 which would be equivalent to extending FAN to the first childand would reduce the effect of the scheme on take-home pay.   Part IIIdiscusses possible measures to relieve family poverty which might be combined with a decision to postpone the scheme.   The administrativeimplications of postponement for the DHSS are set out in Annex 1.The manpower requirements of the CB scheme are shown in Annex 2.   TheGovernment^ existing commitments on the starting date of CB are listed in Annex 3 while Annex k shows the development of the commitment totransferring family support from husband to wife.SUMMARY2.        The conclusions of the paper are as follows:(I) Provided that a decision is taken on 20 May, It wouldbe possible to postpone the CB scheme.   The administrative difficulties could be overcome but the Government would be criticised for abortive expenditure on preparations.(II) Postponement would have several Important advantages:It would avoid an abrupt reduction in take-home pay at thetime of the next pay deal and would also avoid a substantial increase In public expenditure and in net Exchequer cost.- 1 -SBCRBT
Ministers will want to weigh these advantages against thepolitical disadvantages of postponing a scheme to which theyare firmly committed.(iii) If however Ministers decided in favour of postponement,there would he considerable advantage in making it forthree years (or sine die) rather than for one year or two.(iv) As an alternative to postponement, the drop in take-homepay could be reduced by phasing in the CB scheme.   (It is notpossible to extend PAM to the first child for 1977.)   Thiswould involve reducing instead of abolishing the under-11 rateof CTA, making the CB rate for second and subsequent children the same as the present PAM rate and perhaps paying a lower rate of CB for the first child.   This option would be asexpensive as Child Benefit at the rates which the Cabinet has considered.   It would also add to DHS3 staff costs whiledelaying the offsetting staff saving from Inland Revenue.(v) Other alternatives for 1977 would depart altogether(for that year) from the CB concept, but would help to relievefamily poverty.   These would include an increase in ChildInterim Benefit (for one-parent families), an increase in PAMfor large families, an increase and extension of Family income supplement, and a relaxation for those with families of the        &apos;entitlement conditions for the higher rate of supplementary allowances.I,     IMPLICATIONS OP POSTPONEMENT(i)   The problems3,        It Is not yet too late to postpone the starting date of the CBscheme but It soon will be.   That is beoause a decision on postponementis linked with the rate of benefit to be paid on PAH renewal order
books, which^nust now be printed for issue from August at the rate ofabout 100,000 a week.   The books run for 12 months and so it isnecessary to decide whether, in the five months April - September 1977,the families will receive FAM or CB.   The deadline for printing theorder books was 6 May but, if a firm decision can be taken - one way or the other - on 20 May, it should just be possible to issue them intime.   If the decision were left beyond that date, many families wouldnot have their new order books when the old ones expired.k* The administrative task of postponement would be feasible butthe consequences would be formidable. Preparations are far advancedand expensive commitments have been undertaken.   In particular:(i) The large new office complex which has been speciallybuilt in Washington New Town would stand empty, unless anduntil temporary alternative use could be arranged.(ii) Five hundred clerical staff are already in post.Many more clerical posts have been advertised and 2,500applications received.   Jobs are desperately needed in thearea and the saving from not employing these staff would bepartly offset by social security payments.(Hi)   There might be trouble with the staff aide in DHSSover those DHSS staff in Newcastle who have volunteered forthe CB centre,(iv)     Thirteen mi11inn claim packs would be wasted (becausethe starting date is printed on them),(Details of these and other consequences are given in Annex 1.)5. It would be necessary to continue the payment of Child InterimfisaaCit (CHIB) for the first child of one-parent families. (CHIB was introduced only in April this year at  i.50 a week - the same rate asSAM.)   There would be no great operational difficulty about that and
no need for new legislation.   The cost of CHIB would continue to heabout  20 million a year gross and  10 million net.6.        The position on students is more awkward.   Although postponement of cbs. would not create any serious administrative problem, it wouldbe necessary for DHSS to take action over the 100,000 parents who havebeen told that their student sons and daughters would probably be excluded from child benefit.   Moreover, following the meeting of theSocial Services Committee on 3 May, reference was about to be made tothe Cabinet on two related questions:   first, how to re-shape thestudent support system if CTAs were abolished in respect of students and secondly, what to do about students&apos; present access to supplementaland unemployment benefits.     If a decision to abolish CTAs weredeferred, the first question would have to be deferred with it.   Thesecond would remain but it would have to be looked at afresh in thenew situation.(11)   The advantages7*        An important advantage of postponing the CB scheme would - as ministers sre well aware - be that this would avoid the sharp cut intake-home nav which all family men would otherwise suffer in April 197?through losing their CTAs.   The loss would vary from  2.02 a week forone child to  5.U4 for four children and more for more children. Thiswould create a dangerous pressure on pay in the midst of discussions with the TUC on incomes policy for 1977-78.   Against that there is thepolitical expectation of a substantial increase in the support madedirectly available to the mother - to which all parties are committedand which informed opinion welcomes as a socially valuable reform.B.        The effect on manpower of postponing the CB scheme would bea saving in the short-term but a hump in later years (depending on whs0it was introduced).   With a 1977 start to the CB scheme the extra staff&apos;
compared with April 1976, would build up to 3,900 by October 1976dropping to about 1,000 by April 1978.   For a start in 1978, the peakwould be reached in October 1977 and would continue in 1978-79 - thefirst year of the  140 million reduction in expenditure on civilservice administration - and the fall would not occur until April 1979.If the start could be deferred for 3 years, until April 1980, the peakwould not occur until October 1979;   moreover, if Ministers thenwished, child benefit could be age-related from the start and age-related CTAa could be abolished:   the peak number of staff would thenbe lower at 3,700 and would fall more rapidly thereafter.    (detailed figures are given in Annex 2 and are shown on the graph.)   Theestimated saving on staff costs from postponement would be about 10 million a year in 1976-77 and in 1977-78 (if the postponement were for more than one year).9.        The main effect of postponement on public expenditure would however be that it would avoid the net Exchequer cost of the newbenefits:   about  1*0 million at a CB rate of  2.h5 a week (with a 50ppremium for some families) rising to  116 million at a flat rate of 2.65 a week.   And a further  1+5 million on CTAs for non-residentchildren (if the decision were to retain them after the start of theCB scheme).   On the other hand a statutory reduction in the entitlementof students to social security benefits, which would produce the required saving of  15 million in public expenditure, would be more to achievedifficult^lf CTAs had to be retained (see paragraph 6).10.       Postponement would also have a presentational advantage.Whenever the CB scheme is introduced, it will look like a largeaddition to public expenditure on the social services.   The fact thatthe greater part of it is offset by a reduction in tax reliefs willmake little impression on the outside observer.    By deferring thescheme the Government would look as if they were doing something about
ythe level of public expenditure and thia is a point on which there ha&quot;been substantial home and overseas criticism.11.       The DHSS would question however whether, in 1977-78 and1978-79, any net Exchequer savings are likely to be obtained frompostponement, in view of the pressures to increase either PAM or CTAsa year or both. An increase of 5Qp on PAM costs about  80 million/net of ts*apart from substantislly increasing the eventual impact cost of CB.A full year&apos;s cost of the 1976 increase in CTAs is  300 million.Against that the Treasury view is that it might well be harder for ministers to resist pressure to uprate CB, once introduced, than to resist on a combination of PAM and CTA.    (It would be administrativelypossible to increase cbs. five months after the scheme was begun.)12,       Ministers will want to consider whether the above advantages &quot;which are substsntial - outweigh the political disadvantage of postponing yet again a scheme which they have firmly and repeatedlycommitted themselves to introduce in April 1977 (see Annexes 3 and k)*A possible way of avoiding this dilemma may be to phase in ChildBenefit starting in 1977:   this is considered in Part II,(iii)   Length of postponement13, If Ministers wish to postpone the CB scheme, they will need todecide whether to do so for one year, two years, three years, or sine,die.   The points set out below are relevsnt to this decision.lh.      Postponement for ONE year, to April 1978, would mean that theCB scheme was introduced at the same time as Better Pensions;   therewould then be a fall in take-home pay not only from the withdrawal ofCTAs but also from the Increase in national insurance contributions:about 50p a week for those on average earnings who were not contracted out.     Moreover the peak in staff numbers would continue into 1978-79(see paragraph 8).
15*      Postponement for TWO years, to April 1979. would cause majordifficulties for Inland Revenue, who have to undertake a large re-coding for life insurance relief in the Autumn of 1978 and for DHSSwho expect that their local offices will be struggling, in 1978-79,to deal with queries arising from the new pension scheme.16.       Postponement for THREE years, to April 1980 would avoid boththe administrative difficulties of a start in 1979 and the coincidencewith higher insurance contributions of a start in 1978.   Moreover itwould then be possible, if Ministers wished, to move directly from an age-related system of CTAS to age-related cbs., instead of continuingwith &quot;residual CTAs&quot; for children over 11.   With three years warning itshould also be possible to prepare both family men and parents of overseas children for the loss of their CTAs and to devise suitablecompensation for a new generation of students.17.      Postponement of the scheme sine die would leave Ministers withthe maximum freedom of choice.   They could say that the new scheme would be introduced &quot;as soon as economic circumstances permit&quot;.   Thiswould enhance their credibility in some quarters but would damage itin others.- 7 -SECRET
POSSIBLE PHASING IN OF CHILD BENEFIT IN 197718.   The obvious alternative to CB would seem to be to extend the exist-ing FAM to first children from April 1977-   Apart, however, from costconsiderations, this would not now be a feasible operation and it wouldrequire principal legislation.19.   Much the same result could, however, be achieved under the existingChild Benefit Act, which provides for the payment of benefit for allchildren including the first and does not itself govern the withdrawalof CTAs nor the taxation of benefits.   In this way CB could still bepaid for all children subject to whatever tax arrangements were dictated by cost and operational considerations.20.   Under this arrangement it would not be necessary to take away thewhole of the under 11 rate of CTA as had been intended.   To take the simplest example, if CB were the same as the present FAM rate of  1.50and were paid to all children, parents would receive a  1.50 tax-freecash payment for each child and a CTA reduced by  150 for every child.For most families the reduction in take-home pay would be only 88p butthe overall cash gain would be 62p.   This scheme would be broadly similar in its distributional effects to the original  2.65 scheme andthe net cost would be about the same ( 160 million including the paymentof full rate CTAs to non-reaident children).   However, those below the tax threshold would not gain as much as under the original CB scheme.The key difference is in the effect on take home pay.   The cost couldbe reduced either by paying a lower rate of benefit for first childrenor by reducing the rate of CTA for all children by rather more.   Bothoptions would have disadvantages.   A lower benefit for the first childwould look odd in a scheme designed to end discrimination against first
121.   The simplest scheme, and two less costly variations, are shown inthe table below.   The illustrations are for basic rate taxpayers in two&apos;parent families:Child benefit	CTAs under 11	Effect on take-home pay	Net cash gain for family	Premiums required	Net Exchequer Cost (1975 Surve; Prices)Weekly	(a) Annual	Weekly	weekly	Weekly	(b) Annual 1.50 for all children	 170	Fall of 88p a family	 1-50 to non-taxpayers ; 62p to tax-payers	None	 162 m 1.20 for 1st child;  1.50 for other children	 170	Fall of 88p a family	 1.20 to non-taxpayers ; 32p to tax-payers	50p a family for 1-parent families	 90 m f 1.50 for all children	 140	Fall of  1.08 for 1 child families; and a further fall of 20p for each subsequent child	 1.50 to non-taxpayers ; taxpaying 1 child families gain 42p, 2 child families 22p, 3 child families 2p. (c)	50p for each child in 1 parent families and 4th and subsequent child in 2 parent families	 81 mNotes.(a)   CTAs for children 11-15 includive would be  35 higherchildren and would run contrary to previous Government statements thatthey would introduce the CB scheme at a flat rate.   It would also haveoperational difficulties for DHSS and involve a small premium for one-parent families.   Reducing the rate of CTA for all children would putfirst children on the same footing as other children but would increasethe take-home pay effects and involve premiums for large as well as one*parent families.
and for 16-18 inclusive  65 higher.   CTAs for children 19and over would he  365 in all cases.(b) Includes present estimated cost of  45m for CTAs fornon-resident children; this cost would be lower if CTAs were allowed at reduced rates only.(c) With the premium larger families make a cash gain,increasing with the size of family.22.   The above schemes assume that the^proposals for reducing CTAs wouldbe operationally feasible for the Inland Revenue.   Further study isbeing given to this^including its manpower implications.   An alternativeapproach which would be to subject the CB to tax and clawback as withFAM at present.   Both would be collected as a deduction from tax allowances and shown as such on FAYE codings.   The distributional effectswould, however, be similar.23. The adoption of any of the above options would have the followingadvantage:(a) The CB scheme could be introduced while mitigating themain objection to the original proposals, the substantial fallin take-home pay.m(b) The gains for the great majority, the taxpaying families,would be of the same order and there would still be a sub-stantial gain for those below the tax threshold.(c) Whilst leaving some rough edges, it would avoid many ofthe political and practical disadvantages of postponement.24.   On the other hand, in addition to the difficulties discussed inparagraph 20 above, the options would have the following disadvantages:
(a) They all involve a substantial net Exchequer cost of thesame order as the original schemes plus the  4-5 million fornon-resident children.(b) All the manpower costs of introducing CB would be incurredbut the offsetting savings on the Inland Revenue would not beavailable.(c) All the options still involve a reduction in the father&apos;stake-home pay though less than with the CB scheme (for example,88p or  1.28 for a two-child family compared with  5-16).(d) Although the overall gains for families would be broadly the same, presentationally a CB rate of  1.50 would be much less than any figure previously discussed or expected publicly.25.   Students;   With CTAs retained for all children at substantial levelsthere could be no question of excluding students under 19 from the childbenefit scheme as previously planned.26.   Non-resident children:   With these more modest reductions in take-home pay it might be possible to avoid special treatment for non-resident children - this would reduce costs by  19 to  22 million on thebasis of the options in paragraph 21 above.POSSIBLE ANTI-POVERTY MEASURES IP SCHEME POSTPONED2?. If Ministers decide to postpone the scheme they may wish to consider some accompanying measures to relieve family poverty.
28.   The possibilities which we have considered are:Postponement of future increases in the school meal charge.Increase in Child Interim Benefit.Increase in FAM for large families.Increase and extend Family Income Supplement to those working24 hours a week.Reduce the waiting period for long-term supplementary benefit for families with children.29.   School meal charge:   In addition to the 5p increase (to 20p) due in September 1976 whose postponement until April 1977 was announced on Hay, Cmnd 6393 assumed increases of another 5p in September 1977,another lOp in September 1978, and a further lOp in September 1979-However, these increases have not been announced and only obliguelyimplied in Cmnd 6393.   It would thus be difficult to make much impact on public opinion generally by cancelling any of them.   At the sametime, local education authorities would recognise the significance ofany change and would be highly critical of it, especially if it were introduced without reference to them at a time when Ministers areavowedly bringing them within the public expenditure planning process.This measure therefore seems unpromising, especially in view of the savings which would have to be foregone - about  24 million in 1977-78rising to some  96 million in 1979-80 (at 1975 Survey prices).Eligibility for free school meals would in any case be unimpaired.30.   Increase in CHIB:   Another option would be to increase the paymentof Child Interim Benefit, for the first child of one-parent families,from the present  1-50 a week to  2.50 a week.   The gross cost would be 12 million a year; after allowing for savings on supplementary benefit
the net increase in public expenditure would be  11  million.   As CHIBis taxed, the net Exchequer cost would be less, at  3 million.   Simplelegislation amending the Child Benefit Act would be required.   any increase would be likely to raise the minimum rate at which Child &apos;Benefit could reasonably be introduced in the future, and/or to makeinevitable a continuing premium for one-parent families.    It would alsoadd to the complexities of tax administration.   It would benefit some250,000 families.   Staffing costs would be a minimum of 300 ior 5 weefcStbut many more if take-up among supplementary benefit recipientsincreased substantially as it well might.31.   FAM for large families:   This option has a precedent: higher ratesof FAM for third and subsequent children were introduced in 1956, andin 1967-68 large families were given their increases in FAM beforeothers.   The gross cost of raising the present  1.50 a week to  2 forfourth and subsequent children would be  16 million a year.   The netpublic expenditure cost would be  12-J million, and the net exchequer cost  10 million.   This, too, would require simple amending legislationLike an increase in CHIB, it would either push up the minimum feasiblerate of Child Benefit and/or make inevitable a continuing premium for large families.   It would benefit 500,000 families.   This would requi^some 3,000 extra staff for 8 weeks and a small number permanently.32.    Increase and extension of Family Income Supplement (FIS&quot;):   Preset^expenditure provision allows for FIS to be uprated only by prices.   T0uprate instead by earnings would probably prevent the numbers on FIS     ^from falling and would cost less than  1 million extra a year.   Afurther change would be to reduce the number of hours&apos; work necessaryto qualify single parent families for FIS.   At present FIS is paid onU(where they work at least 30 hours a week.   A reduction to 24 hours a
week would enable about 5,000 more one-parent families to qualify.The benefit would be a real help to them.   It would also carry out oneof the Finer Committee recommendations.   The cost would be only  1 million a year and the staffing costs would be small (300 extra for weeks and a few extra permanently).33-   Long-term Supplementary Benefit;   At present all those who receivesupplementary allowances, with the sole exception of the uaemployed,are eligible for a higher rate after they have been on benefit twoyears.   The unemployed never qualify.   Two possible changes would be toreduce the qualifying period for those with dependent children from twoyears to one, and to bring into entitlement (also after one year) thoseof the unemployed who have dependent children.   This would benefitnearly 100,000 families and cost about  14 million.   Unless this were introduced at the uprating (and it is already too late for November1976) the staff costs would be substantial - 3,000 for 15 weeks.   Inany case 200 extra staff would be needed permanently.
ANNEX 1Although first payments will not be made until April 1977, claims will be taken andbooks issued from August/September 1976, only k months from now.   All the administrativePreparations have been made, and although some of the work can be put into storage thereis bound to be waste and confusion at a change so late in the day.   Some of this will beobvious to the publio and will attract criticism.   For example:a. Order books.   Renewal books (running for 12 months) issued from next Augustare to contain both FAM and Child Benefit orders.   The eovers are a differentcolour from ordinary FAM books and they have child benefit notes (telling payeesabout title and changes which have to be reported)   as well as FAM notes.   We canstill print the foils with FAM rates but there is not time to change the coversand notes.   About l  million books could be involved (about a third of the FAMload) and these would remain in use for 12 months.b. frorms, already issued.   DHSS have already had to write to parents of olderchildren so as to identify students who are to be excluded from CB.   This has beendone on the basis of a start in April 1977 - 100,000 forms with this date in have gone out.e.    Leaflets.   13 million &quot;claim packs&quot; consisting of leaflet,   index slip and2 forms have been printed for the take on of single ohild families.   These contain the 77 start date and would have to be wasted at a eost of about  150,000.d. Acoommodfltfton.   CB is to be run from a large new ocmplex of buildings atWashington New Town Co Durham.   It was because high alumina cement had been usedin one of these buildings that the original 1976 start date was lost.   The buildingsneeded for the take on are virtually ready.   Temporary alternative use would have tobe considered.   This would not be easy and would complicate the take on of CB whenit came about.e. Staff.   The CB centre at Washington will provide immediate employment for1,500*2,000 people increasing later to about 2,500.   Local recruitment is wellunder way and many existing staff in DHSS Newcastle Central Office have volunteeredfor transfer.   There may therefore be local political difficulty over not providing the expected employment opportunities; the embarrassment and expense of having toget rid of or redeploy people already recruited; trouble with the Newcastle staff side over transfers not honoured.f. Future, developments.   Deferring the start is likely to defer the date (atpresent 1979) age relation can be introduced (with consequent saving of staff onCTAs) and the introduction of 13 week books whioh would enable us to uprate withoutover-stamping in local offices (whioh costs  lm-l^m every time).POSTPONEMENT OP CB - ADMINISTRATIVE IMPLICATIONS FOR DHSS

Annex 3GOVERNMENT COMMIT MEOTS ON START DATE 0? CHILD BENEFIT.February 1974.   Labour Government takes office pledged in the manifesto tointroduoe cash allowance for all children, including the first.Summer 1974-Snriiyr 1,975.   Mounting criticism by MP&apos;s of absence of any action onpledge.   Government says cannot start &quot;before April 1976 at the earliest&quot; becauseof the operational difficulties in launching so large a scheme.April 1975.   (over a year since original commitment and after press leaks andspeculation of postponement)   Postponement of scheme announced beoause buildingshad had to be halted beoause high alumina cement had been used.   Start dategiven in House as April 1977.   Difficulty over building represented by -(heOpposition as an excuse, real reason for deferment being supposed to be public expenditure considerations.   In making the announcement in his Budget Statement on15 April 1975* Chancellor said:&quot;I also said last November that the Government would oarry out their commitment to introduoe a new scheme of child cash allowances or child benefits, payable for all children inoluding the first, as soon as resources and the practicali-ties of administration allowed.   We have now decided that, subject to parliamen-tary approval of the necessary legislation, the scheme will be introduced inApril 1977.   This is in fact the earliest date by which it is administrativelypracticable to extend family benefits to all of the 7 million families whichwill be eligible - over 3 million more than those now receiving family allowances.   Such a scheme is, of course, potentially expensive; and againstthe background of the economic prospects and the resulting need to hold baokplanned expenditure, which I have already described, we shall need to aooommo-date its cost within the total which, in the light of future reviews, we conclude that we can devote to public expenditure at large in the years beyond 1976-77.&quot;(Hansard 15 April 1975 Vol 89O col 297)Summer 197^.   During passage of Bill Labour backbenchers and Opposition attempted to write start date into Bill, beoause they suspected Government&apos;s good intentions.The Opposition spokesman said:&quot;I am sure that the Government will not resist these amendments, beoause theyhave used these dates throughout as a defence, and even I would not dare tosuspect them of just fobbing off the House.   I am sure that they would not come back with the lame excuse that they did not have the neoessary powers,or that the building was not ready, or that perhaps another part of it had
