This document is the property of her britannic majesty^ government cp(76) 15 copy no14 May 1976cabinetPUBLIC expenditure memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. On 29 April we discussed briefly the serious public expenditureproblem reported by the Chief Secretary, Treasury.   For our resumeddiscussion I enclose a further report by the Chief Secretary, Treasury,which reflects recent developments, in particular the large excess in localauthority current expenditure (on top of the excess in their spending oncouncil houses and housing subsidies) which the Secretary of State for the environment has brought to our attention.    Cabinet has been warned ofthese possibilities a number of times, but the scale of the excessexpenditure by local authorities is even greater than was feared.    If it wereto become public knowledge without a simultaneous announcement ofcorrective measures, there could be grave damage to our credibility as aGovernment which would be highly dangerous to our economy.    TheSecretary of State for the Environment and the Chief Secretary, Treasury,have been In consultation on the detailed handling of this situation and will beconsulting the other Ministers particularly concerned with localgovernment spending.2.        Sterling has just weathered a period of intense strain, at considerable cost to the reserves.    There will be a continuing risk ofrenewed pressure on the pound until we can fully restore confidence at homeand overseas by meeting the following conditions :-a. The new pay deal must receive convincing union support and thereafter must be Been to stick.b. Our policies must be firmly directed towards Improvingindustrial efficiency and this must be made evident by our choice of investment projects in the public sector and by our refusal to underwrite industrial disruption or low productivity.c. We must show decisively that the public expenditure plans inour February White Paper are being adhered to and that the alreadymassive borrowing by the public sector is not being further increased.
3,        The last of these conditions Is the one for which as a Government wehave the most direct responsibility.    There is a considerable body ofopinion, not merely among our political opponents, but also among those inthe financial sector on whoBe confidence we depend both at home and abroad,which believes that we ought to be cutting public expenditure this year; andthat if we fail to do this of our own free will, we will sooner or later be compelled to do so by the force of circumstances,    I am determined to do everything possible to avoid the unemployment which could result from having to adopt such measures in present circumstances.    But it may not bepossible to do so unless we prove that we can contain public expenditure thisyear within the limits we have so recently announced.    This is in any caseessential If we are to permit the necessary growth in our industrial output and especially in exports,4,        We do not have the.same specific powers of control over thecurrent expenditure of the local authorities as we can exercise over their capital programmes; but we must at least make full use of thoseinstruments of pressure and guidance which are available to us.    Theproposals put forward by the Chief Secretary on this issue are largely in line with those of the Secretary of State for the Environment.    They are drastic,as are his proposals on other expenditure Issues,    But nothing less willmatch the critical nature of our predicament.    They are designed not to cut the programmes we have announced, but to prevent an Increase far beyond our commitments.    As such they should be thoroughly defensible toour supporters.    I ask my colleagues to approve these proposals and toconsider how best to present our decisions as a reassertion of our determination to carry through the plans announced in the White Paper.D W treasury Chambers14 May 1976
PROGRESS REPORT ON PUBLIC EXPENDITURENemorandura by the Chief Secretary T treasury.     Since my progress report on public expenditure (CP(?6)6)which was briefly discussed on 29 April, there have been a numberof developments, and in particular the Secretary of State for the environment has informed us of increased estimates for localauthority expenditure which make the outlook for the current yearnot merely serious but critical, with major implications for1977-78 also.     In the following paragraphs I comment on the moreimportant of these developments and set out my proposals for dealingwith them.Local authority current expenditure2.     Cabinet have been repeatedly alerted to the risks of excesscurrent spending by the local authorities.     A holding figure of 100 million has been included for this item in previous progressreports on the contingency reserve.     The Secretary of State forthe Environment has now reported that revised and more reliablereturns indicate, that local authorities in England and Wales spentabout  150 million more on revenue account last year, and are planning to spend up to  500 million more this year in real terms,than was allowed for in the public expenditure white Paper.     Thereis also some prospective overspending by local authorities inScotland.5.     We will need to consider, in the context of the Layfield Report,whether to move to more effective control of the lor.al authorities or to give them greater freedom in their spending and, if we wereto adopt the latter course, how this should be reflected in ourpublic expenditure planning.     But the immediate requirement is toprevent the economic damage from this excess demand on resources which, if not halted now, would carry through into subsequent yearsalso, and the political damage to our standing if we expose1SECRET
ourselves to fresh criticism that public expenditure in general,and the local authority sector in particular, is out of control.Clearly we must require the local authorities to cut back the excessin order to give credibility to the request, in my view, we shouldbe prepared to say that, unless they do so, we will consider vitli-holding the ,further grant otherwise due to be paid under a cost increase Order later this year.Housing:4.     In my last report I drew attention to the excess developingin council house building and the subsidy bill for them this year.On the other hand, there are now prospective shortfalls inimprovement grants to the private sector and in acquisition of-houses for municipalisation which, between them, involve around 60 million.     This leaves a net claim of  140 million on the contingency reserve in respect of the housing programme as a whole. \I have discussed with the Secretary of State for the environment the possibility of other savings to offset this requirement,principally&quot; by a suspension of local authority mortgage lending inthe latter part of this year, but also by further, retrenchment on of btatemunicipalisation.     Naturally the Secretary^sees difficulty    iabout these suggestions, and I recognise the invidious position inwhich he is placed but, in view of the seriousness of the public      )expenditure situation as a whole, I see no alternative but to press for these offsetting savings.5.     As regards future years, I have warned in previous progressreports of the danger of failing to secure the savings on thesubsidy bill announced in the White Paper, and also of the probableneed to consider bringing the council house building programme undefcontrol.     The Secretary of State has now proposed, and I have ngree&apos;that in the first instance our officials should make a progress report to us within a month on the feasibility of a control on housing investment.2. SECRET i
Food subsidies and school mealsb.     In my last report I said that we might have to look again laterat the programme for phasing out food subsidies, but that meanwhile the white Paper programme should stand.     This was on the basis that a concession on food subsidies might be necessary in thenegotiations with the unions in order to secure an agreement on wages.     The unions pressed for a variety of concessions on theexpenditure front, which could have involved very large amounts, butEY Committee decided that any such concessions must be kept withina total of  50 million.     Within this figure, priority has beengiven &quot;to postponement of the planned increase in charges for school meals, at an estimated cost of  35 million.     This limited concessionwill be important in securing not only the general benefits of a lowpay round but also the avoidance of an excess in the public sectorpay bill which would have been entailed by a high level of pay settlements.     However, against this background, the previousproposal on food subsidies lapses, and the programme for phasing outwill have to be rigidly adhered to.Shipbuilding7.     El Committee have agreed in principle to new subsidies for the shipbuilding industry entailing, in addition to the existing white paper provision, perhaps  A- million this year and  18 million nextyear.     We have always regarded some support for this industry as anineluctable claim on the contingency reserve and I did not enter anyreservation on this particular conclusion.     I should, however, beresolutely opposed to further ideas which have been floated,especially the idea of speculative building of ships in the absenceof orders, whether in Belfast or in other shipyards.Child benefit scheme8.     We will be considering a separate paper on the implications of postponing introduction of child benefit grants and on possible3SECRET
compensatory measures.     I fovour postponement, &quot;but I should be bound to oppose incurring expenditure on new alternative arrangement^If we do after all decide to introduce the scheme next year, I canonly re-state my proposals for keeping the cost to a minimum, patftlJby the exclusion of non-resident children from the scheme.State&quot;of the Contingency Reserve9.     The resulting position as regards the contingency reserve forthis year and next can be summarised as follows -  million1976-771977-781975 Survey   1976-77   1975 survey prices        Prices        prices.   White Paper contingencyreserve2.   Already charged to thereserve.or now recommended3.   Balance in the reserve4.   Child benefits5-   Other firm bids (includinghousing but excluding localauthority current expendi-ture)6.   Balance7.   Other claims not yet firm(excluding local authoritycurrent expenditure)Conclusions and recommendations70040087545690029330041922560766-190-159194258-38?420-560       530-57010.   We must make it an overriding objective to keep within ourWhite Paper plans and demonstrate that we are doing so.     This mean3that we must avoid any net excess in expenditure from the contingentreserve this year and avoid building up claims against the contingeP&apos;reserve for future years.     I believe that the results of failure ipthis would be disastrous economically and politically.4SECRET
11.    In order to achieve this objective it may become necessaryto propose reductions in all expenditure programmes across theboard.     For the time being I confine my proposals to offsettingor avoiding excesses in those particular programmes where theyhave occurred or are threatened, starting with local authoritycurrent expenditure, which by itself could consume the balance ofthe contingency reserve.12.    In the light of the considerations set out above and in mylast report, I recommend that Cabinet should approve the following proposals:-(a) The Local Authority Associations should be informedimmediately that the whole of the reported excess mustbe cut back and that, unless this is done, we will considerwithholding further grant due to be paid, later in the year under a Cost Increase Order, and that the cash limit forrate support grant will be cut back to a total exclusive of such cost increases.(b) The net excess in housing expenditure this year should be offset by reductions in local authority mortgage lendingand acquisition of houses for municipalisation.(c) The requirement for the coal stockpile should be kept to aminimum; and the Ministers responsible far the nationalised industries and other industrial programmes should precludeany further claims on the contingency reserve for additional expenditure, including working capital, by accommodatingthe amount required within the programmes already approved.(d.)   The Secretary of State for Education should&quot; be invited tobring forward proposals to implement the reductions agreed by Cabinet in the net cost of educating overseas students.5SECRET
(e) We should postpone introduction of the child benefit schemeand avoid any alternative new expenditure.(f) The Secretary of State for Social Services, in conjunctionwith the Secretary of State for Education, should beinvited to bring forward revised proposals for achieving the savings already agreed by Cabinet in the payment of social security benefits to students in the light of our decisions on the child benefit scheme.6SECRETJ
