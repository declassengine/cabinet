T(confidential)CHILD BENEFIT HATEMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, TreasuryPublic expenditure the introduction of child benefit grants for all children will produce a major new public expenditure programme from 1977 onwards.    Instead ofthe present  500 million or so on family allowances (at 1975 survey prices), we shall have figures for child benefit of over  1,500 million.At the same time there will be a saving of some  850 million in tax allowances when under-11 child tax allowances are withdrawn in April1977 - and the saving will be greater when the residual allowances are withdrawn later - in addition to certain social security benefitsavings.    Therefore the net cost to the Exchequer resulting from this change will be the gross amount of the programme less the present costof family support and the tax allowance and other savings.2.     The net Exchequer cost would be kept to a minimum by fixing a child benefit rate which as nearly as possible replaced the existingallowances without making anyone better or worse off.    The nearestapproximation to this would be a grant of  2.43 for each child with a21p premium for large or one-parent families.    Even this would make80% of families better off at a net cost of  16 million.    This minimumnet cost will be increased by any raising of the rate of benefit above this minimum level.    It will be further increased if we forgo any ofthe tax savings.    As stated in the Public Expenditure White Paper, thenet cost will be treated as a charge on the Contingency Reserve.Contingency Reserve3*      In my previous progress reports on the Contingency Reserve I havebeen primarily concerned with the position in the present year.    But wemust now consider the outlook for 1977-78.   Of the reserve for that year of  900 million (at 1975 Survey prices)  260 million is already committed, including some  120 million on the improvements in pensionsand social security benefits announced in the Budget.    And there isalready a queue of other claims which, together with agreed claims,could, if they all materialised, use up the whole of the contingency reserve.    The fact that illustrative figures for the cost of theSecretary of State&apos;s likely proposals have been quoted in the past doesnot mean that a corresponding amount of the Contingency Reserve washypothecated then or is available now.Child Benefit Rate4.      The substitution of a weekly tax free cash payment to every motherfor every child will itself be a major advance in the method ofproviding family support.    It will replace the present farrago of a family allowance paid to the mother on which the father is taxable anda child tax allowance given to the father which is reduced by clawback;__ - 1 -(confidential)
(confidential)it will also extend benefit both to First children and to thosefamilies below the tax threshold who could not previously takeadvantage of tax allowances.5.      Nevertheless I do not press for the minimum figure referred to inparagraph 2 above.    In practice,  although there could be a wide range of possible optionsj  these have been narrowed down to the followingfive which are set out in detail in CP(?6)4, Rate Wet Exchequer Cost1.  2.45 * 50p premium                             39.5m2.  2.50 + 50p       &quot;                                64.9m3.  2.60  90.5m4.  2,65  115,9m5.  2.70  141.3mI firmly believe that Option 1 -  2.45 with a 50p premium - is fullydefensible.    At a cost of some  40 million it would make all familiesbetter off;  and the premium would ensure that special help went tol-parent families and families with 4 or more children.    I believe itWould be much more cost-effective to use a premium - costing some 25 million - in this way than to incur a large further additional cost in order to move to the lowest flat rate needed to ensure thatthe generality of families was no worse off.    Like the rate of  2.70proposed by the Secretary of State - which would involve a claim ofover  l40 million on the Contingency Reserve - this expenditure wouldbe unaelective and thinly spread, much of it going to families who donot need it.    I would remind the Cabinet that when we consideredexpenditure priorities last August there was considerable support for the view that we should concentrate policy on selective measures,I cannot believe that what the Secretary of State proposes is a coat-effective way of distributing scarce resources or helping the poor.Non-Resident Children6.      I would,  however,  see a little more room for manoeuvre if theCabinet rejected the proposals in CP(76)3     for a transitionalconcession for non-resident children.    This concession would addvery substantially - some  45 million - to the claims on the contingency reserve and mean forgoing large manpower savings (over 300 staff).Moreover,  it would perpetuate the massive scale of fraud in claims for non-existent non-resident children which it is impossible to checksatisfactorily.    This concession, in conjunction with any but the cheapest of the options in paragraph 5 above, would entail a totalcharge against the Contingency Reserve ranging from  110 million toOver  185 million.    I therefore strongly urge that the existing policyof excluding non-resident children from the child benefit scheme without any &quot;compensation&quot; should be maintained.- 2 -(confidential)
^confidential)Conclusions7.      If the concession proposed for non-resident children is accepted,I should see great difficulty in agreeing to any additional claim onthe Contingency Reserve in excess of the  40 million entailed by a child benefit rate of  2.^5 with a 50p premium.    Such a rate would benefit all families - the majority of whom will also have benefitedin 1976-77 to the extent of  300 million, or 40p a week,  from theBudget increases in child tax allowances - and itself represent a major improvement in the arrangements for family support.    If, however,the concession for non-resident children is rejected, I suggest thatwe should agree to a rate of  2.50 with a 50p premium,  and accept thecost of some  65 million as a charge on the Contingency Reserve.JBHM Treasury8 April 1976Cconfidential)
