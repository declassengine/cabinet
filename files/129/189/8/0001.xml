(confidential)CHILD BENEFIT RATEMemorandum by the Chief Secretary to the treasury in view of the further comments by the Secretary of State for social Services in CP(76)7,  I should like to stress the followingbrief but important points:-(1)    As the agreed tables in CP(76)4 showed,  a basic rateof  2.45 with a 50p premium would give cash gains toall families and real gains to families with one child and to one-parent families - nearly half ofall families.    It stands to reason that the gain tolarger families would be less since,  as both our197^ Manifestos made clear,  the main point of the reform is to extend support to the first child.There is no commitment to maintain the child benefitrate in line with inflation as seems to be implied by the Secretary of State for Social Services.(2)    The essential test of a premium, which I cannot acceptto be inoperable,  is whether it is a more cost-effective way of using scarce resources than increasing the basic rate in order to benefit all families,  tax free andunselectively,  at  10 times the cost per penny on therate.    Each penny on the basic rate costs some 5 million;    each penny of a premium costs only 500,000.    Since only 7% of all families at presentreceiving FAM are poor or hard-pressed,  it cannot becost-effective to increase the basic rate for the benefitof all at such exorbitant additional cost.(3)    We have always made it very clear publicly that the costof the scheme must be accommodated within the total public expenditure we can afford from 1977-78 onwards.The fact is that,  given the massive competing claims,we cannot afford the rate the Secretary of Staterecommends,  particularly if a transitional concessionis made for non-resident children.2.    I strongly urge,  therefore,  that,  if the Cabinet decide to extend the transitional concession to non-resident children at a cost of 45 million to the contingency reserve, we should not go beyond an initial CB basic rate of  2.45 with a 50p premium.    Even thiswould add another  40 million to the charge on the contingency reserve.JBHM TreasuryParliament StreetSW1JJ May I976(confidfntsaO
