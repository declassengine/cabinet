TTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 13 COPY NO jJ14 May 1976 jCABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1976-77Memorandum by the Lord President of the council. The Government^ legislative programme for the third Session of        1the present Parliament should be as attractive and balanced as circumstances allow.    There will, however, be unusually severeconstraints on the number and kind of Bills which can be fitted in.    We \shall have, at most, about 60 days available on the Floor of the House ofCommons for Government legislation (apart from the Finance and -jConsolidated Fund Bills).    &quot;We are committed to introducing the DevolutionBill as early as possible in the Session, and most or all of its CommonsCommittee Stage will have to be taken on the Floor;  this Bill might requireas much as half the available Commons Floor time or even more.    There isa considerable number of Bills which will be, or may become, Essential;for these we must allow at least another quarter of the available CommonsFloor time.    The time left for other Bills will be considerably less than usual, though no precise estimate can be made at this stage.    We must also take account of the Party balance in the Commons, which will make ourlegislation, especially any controversial Bills, more vulnerable than hitherto in this Parliament.2.        In the Commons the first half of next Session will be largely taken up by the Devolution Bill and by those Essential Bills which have an early       Hdeadline and must be introduced in the Commons because they concern &apos;,money.    By comparison with last Session and this Session, there will thenbe very restricted scope for the introduction in the Commons during the ;weeks preceding Easter of large and/or politically contentious Bills.    the lords will need sufficient time during the summer to deal with the devolution Bill, which they are unlikely to be able to start until after easter,    The Bills comprising the programme, in addition to the devolution Bill and Essential Bills, will have to include a substantial proportion which can be introduced in the Lords early in the Session.    Itwill be more than ever important that all Bills should be ready on time,and should be confined to those provisions which need to be enacted next session.1
3,        The Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future Legislation Committee (QF) have considered all tne bids for legislation next Session made by DepartmentalMinisterc and recommend that these Bills should be placed in the categoriesshown in the attached appendices.    These categories are the same as those used for the present Session except that, in the circumstances described above, the Committee propose that the whole of next Session&apos;s programmecategory should be described as &quot;provisional&quot;, and that this category shouldbe grouped into three orders of priority.    The categories are as follows:I.    Essential.    Appendix I lists those Bills which must be enactednext Session, eg because powers or finance would otherwise run out.n. Contingent. Appendix II lists those Bills which may become essential in the above sense. It does not include Bills which arecontingent upon policy decisions not yet taken.III.    The Provisional Programme.    Appendix HI lists those Bills, inaddition to the Devolution Bill, which the QF Committee recommendfor inclusion in the provisional programme.    The three orders of priority, and the Bills shown in Appendix HI under each, are:First Priority^ a small group comprising the Government^other most important legislative proposals, which we expect to enact in 1976-77:Industrial Democracy - a short paving BillHomelessness      )Housing Subsidies) &quot; qon,Wned ln one BU1Conspiracy and Criminal Law ReformShipbuilding (Redundancy Payments)Post Office Act (Amendment) - industrial democracyin the Post OfficeSecond Priority, comprising those further Bills which havethe strongest claims and which will be introduced so far asParliamentary time is available, provided they are ready,though there can be no guarantee how far it will be possible toget through this list:Industrial Training (Amendment)Coal IndustrySocial Security (Amendment) - but this Bill&apos;aintroduction will be dependent upon an assessment atthe beginning of the Session of whether it can be gotthrough the Commons;  hence it should not be mentioned in The Queen&apos;s SpeechOccupational PensionsRoad Traffic (Relaxation of Licensing)2
Water (Equalisation of Charges)Criminal Justice - those provisions which are ready for introduction by the end of NovemberExemption ClausesPatents - provided the Bill is ready for introductionwell before ChristmasThird Priority, comprising other Bills with strong claims,some of which might be accommodated if the Devolution Billtakes considerably less than half the available CommonsFloor tLr.e:Parliamentary PensionsPower Stations (Financial Arrangements)Administration of JusticeJudicature (Northern Ireland)Merchant ShippingBanking and Deposit Taking InstitutionsMiscellaneous Financial and AdministrativeProvisionsIV. Reserve Bills.    Appendix IV lists Bills which have no prospectof introduction next Session, despite their merits, unless they are taken up by a Private Member or Second P.eading Committeeprocedure is agreed and they would not divert drafting resources from Bills of higher priority.V. Scottish Grand Committee Bills.    Appendix V lists these inorder of priority.VI. Other Bills. Appendix VI lists Bills which have no prioritybut seem suitable for Second Reading Committee procedure or for introduction by a Private Member.4.        Because of the severely limited Parliamentary time available, theQF Committee have had to give a number of Bills lower priority than thatdesired by the responsible Ministers.    This is unavoidable.    The numberof Bills which we can be sure of being able to introduce next Session, inaddition to Essential Bills and the Devolution Bill, is very small;  and anyoverloading of the provisional programme, particularly the first and second priority groups, would thus be self-defeating, for it would not increase the number of Bills which could in practice be introduced next session.M FPrivy Council Office14 May 19763
