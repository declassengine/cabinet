THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 16 COPY NO        ^114 May 1976CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE:  LOCAL, AUTHORITY current expenditure 1976-77Note by the Secretary of State for the environment. We shall be discussing the Contingency Fund on the basis of theChancellor of the Exchequers memorandum CP(76) 15 covering a note bythe Chief Secretary.    Hie memorandum refers to the possibility of asubstantial overspend by local authorities on current expenditure for1976-77.2.        As background to this, I circulate the attached letter which I have sent to Ministerial colleagues most immediately concerned.3.        I shall need tc have the Cabinet&apos;s view on the line I should take with local authorities when I chair the next meeting of the Consultative Councilon Local Government Finance on 26 May 1976.P department of the Environment14 May 1976SECRET
2 MARSHAM STREETLONDON  SW1P 3EB[ %  May 1976LOCAL GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE 1976/77I should bring to your notice the disquieting information wehave just received that local authorities in England and Valesmay be proposing to spend considerably more in current expenditurethan allowed for in the public expenditure White Paper (Cmnd. 6393)- by something of the order of  300/500m.This information comes from the returns that local authoritiesmake this month to us and the local authority associations oftheir expenditure plans for 1976/77 which were used in drawing up the budget estimates for the 1976/77 rate.   They also show the estimated outturn for 1975/76.   The latter itself seems tobe considerably in excess of what was expected both by centralgovernment and local authorities during the Rate Support grant negotiations last autumn - perhaps by  100/150m.   Basingourselves on a 1975/76 figure that was too low, therefore,we had assumed on the basis of the rate demands for 1976/77 thatwhile some excess expenditure by local.authorities was likely -it would be small and would not amount to more than  100m overall.But it now turns out that they were adding to an already higher1975/76 total; and are planning for a further overspend as well.The annex to this letter sets out what the overspends are, service by service.   The figures in the annex are in November 1975 prices.They are probably inaccurate in some considerable degree - localauthorities do consistently over-estimate the expenditure theyarc likely to incur, and they may have allowed too much inflationin their budgets for individual services, and if they do not use the whole of this allowance, it may be transferred tobalances and benefit the rates in 1977/78.   We are having thefigures examined as a matter of urgency to see if we can formmore reliable estimate of likely local authority expenditure.Nevertheless, the prospect is of a substantial overspend of what has been provided in Cmnd. 6393 unless action is taken to restrain this.
I recognise how sensitive the revelation of a potential overspendof  300/ 500m might be.    It is bound to become public in due course:    the local authority associations have the figures alreadyand we shall have to say something about them at the meeting ofthe Consultative Council on 26 May.    (Officials will be meetingthe local authority associations at the Official Steering group on 13 May, and will also need to express extreme disquiet).    Ithink we should agree a line of action to make it clear that, whenthe excess becomes public, we are acting to make the public expenditure figures stick.    I do not think it would be sufficientsimply to pass the figures back to the local authorities and tell them that they must cut back their expenditure plans in 1976/77.There are the following possibilities:i., In addition to asking for expenditure to be cut back,.we could ask for a further return in, say two months1time which would show how local authorities intended to accomplish the necessary savings:   this would be a new development, and might be criticised as a new intervention by central government into the affairs of local authorities,but they would find it difficult to resist.    (Any lollow-up action against individual authorities, after we hadreceived the returns, would be much more difficult^.ii.   Yfe could say now that we will reduce the Rate support grant Increase Order for 1976/77 to take account of anyexcess.   We have provided  480m for this within the cashlimits towards possible inflation in 1976/77.   It would normally be decided on in November.   This would effect areduction in expenditure.   But it has some difficulties:to. say that I will make a reduced Increase Order, before Ihave information about price rises which I am bound by statute to consider, might leave us open to challenge.It would be grossly unfair, -since it would affect boththe authorities who had made big savings already and thosewho had not.    It would also add another element of uncertainty to the Rate Support Grant situation,which already suffers too much from this.iii.   We could say that the 1977/78 Rate Support Grant settlementwe shall be negotiating this autumn will be based on theassumption that the final outturn for 1976/77 has been kept down to the level implicit in the public expenditure figures, and that any excess would have been put to balancesand be available for next year&apos;s expenditures.   Thus thepercentage rate of RSG would be well do\m on that for thecurrent year.   This also would penalise &apos;good&apos; and &quot;bad1authorities alike, but not as badly as making no IncreaseOrder in the autumn.r
It is important that we should recognise that the local authorities will try to argue that the new figures merely reflect the costs of present policies after all the necessary economies have been made,and that the Cmnd 6393 figures are simply on too low a base.They can say that the increases do not involve Government payingany more in Rate Support Grant, or the ratepayers in higher rates than those already being levied.    They will themselves nodoubt argue that the figures are unreliably high, and thatve ought not to take precipitate action because of this - whichwill, of course, reinforce our demand for a further return, as suggested in para 4.i. above.   And if we press for cuts, ministers will have to say how these should be accomplished, for example toreduce expenditure in the particular services by the amount of excess shown in the Annex.Given the urgency of this, you may think it right to have ameeting of Ministers especially concerned very quickly.    I should perhaps say that, in the slightly longer term, I am sure we muststudy how we can prevent such large switches in expenditure coming to our notice in this way without warning.    But this is a question with considerable implications - not forgetting Layfield among them!I am sending copies to Roy Jenkins, Bruce Millan, John Morris,David Ennals, Fred Mulley and to Sir John Hunt.JPETER SHOREThe Rt Hon Joel Barnett MP
