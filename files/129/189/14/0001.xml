HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS government cp(76)14 COPY NO      8117 May 1976CABINETRATIFICATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANTS on human RIGHTS:  INDEPENDENT SCHOOLSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. The Home Affairs Committee, at their meeting on 12 May approved a proposal for early ratification by the United Kingdom of the InternationalCovenants on Human Rights which would be subject to a number ofderogations and reservations in respect of Northern Ireland and certain other issues of potential difficulty where there is a need to safeguard theUnited Kingdom interest.    In order to stand for election for a place fromthe outset on the United Nations Committee which will shortly be set up to supervise the implementation of the Covenants, it is very desirable that weshould ratify by 23 May.2.        The Committee were unable to reach a consensus of view on thequestion whether or not a reservation should be made in regard to Article 13of the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in order to retain the option of abolishing independent schools.    Paragraph 3 of this Article(of which the full text is at Annex A) requires States Parties to have respect for the liberty of parents to choose for their children schools other thanthose established by the public authorities; and paragraph 4 states that no part of the Article shall be construed so as to interfere with the liberty of individuals and bodies to establish and direct educational institutions.3.        If a reservation were made, it is proposed that it should read;&quot;The Government of the United Kingdom reserve the right to restrict to the public authorities the power to establish and conductschools,:I4.        In favour of a reservation on these lines, it was argued that the manifesto committed the Government to &quot;withdraw tax relief and charitablestatus from Public Schools, as a first step towards our long-term aim ofphasing out fee paying in schools&quot;; that to accept Article 13*3 without a reservation would inhibit a future Government from legislating to abolish1
independent schools; and that failure to make a reservation would, moreimmediately, cast doubt on the Government&apos;s willingness to carry out the specific undertaking to withdraw tax relief and charitable status. ,        Those Ministers who opposed a reservation did so on the grounds that the Manifesto commitment did not extend to the abolition of independent schools; that it was, in practice, unlikely that a future government would wish directly to prohibit such schools; and that thepolitical disadvantages of the domestic controversy which a reservationwould provoke would therefore greatly outweigh any practical as well aspresentational advantages vis-a-vis our own supporters,6.        There was also a further view, expressed by the Lord Advocate,that a wider reservation might be required (in relation to the religiousconvictions provision of Article 13.3) in order to enable a future government to secure the integration of Roman Catholic and non-denominational schools in the public sector in Scotland, if this seemedde undesirable,7.       In considering these potentially sensitive issues the Cabinet will wish to have in mind that Article 2 of the First Protocol to the EuropeanConvention on Human Rights, which the United Kingdom ratified in 1992,reads as follows:-&quot;Mo person shall be denied the right to education.   la the exerciseof any functions which it assumes in relation to education and toteaching, the state shall respect the right of parents to ensuresuch education and teaching in conformity with their ownreligious and philosophical convictions. &quot;8.        There are conflicting legal views on whether this Article, whichis binding on the United Kingdom, already guarantees a right of parentsto education for their children outside the State system.    Nevertheless,a legal sub-group of the recent working group of officials on Human Rights(which considered the possible incorporation of the European convention in United Kingdom domestic law) concluded that any attempt to restrict the freedom to establish and to educate children at independent schoolsmay be regarded as a contravention of the Article;  and this conclusion,I understand, is supported by obiter dicta of the European Commission,although the European Court has not given judgment in the relevantDanish case.9.        The terms of the Article also suggest that we are alreadyrestricted in relation to the point made by the Lord Advocate about the integration of public sector schools in Scotland.2
10. I Invite the Cabinet to decide whether or not a reservation shouldbe made in relation to Article 13 of the relevant Covenant on the lines ofparagraph 3 above.RHJHome Office17 May 19763
