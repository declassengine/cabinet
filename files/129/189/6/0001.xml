DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(76) 626 April 1976PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PROGRESS report note by the Chancellor of the exchequer attach a memorandum by the Chief Secretary reporting the serious situation which is developing through the accumulation of claims for additional expenditure, and through proposals which would erode orreverse decisions announced in our recent public expenditure white paper.    I fully endorse his view that we must make the White Paperplan stick and the proposals in his concluding paragraph which are designed to help in securing this objective.D W treasury Chambers26 April 1976COPY NO1CABINET
I am extremely concerned at the rapid erosion of the contingency reserve and the growing volume of claims for still further additional expenditure.In my two previous progress reports on the contingency reserve I have concentrated on 1976-77;   unless our White Paper plan is to be demonstrablyinvalidated almost from the outset our minimum objective must be to limit the claims on the reserve so that a credible balance is preserved until wecan review the position more fundamentally in the summer on the basis ofthe report on the 1976 public expenditure survey.   But the problem lor1977-78 and the later years is also becoming serious, particularly inview of various proposals which are now coming forward to relinquish someof the savings agreed and announced in the last White Paper.2.   In the enclosed tables I show once again the expenditure which wehave already agreed to meet out of the contingency reserve;    some minorproposals totalling  26 million in the current year which are now recommendeifor approval - details of these are set out in an Annex;    and the furtherclaims now known, to the Treasury.   The position for 1976-77 is set out in.one table and for the whole run of years up to 1979-80 in another.   Thefigures can be summarised in the following way:-  million1976-77 1977-781975 Survey    1976-77      1975 Survey		Prxces	Prices	prices.	White Paper contingency				reserve	700	875	9002.

3.    The main individual items involve large amounts for the nationalised industries to which I drew attention in my second progress report;  andnew problems concerning housing,  food subsidies and education.    In thesecases the proposals for 1977-78 would erode or reverse decisions for whickwe took credit in the White Paper.    If these reductions are foregone theywill use up the contingency reserve and add to expenditure no less thannew expenditure projects.    Moreover the figures assume that the reductionin civil service staff costs which we have announced will be secured.Nationalised industries and other industrial programmesk.      The most pressing proposals in the industrial field are furtherfinance for the coal stockpile,  support for the National freight corporation and additional capital for British Nuclear Fuels Limited, butwe  should not accept any commitment unless and until it is inevitable andeven then it must be kept to a minimum.    There are still further proposal3for additional finance for the National Coal Board and British steel corporation but I believe that these will have to be resisted.Housing5.      Expenditure on new housebuilding in England is now expected to be substantially larger than was planned in Cmnd 6393 and,  together with ahigher level of subsidy payments than forecast, will cost an extra 200 million in 1976-77*    While action to bring new housebuilding under control could ensure that the excess does not grow larger in 1976-77 (orin later years)  - and I recommend that we should study how this might bedone - only a severe cutback in new approvals could significantly reducethe prospective overspend.    It would however be possible to offset the 200 million by savings in other housing expenditure such as municipali-sation and local authority mortgage lending.    I know that by itself thiswould be politically unwelcome, but it would be justified in order tomake possible the increase in new housebuilding.    I consider it imperative that this should be done.6.      There are also potential claims of  142 million in 1977-78 and 270 million in 1978-79 on subsidies to local authority houses. Thebulk of these claims would not arise if legislation were introduced to achieve the reductions which we agreed in our recent review of public expenditure.    The previous Secretary of State has questioned whether thenecessary legislation should be taken in 1976-77 Session.    But I am surewe cannot agree to an addition of this size to housing expenditure as awhole.
&quot;1 wruuwrUUENTlALfood subsidies! 7,   The Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection has proposedthat, subject to a possible reduction in the butter subsidy, food subsidyrates should remain unchanged until the end of 1976-77.   This would costup to  100 million in 197&amp;-77 and. subject to the way it was carried forward into 1977-78, up to say  200 million in that year over and above the provision in Cmnd 6393-education 8.   With Cabinet agreement   Cmnd 6393 assumed that fees for overseasstudents would be increased from about 10 per cent of average costs toabout 45 per cent to secure savings of  42 million.   Proposals which theSecretary of State for Education is now considering seem likely to achieveless than half these savings.   It was also agreed that  15 million wouldbe saved by ensuring that students are in future denied independent access to social security benefits.   Legislation will be necessary, however, tosecure this and a firm decision to go ahead with it must be made soon.    Inthe absence of such legislation, not only will the  15 million not be saved but there would also be some  7 million expenditure, additional toCmnd 63931 due to much easier qualification conditions for unemploymentbenefit from January 1977.i Civil Service Numbers9.   We shall shortly he discussing ways of achieving the  140 million cutcivil service costs inin/19/8-79 which we announced - and took credit for - in the Februarypublic expenditure White Paper.   Since then, however, other proposals for extra manpower have come forward, and it will clearly be difficult to offset these on top of finding the  140 million to which we are committed.If so, any net additional demands which are approved will be a claim onthe contingency reserve.    (At present a provisional estimate of thoseadditional requirements is  60 million in 1978-79, but not all of thisis yet reflected in the enclosed tables.)   And if we did not succeed inidentifying savings equal to the full  140 million, any shortfall on that amount would of course likewise be a claim on the reserve.confidential.
Options10.    In this situation there are three options open to us:(i) allow the contingency reserve to be exhaustedand total public expenditure to exceed the planned levels which we have published;(ii) keep within the contingency reserve by refusingall but the most essential items;(iii) seek to limit claims on the contingency reserveby obtaining offsetting savings.The first of these courses would discredit our economic planning and itwould do immense damage at home and overseas.    It seems to me to beunthinkable.11.    I have therefore, with my officials,  examined the claims in Table 1item by item to assess the extent to which they will need to be accepted^Some are clearly very strong, but others are only contingent or could be deferred or rejected outright.    I conclude that, by the most vigorousapplication of the second and third courses,  set out in my previous paragraph, we could carry on within the existing contingency reserveuntil we are able to look again at the picture as a whole,  for 1976-77 ft5well as the later years, when we have the report on the 1976 Survey.Conclusions12.    To achieve this,  and to prevent the plans which we have announced **3recently as February from being discredited, we must limit any new clai013to those of the very highest priority and even then obtain offsetting savings wherever possible.    In particular,  the positive steps which we need to take now are as follows, and I invite the Cabinet to approvethem.(i)      The Secretary of State for the Environment shouldbe invited to bring forward, in consultation with me,  specific measures designed to offset in full the prospective housing increases now reported for 1976-77and to report back to the Cabinet.
(ii)    The Secretary of State for the Environment shouldbe  invited to  arrange  for an urgent  study,   inconsultation with the Treasury and with the otherHousing Departments,   of arrangements  to  bringexpenditure on house-building under control  and to bringproposals before Cabinet for decision.(iii)    The Secretaries of State responsible for the nationalised industries and other industrialprogrammes  to  examine relevant items  in the tables critically with a view to limiting themto those of the highest priority,  and to reducingthe cost of these to the absolute minimum.(iv)     The  Secretary of State  for Education should beinvited to implement the agreed reductions inthe education programme or to offer othersavings  to keep within the White Paper figures.(v)    The Secretary of State for the Social services should be invited to bring forward proposalsfor achieving the savings on the payment of social security benefits to students.(vi)    We may need to look again later at the timetable for phasing out food subsidies,  but meanwhile the White Paper programme should stand.(vii)    The net cost of the child benefit scheme shouldbe kept to  65 million,  that is,  the level which I have proposed in paragraph 7 of cp(76)5.CONFIDENTIAL
