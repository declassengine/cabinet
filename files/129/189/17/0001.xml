THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S government cp(76) 17 COPY KO      8114 May 1976CABINETSTEEL CLOSURES REVIEW:   SHOTTONMemorandum &quot;by Secretary of State for IndustryIn his memorandum reporting on the recent discussion on Shotton in theEconomic and Industrial Committee (El) (CP(76) 11) the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer has outlined the two options originally presented to Eland the third option introduced during our discussion in El Committee.Some of the important considerations which led me to recomoend Option IIto my colleagues are not covered in the memorandum and I think cabinet should take these into account in reaching decisions on this difficultissue.^INDUSTRIAL CASE FOR OPTION II2.     If I had though a course of action could be justified which permittedthe expansion of Port Talbot to go ahead at the same time as the constructionof a new steel plant at Shotton, I would have recommended it unhesitatinglyto my colleagues in El.   However, my examination of the alternativesconvinced me that on grounds of capital cost and excess capacity such acourse was ruled out as an industrial solution.3.     In my view the economic arguments in favour of Option I set out inparagraph 6 of the chancellors paper are subject to important qualifioa-tions which are not mentioned there.   Thus, it says that the oost per tonneof the additional liquid steel capacity in Option I would be 15 per centless.   But this is subsumed in the production cost of the hot rolled coilmade from the liquid steel.   Paragraph 6 says this is 5i per eent lower inOption I.   However, when officials examined all the options last year,they noted that Option I would be more vulnerable to disrupted production(eg by labour disputes) than Option II, because all production would be concentrated in one plant.   They concluded that this and other vulner-abilities of Option I should be reflected in the figures for productioncost and suggested that variations in assumptions might reduce theproduction cost advantage of Option I over Option II to  2,8/tonne, or only 3 per cent of the average production cost.   Again, paragraph 6 says that output per man is almost 20 per cent higher (in Option i).   Butestimates of future productivity provide no assuranoe that these productionlevels will be achieved in practice;   the track record of the workforceshas to be taken into account.   Port Talbot*s reoord, as indioated forexample in the damaging strike earlier this year, inspires no confidence1
that the high productivity figures estimated for Option I represent the likely outcome of future dependence on the one plant.   The Shotton work-force   on the other hand, has an outstanding record of freedom fromdisputes.   Even in terms of capital cost, the difference between the options may no longer be as shown in Annex A to the Chancellors paper.We know that the BSC arc continuing to examine the cost of Option I andtheir latest estimate for it, at September 1975 prices, contains a specialcontingency element of  80 million which would represent an increase in real terms over the September 197*t- estimate.4.    These represent significant qualifications to the apparent strengthof the economic and industrial case for Option I.   And, against that case,qualified as it needs to be, I would set what I consider the real industrialadvantages of Option II -a. with a new steel plant with 2a?5 ndllion tonnes capacity, asproposed by the workforce, Shot con would be an efficient and modernsteel producer,   BSC have effectively admitted that suoh a plantwould supply Shotton1 s own finishing end with hot rolled coilcosting no more and probably marginally less than the coil transportedfrom Port Talbot in Option I.   So this is not a matter of&apos; perpetuating steel production (in North Wales) on an uneconomicbasis1 as has buen suggested.  A new hot rolling mill would certainly not be needed in the present round of investment at Shotton;b. wo would continue to make use of the 3kills of a traditionalsteelmaking comounity with a proven record of good labour relations and undisrupted production;c. by continuing to make this element of BSC&apos;s strip mill output in two modern plants instead of one we would have better protection against disruption to supply whether from technical problems,transport difficulties (the need to carry coke from Shotton to PortTalbot and hot rolled coil from Port Talbot to Shotton) or labour disputes.   This would be a valuable insurance for steel consumingindustries.SOCIAL AND EMPLOYMENT CASE FOR OPTION II5. Up to now Shotton has been heavily dependent upon steel jobs! BSCprovides 60 per cent of the male manufacturing employment in the travel to work area. Both Shotton, whose male unemployment rate has increasedby 146 por cent in the last 2 years, and on a much greater scaleMerseyside, have suffered substantial blows to employment over the past-12 months.   These are described in the Annexes to this paper.6.     The task of replacing the jobs already lost to Shotton and on Merseysidewill be difficult enough.   Even in Option II we have the prospect of adding to our problem with 2 00 redundancies from BSC, but the local unions areprepared to accept this as the price for securing a long term future forsteelmaking in the area.   To increase the direct and indirect loss of jobs2
by a further WK), as would bo implied by selecting Option 1, would in my view make it impossible - in spite of all our efforts and of BSC*s - forus to provide alternative employment over the next five years on the scaleneeded to alleviate the social hardship we would be causing in the Shottonarea.   In addition, the action we took to help Shotton would be increasinglyat the expense of other Assisted Areas, most probably Merscysido, where theproblems of unemployment and its social consequences remain very severe.7.     Option I would also face us with some difficult and far reaching decisions about the direction of our regional development policies.   If we wanted to be seen to be doing all in our power to help Shotton, we would find it hard to resist calls to upgrade it from its present IntermediateArea status;   indeed, there would be pressure to make it a Special development area (SDA.).   Not only would this have a limited effect on the real problemof job replacement, given the competition from existing SDAs, but it wouldalso lead to renewed pressure from other areas for ohangoa in Assisted Areaboundaries which we have hitherto been able to resist.   Such changes wouldin turn dilute the overall effectiveness of our regional strategy unlessaccompanied by some down-grading - for instance, of Aberdeen and the surrounding area - which would raise other political difficulties,CLOSURE REVIEW8.     In deciding that Option II is the course we should adopt, I have beenguided above all by the objectives we set ourselves in establishing the review of bsc&apos;s closure programme.   We considered that the plans agreed bythe Concervativcs did not take enough account of the social effects ofmaking people redundant in areas heavily depondent on steel industryemployment.   In some cases there were also real doubts about the econondoarguments used by BSC to justify closure.   Our review was intended to takea more balanced view of tho economic case and a more compassionate view ofthe social implications of what BSC planned.   In the light of these aims and of the points to which I have drawn attention above, I strongly recommend Option II to my colleagues.EVDepartment of Industry14 May 19763
EMPLOYMENT PROBLEMS IN THE SHOTTON AREAUntil recently Shotton enjoyed a relatively low unemploymentrate (see detailed figures in Annex B).   But in the past twoyears (roughly the period covered by the closure review) the male unemployment rate has increased by 146% and it is nowsubstantially higher than the average for Great Britain.   OnMerseyside the male rate at 12.5% is one of the highest inthe country, and there are now nearly 60,000 males (75,000 total)unemployed.   By comparison the male rate in Port Talbot hasincreased only by around 50% and has improved from being slightlyabove the GB average in April 1974 to being sensibly below ittoday.2      Among the reasons for the increase in unemployment and for theprospects of further unemployment around Shotton are:(a) CourtauldsAt one time the company provided 15% of the malemanufacturing jobs in the Deeside area but it has beenreducing its labour force over the last two years.It recently announced the &quot;mothballing&quot; of one of itsGreenfield plants (involving 600 jobs - 400 to be maderedundant and 200 redeployed under a worksharing scheme)and there is no certainty about the long-term future ofthe Deeside plant (1000 employees).(b) Hawker SiddeleyHawker Siddeley provides about one-third of the malemanufacturing jobs in the Chester area.   The prospects for maintaing employment in the next three years are good but, beyond that, much will depend on receipt oforders.(c) Tillie &amp; HendersonThe firm (which makes light clothing) has been placedin the hands of a Receiver, putting 575 jobs at riskin the Clwyd/Chester area.   Trading continues at presentand financial assistance has been sought from thisDepartment.3 On Merseyside also there are problems in a number of individual industries, but on a much larger scale:(a)   telecommunications - as a result of the cutback in post Office orders, 900 redundancies were announced by Plessey in February this year;
electronics - the closure of the Thorn factory inSkelmersdale resulted in the loss of 1,400 jobs;flass - there have been 750 redundancies atilkington&apos;s Ravenhead plant;shipbuilding - the report of the inter-departmentalgroup included the possibility of substantial joblosses at Cammell Laird, if measures to secureorders prove unsuccessful, jobs were also lost atWestern Shiprepairers;sugar - there is uncertainty as to the future of jobs at the Liverpool refinery of Tate and Lyle.
