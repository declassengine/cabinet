CONFIDENTIALPOLICY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY POTENTIALLONGER TERM SAVINGS?Memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the TreasuryAt our discussion of public expenditure on11 December 1975 (CC(75) 55th Conclusions, Minute 2, conclusion 1U)the Secretary to the Cabinet was asked to consider ways ofIdentifying potential policy changes which would lead to public expenditure savings but would only come to fruition in the longerten.    This natter was raised again at Cabinet on 26 March(CC(76) 12th Conclusions, Minute3) when it was agreed that this work should be pressed ahead.2.    Following discussion of this remit at official level, itwas agreed that the best way of handling it was to marry it up with the next PAR programme and to give us an opportunity todiscuss a fairly wide range of topics before the PAR programme is finally settled.     In rolling forward the programme to cover the period 1976-78, particular attention has been given therefore to possible subjects for study, whether within or outside PAH,which could lead to longer term savings.3.     I am therefore putting forward for my colleagues&apos; approvalthe PAR programme set out in Annex I.     It has been drawn upby the interdepartmental Committee on Programme Analysis and review (PARC) and has my approval.     To set the programmeagainst a wider background. Annex II lists other major policystudies which departments are proposing over the next three years.A list of PAR options is included in Annex III.     These are subjects which are prims facie suitable for PAR reviews but on which thedepartments concerned would have reservations.4.    In addition to all these proposed studies the Lord Privy Sealhas drawn attention to the need for studies of manpowerIntensive activities in the memorandum on &quot;Cutting the Cost of/the
the Civil Service&quot; (CP(76)9) which the Cabinet considered laBt week.These are to include a study, under arrangements to be agreed with theSecretary of State for Social Services, of ways of making savings on the administration of personal taxation and of social security benefits with particular regard to areas where these systems overlap,5*     We must recognise that policy reviews put a burden on scarceresources of Departmental manpower.     But in general the studieslisted in the Annexes are concentrated on areas involvingsignificant amounts of expenditure and/or manpower resources, andmoat of them will be undertaken in the expectation that   a thoroughreview could lead either to savings (of expenditure and/or manpower)or increased effectiveness.     In principle the need for such reviewsis greater rather than less when resources are under severe constraint,and it would be counter-productive if we failed to make every effort to find the relatively small staff resources required.6.     I ask my colleagues to endorse the PAR programme set out in annex I, to take note of the list of other policy studies in annex II, and to consider whether any of the options in Annex IIIshould also be studied, within PAR or otherwise.JBM Treasury
ANNEX IPAR PROGRAMME 1976-78PART ISTUDIES ARRANGED BY SUBJECT(Lend Deportment noted after title.   The Treasury and Central policy review Staff are concerned with every study and the Civil service department when their interests are involved.   Other Departments withan interest are noted at the end of each description.)1.     THE ECONOMY (Industry, Agriculture, Trade, Employment, Research)a. Studies completed but not yet submitted to Ministers collectivelyi.     Farm Structure PolicyReport completed.b. Studies in progressi. Regional Industrial Policy (Din - continuing from 1975)In 1976-77 expenditure is forecast to be around  575m.   The PARis concentrating on incentives in regional policy, though alsotaking into account effects of infrastructure investment.   the far will examine the relative merits of encouraging mobility of firms by capital and labour subsidies and of labour.   The effect-iveness of past measures will be examined, and it is hoped thata preliminary assessment can be made of the effects of the 197?Industry Act.   The results may be of some help in working out the uk&apos;s approach to the e.c. regional policy measures.   The workstarted in 1975, is continuing in 1976, and it is expected thatthe Report will be available after the Summer Recess.   (DEm, DOE,SO, WO, CSO).ii. Fisheries (MAFF - 1976-1978) 21m in 1976-77.   This is in two parts.   The first is on theimmediate issues arising in current international negotiations and will help to clarify HMG&apos;s policy objectives and options forCONFIDENTIAL1
those negotiations.   The second part will cover government support and policy hearing on the fishing industry, with parti-cular regard for the effect of the UN Conference on the Law ofthe Ren and for the development of the common fisheries policyof the e.c..   This stage cannot he tackled until the outcome ofthese international developments is known, and completion is not therefore expected until 1078.    (DAFS, DANI, FCO).Proposed Studiesi. Energy Conservation (DEn: 1977)A final decision on undertaking this review will be taken later.The study is not costable.    Its purpose would be to assess theeffects of the energy conservation measures already implementedand to consider whether existing measures could be made more effective and whether new measures should be introduced.    (Din,DOE and some cooperation from most other Departments).ii. Government R&amp;D Post-Rothschild (Cabinet Office - 1977)^A review of the experience and effectiveness of post-Rothschildarrangements and whether any further work should be done in thelight of this.   Total Government expenditure on E&amp;D in 1975-76was some  1205m.    (Din, DES, DHSS, MOD, DOE, MAFF, DEn, SO).iii. Industrial R&amp;D (Din - Provisional for 1977)^The scope of this study has not been defined; it might coversuch questions as whether the results of research are adoptedsufficiently rapidly by industry, and whether adequate economicand industrial benefits are obtained from R&amp;D expenditure,(Expenditure on general industrial R&amp;D and industrial and technological-logical sponsorship - excluding aerospace - was about  40m in1975-76).iv. Animal Health Policy (MAFF - 1978)Expenditure in GB is estimated at  54m in 1976-77 falling to 22m in 1978-79 as a nationwide programme of brucellosiseradication nears completion.   The studyCONFIDENTIAL
would cover all areas of animal health arrangements directed towards the improvement of agricultural productivity.    (DAFS).NOTESThe precise arrangements for and organisation of these two R and Dstudies will need to be worked out between the Department ofIndustry and the Cabinet Office when the scope of, and responsi-bility for the Zuckermann Review are clearer.i. Two studies noted as possible 1978 reviews were (i) a reviewof current UK and e.c. policy towards hill farming, and (ii.) afurther review of Agricultural Strategy as justified after thelapse of time since Cmnd 60?0, on UK food policy.   The case for both these reviews will be considered next year.ii. There is a need for some analytical stocktaking review afterthe upturn, of counter cyclical measures, both employment and investment.   Employment aspects may however be covered by the interdepartmental Manpower Group.   The situation will be consideredagain next year to see whether a review should be undertaken inone combined study or otherwise.
THE ENVIRONMENTStudies completed but not yet submitted to Ministers collectivelyHil-Studies in progressi. Review of Housing Finance (DOE and SO. continuing from 1975)*3500m in 1975-76 plus tax relief on mortgages.   A long-termcomprehensive review of the existing system of housing finance in both the public and private sectors in conjunction with otherdepartments concerned.   The review is based on an objectiveeconomic analysis of the working of the housing market.   (WO, IB,BBSS, DEm, Din).   The separate but parallel review being carriedout in Scotland is linked with the DOE review, particularly inrelation to owner occupation and mortgage lending.   The Departmentof the Environment had hoped to complete the review and publish a consultative document this summer, but that will not now bepossible until later in the year.   A Green/ White Paper (forScotland) is possible for summer/autumn.ii. Transport Policy Review (DOE. Continuing from 1975) 2400m in 1975-76.   A review of the whole of inland surface transport in Great Britain.   A Consultative Document has been published.   The Secretary of State has indicated that there shouldbe a Government statement after the summer recess, (DFCP; Din;AT; DEn; SO; WO).-Proposed studies*-    Review of the Working of the Rent Acts in the light of theBousing Finance Review (DOE and SO - 1976)following on from the Housing Finance Review.   (MO, IR).ii.   Anti-Pollution Policy (DOE - 1977 - BmwiiiiMuil(This review will not take place if the Royal Commission recommenda-tioa for a Pollution Inspectorate is implemented.)A study of all aspects of pollution and a review of the effective-hesa of anti-pollution measures, with particular reference to thearrangements for clean air and water, the disposal of solid andtoxic wastes, and the wide-ranging problem of noise.   (SO, WO, DI,&amp;Eu, DHSS; DT; DEn).4
iii. Settlement Patterns in Declining Areas (DOE - 1978 -Provisional)The study would be a follow-up to the PAB on Rural Depopulationand would examine evidence on the success of the policy of concentrating population growth and development in selectedsettlements in sparsely populated areas as a means of counteringrural depopulation.   It would consider the feasibility of adoptingthis policy more widely.   The case for this study will bere considered in the light of further research, some of which isalready started, as it may be more appropriate for the subject totake the form of a research project rather than a full-scalepolicy review.   (SO, UO, Din, MAFF, DEm, Forestry Comm).iv. Urban Deprivation II (BO - Provisional - Open date)This study, as a follow-up to the completed Stage I, is in abeyance pending the outcome of the DOE study on Inner City Areas,and Ministerial decision on how follow-up action should be organised.   (DOE, SO, WO, DEm, DHSS).i.     A review of Inter Urban Public Passenger Transport,originally envisaged ae a PAR study for 1976, is one of the specific issues which the proposed National Transport council might commission when it has been set up.   The PARC Committeehas some reservations on the possible delay that thia: might entail.The prospects for this study, and for it being undertakenprincipally by the Department of the Environment, on commissionif need be from the National Transport Council, should thereforebe kept under review.5
3.      EDUCATION AND TRAININGa.     Studies completed but not yet submitted to Ministers collectivelyi.     Post Graduate Loans (DES)Completed last year but not yet discussed by ministers collectively.^*     Studies in progressi. Finance and Control of Non-University Higher Education inEngland and Wales (DES - 1975 not yet completed)About  550m in 1975-1^76, rising to  60Cm in 1980-81.   The aim off the review is to consider whether changes should be made inthe method of financing and controlling non-university institutions of higher education in England and Wales.   (WO). Completion has been deferred by the Department pending clarification of the implications-tions of the Layfield Report and devolution proposals.   Thisdeferment has been considered by the PARC Committee.   While boththe responsible Department and Central Departments are in agreement on the need to complete this PAR, there is disagreement on itstiming, the Central Departments favouring completion at an earlydate, the DES favouring further deferment.ii. Financial Control and Institutional Structure of higher education Sector (SEP 1^75 - Not yet completed) 60 m in 1^75-76 and in 1978-79-   The aim of the study is to review the structure and organisation of the higher education sector in Scotland, including the relationship betweeninstitutions of higher education and central and local governmentand to consider what measures might be necessary to improve thecoordination of provision of higher education.    Again, as for thecorresponding review in England and Wales, the Department isdeferring completion, and consider it premature to do otherwise,whereas the Central Departments consider that it should becompleted at an early date.
iii. School Building (DEB - 1975/6)Capital expenditure on schools is  375m in 1975-76, falling to 200m in 1980-81.   The element for improvement is  31m forstarts in 1975-76 falling to  16m in 1980-81.   The study iscovering the replacement and improvement programme for primary and secondary school building.   A central aim is to establish a systematic long-term approach to the problem of renewing thecountry&apos;a school building.   In preparation for the review, a sample survey of existing school buildings was conducted.   TheReport is expected this Summer.   (SED, WO, DOE).Studies proposed. Student Residence (DES 1976)This review will re-examine the proposition that ths supply ofprivate lodgings is unlikely to match the expected rise in thestudent population and to consider the means for encouragingmore students to live at home, and other possible ways ofalleviating this problem (SED).ii. Non-Teaching Costs (SED - 1978) 120m in 1975-76 falling to  118m in 1979-80.   This study willexamine this large element (about 30%) of recurrent expenditureon schools and will look in particular at policy on the employmentof non-teacher staff.7
HEALTH AKP SOCIAL WELFARE: SOCIAL SUBJECTS GENERALLYStudies completed but not yet submitted .to Ministers collectivelyIn 1Studies in progress1,     Priorities within the Health and Personal Social Services(DHSS - continuing from 1975) 5,285m in 1975-76.   A comprehensive study of health and personal social services priorities.   A forward programme budget has been produced to assist in the selection of options.A Consultative Document has been published.   The PAR will identify the main issues and the conclusions recommended.    (SO, WC).li.   &quot;Advisory Services for Citizens (DPCP - continuing from 1975)A preliminary study, continuing from 1975* is surveying the purposes and extent of existing services and their inter-relationships.Citizens&apos; Advice Bureaux, consumer advice centres, trading standardsdepartments, law centres, housing advice centres are among those covered.   A concurrent survey by the National Consumer councils now awaited.   Once this is available, a decision will be taken on whether to proceed to a review of priorities for future develop-ment, and of the scope for coordinating and rationalising activities in this field, and on the nature of the review (PAH or otherwise),(LCO, DOE, HO, DHSS, SO, WO, CSD, DEm).iii. *DiBtribu-fc-&apos;ft&quot;*i Effects of Expenditure Pi-n^wm.^(Treasury - continuing from 1975)A preliminary interdepartmental Report by a Working Party ofeconomists and statisticians has been completed, examining the feasibility of and recommending on a common classification system for data on distributional effects.   Provisional views on the scopeof the PAR are that it should deal with (a) the distributional
effects of new policy proposals rather than those of existing programmes, (b) that it should relate to income and social economicgroups, not to regional aspects and (c) it should concentrateprimarily on the main social expenditures which bear directly onincome distribution.   The confirmation of this approach and thescope for its further development and possible application will need to be discussed at the PARC Sub Committee set up to conductthis PAR.    (DPCP, DOE, DEm, Din. IR, MAFF, DES, DHSS, HO, SO, WOCSO).c. Studies proposed. Economic Effects of Food Subsidies (Provisional)(DPCP - 1976A0 576m in 1973-76.   If some food subsidies seem likely to remainin the longer term, consideration will be given to an examinationof their economic effects on food production and processing, prices and profits, food distribution, and the balance of payments etc.   Theneed for a PAR will be reviewed before starting it.     (HA??).ii. &quot;Relative Need a forr  and Standards of Public RmrvirM^ jnEngland. Scotland. Wales and Northern Ireland(Treasury - 1976/7)Paragraph 100 of the White Paper &quot;Our Changing Democracy;   devolution to Scotland and Wales&quot; (Cmnd 6348) stresses the importance ofobjective information on standards of and needs for public services in Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland, for the purposeof negotiating the block grants which are proposed as the basisof the financial system under devolution.   This PAR will be under-taken in this context.   It will consider existing measures ofrelative need and output for services likely to be devolved inEngland, Scotland and Wales;   and for the corresponding services in Northern Ireland;   what resources could be devoted to collectingevidence of relative costs, and the longer term prospects forrelating needs to expenditure.   (DOE, SO, WO, BIO, DHSS, DES HO,DEm).^   Host associating Departments have reservations on the possiblemanpower demands for their input to thi s PAR,
iii. N.H.S. Capital Programme - (DHSS - 1Q?7 - Provisional&apos;)_ ?85m in 1975-76.   Following the review of priorities within the health and personal social services, particular areas are to be selected for detailed review.   This is the first such selection.It would review the cost of different elements in the healthprogramme, the scope for redeploying stock, the balance betweennew provision, improvement and replacement and the overall balance between capital and revenue account.   (DOE).iv. NHS Manpower Supply and Demand (DHSS - 1978 - Provisional) ?760min 1975-76.   This is the second particular area for studyfollowing the review of priorities within the health and personal social services.    It would consider the demand for the various categories of NHS manpower implied by expenditure projections,the supply likely to be available and the relationship with thecountry1s supply of manpower including that of part-time staff.(PEm).NOTES/Most Departments associating with this FAR on relative needs for and standards of public services in devolved regions have expressed somereservations on the possible manpower demands which their contributions to this review might impose on them.10J
5.     LAV. ORDER AND PUBLIC SAFETYa. Studies completed but not yet submitted to Ministers collectivelyNilb. Studies ip Progressi.     Custodial Care of Offenders (HO - Continuing from 1975) I6?m, in 1975-6 of which the staff element is  88m.   The custo-dial care of offenders, for which the prison service is principallyresponsible, has always been a highly labour-intensive activity.Trends in penal policy indicate this is not likely to changewithin the next few years.   The object of this PAR is to considerthe demands for manpower in the prison service in the light bothof recent developments in penal policy and of present forecasts of the supply conditions in the appropriate labour markets.Completion is expected soon.    (LCO, MOD, DHSS, DEm, NIO, SO, WO).c. Proposed studiesi.     Fire (HO -1976-1979) 215m on the fire services in 1975-76 plus a further sum forfire prevention measures in the public sector.   The study will consider the aims of fire prevention, fire protection, fire fight-ing and salvage, the distribution of resources between these activities, and their cost-effectiveness.   It will also cover the wider aspects of fire prevention measures and fire losses inthe private sector.   This wide ambit makes it necessary to extend the time scale over 4 years to 1979, and therefore some form of progress reporting will be necessary.   (DEm, DOE, MAFP, DI, SO,WO, Forestry Commission).11CONFIDENTIAL
6.     DEFENCE AND OVERSEAS COMMITMENTSa. Studies completed but not yet submitted to Ministers collectivelyNilb. Studies in Progressi. Projecting Britain Overseas (FCO continuing from 1975) 65m in 1975-76.   Primarily a review of expenditure on overseas information, in&amp;uding the allocation of funds to the externalservice of the BBC, the British Council and the information services of the FCO (including the supporting COI and HMSOexpenditure).   (DT, HMSO, COI).   A Report has been prepared andits handling in relation to the CPES review of overseas representation is under consideration.ii. Aspects of British Policy for Overseas Development FollowingEntry into Europe (ODM 1976)This study will consider the effect of UK membership of theEuropean Community on our overseas aid, and the options for meeting our overseas development objectives and our Communityobjectives.   (FCO, DT, Din).c. Studies proposedNil12
7.     CENTRAL GOVERNMENT - COMMON SERVICES AND organisation . Studies completed but not yet submitted to Ministers collectivelyNilb. Studies in progressi.     Review of Cost in use Implications of Capital Investment inBuildings (PSA - DOE - Continuing from 1975 244m in 1975-76 on the provision, operation and maintenance ofpublic buildings.   The review is studying the relationship betweencapital investment in buildings for which the PSA is responsibleand their cost in use with particular reference to offices and housing for the Armed Services.   The primary aim is to developtechniques to optimise this relationship and to explore the impli-cations for future building types and expenditure patterns.Progress is good and an early Report expected.c. Studies proposed.     Investment in Computers for Administrative Purposes (CSD -1977) 35m in 1975-76.   Timing will dependent on the completion of the review of computer procurement.   This study would as a first phaseassess some past decisions for investment in computers for admini-strative purposes against the results in terms of greater efficiencyor staff saving.   In the second phase, issues for further studywould be identified, leading to consideration of whether the criteria for investment decisions should be changed, and in that case, evolving improved criteria for new investment decisions.(User Departments concerned).NOTEi.     The case for a study on Civil Service Training will beconsidered later in the light of the current Management Review ofthe Civil Service Department.

CQHFIDE8TIALANNEX IIIPAS OPTIONS*h* following list sets out subjects which have been considered aspossible PAH reviews, but on which agreement has not been reached, forthe reasons set down against each.   They therefore represent possibleoptions for studies, for Ministerial consideration, whether as PAR orotherwise.   The Department appropriate to lead any review is noted In brackets after each title.   The Departments concerned point out that, inAddition to the considerations noted against each subject below, theheavy demands on manpower made by the PAH programme and other currentstudies is an added factor to be taken into account in considering thevorits of these further possible studies.(i)   Future development of Higher Education (Department of education and Science, Scottish Education Department associating).3otal expenditure on higher education, including Universities, colleges of Education, Polytechnics and other advanced/further educationInstitutions in 1975-76 was  1621m.   The review could consider relativerates of growth within the higher education sector of Colleges in thenon-university field (for further education and teacher training), oftraditional Universities and of the Open University.*ne Department of Education and Science consider that this will not be* suitable subject for a PAR study.   The subject is under constant study,*hd policy under continuous review, in the public expenditure context.** successive sacrifices of future higher provision are made to meetthe requirements of public expenditure policy, the scope for expansion*nd for policy choice within this programme is reduced to near thePoint of elimination.   The possibility of coherent longer term planning*t present is further reduced by uncertainty about the outcome andplications of the Lay field Report and of devolution proposals; andin the opinion of the Department of Education and Science, there is no***** for a FAR study until there is some prospect of a return to circumstances that make longer term planning possible in this area.Z4.
The Central Dep:a-W3Eis however would see souie merit in a stucy.It cannot be- expected that events will ever stand still for   PAR,and there could be some benefit from a view on options for &quot;yuieancein relation to current changing circumstances.(ii) - school 1 ^*ji.Or-panis-rbior;, Control and Administration.Total expenditure on schools an 1975-76 wes  381&apos;im.   The potentialscope foi&apos; study in this ares is vide.   It could be concerned withanalysing the reasons for, and justification of, criticise ij-cd a variety of., moderate sources (parerrus, employers etc) on the failureof the present system to respond sufficiently to social and cconorriruobjectives and change.   It would not be concerned with curriculumprescription but questions would arise as to whether the presentmachinery for curriculum development and control is sufficient!;,responsive, and on options for improving it.   This subject is also being put forward in the context of the CPHS review of the social service?; as -justifying review.,  he D3S does not accept the casethe issut^ifor a study but is renay wxtnout cornmita&amp;nt to discusr/on a bilater;basis with   Central Departments.(iii) 16-19 sKe group (Department of Education and Science).This review would not be concerned with the extension of education/training of early school leavers which was a main subject of therecent &quot;Getting Ready for Work&quot; PAR; it would relate to educationalarrangements for those who stay on at school past 16 or move into further education.   The Department of Education and Science hasdoubts about this but would be ready to consider without coraaitnentwith the GPRS a possible area for study (including the scope if anyfor savings by avoiding overlaps or duplication).(iv) Iit:;;i:lr-rct ion Policy (Kom? Office).tillE would be a review of policy on control of immigration :cclcv;ccto the labour market, Lousier and other considerations; i&apos;- r     confidential &apos;
examine the likely settlement patterrr, of sdei tiona.1. iiv^Lrfrcov-v,and ways of influericin^ then.The Department considers that a PATi review w^a1];] be in^^propri -ylvat a time when it is intending to undertake its own do::-:.tic re^-ie^of immigration law; they would ho prepared, to undertaha a system:i;u- i.; loanalysis of all the issues in the course of their own review erd to&quot;associate the Central 2opari;uents with it.The Central Departments consider that the interests of i-ianyDepartments are involved, that the review would have importantimplication a for expenditure on Civil Service manpower arid relatedadministration, and that an inter-departmental reviewed; of a PAI?character would be desirable to ensure that the policy options to&quot;be considered should not he unduly .constrained(v) Police Manpower - in) dating of ^9?^ review (Korea Office)[Total cost in *1975-76 was i-yy-Avi.   The i&quot;oiuc Office go not support this proposal; the last review produced only minor recor^endati or.^and left little over for further study; and no hotter ways ravebeen found of aeasuring police effectiveness or of cojitroilir.^:establishments.    Ehc Central Departments consider however that thesubject would well nerit further study, in vie-,; of the recent ra].d dincrease in police recruitcient and the possibility of changesfollowing the Layiieid Eeport.?6
