THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) U COPY NO    SI10 May 1976CABINETSTEEL CLOSURES REVIEW; SHOTTONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer, Since we returned to office in 1974 we have been carrying out ourearlier commitment to review the closures involved In the British steel corporation^ (BSC) modernisation programme.    The ministerial committee on Economic and Industrial Affairs ( 1) recently considered thefuture of Shotton, with which is linked bsc&apos;s development proposals forPort Talbot.    In view of the importance of the decision I undertook to reportto the Cabinet the considerations involved and the Committee^ conclusions.I am also incorporating in this paper the answers to questions which thePrime Minister raised at the time of the discussion in El.THE POSSIBLE OPTIONS2.        Shotton at present carries out all the stages of steel production.Its coke ovens and finishing plant are modern and efficient, but itssteelmaking plant is technically obsolete and will soon become economicallyuncompetitive.    BSC propose to close the iron and steelmaking plant andthe hot rolling mill in 1980-81 and to replace the capacity by expansion at port Talbot, raising steelmaking capacity there from 3 million tonnes perannum (mtpa) to 5. 75 mtpa.   Shotton would continue coke production andfinishing operations, using hot rolled coll supplied from Port Talbot.(Option I).    During the review of bsc&apos;s proposal a variety of other possible courses have been examined, including proposals by the Shotton workers.The Secretary of State for Industry has concluded that the beat course wouldbe to build a new steelmaking plant at Shotton with a capacity of 2. 25 mtpaand to modernise other parts of the plant.    This scheme was put forward by the Shotton workforce.   If this scheme were implemented, he considersthat only a marginal increase in Port Talbofs steelmaking capacity could then be justified in the light of bsc&apos;s sales prospects for strip millproducts.    (Option II).1
3.        In the discussion at El tho Lord President asked for considerationof the third course - Option III - which, the Prime Minister has also askedshould be considered.    This would involve the full expansion at Port Talbotenvisaged under Option X as well as the construction of the same steelmakingplant at Shotton as under Option II but with less modernisation of other facilities so that the resulting capacity would be limited to 1*8 mtpa.4.       Under all three Options there would lie substantial investment at port Talbot to modernise other equipment.5. At Annex A is a table which sets out, as far as possible on a commonbasis, the main facts about these 3 options.THE CONSIDERATIONS6.        The economic arguments favour Option I rattier than Option XL,Under Option I -a. The cost per tonne of additional liquid steel capacity is15 per cent lower.b. Output per man is almost 20 per cent higher; andc. production cost per tonne of hot rolled coil is 5$ per centlower.7.        Option IL however, gives rise to less serious social problem a.Option I involves the loss of some 7, 000 jobs, direct and indirect, in1980-84 compared with 2, 600 in 1980-82 under Option U.   Unemploymentrates in the Shotton travel to work area at 7. 7 per cent are now above theaverage for Great Britain (5.5 per cent) and Wales (7.4 per cent) (detailsin Annex B).    Employment prospects at the only other major employers in the area (Courtaulds and Hawker Siddeley) are not good.    Mersey side,with current unemployment of 12 per cent and worrying prospects, is closeat hand.    The prospects for attracting new projects in the immediate futureare poor, and what can be achieved between 1977 and 1980-81 dependsmainly on the level of activity in the economy nationally.8.        Option HI limits the initial job losses at Shotton to around 1,100though they would come a year or two earlier than under Option I or II.However officials advise mat the 1.8 mtpa development leaves the plantonly semi-modernised and additional investment would be needed m theearly 1980s: this would result in a further loss of jobs, bringing the totalto the 2, 600 foreseen under Option 11*    The capital cost of Option III is verymuch greater than that of Option I or of Option n.   BSC a ultimate capacity for hot rolled coil under Option HX is at least 1.8 mtpa greater than underOption I or Option IX, and 25 per cent more than their estimates of potentialsales in the first half of the 1980s.   Estimates by the Department of industry
suggest that even BSC*s sales estimates may be over-optimistic.    Theadditional capacity in Option III would inevitably delay other development plans of BSC, and the Secretary of State for Scotland is particularly concerned about its impact on the development planned at Hunterston,OTHER POSSIBILITIES9.        The Prime Minister has asked that the possibility of proceeding now with the full expansion at Port Talbot and of postponing a decision onShotton for a year or two should be examined.    The problem is that BSCsdevelopment scheme for Port Talbot specifically requires the closure ofsteelmaking at Shotton since BSC are looking to Shotton to take theadditional output of hot rolled coil from the enlarged Port Talbot.   approval for the full development of Port Talbot will therefore be taken by theShotton interests as implicit approval for the closure of Shotton, whateverwe say in public.    To defer the decision at Shotton will only make it moredifficult.    It is very unlikely that market prospects will improvesufficiently over the next year or two to justify additional capacity.    Evenif they did, the problem of pre-empting developments elsewhere (forexample at Hunter ston) would remain: indeed they would be more highlightedthan now.    If the eventual decision went against Shotton we would have reduced the time available for bringing alternative jobs mere.10,       The Prime Minister also asked about the likelihood of domesticsteelmaking capacity constraints, particularly in the light of delays in thecommissioning of new plant at Port Talbot.    BSC plan to keep the existingiron and steelmaking plant at Shotton in operation until the new capacity at port Talbot is fully operational so that there should be no capacityproblem if commissioning is somewhat delayed.    More generally, asindicated in paragraph 2 above, the combination of existing developments and either Option I or Option II should provide sufficient capacity for BSCto meet all their sales opportunities for strip mill products.    recent experience suggests, however, that supply constraints can arise as much from labour dispute?, technical difficulties and raw material shortages asfrom lack of physical capacity.VIEWS OF El11.       In discussion in El there was a substantial majority in favour ofOption I.    The view of these Ministers was that -a, BSCra productivity record was 25 per cent to 85 per centbelow that of the European industry, and that it would damage theGovernment&apos;s Industrial Strategy to stand in the way of BSCsefforts to raise productivity.b. To hold down productivity in steelmaking would damage thewhole of the economy but especially the tinplate works at Ebbw Vale,Trostre and Velind:ae and the motor industry,3
c. The higher capital costs of Option II would lead either to areduction in other capital expenditure by BSC or to a charge on the contingency Reserve.d. The  20-25 million per annum of higher production costsunder Option II would further increase BSC a financing requirements which at present were  950 million for 1976-77 and  2, 500 million over the following three years.e. The additional job losses compared with Option II almost all fell in the period 1982-84; and. to perpetuate an uncompetitive industry was not the best way to help North Wales and Mersey side.12.      The view of the important minority favouring Option H was that -a. the Government is committed to review the closuresinvolved in bsc&apos;s modernisation programme, balancing economic considerations against social considerations;b. the calculations showing an apparent economic advantagefor Option I assumed that it could be carried through withoutdisruption by industrial disputes.    The relatively poor record of Industrial relations at Port Talbot made this assumptionquestionable;c. the economic base of North Wales was so limited that itcould not stand a contraction at Shotton of the scale of Option I;d. even with the most vigorous action by BSC and the Governmentand with five years for the task it was doubtful whether it would bepossible to make good 7, 000 job losses, almost all male, in theShotton area;e.        it would be necessary to designate Shotton a development area and the real cost of job creation there will fall on the rest ofthe Development Areas,13.      El did not have before them comparable figures for Option III.   Itwas, however, made clear that this course would be unacceptable in Scotland.TIMING14.      The question of timing also needs to be considered.   Sir CharlesVilliers has just been appointed to the Board of BSC but he does not take overas Chairman until September.   Even if the Government endorse bsc&apos;s Btrongpreference for Option I, it might be thought surprising to take this, the majorstrategic decision for BSC for some years, now.   I consider, nonetheless,4
that we should avoid further delay if at all possible.    There would be advantage in consulting Sir Charles informally just in case he has seriousdoubts about bsc&apos;s proposal.    That apart, if we favour Option I we should announce our approval as soon as possible.15.       It would be very difficult to impose a decision in favour of Option non the present Chairman.    There is as yet no xe&amp;aoii to suppose that sir Charles takes a different view and a divergence of opinion on an issueof mis magnitude would be a most inauspicious start to his Chairmanship.If the Government favour Option IE, the best prospect for securing its acceptance might be through informal discussion with Sir Charles; thiswould point to deferring any announcement of our decision.CONCLUSIONS16.       I conclude that the clear balance of advantage lies in the majorexpansion at Port Talbot - Option I - which was supported by the majorityof members of El.    This would -a. result in lower production costs for steel and higherlabour productivity;b. be a positive step both towards achieving the Government&apos;sobjectivs of creating an efficient steel industry and towards theGovernments industrial strategy, since steel is a basic rawmaterial for large sectors of British industry;c. reduce the capital expenditure involved and secure bettervalue for money from it.RECOMMENDATIONS17.       I recommend the following course of action to the Cabinet -a. Decide in favour of Option I, the major expansion at Port Talbot,b. Invite the Secretary of State for Industry and the Secretary ofState for Wales to arrange fox informal consultations with sir Charles Villiers.    If Sir Charles has already considered the options and supports Option I, announce our approval forthwith.If he has not considered the Options, ask him to do so as quickly as possible.    If he favours Option II, we should be willing to reconsider the issue.c. If there has to be delay in announcing our decision on the issue as a whole, give immediate approval for mat part of the modernisationat Port Talbot which is common to all Options and make an immediate announcement of that approval.5
d.    Invite the Secretaries of State for Industry and for wales to make proposals to SI of suitable measures to attract alternativejobs to the Shotton area which might be included in an announcementof approval for Option I.D W HHM Treasury10 May 19766

1.    In addition Option II would require capital expenditure of perhaps 10 million -  15 million at Birkenhead Docks to provide forincreased imports of iron ore.    This would also be necessaryeventually under Option III.2.    Includes  3k million for additional coke ovens at Port Talbot.3.    In Option I the average production cost includes continuingShotton costs and cost of transport of hot rolled coil toShotton for finishing.4.    The agreement reached by BSC with the Unions at Port Talbot on23 March would,  if implemented, reduce total manning at thsworks to some 12,000 from the current 14,000.
