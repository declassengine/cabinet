DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 39 April 1976CHILD BENEFIT: NON-RESIDENT CHILDRENMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social ServicesINTRODUCTION1.      At their meeting on Wednesday 24 March, the Social services committee considered a paper (SS(76) 8) on the need for transitional arrangements in April 1977 to protect the position of some 200, 000families, mainly immigrants to this country, who are currently receivingChild Tax Allowances (CTAs), but not family allowances (FAM), for their children still resident abroad.    Under existing policy, on which the childbenefit (CB) costings have been based, these families would not qualify forCB when their CTAs are withdrawn and would be worse off, by some 12 aweek for each child, If no special action ware taken,    in the debates on theCB Bill last year Ministers said that it was inappropriate to bring non-resident dependents within the CB scheme, but also, in response to opposition pressure undertook to be fair and to look again and see if anythingcould be done.2.      The Committee agreed that there should be a transitional concession in respect of non-resident children for whom a CTA had been given in the tax year 1976-77, and that this should take the form of CTAs at the levelobtaining when the CB scheme came into operation in April 1977.    the families concerned would then Buffer no loss of income in April 1977 having,in effect, a &quot;reserved right&quot; to their existing Child Tax Allowances.3.      I was Invited to report this to Cabinet and to raise with colleaguestwo issues: -a. The public expenditure implications of the concession; and b. the implication for immigration policy, if the concessionwere Jinked to an assurance that the transitional period wouldenable families to bring the non-resident children concerned tothis country.copy NO      gjCABINET
THE COST OF THE CONCESSION4.        It is estimated that, at the rates of child tax allowances for 1976-77the concession could cost  45 million at 1975 Survey prices in the first year.Unless off-setting savings are found or a compensating reduction is made inthe CB rate, this will be an additional claim on the contingency reserve.The cost would decline steadily thereafter, for two reasons.    First, so faras the children concerned came to join their parents in this country, theywould then qualify for child benefit.    Secondly, each year a proportion(at least 6 per cent) of those originally entitled but remaining in the country of origin would cease to be dependent, since the scheme would be a closedone applying only to children for whom the tax allowance was due in 1976-77.Whilst no firm estimate can be made of the rate of decline, the cost wouldcertainly be several million pounds less in each succeeding year after1977-78.5.        I accept that although in form the concession recommended by theSocial Services Committee would be a tax allowance it will add to the net:Exchequer cost of the CB scheme and must therefore be regarded asconsequential upon the CB scheme reducing existing tax allowances.6.        There is no area of my programme from which I could find offsetting savings to match the additional cost of this concession.    The cost of the child Benefit Scheme itself, in so far as it exceeds the combined value of family allowances and the child tax allowances which are replaced will be a claim upon the contingency reserve.    The likely call upon the contfngenc yreserve for this purpose has been illustrated in C(76) 32 as lying between  100 million - 200 million.    The child benefit rate itself is the subject of aseparate submission and I propose therefore that in looking at the totalcalls upon the contingency reserve when deciding upon the cost of implementing the CB scheme we should have regard to the net exchequer cost of the concession for non-resident children.IMMIGRANT CHILDREN COMING TO THIS country .        The Social Services Committee felt a decision on the length of the transitional period for the tax concession should in part depend on thelength of time it would take for families to bring their noa-resident childreninto the United Kingdom and the rate at which they could be admitted.   Itwould be desirable to say the concession was lasting long enough to enableall those who wished to bring their children for whom they had claimed in the tax year 1976-77 to this country to do so before the concession ended.Claims are made at present in respect of some half a million non-residentchildren of parents Jiving in this country.   A dependant child of parentssettled in the United Kingdom is entitled under the Immigration Rules tocome here to join his parents, provided entry clearance is first obtained.By no means all the half a million will be entitled, or if entitled will wishto come, to the United Kingdom for settlement.    For those entitled who dowish to come the limiting factors are the rate and proportion of appUcationsand the rate of grant of entry clearance.-2-
8.        The change to Child Benefit may well encourage parents to bringenetitled, non-resident children to the United Kingdom sooner, or in greater numbers than would otherwise have been the case.    In 1975 some11, 000 children from the Indian sub-Continent, or as United Kingdompassport holders were accepted for settlement on arrival.    The delaybetween initial application and grant of entry clearance is at present nearly2 years in our most heavily loaded parts abroad.    No precise forecast ofthe future can be made but it seems reasonable to assume mat most parentswho wish to bring to the United Kingdom non-resident children in respect ofwkom CTAs are claimed in 1976-77 will have been able to do so by 1982.A transitional period of 2 years from 1977 would therefore be too short toprevent the risk of substantial numbers being placed at a disadvantagebecause entry clearance could not be arranged in time.    However, one of5 years should be just about sufficient.9.        Ministers have told Parliament that any forecasts of futureimmigration are speculative and estimates have not been published.    Injustifying any transitional period we cannot promise that every entitledchild, where application is made by the time CB is introduced, will be ableto come within the period, but we must be able to give a reasonablereassurance for the majority.CONCLUSION10. I invite colleagues to endorse the decisions of the Social services committee and further to agree that;-a. the cost of the concession should be met from the&quot;Contingency Reserve&quot;;b. the transitional period should last 5 years to ensure thatqueues for entry clearance for entitled child dependants canbe cleared before children now qualifying for CTAs cease to be eligible.DEDepartment of Health and Social Security9 April 19763
