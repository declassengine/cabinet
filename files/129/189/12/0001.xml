This document is the property of her britannic majesty *s government cp(76) 12 COPY NO10 May 1976CABINETFIFTH ROUND OF OFFSHORE PETROLEUM PRODUCTIONLICENSING: BRITISH NATIONAL OIL CORPORATIONCONTRIBUTION TO COSTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Energy1. On 15 April 1976 the MinisterialCommlttee on Energy (ENM) agreedthat there should be a further round of offshore petroleum productionlicensing.    The method and timing of the financing of the British NationalOil Corporation^ (BNOC) participation in exploration and developmentarising from the fifth round is however the subject of a difference ofopinion between the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and myself.2.        It is my view that BNOC should contribute its share (51 per cent) tothe costs of exploration and development under fifth round licences, as the costs are incurred.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury, has proposed thatBNOCs contributions should be deferred until such time as they can be paid for out of revenues from successful developments.3.        ENM remitted this issue to a group consisting of the chief secretary, Treasury, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,Lord Kearton and myself, which has not been able to reach an agreed solution.4.        A decision on this issue is urgently needed if the fifth round is notto be delayed.5,        This paper sets out the main arguments.    I have reasoned my caseat Appendix 1.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer^ letter to the PrimeMinister setting out his main views on the question is at Appendix 2.PUBLIC EXPENDITURE6.        Figures of Exchequer caBh flows under the two alternative courses of action are shown in Appendix 3.    In the next five years the additionalcosts to the Exchequer of BNOC contributing from the outset to exploration1
and development costs are estimated to be  22 million and  13 million respectively.   But as can be seen from the appendix early savings are more than offset in the long run by the repayment of deferred contributionswith interest.7,        My view, that BNOC must contribute 51 per cent to costs from the outset is based on the following:-a. The round must be a success.    Deferment of BNOC&apos;a contribution to costs diminish the round&apos;s attractiveness to potentialapplicants and introduces a serious risk of failure.b. Current participation negotiations have been given impetusby companies1 belief that a co-operative stance on participation will ensure favourable treatment in the fifth round allocation.    Thisincentive to negotiate participation is diminished if the round is not seen to be attractive.c. It would be difficult to reconcile the British GasCorporation^ and BNOC(Ex)&apos;s ability (established under previousGovernments) to contribute from the outset, with a BNOC that was unable to contribute from the outset.    BNOC would clearly be at a disadvantage vis-a-vis these corporations and indeed vis-a-visprivate sector companies.    This disadvantage would be compoundedby the fact that BNOC are Inhibited from financing development costsfrom overseas borrowings because this borrowing counts in thePublic Sector Borrowing Requirement, while companies such as british Petroleum have no such inhibition.d. A decision not to back BNOC with money at least to theextent that its private sector competitors enjoy would be verydifficult to justify to the Party at large and to the Trades UnionCongress.e. We have repeatedly given assurances that when in partner-ship BNOC will act commercially.f. If BNOC is not a fully contributing partner from the outsetits ability to influence a range of decisions will be diminished.g. BNOCs contribution and hence the burden on the exchequer could only be deferred till perhaps the mid-1980s and would then have to be paid with interest,I do not believe it to be worth prejudicing the round for a deferment of a fewyears in BNOCs contribution.
8.       Treasury Ministers went to defer for as long as possible BNOCsinvolvement In expenditure under licences, on the basis that everycommercial organisation naturally seeks to defer making payments, ifpossible until there is revenue to cover them; that the BNOC does not haveto buy Its way into these licences; and that if it did there would be additional public expenditure in the early years.   Treasury Ministers also argue thatwith interest payable on any deferred contribution the success of the roundwill not be put at risk; but that if nonetheless it was considered thatdeferred terms might make the round less attractive, then other terms couldbe eased to compensate for this.   I have looked at this last suggestion andam satisfied that adjustments to the financial terms (eg royalty) would haveminimal compensatory effect due to their relative cheapness, and the point that they are expansible for tax purposes.conclusion.       In view of the importance that we attach to a successful fifth round,I invite my colleagues to agree that BNOC should pay its share of allexploration and development costs under fifth round licences, as and whenthose expenses are incurred.10.      If however agreement cannot be reached on this basis, then in theinterests of settling the issue as soon as possible, to avoid dele ring the round I am prepared to ptx forward the following as a compromise:-BNOC will as the standard pattern meet its share of explorationcosts as they arise leaving open for decision case by case whetherBNOC should pay its share of development coats as tbey arise, ordefer them to be met out of revenue with an appropriate rate ofinterest.AWBDepartment of Energy10 May 19763CJQN4FHMNTM0.
TH3 CA;53 FOR 1 PAT A3 YOU GO&apos;  30UTJBObjectivesIn order &quot;to achieve success in the round it is my view that B2J0C must contribute 51^ to costs from the outset.BNOC must begin to build up its existing capability if it is beginning will enable it to gain experience and influencedecisions.(a) The attraction of the package is essential tosuccess of the rotmd.     We cannot risk a failure.     To add the further burden ofdeferred costs to what is already a toughpackage will, in the view of our consultants,act as a substantial disincentive toapplication.     Failure of the round would be politically embarrassing, would lose confidence in the tTK Shelf and income from future finds,Employment in oil related industries would be jeopardised.     For comparison purposes it isworth mentioning that the Irish and Greenlandprovisions are less onerous than   what we propose,   This is mainly because neither country has a special oil tax.(b) The imminence of the round has added impetusto comp-nies&apos; willingness to negotiateparticipation.    This is because they expect.   the round to be attractive.     If terms are madeless attractive by insisting on BlfOC beingcarried through, the development stage this leverfor getti^.7; companies to the negotiating tablewill become very much less effective.to fulfil its intended role.Full partnership from the2.My main arguments   are as follows
Contribution from the start by BNOCwould underline the Government&apos;s intention that J3II0C should be able to behavecommercially (a point on which many HMO       &apos;assurances have been given).We are seeking full oil company Btatus forBNOC with aocess from the start to information and deoision taking.     Deferred payment couldwell involve at worst partial surrender of voting rights and diminished status at thebest. fAs a full partner BNOC will be better able to influence investment policies to the advantageof the UK oil related industries,BHOC would also have more influence over the pace of exploration and thus could aid the ^achievement of desired depletion policies.The burden, on the Exchequer of BHOC contributingfrom the start 23 recognised, but the coats are      irelatively modest.     BlIOCs initial outlay onexploration is estimated to be  50m between 1977and 1983, -    If this were carried by privatepartners the real saving could be smaller as (companies are often able to expense such costs for tax purposes, 1The additional net burden on the Exchequer by the pay as you go route of development costs mightapproximate to  100m a year in 1982-1984,  150-200m nxoaa).     Deferring contribution would resultin the burden on the iixchequer being deferred to1986-1989i together with any interest th-t might beagreed on the contribution (Xl75m at 1$),   It inquestionable whether it is worth prejudicing the round for a deferment^ of Exchequer burdenstarting ifi^Y^j^ryaears time.
BGC &amp; BNOC(Ex) contribute to costs as they arise,   BNOC would be seen as a half-heatedparticipant compared with these corporationsif it was not able to contribute.   BNOC wouldalso he at a disadvantage in comparison withthese corporations and with the private sector.If BNOC were to follow the practice of majorcompanies such as BP in borrowing abroad to finance its developments then the Exchequercosts would be eliminated.   While X understand thatBNOCs foreign borrowing would count as part ofthe public sector borrowing requirement, thisshould not be an inhibiting factor if BNOC are tobe allowed to compete on level terms with theprivate sector.\
&apos;.. Treasury Chambers, Parliament Street, SW1P 3AGO1-90O 1204-PRIME MINISTER .  -Fifth Round North Sea Licenses -Government Contribution to Capital CostsI have seen EN(76)9, in which the Secretary of State for Energyreports&apos; a disagreement with the Treasury about one aspect of theproposed financial terms for fifth round licenses, and I should liketo make my position clear in advance of the EN meeting on Monday12th April.2.     It may help if I set out my position afresh.   We all agree thatBNOC- should participate in future fifth*rbund licenses.   Lord.KeaKton would like his Corporation to be an active partner from the start, contributing to exploration and development expenditure,having access to information and a pact to play in decision making.I &quot;see.no case for a Government contribution to exploration, althoughthe sums Involved are not particularly large.   I believe we can secure the access to information and the decision making powers thatwe need through the ordinary licensing process during the explorationphase, and through participation at the development stage.Participation will also give us half the oil.   Provided BNOC has a&apos;carried interest&apos; option to join in once a field is declaredcommercial, I think the public interest is safeguarded.3,     The question then is whether it should contribute to development costs as they arise.   My suggestion is that there should be noautomatic obligation to contribute.   Each case should be negotiatedindividually.   There should be a strong presumption that HMG will not put up cash, but that its share of the capital costs should be/ contributed retroactively out
contributed retrospectively out of revenue.   This means that thecompanies, in exchange for the right to exploit mineral resources onthe Continental Shelf, would be required to finance HMG&apos;s share ofthe investment until any fields it discovered produced sufficientrevenue to pay back the public share of the costs out of the publicshare of revenue.   The company would be entitled to interest on the repayment.of the capital contribution which it made on behalf of theBNOC.   We would have to decide whether, if the field were abandonedbefore the full development costs were recouped, BNOC would havenevertheless to contribute its share of costs to date..4. &quot; This seems to me the correct commercial approach to thenegotiations.   It would be wrong for the Government, in conceding a valuable franchise to an oil company, to be required itself to finance its own share of the capital costs of developing any oil,fields discovered.    If, unexpectedly, any 1Icensee.finds&apos; himselffinable to raise the necessary capital, then BNOC has the power tocontribute.   But I believe that the whole license package.should be constructed on the assumption that, in the normal case, there willbe no public capital contribution.r 1 .5..j    It 1s important to maintain this approach, not only forstrictly commercial reasons, but because of the prospective calls on public expenditure andNthe public sector borrowing requirement ifthe Government were required to finance 50 per cent of futured development costs.   It is no answer to say that this would beprofitable investment;   the difficulty lies in raising the necessary.finance during the development stage.   Our projections of availablereal resources and of public expenditure and receipts already allow for a Government take from any new fields which may be discovered,but not for any BNOC capital contribution.   As Ministers know, the/ public expenditure situation- 2 -CQNfIDENTIAL
public expenditure situation projected on those assumptions isalready difficult enough.   To require dire;t BNOC investment infield development would reduce, pro tanto the amounts available for -other public expenditure programmes.6.     I do not see why these terms need necessarily have adisincentive effect.   In most cases, the prospective licensees willbe borrowing to finance field development, rather than using theirown internally-generated cash resources.   Some of the borrowingwill be (indirectly) on the strength of the BNOC involvement in thefield (which has the effect of ensuring that resources will always be available to ensure its development provided it remains viable).So. the lenders&apos; security should be improved and the oil companies1problems in raising finance eased.   The forecasts of availablefinance already assume that the oil companies will be able to raiseTOO per cent of the capital needed.7^ -In any case, if the package as a whole seems unattractive onthese terms (which seems unlikely, given the success of the Irishand Norwegian governments in negotiating equally tough arrangements)the solution might be to adjust some other element of the package -the license fee, the rental, resale of some of the BNOC oil, theroyalty rate, etc., rather than to compromise on the essentialprinciple of a Government capital contribution.   Such concessionswould affect future &quot;revenues, extending over the life of the field,and would be more acceptable than a Government capital contribution in the early years of the field when the constraints on public expenditure will be tightest.8.     The Secretary of State has argued that, if my terms were included in the license, the whole round might become a flop.   I do/ not believe this
not believe this would happen, for the reasons given above. But 1fthis is considered a real danger, there aj-s, two alternatives which,we should consider. -..9.    The first is that we should abandon altogether the idea of a1976 licensing round.   The advice of officials who have studieddepletion policy (EH(76)4) is that we should, on balance, go ratherslower with new licenses.   Admittedly, we have already announced theIntention to have a fifth round this year.   But we could defend achange of policy by referring to the increasing importance ofconservation and of a fairly strict depletion policy.10.   Alternatively, if this course were thought too damaging to theconfidence of the offshore supplies industry, I suggest that wesimply drop the idea of a fround&apos; of licenses.   Instead, we couldindicate in general terms our intention to issue new licenses(-without saying how many) and begin separate negotiations with themain potential licensees.   We could say that it was open to anycompany to make a bid for a particular block within the designatedarea.   This course would leave us much freer to negotiate individualterms case by case, and if the number of applicants were smaller than we hoped, we would be able to adjust the terms continuously tomaintain the necessary flow of new exploration.   But 1n doing so, weshould avoid any risk of a &apos;flop&apos; with the consequent damage to theoffshore industry and to the credibility of the Governments north sea Policy.(D. W. H.)^ April, 1976
