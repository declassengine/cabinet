DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(76) 20COPY NO      g \17 May 1976CABINETPROGRAMME ANALYSIS AND REVIEW AND LONGER-TERMPUBLIC EXPENDITURE SAVINGSMemorandum by the Central Policy Review staff. Under the system of Programme Analysis and Review (PAR)Ministers agree each year a programme of policy reviews.    These reviewsare intended to look critically at specific areas of policy, to see whether thepolicy objectives are right, to examine options for changing the balance ofpolicy to meet changing circumstances, to make existing programmes morecost-effective, and to identify possibilities for reducing expenditure in ares which have become of lower priority.2.        The PAR system is not designed simply, or indeed primarily, to save money.    It is designed to keep policy objectives under review, and toensure that objectives are effectively implemented.3.        But the basic concept of looking critically at specific areas of policy s clearly relevant when longer-term public expenditure savings are being discussed.    It was therefore felt that the Cabinet&apos;s wish to examine ways ofidentifying long-term public expenditure savings (CC(75) 35th Conclusions,Minute 2) was best looked at in parallel with the PAR programme.4. The Annexes to the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper set out 3 categories ofpolicy review.5.        Annex I sets out the topics which have been agreed interdepartmentallyfor analysis under the PAR programme.    Before approving the proposals in annex 1 Ministers should consider whether it contains subjects to which they attach importance from a political point of view, and whether they wish tosuggest changes in the timing proposed for the reviews.6.        Annex II lists policy reviews which are now being carried on orproposed, outside the PAR programme.    Potentially, these reviews arejust as important in terms of identifying longer-term public expendituresavings as the proposed PAR studies.    In looking at Annex II, ministers should therefore consider which of these policy reviews they regard as themost promising and important as sources of longer-term savings.    TheCabinet may wish to invite the Departmental Ministers concerned to ensurethat, wherever possible, the reviews listed in Annex II should explicitlyconsider possibilities for longer-term expenditure savings.
7.        Annex ZTJ sets out a further list of possible subjects for review.These have been proposed by the Central Departments, but the Departmentsconcerned are reluctant to see them included in the PAR programme.Ministers will need to considert-a. whether they want any or all of the subjects listed in annex III to be examined; and, if so, whether under the PARprogramme or by some other means;b. whether there are subjects which are not listed in any ofthe Annexes which they would like to see examined as potentialsources of longer-term savings.    Bearing in mind that largesavings can only be secured by radical changes in policy, itwould be extremely useful if Ministers could themselves indicateareas where they were prepared politically to consider radical changes in policy in order to secure longer-term public expenditure savings.    At the same time, there is no point inembarking on reviews for their own sake.    Subjects which fromthe outset appear likely to produce politically unacceptableresults are better ruled out now.8.        Ministers will need to consider the timing of the proposed reviews.Clearly, they cannot all be done immediately;  and none of them is likely toproduce results which will affect the 1976 Public Expenditure Survey.    Butit will be important to ensure that a fair number of them are actuallycompleted and considered by Ministers in time for the results to be incorporated in next year&apos;s public expenditure discussions.9.        Looking for long-term savings is not a once-for-a 11 exercise.    It is something which Ministers need to consider at regular intervals.    An annualstocktaking at the same time as Ministers consider the annual PARprogramme, seems the most straightforward way to do this.10.       The reviews set out in the Annexes to the Chief Secretary&apos;a paptsrwill involve a fairly substantial block of work for Departments over thenext three years.    The Central Policy Review Staff considers it essentialthat the longer-term work of policy analysis and review should continue? and indeed be given priority, even when Departments are under pressure to restrict their activities and save manpower.    An adequate system for reviewing policy is all the more necessary when resources are very tig&amp;t,and when a radical appraisal of Departmental activities is going on.CONCLUSIONS11.       Ministers are therefore asked:-i.       To endorse the proposed PAR programme at Annex I of theChief Secretary&apos;8 paper,2
ii.       To take note of the policy reviews listed at Annex II, anda. indicate those to which they attach priority as potentialsources of long-term public expenditure saving;b. invite the Departmental Ministers concerned toensure that these reviews consider explicitly the scope for savings in the long term.iii. To decide which of the subjects listed in Annex III they wish to see reviewed.iv. To indicate areas of policy not included in the Annexes tothe Chief Secretary-s paper which they would like to seeexamined as sources of potential long-term savings.v. To indicate which reviews (whether in the PAR programmeor outside it) they consider most urgent, and which they wouldlike to be completed in time for the results to be incorporated in next year&apos;s Public Expenditure Survey.vi.       To agree that the subject of potential long-term savingsshould be looked at annually, in conjunction with the annual review of the PAR programme.Cabinet Office17 May 19763
