DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government copy NO    gjCABINETPOSSIBLE PHASING IN OF CHILD BENEFIT IN 1977Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Prices and consumer Protection and Paymaster General and theSecretary of State for Social services.        We have discussed with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, the schemesfor phasing in child benefit in 1977 set out in paragraph 21 of the note by officials attached to CP(76) 18.    We are all agreed that, although the firstoption in the table would be the simplest, it is too expensive and should be ruled out of further consideration.2.        The Chief Secretary reserves his position on whether the other twooptions are worth exploring.    We consider that they are because i.       there are substantial administrative implications inpostponing the scheme (see Annex 1 of the note by officials);and because of the series of commitments made by successiveMinisters, and the political problems inherent in a decision not to fulfil a major Manifesto commitment (see Annex 3 of the note by officials);ii.       we accept that the introduction of either of theee two schemes will bring criticism from the Opposition, from some of our own supporters and from the poverty lobby: but the general public will well understand that Government policy must recognise the constraints of public expenditure and of incomes policy.We will gain respect for introducing the CB scheme in a modestform rather than reneging on a major commitment entered intoat the last election and enshrined in subsequent legislation.3.        Both schemes would need more manpower than the origio&amp;l ChildBenefit scheme (see Annex 2 of the officials&apos; paper): an increase in staff would be needed both by Inland Revenue and by the Department ofHealth and Social Security.CP(76) 2117 May 19761
4.        We recommend that the Cabinet should choose as between the twocheaper options set out in paragraph 21.    The first has the following advantages: -a. It minimises the fall in take-home pay.b. Its effect on net family income is presentationally simpler.c. It implies only one premium for single parent families.The second has the following advantages:-d. It has the presentational advantage that first childrendo not get less,e. It gives more help to those below the tax threshold.f. It is cheaper.5,        We invite our colleagues to choose between the second and thethird option and to decide whether the cost of either option should bereduced by avoiding special treatment for non-resident children as inparagraph 26 of the paper by officials.S WD EDepartment of Prices and Consumer Protection17 May 1976
