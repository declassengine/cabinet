DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(?6) 22COPY NO20 May 1976 g jCABINETDEVOLUTION TO SCOTLAND AND WALES:PROPOSED PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENTNote by the Lord President of the council.        We are preparing the Devolution Bill for introduction at the start ofthe next parliamentary Session.    This entails developing in detail theschemes set out in the White Paper of November 1975 (Cmnd 6348),considering possible changes to them in the light of the process of publiccomment which we invited, and settling questions which the White Paperleft open.2.        To maintain the public momentum of our policy and to keep thepolitical initiative, we need to make a very early statement - before the spring Holiday if at all possible - on our main decisions so far.   the ministerial Committee on Devolution Strategy (DVY) has agreed on thedesirability of this, and of including in the statement decisions notonly on the programme of action but also on some substantial elements of the schemes.3.        I attach at Annex the draft of a Parliamentary statement which Ithink it important to make, if Cabinet agrees, on Tuesday 25 May.Since time is short, I am circulating it in advance of DVY consideration.An oral report on that consideration will be made to the Cabinet.4.        The first part of the statement (paragraphs 2-5) sets out decisions which DVY has already considered on the programme of action - one combinedBill for both countries, no referendum, no &quot;draft&quot; Bill this Session.   Allthese decisions flow from the central and vital objective of carrying ourdevolution schemes into law next Session.5.        The second part of the statement (paragraphs 7-15) sets out decisionsproposed on three areas of substance - the Scottish and Welsh DevelopmentAgencies; the universities; and the constitutional roles of the Secretaries ofState.   These are matters which have attracted great interest, especially inScotland, and I would expect decisions in the sense of the text at Annex to bevery well received, particularly by our supporters.6.       Subject to any points raised by DVY considerations, I invite theCabinet to approve the statement at Annex.M FPrivy Council Office20 May 1976
DRAFT  PARLIAMENTARY  statement i wish to tell the House of decisions the Government haforward our policy on devolution to Scotland and Wales.2. We are determined to introduce legislation affectirWales at the beginning of the next session, and to ask 1in that session. The announcement I made to the HouS&apos;starting to-incur commitments on accommodation for ta sign of our resolve.3. As my predecessor promised, we have consideredhaving separate Bills for Scotland and Wales. We havisingle combined Bill. Separate Bills would demand tO&apos;time for both to pass in a single session.4. We have considered also holding a referendum onhave been exceptionally wide opportunities, before ancElection, for public discussion of our proposals and wdecided firmly against any further special test of opin:5.    We have decided not to publish a &quot;draft&quot; Bill in thsince this would divert effort from the preparation of session.6. I turn now to the substance of our devolution propinform the House of certain decisions we have reacheson our White Paper, about the Development Agencies;the constitutional roles of the Secretaries of State.
7.    We have decided that responsibility for all operations of the scottish and Welsh Development Agencies, and for all appointments to them, shouldbe transferred to the devolved administrations.   This includes responsibilityfor financing the Agencies from the resources controlled by the devolvedadministrations.   To ensure that there can be no unfair competition withother parts of the United Kingdom the industrial investment operations of the agencies will be subject to guidelines laid down by the Government from timeto time.   With this sole qualification, they will be wholly the responsibility ofthe devolved administrations.   They will also retain their existing powers toact on behalf of the Secretary of State in selective industrial assistance cases.8.    We have weighed the divergent views on whether responsibility for the universities in Scotland and Wales should be devolved.   We have decided tomaintain the line taken in the White Paper, and the Bill therefore will not provide for the devolution of the universities.9.    We recognise however that the new administrations, with their wideresponsibilities in the field of education, must be closely interested in thework of the universities.   The University Grants Committee fully shares thisrecognition.   Accordingly, the Government will take account of the views ofthe new administrations in making all appointments to the Committee;  we willrevise the Committee^ terms of reference to underline the continuing need totake thorough account of the distinctive Scottish and Welsh education systemsoutside the university sector;  the Committee itself will invite advisers fromthe administrations to sit with it at all levels of business, and particularly in special new sub-committees which it proposes to set up for Scotland andWales;  and it will at all times be ready to provide data, advice and evidence
to the new administrations.   These proposals willand flexible liaison in the proper planning of the uieducational institutions of each country and of the10. I turn next to the constitutional roles of the Separticularly in Scotland. In the light of the -Parliament and elsewhere we have made the  11. Firstly, while our consideration of the detaileexamination of the vires of Scottish Assembly prircomplete, we have decided that the Secretary of Stshould not have the power to reject Assembly Billsis doubt about the vires of Assembly Bills, the finJudicial Committee of the Privy Council.12.   Secondly, the Secretary of State will play no pthe Scottish Executive.   Formal appointment will tact on      the recommendation of the AssemblyExecutive and on that of the Chief Executive in theMembers.   Assistants to the Executive will be appExecutive.13. Thirdly, the Secretary of State will have no rcsize of the Scottish Executive or the pay of its Merbe left to the Assembly, as will comparable ones i14, Y/s have not completed our detailed consideralpowers other than Parliaments inherent power tomake a major change in this field.   Any general re
Vtheir precise form and mechanisms, will be explicitly limited tosituations where their use is necessary to prevent unacceptable repercussionsa:jn matters for which the United Kingdom Government will remain responsible.bWe have never envisaged using such powers simply because we might politically dislike what was being done, and the change we are making puts this beyondioubt.   I re-affirm also that whatever the form of any genera), powers theywill, as the White Paper made clear, be subject to the direct and specificObontrol of Parliament, and not available simply at the whim of the Government.A5.   The Secretaries of State for Scotland and for Wales will remain, intftccordance with the Governments commitments, members of the Cabinet.t^ut these decisions make it plain that there is no possibility, however far-fetched, of their being autocratic supervisors of the devolved administrations,a16.   These are the decisions we have taken so far.   I shall make a report to8die House on further decisions before the summer recess.UL7.   The Government have listened carefully to the national debate on devolution,rand we have improved our schemes in the light of it.   We now move forward,pis we promised, from the phase of discussion to the phase of legislation and&quot;ulfilment.   This is what Scotland and Wales hdd a right to expect.   The good9aith of the United Kingdom Parliament can strengthen and enhance the Union.
