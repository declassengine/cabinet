THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S government cp(76) 25 COPY NO    gl7 June 1976CABINETDIRECT ELECTIONS TO THE EUR.european ASSEMBLYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs.        At its meeting on 26 March Cabinet had before it a memorandum(C(76) 44) by the then Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary setting out thecurrent state of the negotiations in the Community.    Cabinet agreed to the setting up of a Select Committee on Direct Elections.    It further agreedthat in continuing negotiation at Community level our representatives should have sufficient freedom for manoeuvre to avoid attracting odium,whilst making it clear that there would need to be adequate representation for the United Kingdom and its constituent parts, and that no final decisions could be taken until the report of the Select Committee had been consideredby Parliament.2.        During the debate on direct elections on 29 and 30 March, the PrimeMinister (then Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary) in his opening speech made the offer of setting up a Select Committee to consider thequestion of direct elections.    This was generally welcomed in all quarters of the House, although the actual setting up of the Committee wasunfortunately delayed until 17 May by a small group of Members whopersisted in trying to amend the Motion (despite considerable efforts by theGovernment to meet their point of view).    The Committee have since mettwice and will have further meetings mis week at which they will decide whether they are able to produce an interim report on the specific questionsof numbers and distribution of seats, the issue on which negotiations inthe Community are being most actively pursued,3.        The European Council of 1-2 April, while agreeing on certain minorquestions in particular the electoral period (from a Thursday to thefollowing Sunday inclusive) and the counting of the vote (to begin after allCommunity polls were closed), made no progress on the central questionof numbers.    This was largely because of a surprise Initiative by president Giscard who, for his own internal political reasons, proposedthat for the first elections the present number and distribution of seats of1
the Assembly should be retained.    This proposal has very little attractionfor us since it would mean a continuance of the heavy over-representationcf the smaller Member States and would be less advantageous from thepoint of view of the representation of Scotland, Wales and Northern Irelandthan the Assembly1 s own original proposal.    But the proposal gained agood deal of momentum as a possible way of breaking the deadlock, andwe came under some pressure after the European Council to settle onthat basis.    We resisted this pressure and have been successfulrecently in directing attention to other proposals which come nearer to meeting our requirements.    We have also had some success in bringinghome to the rest of the Nine the seriousness of our political need toensure adequate representation for Scotland and Wales.4.        Of the proposals now under active consideration, a Belgiancompromise proposal tabled after the European Council and envisagingan Assembly of 401 (of which 79 seats would go to the United Kingdom) isthe best from our point of view.   No other proposal gives us as manyseats or so favourable a comparison with the smaller Member States.The Luxembourg Presidency have also put forward a compromise basedon doubling the numbers in the existing Assembly with some adjustments.It would produce an Assembly of 366 (with 72 seats for the United Kingdom).No United Kingdom proposal has been put forward but in order to illustrateHer Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs position (as set out in paragraphs 18-19 ofthe Green Paper Cmnd 6399) United Kingdom representatives circulatedbefore the European Council a set of illustrative tables showing theresults of combining an initial allocation cf 3, 4 or 5 seats per member state with a pattern of seats distributed strictly in accordance withpopulation,   A solution based on these tables would be rather morefavourable to us than the Belgian proposal and, perhaps for this reason,they have not aroused much interest in the Community.5.        There is now a good deal of pressure in the Community to reach asettlement on the question of numbers by mid-June, ie before the Italianelections.    Foreign Ministers are to have another round of negotiationon 12 June.    It is not yet possible to say whether a consensus can emergein that time scale.    Much will depend on the French showing some signsof flexibility.    So far there has been no indication of this, butChancellor Schmidt, following a message from the Prime Minister and discussions with Herr Genscher in London, has agreed to bring somedirect influence to bear on President Giecard.    Jt is therefore not impossible that the French will make an early move, though I think itrather unlikely.    If not, the Prime Minister will have the opportunity of ascertaining what degree of flexibility exists on the French side when hesees President Giscard during the State Visit from 22 to 25 June.   Itseems most likely that any real movement in the French position will beleft until the European Council meeting on 12-13 July.    This still remains the target date for reaching agreement in the Community on direct electionsas a whole.2
6.        It will be vital in the run-up to the European Council to ensurethat the Select Committee feel that they are in close touch with thenegotiations and are not presented with a fait accompli,    Mr Hatter sley,as a member of the Committee, will keep them as fully briefed aspossible and will encourage them to report at least on the size anddistribution of seats in the Assembly by mid-June, and if possible in timefor the meeting on 12 June, if their work is sufficiently advanced.    I would avoid coming to a decision in the Community at this meeting unless theCommittee have reported and their views are consistent with theconsensus mat seems to be emerging.    If such a situation should developoffering a reasonably satisfactory solution from the United Kingdom pointof view, it would seem right to agree ad referendum to Cabinet and subjectto the views of Parliament as a whole,CONCLUSIONS7.        I invite the Cabinet to agree that the Prime Minister and I shouldcontinue to negotiate along the lines set out in the Green Paper.    Inparticular we should look for a solution to the problem of the number anddistribution of seats which would avoid an unreasonable discrepancybetween the ratio of seats to electors in the smaller Member States and inthe larger ones and which would be defensible to opinion in the different parts of the United Kingdom.    We should naturally take the fullest accountof any recommendations or reports produced in this period by the SelectCommittee, and would not reach any settlement in the Community at theForeign Ministers&apos; meeting on 12 June unless the Committee had alreadyreported in a way that gave the Government the necessary negotiatingflexibility.A foreign and Commonwealth office June 19763
