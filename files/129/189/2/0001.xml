K DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 2 COPY NO       818 April 1976CABINETCHILD BENEFITMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services . The time ha a now come to fix the rate for our long-postponed childbenefit scheme.   Although the scheme does not start until April 1977 the publicity campaign and take on of claims begins this August, and for operational reasons we have to decide the rate now.2.        The memorandum by officials sets out the details of the various possible rates.    They range from  2.45, with a premium to ensure that large and one-parent families do not actually lose, to  2. 70*3.        There are compelling reasons for fixing as good a rate as we can afford, and certainly setting it above the level which merely makes no-oneworse off.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer has rightly pledged theGovernment as one of its two main contributions to the social contract toprovide &quot;help for those who are least able to withstand the impact of inflation - above all pensioners and families with young children&quot; (HansardTuesday 12 November 1974 Vol 881 col 272).   Families with children havebeen getting substantially less support than the Tories provided in 1970,1971 and 1972 and less than we provided in our years in office in the ^Oa.Even the increase we are making in Child Tax Allowances this year doeslittle more than match the 1974 level of support which is still below theConservative level of 1971 and this improvement will be worth much less bythe time the new scheme starts next April.    H we continue to let childsupport be eroded by inflation the whole scheme will be condemned as atrick to give children less, not more.   In addition we cannot ignore thefact that we are phasing out food subsidies: even the Tories, when they didthis in the &apos;50s, gave compensation by a substantial increase in family allowances.    At the same time school meal charges are to go up by 5p this autumn and another 5p next year adding 5Op a week during term for eachschoolchild not entitled to free meals.    Nor can we comfortably defendourselves against the charge of failing to make our pledged contribution tothe social contract by arguing that families with young children should liaveI
recourse tb the humiliation of applying for the means-tested family income Supplement&quot; (to quote our 1973 programme).    This form ofselectivity is intolerable to our supporters, while selecting families becausethey have children is not.4.        To restore a three-child family to the level of support it had underthe Tories in 1971 would require a rate of  2. 90.    I recognise reluctantlythat we cannot afford to match the Tory level of support.    But we ought tosecure a rate which would give a reasonable margin against inflation for allfamilies.    This suggests a rate of  2.85.    If this cannot be afforded - andI recognise the concurrent claim on the contingency reserve of the concession for non-resident children - then in my judgment the minimum rate we could defend would be  2.70.    This would give a noticeable cashimprovement to all families; it would give the three-child family a cashimprovement of 11 per cent over the level of child support provided thisApril so as roughly to compensate for the projected increase of the retail price Index (though with hardly any margin for any increases above this level); and it would restore nearly all families to at least the real level of support they had in 1974, between the two elections at which we pledgedourselves to reform the system of family support.5.        The lower rates of child benefit in the table require a specialpremium for large and one-parent families so that they do not lose.   Anyrale involving such a premium is open to a number of serious objections.First, it would presentationally make us a laughing stock.   A largeproportion of the families in the premium classes - at least a third andprobably a good deal more - would not gain because they were on social security or other means-tested benefits; and we could not plead, as we canwith Child Interim Benefit, that it was a makeshift arrangement ahead of themain scheme.   And the premium classes do not correlate with poorfamilies as a whole: among poor and hard-pressed working families thereare considerably more small two-parent families than large and one-parent families put together.    Moreover it is certain that we would be driven tohaving separate payment systems in at least some one-parent family cases,probably in all of them.    Second, to operate such a device would need atleast 150 extra manpower, perhaps twice as many, at a time when I amdesperately searching for ways of reducing manpower as a result of ourPublic Expenditure Survey decisions.   And it would severely complicatelocal office procedures, when again to save manpower I am desperatelyseeking simplification.    Third, if the scheme Is to start, contrary to what we said during the passage of the BUI, with two variants on top of the basic rate, we shaU at least severely prejudice the options for later developments which we then held out to the House.   In particular age relation, which is widely expected In due course, would be operationally extremely difficultwith two other variants, quite apart from being just too complicated for ordinary public understanding.2
6.        In the light of the foregoing I invite colleagues to agree that the starting rate of child benefit should be  2. 70,    The cost would be a charge against the contingency reserve of  141 million - well within the limitsillustrated as a possible claim in fee list circulated in C(76) 32,D EDepartment of Health and Social Security8 April 19763
