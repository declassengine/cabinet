DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S government cp(76)7 COPY NO      813 May 1976CABINETCHILD BENEFIT RATEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services. I have reconsidered the proposals in CP(76) 2 in the light of mycolleagues&apos; clear wish to give priority to a transitional tax concession fojrimmigrants with overseas children, and of competing claims on the contingency Reserve (CP(76) 6) against a background of the unavoidableconstraints on public expenditure.2.        We cannot brush aside the importance of family support either inthe social or the economic context.   I remain convinced that basic ratesof either  2.45 or  2.50 are not ones which we could defend, on thefollowing ground fl,1. Because of the forecast rate of inflation in the coming yearsuch rateB for a large proportion of families would be worth lesswhen introduced in April 1977 than the current value of family allowances and Child Tax Allowances (CTAa).    The  2.50 plus 50ppremium rate would, on present forecasts of the Retail Price Index,mean that almost all two-parent families with more than one child(including, even taking account of the premium, most large familieswhere there is often serious hardship) would be worse off In real terms than they are now.   Just to maintain the present value we need fee following rates;No of children in family Rate needed*2  2.523  2.634  2.69These rates are well below the value of Tory family support from 1971 to1973, and they allow no margin whatever for further erosion by inflationeither before or after April 1977.* These figures are based on the present Public Expenditure Surveyassumption of an 8 per cent rise in prices between 1976-77 and 1977-78.Between April 1976 and April 1977 the rise may well be higher and higher rates would be needed to maintain the real value on a point to pointcomparison. confidential
2.        The  2.45 and  2.50 rates need premiums for one-parent families and for large families to avoid serious losses even in cash terms (let alone in real terms).   As CP(76) Z indicated thesepremiums are open to serious objections.    To recapitulate briefly:a. Many of those getting premiums would gain nothingfrom them: half the one-parent families are on supplementary benefit and would simply have that benefit reduced, whilst forall the rest we would be incurring the cost and odium of acohabitation rule in respect of a trifling benefit.    Other poorfamilies, who are not in the premium classes would get lass and in effect be subsidising the premium classes.b. They prejudice the later introduction of age relatedchild benefits which are not only the cheapest way of abolishing the residual CTAs, with substantial staff savings,but the development most widely expected, not least  by ourown supporters,c. They make nonsense of any attempt to save manpower.I cannot guarantee that my own staff would operate thescheme with premiums, in view of the intense opposition which premiums, needing up to 300 extra staff, and bringingnew complications, would provoke when drastic manpowercuts are being forced on them.3,        To spend less in real terms in 1977 on many families when akey reform of family support is introduced, would surely beregarded as a confidence trick by our own supporters as well asthe Opposition, especially with the inevitable sharp fall in take homepay (see Annex 1)*3.        I have considered whether the real value of the  2.45 and  2.50rates makes them so unattractive as to raise the question whether the scheme should be postponed if we were driven to such rates.    But there areoverwhelming obstacles in practice:1. We have had to print order books with notes referring to thenew and different entitlement conditions child benefit would entail.It is too late to reprint and we would have to pay the old family allowance rate on the new books.2.        postponement to 1978 would mean that the fall in take homepay coincided with the start of the higher contributions to the newpension scheme,3.        We would face serious accusations of bad faith at yet anotherpostponement of the scheme.   After the assurances we have givenabout the start of the scheme, postponement would raise doubts as towhether we had any serious intention of pursuing it; and a two-yearpostponement in particular would call in question the Government1 agood faith just when we might be facing another election.2
4.        I ask colleagues to accept that a rate requiring premiums forone-parent and large families is, for the reasons I have given, not a viableproposition.   In terms of maintaining the real value of family support, 2.70 remains the lowest defensible rate, but in the very serious public expenditure situation in which we find ourselves I recognise that this figure is not attainable,     2. 65 is the lowest rounded flat rate which will ensure mat no family is worse off in cash terms.    This rate would alsoensure that the great majority of families were at least slightly better offin real terms.    If forced back to  Z, 60 we could no longer say that nofamily was worse off even in cash terms.    There would be a small cashloss (4p a child) for some one-parent families with Child Interim Benefit(CHIB).    When Cabinet agreed to CHIB in January 1975 they recognisedthat some families might lose and agreed that this should not be used asan argument for a higher child benefit rate.    We would have to justifythe loss publicly on the grounds that these families have had anun coven anted bonus for the past year and would in April 1977 be on a levelwith all other families, but nevertheless it would be bound to be stronglyexploited by the pressure groups.    The  2. 60 rate would mean no realimprovement for the three child or larger family on the Treasury forecast of inflation.5.        The cost of the  2.65 rate would be  116 million which with the 45 million for overseas children amounts to  161 million as against thehigher of the two figures for the Child Benefit Scheme as whole of 186 million, the coat of my previous recommendation, in CP(76) 6.The cost of the  2.60 rate is  90.5 million, making  135,5 million withthe overseas children,6.        I deal in Annex II with the effect of possible rates on eligibility formeans tested benefits.D EDepartment of Health and Social Security3 May 19763
