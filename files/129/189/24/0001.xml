DEVELOPMENTS IN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIESNOVEMBER 1975-APRIL 1976Section I.  Utrod action1. This is a report in the series presented to Parliament by the Govem-ment in accordance with the recommendation of the Select Committee on european Community Secondary Legislation in its second report of the1972-73 Session. The report published in November 1975* covered theperiod up to 31 October 1975. This report records developments duringthe period to 30 April 1976. The aim is to describe major decisions reached by the European Communities during this period and to refer to major workin progress.Sectkm IL Political Co-operation2. The nine countries of the Community have continued to co-ordinatetheir position and policies on foreign policy matters. Useful consultatioahas taken place between the Nine on the follow-up to the Conference as security and Co-operation in Europe and co-operation has continued on a close and daily basis at the United Nations. The Nine have continued tokeep in touch with the parties involved in the situation in Cyprus.3. On 23 February 1976, Foreign Ministers issued a statement of principles on Angola and Southern Africa in which they condemned externalmilitary intervention in Africa and expressed inter alia the readiness of the nine to develop a co-operative relationship with African states and the rightof the peoples of Rhodesia and Namibia to self-determination and independence. Following this, on 1-2 March the Heads of Government ofthe Community, meeting in the European Council, issued a public statementexpressing their support for British policy on Rhodesia and urging theWhite Rhodesian population to accept a peaceful transition to majority rule.They reiterated their determination to continue to apply Security Councilresolutions concerning Rhodesia (including those on sanctions).4. The Nine are continuing to consult closely on Southern Africanissues and are examining actively ways in which the Community and member states can make a positive contribution to developments in that region, forexample by co-ordinating their additional bilateral aid programmes.5. The Nine continue to attach great importance to the Euro-ArabDialogue as a means of building a constructive relationship with the arab states.. It is hoped that the first meeting of the General Commission in luxembourg in May will give further impetus to the work at expert levelin a number of economic, technical and cultural fields.6. At its meeting in Rome in December 1975 the European Counciladopted a proposal by the United Kingdom that Community Ministers ofthe Interior (or Ministers with similar responsibilities) should meet to discuss matters of common interest, in particular with regard to law and order.Preparations have been made for a first meeting of Ministers, which it ishoped to hold within the next two months.* Gmad. 6349.1168041 a-
Section IBL  External Relations: Trade aad AidMeJtilateral Trade Negotiations7. Work on the liberalisation of tariff and non-tariff barriers to tradeis continuing in the GATT Multilateral Trade Negotiations (MTNs) inwhich the Commission represents the Conirflunity on the basis of the mandateadopted by the Council of Ministers in February 1975 and in the light of regular co-ordination meetings with the Member States. At the Conferenceof Heads of State and Governments at Rambouillet in November 1975 ftwas agreed that the negotiations should aim at achieving the maximumliberalisation of trade and that they should be completed by the end of1977. This agreement was subsequently endorsed by the Trade NegotiationsCommittee, the supervisory body of the MTNs.8. Particular attention is being paid in the negotiations to the problemsfacing the developing countries. On 5 April the Council of Ministers adopted a broadly-based Community offer containing significant improvements inaccess to the Community market for tropical agricultural products of interestto these countries. It is envisaged that the concessions in the offer will be implemented from 1 January 1977.Mt4Kiinimii Countries9. In January the Community concluded new trade agreements withAlgeria, Morocco and Tunisia which were formally signed in the capitalsof the countries concerned on 25-27 April. They will replace the provisionsof the trade agreements signed by Morocco and Tunisia in 1969 with, theCommunity of Six; and they include financial protocols providing for Com-munity aid in the form of grants and loans over the next 5 years.10. On 9 December 1975 under the Community&apos;s &quot; overall approachrto relations with the countries of the Mediterranean basin, the Council ofMinisters agreed on a mandate for negotiations with Egypt, Syria, jordan and Lebanon. Negotiations with the first three of these countries started at the beginning of February, and it is hoped that agreements on lines broadly similar to the new agreements with the Maghreb countries will be concludedwithin the next few months.11. In December the Community negotiated new agreements with Maltaextending the existing Association Agreement to the new Member Statesand enlarging its provisions. These agreements and the related f&quot;&quot;wcmlprotocol were signed in Brussels on 4 March.Spsfa12, The Council of Ministers agreed at its meeting on 2 March that negotiations for a trade agreement between Spain and the enlarged community, which were broken off in October 1975. could be resumed.Greece13. In January the Commission put forward their opinion, in accordancewith Article 237 of the e.c. Treaty, on Greece&apos;s arrolication for fullCommunity membership. At their meeting on 9 February, Foreign ministers of the Coinmunity pronounced unanimously in favour of the application,and decided that preliminary work should be undertaken rapidly in orderto allow negotiations with Greece to be opened as soon as possible.it.  t
Portagal14. Negotiations have continued on revisions to the tree trade agreementbetween Portugal and the Community. The Council of Ministers has agceedthat the agreement should be extended to cover employment matters, social security, and technological and financial co-operation.Trade and Economic Co-operation Agreements- 15. The Community initialled a commercial co-operation agreementwith Pakistan in March. Its provisions are similar to those of the agreementwith India which was signed in 1973.ban16. In March the Commission reported to the Council of Ministers onthe outcome of exploratory talks with Iranian Ministers and officials onIran&apos;s future relations with the Community, and prepared proposals for anEEC/Iran commercial and economic co-operation agreement Theseproposals, are currently under consideration in the Community.Canada17. Negotiations started in March between the Community and Canadaon a framework agreement for economic and commercial co-operation.Textiles18. The Community has negotiated further agreements under the GATTMiritifibre Arrangement with the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Japan,Colombia and Brazil. Other outstanding negotiations with its majorsuppliers of low-cost textiles should be concluded in the near future. Anumber of these agreements were debated in House of Commons standing committees on 14 and 28 January 1976.State Trading Countries19. In February the Council for Mutual Economic Aid (CMEA) putforward on behalf of its member states (Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia,the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Mongolia, Poland, Romaniaand the Soviet Union) a draft of a possible agreement with the Community.This followed the Community^ offer in November 1974 to engage in trade negotiations with each of the state trading countries for the conclusion of agreements to replace the bilateral trade agreements negotiated by individualEEC countries, which have virtually all been ternunated. At its meetingon 2 March, the Council of Ministers took note of the CMEA proposals,which are now under study.Generalised Scheme of Preference!20. In November 1975 the Council of Ministers agreed on the 1976arrangements for the Community&apos;s Generalised Scheme of Preferences, which provides concessions on access into the Community for imports from an the developing countries. These arrangements included a number of improvedconcessions both in the industrial sector where ceilings and quota limits havebeen increased and in the agricultural sector where the preferential rates of duty applied to most products have been reduced. Some agriculturalprotractor of major interest to the Asian Commonwealth countries have been included in the Scheme fox the first time.1680411*2
CffiC/UNCTAD21, The Heads of Government agreed at the meeting of the EuropeanCouncil on 1-2 December on arrangements for Community representation at the Ministerial meeting of the Conference on International economic co-operation, which was held in Paris from 16-18 December. While theCommunity spokesman will normally be the Presidency or Commission,these arrangements provide for individual members of the CommunityDelegation to be invited by the Presidency to comment on specific questions in the context of the mandate, provided that such statements do not conflict with the agreed Community position. The same procedures apply to community participation in the four Commissions of the Conference-onenergy, raw materials, finance and development which were set up by the ministerial Conference. The Commissions have met three times, inFebruary. March and April. The work of the Commissions has been kept under review by the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs). While thecountries of the Community are to be separately represented at the fourthmeeting of UNCTAD, to be held in Nairobi in May, preparations for this,as for the CIEC, have been closely co-ordinated within the Coaimuiutyfwhich regards both bodies as important in the continuing dialogue betweenindustrialised and developing countries.Ike Iam&amp; Convention* 22. The hom6 Convention has now been ratified and formally came into force on 1 April 1976. The Convention, which runs to 1980, providesfor trade. fiimncwrt and technical co-operation between the Community and46 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (the ACP countries). Its tradeprovisions, which were brought into effect on an interim basis on 1 July1975, give the ACP countries improved access to the markets of the Nine;similar benefits have been extended to most of the United Kingdom&apos;sretraining dependent territories.iS. Work is already well under way to identify projects in the developing countries which will be eligible for finance bom the 3,150 million units of account (mua) allocated to the fourth European Development Fund, TheACP countries&apos; export earnings are being assessed to establish whichcountries are eligible to receive payments under the Communir/s Export.Wdfrtfty Stabilisation Scheme (STABEX). Discussions are also takingMace within the Community and with the ACP countries to establish the^tetre for Industrial Development provided for under the chapter of theConvention dealing with industrial co-operation.Ofer Aspects of Commmmktj Aid Policy-r : 24. The Council of Ministers (Development) met on 8 April but no agreement was reached on the release of 20 mua included for the non-associated developing countries in the 1976 Community budget by theEuropean Assembly, or on a Community contribution to the InternationalFund for Agricultural Development. The failure to agree on aid to the hon-ftssocUtes was disappointing and the United Kingdom will continueto pursue this aim. There have also been contmuing diBcustioas onharm oniia lion and co-ordination of Member States&apos; bilateral poifcaet.
Section TV. Agrkaltare mi Fisheriesv -25. The United Kingdom has continued to seek improvements in theoperation of the common agricultural policy in order to keep down the costto&quot; the Community budget and the level of prices in the interest of theconsumer and, where possible, to discourage the production of surpluses.26. The Commission^ proposals for Community agricultural support and prices in 1976-77 were presented in December 1975 and were debated in the House of Lords on 3 February and in the Commons on 12 February.Agreement on the prices for the 1976-77 farm year was reached by theCouncil of Ministers (Agriculture) at its meeting on 2-6 March.1 As aresult, of these decisions United Kingdom farmers will receive support in1.976-77 which should help to ensure a substantial recovery in agriculturaloutput When taken together with the next transitional step required underthe Accession Treaty and the increases in United Kingdom prices arisingfrom the domestic 1976 Annual Review, the total effect on the cost of livingby the first quarter of next year is estimated to he an increase of aboutIp in the pound.Monetary Arrangements.,\-27.&apos;- During this period the monetary compensatory amounts financed bythe, Community (which partly shield the United Kingdom consumer fromthe effects of any fall in the market rate for the   on the price of importedfood) rose from 6-4 per cent to 19-2 per cent, which is equivalent to an estimated annual import subsidy of over  200 million. At its meeting on29 April, the Council of Ministers considered the cost to the community budget arising from changes in the market rates for sterling and the lira.It agreed that the representative rate for the lira should be adjusted byabout 6 per cent, and that the monetary compensatory amounts payable on imports into the United Kingdom and Italy from the other seven member states would be paid in the exporting country. These payments will continueto he an effective subsidy on the foods we importMilk Products&apos; 28. Over-production of milk products continues to be one of the major problems facing the Community. At its meeting in March the Council, ofMinisters agreed that the target price for milk in 1976-77 should rise intwo stages, giving an average increase for the year of about 6 per centThis increase will however be -lower in some major producing countriesbecause of the monetary changes made as part of the price-fixing package,and it will also be offset by deductions made from the intervention price for  ^mmrd milk powder. For most countries the decisions amount to a.reduction in support levels in real terms.29. The Council also agreed a number of measures aimed directly atreducing surpluses in the milk sector. At its meeting in November if adopted two proposals, one suspending the inward processing arrangementsArr teKer and butter oil, and the other releasing intervention stocksdY&apos; slammed milk powder for incorporation into animal feed for exportAitmeqUmdy. as part of the price-fixing package, the Council agreed to
dispose of a quantity of skimined milk powder by a temporary scheme ofdeposits to ensure its use in animal feedingstuffs. It also agreed to increasetin amount of skimmed milk powder which the Community makes availablefor food aid. A proposal to aid storage of certain other protein productswas brought forward but it was the subject of an adverse opinion from theEuropean Assembly and has not so far been adopted. This proposal andthe scheme for incorporating skimmed milk powder in feedingstuffs weredebated in the House of Commons on 12 April.30.&apos; The Council intend to reach a decision in the autumn on the way in which Community milk producers should make a financial contributionto. restoring the balance in that sector., &apos; 31. The Council also agreed a measure to control the fat content, of whole milk on a basis which will enable United Kingdom producers tocontinue selling whole milk with a fat content which has not beenstandardised.Beef32. At its meeting in March the Council agreed that the possibility of paying a slaughter premium to producers should be maintained. In addition,the Conimission undertook to produce by November a detailed report onthe respective merits of the premium system and intervention arrangements.The Council also agreed at its meeting in December to the allocation of the gatt tariff quota for frozen beef for 1976.Cereals33. At its meeting in March the Council agreed arrangements for a two-tier system of raterventiofi for wheat so as to achieve a better relation-ship between the support prices for different feed grains. As a result thereiS to be separate support for breadmaking and feed wheat with the effectiveintervention level for feed wheat in 1976-77 equivalent to mat for barley,and&apos; about 8 per cent lower than the basic intervention price for wheat in1975-76. Wheat of breadmaking quality will attract a higher interventionprice than feed wheat during 1976-77; thereafter the Council intend tosupport it by means of a reference price. Discussions are continuing at a technical level on a suitable test to distinguish between breadmaking andfeed wheatWise34. The Council has again devoted much time to the long standingproblems in the wine sector, and eventually agreed at its March meetingon arrangements for tackling the immediate problems created by Surplusesand on long term measures for improving the structure of the industry?Suitable arrangements were agreed to safeguard the British wine industry.fotatoes35. The Council considered a number of measures to alleviate tteshortage of potatoes in the Community. In January it agreed to sutpoixFthe Common Customs Tariff on new and mam crop potatoes until the enfrof. March.  These suspensions were subsequently extended to 20 May and
3ftJuhe respectively.  The Council also adopted at its meeting in February&apos;tf regulation imposing an export tax on potatoes exported to third counrriea.The Commission submitted in January a proposal for a regulation to establishacemmon organisation of die market in potatoes.Matton and Lamb- 36. The Council had a preliminary discussion at its meeting in Decemberof a proposal which the Commission submitted in September for a regulationto establish an interim common organisation of the market in sheepmeat.The United Kingdom stressed that any such regulation would need to takefiiily into account the wide differences which exist between the circumstancesdetaining in the Member States most directly concerned, and the heavy&apos;dependence of the Community on third country imports especially from new Zealand: The Council agreed that officials should consider theproposals further and report back.New Zealand Dairy Products37.  At its meeting in November the Council agreed that the price&apos;received by New Zealand for butter and cheese should be increased by18 per cent from 1 January 1976: and at its meeting in April it resumeddiscussion of the Commission^ recommendation on access for New Zealanddairy products in 1978 to 1980.Sngar38.  The Council agreed at its March meeting to increase the minimumsugar beet price by 8 per cent for the 1976-77 year.  This is well below&quot; the substantial price increase paid to Community producers in 1975-76,after a period in which the sugar market had suffered a serious deficit in supplies. The Council also agreed that measures should be taken to containCommunity production by reducing the size of maximum quotas; and thatthe cost of disposing of Community sugar surpluses should again be borneby the producer through the reintroducrion of the levy on production betweenbasic and maximum quotas. At its April meeting, the Council agreed upon  negotiating mandate for the opening of discussions with the ACP sugarproducing countries on prices for 1976-77.Agricultural Structure39. At its meeting in January the Council had a preliminary discussion on Commission proposals covering producer groups, aids for the processingand marketing of agricultural produce, aids to young farmers and afforestation-tion.Fhheriet40. Following the CounciFs agreement in April 1975 that the CommonFisheries Policy should be reappraised to take account of the new circurn-stances arising from the likely extension of fisheries jurisdiction theCommission produced an analysis of the problem and, in a communication to^the Council, proposed that the fisheries resources in waters of member states should be shared on the basis of a quota system, with reserved beltsof 12 miles width for coastal states. This matter h now before the Council,
The Government, while accepting the communication as a basis for oi**cession; are seeking significant improvements notably with respect to the coastal arrangements. The United Kingdom also pressed at the Council ofMinisters in April 1976 for measures to strengthen the fish market in theCommunity, and the Commission agreed to produce proposals as soon aspossible.Section V. Economic and Monetary QuestionTSe 1*7* Bndget. 41. The draft 1976 Budget established by the Council of Ministers on29 September was debated in the House of Commons on 6 November andhi the Lords on 7 November. It was returned to the Council with thej^^iemMyV observations and proposals on 14 November. The Assemblyproposed increases in provision totalling 441 mua (approximately 180 million) above the level of the draft budget (7/172 mua; about 3,100 million). Following discussion by the Council of Ministers, on.3 December these increases were reduced by 335 mua (about  140 million);the Budget was finally adopted on,18 December.h 4Z The Budget at adopted amounts to 7,577 mua (about  3,150 million);&amp;&apos;increase of apprc^umately 21 per cent over the 1975 Budget Theincrease is partly due to inflation and partly to expansion of existingjCommunity policies. Expenditure on the Guarantee Section of the EuropeanAgricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund has been increased by sottft920 mua (about  380 million), expenditure on the Regional development fund by 150 mua (about  60 million) and expenditure.by the EuropeanSocial Fund by 75 raua (about  30 million).lie CommanUy Budget Timetable&apos; 43. In March it was decided that, experimentally, the timetable forconsideration of the 1977 Budget should be advanced. Tins was in response to a proposal made by the United Kingdom Government in order to auowmore time for consideration of the preliminary draft budget Under the revised timetable the preliminary draft budget is expected to be presented to the Council of Ministers on 15 June, instead of by 1 September as anderthe present timetable.Broader Budgetary Ivaes: - &quot;44. In accordance with the decision of the European Council on1^2 December in Rome Foreign and Finance Ministers held their first arairialJoint Meeting on 5 April 1976 to take an overall look at budgetary problems,in the context of the Commumty&apos;s general policies and to establish expendi-ture priorities. The discussion win form the background to the preparation^of the 1977 BudgetFinancial Centra; ;45. The European Council on 1-2 December 1975 also xtiacuased fluettoftedllUngdonis suggestions for improving financial control within theGtomfrtunity together with related suggestions put forward by the federal german Chancellor and the Commission. The European Council broadly
endorsed these suggestions. In particular it invited the President of. theCouncil of Ministers and the President of the Commission to examine withthe President of the Assembly the role which the Assembly might play incontrolling Community expenditure; it agreed to make every, effort to ensureearly ratification of the Treaty setting up a European Court of Auditors;it welcomed the Commission^ decision to strengthen the powers of the member of the Commission responsible for the Budget; and also set general terms of reference for the proposed annual joint meeting of Foreign and finance Ministers. The full text of the United Kingdom&apos;s proposals and thestatement from the European Council were later published as a White-Paper ** Financial Control in the European Community &quot;.*46. In March the Assembly&apos;s Budgets Committee reactivated its Sub*Cdnnnittee on * control of implementation&apos;. This sub-committee, with newterms of reference, is intended to fulfil within the Community the role per-formed in this country by the Public Accounts Committee.FJconomlt and Monetary Co-operationjl.47. At their regular meetings Community Finance Ministers have&apos;discussed the economic situation, in particular the problem of the persistenthigh, level of unemployment brought about by the recession; the need to,implement fully the co-ordinated measures to stimulate economic activity!decided in the summer, and to make further progress in combating inflation.Guidelines for economic policy in 1976 consistent with these objectives were adopted by Ministers in the course of formal examinations of the economic-situation in November 1975 and in March 1976.48. Finance Ministers also met informally in December 1975 in pre-paration for discussion of reform of the international monetary system atthe meeting of the International Monetary Fund Interim Committee inJanuary. On 15 March the Council, acting under the powers which enabled the Community to raise loans for on-lending to Member States in balanceof payments difficulties as a result of the oil crisis, authorised the Commissionto borrow $1,000 million on behalf of Italy and $300 million on behalf ofIreland. The total borrowing would be raised by a combination of publicbond issues and private placings with banking syndicates. Following a seriesof disturbances in the exchange markets during March the French francwithdrew from the Community exchange system (the Snake).Unemployment49. High unemployment is affecting all Community countries, and in,February the Economic and Social Committee adopted an Opinion. Thesubject was discussed, by the Council of Ministers in March and, at thesuggestion of the United Kingdom, by the European Council in AprilFinance Ministers devoted a special informal meeting to the subject pi26&quot; April and the matter was further discussed by Social Affairs Ministers fljf30 April. There was agreement in the Community on the importance of bringing down unemployment Discussion on both short and mpdfrm termaspects of this problem will be carried forward and will include consultationiat an early date with representatives of employers&apos; organisations and tradeutuons.* Cmnd, 6360.
v 50. A Council of Ministers (Fiscal) was held on 24 November 1975to discuss the Commissions Action Programme for Taxation and the draft&apos;.Sixth Directive on VAT. In general the Council welcomed the Commiiek)tt&apos;frAction Programme as a useful summary of future work, although view-about the timetable differed. On the Sixth Directive, the Council.diicosBedsome of the points of particular difficulty for Member States and supported&quot;greater flexibility in the approach to these problems. In particular they recognised the importance of allowing Member States to continue to OperaWtheir existing zero rates. Further discussion will be necessary before final agreement can be reached. This is to some extent linked with the detailedmechanism for the implementation of the VAT element of the &quot;own resources&quot; system for which fully detailed proposals have not yet beensubmitted to the Council..51. In February 1976 a draft Fifth Directive on Tobacco Taxation was&quot;published. Earlier Directives provide for a first stage in the harmonisationof excise duty on cigarettes, terrninating on 30 June 1977, during wbichthespecific (per cigarette) element of the duty may range between 5 per centatui.75 per cent of the total duty, die remaining element to be levied as a^percentage of retail selling price. The United Kingdom has a derogation&apos;until the end of 1977. but has begun to move towardsthe harmonised system&quot;with the proposal in the 1976 Budget to introduce a 20 per cent ad valorem,doty on cigarettes^ The new draft Directive envisages a second&apos; stage ofhattnonisation during which the specific element will range between IS peYcent and 50 per cent of the total duty and VAT combined.Section VI.

Consideration continued of the Second draft Directive on the forma-:tton and capital of companies and the Fourth draft Directive on companyaccounts. Work also began on the Commissions proposal for a EuropeanCompanies Statute, but this may take some years to complete. In November1975 the Ccannussion published a consultative &quot; Green Paper &quot; on WorkerParticipation and the Structure of Companies on which interested partieawere invited to submit their views. Following this they intend to communi-cate to the Council a revised version of the Fifth draft Directive on thestricture of companies.
