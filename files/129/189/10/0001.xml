THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 10 COPY no. 7 May 1976CABINET81CIVIL, SERVICE manpower memorandum by the Central Policy Review staff the TARGETS1.        As a final and important contribution towards the target savings in public expenditure, Ministers agreed (CC(75) 55th Conclusions,December 1975) to reduce the 1975 Public Expenditure Survey (PESC)forecast size of the Civil Service in 1978-79 (772, 000) by 5 per cent(about 38, 500) thereby saving  140 million.    The figure of  140 million was made public in the White Paper cm Public Expenditure (Cmnd 6393).On manpower. Parliament was told (Hansard, Col. 1586 of 5 February 1976)that reductions were being considered &quot;so that by 1978 the Civil Service ismuch more like the size it was last summer including the ManpowerServices Commission&quot; (i.e. about 730, 000).   The Lord Privy Sealrepeated this target to the conference of the Institute of ProfessionalCivil Servants on 4 May.2,        ministers decisions were in general terms and the possibleimplications for the provision of public services had not been worked out.It was assumed that a &quot;5 per cent cut in manpower&quot; was roughly within themargins of possible improvements in efficiency and the cutting out of unnecessary policies and practices.    However, subsequent analysis hasshown that it is more complicated than this.THE MAIN PROBLEMS3.        The first main problem is the nature of the commitment.   Areduction of  140 million or a 5 per cent cut in manpower on the 1975 PESCforecasts is not the same as an undertaking to reduce the else of the CivilService by 1978-79 to about 730, 000.4.       As a result of revised forecasts and new commitments, particularlyin the &quot;demand related&quot; areas of tax collection and social securitypayments, the estimated size of the Civil Service In 1978-79 Is now 16, 000higher than the PESC forecast.    Moreover, there are bound to be more new commitments over the horizon.   Against this these additional demands willin part be offset by the agreed reduction of between 6, 500 and 9, 000 on the1975 forecast for defence manpower.1
5.        In consequence, to achieve a target of 730, 000 by 1978-79 wouldrequire a reduction of about 50, 000 on the most recent Civil service manpower forecasts (which is a reduction of 6  per cent rather than5 per cent).    Moreover, any further manpower increases agreed between now and 1978-79 will also need to be offset by further compensatingreductions.6,        The second main problem is that whatever reductions are agreedthere cannot be an arbitrary and equal cut across the board.    The Annexesto the paper by the Lord Privy Seal (CP(76) 9) show how the decision to exempt certain Departments or services means a much greater problem for the remaining Departments.    For instance, the exclusion of Defencefrom the exercise (given that they are contributing between 6, 500 and, 000 under a separate exercise) means that a target reduction of 6^ per cent for the Civil Service as a whole becomes a target reduction of il  per cent for Departments other than Defence.DISCUSSION7.        There is no doubt that following the various Ministerial statementsthat have been made, the public is expecting a reduction in Civil service manpower to about 730, 000 by 1978-79.    But the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s paperassumes that the Government cannot, in practice, achieve any significant reduction.    It suggests that the best we can do is to try to achieve cuts incertain places, and to accept that even with these cuts the numbers in theCivil Service in 1978-79 are likely to be still as large then as they are today.8.        So the first and basic question is - what is the target?   UntilMinisters have decided, in the light of the more detailed examination ofthe problem presented in the papers now before them, what is their target for savings in manpower for 1978-79, it is difficult to know how radical an approach is required.   At present, as is explained in the Lord Privy Seal*s paper, certain Departments have been excluded from contributing beyondsavings previously agreed.    If Ministers decide that the manpower figure for 1978-79 really must be about 730, 000, then assumptions such as these will probably need to be re-examined.9.        But there is no need to wait before taking some action.    On anyoutcome, the savings set out in Annex A of the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s paperare certain to be needed.    Since any manpower saving takes time thereis much to be said for accepting the proposals in Annex A forthwith.    Theextent to which the proposals in Annex B would be adequate, or whetherothers even more radical and painful need to be considered, will dependvery much on the decisions that Ministers come to on the target for1978-79.2
QUESTIONS FOR MINISTERS10.       Ministers will clearly find it difficult to agree all the details Inone meeting.    The CPRS therefore suggests that the main questions for decision at this meeting are:1. First and moat important, what is the target?   having made commitments to cut Civil Service manpower do they feelthat this somehow has to be achieved even if the consequences forpolicy are quite radical?   If so, do they wish to aim at the target of 730, 000 by 1978-79 or will something between 730, 000 and750, 000 be good enough?U.        Can the proposed savings set out in Annex A to theLord Privy Seal&apos;s paper be accepted now as being necessaryin any case?iii. Having agreed the target, would Ministers agree that thenext steps should be bilateral discussions between the Lord privy seal and Departmental Ministers to see how the remaining savingsmight be achieved?iv. Since Annex A and Annex B together would still not mean a significant reduction in Civil Service manpower by 1978-79,should Departments hitherto excluded from this exercise now beincluded ?Cabinet office May 19763
