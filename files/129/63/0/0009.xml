Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1953SECRETC. (53) 25925th September, 1953WHITE PAPER ON HOUSING policy memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentI was impressed by the argument used in Cabinet (C.C. (53) 52nd Conclusions,Minute 1) that the repairs increase should follow the logic of the argument, andbe allowed to rise to a maximum of twice instead of one-and-a-half times thestatutory deduction (S.D.).It is certainly true that economists in general, and The Economist journalin particular, will take this line.The reason why I was unwilling to follow the logical course was my fear thatthe increases might seem very heavy in percentage, if not in money terms onthe low rents.Many of these are 4s., 5s. and 6s. Under twice the S.D. they might well allsuffer an increase of 4s. Id. (double or nearly double).But, of course, this difficulty is inherent in my scheme. It is meant to bearmore hardly on the small rents, and less severely on the larger rents, where thehouses are similar in value and amenities.I have prepared tables showing the effect of the two methods \% S.D. and2 S.D. on houses in different categories. I have also prepared alternative para-graphs (Annex) for the White Paper if the Cabinet prefers to accept the morelogical but more severe scheme.It will be seen, then, that for the two categories of houses  15 and  25 grossvalue, under \\ S.D. the maximum repair increases are 3s. 6d. and 4s. respectively,as against 4s. Id. and 5s. 5d. if we go to 2 S.D.The maximum rent (that is, twice the gross value) is naturally the same ineach case- viz. 11 s. 6d. and 19s. 3d. respectively..On the whole since it is said that one might as well hang for a sheep as alamb-1 should be inclined to go for 2 S.D. This will certainly assist our realobject to get the repairs done. It will also help the Chancellor of the Exchequer,since local authorities will be encouraged to increase their rents more boldly.But I must then hold, even more tenaciously, to the two conditions which mustbe satisfied before any rent can rise:(a) the state of the house;(b) the actual expenditure of the money on repairs.I am prepared, however, to give the landlord an option on (b). Either hecan have spent the money over the last (say) two years, or be spending it withina certain time in the future. This, however, will be left to the Bill, and put onlyin general terms in the White Paper.From the political point of view, I feel that the association of actual repairsbeing done, in the present, the future, or the not too remote past, is more important than the precise figure of the maximum permitted increase, especially when weremember in how many cases something less than the maximum will be due(because the rent is already rather higher).But, with so much at stake, I should like the Cabinet to decide, with a full knowledge of the facts presented as clearly as I am able.H.

kmANNEXAlternative Paragraphs tc- Draft White PaperParagraph 23: Transfer to follow the present paragraph 34.Paragraph 33: Consequential on above, omit the sentence in; brackets in the14th and 15th lines.Paragraph 35 : To read: &quot; It follows, since the cost of repairs is now just over three times what it was in 1939, that a repairs increase of twice the statutorydeduction would enable landlords to repair and maintain houses to the standardthey adopted in 1939. Accordingly, Her Majesty&apos;s Government propose that therepairs increase should be an amount equal to twice the statutory deduction.&quot;Paragraph 36 : To read: &quot; But, since (as already pointed out) the rents of somehouses are already high, it is proposed, in order to provide some brake to thisrepairs increase, that no rent should, by reason of the proposal in the preceding paragraph, rise above twice the existing gross value of the house.&quot;Paragraph 37: To read: &quot; The effect of these proposals, taken together, onhouses in the different gross value groups can be appreciated by looking at thefigures in Appendix II.&quot; One or two examples will illustrate it. Take a house with an existing grossvalue for rating of  15. The statutory deduction is  6. The repairs increaseallowed under these proposals would be  12 per annum or 4s. Id. a week. But the rent may not, by reason of these proposals, increase beyond twice the gross value;that is, beyond  30. per annum or 11s. 6d. a week. If the present rent is less than6s. lid. a week it may increase by the full 4s. Id. If it is more than 6s. lid. theincrease is less than 4s. Id. If it is already 11s. 6d. a week or more there is no increase.&quot; Or take a house with an existing gross value of  25. The statutory deductionis  7. The repairs increase in this case would be  14 per annum, or 5s. 5d. a week;and the highest figure to which the rent could be increased would be  50 perannum or 19s. 3d. a week. If the present rent is less than 13s. lOd. a week it may increase by the full 5s. 5d. If it is more than 13s. lOd. a week the increase is lessthan 5s. 5d. If it is already 19s. 3d. a week or more there is no increase.&quot; The great majority over 5 million out of a total of about 6 million-ofhouses subject to rent restriction have at present a gross value for rating of lessthan  30. Over 4 million of them have a gross value for rating of less than 20 10s. The first example therefore is the most characteristic; and the twoexamples together cover five-sixths of all the houses affected by the proposals.&quot;
