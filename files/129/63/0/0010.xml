Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1953SECRETC. (53) 26025th September, 1953CABINETGOVERNMENT INFORMATION SERVICES AND THE DROGHEDAREPORTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations the Report of the Independent Committee of Enquiry into the overseas information Services, under the Chairmanship of Lord Drogheda, has now been presented. It contains a penetrating analysis of the work and functions of the overseas services and makes many valuable recommendations for the improvementof those services in future.2. But it seems to me that we should not proceed with the implementation of these recommendations until Ministers have taken a decision on the shape ofour Information Services as a whole and the functions which we should wish themto carry out. This is no reflection on the Report of the Drogheda committee itself, which contains extremely valuable documentation. By their terms of refer-ence the Committee were required to deal with the machine as they found it, andhad no mandate to tackle changes of high policy.3. I set out below certain general considerations which I think call for decision by Ministers before we can deal with the Drogheda Report in detail.4. In the first place, it must be accepted that finance is a limiting factor.Whatever we may eventually decide may be the figure which we can afford forinformation work as a whole, we cannot afford the earth and cannot do all thosethings which we might wish. It is no good doing a lot of things indifferently; wemust concentrate on what matters most and do that really well. This may mean that, while some activities can be expanded, others will have to be suppressed,and this may involve a re-casting of the functions of all the organisations at present engaged in information activities.5. In my view, what is required is a new appreciation and assessment of thefront on which we now have to fight. I suggest that the most important front isproduction and exports and that, in the world as it is to-day, our need is to sellBritain as a great industrial country with great assets, moral, physical and scientific.If this is accepted, far greater emphasis requires to be laid on this aspect in future and the various services should be geared to further this aim.6. I do not underrate the importance of our Information Services in thepolitical and strategic sphere (and these Services must be ready and equipped toput over any aspect of British policy that we want to expound to particular countries or to the world) or the great importance of continuing to combat Com-communism by every means at our disposal. But what is required for the last is a positive answer to the false appeal of Communism, and, by showing the strengthof Britain in this way, we shall be fighting the battle against Communism in themost successful manner.7. I do not see how detailed consideration can be given to the DroghedaReport by Departments until Ministers have decided these questions of policy.What the various Services-the Central Office of Information, Overseas Informa-tion Services, British Council and British Broadcasting Overseas Services-should do and refrain from doing; and to a large extent the composition of the Services,44906CAB IfHECORD\j r r i \fT\ D copy No.

I suggest therefore that the Ministers chiefly concerned should meet andlay down policy, and give broad directives on which officials can get to work onthe Report.8. I would ask too that the system of Direction should be considered atthe same time the first thing is to decide the campaign we want to fight. Butto fight the campaign effectively there must be constant strategic direction fromthe Centre and effective control by the Commanders in the field. The first must come from Ministers; the second requires that Ambassadors and High Commis-sioners should have sufficient control over all the Forces in their sectors to ensurethat the Ministerial directives are carried out.9. In this connection I would make a suggestion about the Central Officeof Information which may well be required to expand some of its activities, andwhich certainly has an important part to play and a good deal of capacity for thework. But the Central Office of Information has suffered, I think, both in morale and effectiveness for lack of top level direction and contacts. It is convenient thatthe Central Office of Information should be under the Financial Secretary to theTreasury for finance and discipline; but I would propose that for policy it should look for direction to the Minister responsible for Government Public Relations,or to the Minister for Overseas Trade or both these Ministers.SWINTON.
