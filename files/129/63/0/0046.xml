TheWhite Paper explains that this will involve legislation and that it must, therefore,be some time before the Corporation can be brought into existence. The white paper promises an Order in Council which will in the meantime transfer ministerial responsibility for atomic energy from the Minister of Supply to the Lord Presidentof the Council, who will be the Minister eventually responsible to Parliament forthe Corporation. The Order in Council itself will be submitted to Parliamentearly in December and the transfer will take place on the earliest date thereafter,i.e., 1st January, 1954.I hope my colleagues will agree that the White Paper should be publishedforthwith.C.Copy No.  *2 ^Paymaster General&apos;s Office, S.W.1,21st October, 1953.45042a
THE FUTURE ORGANISATION OFTHE UNITED kingdom atomic ENERGY PROJECTPresented by the to parliament by Command of Her Majesty1953Crad.
THE   FUTURE   ORGANISATION   OF   THE   UNITED  kingdom atomic ENERGY PROJECT1. From the time the present Government came into office, it has thoughtthat atomic energy development in this country has reached a stage whichmight require a change in the nature of the controlling organisation.2. On 15th November, 1951, the Prime Minister informed the Houseof Commons (Col. 1162) that he was considering what adjustments shouldbe made in the existing statutory responsibilities of the Minister of supply for atomic energy questions. On 24th March, 1952 (Col. 22), he informed the House that in view of important experiments to be made in the autumn(the atomic weapon test at Monte Bello in October 1952) it was not theappropriate moment to make radical changes in the existing arrangementsor to create a new organisation on a long-term basis.3. Immediately after the successful completion of the Monte Bello testa review of. the existing arrangements was put in hand, and on 28th April,1953 (Cols. 1966-1972), the Prime Minister informed the House that theGovernment had decided in principle that responsibility for atomic energy should be transferred from the Ministry of Supply to a non-Departmental organisation, and had appointed a Committee consisting ofLord Waverley (Chairman), Sir Wallace Akers and Sir John Woods, withthe following reference : &quot; To devise a plan for transferring responsibility for atomic energyfrom the Ministry of Supply to a non-Departmental organisation and towork out the most suitable form for the new organisation, due regard being paid to any constitutional and financial implications.&quot;4. During the war, work on atomic energy was entrusted to a specialdirectorate under the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Atthe end of the war, the position of the United Kingdom in atomic energywork was such that an almost completely fresh start had to be made. Most ofour leading scientists in this field had been transferred to the United states in 1943, when it was decided that the production of atomic bombs must be concentrated on the other side of the Atlantic,* and with their departuremost of the work in progress here had to be closed down. Moreover, Britishindustry inevitably had much more limited opportunities than its counterpartin the United States to take an active part in the war-time development ofthe completely novel techniques which had to be employed. When the warended, large industrial concerns in the United Kingdom which might, in other circumstances, have been able and willing to undertake major tasks in thefield of atomic energy found their resources fully committed to the task of reconversion to peace-time production in order to meet the overridingneed for the rebuilding of our exports.5. In these circumstances only a Government-sponsored organisation could provide the financial and other resources needed for the novel, complicated and costly establishments which research and development would require.The choice lay between an ordinary Government Department and some formof non-Departmental organisation; and in the autumn of 1945 the Governmentof the day decided that the task should be entrusted to the Ministry of Supplywhich, owing to the contraction of its war-time responsibilities, had at its disposal a wide range of surplus facilities and resources, and much war-timeexperience of quasi-industrial problems. The new arrangements were givenstatutory form in the Atomic Energy Act, 1946.* The United Kingdom&apos;s contribution to the Anglo-American war-time effort is described in &quot; Statements relating to the atomic bomb &quot;.   (H,M,S.O., 1945.)
6. From the outset it was necessary to design and construct very largefactories to be run on industrial lines, for the production of fissile material,but for some years the keynote of the project was essentially research. as time went on, however, the massive size of the enterprise, and the growingimportance of weapons production and the industrial applications, began ,to mark it out as something quite exceptional in the range of Departmentalactivities.7. Although it was realised from the beginning that atomic energy hadboth civil and military possibilities, the latter represented for some time theonly concrete objective, for, while it had been demonstrated that an atomicbomb could be made, the technical foundation for the building of a nuclear power reactor had not yet been laid. By June 1952, enough progress hadbeen made for the Government to be able to approve the first civil reactorprogramme; and the Monte Bello test in October 1952, brought the productionof atomic weapons, as well as research and development, into the projectsfield of activity.8. It is, as the Minister of Supply stated in the House of Commons on26th January, 1953 (Col. 674), &quot; too early to say with any precision how soonelectricity generated from atomic energy will be available on a significantscale for industrial purposes.&quot; Even if the experimental work at present inhand shows that industrial power can be generated successfully and economically the great magnitude of the investment required must mean thatit will be decades before a large proportion of the country&apos;s electricity canbe generated by nuclear reactors. It is a common feature of all greatinnovations steam, electricity, internal combustion engines, aircraft -thatthere is a considerable interval between the first demonstration that the idea is practicable and the time when the new invention becomes a commonfeature of everyday life. But however crude and primitive our first nuclear power reactors may appear to future generations, we can look forward with confidence to the time when industrial power from the atom will be a major factor in the world&apos;s economy. Indeed, it is not too much to say that the exploitation of nuclear energy may come to be regarded as the most importantstep taken by man in the mastery of nature since the discovery of fire.9. But there is still a long way to go and much work to be done. thanks to its pioneer work, this country is well placed to play a leading part in these developments; and because of our strained resources, and the rising cost, of power from the sources which have been used hitherto it is particularly important that we should not be left behind in a race on which our industrialfuture may depend.10. An enterprise of this kind, requiring the development of many entirelynovel techniques, which in turn depend on many kinds of research, physical,chemical, metallurgical and engineering, on the very frontiers of knowledge,needs all the imagination and drive which we, as a nation, can provide; above all it calls for flexibility and for rapidity of decision.11. As the industrial uses of atomic energy become relatively moreprominent, the case for a form of control of the project which is more akin tothe structure of a big industrial organisation than to that of a Governmentdepartment becomes increasingly strong; and it will, in the Governments view,become stronger with the increase in the need for closer contact andco-operation with industry, including the nationalised industries, and the widening application of atomic techniques.12. It is considerations such as these which have led the Government to conclude that the most rapid and economical development in this field will
be secured by transferring responsibility from the Ministry of Supply to anon-Departmental organisation with the necessary executive power, within the framework of an approved policy and under a financial ceiling, to settle day-to-day problems. They believe that the necessary flexibility and speed of decision can best be obtained from the Board of an organisation run on industrial lines, and with no responsibility outside the field of atomic energy.They have noted that all the other countries working in this field have adoptedsome special form of organisation, outside the normal framework of an ordinary Government department.13. The Government recognised, however, that the transfer of responsi-bility from the Ministry of Supply to a non-Departmental organisation would present difficulties which would require careful study and which oughtto be thoroughly explored before a final decision could be reached. It wasalso clear that, because of the need for close control of policy by the Govern-ment, and the dependence of the organisation on public funds, the form of thenon-Departmental organisation would be bound to differ from that of anynow in existence. The Committee under Lord Waverley&apos;s Chairmanship wastherefore appointed. That Committee has considered the matter in detail, andhas produced a comprehensive report which deals with many matters which,for reasons of security, cannot be disclosed. The report cannot therefore bepublished in full; but a summary of the Committee&apos;s main recommendations is contained in the Appendix to this Memorandum.14. All these Recommendations have been accepted by the Government,and the necessary administrative preparations for giving effect to them are nowbeing made. The Minister responsible to Parliament for the future Corpora-tion will be the Lord President of the Council and an Order-in-Council underthe Ministers of the Crown (Transfer of Functions) Act, 1946, transferringresponsibility from the Minister of Supply to the Lord President of the council will be submitted to Parliament in due course. Later, a Bill will beintroduced to provide for the setting up of an Atomic Energy Corporation.15. In conclusion, it is desired to stress two points to which the PrimeMinister drew attention in his statement announcing the setting up of LordWaverley&apos;s Committee. First, overall policy will remain firmly in the handsof the Government. While the Corporation will be given freedom in theday-to-day management of its affairs, including its finances, its operationsmust be governed by Government directives which will lay down itsobjectives and direct its policy. Second, the rights and interests of theexisting staff will be fully respected, and consultation with staff representatives will take place at the appropriate time.
appendix summary of the Main Recommendations of Lord Waverley&apos;s CommitteeTransfer of Responsibility1. We recommend that an Atomic Energy Corporation should be estab-lished.  This should be a statutory Corporation with an executive Board.2. There should be transferred to this Corporation from the Ministryof Supply the responsibility for the establishments at present controlled bythe Atomic Energy Research Establishment; by the Production Division;and by the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment.3. The Ministry of Supply should continue to be responsible for the conventional components of atomic weapons.4. Well in advance of the vesting date, action should be taken to provide,in a form suitable for transfer to the Corporation, the majority of the common services provided at present by the Headquarters Divisions of the Ministryof Supply jointly for the Atomic Energy and other Establishments of that ministry.5. The question whether or not to use the Ministry of Works as an Agentfor building services should be left for decision until the Corporation is established.The designated Minister6. There should be designated a Minister responsible to Parliament formonies provided for the Corporation and for the policy directions given tothe Corporation. The main task of this Minister will be to ensure the well-being and efficiency of the Corporation as a whole and the maintenance ofa balance between the use of atomic energy for defence, for power and toan increasing extent in the biological applications, in conformity with policy laid down from time to time by Ministers collectively. This Minister shouldbe one of the existing Ministers of high Cabinet rank who has no departmental responsibilities which encroach upon the field of atomic energy. The mostsuitable Minister seems to be the Lord President of the Council. .. We do not,however, make a specific recommendation that he should be designatedsince there might be advantage in leaving it open to the Government ofthe day to consider which of the holders of the sinecure offices should becharged with this special and rather personal responsibility.7. There should be a Ministerial Committee representative of all theMinisters whose Departments are concerned with the various aspects of atomic energy. The designated Minister should be the Chairman of thisCommittee.8. The designated Minister would require a small group of officials to assist him. These officials should constitute a small department responsiblesolely to him and should not owe allegiance to any of the Departments having a particular interest in the applications of atomic energy.9. An Official Committee representative of all the Departments concernedwith atomic energy will be required as at present.10. The Corporation should at the outset be given a directive requiringit to consult the Official Committee on all matters of external policy.   The
channel of communications for agreed decisions on such matters of policy should be through the Foreign Office or the Commonwealth Relations office as the case may be.11. The Ministry of Defence should remain generally responsible, afterthe Corporation is set up, for the allocation of resources available for defence purposes between atomic weapons and conventional arms and for thedistribution of effort between the research, development and production of atomic weapons.Finance12. The Corporation^ expenditure will be very heavy and, at least formany years to come, its receipts will be relatively small. We recommendthat the money required should be voted annually by Parliament to the designated Ministry in the form of a grant, unspent money being surrenderedat the end of the year.13. We recommend that responsibility for securing observance of theconditions attached by Parliament to this yearly grant should rest, subjectto the designated Minister, with an Accounting Officer who should be theofficial head of that Ministers Department. There should be no insuperable difficulty about making arrangements to ensure that the Minister and hisAccounting Officer are not required to answer for all the detail of theCorporation^ financial arrangements.14. We should not expect the arrangements for ensuring adequatefinancial control, as normally exercised by Parliament and the Treasury, todiffer widely from the usual departmental pattern for obtaining approvalof the annual estimate and subsequently of individual items of expenditure.It would, however, be essential to ensure that these arrangements give theCorporation freedom to conduct its affairs, including the execution of large capital projects, in a businesslike way. The detailed arrangements shouldbe left for discussion between the Corporation, the designated MinistersDepartment and the Treasury at the appropriate time.15. The Corporation should be allowed rather more flexibility anddiscretion in respect of capital expenditure than is usual with GovernmentDepartments; it should be allowed to proceed, after the annual estimate hasbeen approved, and without further reference to the designated department or the Treasury, with projects up to a higher figure than is permitted to departments.16. Audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General will be appropriate.We presume that in the exercise of his powers the Comptroller and AuditorGeneral would have regard to the special arrangements for delegation offinancial authority to the Corporation.The Corporation17. The Chairman of the Board of the Corporation should discharge the functions of a General Manager. The Board should include four whole-time functional directors : one for engineering and production; one forweapons; one for research and one for administration and finance. Inaddition we recommend the appointment of two part-time members withouta separate technical function.18. Special arrangements will be required in respect of salaries andconditions of service to enable the Corporation to compete with industry formen for all its top level posts; below the top however all reasonable stepsmust be taken to avoid standards widely divergent from those in the CivilService.
L9. Security should be primarily the responsibility of the Corporation;but it should be recognised that the designated Minister may from time totime, or as occasion may require, satisfy himself as to the working of thesecurity arrangements.Transfer problems20. Special consideration should be given to safeguarding, so far aspossible, the interests of existing Civil Servants working in the atomic energyundertakings when responsibility for these is transferred to the Corporation.The following points (on which, however, we do not feel called upon to makeany specific recommendation) were particularly mentioned to us by the TradeUnion side of the Joint Industrial Council and the Staff Side of the Ministryof Supply Administrative Whitley Council: (a) Information on future conditions of service should be made availableto the staff at the earliest possible moment.(b) There should be full and timely consultation on problems arising outof the transfer.(c) The Corporation should recognise the appropriate Unions and staff associations, and make provision for joint consultation betweenemployees and management on the general lines of the Whitley system.(d) Safeguards should be provided for the establishment prospects of thepresent non-established industrials; for the virtual right of temporary staff after seven years&apos; service to a gratuity; and for other conditions ofservice such as the Code of Industrial Travelling rules; transfer rules;paid sick leave; and leave for Trade Union and certain other purposes.(e) Before any new pension scheme, is introduced by the Corporation, itshould be discussed with Staff representatives.(/) Access to Ministers on matters of general importance, at presentenjoyed by staff organisations, should be preserved.(g) An early statement should be made on security of tenure under theCorporation.21. The staff of the atomic energy undertakings should be seconded atthe yes&apos;ting date by the Civil Service to the Corporation for an initial period.During the transitional period, which might have to extend to two years, thestaff would maintain their Civil Service status unimpaired. Before the endof this interim period we should expect the Corporation to offer individualsemployment on Corporation terms, and individuals would have to decide whether to accept those terms or not.22. After the Governments decision to set up a Corporation has beentaken, it will be necessary to draft the necessary legislation and prepare theway for making the Corporation a separate administrative entity. These tasksshould be undertaken by those who will bear responsibility for the Corpora-tion&apos;s successful working. We therefore recommend that when the Governmentannounce their decision to set up a Corporation they should also announce their intention to transfer responsibility at once to the designated Minister.\45042
