(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret. (53) 287 COPY NO.    &apos; -16th OCTOBER, 1953.CABINETDELIMITATION OF TERRITORIAL waters memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland fear I do not agree with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal inC. (53) 277 that we should decide here and now to adhere to our traditionalpolicy in delimiting territorial waters from low-water mark and try to meetScottish inshore fishing interests by conservation measures through thePermanent Overfishing Commission.2. Conservation will not help us in the MIoray Firth and other watersconcerned in Scotland.   Conservation implies that all forms of fishing arerestricted and that in general there is no discrimination between our ownfishermen and those of other countries.   What we want to do is to excludeforeign trawlers from the areas concerned (as our own trawlers are excludedfrom the Moray Firth and Firth of Clyde) and preserve the fisheries in theeconomic interests of our own seine net and line fishermen.   I do not see any hope of securing agreement on conservation grounds to such a measure,3. I am quite willing to try to secure an extension of our exclusivefishery limits by international agreement, and so avoid the necessity of adopting base lines.   But I do not give much for our chances of success;and I think they will be very slender if we first announce our intention ofsticking to our present territorial limits;  we have few concessions which wecan offer other countries in exchange for the rights they now enjoy in the moray Firth and elsewhere,   I do not think therefore we should at this stagedecide against the adoption of base lines.4, If we try negotiations on these lines and fail, I think there would bea very strong case for adopting base lines in accordance with the Hague Courtprinciples for the following reasons:-(a) The economy of the Highlands and Islands and many parts of north-east Scotland depends very largely on inshore fishing.Unemployment in these areas is well above the national average,(b) The present position in the Moray Firth and Firth of Clyde, wherebyour own trawlers are excluded but we cannot exclude foreigntrawlers, is difficult to defend,(c) The Hague Court&apos;s judgment in the Anglo-Norwegian case isregarded in Scotland and by Scottish members as giving clearwarrant for the drawing of base lines,(d) We have had to accept the Norwegian lines and so far have had to,accept the Icelandic lines.   We have no case that will be accepted inScotland for refusing to take similar action.-1-/71j/i
1X55. To sum up, I think we should try to negotiate wider fishery limitsin the Moray Firth and elsewhere/here, indicating that if we fail we shall give further consideration to the adoption of base lines.   It is, perhaps, unnecessary to add that to announce a decision in accordance with the Foreign Secretary&apos;sproposals would be very unpalatable politically to many government supporters in Scotland, including myself.J.S.Scottish Office, S.W.1.16th October, 1953.
