&apos;27(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(53) 294 COPY NO.20TH OCTOBER, 1953CABINETEAST/WEST trade memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeAnnex IV of E, A. (53) 113 contains a disturbing account of the harmwhich is being done to this country!s economic interests by our strategic controls over East/West trade, both in their direct and indirect effects.2.        I accordingly welcome the recommendation in the note by officialsattached to E, A, (53) 114 that a much shorter list of controlled items shouldbe prepared which would be limited to those of undoubted strategic importance, could be adopted by international agreement and would not interfere with trade any more than is necessary to meet the fundamentalrequirements of security.3.        The issues raised by an attempt to reach agreement with the UnitedStates on such a list will of course be extremely delicate,    I think we must assume that agreement will not be reached quickly.    None the less we shallbe under considerable political pressure from both sides of the House ofCommons to show that we are considering the possibilities of relaxation to correspond both with the lowering of the international temperature and the growing belief that many of our controls could not be justified uponstrategic grounds - a view which will, I understand, be reinforced (though this is not yet known to our critics) by a report which is now being preparedby the Joint Intelligence Bureau of the Ministry of Defence.    We shall certainly be under pressure to relax the China Embargo List now that thereis an armistice in Korea.    There are already Parliamentary Questions down,including one by Mr. Wyatt, M. P. on China for Wednesday next,21st October, and another on East/West trade by Mr. Erroll, M, P. for next Thursday, and we must expect that there will be a debate in the House.I think it important, therefore, that we should make some statement aboutEast/West trade so that if, later, relaxations are possible we shall notappear merely to have yielded to pressure from the Opposition.    To letit be thought that we intend to hold rigidly to an indefensible line only tobe driven out of it later by pressure from all sides in this country wouldbe to have the worst of all worlds.    It would weaken our authority at homeand exacerbate any difficulties with the Americans,4.        I have in mind to answer questions on the following lines:-&quot;I welcome this opportunity of making a statement on thesubject of East/West trade.    It is important to see this problem in its right proportions.    Even before the war our total trade withthe Soviet bloc was only about six per cent of our total world trade and since the war it has averaged only about two per cent.
An expansion in East/West trade would, however, undoubtedly be in our economic interests, provided that it was not made atthe expense of the security either of ourselves or of our friends.    The security controls are not inflexible and it isonly sensible to vary them in accordance with the changing circumstances of the strategic situation.    We shall continueto review the controls and, in consultation and agreementwith the other countries who are associated with us in thismatter, we shall introduce such relaxations as may bejustified by changing circumstances. &quot;P.T.Board of Trade, 3. W. 1.19TH OCTOBER, 1953.
