CABINET OFF;,.FiEQORD COPY Copy No.CABINETTHE HOME GUARDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for war on 28th April, 1952, recruiting for the Home Guard was opened. Itsenrolled strength is now 31,870 with a further 25,276 on the reserve roll. Men whojoined the Home Guard took on a liability for two years&apos; service. When this hasbeen completed they will have the choice of extending or finishing. If we wantthem to stay we must stress very strongly the need for keeping on the Home Guard;and of our determination to do so. Unless this is done, it is more than likely thata large number of men will go out, many thinking that war is less likely and that defence policy as a whole suggests a reduction rather than an increase in strength.Indeed, within the next six months there are bound to be indications that reduc-tions in the size and shape of our armed forces have had to be accepted. Whateverreasons we give for these reductions we may well be criticised for reducing the active forces while spending money (about  1 million a year) on the Home Guard,2. On the other hand, the Home Guard has become something of a politicalissue. We have constantly been pressed to abolish it by the Opposition and have repeatedly stressed its importance and our determination to continue with it.Indeed, the Commander-in-Chief Designate, United Kingdom Land Forces, attachesconsiderable importance to the existence in peace of the framework of the home guard upon which can be built up rapidly, preferably during a precautionaryperiod, the necessary force on which he would wish to rely for the defence ofvulnerable points, radar stations, &amp;c, and for military assistance to Civil Defence.3. Against this it may be argued that if and when our overseas commitmentsallow, the number of active formations in this country will increase, thus reducingthe need for a Home Guard. Even so, it will be undesirable to disperse whateverfighting troops may be available on to such scattered tasks as anti-sabotage guardsand coast-watching patrols for which the Home Guard will be admirably suitedif they are available in time.4. I think that this question should be decided during the radical review ofdefence expenditure, but since it is a matter which is likely to have political reper-cussions I do not think that I can myself make an arbitrary decision without consulting my colleagues.I therefore invite the Cabinet to decide whether we should continue with theHome Guard.A.
