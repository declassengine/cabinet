C.(53) 2732ND OCTOBER, 1953lBINETGABMemorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power at their meeting on 23rd July, the Cabinet asked for a further report on coal prospects and various related points that had been raised in discussion (C.C.(53) 45th Conclusions, Minute 7).2. Although colliery performance in the last few weeks has not yetshown the improvement that was expected after the end of the summerholidays, stocks are being built up exceptionally fast and total stocks at thebeginning of this winter should be about 18f million tons, including 1. 2 million tons of house coal.   With stocks at this level it should be possible to meetdomestic and industrial demands during the winter, though, of course, therecan be nothing like certainty about demand, since this largely depends onweather and the general state of industrial activity, or about supplies, since they so largely depend on the efforts of the miners.  A distinct improvement on the present rate of colliery output will be necessary if exports next year are to be maintained at this year&apos;s level.3. I have discussed with Sir Hubert Houldsworth, the Chairman ofthe National Coal Board, the longer-term prospects, and in particular the need to step up capital investment in the industry.   As a result of re-examining thedevelopment plans of each Division, the 1953 figure for colliery investment propel&quot;(which excludes associated activities such as coke ovens) may now prove to be as high as  47 millions, compared with actual expenditure of  38 millions in 1952 and  26. 6 millions in 1951.4. Colliery development is hampered by a shortage of skilled miningengineers.   This will not be fully remedied until the Board&apos;s training schemesbear fruit, but as a short-term measure the Board are making as much use as possible of foreign mining engineers.   For example, they have for sometime been employing at Headquarters a distinguished Dutch mining engineeras their adviser on horiaon mining, which is a Continental technique nowbeing adopted in this country;  and they now have on their staff other foreignmining engineers, iiicluding one who was previously the chief engineer of themechanisation section of the Dutch State Mines.   The Board also make full use of visits abroad by their own technicians, and they have agency arrange^ments in America to keep them in touch with the latest developments there.5. In C. (53) 199 the view was expressed that some furtherdecentralisation from the Headquarters and Divisions of the National coal board would be the right course, and that useful changes would probably be announced in the autumn.   I have discussed the matter further with Sir HubertHouldsworth, and the Board will-, shortly be adopting certain importantproposals.   Their essential feature is the new stress that will be laid on the-1-
responsibility of the Area General Manager.   The Areas are recognised asthe main and vital management units;  the Area General Manager will be infull charge of his Area, and accountable to the Divisional Board as a whole and not to any individual member of it.   He will be brought into regularconsultation by the Divisional Board, who are required to delegate tohim the maximum possible authority in the field of management and toprovide him with adequate staff.   As a necessary complement of theseimmediate changes, the Board are at the same time also appointing acommittee to consider improvement in the existing Area, Divisional and Boardorganisation, and this committee will include two leading industrialists from outside the Board.   These developments of policy have been underconsideration for some time and Sir Hubert Kouldsworth has discussed themfurther with Lord leathers and myself recently.   In our judgment the newdecisions are excellent and this is the right time to introduce them.    Itis important, however, not to arouse the opposition of the National Union of mineworkers to them, and nothing should be said that might convey theimpression that they result from Government pressure,6. Whatever total coal output may prove to be in future years, we still have to face the problem of the shortage of large coal and the need fora sufficient change in the habits of the chief consumers of large coal, railwaysand householdersi to ensure that there is a substantial change-over to othergrades of coal and to other forms of fuel.   Unless we can secure this changewe shall be faced again next year and afterwards with an unpleasant choice between cutting our exports or importing large coal.   Furthermore there willbe no prospect of ending the present irksome restrictions under which the householder is tied down to a particular coal merchant and to limited quantities of coal, under the rationing scheme.7. As explained in the earlier paper, one means of reducing theshortage of large coal is to extend the use by the railways of briquettesmanufactured from small coal.   Until recently the railways were takingthese briquettes at the rate of 250,000 tons a year.   As the result of recent discussions with the Railway Executive, arrangements have already beenmade to increase this supply by an additional 600,000 tons a year, the increase to come from full use of existing briquetting capacity which is at present only partially employed.8. The Coal Board have also at my request been considering thepossibilities of constructing new briquetting plants.   They estimate that if itwere decided to proceed with the construction of such plants and give themhigh priority, it would be possible to increase briquette production by a further700,000 tons in the coal year 1955/56 and by an additional 1 million tons inthe following year.   This would mean that briquettes would be available forconsumption by the railways at an annual rate of 1-Jj million tons in 1955/56rnd 21 million tons in 1956/57.   The Board are going ahead urgently with thepreparation of plans and specifications; they are already experimenting, in existing plant, with the manufacture of briquettes from types of coal not used before for this purpose and supplies have been delivered to the railwaysfor immediate trial.   The Board however are reluctant to take a firm decisionforthwith in favour of this expansion of briquetting capacity.   It wouldinvolve them, they believe, in continuing losses of up to 30/- a ton and capitalexpenditure which might be as high as  2 per ton of annual capacity.9. I think it is reasonable to allow some more time for planning and experiment before a decision is taken about expanding capacity, and wecannot therefore at present estimate how large an economy in their present
S3use of large coal the railways can reasonably be asked to make throughincreased use of briquettes.10. In addition to this saving in the use of large coal by the railways,some 900,000 tons of large coal a year are also now being saved (in comparisonwith the coal year 1952/53) by the substitution of smaller sized coal for use by the railways and other industries.   This annual saving will continue and willbe increased to the largest possible extent.11. Whatever the contribution from the railways may be, it v/ill not by itself be nearly enough for the main purpose.   It is to the 16 million registereddomestic consumers that we must look for any further major economy in large coal.   This is a particularly obstinate problem because the average householderhas a strong ingrained preference for large coal and it v/ill be extremely difficultto persuade him to change his habits.   The most obvious means of persuasionis to offer a price inducement.   This in itself is not a simple proposition asdomestic coal is sold in price groups which are related to quality rather thansize;  but there is a greater proportion of small coal in the lower price groups and a suitable use of the price mechanism therefore can help in solving ourproblem.   With this in mind I authorised early this summer substantial increases in the prices of the better qualities and corresponding reductions in the pricesof the poorer types.   There has hardly been time to judge the results butwe may be able with advantage to take the process further.   Price adjustments of this kind are open to serious objection during the autumn and winter whenmaximum stocks are held by merchants and consumers, but I have underconsideration the possibility of a further instalment of price adjustments to operate from next May,12. We cannot, however, rely on price inducements alone.   We must make sure that the householder has the right type of appliance to burn fuelother than large coal.   My officials have therefore been considering, inconsultation with the Treasury, the possibility of devising a satisfactory schemefor inducing domestic consumers to replace the old-fashioned grates by modernappliances which can burn small coal or coke with reasonable efficiency.   Sincethe war a very considerable number of such appliances has been sold but there hasthis year been an alarming drop in demand despite the very large field forconversion that remains.   Continuous publicity has been given to the advantages of these fires but it seems now that without some special inducement thedemand is unlikely to rise again to a satisfactory level.13. The sale of the more expensive types of grate or stove, costingfrom  18 upwards, would be helped by the easing of credit restriction, as also by encouraging the landlords to install modern appliances under the ImprovedGrant arrangements (this is under discussion with the Ministry of Housing).   Ofthe present production of improved solid fuel appliances, however, 90% consists of simple open fires which are selling at  2. 10.  0 to  6 and which can be easily and quite cheaply installed.   Here the lack of easy payment facilities is clearly not an obstacle to installation, and in my view the only way of inducing the large number of tenants or owner-occupiers to install the appliancesis to offer some positive financial incentive.14. A financial incentive could be afforded in a number of ways and Ibelieve that it would be most effective if it took the form of a free issue of coke or of the sort of coal we want the domestic consumer to take in increasingproportions in the future, on condition that he replaced his old-fashioned grate byan approved appliance.   This would have the double effect of stimulatinginstallation of these grates and of demonstrating to the users that they willburn coke and the less popular coals efficiently.   The free issue would be
part of the consumer&apos;s permitted allowance and would not increase totaldomestic consumption of fuel.   If the inducement is to be effective thescheme would be expensive.   A free issue of a quarter of a ton of coke orcoal, which is what I have in mind, if applied to the full manufacturing capacity of 3 million appliances in a year, might cost as much as  4 millions in asingle year.   (This might make it possible for about 4 million tons of large coal to be replaced each year by small coal, coke or other smokeless fuel and would go a long way towards making the house coal market less selectivein its requirements.)  Clearly a scheme of this importance requires careful investigation of the supply as well as the financial implications and I am notyet ready to make a final proposal to my colleagues.15. As for the industrial use of coal, we have already announced twomeasures which will promote greater efficiency, namely, the extendedGovernment loan scheme and the Governments intention of handing overexecutive functions relating to industrial fuel efficiency to a non-profit-makingCompany, sponsored by the British Productivity Council, who will be able todo the work on a greater scale.   The British Productivity Council have made good progress with the establishment of the Board of the new Company, andI hope to be able to announce the names of the Chairman-and Board of Directorsas soon as the House reassembles.   The contribution that the Company can make to the large coal problem may not be great, but there can be no doubtthat there are great economies to be gained in the industrial use of other types of coal.16. The Minister of Agriculture, the Secretary of State for Scotlandand I have not yet completed our consultation about the forward plan foropencast mining which the Cabinet have asked us to concert.17. To sum up, under the policy outlined above we aim at the followingresults by the end of 1955:-(a) more economical use of fuel by industry in general;(b) the use of briquettes by the railways at a substantially increased annual rate;(c) a greatly increased number of domestic consumers withimproved grates able to burn small coal or coke or othersmokeless fuel;(d) coal exports at least at the 1953 level.18. I am of course determined to abandon the present restrictions on house coal at the earliest possible date, with a saving of staff of some 4,000costing over  1 million a year, and to do this without either cutting exportsor importing coal.   1st May, 1955 is the date I have in mind, but at present :- can make no promise that derestriction will be possible then without somehelp from foreign coal.G.L...Ministry of Fuel and Power, 5.W.I.2nd October, 1953.
