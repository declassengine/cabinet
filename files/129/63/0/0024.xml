8SSSECRETC. (53) 2743rd OCTOBER, 1953..OPY NO.^ 1CABINETTELEVISION development memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in accordance with the instructions of the Cabinet on 16th September(C.C.(53) 52nd Conclusions, ivlinute 4) the Committee of Ministers on television development has considered the question of television policy further.   We have examined many schemes, in order to find the one likely to command the largestmeasure of support among the many interests concerned.2.ways:Competitive television could be introduced in one of the following(1) One or more privately financed concerns   licensed by thePostmaster-General.(2) A public corporation established with public money, its operations being financed wholly by revenue from receiverlicences.(3) A public corporation established with public money, its operations being financed wholly by advertisements.-(4) A public corporation established with public money, its operations being financed partly from advertisements andpartly from receiver licences.In cases (1) - (4) above the concern or corporation would own and operate the transmitters and would also manage the programmes.... ...(5) A. public corporation established with public money owningthe transmitters and equipment, would lease them toprivately financed operating companies to provide the programmes; the private companies would obtain their income from advertisers.(6) A corporation, privately financed, whose operations (including itsdividends) would be controlled in the same way as a public utilitycompany, licensed by the Postmaster-General to own transmitters;it would lease them to privately financed operating companies whov/ould obtain their income from advertisers.(7) A corporation, with Government directors but established by private finance, to own the transmitters;  it would lease them toprivately financed operating companies obtaining their income fromadvertisers.   (This scheme is virtually the same as (6), exceptthat the board of Government directors would itself control standards and there would be no need for a separate supervisory body.)
3. My colleagues may find it convenient to consider these variedschemes with the following main considerations in mind:&quot;(a) Does the scheme involve legislation?(b) Does the scheme involve the use of public funds?(c) What is the nature and effectiveness of the control it provides onstandards ?(d) Will it make easier the problem of selecting applicants?Legislation4, Any scheme which does not involve legislation must be preferable.It would be distasteful and difficult to have to force a bill on this subject throughboth Houses; and it is doubtful in what shape it would emerge.Public or private finance5. From the point of view of the Exchequer, there are strong objections to the use of public money.   It may well be right (subject to adequate control) to allow private investors to risk their money in setting up a competitive system of television;  it does not follow that we should be justifiedin using public money for this purpose.   The demand for an alternative system is individual rather than general, and any new programme would compete for broadcasting material against the British Broadcasting Corporation - whichis itself financed (through receiving licence fees) from Government revenue.6. There would in any case be the strongest political objection to schemes (Z) and (4), which, depend wholly or partly on revenue from receiverlicence fees.   It will not be physically possible for three or four years toprovide an alternative programme on a coveage as wide as that provided by thepresent television service.   Schemes (2) and (4) would therefore mean collectingan increased licence fee - perhaps as much as  5 - in some cases from peopleunable to receive the second programme,7. In schemes (3) and (5) the public money invested would be entirelyat risk;  in the former case, the risk would be that the corporation^ operations would not succeed in attracting sufficiently remunerative advertisements, andin the latter case, private operators might be disappointed in their hopes ofmaking a profit and might give up their leases, or be deprived of them and noother acceptable lessees found.Control of standards3. Standards of taste can best be ensured by direct management by apublic corporation or a board of Government directors.   Otherwise, the soleultimate sanction is the withdrawal of the licence.   The more flexible the meansof pressure, and the smaller the vested interest of the operator of the programmes, the more effective the control.   It would be easier to modify or torefuse to renew a lease of a station than to rescind the licence of a company which has invested large sums in fixed assets which would be hard to sell.   Ascheme in which one concern would own the station, but would lease it to adifferent concern to operate the programmes would therefore be preferable  fromthe point of view of control.   But unless the concern owning the station had aboard of Government directors, standards, would have to be safeguarded by acontrolling body, and this, even to appear effective, would need to besupervisory and not merely advisory.
9. For technical reasons, there can be only one additional television programme with national coverage during the next few years.   This channel couldbe available for more than one local low-powered service, but it is clear that even if, say, three separate companies were allowed to provide competitivetelevision, it would be difficult for all of them to provide programmes of adequate quality and that a close link between them would be inevitable - indeed,in the interests of a good service, it might well be desirable.   To selectperhaps a single company, or at most a very few companies who are in any caselikely to link up, from all the applicants, may be difficult, though it should bepossible to do it by some kind of competitive tender.10. This difficulty would be most awkward if we were to adopt scheme(1) - that is, to licence a private company or companies to own the stations andmanage the programme, since the Postmaster-General himself would have to select the concessionaire, doubtless with the help of an advisory committee.It would be less awkward if a public corporation or a public utility company had to lease its stations to private concerns (as in schemes (5), (6) and (7)),since the Government would not be directly responsible.7/hich scheme would command most support (or arouse least opposition!) ?11. There are difficulties in any of the schemes in paragraph Z above which we cannot avoid unless we drop the idea of bringing competition intotelevision.We are really left with only four possibilities:-A. One or more private companies, licensed by the Postmaster-General, owning the stations and managing the programmes ondefined conditions.   If the conditions were broken, the licencescould be withdrawn;  but this is not a very flexible or efficientmeans.B. A &quot;public utility&quot; type corporation, financed by privatemoney on debenture, but with all the directors appointed by theGovernment, which would own the stations, and lease them to private companies who would manage the programmes and derive theirrevenue from advertisements.   The control of standards would bein the hands of the corporation, which could keep in constant touchwith the companies and, in the last resort, threaten to modify, torefuse to renew, or to rescind their leases.G.   A public corporation, financed by the Exchequer, to own the stations and lease them to private operating companies, as in B.D.   To do nothing.   But we are committed in principle, both bythe White Paper (Gmd. 8550) and the statements made inParliament on 2nd July this year, to allowing some element of competition in television.   To decide to postpone doing so, evenon the technical grounds that for some time there can only be onecompetitive television programme with national coverage, would cause concern and disappointment to many of our supporters.12.       There is much to be said for alternative A.   It is simple, in line with our philosophy and would please many of our supporters.   But we must recognise that it will not allay the widely held apprehensions which were expressed in the summer.   Against the difficulty of selecting one or moreapplicants for licences, this scheme has the merit that no legislation is needed
13.       Now for scheme 3.   The concept of a corporation with public functionsof control, but established by private money, is unusual.   It is most unlikelythat the corporation could raise money by ordinary public subscription.   Butif it provided the only means of introducing competitive television, the amountneeded for this purpose might well be subscribed, either by those who are anxious to put their money into profit-making television programme companies,or by companies which have an interest in the production of television equipment.As the Directors of the corporation will be appointed by the Government,this limitation of the field of subscriptions would be immaterial:  but it mightwell lead to conflicts of interest if at any time the subscribers were in a positionto influence the appointment or decisions of the Directors.The capital required would be between  500,000 and  1 million;  itshould bear only a fixed rate of interest and any surplus of income overinterest, working expenses, depreciation, obsolescence, etc. should be ploughedback*into the business.The scheme is one that has the advantage of being possible without legislation.   It also has this advantage - that we shall have made an offerproviding for the control of standards, and that if the private investor doesnot subscribe we can do no more.14,        The capital required to set up the public corporation under scheme Cwould be about the same as for scheme 3,   In addition to the strong objectionsagainst sinking Government money in a highly speculative undertaking&quot;&quot;which will itself compete with the B.3.C., this scheme has the disadvantage ofrequiring legislation.   Its sole advantage is that the absolute purity ofGovernment control is ensured by providing public finance.15.       All these courses are difficult.   The solution we had in mind inthe summer was in essence Scheme A, but we then intended to exclude Religionand Politics.   To avoid giving a monopoly in this field to the 3.3.C., our own supporters want us not to exclude Religion and Politics.   In any event, effective control could only be provided either by a statutory controlling body (whichwould involve legislation), or by the Postmaster-General taking direct responsibility (which would put him in a difficult and perhaps impossible position).If we set up a public corporation to do the job the alternatives are either  to put in public money and to run the gauntlet of legislation;   or to adoptthe compromise solution of a privately financed public board, which may find difficulty in attracting investment, will be misrepresented and in the view of thePostmaster-General would probably not (in the absence of legislation) enable him to disclaim direct responsibility for programmes to Parliament.R.A.3.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.End October, 1953.
