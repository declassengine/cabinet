Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1953SECRET Copy No.C. (53) 27715th October, 1953CABINETDELIMITATION OF TERRITORIAL waters memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in C. (53) 2 I undertook to bring the question of the. method of delimitingterritorial waters before my colleagues as soon as the results of discussions to beheld with the Americans on this subject were known. These discussions were delayedby the change of Administration in the U.S.A. in January and by the protracteddebate in Congress over ownership of the oil-bearing tidelands.2. During the conversations which subsequently took place in the first partof August between the Foreign Office Legal Adviser and an Assistant Legal Adviserof the State Department, it was ascertained that the United States government intended to adhere to the established method of delimiting the width of territorial waters from the low water mark and that they would prefer Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to do likewise.3. I have now reached the conclusion that, in view of our own strategic andmaritime interests and of the attitude of the United States Government, the balanceof advantage to Her Majesty&apos;s Government lies in the maintenance of our tradi-tional method of delimiting territorial waters and that it would be undesirable for us to adopt the new base-line method even when consideration of local interests would indicate such a solution.4. Moreover, approval by my colleagues of our continued adherence to theold method would strengthen our case for placing a strict interpretation on theprinciples approved by The Hague Court and would enable us to protest firmlyto countries who adopt base-lines which, in our view, depart from those principles.We should thereby remain in the best attainable position to safeguard the Britishdeep-sea fishing fleets, which catch far the greater part of our fish and are animportant naval reserve, from further annexation of fishing grounds by foreigncountries. We should admittedly be precluded from using the delimitation of territorial waters by base-lines to solve the inshore fishing problems of Scotlandand of some colonies. Nevertheless I consider that these interests are outweighed by the importance of maintaining, in accordance with our traditional policy, theprinciple of freedom of the high seas, so vital to a great naval and maritime Power.5. Scottish inshore fishing interests might still be assisted in such areas asthe Moray Firth if we could develop the idea of applying special conservationmeasures to such waters through the international fishing conservation bodies which have grown up in recent years. A Permanent Commission under an Inter-national Fisheries Convention of 1946 has recently been set up to cover the waters of the coasts of northern and western Europe, including the British Isles, andwe are endeavouring to ensure that its mandate, the scope of which is at presentin doubt, will include, inter alia, the special protection of particular Waters on grounds of conservation.45014
6. If my colleagues agree that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should adhere tothe present method of delimiting territorial waters, a public statement should bemade at some stage to the effect that no change of policy in favour of the newbase-line method is under consideration. I consider that this could best be donein reply to a Parliamentary Question. Moreover if this decision is taken i recommend that we should do all we can to influence world opinion in favour of resisting encroachments on the high seas, in concert with the United States andother Powers who share our views. Our efforts to do this would be badlyhampered unless our intentions were announced unequivocally.7. The recommendation which I have made above is supported by theMinister of Defence, the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries and the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation.8.   I therefore ask my colleagues to agree:(a) that no change be made by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the methodsused to delimit territorial waters in the United Kingdom and theColonies, and(b) that every effort now be made to rally international opinion to our pointof view.A.
