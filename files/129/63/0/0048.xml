Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1953SECRETC. (53) 29823rd October, 1953CABINETDECONTROL OF MEAT AND BACON: FUTURE MARKETINGARRANGEMENTSMemorandum by the Minister of FoodA policy to carry out the guarantee to producersFrom discussion with my colleagues in the Food and Agriculture CommitteeI had hoped that we had found agreement on the policy to be recommended.That policy was: a restoration of private trade in livestock and meat, thus dis-charging our pledge to the trades that they should have their businesses back atthe end of the control period; changes in the pre-war system designed to improve,but not discourage, free markets; a guarantee to the farmers in the form of deficiency payments, but buttressed by an additional guarantee to the individualproducer, explained in the appendix to this paper, to protect him against anyspecial hazards of mischance or malpractice.2. I am fully determined that we should give, and be seen to give, to the farmer the guarantee to which he is entitled; that is why despite the administrative and financial complications which it introduces I would be prepared to go so faras to accept the additional guarantee of a &quot; buttress price.&quot; The Minister ofAgriculture agrees that these proposals could be defended as a fair method ofhonouring our obligations under Part One of the Agriculture Act of 1947. the combination of an individual with a collective guarantee would also meet what isjustifiable in the claim of the National Farmers Unions that the individual shouldnot be left exposed to the vagaries of the market.Legitimate scope for a Marketing board. The arrangement I would support would leave producers free to promote a Producers&apos; Marketing Board, although not one with monopolistic trading powers.Such a Board could develop marketing on a grade and dead-weight basis. Itcould play an important part in the marketing of pigs intended for bacon curing.I would like to see this Board take a hand in improving the efficiency of our pig industry, whose costs compare unfavourably with what we pay.in Denmark. Itcould, with this in view, be made responsible for paying, from Exchequer funds,a quality premium on high grade bacon pigs of the kind which my department is now beginning to pay and this premium could at the Board&apos;s discretion be variedfrom time to time so as to maintain a reasonable balance with the seasonalattraction of the pork market.A policy for stability with freedom4. Such a policy would provide the stability to which the farmers are entitled under the Agriculture Act and also give scope to enterprise and efficiency. It should go a long way towards satisfying the farmers&apos; aspirations for a Producers&apos; Market-ing Board and give such a Board a fair chance to show what it could do over theyears without the introduction of undue compulsion. The Board&apos;s activities should45056Copy No.      73
add to healthy competition in the trade and besides being of advantage to the producer would contribute towards a flourishing and efficient livestock industry.This is just the sort of evolutionary process which has always served us best inthe end.The Minister of Agricultures proposal5. No doubt, after fourteen years of complete control and fixed prices,farmers will need a little time to get used to a freer system. Moreover, I appreciate that the ambitions of the National Farmers Unions for a monopoly will not besatisfied. The Minister of Agriculture is naturally concerned at the hostility withwhich he expects these proposals to be received and wishes us to go further inorder to avoid a clash with the Unions. The alternative which he proposes would commit us once and for all to the principle of a Marketing Board with monopolytrading powers with, in addition, an interim period of State trading by the Ministryof Food. Even if the use of these powers were limited in the first instance (e.g., topigs), it is clear that from the beginning the Board would bear the stamp of theultimate ambition of its proponents to become the sole supplier of fresh meat.Under it, producers would get fixed prices and would, thus,, be insulated from thecompetition which, subject to the protection of the Agriculture Act guarantees, weshould wish producers as well as distributors to experience. We should have toput the resources of Government financial, legislative and administrative behind the establishment of this authoritarian system; and while this formidablestructure was being completed the Ministry of Food would have to continue totrade.I, for my part, am gravely disturbed by the possibility of a clash with the manytrade interests involved, whose contacts with the public spread to every home inthe land.No precise term to Ministry trading6. I view with great concern the prospect of my Department embarking forthe first time on this new experiment of commercial trading on the market in a commodity which hitherto traders have been compelled to take irrespective of quality and type at controlled prices. The Minister of Agriculture has tried tomeet me by proposing that a definite date should be fixed by which a Producers&apos;Marketing Board would take over. But no precise term can be set to the Ministryof Food&apos;s responsibility, since it is neither proper constitutionally nor possible inpractice to guarantee that a Producers&apos; Marketing Board would be in existence bya particular date or even at all. The procedure under the Agricultural MarketingActs requires a public enquiry, a judicial appraisal of its results by the Minister ofAgriculture, a two-thirds vote of producers and approval by Parliament. Neitherthe timing nor the results of these steps can be determined in advance. If, in theend, the result was unfavourable, many months would still be necessary to prepare a new scheme, and it would therefore be wrong to think that, if there were noBoard in existence by the due date, an alternative arrangement could be speedilyput into operation.Other difficulties finance, and enforcement7. It is also suggested that a limit be set to the Exchequer liability. But Iam bound to say that the proposal does not seem to me to provide a sound basis for the financial arrangements with the Board. There is a trading loss on home-killed meat now, under control, of well over  50 millions a year. But in theconditions in which my Department would be operating as a single seller of live-stock in a free buyer&apos;s market during the assumed interim period of 12 monthsthat loss could be much greater. The trades will be bitterly opposed to thescheme and we cannot expect them to come to our assistance in reducing theGovernment&apos;s trading losses. And farmers would have little inducement to help us do so when they know that the greater this loss, the greater the loss which the marketing Board could incur with impunity during the first year of its existence.Nor is there any inherent probability that the Exchequer loss, thereafter, wouldbe substantially or speedily reduced. We should have to rely on the negotiationonce a year of lower prices to the producer if the Board had made larger tradinglosses; and we know in advance that there would be strong resistance to such areduction.
&amp;*. My Department would be in a very weak position during the indefinite period when it was acting as a single seller of livestock. There would be a strongtemptation for producers to make sales direct to the trade whenever the market was strong, and leave my Ministry &quot; to hold the baby &quot; when the market was weak.I would be bound to recruit and maintain an army of Enforcement Inspectors to police these arrangements.Continued Rationing9. There is, of course, another alternative, and that is that we should try togo on as we are now rationing the consumer, allocating supplies and controllingprices at every stage. But, as far as I can foresee, we shall not be able to point to shortage of supplies as the reason for rationing next summer; and even ifwe wanted to maintain control for lack of an alternative marketing system, to judge by our experience this year the pressure to abandon it may be irresistible.Moreover, the country would find it difficult to accept that we were maintaining the apparatus of control for fatstock and meat for no other reason than that wecould not introduce another method for guaranteeing the farmer.Central trading in meat and livestock peculiar difficulties10. Fresh meat is one of the most perishable of all foods; and livestock,once in the possession of a central buyer, loses value very rapidly. Moreover, whileduring the control system we have perforce been working on the principle that &quot; the ration is the ration &quot; entitling the consumer to no choice of kind or cut, there isin fact a wide range of varieties of meat. Once the supply is satisfactory, consumerchoice will quickly express itself in a complex and ever-changing pattern of local and individual preferences. In these conditions a single seller receiving his supplies at pre-determined fixed prices is undertaking a task so hazardous that he couldnot afford, even if he were physically able to do so, to give consumer choice theconsideration it deserves. Under a free system decisions and risks are spread overmany thousands of individuals, every one of whom depends for his livelihood onsatisfying his customers. But under the system proposed a central seller, with:little power to influence type, location and timing of supplies, interposed between,the producer and distributor-the individual trader&apos;s attempts to reflect consumerchoice could not succeed.11. I must say plainly that my Department, if it were to retain the wholeapparatus of control with its network of local boards and committees necessaryto handle the animals, and were given a free hand in recruiting extra staff, couldnot trade efficiently as a central seller. To protect public funds as best we could in these circumstances we should have to make ruthless use of our monopolisticposition which would involve continued bulk buying and control of the imported meat trade in order to eliminate one important form of competition. In short, wecould show no scruple about keeping the consumer short when necessary to force (a) reasonable price from the market. The deliberate creation of the scarcity which alone allows any central organisation (whether Board or Government Department)to trade effectively in meat is a political impossibility. However tempting it mightbe to think of the Ministry of Food as a temporary bulwark between the farmers and the market to avoid a difficult decision, I cannot recommend this expedient.12. All these criticisms apply to any form of monopoly trading in this com-commodity whether it be by a Government Department or by a Producers&apos; MarketingBoard. Indeed, any such scheme could well be a long step towards nationalisation.It would be inconsistent with the conditions of a freer economy which is the aim off our economic policy.G. LL.-G.Ministry of Food, S.W. 1,22nd October, 1953.
ISAThe Government would cease to purchase fatstock and all sections of the trade,including importers, would be allowed to resume their business activities. Eachproducer would sell his livestock to the trade by the method which he prefers by auction or private treaty, by liveweight or.b^ deadweight.2.   The guarantee under the Agriculture Act would take the form of:  (i) a standard price guaranteed to producers collectively by means of deficiency payments;(ii) a &quot; buttress &quot; price guaranteed to individual producers.Under this system the producer has every incentive to get all he can out of themarket, but under (i), if in any period the average realised price fell below thestandard price, every producer would be paid the difference in the form of a uniform sum by weight for each of the guaranteed classes of livestock sold by him.This uniform payment would thus represent the average deficiency for the industry as a whole, but would have no direct relation to the price obtained by an individualproducer in the market.In addition, under (ii), each producer who sold guaranteed fatstock below the&quot; buttress &quot; price (which would be lower than the standard price) would have thedifference between that price and his actual sale price made up to him individually.The livestock industry as a whole would thus be assured that the averagemarket price would, if necessary, be supplemented so as to maintain a reasonablelevel of return. But, in addition, the individual producer would be insured againstthe risk that particular sales might, whether through mischance or malpractice, bedepressed unduly below the market level.3. The following arrangements for the promotion of efficient marketing wouldbe made:  (a) The pre-war auction system would be improved as follows:  (i) To assist orderly marketing, a system of prior notification toauctioneers of fatstock entries would be made compulsory.(ii) Some concentration of supplies would be effected by closing downunsatisfactory markets.(iii) Marketing intelligence would be brought more effectively to thenotice of producers.(iv) Bidding by weight instead of by the head would be made compulsoryat auction sales.(b) Producers would be encouraged to promote a producers&apos; marketing scheme under which a Fatstock Marketing Board would (i) buy and sell fat-stock (other than bacon pigs) by grade and deadweight so far as facilitiesallowed; (ii) regulate the sale of bacon pigs to bacon factories on a contract system providing for purchase by grade and deadweight;:(iii) administer a premium system for high-grade bacon pigs.appendix the Two-Fold Guarantee
