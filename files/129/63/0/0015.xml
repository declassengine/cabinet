Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1953SECRET. -   v -C. (53) -265&apos;&apos; - ilECC29th September, 1953 .cabinet general AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE: EIGHTH session memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeG.A.T.T.It may be convenient if I give my colleagues a short report on the state ofplay at the present Session of the Contracting Parties to the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.).2. During the first week which covered the general debate on the G.A.TT.and the opening discussion upon a number of important topics I led the british delegation. Most of the subjects then debated are now under consideration by working parties of officials and final discussions have not therefore been made upon them.General3. The most important fact that emerged from the general Debate was thegeneral support for a Review of the provisions of the General Agreement. I didhowever strongly emphasise, and the view was generally accepted, that such a review would be premature and indeed fruitless this side of a decision by theUnited States on her Commercial Policy. It appears likely that the ContractingParties will be wishing to have.an examination of some of the basic provisionsof the G.A.T.T. in about a year or eighteen months from now.Continuation of Existing Tariff Concessions4. There was general support for the proposal, sponsored by the United Statesleader (Mr. Samuel Waugh) and myself, that the existing time-bar for the re-negotiation of tariff concessions negotiated at the various tariff conferences of theG.A.T.T. should be extended until the end of 1954 or the summer of .1955. but some countries, including Australia and New Zealand, are anxious to reserve someminimum facility to deal with any special cases that may arise, and the questionis now under technical examination by a Working Party of officials. I have little doubt that a satisfactory formula will be agreed. As I explained to the cabinet before leaving, this may embarrass us in some items now the subject of tariffapplications, but will preserve our tariff concessions in the United States and otherimport markets.  (C.C. (53) 50th Conclusions, Minute 8.)Waiver Application5. I presented our application for a waiver of the no-new-preferenee ruleon unbound items strongly, both in full session and at informal meetings withparticular Ministers and officials, and I think that the difficulties of our positionand the limited scope of our proposed solution are generally understood andappreciated. But I must warn my colleagues that there is no assurance yet thatwe shall secure in full the general waiver for which we are asking. At the first-reading debate the European speakers were all critical of our proposal and therewas no support from countries, such as Brazil and Indonesia, which have no materialinterest to oppose us. On the other hand, Commonwealth countries, notably India44929OFhiCE:vh&apos; copy copy No.  66
and Ceylon, supported us with good sense and tact and Mr. Waugh made a shortbut impressive and incisive speech on our side.. The question has been referredto a Working Party under Belgian Chairmanship (Baron Suetens, who was thefirst Chairman of the G.A.T.T. six years ago) and it may be some two or three weeksyet before a report is agreed.:: 6. 1 do not think anyone cares or at any rate cares very much about thetechnical breach involved in the no-new-preference rule. The basic difficulty is this. Nobody could really challenge our right to raise tariffs on the unbound-items to which alone the waiver relates. But the fact is that, by what appears. to havebeen an oversight by the previous Government, we are placed in the unique posi-tion of being the only country unable to do so owing to the technical operation ofthe no-new-preference rule. European Governments not unnaturally feelreluctant to release us from this trap. Some, too, are probably afraid that, if theyvote for a waiver, they will be accused by their constituents of letting us raisetariffs to protect our industries against their exports.7. In the circumstances I thought it best to hold a small meeting with theprincipal European delegates before I left Geneva and to underline to them thatin this field of unbound duties we are determined, in any event, to ensure thatindustries which need additional protection shall in one way or another receive it;that the purpose of the waiver is to enable us to give that protection in the formof an increased tariff, which is the form least likely to injure our European friends;but that, if the waiver is refused, we shall see that the protection is provided whether by promoting new tariff legislation or by maintaining import restrictions.I made it quite clear that where we have a right to protect our industries, that is tosay where we have entered into no commitment to bind our tariff, we shall do soat our own discretion; and that there is, in fact, no question of stopping us, by refusing the waiver we need if we are to do this in the most sensible way from thepoint of view of all concerned. I hope this meeting may have made some impres-sion. This is an important issue both politically and commercially. We cannotdefend a situation in which we are the only nation unable to raise our unboundtariff rate. So long as that situation persists we are presenting ammunition to thosewho argue for high protection and wish to attack the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade. I will keep my colleagues in touch with how this situation develops atGeneva.Japan8. I saw the Japanese Ambassador, who is leading the Japanese delegation at the conference, the first morning after my arrival in Geneva. He put to mehis anxiety to have United Kingdom support for his Governments application forprovisional association with the G.A.T.T., and I thought it best to tell him frankly,there and then, why I could not support him and why I doubted whether it was inthe best interests of Japan to pursue the application at this stage. Mr. Matsumototook this quite well and I should say that our personal relations (I included him in a small dinner party I gave for Ministers) remained good throughout. At thefirst-reading debate he put his ease moderately and well and Mr. Samuel Waughand others gave him good support. I led the opposition, and I was supported by australia, New Zealand and France. I think that the Japanese would have beenvery surprised if we had supported them.9. I was told by the French delegate, on the evening before the debate, thatthe Americans had put the very strongest diplomatic pressure upon them and others to come into line, and I suspect that the Japanese would not muster the necessary two-thirds majority if a free vote could be taken; I know that the Dutch andparticularly the Belgians see the force in our point of view. The question hasbeen referred to a Working Party. It is almost certain that the Japanese will getaccession in some form or another, but it may be more narrowly restricted than their own proposal, and we shall certainly not be the only country standing out from any obligations which may be undertaken.P. T.Board of Trade, S.W.1, &apos;.29th September, 1953.
