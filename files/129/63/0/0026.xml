Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1953SECRET Copy No.? 2C (53) 276 ^9th October, 1953CABINETWAGES AND prices memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service in his memorandum on Food Subsidies C. (53) 271 the Minister of Food givesan estimate of the rate at which the subsidies are running and of the possible measures to increase prices which would be necessary to save some  35 millions inthe current financial year and thus keep the total subsidies close to the ceiling of 220 millions. The effect on the general index of retail prices would be to raisethe index by just over 2 points; the food index would be raised by 4 points.2. In my memorandum E.A. (53) 34 of 24th February, I stressed the fact thatwage stability could not be maintained in the face of a continued rise in prices of basic goods and services and that any rise in food prices was particularly badbecause of its psychological effect on the housewife.3. At the Annual Conference of the Trades Union Congress in september the argument for increased wages was based almost entirely on the increase in food prices and it is quite clear that responsible trade union leaders will be forced topress claims for higher wages so long as food prices rise.4. The increase in the Retail Prices Index has been slowed down this yearcompared with the two previous years. If no further measures to raise prices are taken the increase this year looks like being 3 points compared with 8 pointslast year and 14 points in 1951. But this progress towards stabilisation has not brought the maximum benefit in wage restraint because in the first half of theyear the Food Index went up by A\ points. Although the Food Index has sincegone down by 2 points it was this earlier increase in food prices that was the maincause of claims for increased wages being made in a number of our important industries engineering, shipbuilding, dock labour, railways, building as well asin most of the industries covered by wages councils. It is not possible to say whatthe outcome is likely to be but in view of the example set by agriculture-an increaseof Is. a week and the increases granted in many of our smaller industries it looksas if some increase is in any case inevitable in our major industries.5. To increase the price of butter, beef, cheese and bread would be boundto give a strong additional impetus to current wage claims and might well giverise to renewed claims in those industries where settlements have recently beenreached. In particular an immediate increase of 33^- per cent, in the price of breadjust at the time when major claims are entering on a crucial phase would in myopinion be most unwise. It is not possible to say what these claims would cost,but mv colleagues should know that the average annual increase in the total wage and salary bill of the country in the last 3 years has amounted to about  580millions.6. I do not however merely suggest that on tactical grounds there should bea postponement of measures to increase food prices. If basic wages (as distinct from earnings) are to be kent stable, prices, and particularly food prices, must bekept steady. I consider that on both economic and political grounds (for we arepledged to reduce the cost of living) our policies should be directed towardsstabilising and if possible reducing prices and in particular the prices of the mainfoodstuffs.W. M.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W.1,8th October, 1953.44988
