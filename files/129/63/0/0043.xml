(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC-MA JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(53) 293 COPY NO.19th OCTOBER. 1953.CABINETJAPAN AND THE GENERAL AGREEMENT on tariffs AND trade memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI must trouble my colleagues once again with this subject, whichcould cause serious political difficulties at home.2. As authorised by the Cabinet I stated at Geneva that we could not support Japan&apos;s application for provisional association with the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) and that we should abstain on a formal vote,   I was supported by Australia and New Zealand, and a number ofother countries also will probably abstain.   This is the policy our publichere now expects from us.3. As I reported to my colleagues in C.(53) 265, a compromise proposal was made under which Japan would attend meetings of the  G.A.T.T.but would have the rights and obligations of the G.A.T.T.  only in regard tothose countries which signed a protocol to that effect.   The Cabinet authorisedme to seek a settlement along these lines, subject to certain conditions asregards the contents of the formal Resolution and provided that Australiaand New Zealand were also willing to contemplate such a proposal(C.C.(53) 55th Conclusions, Minute 9).4. The position now is that New Zealand is willing to join us in seeking an acceptable Resolution along these lines, but she is not keen on itand she is very doubtful about agreeing to give Japan any kind of voting rights in the G.A.T.T, Australia, however, will not support any proposal which admitsJapan either as provisional member or as observer.5. It was never likely that we should have obtained all the conditions we wanted (and proposed to Australia and New Zealand).   But now, even if wesucceeded in securing a Resolution in the form and with the conditions Iindicated, we should be faced with the fact that Australia considered theResolution unacceptable.   Every argument that Mr. Menzies used in Canberrato justify the independent line he took would be an argument against us for having voted for the Resolution,   Indeed, to take a different attitude from australia&apos;s would be regarded by the public here as an act in favour of Japan and against Australia, and as a retreat from the firm and clear statement which we made at the outset.6. I attach the greatest importance to sticking by those who stick with us.   It was indeed explicit in our telegrams to Mr. Menzies and Mr. Hollandthat if we agreed to consider the compromise we should stick together ininsisting upon the conditions we proposed.   I ask my colleagues therefore to agrethat we should join with Australia and New Zealand in rejecting the compromise proposal outlined in paragraph 3,P.TBoard of Trade, S.W.1.19th October, 1953.
