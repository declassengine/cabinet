Printed for the Cabinet.  September 1953SECRET CABINET OPE   , ... Copy No.     C&quot; RECORD copy . (53) 26428th September, 1953CABINETWHITE PAPER ON HOUSING policy memorandum by the Lord Privy seal the Committee on Housing Policy has considered the points raised in discussion in Cabinet and proposes the attached amendments to the White paper on Housing.2. The redraft and consequential shortening of paragraphs 38 to 40 is designedto give effect to the proposal that any reference in the White Paper to the condition that the landlord must show that he has spent money on repairs before he can get any repairs increase should be in general terms and that the detailed provisions should be left to the Bill. This incidentially will have the advantage of helping to concentrate the discussions on the White Paper on main principles and notdetails.3. The addition which it is desired to make to paragraph 43 was explained to the Cabinet by the Minister of Housing, although not mentioned in the cabinet minutes.  He feels sure that this proposal is right and logical.4. The redraft of paragraph 49 and the new paragraphs headed &quot; The new policy and the building industry &quot; (to go in towards the end of the White Paper,with consequential amendments to paragraphs 89 and 90) are proposed to meetthe views of the Minister of Works.5. Paragraph 91 contains in the second sentence a warning that the existing rates of subsidy cannot continue indefinitely at their present high level. TheChancellor of the Exchequer in Cabinet expressed the hope that some referencecould be made to the rents of local authority houses; his point being that if thesedid not go up, it would be difficult to avoid keeping housing subsidies at theirpresent level. The Minister of Housing appreciates this point but thinks that itwould be better to confine what is said in the White Paper to the general warningcontained in the sentence as drafted. There is quite enough trouble coming alonganyhow.6. The Secretary of State for Scotland in his paper C. (53) 251 referred tosome apparent differences between the proposals for England and Scotland aboutthe measures for dealing with the unfit and dilapidated houses. They are mattersof emphasis rather than principle and do not affect the presentation of the subject in paragraphs 50-62 of the White Paper. They are being discussed inter-departmentally and it is hoped will be cleared up by these means.H. C.Gwydyr House, S.W. 1,28th September, 1953.44908
Amendments to Draft White Paper on HousingParagraphs 38, 39, 40.-To be telescoped to read: &quot;Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment intend that a landlord will be permitted to claim a repairs increase only if thehouse is in a good general state of repair, and the proposed legislation will contain the necessary provisions to see that the repairs have been or are being done tosecure compliance with this condition.&quot;Paragraph 43. Add at end: &quot; Houses which are owned by such non-profitmaking bodies as housing associations and New Town Corporations will be freed from control and so put into the same category as houses owned by localauthorities.&quot;After paragraph 47 insert as heading &quot; Programmes &quot; (paragraph 48 as in thedraft White Paper).Paragraph 49. Substitute new paragraph 49 to read, &quot; In the original slum clearance campaign of 1931, each local authority was required to submit a pro-gramme to the Minister. This programme showed the number of houses proposedto be demolished, the proposals for replacing them by new houses and the estimatedrate of progress. The Government propose to follow this precedent. The Minister&apos;sfunction in examining these programmes will be to consider on the one handwhether they are adequate, and on the other their impact on the total resourcesof money, labour and materials available for all housing purposes after the claims of other essential building work have been considered.&quot;New paragraphs to be headed, &quot; The New Policy and the Building Industry.&quot;The demands for houses and flats will never be entirely satisfied. Old buildingsdecay. New ones must take their place. The population increases and the stock of houses must increase too. Moreover, in a progressive society the standards of housing are continually rising. Families want something better: an extra room;more amenities; more pleasant surroundings. There never will be an end to the improvements which we can make in our houses if we are prepared to work andsave for them.But house building and repairs are not the only kinds of building which inthe national interest must be done: there are the factories and all forms of con-struction and civil engineering which improve our capacity to earn a higher national income: building for defence: building for the National Health Service and for education. The total amount of building that can be done will depend, not on government planning, but on the success which the building industry achieves in building faster, better and cheaper.The rate at which we can catch up on the arrears of housing and indeed of allother building work will, therefore, be determined by the capacity of the buildingindustry, and of industries which manufacture building materials. The Governmentconfidently rely on the continued co-operation of both sides of these industries.
