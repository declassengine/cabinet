Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1953SECRET &apos; OAollSU- . ,Q, i - Copy No.-&quot; RECORD COPY :C. (53) 25512th September, 1953CABINETMALTAMemorandum by the Secretary of1 State for the colonies in a separate paper (C. (53) 253), I am putting forward the proposal thatthe Prime Minister of Malta should be offered transfer of responsibility for businessconcerning Malta from the Colonial Office to the Home Office, in reply to his request in June for transfer of Maltese affairs to the Commonwealth relations office.2. The handling of this request has now been complicated by an intimationfrom Dr. Borg Olivier that his Government intend at an early date to press for full self-government for Malta within the Commonwealth, and the scrapping ofthe present dyarchical constitution.3. The proposed transfer of responsibility for Malta to the Home Officeresults directly from a request by the Maltese Prime Minister made in a memo-randum which he handed to the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs in June forthe transfer of that responsibility to the Commonwealth Relations Office.Dr. Borg Olivier has not yet had a reply to his memorandum and appears to havedecided that it now suits his book better to go off on this more extreme course.4. The occasion for this new move is a letter addressed to Dr. Borg Olivierby the Acting Governor giving him advance information of a proposed increasein the strength of the United States Naval Air Squadrons in Malta. A copy ofthe letter is at Appendix A. The proposals result from a recent joint UnitedKingdom/United States review of service requirements, and the Chiefs of staff have endorsed the requirement. Carrying out this decision in Malta fallsunambiguously under the reserved powers in the constitution. It has been thepractice to give the Maltese Government advance information of such measures and the opportunity to comment, even though there is no constitutional provisionfor this. In his reply (Appendix B) Dr. Borg Olivier contends that such arrange-ments ought not to be made without his prior concurrence, and that Malta oughtto receive a financial quid pro quo for the use of her strategic facilities. In thesame letter he indicates his intention to seek an end of the present dyarchicalconstitution, and its replacement by one of full self-government within theCommonwealth.5. There can be no going back on the defence proposals. They are part ofthe strategic plans for the defence of Malta and the Central Mediterranean. Wecannot, without throwing over the present Maltese Constitution, admit the claims of the Maltese Prime Minister to exercise a power of veto over actions by the maltese Imperial Government, in carrying out their responsibilities under theConstitution. There is more to be said on the Maltese side for their contention that there should be a &quot; long-term settlement&quot; of their financial problem, basedupon the value to Her Majesty&apos;s Government of the use of Malta as a fortress.The argument cuts both ways, because Malta could not live without the indirectrevenue received from the stationing of the Navy and other forces there. But,as Sir George Schuster in his financial report on Malta in 1950 recognised, theremay be a case for an impartial investigation into this claim.44835
APPENDIX AThe Palace, Malta;Sir, 11th August, 1953.In accordance with Her Majesty&apos;s Governments policy of giving advance information to your Government of developments in the defence sphere affectingMalta, I have the honour to bring to your notice that, following a review of thedefence requirements of the Mediterranean area, which of course closely affectthe defence of Malta, certain changes have been found to be necessary in thepresent arrangements for the accommodation on Malta airfields of elements ofthe United States Air Force,. As you are, aware, a United; States Naval AirSquadron of nine aircraft is now stationed at Luqa. Following, arrangements.agreed between the Admiralty and the United States Navy, this Squadron is to be moved from Luqa to the Naval Air Station at Hal Far as soon as the necessaryworks to provide accommodation for the aircraft and personnel can be carried out,and in order to keep pace with developments in submarine technique it will be. The Maltese Prime Minister has proved himself, over the Coronationarrangements and in many other matters, to be a man with whom it is impossibleto work in a spirit of reasonable compromise. The Acting Governor has advised that he will almost certainly now reject the offer of transfer to the Home Office.In my view, the offer should still be made, because it will demonstrate to more responsible elements in Malta that Her Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to dealsympathetically with any reasonable request which recognises the unique positionof Malta as a European fortress. This means that, as soon as possible after theoffer has been put to the Prime Minister in reply to his representations of last june, it should be made public. &apos;7. If Dr. Borg Olivier rejects the offer and proceeds along the course he has indicated, I think that the time has come for the appointment of a new RoyalCommission to enquire into the working of the 1947 Constitution. The lastRoyal Commission on Malta was the Askwith Commission of 1931, which enquiredinto the working of the 1921 Constitution. There would be no need to proceedwith this in the unlikely event of the Maltese Governments giving a reasonableresponse to the Home Office proposal, and showing co-operation over the defencematter. If, however, the Prime Minister fulfils his intention of calling a special session of the Maltese Assembly to protest about the stationing of additional unitsof the United States Air Force and to demand full self-government (possibly withan election on the issue), I should like to have authority to announce at the rightmoment that a Royal Commission will be appointed.8.   I therefore seek agreement to the following:  (1) If the proposal in my other memorandum for transfer of responsibilityfor Malta to the Home Office is approved, the Maltese Governmentto be informed, privately in the first instance, that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment cannot agree to transfer to the Commonwealth relations office but are prepared to agree in principle to the transfer of responsi-bility for Maltese affairs from the Colonial Office to the Home Office.(2) After a reasonable time has been allowed for the Maltese Prime Ministerto reply, Her Majesty&apos;s Governments answer to the representations of last June for transfer to the Commonwealth Relations Office to bemade public.(3) A decision to be taken in principle now that a Royal Commission will beappointed if the Maltese Government should turn the offer down, andcome out with a public demand for the scrapping of the present constitution and for complete self-government.O. L.Colonial Office, S.W. 1,11th September, 1953.
increased from its present strength of nine aircraft to twelve by the end of thecurrent year, and later to a total of fifteen aircraft. The length of time during whichthis arrangement will have to be continued will depend largely on whether develop-ments in the international situation permit any relaxation in the precautionary measures now deemed necessary. It will in any case be subject to the present over-riding limitations on the tenure of Hal Far by British Naval Air Forces and to ;review when necessary.2. You will know that jet bombers capable of carrying the most up-to-dateweapons are now coming into Squadron service on both sides of the Iron Curtain,and that with each new technical advance their range and speed increase., To meet these developments and provide adequate warning of a potential attack on these islands, four specially equipped United States aircraft will be stationed in Malta.(These aircraft are similar to those which were to have made a two months&apos;operational visit last year.) In present-day conditions the presence of these aircraft in Malta is, in the view of the authorities responsible for the defence of Malta, animperative necessity. The length of time during which it will be necessary tomaintain them here again depends on the international situation.3. The arrangements described above will of course involve no financial obligations on your Government. They will however necessitate various workson the airfields concerned, which will help to maintain the level of employmentlocally. The additional United States personnel required to man and service thenew aircraft, numbering approximately 300, will bring considerable spending-power and consequent benefit to the trading community.I have the honour to be,Sir,Your obedient servant,(Signed) TRAFFORD SMITH,Officer Administering the Government.The Honourable The Prime Minister.APPENDIX BSir, 18th August, 1953.I have the honour to refer to Your Excellency&apos;s letter No. 124/52 of the11th August, 1953.The new arrangements therein described which have already been decided upon without prior consultation with the Maltese Government, cannot be approvedby Ministers. I do not wish to make any special comments on paragraph 3 ofyour letter which I prefer to overlook.On the general question of the stationing of alien forces in Malta and theprovision of the strategic facilities of these Islands to foreign States, the views andfeelings of the Maltese Government have been made well known to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment. Suffice it to refer to my letter Secret 548/48 of the 11th of October,1952, and to my letter Secret 537 of the 21st of March, 1953. All these representa-tions have been persistently disregarded and the repeated insistence on the partof the Maltese Government for an early clarification of the attitude of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in regard thereto, has remained unheeded. In fact, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment, entrenching themselves behind the reservation of powers made inthe Malta Constitution and, indeed, by assuming quite arbitrary powers, have continued to dispose of the Island as they thought fit and to conclude arrangements with foreign Power-s which vitally affect the Maltese people without any reference totheir legitimate representatives.It is now quite clear that all efforts on the lines hitherto followed to try andinduce Her Majesty&apos;s Government to adopt a reasonable attitude towards the maltese Government and to give a measure of recognition to the legitimate claims of the Maltese people are doomed to failure. This Government cannot help view-ing the situation which has thus arisen with the gravest concern. The present constitution which the Maltese people.were willing to try as a provisional step
towards fuller self-government on the assumption that advantage would not havebeen taken of the Reserved Matters so as to ignore the clearest rights of the Maltese people, has proved in practice to be utterly unsatisfactory.In the circumstances the Maltese Government have come to the conclusionthat the only solution lies in a radical revision of the constitutional position. the maltese people are entitled to have a say, indeed, the only say, on all matters affect-ing them. This can only be achieved by full autonomy, within the Commonwealth,in all fields of Government. &quot; Imperial interests,&quot; on the grounds of which aloneHer Majesty&apos;s Government have so far denied recognition of the rights of the maltese people, should not stand in the way. Such interests could be quiteadequately and, indeed, more effectively provided for by safeguards arranged withthe voluntary consent of the Maltese people rather than by arbitrary impositionsby Her Majesty&apos;s Government.Ministers, after the most careful consideration, have now inevitably set them-selves this aim. They intend at an early date to seek the approval and supportof Parliament for their proposed course of action and thereafter to take action by all the means available to them for the attainment of the purpose.On the particular matter dealt with in Your Excellency&apos;s letter under reference,it is now clear that the arrangements for the posting of certain elements of theAmerican Naval Air Force in Malta covered by the correspondence ending with sir Gerald Creasy&apos;s letter of the 18th of January, 1953, are now being substantiallyvaried. When the question regarding those arrangements was raised in the Legis-lative Assembly, I relayed to the House the assurances I had received that those arrangements were purely temporary, and that the stay of those members of theAmerican Forces was only for operational training purposes. There is now nodoubt that the American Forces in question are being stationed on the Islandindefinitely and it is further clear that the American Forces are in effect establishing a base on the Island. In these circumstances I feel it is my duty to inform Parlia-ment of these new developments. I will be bound to disclose to the House thefacts stated in your letter regarding the transfer to the Hal Far Naval Air Station,the increase in the number of aircraft and personnel, and the important fact thatthe proposed arrangements will hold good as long as Her Majesty&apos;s government consider that this is required. I have already mentioned this possibility to YourExcellency and I gathered that, to the extent above envisaged, there would be noobjection to the proposed disclosure.I have the honour to be,Sir,Your obedient servant,(Signed) G. BORG OLIVIER.His Excellency The Officer Administering the Government.
