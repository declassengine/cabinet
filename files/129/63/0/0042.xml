(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(53) 292 COPY NO. vP-/19TH OCTOBER, 1953CABINETNO-NEW-PREFERENCE RULEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe President of the Board of Trade recommends in C. (53) 283 thatif our request for a general waiver of the No-New-Preference Rule is refusedat the present session of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.)Her Majesty&apos;s Government should proceed as if the waiver had been granted -i. e. , raise the duties on certain foreign products without imposing duties oncorresponding Commonwealth products.2.        Such a course of action involves an open and deliberate breach of therules of the General Agreement.    The effects of such a breach of an inter-national agreement would be most harmful and could not be confined to theforum of the G.A.T.T.    By setting an example of intentional disregard of therules, we should be playing into the hands of the protectionists in the U.S.A.at a time when it is in our interests to strengthen the hands of the liberalelements on the Randall Commission;  we should antagonise the Europeanswho tend to look to us both in the G. A. T. T. and the Organisation for european economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) to set a good example vis-a-vis the UnitedStates.    This would be particularly embarrassing for me as Chairman of theO.E.E.C.    It could also be argued that by thus weakening the G.A. T.T. weshould jeopardise the Collective Approach which, as we have already announced,is to be in part achieved through such international institutions as the G.A.T.T.3.        Although it may be argued that our action is not intended to diverttrade to the Commonwealth and is therefore only a technical breach ofArticle I of the G.A..T.T. , nevertheless Her Majesty&apos;s Government consideredthe matter important enough to place their request for a waiver of this rulebefore the Contracting Parties.    We have also lobbied intensively on itsbehalf.    To act in disregard of the decision of the Contracting Parties torefuse to grant a general waiver would therefore be much more invidious than any ordinary infringement of the rules.4.        In a footnote to the Presidents paper j a fourth course of action is mentioned, viz. , that pending the review of the G.A, Ti T. recourse might be had to individual waivers of the No-New-Preference rule which the ContractingParties have expressed their willingness to grant.    Admittedly procedure by individual waivers has certain defects in that the case for each product hasto be argued, and the United Kingdom still would not possess the samefreedom as other countries over her unbound tariff.    But this method wouldgive us our essential requirement, freedom to give protection to homeproducers without imposing duties on Commonwealth goods.    Until suchwaivers were granted, the existing quota protection would of course continue.
5.        There will inevitably be criticism of the G.A.T.T. in the United Kingdomif our request for a general waiver is refused.    Since the difference between ageneral and an individual waiver is of a technical nature not easily understood,I foresee less public criticism if a specific waiver is accepted than if our delegation returns from Geneva with no waiver at all.6.        The General Agreement will probably be reviewed within the next18 months.    Any action which we decide upon now therefore has only to suffice for a short time.    Rather than incur the harmful effects of an open and deliberate breach of an international agreement, I recommend that we choose to accept for this short period the method of individual waivers, and defendour action by an undertaking to take the general question up again when theG.A.T.T. comes up for review.A.E.Foreign Office, S. W.l.19TH OCTOBER, 1953.
