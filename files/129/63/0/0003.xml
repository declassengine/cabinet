Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1953.CABINE. I   OrriCc Copy No.RECORD COPYCABINETTRANSFER OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR MALTA TO THE HOME office memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies on 30th July, the Cabinet agreed in principle that means should be sought ofassimilating the constitutional position of Malta to that of the Channel Islands andthe Isle of Man, under the Home Office. I was invited in consultation with theHome Secretary and the Commonwealth Secretary to consider further some of thepoints made in discussion (C.C. (53) 47th Conclusions, Minute 3).2.   The questions for further study were: -(a) Whether the proposal was consistent with a long-term pattern for thedevelopment of Commonwealth relations. The Cabinet wished to be assured that, if the Channel Islands/Isle of Man relationship with the privy Council were adapted to resolve current difficulties with Malta,this would provide a constitutional status to which other small colonial dependencies could aspire.(b) Whether, with an eye to the future, it would not be well to lay moreemphasis on the jurisdiction of the Privy Council than that of a par-ticular Minister.(c) What assessment was made of the additional administrative work whichwould be thrown on the Home Office as a result of transfer of responsi-bility for Malta, and by what means these newer duties would becarried out.3. Points (a) and (b) may be taken together. It seems preferable to con-sider only the relationship between the Channel Islands and the Privy Councilsince the Isle of Man has not attained the same autonomy as the Channel islands and Malta for, in the Isle of Man, the executive authority is vested in the Governorwho also possesses the sole right of proposing taxation. The rest of thismemorandum will accordingly deal only with the position vis-a-vis the channel islands.4. The implication of extending to Malta and other small Colonial territories the historical relationship of the Channel Islands to the Privy Council are as follows.When, in 1801, the responsibility for the possessions of the Crown outside theUnited Kingdom was transferred from the Home Secretary, he neverthelessretained responsibility for the Channel Islands. These dependencies aredistinguished from the other oversea dependencies by the antiquity of their con-nection with the Sovereign as well as by their proximity to Great Britain. While itis within the competence of the Parliament at Westminster to legislate for theChannel Islands, that procedure is seldom followed nowadays and the channel islands make most of their own laws in their respective assemblies. Acts of theUnited Kingdom Parliament only apply to them by exceptional procedure but maybe extended to them with adaptations by Order in Council. The legislation passed in the Islands, however, requires ratification by Order in Council. It is the practiceat the beginning of each reign to appoint a committee of the Privy Council to hearpetitions from the Islands. Committees of the Privy Council are also occasionallyanpointed ad hoc to enquire into some question of special importance. In the islands, public revenue is a local matter, though proposals to raise taxes requireauthorisation by Order in Council.secret. (53) 25312th September, 195344834
5. The present constitutional arrangements in Malta, which would have to be adapted to fit in with this new relationship, derive from Letters Patent of .1947providing for responsible Government. Under these, in brief, legislation is withinthe jurisdiction of the Governor acting with the advice and consent of an elected assembly, except for matters concerning defence, foreign relations, currency, immi-gration and a number of other subjects which are specified as reserved, and inrespect of which the Governor legislates without reference to the Assembly. (her majesty in Council also has power to legislate in respect of these reserved subjects and to pass emergency laws.) The Governor has power to withhold his assent.to a Bill passed by the Assembly or to reserve it for signification of Her Majesty&apos;pleasure. Even if a Bill passed by the Assembly receives the Governor^ assent itmay be disallowed by Her Majesty.6. The chief constitutional effect of bringing Malta into the same relation-ship with the Privy Council as the Channel Islands would be that legislation ofthe Maltese Parliament would in future require in all cases ratification by Orderin Council unless legal means can be devised whereby the present arrangementsfor signification of Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure could be continued.7. There would not seem to be any practical difficulty in adapting the special relationship to the Privy Council to the circumstances of Malta, if the maltese government agreed to the proposal. The proposal is not being considered as a means of enhancing Malta&apos;s constitutional status, but rather as providing machineryfor handling relations with Malta which may be more acceptable to opinion in thatColony. Its principal merit is that it appears to offer a closer relationship withthe United Kingdom, and to remove Maltese dissatisfaction at being lumpedtogether with the African Colonial territories. Our study has confirmed us inthe understanding that there is no apparent constitutional reason why Malta shouldnot be brought under the arrangement, which has hitherto- been distinctive to theChannel Islands and the Isle of Man. In presenting the proposal to Malta it would,in my opinion, be better to emphasise the transfer to the Home Secretary ratherthan the special relationship with the Privy Council. This would probably be more attractive to Maltese opinion, which may be puzzled by the novel idea of comingunder the Privy Council and suspicious of its implications. At the same time, Iam advised by the Governor and Acting Governor that the proposal is likely to bemuch less acceptable to Maltese opinion if emphasis is placed upon comparabilitywith the position of the Channel Islands. Maltese preference would no doubt befor comparison with Northern Ireland, but that should be avoided lest it invitesMaltese proposals for representation at Westminster.8. I turn to the relationship proposed for Malta as a possible pattern for thefuture constitutional status of the smaller Colonies. The Colonial territoriesmay be broadly divided into three groups:  (i) those which might be considered, in the fairly near future,, as qualified for independent self-government;(ii) those which might so qualify eventually, but would require a period of apprentiship in some interim status; and(iii) those which, on account of small size and resources, are unlikely to becomefull member Countries of the Commonwealth.In this last group there are some which are likely nevertheless to. attain- a large measure of internal self-government. Malta, although in some respects in a special position as a fortress in Europe, can also be regarded as the first in point of timeof this last group, as it already enjoys internal self-government. Some special statusmay have to be found to recognise the self-governing position of such territories independence on the United Kingdom. Their relationship with the Crown throughthe Privy Council may well be found a convenient means of satisfying theiraspirations. An advantage of such a relationship&apos; might be that territories withwidely differing circumstances could be brought together under a single iltimate authority, while responsibility could still be assigned to different Secretaries of Stateaccording to the circumstances of the territories concerned. In view of Malta&apos;sproximity and European character it would seem that the responsibility in this case should be assigned to the. Home Secretary. Future territories becoming eligible forthis status, particularly:those far afield and with a largely non-European population,may well fall more logically under the responsibility of the Colonial Secretary orother Minister.   When such cases come up for consideration it may be desirable
to lay more emphasis on the jurisdiction of the Privy Council than on the identity of the particular Secretary of State who will assume responsibility under the privy council.9. As regards the additional administrative work which would be thrown onthe Home Office, the handling of Maltese affairs at present occupies in the ColonialOffice slightly more than half the time of one Principal, and one Assistant Principal,and about a third of the time of one Assistant Secretary. Owing to the political difficulties involved, Malta has usually demanded a disproportionate amount of thetime of higher officials. If responsibility were transferred, to the Home Office, this ,would mean some increase of. administrative staff of that. Department.; It is hoped;that this would not mean more than the part-time employment of one extraPrincipal and Assistant Principal.10. The question arises of the specialist Departments (e.g., medical, educa-tional, &amp;c, advisers, and the Economic and Finance Departments) which are avail-able in the Colonial Office, to officers dealing with each territory, but would not be generally available in the Home Office. My Department would gladly put atdisposal the services of any of these specialist Departments of which the HomeOffice might wish to make use. In fact, as Malta is internally self-governing, it makes practically no demands at present on most of the Colonial Office specialist services. The only two specialist Departments of theOffice which are much brought in on Maltese affairs are the Defence Department on reserved subjects and theFinance Department whenever there is any Maltese request for financial assistance.It is thought that the defence work, requiring liaison with the Service Departments,could be handled without undue difficulty in the Home Office. On financial questions, it could readily be arranged for the Home Office to draw upon ColonialOffice experience in dealing with recent Maltese financial problems by consulting the officers concerned in the Colonial Office.11. One of the financial questions would be whether Malta should continueunder the Home Office to receive financial help under the scope of the colonial development and Welfare Acts. It would be practicable for this to continue, byanalogy with the Colonial Development and Welfare grants to South AfricanHigh Commission Territories, Which are administered by the commonwealth relations Office. It would be for separate consideration, however, whether futurefinancial aid to Malta under the Home Office was given partly by colonial development and Welfare grant and partly by subvention, or wholly by the latter.12.   As regards the staff of the Imperial Maltese Government in Malta supplied from the United Kingdom, the existing posts are:  .Governor. Normally appointed from the Colonial Service. The presentGovernors appointment will terminate in September 1954.Lieutenant-Governor. Normally an officer of the Colonial Service, butat present an Assistant Secretary on temporary transfer from theColonial Office (for two years in the first instance, with effect from28th March, 1953).Legal Secretary. An officer of the Colonial Legal Service. The presentholder only took up the appointment in May 1953 (on transfer from malaya).Director of Civil Aviation. A specialist appointment.Under the proposed new arrangements it might no longer be consideredappropriate that the appointments of Governor, Lieutenant-Governor and legal secretary should normally be filled from the Colonial Service, but it is not suggestedthat the tenure of any of the existing holders need be prematurely terminated. Infuture the posts on the Governors senior staff could be filled either by temporaryposting from the Home Service or by ad hoc appointment.13. In the light of the above detailed study, I invite my colleagues to confirm that there is no practical objection to the offer being made to the Maltese Govem-ment that responsibility for their affairs can be transferred to the Home Office.If this is accepted, the Maltese Prime Minister would be informed along the &apos;following lines. His proposal for transfer of responsibility for Malta to the Com-&apos;commonwealth Relations Office cannot be agreed to. The position of Malta as afortress necessarily entails some constitutional restrictions oh full self-government
Colonial Office, S.W.1,11th September, 1953.in the fields of external affairs and defence. On account of this, and of her smallsize and lack of natural resources, she is not in the view of Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment eligible to be considered for full independent membership of the Common-wealth. Although the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations is theMinister charged with responsibility for relations with the Central african federation and the South African High Commission Territories, these are whollyexceptional arrangements for which there are special historical reasons. her majesty&apos;s Government cannot agree to any further extension of the commonwealth secretary&apos;s functions beyond his proper one of handling relations with fullyindependent members of the Commonwealth. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have,however, considered sympathetically the arguments in the Maltese memorandum and recognise the unique position of Malta as a fortress in Europe with a longhistory of civilisation and of service in peace and war, most recently recognised bythe exceptional award of the George Cross. In these circumstances, they considerthat it would be appropriate to transfer responsibility for handling Maltese affairs to the Home Secretary, who is the Secretary of State immediately concerned asThe Queen&apos;s Minister in relation to the United Kingdom and neighbouring islands.It should be explained that Malta would come under the authority of The Queen inCouncil, with the Home Secretary as responsible Minister.14. I now seek my colleagues&apos; approval to this offer being made, but in aseparate paper (C. (53) 255) I explain some recent political developments in Maltawhich require this proposal to be examined in a wider context.O. L.
