COPY NO. fOKOREA:   POLITICAL conference memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsRe comme ndationsI have been considering what should be our aims and objectives inthe Political Conference on Korea, if it meets.   I recommend to my colleagues that:-(a) we should aim in the first place at the creation by peaceful meansof a unified and neutralised Korea;(b) to achieve this we should plan to proceed by five successive stages:-(i)  free elections in all Korea under international supervision;(ii)  the establishment of an all-Korean Government based on theele actions;(iii)  the unification of the country;(iv) measures for neutralisation;(v) the  withdrawal of foreign forces from either side;(c) if a unified Korea cannot be achieved, we should be prepared toconsider other solutions, such as the maintenance of a divided Korea underappropriate guarantees with perhaps a buffer zone in the middle;(d) the present paper be approved as the basis for an immediateexchange of views with the old Commonwealth countries, the United States andFrance.Discussion2. The United Nations side must seize and retain the initiative inthe Conference. We should come to it with a constructive plan which willcommand the ready support of world opinion. If the Conference fails, theresponsibility must be seen clearly to rest with the Communists.3. The United Nations are committed to work for the peaceful creationof a unified, independent and democratic Korea,   As a first step we should propose the holding of free elections in all Korea under international supervision.We think that Syngman Rhee has enough genuine support to win even in north korea,   The elections should be followed by the formation of a government secret.

and the unification of the country.   A unified Korea would have to beneutralised.   The Great Powers and Japan would need to give guaranteesagainst aggression and receive safeguards from Korea.   Without these, theChinese and Russians could not be expected to agree to a unified non-Communist Korea.4. The Communists may follow the German pattern and suggest the formation of a joint North/South Korean Government before elections.We could not accept this.   It would enable the Communists to infiltratethe Government and thus secure the control of all Korea that they couldnot win by war.5. If it is impossible to reach agreement on the unification of Korea,all possible means should be sought to reach a modus vivendi which would reduce tension and permit the withdrawal of some, even if not all, troops.For example, the existing demilitarised zone might be expanded to create a buffer zone, which would be policed by an International Force under thecontrol of a joint or neutral Commission.   The phased withdrawal of foreigntroops might follow.6. If the Communists are not prepared to consider even such an interim scheme, the only possible course will be to leave Korea divided,with foreign troops stationed on both sides of the armistice line.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.16th October, 1953.
