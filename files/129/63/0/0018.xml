29th SEPTEMBER, 1953.CABINETTRIESTEMemorandum by the Cord President of the CouncilMy colleagues will no doubt be aware that the long-standing Italo-Yugoslav dispute about the future of the Free Territory has recently flaredup into certain limited but highly publicised Italian military movements in thefrontier area and to an acrimonious exchange of incivilities between PresidentTito and the Italian Prime Miinister.   This represents the climax in the&quot;serious malaise in Italo-Yugoslav relations&quot; to which the Foreign Secretaryreferred in C. (52) 384.   Although the tension seems to have been slightlyrelaxed recently, as a result of the counsels of moderation urged on bothsides by the United Kingdom and United States Governments, the situationremains explosive, and calls for a serious effort to reach an immediatesolution of the Trieste problem.background. As my colleagues know, the Foreign Secretary has long beenconvinced that the only immediately practicable solution is a permanent divisionof the Free Territory on the basis of the existing boundary between Zones A and B.It is the only solution which Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the United StatesGovernment are in a position to enforce, by withdrawing their troops and allied military Government (A.M.G.) from Zone A and handing it over to the ItalianGovernment.   At the beginning of this year there were, in the opinion of theForeign Office, good prospects of both the Yugoslavs and the Italians accepting this solution.   But the opportunity was missed because the Americans were unwilling to urge it on Signor de Gasperi.3. In the ensuing period all attempts by the United States Governmentto find a solution on other lines have failed, and the recent exacerbation of the Italo-Yugoslav dispute has at last brought the State Department round to our  -point of view.   On 14th September they presented to us detailed proposals for bringing about a division of the territory along the existing zonal boundary.The Foreign Office have examined these proposals and consider them to be broadly acceptable.   The State Department have accepted certain amendments which we suggested to them after consulting H.M, Ambassadors at Rome andBelgrade.   The plan is complicated, and further consultation with the americans will be necessary on the details of procedure before we are ready to approach the Italian and the Yugoslav Governments.   But we and the Americans bothconsider, and are so advised by our representatives at Rome and Belgrade,that the sooner we act the easier it will be to put the plan into effect.Italian and Yugoslav Positions4. These have unfortunately hardened since the beginning of the year.Signor Pella has publicly demanded a Five-Power Conference (Italy, Yugoslavia,^1-The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No...o A o i i&apos;&apos;i   U r f&quot; i vj cc.(53) 268 RECORD COPY
the United Kingdom, the United States, France) to arrange a plebiscite in thewhole Free Territory.   Tito has publicly demanded both Zones for Yugoslavia,with the exception of Trieste City, which he proposes should be internationalised.Although both sides are pressing for their proposals to be seriously considered,each well knows that its plan is completely unacceptable to the other, and cannot be enforced.   My information, however, is that they might both bebrought to acqtiiesce in an enforced settlement on the zonal boundary.   Themain difficulty here is that whereas the only hope of persuading Tito to acquiesce is by making absolutely clear that the settlement is final, the Italianscould not acquiesce now in a settlement that involved a public  renunciation of italian claims to Zone 3.Summary of United Kingdom/United States Flan5. (i) The plan which I submit for the consideration of my colleaguestakes account, so far as is possible, of the difficulties which I have described above.   It brings United States and British policy on Trieste into line.   TheItalian and Yugoslav Governments would be informed by the United Kingdomand United States Governments that the recent Italo-Yugoslav tension overTrieste has convinced us that the present situation cannot be allowed tocontinue.   We have therefore decided to bring about a settlement on the existingzonal boundary by withdrawing our troops and handing over Zone A to Italianadministration.   This constitutes a de facto settlement;  but v/e have everyintention that it should be permanent.   (The Italian Government will not beexpected to adhere formally to this interpretation. )  We should require fromTito an adequate assurance that he would not attack the Italians in Zone A.At this stage the plan would be abandoned only (a) if Tito failed to give suchassurance or (b) if the Italians refused to take over Zone A in these conditions.In fact I think it unlikely that Tito would take up so extreme a position or that Signor Pella could afford to miss such a chance of obtaining Zone A for italy.(ii) If Italian and Yugoslav reactions were satisfactory, Her MajestyVsGovernment and the United States Government would publicly announce that,since their efforts to at^ply the Peace Treaty and to encourage direct negotiations had failed, they had decided that there was no alternative to thewithdrawal of A.1V1.G. and Allied troops and permitting the Italian Government toextend Italian administrative and military control to Zone A.   Transfer to italian control would take place simultaneously or as soon as possible.   (Exacttiming would depend on consultation between the British and United StatesChiefs of Staff with the Zone Commander, which must be completed beforeaction is initiated on the plan.)  In order to give the Yugoslavs some quid pro quowe ourselves would like to add that, though the settlement would be de facto,we intended that it should be permanent and that we would not support anyclaims by either party across the new national frontier.   This would be tantamount to tearing up the 1948 Tripartite Declaration and the Americans are at presenthesitant about doing this.   But we will push them as far as we can.(iii) In the event of Yugoslavia then annexing Zone 3, we should raiseno objection:  nor should we object to Italy annexing Zone A.(iv) Italy and Yugoslavia would be required to give assurances regardingminorities and civil rights.   Italy would also be required to give assurancesto Yugoslavia and Austria about free port facilities at Trieste.(v) Eventually, the new de facto situation would be brought to the notice ofthe Security Council.   The Soviet attitude might involve asking the general assembly to endorse the solution.
Pros and Cons of the Plan6. The a advantages of taking action are as follows.   The presentsituation is intolerable.   It prevents further progress in strategic planning ina vulnerable sector of Western Europe.   It ties up 5,000 British troopsuselessly in Trieste.   It embitters our relations with Italy and with Yugoslavia.World opinion is expecting the United States and the United Kingdom to intervene decisively, and would probably approve a &quot;Judgment of Solomon&quot;with no apparent bias in favour of either side.   Lastly, this is thefirst time that the United States Government have been prepared to throw their full weight into the scales.   If we now refuse to carry out a solution which wehave ourselves been advocating for the past year, it may be long before asimilar opportunity again presents itself.7, The following are the disadvantages.   The plan is difficult andcomplicated.   Tito&apos;s reactions cannot be foreseen.   If he adopted an attitudeso threatening as to cause us to abandon the plan, while the Italians were ready to acquiesce, we should not only have failed to achieve our object butalso have jeopardised still further our relations with both countries.   Again,tension is so high between Italy and Yugoslavia that Allied action must involve some risk of precipitating an armed clash.   There are risks and difficultiesin the prospects of divided control in Zone A after the Italians have assumedcontrol but before the Allies have fully evacuated the Zone.   Indeed, thepossibility of a clash between the United States/United Kingdom forces and the yugoslavs, or even the Italians, cannot altogether be excluded, though it is not thought to be a likely danger.conclusion. Nevertheless, after studying the problem with the greatest care,I have come to the conclusion that the dangers of inaction are worse than thoseof action,     I think that the time has come to grasp this nettle and show bothItalians and Yugoslavs that we mean business.   No doubt there will be howlsof protest and we shall be bitterly reproached by both countries.   But theyare both receiving so many benefits, Italy from her membership of the north atlantic Treaty Organisation and Yugoslavia from her special relationship withthe major &quot;Western Powers, that I do not believe that either would, whenconfronted with a firm decision by Her iViajesty&apos;s Government and the UnitedStates Government, attempt to frustrate it without regard for the consequences.9. I therefore ask my colleagues for authority to pursue the plan withthe Americans.   I would propose to report again to the Cabinet  is soon as thefinal details have been worked out and we are ready to go ahead.   I am in touchwith the Chiefs of Staff over the military problems involved.   Nothing has yetbeen said to the French Government owing to the danger of a leak to the Italians,but we should hope to secure French support for the plan.as soon as the mainoutlines have been agreed upon with the Americans.S.Foreign Office, 3.W.1,29th September, 1953.
