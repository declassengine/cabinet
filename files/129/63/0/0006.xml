(53) 256 RECORD COPY14th September, 1953 i--f,CABINETSECURITY ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE SOVIET union memorandum by the Lord President of the council I. The ObjectiveOur principal aim in any possible four-Power talks with Russia will be tosecure the reunification of Germany on the basis of free elections for an all-GermanGovernment, but without giving away the European Defence Community. Ourview is that such a Government must be free to enter into associations compatible with the principles and the purposes of the United Nations. This impliesGermany&apos;s right to associate with the West through the E.D.C. If Russia can bebrought to reach an agreement with the West on this basis she will consider thatin accepting German reunification and remilitarisation on these terms she will havemade major concessions and will expect something substantial in return. We must assume that she will want to protect herself and her satellites against attack byGermany acting alone or in conjunction with E.D.C. and N.A.T.O. Powers. Wecan and shall argue that German membership of the E.D.C. is in itself, for theEast as much as for the West, the best safeguard against German aggression, both because Germany will no longer be able to take individual decisions leading towar and also because under the E.D.C. agreements she will be limited to 12 divi-sions. But the Russians will expect some further guarantee covering possibly theAustrian as well as the German frontiers.2. Such a guarantee would necessarily depend upon an agreement on germany&apos;s eastern frontiers. The demarcation of these frontiers will form partof the peace treaty negotiations, which cannot take place until an all-GermanGovernment has been formed. It follows that any security guarantee must be envisaged as the climax of a series of agreements constituting a German settlement.But if we are to make any progress in that direction it will be necessary in thecourse of the four-Power talks to offer, and to discuss at least in principle, sucha guarantee. Quite apart from the Soviet position it is important from the pointof view of Western public opinion that such an offer should be made. This applies particularly to France where such an offer may be necessary in order to produce the right climate for the ratification of the E.D.C. Treaty. It may prove to bethe best tactics to make an offer at an early stage in the negotiations. Indeed, ifthe four-Power talks fail and no progress is made towards the reunification ofGermany, it may still be desirable to give the U.S.S.R. some kind of assurance,,either in the form of an agreement or a declaration, accompanying the entry-into-force of the E.D.C. and the rearmament of the German Federal Republic within it..II. Present Proposals3. On May 11 the Prime Minister proposed that &quot; the master thought whichanimated Locarno might well play its part between Germany and Russia.&quot; This,idea has since been echoed in other quarters:  (a) Dr. Adenauer&apos;s proposal to the Foreign Ministers in Washington that theE.D.C. should be the basis of a security system which would take intoconsideration the security needs of all nations including Russia.   He.44840
has since amplified it as follows: &quot; the regional alliance of the european community, having been associated with N.A.T.O., can be broughtinto a treaty relationship with the regional alliances of the eastern blocwithin a structure to be developed within the United Nations &quot;; thisarrangement to be reinforced by increased East-West trade.(b) M. Alphand, the French representative to N.A.T.O., during a recent con-versation at the Foreign Office suggested that upon the entry-into-forceof the E.D.C. Treaty, the E.D.C. Powers and the United Kingdom andthe United States might declare or offer to conclude an agreement thatthe E.D.C. would never be used for aggressive purposes nor resort to force to redress frontiers in Europe,(c) M. Spaak, in a memorandum on behalf of the European Movement, has proposed that multilateral non-aggression pacts might be concluded,within the framework of the United Nations security system, in whichthe U.S.S.R., the E.D.C., the United States and the United kingdom might participate, and with which other European states might be associated.III. Existing Treaties4. The United Nations Charter already provides in theory precisely thesecurity which Russia seeks, but she will no doubt claim, as we have claimed injustification for N.A.T.O., that the United Nations machinery is not adequate. Itis essential, however, that any new guarantee, should be consistent with the united nations Charter and should indeed be regarded as a collective security arrangement under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.5. Under the Anglo-Russian Treaty of 1942 and the Franco-Russian Treatyof 1944 the United Kingdom and France are bound to go to the assistance ofRussia if attacked by Germany.   The United States has no parallel obligation.6. The United Kingdom, France and United States are committed todefending the German Federal Republic and Berlin against attack. When shebecomes a member of the E.D.C. Germany would in the event of attack be assisted by her E:D.C. partners, the United Kingdom and the members of N.A.T.O.IV. Basic Requirements of any New Security Agreement7. Ideally any new security guarantee should satisfy all the following conditions: -(a) the United States must be party to the agreement;(b) it must not appear to commit us to recognise the satellites as beingpermanently in the Soviet zone of influence or to accept the presentdivision of Europe as permanent;(c) it must not commit the Western Powers to intervene in a conflict between members of the Soviet bloc;(d) it must not preclude German membership of the E.D.C.;(e) it should cover Russia against attack by Germany alone or in association with E.D.C. or other Powers;(/) whilst we do not want to go beyond Europe, it should be capable of being developed in case Russia wants some arrangement which would cover any attack by any of the signatories on one another;(g) in case Four-Power talks fail and no progress is made towards Germanreunification, it should be capable of being applied provisionally to theGerman Federal Republic as a member of E.D.C.V. Particular Points of Difficulty8. Apart from the problem of Germany&apos;s eastern frontiers, which for thepurposes of this paper we must assume will somehow be settled, points of particular difficulty will be  : -(a) the extent to which the United States Government can or wiil accept anyfurther treaty commitments in Europe;
(b) the extent to which the United Kingdom can accept any treaty commit-ment which could possibly involve lining up with the U.S.S.R. againstthe United States. This is precisely the point on which the negotiations in Moscow in 1947 for an extension1 of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty broke down, as the Russians wanted to manoeuvre us into this position. Itmust be remembered that this is not excluded by the United nations charter&apos; itself. Whilst this difficulty may be largely theoretical, wemust clearly select the method least open to objection on this account;(c) the extent to which the United Kingdom can accept any commitment to intervene in a dispute between Germany and a Soviet satellite. Anysuch commitment is fraught with danger, but the U.S.S.R. may wellregard as inadequate any security guarantee which would not operate inthe event of a German attack upon Poland or Czechoslovakia.VI.-Possible Alternatives in the Event of Germany being Reunified(a) A Non-Aggression Pact or Declaration9. We can safely offer to reaffirm the peaceful and defensive purposes of theE.D.C. and N.A.T.O. and our undertakings in the United Nations Charter to refrain from the threat or use of force. In order to avoid an East-West line-up (cf. 7 (b)above) any pact that may be negotiated should be preferably not a bilateral agree-ment between the Western and Eastern blocs, but a multilateral agreement betweenthe individual States. A non-aggression pact, whatever its form is, however,unlikely to satisfy the Russians unless it provides for action or mutual assistancein the event of attack or an attempt to alter frontiers by force.(b) A multilateral agreement providing for mutual assistance in the event of aggression.This might involve us in a conflict between members of the Soviet bloc andraises all the difficulties mentioned in paragraph 8. We clearly cannot go so faras this; nor could the United States.(c) Agreement between the United Kingdom, United States, U.S.S.R., France and.Germany for mutual assistance in the event of attack by any signatory,whether acting alone or in conjunction with other Powers, on anothersignatory.This is the type of guarantee which the U.S.S.R. might want (cf. paragraph  (/)). It fulfils the main requirements set out in Section IV; but, even if its scopewere limited to Europe, it involves formidable commitments for the United King-dom and raises in acute form the difficulty mentioned in paragraph 8 (b). i recommend that we should not make such an offer ourselves, but should wait tosee whether the Russians propose it.(d) An agreement similar to (c) except that it would operate only in the event of anattack across the frontiers fixed by the German and A ustrian Treaties.^ Our commitments would be less extensive than under (c), but still far-reaching.The Russians would obtain substantial safeguards though they would not be covered against an attack by Germany on one of the satellites. This couldbe remedied by bringing in all Germany&apos;s neighbours as signatories to the agree-ment. But then the United Kingdom would be committed to intervene (see para-graph 8 (c)).(e) A non-aggression pact between the E.D.C. Powers (and, if necessary, Austria)on the one hand and the Russian bloc on the other; guaranteed by theUnited States and the United Kingdom (and possibly by other non-E.D.C.members of N.A.T.O.) who would undertake to go to the assistance of theparty attacked.Under this arrangement there would be no chance of our having to act againstthe United States. We should, however, be committed to act if Germany or theE.D.C. were to attack any member of the Soviet bloc and we should be crystallisingthe present division of Europe. -
VII. Possible Alternatives if (Germany is not Reunified10. The failure of Four-Power talks will mean that there are no agreedfrontiers as basis for a security guarantee. We should therefore be thrown backon some non-a2gression pact or declaration as suggested in paragraph 9 (a), (e)or (ft.VIII.-Conclusions11. None of the alternatives in paragraph 9 provides an ideal solution. Iwould rule out (b) and reserve judgment on (c) until we have a clearer idea ofRussian requirements. I recommend that we should now discuss the subject withthe Americans and the French on the basis of alternatives (a), (d), (e) and (/) witha view to agreeing a tripartite proposal to put to the Russians at Lugano, and thatwe should also explore the possibility of framing some guarantee on the basis ofalternatives (a), (e) and (/) which could be applied if the Four-Power talks fail.These three alternatives are really different Ways of formulating the same idea, andon the whole it seems to me that alternative (e) provides the most hopeful solution.S.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,14th September, 1953.(/) An agreement between (or declaration by) the N.A.T..O. Powers that, if Ger-many or the E.D.C. committed an act of aggression, action would be taken under the North Atlantic Treaty, either under Article 4 (consultation) orunder Article 5 (individual or collective measures to restore the situation).Such an agreement would lack any element of reciprocity and might fail tosatisfy the Russians. On the other hand, it might be the sort of commitment whichthe United States Congress could most easily accept and would at least be a tokenfor the Russians of our good intentions.
