CABINETEGYPT: DEFENCE negotiations memorandum by the Lord Privy SealIntroductionThe Cabinet, at their meeting on 8th September, appointed a CabinetCommittee under my Chairmanship &quot;to make recommendations on the pointsstill outstanding in the defence negotiations with Egypt and to consider, inparticular, the possibility of including in the preamble to the Agreement an appropriate formula about the international rights of passage through the suez Canal&quot; (C. C (53) 51st Conclusions, Minute 2).    The Committee have held one meeting, attended by the Minister of Transport, the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Leathers,General Sir Brian Robertson and representatives of the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Commonwealth Secretary.    I now report to the Cabinet onthe Committee&apos;s behalf.Freedom of navigation through the Suez Canal2.        Lord Leathers and the Minister of Transport represented strongly to the Committee that at least an attempt should be made to have this vitalmatter covered by an Article in the Defence Agreement itself.     They arguedin support of this view:-(a) that its inclusion in the preamble to the Agreementonly would not be regarded by public opinion athome as an adequate replacement for Article 8of the 193 6 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty (reproduced in annex A to this memorandum);(b) that such an Article would give us a firmer basis for making representations if Egypt failed to live upto her undertakings;and (c)    that, if we were to acquiesce in its exclusion from the body of the Agreement in the expectation that wewould eventually be successful with our plan for a multilateral approach to the Egyptian government by all the principle maritime Powers, we wouldrisk being accused by those Powers of having soldthe pass in advance.On the other hand, it was represented to us by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that a clause in the preamble might bepositively better as a prelude to a subsequent multilateral approach to egypt than an article in the Agreement, which the Egyptians might argueS3CRET CABINET office.(53) 254 RECORD 00 Elf COPY NO.   4x14TK SEPTEMBER, 1953 &apos;
3s7had concluded the matter;  and, by General Sir Brian Robertson, that, if atthis stage we were to ask for too much from the Egyptians on this matter, we might well not only fail to obtain anything but also prejudice the chances of egyptian agreement to our proposals on other outstanding points.3.        The Committee felt that it was essential, in balancing these opposingconsiderations, to keep in mind that it would be necessary at the appropriate time to secure approval by Parliament of the terms of the Defence Agreementwith Egypt and that Government supporters, in particular, might not besatisfied if reference in the Agreement to the Suez Canal were to be confined to a Clause in the preamble alone.    They therefore agreed to recommend to the Cabinet that the matter should be handled on the following lines.    our delegation should be instructed to secure Egyptian agreement to the inclusion in the preamble to the Agreement, which it is intended should contain an out-line of the objects of the Agreement generally, of a clause in the following terms:-&quot;Recognising the economic, commercial and strategic importance of the Suez Canal as an international waterwayand being agreed as to the necessity of preserving andupholding the principles of freedom of navigation set forth in the international Convention at present governing the useof the Canal;&quot;.It should also be made clear to the Egyptian negotiators that we wish such a clause in the preamble to the Agreement to be followed up by the inclusion ofa suitable article in the body of the Agreement itself at the later stage whenthe Articles of the Agreement come to be prepared.    If our Delegation areunable to obtain Egyptian agreement to the inclusion of the proposed clause in the preamble they should report back in order that the matter may beconsidered further by the Cabinet.4.        The Committee were informed that it could be expected that, as soonas agreement had been reached with the Egyptians on all outstanding points,an agreed communique would be issued announcing the substance of theAgreement, which would thereafter be embodied in formal Articles,    If theCommitteers proposals for the handling of the Sues Canal issue in relation tothe Agreement are approved by the Cabinet and subsequently prove acceptable to the Egyptians, they would be referred to in suitable terms in the agreedcommunique&apos; and it seems likely to be on the basis of such a reference tothem in the communique that the matter will be debated in Parliament.5.        The Committee also considered:-(a) whether and, if so, at what stage the United StatesGovernment should be informed of our intentions in this matter;(b) the timing of our next move in regard to the proposedmultilateral approach to Egypt.As regards (a), the view was expressed, on the one hand, that the Americans,if they were informed of our intentions in advance, were more likely toexercise a disturbing influence on the Egyptians in regard to them than to beof material assistance to us in securing Egyptian agreement to our proposals.On the other hand it was argued that it would be inconsistent with our handling of this matter hitherto if we were to take an initiative of the kind now proposedwithout at least informing the United States Government in advance, and that
failure to do so might well fatally prejudice any chances which remain of ourobtaining American co-operation in the proposed multilateral approach.    If,as was possible, it should be decided to ask the United States Government to lend their support to our final effort to reach agreement with the Egyptiansupon all outstanding points, the communication to be addressed to thern forthis purpose could without difficulty include a suitable reference to the proposedinclusion in the Defence Agreement of undertakings in regard to freedom of navigation through the Canal.    As to (b), the Committee felt that any further move would be better deferred;  if we were to raise the matter again at thisstage with the Americans, and it became known to the Egyptians, it would tendto reinforce rather than to reduce Egyptian suspicions.Availability of the base6.        The Committee examined in detail the draft formula to govern thismatter which was before the Cabinet on 8th September (Annex to C. (53) 249)and which is reproduced as Annex B to this memorandum.    The main point for consideration was whether we should be content with provision for consulta-tion only in the event of an attack on Turkey.    The Committee were informedthat the Turks, although they would be disappointed if the Agreement did not provide for automatic reactivation of the base in such an event, had agreed toleave the matter to our discretion and that it was one over which the egyptians would find it especially difficult to meet us.    In view of the unlikelihood inpractice of an attack on Turkey which did not involve &quot;United Nations action to resist an act of aggression&quot;, the Committee agreed to recommend to theCabinet that the draft formula in Annex 3 should be regarded as beingacceptable to us.Summary of recommendations.        On behalf of the Committee I invite the Cabinet to agreeEreedorn of navigation through the Suez Canal(1)That our Delegation in Cairo should be instructed:&quot;1(a)to secure Egyptian agreement to theinclusion in the preamble to theDefence Agreement of a clause inthe terms reproduced in paragraph above and to indicate to them that we also wish to include a suitable article in the body of the Agreement itself;(b)to report back if they are unable tosecure Egyptian agreement to theinclusion of the proposed clause inthe preamble;(2)That the United States Government should be informed in advance of our intentions under (1) above but thatno further move in regard to the intended multilateralapproach to the Egyptian Government should be madeat this stage.Availability of the base(3)    That the draft formula reproduced in Annex B to thismemorandum should be regarded as beingacceptable to us.Gwydyr House, 3..W. 1.14TH SEPTEMBER, 1953.
