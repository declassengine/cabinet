The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................ITOP SECRET Copy No.C.(53) 28214th OCTOBER, 1953.CABINETEGYPT:   DEFENCE negotiations memorandum by the Minister of Defence.There are two points on General Robertson&apos;s despatchcirculated under cover of C. (53) 281 which raise important issues for theServices.   These are (a) numbers of technicians in the final period;(b) arrangements for withdrawal.At their meeting on 2nd October the Cabinet agreed that theproposals made to the Egyptians in pursuance of the Cabinet decision on16th September represented our final terms for a defence agreement and thatwe were not prepared to make any further concessions (C.C.(53) 54thConclusions, Minute 2).   In these terms were included stipulations that theagreement should last seven years, that full Case A conditions should be preserved throughout, and that a period of 18 months should be allowed for withdrawal.The Final Period2. In the light of the latest discussions with the Egyptians, it seemsvery doubtful whether agreement will be reached unless we are prepared toaccept some variation of the present stipulations.   The choice appears to be between full Case A terms for a shorter duration than seven years and anagreement lasting seven years, but going somewhat below Case A termsduring the final period of the agreement.3. The departments concerned have concluded that the minimumnumber of British personnel required to preserve Case A is 2,500;  this coversboth Army and R.A.F. requirements, and is based on the assumption that duringthe earlier stages of the agreement a sufficient number of Egyptians willhave been trained to replace British personnel who are withdrawn.   I am advised that the prospects of obtaining a duration of seven years would be greatlyincreased if we could accept a.run down below this figure of 2,500 towards theend of the agreement.   The minimum number of British personnel needed toprovide adequate inspection would be about 200 (the R.A.F. would retain inaddition what was needed to maintain its staging facilities) but there is an intermediate stage between this and minimum Case A conditions;  if we couldkeep about 750 British personnel it would be possible to retain technicalcontrol of the base workshops, and provide adequate inspection elsewheresufficient to look after our war reserves.   In addition we should need whatevernumber of R.A.F. personnel must be retained to keep our air stagingfacilities in operation.   It would be our hope that any run down in thenumber of British personnel below 2,500 would be spread over the longestpossible period, but I consider that, if it will tip the balance between a sevenyear agreement and the maximum period which the Egyptians have so far
proposed, our negotiators should be given authority to accept it.   our object would be to ensure that the full number of 4,000 technicians, plus thoseneeded for the R.A.F.ls staging facilities, would remain for the first 4f yearsof the agreement.   I suggest that our negotiators should aim to spread the run down from 4,000 to 2,500 over the next 18 months, so that we did not haveto go below 2,500 until the end of the sixth year.   I suggest that we should authorise our negotiators to accept a run down during the last year from ,500 to 1,000, plus whatever the R.A.F. require, and that in the last resortwe should accept a minimum figure of 750 (plus R.A.F.).Period of Withdrawal4. The second point which requires consideration by the cabinet is the period to be allowed for the withdrawal of troops from Egypt andre-organisation of the Base.   In accordance with their existing instructions,the negotiators have pressed for a period of withdrawal of 18 months fromthe date when the agreement comes into force.   The Delegation now suggestthat in order to reach an agreement with the Egyptians we should accept aperiod of 1 5 months.5.. A period of 1 8 months is needed to carry out the physicalwithdrawal of troops and stores and to provide new accommodation onaustere scales for the joint headquarters in Cyprus and for the troops remaining in the theatre after redeployment.   The essential point is that we should retain enough troops in Egypt until final agreement is reached to enable us tohold our position if negotiations break down.   I understand that the programmeof withdrawal could be arranged so that the first three months of it could beput into effect while satisfying this condition.   There will probably bea period of at least three months between the conclusion of an agreement on principles and ratification of the final agreement.   We could therefore if need be make the reduction to 15 months without prejudicing our position.This would be presented to the Egyptians as a &quot;token&quot; withdrawal,6, To sum up, a decision is required on the following points:-(a)Can we agree that, if it proves essential in order to secure aduration of seven years, the number of British personnel canbe reduced below 2,500 in the last period of the agreement on thelines indicated above, and on the understanding that any such reduction would be limited to the minimum necessary to ensureEgyptian agreement and would also be subject to sufficienttrained Egyptians being available to replace British personnel?(b)Are we willing that, as a token of goodwill and in anticipation ofthe conclusion of a detailed agreement, the first three monthsof the programme for withdrawal of both troops and storesshould be put into effect as soon as agreement in principle hasbeen reached, in which event we could accept a period of 1 5months after ratification of the agreement for the process of withdrawl? ( Withdrawal of troops and dispersal of stores would,of course, have to be made concurrently and any delay in plansaffecting withdrawal of troops would be matched by a similardelay in the plans for dispersal of stores.)A.Ministry of Defence, S.W.1.14th October, 1953.
