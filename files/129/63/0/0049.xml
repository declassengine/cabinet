Printed for the Cabinet. . October 1953CONFIDENTIAL %u ,... Copy No.C. (53) 299 ,23rd October, 1953CABINETDECONTROL OF MEAT AND BACON: FUTURE marketing arrangements    ;Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and FisheriesWe must decide what arrangements are to take the place of the present system for guaranteeing prices to producers of fatstock and for the marketing of fatstockand meat when meat rationing ends.The Choice2.   The broad choice lies between (a) central purchase of fatstock by organised producers under the agricultural marketing Acts, at predetermined fixed prices, followed by resale in a free market.This is essentially what the farmers want. I recommend it though in a form very different from theirs;(b) a return to a free market for fatstock with the farmers&apos; guarantees imple-mented by a deficiency payments scheme supplemented by a &quot; buttress &quot;price arrangement.This is what the meat trades propose and the Minister of Foodrecommends.My Proposals3. Our design must be to meet the legitimate claims of producers, tradersand consumers, while providing for efficient marketing with adequate protection for the Exchequer.4.   My proposals for this are:-(i) The farmers to be given reasonable time i.e., up to midsummer 1955 toestablish a Producers&apos; Marketing Board. This Board would itselfprovide the necessary stability for individual producers by acquiringcompulsorily all animals on a schedule of liveweight prices fixed by it.(ii) Such Producers&apos; Marketing Board to (a) resell the animals alive through auction markets or other channels of trade; except for (b) bacon pigs which it would sell on grade and deadweight to baconfactories; and(c) other stock offered to it voluntarily for sale on a grade and dead-weight basis, so far as facilities allow.(iii) The guarantee under the Agriculture Act to be given by the followingsystem of financial support. For the first year of the Board&apos;s operation the Government would fix beforehand a rate of Exchequer assistancebased upon the deficit incurred by the Ministry of Food in the previous year (see (iv) below) and the level of return thought appropriate. If onthe year&apos;s trading the board with this rate of assistance did better orworse than had been expected the profit or loss would be shared equally45051B
between the Government and the Board. For subsequent years the precise rate of Exchequer assistance would be determined at annual reviews on the basis of previous experience and again with an equalshare of any profit or loss. There would have to be provisions for adjustment of the rate during the year for changes in prices of imported\ : meat and, in the case of pigs, for changes in the general price level of feeding-stuffs (as is now already provided for).(iv) The Ministry of Food to continue purchase of fatstock at fixed prices upto mid-summer 1955 (i.e., for not more than twelve months after theend of rationing). The fatstock would be re-sold by the Ministry ofFood through fatstock auctions re-established on pre-war lines and through other trade channels. Bacon pigs would be paid for as atpresent on a grade and deadweight basis at the bacon factories. imports would be returned to private account except for bacon.(v) After a period (I suggest three years after the Producers&apos; Marketing Boardstarted operations) an inquiry to be initiated into the possible improve-ments in this scheme and into the merits of developing the compulsorygrade and deadweight scheme which is the National Farmers Unions&apos;(N.F.Us.) ultimate objective.Advantages of my proposals.   These are (i) They:(a) set a definite and short-term to the continuation of State trading infatstock;(b) allow the importation of meat (other than bacon) on government account to finish with the end of rationing;(c) provide for reasonable financial arrangements between a Producers&apos;Marketing Board and the Government;(d) postpone any question of compulsory grade and deadweight selling(except for bacon pigs) until we can have a full enquiry with experience of all methods of marketing, including trading by aProducers&apos; Marketing Board.(ii) In substance, they should meet the farmers&apos; wishes organised marketingby producers as a whole, through a Producers&apos; Marketing Board withtrading powers for fatstock, instead of unorganised selling by individuals; and purchase of fatstock from producers at predeterminedfixed prices; (I deal with the N.F.Us.&apos; latest proposals in Appendix I);(iii) At the same time they allow restoration of pre-war businesses, includingauction markets, so that there can be no reasonable accusations of a failure to honour the undertakings to the meat trades;(iv) If the farmers fail to have a Producers&apos; Marketing Board ready to operate under these conditions by the specified date, we should be on strongground in imposing another scheme.(The marketing scheme would have to go through all the usual agricultural marketing Act procedure; we would need to ensure that there were no avoidabledelays on the part of the Government itself).Finance6. No one can foretell the strength or weakness of the market under anyparticular system of selling which has to be adopted after the end of rationing.All that can be said is that the risks for the Exchequer are in any case likely to be greater than at present. How much one system might cost as against any otheris a matter of opinion. In the long-term at any rate my proposals hold out theprospect of a smaller risk to the Exchequer. There is not very much that theindividual producer can do to protect the Exchequer. His ability to hold backstock to meet the market is, in practice, limited. The greatest Exchequer liabilityarises on pigs where the practical possibilities of holding back are least. But a well-conducted Producers&apos; Marketing Board can improve the system of marketing, caninfluence farmers to regulate offerings of stock, and would be better able thanindividual farmers to take stock out of the sales when prices were low. It should,therefore, be able to do better for the producers and for the Exchequer than if all producers were selling their stock individually.
Consumer Choice \    -y. ;,   .r ; ....   ,7. A Producers&apos; Marketing Board buying on grade and predetermined prices would fix its schedule of grades and prices in the lignt of experience of the market;these could be varied at least annually, and take account of seasonal or regionalVariations in requirements. An efficient Board could guide farmers on what toproduce at least as well, probably better, than can the luck or ill luck of localmarkets, or the bargaining powers of dealers or butchers.Pigs8. There are special difficulties about pigs. The N.F.Us. want a Producers&apos;Marketing Board to trade compulsorily in all pigs on a grade and deadweight basis.For the reasons set out in Appendix II I have not felt able to go as far as this.Moreover, such a proposal would arouse strong opposition from the pork trade,backed by the meat trade as a whole. But it is generally agreed that there must at least be organised selling of bacon pigs by grade and deadweight. I have provided for this.Northern Ireland9. Special arrangements will have to be made in Northern Ireland under my proposals, as would be the case under any others.Deficiency Payments and Buttress Price Scheme10. I recognise that the Minister of Food has tried to meet the apprehensions of farmers by the buttress price arrangement. But I am convinced that any schemeinvolving deficiency payments at this moment would meet a violent reaction from farmers all over the country. The reasons are:  (i) memories of pre-war conditions of selling fatstock-where the buyer toooften had too much advantage, (pre-war investigations established thatmarketing methods were unsatisfactory);(ii) the individual farmer would not secure equality of treatment. Equivalentanimals will fetch different prices at different places, or even at differenttimes in the same market on the same day;(iii) farmers will not have that advance knowledge of the price the animal willfetch which is given by a system of fixed prices; and this advanceknowledge alone justifies the large investments required by a high and increasing level of livestock production at present price levels,11. We should be faced with hostility and Joss of confidence amongstfarmers. They would undoubtedly relax their efforts to expand production, andthis would be true not only in the livestock field but generally. In my judgment,the result would certainly be a check to the rate of expansion of agricultural output and there would be a real danger of a fall. But our policy, including recentdecisions to de-control more commodities with their implications for the balance ofpayments, is based on an expanding agriculture.Conclusion * r12. I suggest to my colleagues that there are the strongest reasons for adopt-ing my proposals. Any solution will have its difficulties. I believe that my proposals would not raise difficulties that would outweigh the grave consequences of a break with the farmers which I am convinced the. deficiency payments andbuttress price proposals would cause. At the present time the solution, of this problem of fatstock marketing is regarded by farmers as the critical test of theGovernments policy towards agriculture. . .SffC       .&apos;-/:    &apos;^;V&quot; \&apos;f llfi        t. l. d,-Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, S.W. 1,23rd October, 1953.45051
;; 1.   The latest proposals from the N.F.US; are that-(a) The Ministry of Food should continue to buy fatstock at.fixed prices as:        at present.   But it would then sell on the livestock through private tradeeither at auctions or by private treaty.   If necessary, it would buy in-   : fatstock at reserve prices.   The Ministry of Food would carry all losses,and would get any profit if there was one.(b) Producers would promote a Fatstock Marketing Board which would (i) buy and sell fatstock by grade and deadweight, so far as facilitiesallowed, as an alternative to sale live through the Ministry ofFood;(ii) strengthen the Ministry of Food&apos;s position as a seller by making arrangements on behalf of the Ministry of Food for stock to beretained in lairage or on farms, or to be disposed of through thedeadweight selling scheme, when such stock had been bought inby Ministry of Food at reserve prices;(iii) buy from producers at predetermined fixed prices on grade anddeadweight all fat pigs and sell to bacon factories and the porktrade.(c) There would be an independent inquiry into the whole question of long-term marketing arrangements for fatstock, and the above arrangements should continue for say three years, pending the outcome of the inquiry.2. The special problems in regard to pigs, including criticism of the N.F.Us.&apos;latest proposals, are dealt with in Appendix II.3. The main criticisms of the N.F.Us.&apos; latest proposals for fat cattle and sheep are:  (i) They require continuation of State trading by the Ministry of Food and set no definite limit to this, but envisage continuation for three years.This would be met under the proposals in the Paper which set a term to State trading.(ii) They might involve continued State control over imports, to protect theMinistry of Food&apos;s position as sole seller of fatstock in the market.This would not arise under the proposals in the Paper since theMinistry of Food would only be trading in home-produced fatstock fora short period, and thereafter the financial arrangements with the producers&apos; Marketing Board would reduce the risk to one of the same order as would arise under a deficiency payments and buttress pricescheme.   1(iii) Fixed prices to producers on a schedule determined a year ahead mightnot reflect actual market trends or not reflect them sufficientlyquickly and might not give the producer any incentive to adjust thetime of sending forward his stock (so far as is practicable) so as to makethe most of the local market variations; Ministry of Food wouldhave to accept the stock at the seasonal prices previously fixed, what-ever the state of the local market.. A Producers&apos; Marketing Board under the arrangements proposedin the Paper would be in a far stronger position than the Governmentto adjust seasonal and grade price scales to fit consumer demand asreflected through the market. The Board would also be better able toarrange for the regulation of the flow of stock by arranging for themto be held on farms where market prices were temporarily depressed.For reasons given in the Paper this system might be less expensive tothe Exchequer than a, deficiency payments and buttress price scheme.(iv) Producers might be tempted to sell beasts for slaughter outside the- Ministry of Food&apos;s channels when the market was strong and it waspossible to get more than the Ministry of Food&apos;s scheduled prices; if-      APPENDIX ILatest N.F.U. Proposals
stock were only offered to the Ministry of Food when market prices were at or below the schedule of fixed prices, these would become ineffect high support prices and the Exchequer liability would be con-siderably increased.Under the proposals in the Paper a Producers&apos; Marketing board would be in a much stronger position than the Government to policearrangements of this kind: the financial arrangements between theGovernment and the Board would give it an incentive to make thescheme work.(v) The N.F.Us.&apos; proposals contemplate that all costs and all losses would beborn by the Exchequer, although if there were any profits (which is unlikely except in the case of beef) the Exchequer would get them.The financial arrangements proposed in the Paper between theGovernment and the Board would provide a strong incentive for theBoard to operate as efficiently as possible at all times.APPENDIX IIPigsThe N.F.Us. proposals contemplate that a Producers&apos; Marketing Board shouldbuy all pigs on a grade and deadweight basis and resell either to bacon factoriesor the pork trade.2. There are the following criticisms of such a proposal as regards porkpigs:-(a) The pork trade is a difficult one with widely varying consumer preferences,which a central authority trading on grade and deadweight would find it difficult to satisfy.(b) Although pork pigs are sold on deadweight there is no grading at presentand no-one has yet devised satisfactory grading standards for pork pigs.(c) It is doubtful whether facilities for the selling of pork pig carcases by a central authority would be available; a substantial proportion of thepigs might therefore have to be sold live in any case, at least for sometime to come.3. For these reasons, I do not propose that all pigs should be sold on gradeand deadweight.4. There is, however, general agreement that bacon pigs should all be boughton grade and deadweight. It is therefore proposed in the paper that the Producers&apos;Marketing Board should pay on a grade and deadweight basis for all pigs boughtfor bacon curing, reselling them to the bacon factories. Such an arrangement is muchto be preferred to long-term individual contracts and a regulatory board, whichpre-war experience showed to be unsatisfactory. A trading board with a financial interest in results would have a strong incentive to improve quality necessaryabove all in bacon pigs. The bacon factories would favour such an arrangement.It could not validly be criticised by the meat trade, who would not be greatlyaffected.
