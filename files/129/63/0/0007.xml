secret.(53) 25715TH SEPTEMBER, 1953-CABIN tl   Or. .RE GO KM oui i         copy no. 6 7CABINETEGYPT:  DEFENCE negotiations memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilMy colleagues will have seen the report of the Cabinet Committee which met under the Chairmanship of the Lord Privy Seal (C. (53) 254).2.        I hope that my colleagues will agree to accept the Committee &apos;srecommendations in regard to the formula for the availability of the base and inregard to the insertion in our Agreement with the Egyptians of a reference to theneed for preserving the principle of freedom of navigation through the suez canal.3.        There remains the question how we should instruct our Delegation toproceed in regard to the duration of the Agreement and the numbers oftechnicians to be retained for purposes of maintaining the base.    Up to now wehave never gone below ten years, and the Egyptians have never gone abovefive years.    It has been intimated to us through the Americans that the egyptians might be willing to go as far as six years.    General Robertson doesnot consider, and on the information available I agree with him, that the egyptians can be got to accept a ten-year Agreement.4.        I understand that General Robertson believes he could obtain six-and-a-half years and that in certain circumstances the Egyptians might be induced toaccept a seven-year Agreement made up of -(a) eighteen months for withdrawal of combatanttroops;(b) three further years with 4,000 technicians;(c) two-and-a-half years with a smaller numberof technicians and inspectors.5.        I am not prepared to recommend that we go as low as six- and-a-half years, but I think that we should instruct the Delegation to put their proposalfor a seven-year Agreement as stated above to the Egyptians.6,        If we are to go for a seven-year Agreement, we must try to enlistgeneral American support, or at the very least prevent them raising false hopeswith the Egyptians.    I would therefore propose to instruct H, M. ambassador in Washington to tell the United States Government that we could not go below-1-
seven years, that this would be our last word on the subject, and that we count on their using their influence to bring about an Agreement.    I would also speak to the U.3, Ambassador here.     In this way, the U. 3. Ambassador in Cairowould not be in a position to offer the Egyptians any hope of obtaining further concessions from us.7.        I would propose to communicate in somewhat similar terms with theGovernments of India, Pakistan and Iraq, who have all expressed interest inour negotiations and hinted that we might split the difference between ten and five years.Foreign Office, S, &apos;W. 1.15TH SEPTEMBER, 1953.
