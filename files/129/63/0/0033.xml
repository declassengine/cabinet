Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1953SECRET Copy No.   g *fC. (S3) 28315th October, 1953CABINETTARIFF POLICY: NO-NEW-PREFERENCE RULEMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade at their meeting on 25th August (C.C. (53) 50th Conclusions, Minute 8) theCabinet approved proposals for enlisting United States support for a modificationof the rule of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) prohibiting the increase of margins of preference. The line of approach envisaged a generalwaiver applicable to all goods for which we have not until now made any tariff concessions to &quot; bind &quot; rates of duty, subject to a requirement to consult with other foreign. countries interested in the item affected as to the risk, if any, that anincrease in the margin of preference might lead to a substantial diversion of trade from these countries to Commonwealth sources of supply.2. In C. (53) 265 I gave my colleagues a short account of my visit to Genevafor the opening stages of the Session of the Contracting Parties to the GeneralAgreement at which I introduced our proposal for a modification of the no-new-preference rule. My colleagues will recall that we need this waiver in order togive effect to the decisions which we took last year to increase certain protective duties on horticultural products. Our case for a waiver does not rest solely, how-ever, upon the horticultural tariff problem since it is clear that we must regainthe right to increase any protective duties on which we have not undertaken specificcommitments, should circumstances show that it is necessary to do so in the interestsof United Kingdom industries.3. The proposal is at present being strongly opposed by several european countries. Their principal purpose in opposing us is to prevent us raising any duty even in cases where we are under no tariff obligation to hold it at the existingrate. They claim that if we ask for a waiver at all it should be limited to each individual case as it arises. It by no means follows that we should get individualwaivers and to adopt this approach would place us in a wholly untenable position..It would mean, in practice, that before we could increase any duty, even though&quot; unbound,&quot; we should have to negotiate with the interested foreign countries onthe rates. Politically, especially in view of the recent discussions on the GeneralAgreement at the Conservative Party Conference, we must, at the least, be clearlyseen to be free to raise our &quot; unbound &quot; duties on goods in which commonwealth countries have no substantial trade.4. There is a considerable risk that we shall not obtain at Geneva the waiverwhich we seek. Even the United States, with whom we agreed our proposalsbeforehand, may not support us if the opposition of the European countries is too strong.5. I am opposed to making any further concessions of substance to meetthe points of view expressed by the Europeans. We have already gone a long way towards meeting every reasonable request, particularly in the matter of providingsafeguards against diversion of trade from foreign to Commonwealth sources.6.  We must decide in advance what policy we are to follow if we do not obtain the waiver. Failure to obtain the waiver will arouse criticism in this country45018
and, if we are not prompt in announcing how we propose to meet the new situation,any decision which we ultimately make will seem to have been dictated by our critics.7. In the event of the waiver being refused there are three ways in which wecould give protection not only to the horticulturists in this country, whose provencase for increased duties is the immediate cause of our seeking the waiver, butalso to any other industry which may later be able to establish a case for increasedprotection. The three courses* are:  (1) to introduce legislation to impose duties on imports from the Common-wealth so that we would be able to increase the duties on the foreignimports in question without infringing the rule against increasedpreferences;(2) to leave the duties as they are; but to provide whatever measure ofprotection  we think  appropriate in  these cases by retaining  orre-imposing quota restrictions on imports;(3) to increase the duties to the level considered necessary after full examina-tion while refraining from imposing corresponding increases on theCommonwealth.8. Of these courses I regard the first as out of the question for the simplereason that no such Bill would carry the support of a majority in Parliament. Wehave not hitherto been prepared to introduce legislation to impose duties on importsfrom the Commonwealth. A fortiori, we cannot do so now when our reasonablerequest has been rejected by the European countries and when the feeling in favourof Imperial Preference has been strongly expressed at the Party Conference.9. An attempt might be made to solve the problem by using quota restrictions.In my judgment such a course is open to very strong objection. First, these quotaswould be openly applied for protective purposes and would be in contravention ofthe spirit of the General Agreement and difficult in many cases to defend,. evenaccording to the letter of the Agreement. Secondly, we have repeatedly told, theNational Farmers&apos; Unions and others that it is our policy to protect producers bytariffs and not by quotas and the farmers themselves strongly favour the change from quotas to tariffs. They have learned from experience that the quota methodis clumsy and inefficient and it has been under constant criticism. These attackswould be considerably strengthened if it were known that the only reason for keeping quotas was to comply with a highly technical ruling of the G.A.T.T.Thirdly, we should be pressed to say what our policy was in relation to any otherindustry which might submit a tariff application in the future. We should be forcedto say either that we were unable to protect the industry in question or that wewould maintain quotas or reintroduce them, as the case might be, in order to giveprotection. We should thus find ourselves driven inevitably into an overall policyof quota restrictions for industries requiring protection. This would mean a reversal of the commercial policy which this country has followed since the war andwhich is the only commercial policy to make sense for a country living by its exporttrade. Finally, if we had to admit that the General Agreement continued to deprive us of all power to increase our duties, we should encounter such politicaland public reactions as might force us to withdraw from the General Agreement.10. For this reason, I have come to the conclusion that, if our waiver isrefused, our best indeed our only policy is to increase the duties on the horticulture-cultural products in question without imposing corresponding duties on the virtuallynon-existent imports of comparable Commonwealth products, and to announce thiscourse of action to the Contracting Parties at Geneva immediately after the vote on the waiver has gone against us. I wish to emphasise that the raising of theduties as such is in no sense a breach of the G.A.T.T. They are not bound at theirexisting rates by any tariff agreement. It would be the failure to impose corres-ponding duties on comparable Commonwealth products which would be open to challenge by any of the Contracting Parties. I doubt, however, whether theEuropean countries concerned would be seriously surprised or dismayed by the raising of the duties.   Indeed, for the European Governments the problem is* Theoretically there is a fourth course-namely, - pending &apos; a&apos; review of the G.A.T.T., tocontent ourselves with individual waivers, beginning with.horticultural products. For the reasonsset out in paragraph 3 there seems to be no point in pursuing this.
primarily presentational; they are not afraid so much of the possible effect on their trade the effect of removing the quotas, even though accompanied by a rise in tariffs, might even be favourable to them as of having to answer the accusationfrom their horticultural producers that they have unnecessarily consented to ourincreasing the duties against them. Moreover, we have the basis of a good moralcase for taking direct action. We could say to the Contracting Parties that wehave put forward to them a reasonable and moderate case for a technical amend-ment which would give us limited freedom from the rule against increasedpreferences, with safeguards to deal with the possibility of an increase in dutiescausing a substantial diversion of trade; and that our request has been refused, not because it went against the spirit of the rule against increased preferences, but because those who would not vote for our proposal wished to keep us in the trapwhere we alone of all the parties to the G.A.T.T. found ourselves stopped fromraising &quot; unbound &quot; duties.11. We would then leave it to the European countries to make use, if they wished, of those procedures of the General Agreement which allow for retaliatorymeasures against those who default in their obligations. We could point outinformally to foreign Governments that any action, short of that proposed above,would be regarded by public opinion in this country as so inadequate that weshould be forced to leave the G.A.T.T.12. I ask for the approval of my colleagues to taking the course suggested inparagraphs 10 and 11 in the event of the waiver being withheld from us by the contracting Parties.P.
