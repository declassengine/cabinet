SECRET(53) 26630th SEPTEMBER, 1953.CAOiN,:. ,   Or rRECORD COP1CABINETCOPY NO. x-ueJUDGES&apos; REMUNERATION BILEMemorandum by the Lord Chancellor,the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Secretary of State for scotland on 30th July the Cabinet invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer tosubmit for their consideration a draft of a Bill to increase the gross salaries ofthe Judges of the Superior Courts by  3,000 (C.C.(53) 47th Conclusions, Minute 5),2.The attached Bill has been prepared in consultation between us.3. As requested by the Cabinet it includes, provisionally, a formula for making the increase retrospective to the beginning of the current financial year.While it is true that the case for an increase is long overdue, and the Judges were greatly disappointed over the failure of the Bill introduced last March, we areagainst making the Bill retrospective.   It seems hardly worth while making thepassage of the Bill more difficult for the sake of a few months&apos; increase insalaries which have been unchanged all these years.4. The Bill as drafted represents a compromise between twoconflicting requirements.iIt could be a very short Bill saying that the existing salaries of the judges are each to go up by  3,000, their pensions remaining unaffected, and giving statutory cover for the allowances payable to English High Court Judgesacting as Commissioners.A short and simple Bill in this form would have obvious attractionsand the Secretary of State for Scotland would have preferred it as a means of limiting the possibility of controversy over the question of parity between english and Scottish salaries.   But since Parliament will no doubt expect to be able tosee plainly what each of the new salaries is to be it has seemed to us better on thewhole that they should appear in the Bill itself.There might be advantage in doing this by means of a Schedulecontaining specific amendments of each of the relevant statutes.   Provisions aboutsalaries (and pensions) are contained in a great many Acts some of which have been amended more than once;  and such a Schedule, necessarily rather long, might help to clarify the position.   On the whole, however, we have thought it better to forgothis advantage in order to keep the form of the Bill as simple as possible.5. We remind the Cabinet that they decided to defer a decision on thequestion whether the Bill should be mentioned in The Queen&apos;s Speech at the Openingof Parliament until a draft had been before them.   The Lord Chancellor is very anxious that it should be mentioned in the Sj)eech, and thinks that there may befurther disappointment among the Judges unless it is made plain at the beginning ofthe new Session that the Government intend to increase judicial salaries withoutfurther delay.SIMONDS29th September, 1953.

SECRETJudges&apos; Remuneration BillEXPLANATORY AND  FINANCIAL memorandum. Clause 1 (1) increases by  3,000 in each case the salaries ofcertain high judicial offices in England, Scotland and NorthernIreland.
