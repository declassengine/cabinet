(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER  BRITANNIC -MAJESTY*3 GOVERNMENT)secret.(53) 278 COPY N6.   .      &apos;13TH OCTOBER, 1953CABINETCOTTONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster and Minister of MaterialsThe question of the opening of the Futures Market of the LiverpoolCotton Exchange ought to be settled without further delay.2.        This question has been under intensive discussion with the spinnersand with the Liverpool Cotton Association for over six months.    ThroughoutLancashire the cotton industry is expecting the Government to come to an early decision to permit the market to re-open next year,3.        The Liverpool Cotton Market was the only truly international market in cotton.    It was closed during the war; the last Government refused to allowit to be opened.    The Prime Miinister, speaking in Liverpool on the eve of theElection, promised that if we returned we would open it.    In &quot;Britain strong and Free&quot; we gave a pledge to re-open this market,4,        The Raw Cotton Commission is now dealing in only 44 per cent of thecotton consumed - next year it would be less - but, in the absence of a futuresmarket, is providing hedging facilities for the whole industry - at the risk ofpublic funds.    We have declared in Parliament that as a matter of public policy this cannot continue.5,        The Raw Cotton Commission depends on the support and confidence of the trade, for which it must be able to retain the services of competent staff.It can no longer do so, since the majority of the trade have shown that theyprefer to buy their cotton through free enterprise, and the staff are naturallylooking to their own future.    The Chairman has decided to resign and the best of the staff are seeking permanent places in the industry,6,        I do not believe that it is now possible for us to maintain an effectiveRaw Cotton Commission,7.       The Chancellor of the Exchequer is concerned about the dollar risk.There will be some risks.    There is, however, another risk.    Now, enough of the people who have expertise of this difficult market are still available;the spinners who use it are anxious for the step to be taken.    We have, there-fore, the opportunity of re &quot;opening this great international market, and it isrny judgment that postponement would involve the risk that the opportunitymight never recur,W.Ministry of Materials, S, W.1,12TH OCTOBER, 1953.
