(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE-PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY-&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret. (53) 30026th OCTOBER, 1953.cabinet general AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE:EIGHTH session memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.The meeting of the Contracting Parties of the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) ended on 24th October.  As I have already had to trouble my colleagues on a number of occasions with submissions about subjectsunder discussion at the meeting, I will confine this paper to a brief reportof the outcome on four main questions under review.General Review of the G.A.T.T.2. There was general agreement that this could not be undertaken, inany realistic way, until the autumn of next year.   Whether in fact a comprehensive review can take place then must depend on what happens in the U.S.A, afterthe Randall Commission has reported.   It will be surprising, in my view, ifmatters are sufficiently advanced to enable a review to take place next autumn.f   &apos;copy NO. KQ jLJapanese application for provisional association.3. . The original proposal for the provisional association of Japan withthe G.A.T.T, was not proceeded with because it was feared that the necessary two-thirds majority might not be secured for it,   A resolution was put forwardinstead providing for a protocol under which Japan and the countries signingit would undertake to treat each other as if Japan were a member of the G.A.T.T.As the Lord Privy Seal informed the Cabinet on 22nd October, the australian government rejected the proposal that we should accept a compromise resolution;and the Cabinet accordingly agreed that the United Kingdom delegation shouldabstain when the vote was taken (C,C.(53) 60th Conclusions, Minute 6).4. The resolution was adopted on 23rd October:   seven countries -the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Southern Rhodesia (of whosestand we were confident) and also South Africa, Czechoslovakia and Burma*abstained from voting.The No&quot;New-Preference Waiver .-5. We had to face continuous difficulties on this, due almost wholly tosuspicion of our intentions in the European countries, and particularly thoselike France, Italy, Denmark and Holland which would be affected by the impositionof protective tariffs on horticultural products.   Right up to 22nd October therewas a serious risk that we should not get the requisite majority for a waiver or that, even if it were not rejected, no European country of importance would vote for it.   But on 22nd October a compromise v/as put forward modifying incertain respects the form of the waiver (to our disadvantage).   I felt able, however* Burma registered a vote in favour 24 hours later when her instructionsarrived.
liol&amp;.NDto accept this, and on 24th October it was endorsed by the Contracting Parties.The voting on this question was twenty-six in our favour, with seven abstentions:there were no adverse votes.   The countries abstaining were France, Italy,Denmark, Holland, Czechoslovakia, Indonesia and Burma.6, The effect of this waiver is that we are given a general dispensationfrom any obligation to impose duties on Commonwealth goods in cases where weimpose or raise most-favoured-nation duties on foreign goods in order toprotect United Kingdom industries;  but we have had to accept, on two points,a certain stiffening of the procedures for consultation with other countries and subsequent administration of the waiver.   First, if the Contracting parties should rule in an arbitration that the widening of a preference margin whichwould follow a given increase of duty would be likely to result in a substantialdiversion of trade from foreign to Commonwealth producers, the waiver willnot apply and there will be no escape clause for us.   Secondly, if in arbitrationthe Contracting Parties should rule that such diversion, though not likely,is nevertheless possible, the waiver will cease to apply if a Contracting Partycan prove at a later date that a substantial diversion of trade has in fact takenplace.   If, however, the countries concerned, or the arbitration tribunal, give us a &quot;green light&quot;, the waiver will apply unconditionally.7. This is admittedly a less clear-cut and favourable outcome than we had hoped for.   But cubject to procedural difficulties it will enable us tointroduce tariff changes without having to impose duties on Commonwealth goods and without having to act in breach of the G.A.T.T. As we have consistentlysaid that we had no intention of creating a diversion of trade in favour of theCommonwealth but only of protecting United Kingdom industries, it is logicallydifficult to refuse to accept procedures designed to guard against any suchdiversion.   Everything will depend on how the procedure works in practice   -and the United Kingdom delegation, on my instructions, were at pains to emphasisethis in acknowledging the vote on the waiver.The extension of the time-bar on the re-negotiation of &quot;bound&quot; duties.8, The Contracting Parties formally agreed that there should be afurther extension for eighteen months after 31st December next of the period within which there could not be re-negotiation of &quot;bound&quot; tariffs.   In accordancewith the Cabinet decision of 25th August (C.C.(53) 50th Conclusions, Minute 8)this was supported by the United Kingdom Delegation.9. I propose to make a short statement in the House after questions on 27th October, reporting on the four questions dealt with above.   I haveagreed the terms of this statement with the Foreign Secretary and theChancellor of the Exchequer.P.T.Board of Trade, S.W.I.26th October, 1953.
