The issues relevant to the restoration of University representation are(a) plural voting and (b) number of seats.A. Plural Voting3. The Speakers Conference in 1944 recommended the retention of Universityrepresentation as it then existed, with plural voting.4.   The objections to restoring plural voting now are that (a) This would be generally regarded as a retrograde step;(b) Probably about two-thirds of our supporters in the House of Commons are opposed to either plural voting or the restoration of the Universityseats or both.(c) The Labour Party attached great importance to the principle of one manone vote, and would be bound to abolish plural voting again at thefirst opportunity.5. In our view these objections are so formidable that the restoration of university representation with provision for plural voting has to be ruled out.6. The alternative to a system of plural voting would be to make everygraduate choose between a University vote and a vote in a territorial constituency.The result would not be representation of the Universities but only of a haphazardassortment of graduates, many of them people who live in constituencies where their votes cannot affect the result of an election. A further effect might be to makeuncertain and unrepresentative the results in certain marginal constituencies inwhich large numbers of University graduates live. For these reasons we would notconsider such an arrangement satisfactory; but if we rule out both plural votingand the alternative of making the elector choose between a University and a constituency vote we cannot restore University representation in the Houseof Commons at all.44947Printed for the Cabinet.

B. Number of Seats7. It seems difficult to justify restoring a seat for 12,000 electors in Walesor for 7,000 in Northern Ireland.  If, however, these two contituencies were to be,; combined with others we should produce groups that would be totally unacceptable.:- And the problem would not end there. It might be argued that the electorates of university constituencies should bear some approximation to the smallestgeographical constituencies. To achieve this, however, we should not only haveto combine Wales and Northern Ireland with other Universities; we should also have to combine London with other Universities. If, for example, we reduce thenumber of University seats to six we should have to create constituencies consistingof Universities with no close association with one another either geographically or inother ways and we should give great offence to all of them. On the whole, therefore,we feel that if the University seats are to be restored we must restore them as theywere before they were abolished, in which case we shall be faced with the objection that we are, particularly if we do not have plural voting, creating constituencieswith,indefensibly small electorates.1 C. Alternative8. The practical choice, as we see it, is between restoring University repre-sentation in a grossly unsatisfactory form or abandoning our pledge to restore itin&apos;th*e;House of Commons.9. The question whether the Universities should be represented in a reformed house of Lords, possibly by a number of Vice-Chancellors elected by all the Vice-Chancellors, is a matter for the Committee on the House of Lords. We ourselvestake the view that this would be regarded by many as a partial implementing ofour pledge, although the contrary view is held. A possible objection is that ifspecial provision were to be made for University representation in the House ofLords it would become impossible to resist demands for representation by other special interests such as the Church of Scotland or the Nonconformist Churches.Nevertheless, we feel that the possibility is one which ought to be explored. Thecase for giving the Universities special treatment in the House of Lords seems asstrong on historical grounds as for giving them special treatment in the Commons.In so far as University representation is intended to enable the representatives ofthe Universities to make their special contribution to the discussion of the nation&apos;saffairs, there appears to be no reason why they should not make it as well in the lords as in the Commons. There would also appear to be rather less risk of asettlement on these lines being upset after any future change of Government.D. M. F.J. S.2nd October, 1953.
