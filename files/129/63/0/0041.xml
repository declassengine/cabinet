(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY-&apos;S-government-)CONFIDENTIAL/      IC.(53) 291 COPY NO.17th OCTOBER, 1953.CABINETCERTIFICATION AND DETENTION OF MENTAL PATIENTSMemorandum by the Minister of HealthThere is at present a good deal of disquiet about the operation of thelaw relating to the certification and detention of persons suffering from mental illness or mental defect.   Questions are already on the Order Paper reflectinguneasiness with the present position and asking whether it is proposed to holdan enquiry into the operation of the existing law.   We are likely to be pressed for a Debate in the House.2. This disquiet has been occasioned by a number of Press articles and the conclusions drawn in these from particular cases have not been well founded.   Yet for some time I have had no doubt that the present law needssubstantial alteration to bring it into line with modern thought and development.It also needs codification and amendment to remove the many anomalies arisingfrom the passing of the National Health Service Act and the placing ofresponsibility for institutional care and treatment on the Minister of Health,acting through Hospital Boards and Committees.3. The whole subject is a complex and difficult one.   I could submit tomy colleagues in due course proposals for an amending Bill,   But the liberty of the subject is involved and during the passage of the Bill controversy wouldrange over the whole field of the powers and procedure for making detentionorders and the powers of discharge.   Because of this and because the functions and administration of Government Departments and other bodies in relationthereto come under review, it would clearly be advantageous if any measurecontemplating substantial amendments of the law could be founded on therecommendations of an independent body of enquiry.   This was the course adoptedbefore the introduction of the Mental Deficiency Act, 1913, and the MentalTreatment Act, 1930.4, I therefore ask the Cabinet to agree that, particularly as in any case it will be a year or more before we can introduce legislation, a Royal commission should be appointed to review the law as it affects the certification and detention of those who suffer from mental disorder or defect.   In that event I consider it important that an announcement of the proposal to appoint a Royal commission should be made as soon as possible after the House meets.   The Home AffairsCommittee, who considered the matter this morning, were in agreement with my views (H.A,(53) 21st Meeting, Minute 5).5, The following terms of reference for such a Royal commission have been agreed by the Lord Chancellor, the Home Secretary and the FinancialSecretary, Treasury:-&quot;To enquire as regards England and Wales into the existing law andadministrative machinery governing the certification, detention, care (otherthan hospital care or treatment under the National Health Service Acts,
1946=52), trial or licence, discharge and supervision of personswho are or are alleged to be suffering from mental illness ormental defect, other than Broadmoor patients;To consider as regards England and Wales the extent to whichit is now, or should be made, statutorily possible for such persons to be treated without certification;And to make recommendations.&quot;I.M.Ministry of Health, W. 1.16th October, 1953.
