Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1953CONFIDENTIALC. (53) 26729th September, 1953CABINETICELAND FISHERIES dispute memorandum by the Lord President, the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of Agriculture and FisheriesWe think that our colleagues would like to know how matters stand.2. It will be remembered that, as a result of the Cabinefs decision on May 14(C.C. (53) 31st Conclusions, Minute 7), the Icelandic Minister in London was informed on May 20 that Her Majesty&apos;s Government were unable to put forwardany further suggestions for a settlement of the dispute over fishery limits. Theywere, however, willing to consider at any time any constructive proposals which the icelandic Government might suggest. A statement on similar lines was made in theHouse of Commons by the Minister of State.3.   Since then there have been the following developments:  (a) the result of the general election in Iceland has been to strengthen the coalition of Conservative and Progressive parties and to dispose of the fear that the Communists might profit from the dispute. M. OlafurThors has become Prime Minister in the new Government whileremaining Minister of Fisheries;(b) Her Majesty&apos;s Minister at Reykjavik was recently instructed to ascertain whether there was any truth in rumours, originating with the Icelandicvice-consul at Grimsby, that Iceland might be prepared to make concessions, but M. Thors made it clear that the Icelandic Governmentwere not prepared to modify, or even to discuss, the fishery limits whichare in dispute;(c) the Icelanders have had some success in finding alternative markets, butthey are clearly anxious to get back into the British fish market, and atthe port of Grimsby, their customary centre.4. At Grimsby, Mr. George Dawson, in pursuance of his agreement withIcelandic trawling interests, has been making arrangements, to sell Icelandic-caughtfish in defiance of the British fishing industry&apos;s ban. He has met with some initialdifficulties, but seems to be almost ready to handle Icelandic-caught fish there.5. For their part, the Federation of British Trawler Officers, representing 1,400skippers and mates at the main trawling ports of Grimsby, Hull, Fleetwood andAberdeen, have said that if and when Icelandic-caught fish is landed, &quot; we shallapproach the trawler-owners and ask them to agree not to sell any [British-caught]fish to any merchant who purchases or handles this Icelandic-caught fish.&quot; this statement is said to supersede the federation^ decision at an earlier stage to takecounter-action by way of a stoppage of British trawlers.6. Supplies of fish in the British market have so far been plentiful and portprices on the whole moderate. The season of shorter supplies is approaching, butBritish distant water trawler owners are restricting catches because of lesseneddemand and these restrictions could be eased to meet any shortage.44913\j t\ U ! i S --- &apos;      \J &apos;.l   &apos; vRECORD copy copy No.
7. We think it is clear that Her Majesty&apos;s Government have no occasion to -intervene in the dispute between Mr. Dawson and British fishing interests. Wehave taken the position that, though the ban is to be deplored, it does not con-travene the law. If, then, it is broken by Mr. Dawson we shall not be embarrassed;equally, if Mr. Dawson fails, either because merchants will not buy from him or he cannot make the venture pay, Her Majesty&apos;s Government are not involved; we canthen see whether the Icelandic Government maintain their refusal to discuss ornegotiate modifications of the fishery limits.8.   We conclude, therefore, that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should take no action for the moment but should await developments.S.J. S.T. L. D.23rd September, 1953.
