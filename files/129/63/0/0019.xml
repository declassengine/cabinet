3. (53) 269NO.30th SEPTEMBER, 1953.CABINETWHITE PAPER ON HOUSING policy memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer have read with great interest the lord Erivy Seal&apos;s paper C. (53) Z64circulating amendments to the White Paper on Housing Policy, and the Ministerof Housing&apos;s paper C. (53) 259 recommending that the maximum repairs increase should be twice instead of one and a half times the statutory deduction.2. I have one or two comments on the White Paper which stem from itstheme and title, with which I entirely agree - &quot;Housing *&quot; A Comprehensive Policy&quot;.I hope the White Paper will be genuinely comprehensive and that we shall not find afterwards that we have left out of our statement things which the ordinaryman would consider form part of a comprehensive policy, or that we havenot gone far enough.3. First, I agree with the Minister -of housing s conclusion on the maximumrepairs increase.4. Second, in spite of what the Minister says, I think we must make some reference to the housing subsidies.   I do not want to go into detail, but to omit a reference entirely would be too glaring.   We should probably be questionedabout it, but if we were not, it would be assumed that we had no change in view.Therefore I suggest that we should say a little more than now appears inparagraph 91, perhaps as follows:-&quot;Any increase in private enterprise house building, whether forletting or for sale, would in some measure lighten the ever-growingburden of housing subsidies, which in the interest of the general bodyof taxpayers cannot continue indefinitely at the present rate.   her majesty&apos;s Government consider that the proposals set out in this paper introduce new factors which will have to be taken into account in a future review.5. Lastly, I think we ought to say something, however slight, aboutemergency housing.   It is rather different from the theme of the rest of the paper,but anything which called itself a comprehensive housing policy would have tocover it.   The Minister of Housing, I understand, has proposals ready.   They would need legislation and would fit well into the Bill which he now contemplates.   I hopethey will be fitted in:  if we leave it to a later Bill, obviously the chances of winding up an expensive service, which brings us under constant fire from the public accounts Committee, will be delayed.   I do not want to anticipate the Minister&apos;sproposals to his colleagues, but I hope they may be brought forward early and thata brief reference may be made in the White Paper to the fact that he expects to v/indup the system in the near future.   If nothing is said in the White Paper about it,it might cause some surprise if we put it into the Bill.R.A.3.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.30th September, 1953.
