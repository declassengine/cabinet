secret.(53) 297 COPY NO.   %iS&amp;*J22nd OCTOBER, 1953.CABINETHOUSE OF LORDS REFORM:  PROGRESS report memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilLast June I was reluctantly obliged, owing to other work which ithad been necessary for me to undertake, to ask my colleagues on this Committeeto put off further meetings until October.   But I promised the- Cabinet that Iwould let them know,   in the meantime, the results of our discussions andresearches so far.   That is the purpose of this paper.   I should add that in some important respects the Minister of Supply did not share the general view:  hisreservations will be further considered by the Committee when it meets again.2, It is generally felt that, if the House of Lords is to be a realbulwark against extremist action, it must be reformed as soon as possible.   Thatthe consequences of inaction are likely to be far more serious now than 40 yearsago is, we believe, common ground in all responsible quarters.   The dangerof far-reaching action by a Government with a temporary majority in the Houseof Commons is more real than it was then.   Moreover, in any case, a purelyhereditary Second Chamber, with only 36 per cent, of the members attendingten times or more during a whole Session, cannot be justified today.   If theHouse of Lords is to survive at all, something must be done to bring it more into line with modern ideas.3. We think that the new House should be limited to a figure of from300 to 400 members, and that it should be composed partly of hereditary peers and partly of life peers.   The question whether or not it should be open to women is one on which no final views have yet been formed.4. We have not found any substantial difficulty over the introductionof the principle of life peers.   It is evident that this would put at the disposalof the country many eminent men who could not, for various reasons, accepthereditary peerages.   On the whole, on a preliminary examination, it seems tous that the scheme of nomination of life peers by the Prime Minister of theday, as recommended by the Party Leaders&apos; Conference of 1948, is probably the best method.   The first nomination would be based upon lists submittedby the Party Leaders.5, It is over the hereditary peerage that the main trouble arises.We are agreed that a hereditary element in the House of Lords ought to beretained, but that there must be a substantial reduction in the number of hereditary peers.   The idea of hereditary peers sitting by virtue of an additionalqualification, e.g. a Privy Councillorship, which formed the basis of theproposals on which the Conservative Party went into action in 1948, no longerfinds universal support in the Committee.   Apart from everything else, it hasthe practical disadvantage of not providing a supply of young hereditary peersas back-benchers.   Moreover, it was never popular with the Conservative Partyin the House of Lords, and would probably not be acceptable to them now.
ISO6. We are examining the possibility of giving the hereditary peerageas a whole the right to elect a certain number of representative peers -possibly 100 - as members of the reformed House.   This is in substance theexisting Scottish scheme, which works well for the comparatively small numberof peers affected, and it seems likely to be the scheme most acceptable to theHouse of Lords itself:  for Peers who will no longer be able to sit in parliament will at any rate know that they retain the right to choose their representatives.But to ensure that such a scheme would receive adequate support fromConservative peers to make it worth pursuing, I and the other members of theCommittee who are also members of the House of Lords are to take soundingsconfidentially among a few leading Conservative peers now that parliament has met again.7. It should however he said that, even if there is support for a house on these lines, there are likely to be a number of practical difficulties in theway of any general application of the Scottish model. For example, we mustdevise arrangements(1) to ensure adequate representation of Labour;(2) to provide for fair representation of Scotland, Northern Irelandand Wales (the Act of Union makes the Scottish problemparticularly delicate);(3) to secure that the most suitable peers stand a good chance of being elected, in spite of the fact that many of them may not bepersonally known to a considerable number of their fellows;(4) to ensure that the period of service of an elected peer in the newHouse shall neither be too long nor too short.Various proposals for getting over these practical difficulties are at present under examination.8. The Law Lords are an essential feature of any Second Chamber,and they would presumably all continue to sit.   In a smaller Chamber, however,the numbers of Spiritual Peers might have to be reduced.   The election of acertain number of Spiritual Peers by their own number seems a possible solution.9. Much may depend upon the result of the informal and confidentialconsultations which I and my colleagues are to have with leading peers in thepresent House.   If progress along the lines I have described seems unlikely, weshall have to give further consideration to other schemes.   It will be recollectedthat Lord Simon has already introduced a Bill providing for the creation of notmore than ten Life Peers a year.   This may be better than nothing;  but it doesnot of course touch the major problem of the &quot;backwoodsmen&quot;.   In an alternative scheme that he has put forward. Lord Exeter has strongly urged a scheme of reform by a Standing Order, designed to cut out the &quot;backwoodsmen&quot; by providing that no peer shall be entitled to vote unless he has attended so many times in the Session.   There are obvious attractions about any scheme whichwould enable the House to reform itself.   Unfortunately, however, there arestrong constitutional difficulties about any solution on Lord Exeter&apos;s lines,and, as at present advised, we are very doubtful whether it could be adopted.   but some combination of the Simon proposal for Life Peers and the Exeter proposalfor limiting the right to vote might provide a possible solution.10. The Committee will pursue its researches now that parliament has reassembled.S.Office of the Lord President of the Council, S.W.1.17th October, 1953. -2-
