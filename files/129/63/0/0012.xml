Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1953C. (53) 2621st October, 1953SECRETCopy No.61CABINETRESTORATION OF PRIVATE TRADING IN MAGNESIUMMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and minister of MaterialsMy colleagues may be interested to know that after consultation with theindustry I have decided to restore private trading in magnesium. The Ministry ofMaterials will cease to trade in magnesium and private importation will be per-mitted from 1st January, 1954. I shall be announcing the decision early in October.2. Public trading in magnesium was re-introduced in 1951 because of theserious shortage which had developed as a result of rearmament and Americanstockpiling, and the Government-owned magnesium plant at Clifton Junction,Manchester, was reopened. The supply position (including our stocks) is now such that the needs of the United Kingdom, including requirements for the strategic reserve, can be met through normal trade channels. It will be possible to ceaseproduction on Government account in this country, and notice is being given of thetermination of the existing arrangements at Clifton Junction. Magnesium Elektron,Limited, the Ministry&apos;s agents, are, however, considering whether to continue pro-duction on a commercial basis with a more economic process. We shall give them what help we can short of direct or indirect financial assistance.3. In calculating its selling price the Ministry of Materials has been obligedto average the cost of the more expensive home-produced magnesium and the cheaper imported metal. One advantage of restoring private trading should, there-fore, be that United Kingdom consumers will be able to buy their magnesium more cheaply.4. The arrangements for restoring private trading in magnesium have been worked out in consultation with the Treasury, the Ministry of Defence, the Board ofTrade, and the Ministry of Supply.W.Ministry of Materials, SWA,29th September, 1953.44936
