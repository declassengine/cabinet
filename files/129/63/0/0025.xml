Ministers have agreed to the meeting.   The principles, whichare based on previous statements of Government policy, have been discussed by the Food and   Agriculture Committee and at the request of the Committee Ihave prepared the attached draft Ministerial statement for discussion with theNational Farmers&apos; Unions.   The Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister ofFood and the Financial Secretary, Treasury have been consulted but it has notbeen possible in the time to provide for their comments.   The passages not yetagreed are shown with alternatives or in square brackets.T.L.D.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, S.V7.1.5th October, 1953.DRAFT statement the leaders of the National Farmers&apos; Unions have discussed policyin relation to price and market guarantees with Ministers.   The general principlesof Government policy as set out below were confirmed and the National Farmers&apos;Unions were assured that the Government will continue to be guided by these principles in making arrangements for implementation of Part I of the agriculture act, 1947.2. The following statement sets out the general background to theGovernment&apos;s policy and the principles that guide it, together with theGovernments interpretation of these principles, which is given in the hope that itwill avoid misapprehensions for the future.General Background Statement3. During the war we had a siege economy.   Our home agriculture hadto play its part by producing more of the bulkier foods and feedingstuffs.   So far ahead as can be foreseen we must go on producing in this country a large partof our food.   But we have moved away from a siege economy.   Pood is more plentiful
and the choice wider.   Consumers must be able to exercise their ownpreferences.   Producers too must be freed from controls wherever possible sothat their own enterprise and efficiency may have full scope.4. The methods to be used for providing guaranteed prices and assuredmarkets must be adapted to present-day conditions.   This was foreseen whenthe Agriculture Act was discussed in Parliament in 1947.   It was clearly stated by the Government of the day that the price and market guarantees forthe main agricultural products might be provided by a variety of differentarrangements;  and that these included deficiency payments, support prices,subsidies and acreage payments, according to the nature of the commodity.   Inthe event, State trading continued for several years to play a predominant partin carrying out the guarantees.   But, while effective guarantees will becontinued, central purchase and fixed prices cannot always be maintained aswe move into greater freedom;  nor should it be expected that guarantees mustbe provided for producers individually;  the obligations under the Act can be discharged by guarantees to the industry as a whole and by any of the various methods just mentioned.5. The seven principles set out below, and the Governmentsinterpretation of them, show the lines of policy that are to be pursued.The Seven PrinciplesI &quot;To maintain the stability of the industry in a freer economy. &quot;6. Stability does not mean that there should be no changes.   Consumerrationing and the controls associated with it are becoming unnecessary.   Thisfreedom to buy what and where the consumer chooses has to be combined withstability for the producer.   We cannot do that by going on indefinitely withState trading;  we want to get rid of all unnecessary interference with private trade.   Producers cannot be wholly isolated from market influences.   But ourprice and market guarantees will shield producers from the full effect ofsudden and serious changes in market prices.   This will be the guiding principle;the precise arrangements will vary from one commodity to another.II &quot;To achieve this by a continuation of Price Reviews in accord with the principles contained in the Agriculture Act. &quot;or&quot;To continue to hold Annual and Special Reviews in accordancewith Part I, Section 2, of the Agriculture Act, 1947. &quot;7. The reviews provided for by the Agriculture Act will continueto be held annually and special reviews will be held When circumstances justifythem.   The objective will continue to be to provide for proper guarantees of price and market.   But procedure at the reviews will need to be adapted to theconditions of an increasingly free economy.   3?or instance, the forecast ofaggregate net income of the industry will be subject   to a greater margin of errorthan in the past.   But it will continue to serve as a valuable indication of the trend and level of net income.   This will still be one of the main factors whichthe Government will take into account /in relation to national economic conditionsgenerally/when reaching decisions.III &quot;To ensure a level of guarantee of price, which would encourageand maintain the production required having regard to all the relevant factors (including trends in market prices). &quot;
IV &quot;To devise varying methods of implementing guarantees for different commodities in consultation with the Unions withthe aim of reaching agreement. &quot;8. It is for the Government under the Agriculture Act to decide, ingeneral terms, the agricultural production which is desirable in the national interest.   In the past, governments have had. to rely mainly upon estimates ofnational requirements.   In future the Government will be able to have moreregard to consumer choice.   This will to a large extent be reflected in levels andtrends of market prices.   Precise targets will not necessarily be set for particular commodities.9, The level of price guarantee needed to encourage the desirablelevel of production must also be decided by the Government, but will vary according to the type of guarantee^   /No one method of providing for this is,in principle, better than another^/  For each commodity, the general objectivewill be to ensure a fair return to producers as a whole.   But in working outthe details the special problems of that commodity will be taken into account.The Government will take full advantage of the advice of the representatives ofagricultural producers and of other bodies whose views must be considered,V &quot;In suitable cases, where a marketing board exists or is set up under the Agricultural Marketing Acts, 1931 to 1949, to make as full use as possible of it ^or - as full use of it as may be appropriate/ in connection with arrangements for carrying outthe guarantees of price and market. &quot;VI  &quot;To encourage producers to make a practical contribution to the stability of their own industry with appropriate safeguards forthe interests of consumers. &quot;10. The Government reaffirm that they are prepared to consider sympathetically proposals for marketing schemes under the agricultural marketing Acts,   They welcome the initiative of producers in increasing theefficiency of their production and marketing arrangements* whether by meansof schemes under the Agricultural Marketing Acts or by other meanSj/provided they are consistent with the national interest/,11, Where a marketing scheme exists, or is put forward by producersfor the purposes of efficient marketing, the Government are prepared, toconsider arrangements by which the marketing board would piay an appropriatepart in implementing the guarantees of price and market.   Such a board is notnecessarily the only means of providing these guarantees, and the part which itcan play will depend on several things.   The most important are the nature of themarket in question, the precise arrangements for the guarantees in the particularcasey and the safeguards required when substantial Exchequer moneys are beingdisbursed.12. Where a marketing board buys and sells either the whole or partof the output of a commodity, the efficiency with Which it does its marketing may affect not only producers but also the amount of the Exchequer liability.   Producersthrough the board, can make a contribution to stability by building up reserves in good years.   But it will also be necessary to ensure that there is an incentive for a board to avoid or minimise losses^in less good times.   Thismeans that producers should bear a /an effective/ share of the risks with the
Exchequer  ,Jo\xt without detracting seriously from the value of the guaranteesgiven to them/.13. Safeguards for consumers and other interests are required hy theAgricultural Marketing Acts.   But some changes in existing administrative arrangements maybe necessary to make the safeguards fully effective in modern conditions.VII &quot;To aim to secure sufficient time for full and carefulconsideration of the intricate financial and marketingproblems involved in any long-term arrangements, &quot;14. To provide for the continuation of guaranteed prices and assuredmarkets for agricultural producers with freedom of consumer choice is anexceedingly complex problem.   It requires full and careful consideration withall the interests concerned.   On the other hand the Government are under an obligation to release the consumer and the producer from unnecessaryrestrictions at the earliest practicable moment.   They cannot therefore regard themselves as obliged to continue full control of a commodity for an interim period while new marketing arrangements are being promoted.   At the sametime the Government are determined, not least in the interests of producers,that whatever permanent arrangements are made for the implementation of the1947 Act shall be administratively sound, ensure that proper economy is exercised, and stand the test of time.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries,3, Whitehall Place, S.W.1.
