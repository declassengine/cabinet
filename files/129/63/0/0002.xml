Printed for the Cabinet. September 1953SECRET o-n^Ln&apos; ona^ Copy No&apos; 6- R E C O R D C O P VC. (53) 252September, 1953CABINETWHITE PAPER ON COMPETITIVE TELEVISIONMemorandum by the Postmaster-general as requested by the Cabinet (C.C. (53) 45th Conclusions, Minute 8) I circulate the attached draft White Paper on Television Policy.Timetable2. The Government statements in Parliament on television (2nd July)promised a White Paper &quot; in the autumn,&quot; and Parliament will no doubt expectit to be issued about the end of October, and to be debated before Christmas.Basis of Proposals3. I have tried to take account of three opposing points of view, all strongly held. First, the Official Opposition; they may be expected to oppose the proposals as a matter of course, but they can hardly object basically to a Public Corporation,and may, moreover, be a little daunted by the speeches at the Trades UnionCongress in favour of competition. Second, an influential body of opinion(including many of our own Party) much of which approves of competition inprinciple but is afraid of entrusting this great force to advertisers; the proposals should satisfy all but a small minority of these, partly because of the competitionbeing provided by a Public Corporation, but also because of our undertaking thatprogrammes shall not be &quot; sponsored,&quot; that is that they should be controlled bythe owner of the station and not by advertisers. Third, an important section ofour Party who favour full-blooded private enterprise competition; the majority ofthese will, I hope, acquiese in the proposals in view of the present shortage ofusable frequencies and the possibility of introducing further competition in thefuture. So far as the Press is concerned, reaction to the proposals may well belukewarm since the Press will still fear the possible loss of a proportion of theirown advertising revenue (although this has not happened in the United States).finance. It is difficult to give a firm estimate of cost at this stage. Until the Cor-poration is established there is no means of knowing to what extent they will buyor rent programmes from outside sources and thus save studio space; or, in thecase of programmes produced by themselves, rent studio space rather than buy orbuild it.5. In so far as I have been able to consult outside opinion on this matter, there seems to be almost universal agreement that the Corporation, if well run, shouldquickly establish itself and make money. If that is correct, then whatever money is advanced by the Government should not be for a very long duration. The initialcapital for transmitting stations, studios, offices and working expenses could either be raised in the City by Government guaranteed stock or provided by an Exchequerloan.
6. The Corporation will probably need at least  1 - million for stations andequipment (assuming that initially they will lease rather than build studios and offices) and running expenses would probably be some  3^ millions a year or more(some  2\, millions on the programmes themselves--as compared with the british broadcasting Corporation^  li millions--and the rest for engineering, accommoda-tion, publicity and depreciation). The rate at which revenue comes in will dependon the quality, of programmes and the rate at which existing sets are adapted toreceive the new programme; but it wovild seem reasonable to expect at least  1^millions revenue in the first year and  2 millions in the second. Thus theCorporation would need:    Million1953-55   .........      ... 1      (stations and equipment)1955-56   ............ 2      (3i less 1  revenue)1956-57   ............ li    (3i less 2 revenue)Total ...      ... . . ... 4!A loan of  4-5 millions, spread over a period of three years, would thus be needed. It would be reasonable to provide for repayment to be spread over thefourth and subsequent years of operation.Constitution of Corporation7. There is much to be said for setting up the new Corporation under RoyalCharter rather than by Statute, both to give it a status comparable with that ofthe British Broadcasting Corporation and to economise in Parliamentary time.In view, however, of the controversy that has surrounded this question it maywell be that this is not considered desirable. In any case, we should have to take action during the 1953-54 Session if the new Corporation is to start operatingeven in 1955.8. I put this White Paper before my colleagues in the hope that it may beconsidered to offer a practical solution to what has proved to be a most intractableproblem. I trust that we may now come to a decision as further delay will tendto increase rather than diminish the difficulties and controversy that it has alreadyaroused.D.Post Office Headquarters,9th September, 1953.
DRAFT WHITE paper i. The General problem in the previous White Paper on Broadcasting (Cmd. 8550 of .1952) theGovernment stated that &quot; in the expanding field of television provision should bemade to permit some element of competition when the calls on capital resources atpresent needed for purposes of greater national importance made this feasible.&quot;The Government also promised that &quot;Parliament should have an opportunity of considering, before the licensing of the first station, the terms and conditions underwhich competitive television would operate.&quot; Many of the fears lately expressed as to the Governments policy arise from a misconception of the form competitivebroadcasting might take in this country; and it is in order to inform Parliamentof the Governments views in greater detail that this further White Paper is being issued.Position of the British Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.)2. The proposal that there should be competition with the B.B.C. is in no way a criticism of that body, of whose achievements the whole country is justlyproud. Indeed, the Governments proposals leave the B.B.C. as the main instru-ment for broadcasting in Great Britain and (as stated in the previous White Paper)&quot; the only broadcasting organisation having any claim on the revenue frombroadcasting receiving licences.&quot; Not only is this so, but the Government hasrecently authorised a very considerable extension of the B.B.C.&apos;s activities whichwill bring more than 90 per cent, of the population of Great Britain within range of its television programmes much the highest density of coverage of any countryin the world.Question of Monopoly3. As television has great and increasing power in influencing men&apos;s minds,the Government believes that its control should not remain in the hands of a singleauthority, however excellent it may be, and that a monopoly of television can no more be justified than a monopoly of the Press or any other source of information or entertainment. Moreover, competition would be in the best interests of viewers,writers, artistes and technicians. There will also be an increasing and urgentdemand for filmed television programmes throughout the world, and competitionat home will induce vitality and help Britain to produce programmes for overseas markets. -II. Examination of ProblemPractical Aspects of Competitive Organisation4. The question then arises as to the best way of introducing an element of competition with the B.B.C. Another corporation similar to the B.B.C. could beset up and financed in the same way from licence revenue. This possibility hasbeen rejected. It would involve raising the licence fee to double or treble thepresent amount and the difficulty of collecting this revenue might well prejudice the whole licensing system; there would also be the problem of apportioning thelicence revenue fairly between two corporations.5. So far as the Government can see, the most practical means of financinga competitive organisation is through advertisements. This has already beenadopted in the British Commonwealth and elsewhere. There are, however, two important factors which must be taken into account; one is the shortage offrequencies usable at the present time, and the second is the misgiving which hasbeen expressed in certain quarters regarding a system of television which is financedin this particular way.Technical Considerations6. To take first the technical difficulty, the Report of the Television AdvisoryCommittee published in July last made it clear that any new television develop-ment can only take place in three separate ranges or bands of frequencies apartfrom the band now being used by the B.B.C, (which is just big enough to accommo-date the stations needed to give the present television programme full nationalcoverage). These three bands are known as Bands III, IV and V. Within a fewyears, when the technical difficulties of Bands IV and V have been overcome, many
more channels will be available. But at the present time, as the Televison AdvisoryCommittee Report points out, Band III is the only one for which transmitting and receiving equipment can be produced quickly, and within Band III only two channelsare readily available. This does not mean that only two transmitting stations canbe set up; the number of stations on each channel depends on the power and range of the stations and their distance apart and many different combinations of power and distance are possible. Provided they are sufficiently low-powered soas not to interfere with one another, there could be quite a number of local stations;but it will for some years be impossible to secure anything approaching nationalcoverage for more than one alternative programme.Programme Standards7. Most of the misgivings which have been expressed regarding a system oftelevison financed by advertisement arise from a fear that the standard of the programmes would be debased in order to attract a maximum audience for theadvertisements. This view is based upon assumptions which the government cannot accept. The first is that the British people, with their unfettered freedomof the press, the stage, the cinema and the ballot box, must not be allowed to look at televison programmes other than those provided from one source. The second is that the type of programme and the percentage of advertising material which are acceptable in other countries would necessarily be adopted here. This is equallyillogical; the British people have their own way of doing things. Nor is it truethat the programmes would be sponsored in the sense in which that term is oftenunderstood. The responsibility for the programme would rest not upon theadvertiser but upon the owner and operator of the station. Thus there is a vastdifference between accepting advertisements and sponsoring. The Press acceptadvertisements but they remain responsible for their own news and editorialcolumns.Possible Forms of Competition8. If the only considerations were the technical limitations imposed by the availability of channels at the present time, then three types of service would bepossible:  (1) A number of independent stations, each broadcasting its own television programme locally.(2) A variant of (.1) involving &quot; network operation &quot; as practised in the UnitedStates and elsewhere. This system enables independent stations tolink up and broadcast the same programme for an agreed propprtionof their total broadcasting time. As already explained, present technicallimitations would permit only one such network.(3) A single commercial television authority broadcasting on virtually anational scale.9. (1) and (2) theoretically have the advantage of securing diversity of owner-ship and control. In both cases however there would be the difficulty of choosingfrom amongst the numerous applicants for licences the few to whom licences couldactually be granted at the present time, taking into account the applicants&apos; ability to provide a regular service and, in particular, their technical competence andfinancial resources. Many of the applicants would no doubt be able to satisfythese criteria and the final selection, so long as the number of licences had to belimited, would have to be quite arbitrary. On the other hand a single nationalnetwork or a single commercial television authority would have a completemonopoly of television advertising for several years at least.III. Government ProposalsPublic Corporation10. In order to meet these difficulties and also to satisfy those who, whilstagreeing with competition in principle, feel that an advance should be made withcaution, the Government considers that the best way of proceeding would be toset up a Public Corporation, dependent on advertisement revenue, to providecompetitive programmes. Such a corporation would not in any way prejudicefuture decisions on broadcasting policy when the large number of frequencychannels in Bands IV and V become available and greater experience has been gained.
Method of Operation11. The new corporation would provide practical experience of the effect of advertising on television broadcasting, from the standpoint of both the operatorand the viewer. It would have the advantage, like the B.B.C., of combiningdirection and control in one body. It would not therefore have to be subject to restrictions and limitations imposed by an outside controlling body which, to be effective, would have to be given powers which might well stultify the success of aprivate commercial organisation; nor would the ban on politics and religionmentioned in the Governments previous White Paper any longer be necessary.No advertisements would however be associated with news commentaries or political and religious broadcasts. The corporation would be free to produce itsown programmes, to buy or contract for programmes prepared by outside bodiesspecialising in this type of work, to put on documentary films or &quot; shoppers&apos; guides &quot;prepared by advertisers, or to transmit other programmes, e.g., from theatres, sportsevents, public spectacles, &amp;c. At some periods, where appropriate, broadcasts couldbe on a regional basis. The corporation would, however, like the B.B.C., be com-pletely responsible at all times, for the programmes put out from its stations no matter from what source they came. As regards advertisements, the corporation would be required to agree with the Postmaster-General its general arrangements,including the proportion of broadcasting time to be allotted to advertising, the types of advertising and classes of advertisement to be excluded, and the frequencyand duration of the intervals during which advertising would normally be allowed.No advertisements, either direct or indirect, would be allowed during the course ofwhat is presented as a normal programme. The corporation would also be expectedto agree with the Postmaster-General to what extent Advisory Committees wouldbe necessary or desirable.Constitution^,               .          , , ,              under Royal Charter  , . . . .12.   The corporation would be set up ^v gtatute-  fQr a*i initial period of, say, ten years; but if it is to be a genuine experiment, its methods ofworking, of preparing programmes, and of presenting advertisements would need to be open to revision at any time and certainly to review before 1962 when theB.B.C.&apos;s present Charter expires. Like the B.B.C. the new Corporation would operate under a licence issued by the Postmaster-General, as required by the wireless Telegraphy Acts. It would be governed by a Board of Directors appointedby the Government. It would submit an Annual Report and Statement of accounts to the Postmaster-General, who would present them to Parliament.Parliament would be given facilities for discussing the corporation^ affairs, but,like other public bodies, the corporation would be given independence in the handling of day-to-day matters, including individual programmes.Initial Scope13. The corporation would be given the use of the two available channels inBand III and, in conformity with the Government^ experimental approach to thequestion, would begin with stations in London, and possibly two other large centres of population. Further development would be subject to the normal Governmentinvestment control.Finance14. The corporation would require adequate finance in the early stages before it became self-supporting. The initial capital, including working capital, would beprovided in the form of a Government loan, the rate of advance, the rate of interestand the terms of repayment of which would have to be agreed by the corporation,the Treasury and the Postmaster-General.IV. Conclusion15. In submitting these proposals for the consideration of Parliament, theGovernment is deeply conscious of the importance television broadcasting is likelyto have in the coming years. Experience has already shown how much it can, ifproperly used, enrich our lives, and this is but a beginning. Yet like most importantadvances, television brings many problems in its train, including, in the Govern-menfs view, the need to ensure that the new medium remains open for the free expression of ideas, with programmes prepared from a number of independent
sources. It would, however, be rash to proceed precipitately, even if technical consideration allowed, and the Government hopes that its proposal for a secondtelevision broadcasting corporation on the lines proposed above will commend itself to Parliament and the public.V. Summary(1) The Government confirms its view that some element of competitionshould be permitted in television (paragraph 1).(2) The B.B.C. remains as the main instrument of broadcasting in GreatBritain and its activities are indeed being extended (paragraph 2).(3) The Government considers that in present circumstances the best coursewould be to set up a public corporation, dependent on advertisementrevenue, to provide competitive television programmes (paragraph 10).(4) Such a corporation would be responsible for all programmes.   It would agree its arrangements for advertisements with the Postmaster-General(paragraph 11).tr. m . ,, , under Royal Charter r(5) The corporation would be set up by Statute-      &apos; say&apos; tenyears initially and would be governed by a Board of Directors appointedby the Government (paragraph 12).(6) The Corporation would be given the use of the two available channelsin Band III (paragraph 13).(7) Initial capital, including working capital, would be provided in the formof a Government loan (paragraph 14).(8) The Governments present proposals would not in any way prejudicefuture decisions on television broadcasting policy (paragraph 10).
