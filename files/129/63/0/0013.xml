secret. (53) 26330th SEPTEMBER, 1953.CABINET OFFICiRECORD COPY&apos;COPY NO. 73CABINETSCMAEILAND PROTECTORATE:EXCHANGE OF TERRITORY WITH ETHIOPIAMemorandum by the lord President of the Counciland the Secretary of Stats for the Colonies.We wish to consult our colleagues about proposed negotiationswith the Ethiopian Government designed to secure for certain British Protectedtribes in the Somaliland Protectorate their traditional grazing lands in the regionknown as the Haud, which at present lie in Ethiopian territory.2. The proposals would rectify the position created by the Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1897 which established a frontier line bisecting the traditionalgrazing areas of British Somali tribes.   The result was that over half the tribesof the Protectorate spent six months of every year in Ethiopian territory in search of grazing and water.3. At present the greater part of these grazing lands in Ethiopianterritory is under British administration under the terms of the TemporaryAnglo - Ethiopian Agreement of 1944.   This is a wartime Agreement which isunsuitable for renewal in peacetime and may be terminated by either side at three months&apos; notice.   Some more permanent and secure arrangement for our occupation of the grazing areas is desirable.4. If these grazing lands cannot be secured on lease for monetarypayment it is proposed to hand over to the Ethiopians in exchange for them the protectorate port of Zeila together with a Corridor leading to it from Ethiopia.A map illustrating the proposals is attached (Annex II).5. The proposal to exchange the Haud grazing areas for the CeilaCorridor was first put forward in 1933, was revived after the war and has beenthe subject of discussion and negotiation with the Ethiopians since 1946.   for various reasons, however, little progress has been made.6. The Ethiopians have again signified their readiness to re-open negotiations on the basis of an exchange of territory and it is proposed that anattempt be made to reach agreement in November as part of the generalnegotiation of an Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty of Friendship to replace the TemporaryA.greement of 1944.7. A note explaining in detail the previous course of negotiations andthe present proposals is attached (Annex I).  Authority is now sought to proceedalong the lines of the recommendations in paragraph 19 of the note.S.30th September, 1953. O.E.-1-
so the frontier line between British Somaliland  and Ethiopia, as defined in the Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1897, had the unsatisfactory effect ofbisecting the traditional grazing areas of British Somaliland tribes.   The Treatyprovided, however, that tribes on either side of the frontier were free to make use of their traditional grazing areas on the other side.   Under this provisionover half of the total population of British Sornaliland crossed the frontierevery year into Ethiopia in search of grazing and water.   For many years it waspossible for British Officers to follow and administer the tribes while they werein Ethiopian territory, but this facility came to an end with the demarcation of thefrontier in 1933/34.   As a result over half the tribes of British Somaliland passedout of British jurisdiction for six months of every year and were dependent fortheir subsistence on grazing lands in territory beyond British protection and administration.2. Negotiations were about to begin with Ethiopia to enable her majesty&apos;s Government to acquire that part of the grazing areas in Ethiopianterritory known as the Haud, in exchange for the British Somaliland port of Zeilaand a corridor leading to it from Ethiopia, when the Italo-Ethiopian war intervened. &apos;During the Italian occupation of Ethiopia an agreement was made with the Italiansfor the use of the grazing areas by British protected tribes in return for certainfacilities accorded to the Italians in Berbera.    Since the liberation of Ethiopia in1942, the Haud and an adjacent area known as the Reserved Area have remainedunder British administration.    Our present rights of administration there are accorded by the temporary Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement of 1944.     This Agreementmay, however, be terminated by either side at three months&apos; notice.3. In 1946 negotiations opened between Her Majesty&apos;s Government andthe Government of Ethiopia for the proposed Zeila/l-Iaud exchange but little progress was made.    At one stage the Ethiopians asked for a wider corridor than we wereprepared to concede and at the same time offered us a greater area of land in ethiopia than we required.    &quot;When Her Majesty&apos;s Government replied with an offer of a narrower corridor to Zeila the Ethiopian Government reduced their offer of territory to an area considerably smaller than our minimum requirements.4. Apart from the difficulty of agreeing on the exact extent of land tobe exchanged, the proposed exchange has foundered on two obstacles - HerIvlajesty&apos;s Government&apos;s concern over the withdrawal of British protection from the tribes in the Zeila corridor, and the &quot;Railway Servitude&quot; created by Article 9 ofthe Italo-Franco-British Treaty of 1906, under which the contracting GovernmentsGovernments undertook not to construct without previous agreement any railway lineentering Ethiopian territory which would compete with those already established.This, in fact, meant the French Addis Ababa - Jibuti railway.    As a result of consultations with the French Government in 1949 it was agreed in an Anglo-Frenchexchange of notes (Command 7758) that any treaty providing for an exchange of territory with the Ethiopians should include a provision that the territory cededwould be subject to all international rights and obligations attaching to the territory and that the United Kingdom should make it clear in a communication to the ethiopian Government that one of the obligations concerned was the Servitudecreated by Article 9 of the Treaty of 1906.    The Ethiopians bitterly resent boththe 1906 Treaty and the Anglo-French notes, which they consider an infringement oftheir sovereignty and therefore cannot recognise.    Because of this they have soProposal for an Exchange of Territory betweenthe Sornaliland Protectorate and Ethiopia,
far refused to give the necessary guarantees.    Although present indications are thatthe Ethiopian Government would not, in fact, wish to build a railway in the corridor,the difficulty remains of composing Ethiopian susceptibilities without prejudice toour obligations to the French Government.5. In 1950 H. M. Ambassador at Addis Ababa was instructed tonegotiate an exchange of territory whereby, in exchange for the grazing areas, weshould hand over a narrow corridor leading to Zeila, approximately 25 miles widealong the coast, and in addition offer a monetary payment of up to  500,000.6. Eater, however, in view of the difficulties mentioned in paragraph 4and because it was thought that the Ethiopians, having acquired other access to thesea through Eritrean ports, would be less interested in the port of Zeila, it wasdecided instead to try to negotiate a lease of the grazing areas for a sum of up to 500,000.    This proposal did not entail any surrender of territory on our side.7. H. Ivl. Ambassador at Addis Ababa has now reported that the ethiopians nevertheless wish to negotiate on the basis of exchange of territory, andthat they are unlikely, for political reasons, to agree to any surrender of Ethiopianterritory without a corresponding territorial gain.8. Negotiations are planned to begin in November as part of thegeneral negotiation of an Anglo^Ethiopian Treaty of Friendship to replace the 1944Agreement.    It is proposed that we should begin by asking for a lease of 30 years or, failing that, of 15 years, of the Baud grazing areas for a sum of up to  500,000.If, as seems likely, this is rejected, it is proposed to negotiate an exchange of territory, a corridor leading to Zeila in exchange for the grazing areas, by cessionor lease with or without additional payment to the Ethiopians of up to  500,000.Details will be worked out by the Foreign Office, Colonial Office and the treasury in consultation.    The map at Annex II illustrates these proposals.9. It should be noted that although these proposals are expressed interms of exchange of territory there would legally be no transfer of part of her majesty!s dominions.    The Somaliland Protectorate is not a British possession buta Protectorate and any transfer of territory to Ethiopia will, in effect, be by the surrender by Her Majesty&apos;s Government of their right of protection of, and jurisdiction over, the inhabitants of the land handed over.    We are advised thatthe transfer or surrender of the whole or part of a Protectorate is a matter of theRoyal Prerogative not involving an Act of Parliament.    As regards the areasobtained from Ethiopia, Ethiopia would surrender sovereignty over that territory and Her Majesty&apos;s Government would correspondingly extend her jurisdiction and protection.10. The transfer in perpetuity of the Zeila Corridor to Ethiopia would,for reasons explained, only be possible if the Ethiopian Government publicly under-took to recognize the obligation not to build a railway in the corridor which wouldcompete with the French railway to Jibuti, and, unless they modify their previousinflexible attitude, they are unlikely to agree to give such an undertaking.    It may,however, be possible to overcome the difficulty by negotiating an exchange of territory for a limited period only and including in the agreement a clause providing that neither party would have the right to construct railways on the territorieshanded over without the consent of the other.    We are advised that the insertion ofsuch a clause in an agreement handing over rights in the territories concerned for a limited period of years would mean in effect that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould have ensured that the obligation created by the 1906 Anglo-French agreement would be respected, and that such a provision would be consistent with the intentionof the Anglo-French Agreement of 1949.    This procedure would enable direct
reference to the &quot;Railway Servitude&quot; of 1906 to be avoided in the published agree-ment and Ethiopian susceptibilities might be satisfied.11. The Secretary of State for the Colonies has consulted the governor of the Somaliland Protectorate about the position of the British protected tribesin the area of the Zeila Corridor proposed for transfer to Ethiopia.    the approximate areas occupied by the tribes concerned, which are for the most partnomadic, are shown in the map at Annex II.    The Pssa tribe are estimated tonumber about 30,000, of whom about 12,000 live in or use territory in the protectorate and about 3,000 live in the Reserved Area.    They are predominantlyan Ethiopian tribe and their Sultan is an Ethiopian subject paid by the ethiopian government.    They are well armed and independent by nature.    Little control is exercised over them either by the Ethiopians or ourselves.    The Gadabursi tribenumber about 45,000, of whom some 30,000 use Protectorate land, the remainderresiding in the Reserved Area.    The Gadabur si are hostile to the Ethiopian tribesand appear anxious to remain under British   protection.    The Governor considersthat if some of their grazing lands in the Protectorate were handed over to Ethiopiait would be possible for the Gadabursi to find other land in the Protectorate furthereast.    The Gadabursi are likely, however, to be more concerned about the future administration of their agricultural land which lies in the Reserved Area (see para-graph 17 below).12. The Governor considers that the tribes in the ZeilaCorridor wouldcertainly protest against transfer to Ethiopia and that Somali nationalist societieswould also protest strongly against the placing of Somalis under a foreign power.The Somali societies would, however, probably welcome the incorporation of the grazing areas into the Protectorate.    The possibility of public and parliamentary criticism in this country if the corridor tribes are placed under Ethiopianjurisdiction against their wishes has also to be considered.13. Our view is that, while we would not welcome the transfer of the tribes in the Seila Corridor to Ethiopia, there is no alternative if we are to securethe Kaud grazing areas and if the Ethiopian Government will negotiate only on thebasis of an exchange of territory.    The public defence of the exchange of territory would be on grounds of balance of advantage to the great majority of tribesmen whorely on the Haud grazing areas for their subsistence.    The alternative to theconclusion of successful negotiations with the Ethiopian Government would be toabandon our administration in the Haud and to rely on the open frontier provision in the Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1897.    This arrangement, whereby the Governmentof the Protectorate would lose administrative control of half of the inhabitants ofthe Protectorate for six months of the year, would be most unsatisfactory.    Itwould greatly hamper the continuity and efficiency of administration and prejudicemany of the progressive measures now in hand for the economic and social develop-ment of the Protectorate.    Moreover, the Ethiopian Government might raise doubts about the continued validity of the 1897 Treaty.     While, therefore, it might bepossible to retain some form of open frontier, the position would be very insecure.If the Ethiopians ever decided to expel British tribesmen from the Haud or hindertheir freedom of movement there would be small means of redress,14. An important point for consideration is whether the tribes in theZeila Corridor which will be affected by the transfer should be consulted beforethe transfer takes place.15. There is, of course, a strong international and domestic opinionthat territories ought not to be transferred from one jurisdiction to another withoutthe consent of, or at any rate consultation with, the inhabitants, and this has been reflected in many statements of policy by United Kingdom Ministers in the past.
-S3Further, in reply to a Question in Parliament on 8th. July, 1935, with regard totentative proposals which had been under consideration for the transfer to Ethiopiaof a corridor leading to Zeila, the then Colonial Secretary said that had circumstancesarisen which required further consideration to be given to these proposals consulta-tion would have taken place with the tribes affected.    Criticism is therefore likelyto arise if the Zeila corridor is transferred without consulting the tribes.l&apos;S. Nevertheless, after full consideration and consultation with theGovernor of the Protectorate, the Colonial Secretary has reached the conclusionthat the tribes should not be consulted.    It can be assumed that the tribes in the corridor would, if consulted, be opposed to transfer.     Once, therefore, it has beendecided that the exchange of territories should take place in the interests of thegreat majority of the inhabitants of the Protectorate there seems little point inrisking long delays, and indeed endangering the whole success of the negotiations,by attempting to make any agreement with the Ethiopian Government subject to consultation with the tribes affected.    The outcome of consultation would almost certainly be unfavourable and the lapse of time before and during consultation would greatly increase the opposition of the tribes to transfer by giving agitators time towork amongst them,I17. The existence of the Reserved Area which, like the Haud, remainsunder British administration under the terms of the Temporary Agreement of 1944,is a complicating factor.    The Reserved Area is recognised Ethiopian territory and the Ethiopian Government is entitled to ask for its return at any time.    the reserved Area cannot with good faith be included in our minimum requirementsunder the proposed exchange as our expressed intention is to acquire only thosegrazing areas in Ethiopia which are a vital necessity for the British protectedtribes.    The Reserved Area is predominantly agricultural land.    On the otherhand, it would be highly satisfactory from the point of view of the Protectorate ifthe Reserved Area could be included in the territory obtained from Ethiopiabecause it contains the agricultural lands of the Cadabursi tribe and because theGadabursi will probably protest most strongly if the Reserved Area is returnedto Ethiopia, even though it is legally Ethiopian territory.     In the opening phase of negotiations it is therefore proposed to allow the Ethiopian Government to assume that Per iVIajesty&apos;s Government regard the area as being included in the territory which it is proposed to include in the exchange.    If pressed to state our intentionswith regard to the Reserved Area we should, in good faith, have to say that weshould not want our administration to continue there longer than the ethiopian government would wish.    If strongly pressed to exclude the area from theterritory which we wish to acquire we should probably have to agree to withdrawwithin a reasonable period.18. The Vice-Chiefs of Staff have concurred in these proposals on theunderstanding that rights for United Kingdom aircraft of all types to fly over theZeila Corridor are secured.    This should be easy to arrange.    They also considerit of great importance to obtain some statement of Ethiopian intentions not to allow the use of the corridor, and particularly the port of Zeila, for military purposesagainst British interests.    The Lord President considers this risk very small butit should be possible to reach some suitable understanding with the Ethiopians.Re c omme ndations19. We recommend that the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should be authorised to open negotiations with the Ethiopian Government for theacquisition of the grazing areas in the Haud region of Ethiopia which are used byBritish protected Somali tribes on the following basis:-
(i)    Her Iv!ajesty&apos;s Government should at first seek a leaseaffording rights of administration in the grazingareas for a period of 15 years or upwards for payment of a sum of up to  500,000, the negotiatorsbeing instructed to obtain the most advantageous terms possible within the lower limit of time andthe upper limit of money.(ii)    If the Ethiopian Government rejects this proposal, her majesty&apos;s Government should suggest an exchange,either in perpetuity or for a limited period, of the grazing areas in return for a corridor leading fromEthiopia to the port of Zeila as shown on the map at annex II, in which case -(a) No provision would be made for consulta-tion with the tribes in the Zeila Corridoraffected by the transfer to Ethiopia.(b) The negotiators should be given somelatitude to make adjustment in the ares which form the subject of the exchange inthe light of the reaction of the ethiopian government.(c) The negotiators  should, if satisfactory agreement cannot otherwise be reached on the area to be exchanged, be empoweredto offer a sum of up to  500,000 in additionto the area offered in exchange.(d) Appropriate arrangements should be madeto secure rights for United Kingdom air-craft to fly over the Zeila Corridor, andwe should seek some suitable understandingthat the Corridor will not be used formilitary purposes against our interests.
