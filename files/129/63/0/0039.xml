DRAFT WHITE PAPERBROADCASTING: MEMORANDUM ON TELEVISION policy.^-The General Problem1. In the previous White Paper on Broadcasting (Cmd. 8550) the Govern?ment stated that &quot;in the expanding field of television provision should bemade to permit some element of competition when the calls on capital resources at present needed for purposes of greater national importance make this feasible.&quot; The Government also promised that &quot; Parliament should havean opportunity of considering, before the licensing of the first station, theterms and conditions under which competitive television would operate.&quot;Many of the fears lately expressed as to the Governmenfs policy arise froma misconception of the form competitive broadcasting might take in thiscountry; and it is in order to inform Parliament of the Governments views in greater detail that this further White Paper is being issued.Position of B.B.C.2. The proposal that there should be competition with the B.B.C. is inno way a criticism of that body, of whose achievements the whole countryis justly proud. It has been made clear throughout that the B.B.C. would continue to be the main instrument for broadcasting in Great Britain. Indeed,the Government has recently authorised a very considerable extension of theB.B.C.&apos;s activities which will bring more than 90 per cent, of the populationof Great Britain within range of its television programmes much the highestdensity of coverage of any country in the world.Question of Monopoly3. As television has great and increasing power in influencing men&apos;sminds, the Government believes that its control should not remain in thehands of a single authority, however excellent it may be. Moreover, corn-petition should be in the best interests of viewers, writers, artistes andtechnicians. There will also be an increasing and urgent demand for filmedtelevision programmes throughout the world, and competition at home shouldinduce vitality and help Britain to produce programmes for overseas markets.II.-Examination of Problem4. The question of introducing competition in television has been examined by the Government against the background of two important factors; (i) the shortage of frequencies usable at the present time and (ii) themisgivings which have been expressed about the danger of lowering thestandard of programmes.Shortage of Frequencies5. To take first the technical difficulty. The Report of the TelevisionAdvisory Committee published in July last made it clear that any new tele-vision development should take place in three separate bands of frequencies,apart from the band now being used by the B.B.C. This latter band is justwide enough to accommodate the stations needed to give the present television programme full national coverage. The three additional bands are knownas Bands III, IV and V. At the present time, as the Television AdvisoryCommittee Report points out, techniques for using Bands IV and V are notyet fully developed in this country, and Band III is the only one for whichtransmitting and receiving equipment can be produced quickly; but withinBand III two (or possibly three) channels only can readily be made availablefor television. This does not mean that only two (or three) transmittingstations can be set up. The number of stations that there can be on eachchannel without causing interference with one another depends on the powerand range of the stations and their distance apart and many different combina-tions of power and distance are technically possible. A series of local inde-pendent stations, however, each providing its own programme, would be unsatisfactory because programmes of high quality are very expensive and involve the same cost whether the audience is small or large. This means theycould only be produced on an economic basis if local stations adopted &quot; net-work operation,&quot; i.e., linking up for the purpose of putting out the sameprogramme for the bulk Of the time, with&quot; something appf baching natidrialcoverage. It will be impossible for some years to set Up more than one suchnetwork.Standard of Programmes6. Most of the misgivings which have been expressed about commercialtelevision are based on the assumption that it could be provided only by what is usually described as &quot; Sponsoring,&quot; i.e., that advertisers would hire
III. Government proposals. The Government has taken these and other factors into account in considering various possibilities and deciding what proposals it should lay before Parliament. In the White Paper on Broadcasting (Cmd, 8550) theGovernment stated that &quot; It would be necessary to introduce safeguards against possible abuses, and a controlling body would be required for thispurpose, for regulating the conduct of the new stations, for exercising ageneral oversight of the programmes and for advising on appropriatematters.&quot; After further consideration of the problem, the Government hascome to the conclusion that it is desirable to strengthen the controllingpowers of such a body by making it a public corporation, which would own and operate the transmitting stations and other suitable fixed assets (rentingfrom the Post Office any necessary connecting links between stations) andwould hire its facilities to privately financed companies who would provideprogrammes and draw revenue from advertisements. Such an arrangementhas the advantage of offering adequate scope for the participation of privateenterprise and at the same time of ensuring effective control. It would notin any way prejudice future developments when further channels in Band III,or Bands IV and V become available for television.8. The corporation would be set up by Statute, for an initial period of,say, ten years and would, like the B.B.C., operate under licence from thePostmaster General. Its methods of working, contracting for programmes,and regulating advertisements would be open to revision at any time and certainly to review before 1962 when the B.B.C&apos;s present Charter expires.The corporation would be governed by a Board of Directors appointed by theGovernment and would submit an Annual Report and Statement of Accountsto the Postmaster General, who would present them to Parliament. Like theB.B.C., the corporation would be given independence in the handling of day-to-day matters, including individual programmes.Control of programmes9. The combining of the Controlling Body with the ownership of thetransmitting stations and other such fixed assets would in the opinion ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government be the best means of ensuring adequate standards of taste, whereas under any other scheme these would have to be safeguarded by a Controlling Body (separate from the operator) whose only effectiveweapon would be the ultimate sanction of withdrawing the operator&apos;s licence.The corporation proposed by the Government would have a flexible controlover the &quot; programme companies,&quot; whose contract could be the more easilymodified or terminated since they would not have invested large sums infixed assets which would be difficult to sell. The corporation would Ofcourse have to have the right (i) to call for programme schedules and scripts in advance;(ii) to require the companies to make sound and visual records of programmes for subsequent examination;(iii) to forbid the broadcasting of specified classes of matter;(iv) to regulate advertisements.These powers would normally be held in reserve and used only if there wasspecific reason, revealed by complaints, &amp;c, to bring the programmes of anyparticular company under closer scrutiny. As regards advertisements, thecorporation would be required to agree with the Postmaster General thegeneral conditions it would impose, such as the types of advertising aridclasses of advertisement to be excluded and the distinction to be made betweenWhat is presented as, advertisement and what as normal programme; Inpractice, the fewer rules and the less day-to-day, interference.the better;, theneed would be for a continuing friendly and.constructive contact between,the corporation and the companies.time on the television transmitters and provide and control their ownprogrammes. This however is not so; the Government has decided as abasic principle that there should be no &apos;.&apos; sponsoring&quot; and that theresponsibility for what goes out on the air shall rest upon the operator of thestation, and not on the advertiser. There is a vast difference betweenaccepting advertisements and sponsoring. The Press accept advertisementsbut they remain responsible for their own news and editorial columns.Cinemas show advertisements in the intervals, but their programmes are notsponsored by advertisers. It has been suggested that, unless advertisers were allowed to sponsor, i.e., to control the television programmes that went out over the air with their advertisements, television would have little attractionfor them as . an advertising medium. The Government has consultedrepresentative advertising bodies on this point and is satisfied that separation of: advertisements from the programmes would not prejudice the financialsuccess of the new television service,
10. Since broadcasting would be under the control of a public corpora-tion, the ban on politics and religion mentioned in the Governmenfs previous white Paper would no longer be necessary. Broadcasting on these topicswould be permitted as part of the programmes (but not as advertisements)under similar arrangements to those followed by the B.B.C. These arrange-ments are:  (a) for religion; a Central Religious Advisory Committee, with regional commitees;(b) for politics; an agreement (revised from time to time) between theParties and the B.B.C. on party political matters, and impartiality inthe treatment of all controversial issues;(c) the Corporation is not allowed to broadcast its own views.11. Steps would be taken to safeguard the British character of the programmes and also to prevent exclusive arrangements being made forthe televising to a restricted audience of sporting and other events of national importance. Subject to points such as these, the private companies wouldbe free to produce their own programmes, to buy or contract for programmesprepared by outside bodies specialising in this type of work, to put ondocumentary films or &quot; shoppers&apos; guides&quot; prepared by advertisers, or toprovide other programmes, e.g., from theatres, sports events, publicspectacles, &amp;c.  Broadcasts could be on a regional or network basis.12. The Postmaster General would specify maximum and minimumhours for broadcasting each day, and would thus control the amount of broadcasting, as he does with the B.B.C.Advisory Committees13. The corporation would also be expected to agree with the PostmasterGeneral to what extent Advisory Committees would be necessary or desirable.Selection of &quot; programme companies &quot;14. In selecting the programme companies and in fixing the duration oftheir contracts, the corporation would be free to give opportunities to anumber of companies. If the corporation felt obliged to terminate the contract of any company for whatever reason, it would be necessary to havea quick change-over to the succeeding contractor; otherwise the public wouldbe deprived of service.Frequency Channels15. The corporation would initially be given the use of two channels inBand III and, in conformity with the Governmenfs experimental approach to the question, would begin with stations in London, and possibly two other large centres of population.Finance16. The corporation would require adequate finance to pay for itsstations, studio equipment and running expenses. Capital would be providedby advances from the Treasury at a rate of interest and on terms of repay-ment to be settled by them in consultation with the Postmaster General.These advances would be repaid from revenue received under the contracts with the programme companies; and any surplus revenue could be emplyed to diminish the need for future borrowing.IV. Conclusion17. The policy which the Government recommends to Parliament is designed to achieve three objectives the first is to introduce an element of competition into television and enable private enterprise to play a fuller partin the development of this important and growing factor in our lives; thesecond is to reduce to a minimum the financial commitments of the State;and the third is to proceed with caution into this new field and to safeguardthis medium of information and entertainment from the risk of abuse orlowering of standards. It. is the public corporation, with Directors appointedby the Government and free from risk of outside pressure, which will bebasically responsible to the Postmaster General, and through him to Parlia-ment, for the standard of new programmes to be shown on the televisionscreens in our homes. With this important and fundamental safeguard, andwith the limitation of the corporation^ financial commitments to the provision and operation of its stations, &amp;c, private enterprise will be given ample scope,in providing the programmes, for its resources, initiative and flexibility. TheGovernment feels that this combination of effective control on the one handand greater freedom on the other is not only a typically British approach tothis new problem, but is one which will commend itself, at this, stage of television development, to the majority of the people of this country.
