This assessment, which has been agreed between officials of the Departments concerned, is attached as backgroundfor the cabinet discussion on Thursday 2 December.    The discountedfigures in Annex A will be circulated tomorrow.Signed   BURKE trend cabinet Office30 November 1971
CONCORDEReport &quot;by OfficialsIrrfc roduct i on1.     At their CP(7l) 15th Meeting, Ministers agreed that the CPRS should prepare an assessment of the Concorde project.   This report is a summary othe facts about the project, and has been agreed with the Departmentsconcerned.Economics2,     There is no economic case for proceeding with the aircraft.   TheBritish and French Governments have already spent  660 million on it, none of which is recoverable.   Our best estimate of the likely losses toHer Majesty&apos;s Government of continuing, are set out in Annex A.2 and A.3*73.     The last development estimate agreed with the French is  885 million at January 1971 prices of which  130 million remains to be spent by theUnited Kingdom.   This estimate is however currently being examined and theUnited Kingdom share could rise tOi ]cp million.   Possible productionlosses could amount to some  60 million- 70 million.   In additionBOACs profitability would be reduced by  90** 200 rnllion over tho first years of operation, for which some form of compensation would be sought.The potential liability to Her Majesty&apos;s Government, if it continues withthe project, could therefore be of the order of  340-^460 million,(undiscounted).   This would be offset to some extent by sales of spares.These figures include no costs for major stretching of the aircraft -see paragraph 13.4.     The potential liability has to be compared against cost of cancellation, redundancy and unemployment benefits and possibly damagesfrom the international court - a total bill of probably  135 million;although, if in the unlikely event the court held us liable for all pastFrench expenditure, this could rise to  365 million.^fThe costs to Her Majesty&apos;s Government are quoted throughout this paper;the cost to the United Kingdom would be slightly, but not significantly,larger, because the companies are employing some of their own resources,1
6.     If we assume that for one reason or another, the aircraft does not enter service, Her Majesty&apos;s Government*s loss builds up progressivelyfrom  35 million (undiscounted) by March 1972 to  375 million (undiscounted)by March 1975.   These figures do not include -Transfer payments Undiscounteda. cancellation payments to United  40mKingdom contractorsb. redundancy and unemployment benefits,  19.5mnet loss to the ExchequerResource Lossc. loss of resources as a result of  31munemploymentOrders7.     There is a wide range of sales forecasts.   BAG consider that even onpessimistic assumptions sales will be in excess of 200.   Cooper Brothers&quot;best guess&quot; is that, subject to price (see paragraph 9 below) 120 aircraft might be ordered up to 1979* with a further 40-50 aircraft thereafter.French officials consider that it is impossible to envisage selling lessthan 100 by I98O, difficult to envisage sales of less than 150, and thata sales target of 200 seems reasonable.   Our own view is that 50-150aircraft could be sold but that the probable range is 50-100: this assumes,as we think reasonable, that other airlines would feel bound to follow an air Prance and BOAC lead.8.     From the time that BOAC and Air France place orders, other airlineswill have from 6-10 months in which to convert their options into firmorders.   Even if BOAC and Air France order early in 1972 - and it is not clear whether they will - we will not have a reasonable picture of firmorders until well beyond the end of 1972.Selling Price9.     Meanwhile a decision on the selling price of the aircraft must betaken.   If the price is assessed with the aim of breaking even over 100aircraft (the top end of the BTHs &quot;most likely&quot; sales range) United Kingdomofficials consider it should be some   l5million*at July 1971 prices,*Conventionally, the selling price of Concorde is expressed in terms of dollars. But for present purposes the price is expressed in sterling,at an exchange rate of  1=42.4.2
including  0.83 million (5*5 Per cent) R and D levy.    At suoh a price Balesare likely to be very difficult, since the latest price level indicated toairlines was  11.9 million..   The firms have proposed an average price ofsome    14 million   for the first 150 aircraft, but in order to get salesstarted they propose to offer a price of    13 million   to BOAC, Air Franceand PanAm for their initial orders (up to 18 aircraft).   The policy of setting an initial low price was also suggested by Cooper Brothers.   If we accept this line as the French Government want to do and 100 aircraft are sold at the firms&apos; proposed prices, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would fail to recover any R and D levy and would also lose  25 million on production.If, as may well happen, it proves impossible to raise the price from the initial level of    13 million,   this loss would increase to  60 million.Detailed estimates are shown at Annex A.Other Contractual Conditions10.   The French Government want to leave the negotiation of sales contractsentirely to the firms.   We have up to now taken the line that certain keycontractual terms (delivery dates, guarantees, penalties, escalationconditions) should be approved by the 2 Governments.   If we have to give way to the French on this, further financial risks will be involved.Production Financing11.   Her Majesty1s Government will have to provide the bulk of the money required to finance production by BAC and Rolls Royce (1971)*   This islikely to exceed the present limit of  125 million in the industrial expansion Act I968.   New legislation would be needed to extend this limitbefore the end of 1972.   Under the only financing arrangements likely tobe negotiable with the firms, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would have to bearall BACs losses, and pay them a fixed remuneration at least on the earlyaircraft.   Rolls-Royce (1971) are likely initially to have to be guaranteedagainst loss, but would be prepared to accept a share of the risk after about the 40th aircraft sale.   They would however receive no guaranteedremuneration.BOAC Operating Subsidy12.   boac&apos;s studies show that by operating 5 Concordes their operatingprofit would be adversely affected.   The eventual outturn will depend upona number of factors, but it seems that the loss of profitability mightbe between  90 million and  200 million over the first 6 years of operation.This is B0AC*s inevitably speculative estimate, but suitable arrangements will have to be agreed with BOAC before they place an order to take account of the loss of profitability involved.3
Future Versions of Concorde13.   It is customary for civil aircraft to be modified in the course oftheir service life to improve performance and/or payload (&quot;stretched&quot;).Airlines will expect Concorde similarly to be improved, and an elementhas been included in the selling price for minor improvements.   her majesty.*s Government could well, however, come under strong pressure fromthe manufacturers and the French Government to collaborate on a stretchedversion of Concorde.   President Pompidou is on record as saying that hehas great hopes that in due course a bigger and quieter Mark II wouldscoop the market.   Any significant stretched version would cost several hundred millions of pounds.   Her Majesty&apos;s Government*s commitment is,however, limited to developing and producing the present Concorde version,and any proposal for a stretched version could therefore be consideredstrictly on its merits at the time.Noise14.   The manufacturers1 aim is that Concordefs noise at entry into service should be comparable with the existing levels of Boeing 707/BC8s.   There areno international noise riles at present for supersonic transports, andunlikely to be any to which the existing types (Concorde and TU 144) couldnot readily conform.   The types may be publishing the first notice of their proposed rules applioahle to aircraft on the American register before theend of the yearB   Provided that the manufacturers can get Concorde&quot;s noisedown to that of the Boeing 707/BC8 - there are reasonable prospects of this -and demonstrate that there is a programme to reduce noise levels furtherafter entry into service, then Concorde should prove acceptable to theAmerican and other national authorities.   But there can &quot;be no certaintyabout this or about the attitude likely to be taken &quot;by individual airportauthorities who could impose their own noise regulations for supersonic &apos;  -transports.15*   BOAC and Air France will therefore have to be given an indemnity by governments, valid at least until they take delivery of the aircraft butnot necessarily after that date, against their being unable to operate theaircraft on account of its noise.16.   Other airlines may well press for corresponding provisions in their contracts.   The worst conceivable case would arise if the manufacturerswere forced to accept a commitment to take back aircraft refused entry at certain critical airports.   But, even in this extreme case, which is unlikely in practice to arise, the attitude of the airports should become clear not later than the middle of 1973 when endurance flying commences,4
Other Forms of Pollution17*   There is no evidence that Concorde*s exhaust gasses are likely to lead to any significant changes in the earth&apos;s atmosphere.   In particular,our studies of the effect on nitrogen oxides on the ozone layer indicatethat the effect of even a fleet of 500 Concordes would he well within thelimits of variations already occurring naturally, and would probably beundetectable.   Further studies of this and of the effect of otherconstituents of Concorde!s exhaust will be carried out before entry into service, but it is most unlikely that these will do other than confirm ourpresent conclusion.18.   The engines on the production Concordes will create substantially lesssmoke than existing big jets, and smoke emission at airports will notbe a problem.19.   Satisfactory arrangements have been made to ensure that there is no danger to the passengers or crew from galactic or solar radiation, andthat the ozone in the atmosphere at Concorde*s cruising height does notcontaminate the cabin.20.   With supersonic flights confined to routes over the sea or sparsely populated areas, sonic boom should not be a problem.Technical and Safety Aspects21.   Technical progress so far has been satisfactory.   There are still,however, as is normal in any development programme, a number of problemsstill outstanding, including devising a satisfactory technique to enablethe aircraft to be brought down in the sea with the best chance of survivalfor the passengers.   But it is reasonable to expect tha,t these problemswill be overcome to allow the aircraft to be granted a Certificate of airworthiness and to be acceptable to the airlines in terms of payload and range.Anglo-French Relations and the EEC22.   It is clear, not least from President Pompidou1s commitment to the project, that the French will not willingly abandon it.   We cannot therefore cancel the project without prejudicing the ratification by france of our e.c. membership, or at least creating a situation in which wemay plausibly be held to have prejudiced it.   Unilateral cancellation thus5
becomes a theoretical possibility only after the Treaty of Accession hasbeen ratified (probably towards the end of 1972) by which time a further -125 milli o n    (undiscounted) will havo been committed to the project.The consequences of unilateral cancellation after ratification would need to be examined in the light of circumstances prevailing at the time.   a major row with the French then would make it harder for us to move the enlarged Community in the directions we want, particularly towards afavourable shift in budgetary expenditure.   If the French guessed we were planning to cancel once ratification was in the bag, they would certainlytry to close this option.legal Position23.   There is no termination clause in the Concorde Treaty.   In an attemptto provide us with a basis for unilateral withdrawal, in case that was what we came to want, it was arranged that there should be a &quot;fundamentalreview&quot; of the project.   This has not yet taken place.   But the LawOfficers&apos; present advice is that, with the lapse of time which has occurred,if Britain decided to withdraw unilaterally now on the basis of the&quot;fundamental review&quot; and the French took us to the International Court, weshould be more likely to lose than to win.   As was forecast last March,the odds have turned against us.   Our liability to the French would depend on whether the French also decided to stop or whether they decidedto continue with the projectaB     If the French decided to stopIf we lost before the International Court we would be liable for french cancellation costs of  40 million and possibily a similar sum for &quot;loss of prestige&quot;.   The possibility of our being held liable inaddition for all past French expenditure of  130 million cannot be excluded, but is considered most unlikely.b0     If the French decided to continueIf we lost before the International Court we would not have to pay their cancellation charges or damages for loss of prestige, but theCourt might hold us liable to pay the French at least our share of future developmental costs, ie  190 million.6
Unemployment24.   The jobs of 26,000 workers would be lost if we cancelled the project and the French did not continue.   They are with British aircraft corporation and Rolls-Royce at Bristol (11,300), Weybridge (4,500),Bournemouth and Coventry, and with sub-contractors in other places (8,600).Some of the workers would withdraw from the labour force and some would gostraight to other jobs; but between 65 per cent and 80 per cent of them,depending on the area, would register as unemployed.   It would take up to2 years for the bulk of the effects on the unemployed registers to disappearUnemployment in Bristol would initially be more than doubled.   The resource(or output) loss as a result of the unemployment is estimated at 31 million.   The net loss to public funds (transfer payments) would be 19g- million.    (These items are different in kind and are not additional to each other.)Effect on British Industry25.   Concorde is the only civil aircraft currently being developed inthis country.   If it were -cancelled, it would be a serious blow to theaerospace industry.   The civil aircraft side of BAC would face a majorreorganisation, and would almost certainly have to close one and possibly2 of their 3 factories at Filton, Weybridge and Hurn.   It would be doubtfulwhether BAC, which has produced the more successful of our civil designs,could preserve a viable aircraft capability.   The Rolls-RoyceBritsol Engine Division would also be seriously affected, and the morale of Rolls-Royce (1971) Jjtd as a whole would be bound to suffer.26.   In terms of design capacity, the effect of cancelling Concorde on equipment firms would be limited since much of the work has been done.But some sectors might suffer from the loss of opportunity to proveequipment by flight test in all the later stages of development, and to recover on production the money they had invested in development.27.   Our credibility as a collaborative partner in the aerospace field andin advanced technology generally would be called into question.   As aresult the chances of bringing about the  closer association which isconsidered desirable between the United Kingdom and European aerospaceindustries would inevitably be weakened.7
