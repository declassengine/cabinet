DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 143 COPY NO   6329 November 1971CABINETTHE EUROPEAN SPACE RESEARCH ORGANISATIONSPROGRAMMEMemorandum by the Lord Privy seal at the Cabinet meeting on 22 November (CM(71) 57th Conclusions,Minute 2), instructions were agreed for our delegation to the Council ofthe European Space Research Organisation (ESRO).    The Council met on23-24 November without reaching agreement on the future programme ofthe organisation, and adjourned until 8-9 December.    It is now certainthat fewer than eight of the ten member countries of ESRO will agree toparticipate in the telecommunications satellite project, so that thecondition stipulated by the Cabinet for United Kingdom acceptance of the package programme will not be fulfilled.    It is therefore necessary to reconsider the instructions to our delegation before the resumed council meeting next week.2. Only France, Germany and Belgium declared their firm support for the telecommunications project.    The Netherlands, Switzerland,Denmark and Spain each declined with differing degrees of emphasis.Italy and Sweden are still undecided, but the probability is that Swedenwill follow the lead of the United Kingdom and Italy if both decide toparticipate.3. As matters stand now there are two likely eventualities on8-9 December:-a.      That Italy will declare its support of the package programme,including the telecommunications project (possibly in response toan assurance that the United Kingdom would do the same).    In this case the United Kingdom and Italy could jointly block the expensivedevelopment phase of the telecommunications satellite if, in 1975,we still deemed the system to be non-viable and unsupported byany established user requirement.    Swedish participation wouldnot materially affect the issue.1
b.      That the package will gain no further support and remainbacked by only France, Germany and Belgium.    In this case,should the United Kingdom decide to join, we would be unable to block phase II of the telecommunications project in 1975 if theother three were determined to continue with it.    On the otherhand, if in these circumstances we decided not to join, theUnited Kingdom would not be isolated from the members of theEuropean Communities since we would be in the company ofItaly and the Netherlands.4. In either case, as the result of fewer countries participating, thecost to the United Kingdom would be increased above the estimate givenin CP(71) 131.    It is impracticable to predict the increase exactly, butin case a. it might amount to about 10 to 15 per cent more than if all members of ESRO had accepted the package, with the incidence ofadditional costs possibly being greater after 1977.    In case b. the extra cost would probably lie between 25 and 30 per cent, depending on how much of the programme was supported by countries who were unwilling to take part in the telecommunications project.REC recommend TION5. I invite my colleagues to consider whether our delegation shouldbe given fresh instructions before the resumed Council meeting on8-9 December, and in particular to decide, in relation to each of thecircumstances described in paragraphs 3 a and 3 b, if they should beauthorised to commit the United Kingdom to full participation in theESRO package programme.J.Civil Service Department29 November 1971
