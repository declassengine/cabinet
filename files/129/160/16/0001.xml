confidential[HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY JS government cp(71) 151 COPY NO     6 37 December 1971CABINETPUBLICATION OF PROGRAMME ANALYSIS and review MATER.IALMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury. In CP(71) 43 I invited the Cabinet to agree that the list of programme Analysis and Review (PAR) topics for any year shouldnot be published or revealed in whole or in part to the Select Committeeon Expenditure.    Disclosure might sometimes be embarrassing or arousefalse expectations, and many reviews would not lead to the type of decision which could be announced.    The Cabinet endorsed this view (CM(7l) 19thConclusions, Minute 8).    The Prime Minister 5 in summing ups said itwould be In accordance with established practice not to disclose the methods by which the Government was reviewing any subject under study9 and itshould not be publicly indicated whether any particular topic was being reviewed as a PAR rather than by other means.    Departments have repliedaccordingly to the Select Committee on Expenditure,2. Now that the 1971 PARs are nearly complete a slightly differentquestion arises.    It has been envisaged all along that selected material from a PAR might be published in Green or White Papers.    But should itbe open to individual Ministers to reveal when announcing policy decisionsthat they have been based on a PAR, or when publishing material to saythat it originates from a PAR on a specified topic?3, If we answer:  &quot;Yes&quot;, the risk is that we should be regarded asdeparting in some degree from the line taken with the Select Committee?that the way in which policy review is undertaken Is a purely domesticmatter.    Given that we wish to retain the initiative on what we do or donot reveal about domestic policy reviews^ it is arguably easier to standon &quot;methods are domestic&quot; than on &quot;we may reveal the use of PAR0 butonly after the event and in cases we select&quot;.    But there is real advantage in not appearing more Inflexible or secretive than we mustj and, followingearlier announcements about its introduction, it will be increasingly difficult to talk publicly about the use of PARe or to give It any publiccredibility, if examples can never be quoted-    It ought in practice tobe possible to distinguish between revealing on demand what topics wereor had been under review, and by what method! and saying after the eventthat a particular decision or published material derived from a particulartype of analysis.1
4. There are indications that the Select Committee on Expendituremay make wider inquiries about PAR in the next few weeks.    I recommendthat the line to be takem in the Select Committee and elsewhere, shouldcontinue to be as in Civi(7l) 19th Conclusions, but with the gloss that itshould be open to Departments to reveal after the event that a particulardecision resulted from a PAR, or that particular published material was based on a PAR.M V treasury Chambers6 December 19712
