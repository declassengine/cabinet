THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT10 December 1971CABINETUPRATING OF NATIONAL INSURANCE benefits memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. I am not seeking in this paper to argue against the principle of annual upratings of these benefits, but I cannot accept the proposals ofthe Secretary of State for Social Services in CP(71) 153 that we shouldcommit ourselves to such upratings if it involves starting them from1972.    This paper explains why, and suggests an alternative.2. In the first place, an uprating during the financial year 1972-73will pose grave problems for taxation policy and administration.3. In order to collect tax which is due when pensions are increased,pensioners1 PAYE code numbers have to be altered, if arreas of tax areto be avoided.    The commitment of the Inland Revenue to recoding in preparation for tax unification rules out any possibility of recoding forpensioners during 1972-73.    The Annex explains this more fully.4. Therefore, a pensions uprating in 1972 would mean that I shouldhave to legislate to relieve pensioners of liability to tax on the additionalamount of their pensions, whatever their total income.    In view of thecontinual pressure for special tax treatment for pensions, this would be amost dangerous departure.,    These problems of taxation administration and policy would, on the other hand, be greatly relieved if pensionupratings in future took effect in April.5. Second, our plans for public expenditure, recently announced in cmnd 4829 and debated in Parliament only this week, explicitly provideonly for biennial upratings, in accordance with our Manifesto.    the annex to CP(71) 153 shows the additional public expenditure directly involved in every future year by annual upratings.    A further  20 million a year would, I understand, be at risk on account of public service pension upratings.    Against this background, it would become quiteobvious that a decision now to adopt annual upratings had been taken inhaste, and doubt might well be cast on our confidence in the future successof our anti-inflationary policies.
6. Such a decision, would also give rise to the question of findingroom for the additional cost, at the expense of other objectives - in theSocial Security field or elsewhere - if that proves necessary when wenext review expenditure.7. There is an alternative course, which I commend, namely to bring forward the next uprating from the autumn of 1973 to April of that year.(Subsequent upratings - whether biennial or, if we were later so to decide,annual - would similarly be in April).    This would reduce the interval between the last uprating and the next, would avoid the taxation problems,and cost less than upratings in both 1972 and 1973-    If this course were adopted the size of the uprating could be made known on the eve of our entry into the European Economic Community (e.c.), and it would comeinto operation at the same time as VAT.    I have long had in mind theadvantages of advancing the 1973 uprating from the Autumn to April,because of our entry into the e.c. and the introduction of VAT.    A decisionto do this obviously should not be announced now; but it might be advantageous to do so in the context of future e.c. debates, since thisshould give added reassurance to pensioners and other beneficiaries ofprotection from the price increases which they believed to be consequent on joining, and on the introduction of VAT.8. I invite my colleagues to endorse this alternative.A 3Treasury Chambers10 December 1971
ANNEXREVENUE CONSIDERATIONSPA YE does not apply to National Insurance pensions, but where a pensioner has other income within PA YE (eg an occupational pension or employment income), the code number for that income is,where possible, fixed so that the tax on the National Insurance pension is deducted from that income.    It follows that where National insurance pensions are increased, PA YE code numbers for pensioners have to be altered, if arrears of tax are to be avoided - as in this case they mustbe.    If an uprating takes effect at any other time than the beginning of a tax year (or thersabouts) the alteration of code numbers requires anadditional operation, involving over half million hours work in taxoffices. Such recoding work could not be done during 1972-73 sinceall available staff will be needed for the unification-receding.On the other hand, if an uprating takes effect from the beginningof a tax year, (and announced not later than the beginning of January),the new pensions can be dealt with in the normal annual recoding without an additional operation.
