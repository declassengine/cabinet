MS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 150COPY no 6 December 1971CABINETPROGRAMME ANALYSIS AND REVIEW: SELECTION OF TOPICSFOR 1972Memorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury.We introduced Programme Analysis and Review (PAR) to improvedecision-taking through better analysis.    In 1971 we have made usefulprogress in learning how to use it; some mistakes have also been madebut I remain convinced that PAR can play the role we envisaged for it.However this year we need to have a better and more balanced programme which is more closely related to the Governments overall objectives0And Ministers need to be more closely associated with the progress oftheir own PARs.2. In choosing topics account has been taken both of issues indentified in the Central Policy Review Staffs work on Government strategy, and ofthe &quot;programme structures&quot; of Departments (reflecting their main objectives and the programmes which relate to them), or where thelatter do not as yet exist of the main determinants of their expenditure.Topics so far agreed for 1972 PARs are:-Department of Education and Science Schools ExpenditureDepartment of Employment Redundancy PaymentsDepartment of Health and Social Security Short-Term NationalDepartment of the EnvironmentDepartment of Trade and IndustryHome office ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and food ministry of DefenceInsurance Benefits (witha considerable Departmentof Employment contributionon labour market effects ofthese benefits)The Elderly (second stage)Road SafetyAid to IndustryPolice ManpowerCapital Grants for horticulture andAgricultureReserve ForcesSatellite CommunicationsComputer policy
Notes on the likely scope of these studies are attached0    Departments willalso be undertaking further work on the development of programmestructures.3. In addition the Secretary of State for the Environment has underconsideration an additional major PAR on Urban Policy,    There is also likely to be a PAR on how to apply the recommendations of the AdamsCommittee on overseas aid objectives, if these are approved.    I havealso in mind an interdepartmental PAR on Rural Depopulation.    Finallythere are one or tv/o possible smaller PARs eg on Voluntary Effort.4. Further work by the Central Policy Review Staff on Governmentstrategy may well, following Cabinet discussion, lead tc the identificationof further subjects which ought to be studied within the PAR framework.There is nothing in the PAR arrangements to prevent such additions during1972.    Indeed, though an annual stocktaking will remain necessary, I thinkthat in future PAR topics should be identified at any time of the year for either immediate or suboequent study.    Meanwhile several PARs now inthe 1972 list will contribute to issues with which the strategy is likely tobe closely concerned (eg Aid to Industry;  Schools Expenditure; reserve forces;  the Elderly; Redundancy and Unemployment Benefits as regards their effects on the labour market; and Rural Depopulation in relation to regional and unemployment policy)0CONCLUSION5. We are publicly committed to making a success of the PAR system.For this reason, and on the merits, the 1972 programme must represent a significant advance on 197L    More important tlian numbers is the generalweight and quality of the programme, and whether it reflects topics of strategic interest and represents a fair balance across Government.My judgment is that it will satisfy these tests, but only if the mainadditions referred to in paragraph 3 above are made.     On this basisI invite my colleagues to approve the programme.M V treasury Chambers6 December 19712
annex proposed LIST OP PROGRAMMES FOR REVIEW IN 1 972DEPARTMENT OP EDUCATION AND science .     Schools Expenditure ( 1390m)This PAR would cover, inter alia, the future size of the teacher forceand the pupil/teacher ratio; in-service training of teachers; theschool building programme; physical equipment and non-teaching staff.All types of school provision (including nursery provision) in themaintained system would be covered.DEPARTMENT OP EMPLOYMENT2.     Redundancy Payments ( 50m public;  ,U5m private)This PAR would examine in detail the objectives and working of the redundancy Payments Scheme and would be co-ordinated with the DHSSPAR on short-term benefits (3 below).DEPARTMENT OP HEALTH AND SOCIAL SECURITY3.     The Structure and Level of Short-term National Insurance BenefitsThis study of national insurance short-term unemployment and sickness benefit would have regard to other forms of financial support, develop-niehts in related fields such as taxation and family provision, and thequestion of incentives.    The DE will share in this study withparticular reference to effects on industrial relations and employmentincluding mobility of labour.h.     Health and Personal Social Services for the Elderly ( 700m -excluding social security)This is a two-year PAR; an interim report is due to be presented thisyear.    It covers the wide range of services to the elderly providedby the NHS and the local authority personal social services, supported&quot;by social security and housing policy (DOE).   The interim report willset out a series of possible courses for developing policy and seekMinisterial guidance on which ones they wish to be investigated in 1972*
DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT5.     Road Safety (Net Public Expenditure  135-175m; private Bee tor 115m;  these are somewhat arbitrary estimates)This PAR would cover public expenditure directly related to safety(eg ROSPA^ and safety aspects of, for example, roads ex:expenditure.It would also cover private resource costs arising from Governmentsafety regulations.DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND industry.     Aid to Industry ( 380m)This would be a wide ranging review of the objectives, amounts and effectiveness of the various types of financial support for private industry including high technology industries.   Account would betaken of relevant fiscal incentives but measures aimed primarily atpromoting regional development would be excluded.    The precisescope of the review would require further detailed consideration.HOME office.     Police Manpower ( 350m)This PAR will probably cover the functions of a police force andits different branches, the basis for arriving at the size of a police establishment and the scope for replacing uniformed policeby traffic wardens and other civilians.MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD8.     Capital Grants for Horticulture and Agriculture ( 60m)The aim of the study would be to establish how far the contribution of these schemes to productivity can be identified, and tostrengthen the information base for reviewing domestic supportpolicies following entry into the Community.   MAFF consider thatthis study may not be completed in 1972.
MINISTRY OF DEFENCE9.     Reserve Forces (upwards of  55 million a year)This study will cover the requirement for reserve forces, their size, role and sources of manpower and the policy for their organisation, equipment and training.   It will take into accountquestions relating to deployment time which have formed partof the separate study on Reinforcement Forces (PAR 1971).10.    Defence Satellite Communications(Capital expenditure about  50 million).The study will be based on the need to retain a global securespeech communications network linking the Ministry of defence with major Defence Headquarters, overseas and with naval forcesat sea.    It will review the options for a successor system toSkynet II, arrangements for which are far advanced, and willexamine the implications, financial, industrial, operational andpolitical of a spectrum of policies ranging from a systemincorporating a UK designed satellite to total participation inthe US Defence Satellite Communication System.11.    The future of MOD Computer Policy (About  25 million a year)The Ministry of Defence have a proposal to do, within the next decade or so, all their administrative computing in a small numberof inter-connected centres with large machines.   A PAR study willexamine the major issues which this raises for MOD computingpolicy, including the provision of the necessary equipment.FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE:    OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENTADMINISTRATION / .ftlfl(whole programme:12.   Objectives of the Aid Programme:   Implementation ^ 230m)The objectives of the aid programme have been reviewed recentlyby an interdepartmental committee under the chairmanship ofSir Philip Adams.    The report is very shortly to be consideredby Ministers collectively, and if its recommendations are accepted, the 1972 PAR would consider how to apply them to the aid programme.NB   Neither the Scottish nor Welsh Offices would be undertakingseparate, specifically Scottish or Welsh PARs, but they would beparticipating as appropriate in the PARs undertaken by Whitehall.6 December 1971. confidential
