DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 14226 November, 1971CABINETCOTTON TEXTILE imports memorandum by the Secretary of State for trade and industry. I seek my colleague&apos;s agreement to retaining the presentquantitative restrictions on imports of cotton textiles from low-costcountries after 1 January in addition to the new tariff which will be imposed on such textiles from the Commonwealth Preference Area(there is already a duty on non-Commonwealth cotton textiles) on that day-    This would mean fairly large quotas for India, Hong Kong, and pakistan and more restricted access for about 70 other countries.2. In October 1970, the present Government endorsed the policy adopted by the Labour Government in July 1969 of giving the cottontextile industry only tariff protection from 1972 onwards.    This flowedfrom a recommendation by the industry&apos;s own Textile Council that iftariffs (at approximately the level of the European Economic Community1 s(e.c.) external tariff) were placed on Commonwealth imports, theUnited Kingdom industry could bring itself up to European standards of efficiency.    It was accepted that the industry would continue to shrink in size.3. I believe that this policy must now be modified because:-a. although mill closures and redundancies in Lancashirehave gone no faster than the Textile Council predicted, therehas been a concentration of closures recently and the generalstate of the economy makes it difficult at present for redundantworkers to get new jobs.    Unemployment in the Lancashirearea is now rather above the national average;b. there is already evidence of increased quantities of cheap textile imports in the pipeline for early next year.Once the requirement to introduce quantitative restrictionsunder the e.c. regime in 1973 (to which the ministerial committee on the Approach to Europe agreed on 25 October)becomes known we risk a further rise as suppliers rush tobuild up base positions;copy NO    g g
c.       the recent American restrictions on imports ofnon-cotton textiles must increase the general pressure ofimports on our market.4. Both we and the Labour Government told the Commons that whenthe new tariff was applied we would not retain a general quota system and would reintroduce quantitative restrictions on particular productsonly if total imports of cotton textiles rose and imports of these productscaused disruption.    The developing countries of the Commonwealth willprotest strongly.    But, although they are unlikely to admit it, I do notthink that our main traditional cotton textile suppliers, India and HongKong, will be much worse off than under a system of t?vi fs and no quotas.India will probably gain through being protected by the restrictions on more competitive suppliers like Korea and Taiwan.    Hong Kong will also gain in this way in the quantities of yarn and fabrics which she sells;  and willalso retain the financial benefit of the premium which exporters with a licence can charge in a restricted market.    She may lose by being helddown in the made-up sector where she is particularly competitive, buton balance I would expect her to come out about all square.5.        I am convinced that if we do not retain our present comprehensiverestraints the disruption to efficient Lancashire producers from the combination of the three factors outlined above would be such as to under-mine our objective of creating a viable and streamlined cotton textile industry.    My proposal is unlikely to help the smaller and less efficientfirms who are making most of the present political fuss, but it would also have considerable presentational advantages in the current unemployment situation.    The move will be welcome to e.c. who fear a further increasein the high level of textile imports we shall bring in with us, and it ohouldmake harmonisation to their system smoother.6.        Presentation is difficult, especially to international opinion.    Weare liable to be challenged on why we have reversed our policy so late inthe day.    The real reason is the inevitability of forestalling once it becomes known that e.c. quotas will apply in 1973.    But to say thispublicly invites attack for not having sought derogation (though forexcellent general negotiation reasons) from the requirement to adopt theCommunity system so soon.    The alternative of putting the main blameon unemployment is also risky because it lays us open to pressure for extra protection from other industries with higher unemployment than inLancashire.    I   think that as an opening line we can say that the three new factors in combination will result in a nearly certain rise in cotton textileimports next year to a level posing an intolerable threat to the industry and bring about a further rise in unemployment.    This situation could not before seen when the original decisions about tariffs and no quotas were made;in these circumstances the United Kingdom cannot sustain a more liberaltextile policy than the Community and other industrialised countries likethe United States; we shall still be taking a far higher proportion of low-cost textile imports than any other major industrial country.2
7. I ask my colleagues to endorse this line of presentation.    But ifpressed further, as I fear we shall be by the Commonwealth and by thePress, if not in Parliament, I think we shall have to say roundly that we did not seek a derogation because in all the circumstances we did not thinkit sensible to do so.8.        If quotas are to be retained this must be announced in the debate on 1 December on the Affirmative Resolution introducing the new tariff,which is part of the general Consolidation Order establishing the 1972Tariff.J d department of Trade and Industry26 November 19713
