HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNSC MAJESTYlS government cp(71) 137 COPY NO18 November 1971CABINETEUROPEAN legislation memorandum by the Lord President of the council. On the basis of preparatory work condticted under the Solicitor-General, I have discussed with the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster and other Ministers concerned the structure of the European legislation.2. The purpose of the legislation is to put us in a position to complywith the obligations of membership of the Communities, and we must bein this position before we ratify the Treaty of Accession.    The legislationmust therefore give the force of law in this country to those treaty provisions and Community instruments which are intended to have directinternal effect in Member States: for example, the Communityregulations fixing the rates of agricultural levies under the common agricultural policy (CAP).    This can be achieved by a general provision, and there is no question of re-enacting all the directlyapplicable law, though we shall need provisions to supplement it: forexample, to set up an intervention agency under the CAP.    But theCommunity also operates to a large extent through directives which require national legislation to achieve their purposes: for instance thedirectives harmonising food standards and company law.    Under anumber of directives we have some choice in the implementing procedureor machinery.3. The required changes in our law are extensive.    It would beimpossible to deal with them all by statutory provisions, with direct andprecise amendment of all the statutes concerned.    In any case many ofthe changes are minor.    The legislation should confer a general powerto make by subordinate legislation any provision needed to comply withour obligations or enjoy our rights under the Treaties.4. It would be theoretically possible to rely entirely on a power of subordinate legislation.    The legislation would then consist of a verysmall number of basic constitutional clauses conferring the necessarypower and containing the essential provisions &quot;o^llnancraTTTiTatters, andNorthern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.    In our judgement this would not be politically tolerable and would not in practicesave time.    Certain changes which must be made to our law are funda-mental and in many cases controversial.    The provisions needed to operate the CAP and to move towards Community tariffs are central to community membership, and in several other areas we need to make
substantial changes, including the establishment of new enforcementsystems.    Other provisions have less practical impact but deal withsuch sensitive areas as the application of the Official Secrets Act toEURATOM secrets and the rights of Community inspectors to enterpremises.5. To leave all such provisions to subordinate legislation wouldrequire a power of virtually unlimited scope.    Such a power, and thepurposes to which it was clearly going to be put, would create a storm ofobjections, on the ground that it was constitutionally improper.6. We recommend a middle course with the following main features:-a. The substantive legislation should contain expressprovisions on the matters of importance and controversy,and the provisions needed to adapt or clear away regulatoryprovisions so that the Community system can operate or tomake clear that existing safeguards are preserved.b. The form of the legislation should be considerably slimmed.On some matters all that is needed is an entry in a repealschedule or a minor adaptation of an existing power.    We can also include minor provisions and statutory repeals which wouldnot significantly affect the passage of the legislation through parliament.c. The general power of subordinate legislation should be tiedclosely to Treaty obligations and rights.    Even this will arousesuspicion, but we shall have established on the face of the Bill a pattern of what ought in future to be embodied in substantivelegislation.d. There should be standard provisions on penalties, rightsof entry and other sensitive matters, so as further to restrict the implied scope of the general power.e. Changes not needed immediately should be deferred tolater legislation.f. There would still be some provisions left entirely to subordinate legislation.7. Our present view is that the legislation should be contained in asingle Bill, which should if possible be ready immediately after the christmas recess.    The alternative is to have one short Bill containing the basic constitutional provisions (paragraph 4) with the other provisions in a second, longer Bill, but this course would re-open more starkly thegeneral issue of principle decided last month.
8. There are various tactical considerations in the handling of eitherone or two Bills which the Cabinet may wish to discuss and on which theChief Whip will be ready to speak.9.        I invite the Cabinet to agree that the European legislation shouldbe drafted on the lines indicated in paragraph 6 above.W w privy Council Office18 November 19713
