JUS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 149 COPY NO g46 December 1971CABINETNATIONALISED INDUSTRY policy memorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury. On 27 May 1971 (CM(7l) 29th Conclusions, Minute 7) the Chancellorof the Exchequer was invited to consider further ways of securingimproved financial control over the nationalised industries.    these were to include the concept of a Public Sector Finance Corporation (PSFC),which might control the allocation of capital made available by the treasury to the industries and aim ultimately to attract private capital to them.2, This concept requires less &quot;managerial&quot; intervention by theGovernment, together with a greater degree of &quot;directorial&quot; or &quot;board&quot;control, based on better information being more readily available to theGovernment; which in turn means that improved methods of accountabilityand control within the nationalised industries should first be worked outwith them.    Colleagues have generally agreed that these policies shouldhave two, objects:a. The nationalised industries should corne as near as possibleto satisfying the same criteria as the private sector in attractingcapital (whether from the Exchequer or from the market);requiring the Government to apply, as far as possible, marketcriteria to the allocation of resources to them.b. The Government (whatever machinery it employs for thispurpose) should have the power and the means to ensure, withthe minimum dislocation through detailed intervention, that the nationalised industries comply with the broader needs of national policy.PRESENT POSITION OF NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES3. The inevitable conflict between these two objects is seen in theapplication to the nationalised industries of a particularly stringent policyof price restraint in support of the Confederation of British Industryinitiative.    This was necessary;  but it has brought a serious setbackto progress in making the nationalised industries viable.    The ministers concerned are now starting discussions with the various Boards to settlewhat financial help they need as a result.1
IMMEDIATE ACTION4.        In these circumstances it would not be realistic to start discussions on devolving statutory responsibilities to, or seeking private capitalthrough, a FSFC.    But there is some action that can be taken at once.The steps to improve control and accountability, which were set out inthe Chancellor of the Exchequers earlier paper (CP(7l) 62) should, Ibelieve, be implemented.    This would not require any public announcement.I suggest also that the Ministers concerned should consider the various possibilities for denationalisation contained in Annex 3 to that paper.    Inaddition I believe we should consider an alternative to a PSFC, which wouldlater evolve in that direction.THE GOVERNMENT AS ENTREPRENEUR5, Events since May 1971 have emphasised the need to equip theGovernment to carry out its &quot;entrepreneurial&quot; functions more effectively.Discussions on suggested organisations such as a Regional DevelopmentAgency and Shipbuilding Agency indicate that this need extends to the relationship between the Government and those private sector concernsin which large sums of public money are at risk.    It is in any case likelyto be required by future policies for full employment involving additions to,and changes in, the pattern of public industrial investment in both the public and the private sector.6. I therefore believe that urgent attention should be given to the typeQf central organisation immediately required to handle the problems ofpublic investment in, and assistance to, industry (in both public and private sectors) in conjunction with any other organisations, regional or sectional,that have been, or may in future be, under consideration.    Such an organisation could approach the activities of the nationalised industriesgradually:  starting with those parts which were in a position to attractprivate capital, or which could without legislation be transformed, in wholeor in part, into Companies Act companies;  or with existing subsidiarieswhich could be transferred to it without legislation.conclusion. To sum up, I recommend that:a. The Ministers concerned should be invited:i. To carry out as rapidly as possible the steps to improvecontrol and accountability set out in CP(7l) 62.ii. To consider which of the various proposals fordenationalisation, set out in Annex B to that paper,should be pursued in present circumstances.b. The broader objective for the next few years should be tomake good the setback resulting from the effects of price restraint on the finances of the nationalised industries.
c.    Urgent consideration should be given to the possibleestablishment of a central organisation on the basis suggestedin paragraph 6 above to handle the management of public investment in selected industrial enterprises.M V treasury Chambers6 December 19713
