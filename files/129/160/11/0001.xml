report from theSELECT COMMITTEE OK THE CIVIL LISTREPORTThe Select Committee appointed to consider Her Majcsty&apos;s most GraciousMessage of the 19th May in the last Session of Parliament relating to the Civil list and other matters connected therewith, have considered the matters to themreferred, and have agreed to the following Report: introduction. In performing the duty entrusted to them Your Committee and their pre-predecessors in the last session have had before them the Papers laid before the Hotiseof Commons, by Her Majesty&apos;s command, and referred to them by the House.The Papers, which are printed as an Appendix to this Report, contain information on the actual expenditure from the Civil List since Her Majesty&apos;s accession andother information on related financial matters affecting the Monarchy.The 1952 Settlement2. Your Committee first examined the arrangements established by the civil list Act 1952.   These provide a total annual payment of  475,000, as follows:   per annumClass I.    Her Majesty&apos;s Privy Purse............      60,000Class II.   Salaries of Her Majesty&apos;s Household      ......     185,000Class IN. Expenses of Her Majesty&apos;s Household    ......     121,800Class IV.  Royal bounty, aims and special services......      13,200Class V.   Supplementary provision   ...      .........      95,000Of the Supplementary provision of  95,000 a year in Class V, up to  25,000 is available for contributions towards the expenses of the performance of dutiespertaining to the Royal Family by those of Their Royal Highnesses for whomParliament has made no provision. .Thc balance is available to meet any excessof the audited expenditure under Classes il and III over the allocations to thoseclasses as set out above; any remaining surplus in the early years being accumulatedby the Royal Trustees to meet excesses in later years. The relevant statutory provisions are in Section 9 of the Act; an analysis of the use of Class V is set outin Statements 1, IV and V of the Appendix.3. There is no separate Parliamentary provision for His Royal Highness the prince of Wales who is now entitled as Duke of Cornwall to the whole of the netrevenues of the Duchy of Cornwall. The Prince of Wales undertook in 1969 (whenhe came of age) to make a voluntary surrender of 50 per cent of the Duchy of cornwall revenues to the Consolidated Fund. The proportion is subject to review on his marriage or in the event of some other change of circumstances.4. The Civil List Act 1952 includes certain provisions in relation to the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall during the minority of the Duke. The effect of these provisions was that the Duke would receive one-ninth part of the revenues up to 475,000
Vi REPORT FROM THEthe age of 18 and  30.000 per annum from 18* to 21. The balance of the revenueswere applied in relief of the Civil List and the issues from the Consolidated Fundwere reduced accordingly. Statement VI sets out the amount of the revenues andtheir disposal for each year since 1952.5. The Act includes a number of provisions for other members of the royal family, separately from the Civil List. The current effect of this Act and ofcertain provisions remaining from previous Civil List Acts, is as follows: Act	  per	annum1937, S.3	Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother ...	70,0001952, S.3	H.R.H. The Duke of Edinburgh.........	40,0001952, S.4	H.R.H. The Princess Anne............	6,000	 increasing in the event of her marriage to	15,0001952, S.5	H.R.H. The Princess Margaret    .........	15,0001937, S.6		1937, S.4	H.R.H. The Duke of Gloucester.........	35,0001910, S.5		The provisions of Section 4 of the 1952 Act authorise payments in respect of her majesty&apos;s younger sons of  10,000 per annum from the age of 1 Si&quot; until marriage and 25,000 per annum after marriage; and payments in respect of any daughter ofHer Majesty of  6,000 per annum from the age of I Si&quot; until marriage and  15,000per annum after marriage. In accordance with these arrangements an annuitywould become payable for His Royal Highness The Prince Andrew in 1978, and forHis Royal Highness The Prince Edward in 1982. The Act also provides, inSection 6, for an annuity of  30,000 to any widow of the Duke of Cornwall.These annuities are specifically charged on the Consolidated Fund and are liable total in the ordinary way; but the Treasury in the exercise of their statutory powers;exempt such part as in their opinion represents a fair equivalent of the average annual amount laid out and expended wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties in respect of which the annuities are payable.6. Section 7 of the Civil List Act 1952 authorises the payment by the Treasuryof pensions etc. to staff of the Royal Household who have retired; they aregenerally awarded on a basis analogous with Civil Service practice. The amountspaid each year including those in respect of pensions awarded in previous reignsare set out in Statement VIII.7. Section 13 of the Civil List Act 1952 and corresponding provisions in earlierActs authorise the payment from the Consolidated Fund of what have long been known as Civil List pensions although since 1837 the provision made for them has been separate from and additional to the Parliamentary grant for The Queen&apos;civil List. These pensions have no connection with those referred to in thepreceding paragraph. They are granted, in the words of the 1837 Act, &quot; to such persons only as have just claims on the Royal Beneficence, or who by their personal services to the Crown, by the performance of duties to the public, or by theiruseful discoveries in science, attainments in literature and the arts, have merited* Under Section 10(1) of the Family Law Reform Act 1969, the Duke is now entitled to thewhole of the net revenues at age 18.t Reduced from 21 in accordance with Section 19(2) of the Family Law Reform Act 1969.J Section 191 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 (preserved by para 28 of schedule 14 of thai Act) and corresponding provisions of previous Income Tax Acts.
the Gracious consideration of their Sovereign and the gratitude of their countryNowadays these categories are interpreted as meaning services to science, literature,music and the arts and are awarded at the discretion of the Prime Minister. The1952 Act limits the amount of new and increased pensions which may be awardedeach year to  5,000; the amounts actually paid each year are recorded inStatement IX.8. Certain expenditure arising from the official activities of the Royal Familyis borne finally on the Votes of certain Government Departments. This expenditurecomprises:(a) Royal travel at home and overseas on official duties, including the RoyalYacht and The Queen&apos;s Flight.(b) Maintenance etc. of palaces and certain residences occupied by membersof the Royal Family.(c) Stationery and office equipment for the Royal Household.(d) Ceremonial and equerry attendance.The figures included in 1971-72 Estimates for each of these items are: (i) 01,789,000(ii)&apos;  974,000(iii)  46,000(iv)  71,000In addition postal and telecommunications charges for the Royal Householdestimated at  52,000 and previously borne by the Post Office as a GovernmentDepartment are currently being provided free of charge by the Post OlliceCorporation.   Details of all this expenditure are set our in Statement X.9. Section I of the Civil List Act 1952 provides for the hereditary revenues,as defined, to be paid into the Consolidated Fund during the present Reign and aperiod of six months afterwards. The sums so paid into the Consolidated fund in respect of the Crown Estate are set out in Statement XI and in respect of theother branches of the hereditary revenues in Statement Xlf. Your Committeenoted that the amounts paid into the Consolidated Fund had approximatelyquadrupled since the coming into operation of the 1952 Act.The Present Situation . ,10. Your Committee first condidered the developments over the past two decadessince 1952 which have led to the provision then made now proving inadequate.Between 1953 and 1970 wages have on average increased by 126 per cent and consumer prices by 74 per cent. These developments have been reflected in steadyincreases in Royal Household expenditure in class 11 (wages and salaries) andClass III (expenses of the Household). Details of expenditure under these headsare shown in Statements II and III attached to this Report. Such increases havegradually absorbed the contingency provision which during the first few years ofthe reign accumulated in the hands of the Royal Trustees. Statement I shows thattotal Civil List expenditure exceeded the statutory figure of  475,000 during 1962and from that point the surplus accumulated by the Royal Trustees was drawn upon to meet the increasing deficits in each subsequent year. By 1970 total civil list expenditure had reached  745,000 and only  30,000 remained in the reserve
will REPORT FROM THEto add to the annual payment of  475,000 from the Consolidated Fund. the resulting deficit of  240,000 was met by the Privy Purse. The deficit is expectedto increase by  100.000 during the current year so that by the end of 1971 the tota[call on the Privy Purse will reach  600,000. (&apos;11. The possibility of such a situation arising had of course been foreseen by the1952 Committee who commented in para. 6 of their report:*&quot; (Your Committee) trust that the financial provision, including the contin-gencies margin, which they are proposing, will be adequate to enable the sovereign and the other members of the Royal Family to discharge their duties in a manner fully in keeping with the honour and dignity of the crown and to relieve Her Majesty of any avoidable financial anxiety. If, however,any considerable change should take place either in the burden of publicfunctions laid upon Her Majesty or in the level of prices, it would be incomplete accordance with constitutional practice for Her Majesty to send afurther Gracious Message to Parliament asking that the original grant shouldbe reconsidered.&quot;12. By 1969 it had become apparent that the situation envisaged by the 1952Committee would arise during 1970 and on 11th November, !9&amp;9 the then PrimeMinister made a statement to the House of Commons in which, having reviewed the position which had been reached, he stated &quot; Accordingly, detailed discussion took place between Treasury officials and The Queen&apos;s advisers, as a result of whichthe Government informed The Queen&apos;s advisers that a new Select Committeewould be appointed at the beginning of the next Parliament.&quot;! On 18th May, 1971Her Majesty addressed Gracious Messages to both Houses of Parliament and two days later the House of Commons resolved to appoint Your Committee to considerthe Gracious Message relating to the Civil List and other matters connected therewith and to report.Evidence13. Your Committee first took evidence from those most directly concerned withthe expenditure of the Royal Household; the Lord Chamberlain, the Keeper ofthe Privy Purse, and the Deputy Treasurer to The Queen. This evidence covered the organisation of financial responsibility within the Royal Household, the distinction between expenditure incurred by The Queen as Head of State and thatfinanced by the Privy Purse, and the financial arrangements in respect of othermembers of the Royal Family.14. Evidence on the administration and organisation of the Royal Household,and the possibility of further operational economies, was given by the Administra-tive Adviser, Sir Basil Smallpeice. Evidence on behalf of the Royal Household wasalso given by the Private Secretary to The Queen, covering the burden of work involved in the functions carried out by Her Majesty in person and the extent towhich some of those functions were shared by other members of the Royal Family.15. The Auditor of the Civil List, and Treasury and Inland Revenue representa-tives gave evidence on the tax position of The Queen and of the other membersof the Royal Family. The Treasury also submitted papers on Civil List Pensionsand Royal Household pensions. Witnesses representing the Crown EstateCommission, the Duchy of Cornwall and the Duchy of Lancaster gave evidence* H.C.224, 1951-52.+ H.C. Deb. 791, 1969-70, col. 184.
select committee on the civil liston the administration of these hereditary estates and the revenue from thesesources. Representatives of the Civil Service Union gave evidence about the pay and conditions of service of the grades which they represent among Palace stall.All these witnesses gave both written and oral evidence to Your Committee.Written evidence was also submitted at Your Committee&apos;s request by the Ministryof Defence regarding the Royal Yacht and the Royal Flight, and by the Departmentof the Environment about the Royal Palaces and the Royal Train and other officialtravel by rail.The Official Duties of The Queen16. As indicated in para. 11 above, the 1952 Committee recognised that a review might be required not only as a result of price increases, but in the light ofany considerable change in the burden of public functions laid upon Her Majesty.Your Committee therefore obtained a full account, mainly from the private secretary to The Queen, of the duties and functions of Her Majesty and othermembers of the Royal Family in carrying out official engagements both in theUnited Kingdom and abroad.17. The Queen&apos;s own duties in Her capacity as Sovereign of the United Kingdom,and of the ten other self-governing Commonwealth Monarchies and the remainingcolonial Territories; and as Supreme Governor of the Church of England and her special responsibility to the Established Church of Scotland, fall under fourmain heads. First there is the work arising from the normal operations ofGovernment in the form of information she receives both from Ministers at homeand representatives abroad, and submissions which she has to approve and sign.The Queen receives copies of all important Government papers reports fromAmbassadors and Ministers abroad and instructions or replies from the ForeignOffice, copies of Parliamentary papers, copies of memoranda and minutes ofCabinet meetings and minutes of all important conferences such as meetings of commonwealth Ministers. There.is therefore a continuing burden of unseenwork involving some hours reading of papers each day in addition to Her Majesty&apos;smore public duties. Secondly, The Queen receives a large number of importantpeople privately. These include those about to be appointed to, or retire from,senior public posts. She also frequently receives the Prime. Minister and other ministers. She also holds meetings of the Privy Council and some 14 investitureseach year at which she personally bestows over 2,000 orders, decorations andmedals. Thirdly, The Queen attends numerous State occasions such as theOpening of Parliament, Trooping the Colour, Armistice Day and various services at St PauPs Cathedral and Westminster Abbey. There are many engagementsboth public and private involving visits to all pails of the United Kingdom, manyof them including visits to local universities, hospitals, factories and units of the armed forces. Fourthly, Her Majesty is directly involved both in State visits tothis country of the Heads of Foreign and Commonwealth States of which therehave been more than 20 since the beginning of Her reign, and in tours and visitsoverseas to Commonwealth countries and in State Visits to foreign countries, ofwhich there have so far been over 30. in particular Her Majesty&apos;s programme-has increasingly included visits for specific occasions to monarchical countries ofthe Commonwealth. The Queen also has a variety of public commitments in Hercapacity as Head of the Armed Services.
report from theThe Official Duties of other Members of the Royal Family18. While much of the work which The Queen undertakes cannot be delegated to others, the total burden of work arising from the functions of the Crown is such that no one could carry it single handed. The Duke of Edinburgh and othermembers of the Royal Family therefore take a considerable share of the burdenof official duties wherever this is practicable. In some cases they act directly on her Majesty&apos;s behalf. In The Queen&apos;s absence abroad they act as Counsellorsof State and as such exercise certain of the functions of the Monarch. By statutethis is a duty which they alone can discharge. They conduct Investitures in TheQueerfs absence abroad and represent Her at services or celebrations in thiscountry, and in other cases they carry out public engagements on their own account at home and abroad in response to invitations from governments and from public and private institutions. At their request, Your Committee were informed indetail of the public engagements carried out by certain members of the royal family in 1970. The support given to Her Majesty in this way includes the carrying out of engagements which in some cases run into many hundreds a yearand which in total amounted to over 1,600 in 1970. This assistance is not confined to those for whom separate financial provision is made under the Civil List Acts.This burden has been increasing and Your Committee sees no sign of its being reduced. On the contrary they believe that the country welcomes the active participation of the Royal Family in its public life and that the pressure for furtherpublic engagements will continue to grow. As the younger members of the royal family grow up it will be possible to share the work among a greater number,but other members of the Royal Family will be growing older and will before longhave to face the need to withdraw to an increasing degree from the full range of commitments which they now undertake. Your Committee, being satisfied thatthe scope of the official duties cf Her Majesty and other members of the royal family is substantial and increasing, next considered the manner in which the associated expenditure should be financed.The Royal Finances19. The three broad categories of Royal expenditure are: Her Majesty&apos;s public expenditure as Sovereign; Her Majesty&apos;s private expenditure as Sovereign; and her Majesty&apos;s personai expenditure as a private individual. The first is financed by the Civil List, the second by the Privy Purse, and the third from The Queen&apos;sown personal resources. The nature of the expenditure under these heads is broadly as follows. The Civil List meets the costs of stair and expenses incurredwherever the Court is in residence in providing for the official duties of The Queenas Head of State, together with certain small items of Royal Charity, and some contribution towards certain other members of the Royal Famiiy. The detailsof this expenditure are shown in Statements I to IV of the Appendix. The PrivyPurse meets the cost of private expenditure arising from Her Majesty&apos;s respon-sibilities as Head of State, for creating a pension fund for past and present employees of The Queen and Her Family not otherwise provided for, for the maintenance ofSandringham and Balmoral, for further assistance to members of the Royal Familyin meeting their official expenses, for charitable subscriptions and donations, andfor welfare and amenity purposes for staff of the Royal Household. That partof the Privy Purse revenue not required for these purposes has been used to create a contingency reserve which has helped to meet the Civil List deficits arising in1970 and 1971 amounting in total to  600,000. As for The Queen&apos;s expenditure as a private individual Your Committee were informed and think it right to mention
that Her Majesty lias made considerable contributions from Her private resources,in addition to contributions from the Privy Purse, to meet the increasing cost,due to inflation, of official expenses of other members of the Royal Family (both those in receipt of specific payments and those financed from Class V of theCivil List).20. There is, therefore, no question in any ordinary sense of a &quot; pay increase &quot;for The Queen. Indeed, in Her Gracious Message Her Majesty has intimated that she is content to forgo the present payment of  60,000 per annum to the PrivyPurse from Class I of the Civil List. The Civil List is not a form of &quot; salary &quot;payable in respect of the Queen&apos;s public duties, but a reimbursement of the operating expenses of the official part of the Royal Household. The present needfor an increase in the Civil List arises very &quot;largely from pay increases grantedsince 1952, not to The Queen or members of the Royal Family, but to the Palacestaff. At the time Your Committee were appointed and subsequently, a number ofpublic references were made to the supposed size of the Queetvs private resources.In view of this the Lord Chamberlain thought it right in his evidence to point outthat many of the suggestions made seemed to be based on a misunderstanding. Itis true that the Royal Palaces, the Crown Jewels, and the Royal Collectionscould be regarded as of astronomical value. But these are vested in the Sovereignand cannot be alienated. This means that they must all be passed on to her majesty&apos;s successor, and they are therefore in no sense Her personal property.The Sandringham and Balmoral estates are the personal property of The Queen,but it is to be noted that, when Her Majesty is in residence there, she continuesto carry out Her constitutional and official duties and takes the necessary staffwith Her. There is no foundation for the suggestions which have been made insome quarters that apart from these items. The Queen owns private funds whichmay now run into such figures as  50 millions or more. Your Committee were assured that these suggestions are wildly exaggerated, and have thought it right to incorporate this assurance in their report.The Civil List21. Turning new to provision for the Civil List, Your Committee firstconsidered possible means of reducing the total Civil List requirement, both byway of further economies in expenditure by the Royal Household, and by thetransfer of appropriate items of expenditure to departmental Votes. your committee were satisfied that on the basis of the evidence they received there was little further scope for economies in the Royal Household. They accept the viewboth of those Members of the Household who gave evidence and of the CivilService Union that it would not be right in today&apos;s circumstances to expect Palaceemployees to be paid at a lower level than would be appropriate for correspondingwork elsewhere. And they consider that savings should not be achieved bysubstantially reducing the scale or style of Royal occasions and appearances.22. As regards possible further transfers to Votes, the position now is, as shownin Statement X of the Appendix, that more than three quarters of the total cost of services connected with the Monarchy is already borne on Votes and the numberof possibilities remaining for further transfers is therefore limited. In considering these Your Committee had to have regard to considerations of public account-ability. It would be wrong to seek to transfer expenditure onto a Vote for whichthe Accounting Officer could not be held responsible by the Public accounts committee because of lack of direct operational responsibility.  However, it has
xii REPORT FROM THEbeen found possible to identify two cases for which it seems right to transfer responsibility for payment, and control, to a Government Department. The first of these concerns responsibility for the whole cost of Stale Visits to this country,which are at present financed in part from the Civil List. The second relates tothe costs connected with the Royal Victorian Order, which may conveniently beincluded with the costs of the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthoodalready reimbursed from the Votes for Miscellaneous Expenses. Allowing forthese transfers, Your Committee were informed that Civil List expenditure on the salaries and Expenses of the Royal Household in 1972 would be about  810,000.The problem then is how provision at this level can be made for an indefinitefuture period allowing for the likelihood of future changes in prices and incomes.Possible solutions23. In principle there are three ways of tackling this problem short of attempting now to forecast a probable rale of inflation for the whole of theremainder of the reign, which is clearly impracticable. Firstly the legislation could provide for an annual payment of  810,000 to be made from the consolidate fund with the addition of a contingency margin calculated to exceed requirements in the early years which would allow the creation of a reserve which would bedrawn on in the later years. This is the basis of the arrangements under the civil list Act 1952, described in para. 2 above. Secondly the legislation could providefor payments from the Consolidated Fund to be automatically adjusted each yearby reference to the movement in some specified index reflecting inflation. Thirdlythe legislation could provide that either the whole of the annual provision, or thesum by which the original amount needed to be increased, should be met froman annual Vote, as is clone for ordinary Departmental expenditure.24. Your Committee considered schemes based on each of these approaches.Each scheme was considered against what appeared to Your Committee to be the major objectives to be achieved. These were:(i) to provide adequate but not excessive finance for Royal Householdexpenditure year by year taking account of future changes in wages and prices.(ii) to avoid if at all possible the need for any further Civil List legislation during the present reign.(iii) to avoid annual involvement of Parliament while providing a periodicalopportunity for Parliament to review the arrangements to ensure thatthey were achieving the intended objective.25. Your Committee did not find il necessary to consider in detail a schemebased on the first of the three approaches mentioned above the provision of a fixed contingency margin estimated to be big enough to, meet future inflation forthe whole of the rest of the reign. In present circumstances it would not be possibleto determine the proper size for such a contingency margin, as the breakdown ofthe 1952 arrangements had shown. Simply to up-date the 1952 figures, with a comparable contingency margin, could not be relied upon to meet the requirements for the rest of the reign. It would not, therefore, meet the second criterion setout above.26. Your Committee gave more detailed consideration to the possibilities ofindex linking (the second of the approaches referred to in para. 23). Such anarrangement could take a number of forms. It could, for example, be based on
C* i S     rT5     &quot;fSELECT COMMITTEE ON THE CIVIL LISTXlllsome general index of price movements in the economy as a whole, or in morespecialised indices reflecting movements in the main items of costs incurred bythe Royal Household, or it could be based on movements in the level of the hereditary revenues surrendered by The Queen in 1952, particularly the CrownEstate revenues^orthc use of different indices in respect of different parts of civil list expenditure. In each case the main attraction of the scheme would be thatit would provide increasing sums without any need for further action, on the partof Parliament. Against this attraction, however, there appeared to your committee to be considerable drawbacks. Such a scheme could not in the longrun guarantee precise conespondence between expenditure and income. Move-ments in the index whichever index was chosen, would not necessarily followmovements in Royal Household expenditure with absolute precision in anyparticular year, not only because the components of Royal Household expenditure are not the same as those of any available published index, but because there could still be changes in future years, as there have been already since 1952, in the extent and nature of Royal commitments and therefore of the requirement for finance.In other words, any index link scheme assumes that the pattern of Royal Householdexpenditure will remain in future broadly as it is now and that the only changes will be those due to inflation. This assumption is unrealistic. Such a scheme would not therefore meet the first criterion set out in para. 24 above.27. Your Committee also considered in some detail the third approachmentioned in para. 23 to rely on annual Votes either for the whole of Royalexpenditure, now met out of the Consolidated Fund, or for that part of it arisingfrom future increases in costs. These two variants of the scheme would be very different in certain respects but they would share the main advantages and disadvantages of reliance on Vote provision. The advantage would be that financial provision in each year could be matched to the expenditure expected forthat year and there would be no long-term problem of a divergence betweenrevenue and expenditure. Such a scheme could therefore be guaranteed to avoid the need for any further legislation during the reign. Against this, however, itwould entail action by Parliament every year. The aim of all previous Civil Listsettlements has been to make provision for Royal Household expenditure for thewhole of a reign, and Your Committee attach great importance, as did their predecessors without exception, to maintaining this position. They feel that itwould be quite wrong to allow the inflationary developments of the last 19 years,for which Her Majesty has no responsibility, to result in changes in the provisionfor the Civil List which undermine the basic principle on which, on all previous occasions, Civil List provision has been made.Conclusion on the Civil List28. Your Committee concluded that none of the schemes described in thepreceding paragraphs would serve the purpose in view. They therefore consideredan alternative possibility under which the arrangements adopted in 1952 might be modified by providing for periodical review and updating by Parliament, otherthan on an annual basis. The main features of such an arrangement would be:(i) provision would continue to be made solely by way of charge on the consolidated Fund.(ii) the annual provision would include, over and above the amount estimated to be required for the first year, a fixed contingency margin calculated tobe sufficient for a period of some years.
xiv report from the(iii) any excess over requirements in the early years of the period would be invested by the Royal Trustees until required, on the lines of the 1952arrangements.(iv) after a period of some years, on the basis of a report by the Royal Trustees,the Government of the day would review the progress of expenditure onthe Civil List and, if it appeared necessary, would propose an increaseestimated to be sufficient for a further period.(v) the increase would be made by an Order laid before Parliament by treasury Ministers and would not involve the appointment of a SelectCommittee.29. In this way the need for annual Votes would be avoided but parliament would have the opportunity of exercising a periodic oversight of the arrangements and the level of provision required. Your Committee have reached the conclusionthat there should be a maximum period of ten years between the reviews. they see considerable advantage in leaving some discretion to the Government of theday, so that in the event of the contingency margin proving sufficient for a ten year period it would not be necessary to hold a review earlier, while if the rate of risein costs had been underestimated, a review could be held before the end of thatperiod. They therefore recommend that the legislation should provide for a reportby the Royal Trustees, when necessary and in any event not less frequently than once every ten years. Following such a report, which would be laid beforeParliament, the Government of the day would if necessary propose an increase by means of an Order effective from the succeeding 1 January.30. It is clearly impracticable to predict the future rate of rise in costs andconsequently to determine an amount which would last for a specified period. Tosome extent, therefore, any figures which are taken for the purpose of such acalculation must be arbitrary. However, an annual sum has to be fixed and, inall the circumstances, Your Committee recommend annual provision from 1st January, 1972 for the Salaries and Expenses of the Royal Household of 980,000. It will be appreciated from para. 28(iii) that, in the event of this annualsum being more than sufficient for the audited expenditure over the decade, it willbe carried forward by the Royal Trustees and be available to finance expenditurein the succeeding decade. If it proves to be insufficient before the decade has elapsed, the sum can be increased under the arrangements suggested in para. 28(iv)and (y).* If, at the end of the reign, there were a sum of money remaining in thehands of the Royal Trustees it would, in accordance with Section 9(6) of the civil list Act 1952, fall to be dealt with in such manner as Parliament might thereafterdetermine. We consider that the sum of  10,200 now provided via Class IV of I heCivil List for Royal bounty, alms and special services, should be found from withinthe total of  980,000.Oilier members of the Royal Family31. As noted in para. 5 above, five members of the Royal Family other than the queen currently receive annuities charged directly on the Consolidated Fund underlhe Civil List Acts. Your Committee had to consider whether these amounts were still appropriate and whether some arrangements should be introduced for futureadjustment of these payments. The justification for annuities of this sort istwofold. It hikes account of the fact that these members of the Royal Familytake a share in the burden of work placed on The Queen; but it also representscompensation for the fact that The Queen&apos;s closest relatives, by reason of their
position so near to the Throne either now or during an earlier reign, are precluded from earning a living in the various ways open to the rest of the community. this restriction docs not however apply automatically to other members of the royal family, less close to The Queen, who may prefer to follow an independent careerof their own rather than to undertake a part of the Royal functions. In those cases a specific contribution from public funds would be inappropriate. your committee regard this as a valid distinction, and recommend a continuation ofthe existing arrangements in this respect. Your Committee however, in confiningtheir recommendation in respect of specific grants to the members of the royal family who were specified in the Civil List Act 1952, would not wish to be under-stood as thereby failing to appreciate the work done by other members of theRoyal Family. They feel however that provision can be more flexibly made bythe alternative method recommended.32. The amounts of the annuities for The Queen&quot;s closest relatives have so far been fixed almost entirely by precedent and the amounts payable during the presentreign are largely based on comparable provision made in the past. But as in thecase of the Civil List itself, the amounts provided in 1952 have become increasinglyinadequate and The Queen has had to make provision both from the Privy Purseand from Her private resources to supplement these sums. The expenditureconcerned is of course closely comparable with that covered by the Civil List itself in respect of the Royal Household in that much of it comprises the salaries and expenses incurred in carrying out the official duties undertaken by the members ofeach Household. As indicated in paragraph 18, Your Committee have beenprovided with evidence of the duties carried out by those for whom this provision is made and Your Committee are satisfied that the amounts currently provided are inadequate. This is also evident from the fact that, in three cases, the Treasiryhad used the powers mentioned in para. 5 to exempt the whole amount from tax and that in the other two cases the amount exempted was 80 per cent and almost95 per cent respectively. Your Committee therefore propose that the amounts ofthe annuities in these cases should be as follows:  Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother      ......    95,000H.R.H. The Duke of Edinburgh........,      ......    65,000H.R.H. The Princess Anne...      ...............    15,000H.R.H. The Princess Margaret    ................    35,000H.R.H. The Duke of Gloucester............&apos;     ...    45,00033. Provision was made in the Civil List Act 1952 for a number of other categories of contingent future payments and Your Committee propose that these should be increased to the following amounts: ...      -Younger sons at age 18 and before marriage    ..........   20,000Younger sons after marriage...............   50,000Daughters at age 18 and before marriage.........    15,000Daughters after marriage..................   35,000Widow of H.R.H. The Prince of Wales............   60,000naiafc
xvi report from theHer Majesty requested in Her Gracious Message that provision be made forH.R.H. The Duchess of Gloucester or any future wife of a younger son in theevent of any of them surviving her husband. Your Committee are satisfied of theneed for such a provision and propose that the annual amount payable in thesecircumstances should be fixed at  20,000.34. As regards the remaining members of the Royal Family, who still have a choice between an independent career and taking a share of the Royal functions,Your Committee recommend the continuance of the existing arrangements underwhich individual payments are made from a global sum specified in the Act. Anannual sum of  60,000 should be sufficient for this purpose; payment should bemade, however, at the discretion of the Royal Trustees, any amount not requiredbeing added to the sums accruing to them for accumulation towards making goodCivil List deficits.35. All the figures proposed in paras, 32 to 34 above are liable to be outdated byfuture changes in prices and costs. Your Committee therefore propose that these should be subject to periodical increase by the same means as is proposed for theCivil List itself. That is, legislation should provide for these amounts to beincreased as necessary by Treasury Order laid before Parliament. A review forthis purpose should be held not less frequently than once in every 10 years, on thesame basis as is proposed for The Queen&apos;s Civil List.Minor Proposals36. Finally Your Committee wish to propose two minor changes concernedwith pensions. The first of these relates to the superannuation arrangements forstaff of the Royal Household. These are modelled as closely as possible on civilservice pension arrangements. Payments are, however, at present governed bySection 7(1) of the Civil List Act 1952 which does not enable the Treasury to make payments of&quot; transfer values &quot; in cases of Royal Household employees transferringto other public sector employment. This has caused difficulties and in some caseshardship. Your Committee recommend that this deficiency in the 1952 Act be remedied by an appropriate addition to Section 7(1).37. The second proposal relates to the Civil List pensions described in para. above. There are now 107 such pensions in payment and although these have tosome extent been increased in amount they have not kept pace with the fall in thevalue of money. The 1952 Act placed a limit of  5,000 on the amount of new and increased pensions which could be awarded each year (replacing the previous limit of  2,500 fixed in 1937). In order to enable provision for further increases to bemade in the rates of pension and to allow the award of further such pensions your committee recommend that this figure should now be increased to  10,000. they also consider that in order to allow for the possibility of future inflation it would be appropriate for this figure to be increased as necessary by Treasury Order.Conclusion38. Your Committee can now summarise their recommendations as follows: (a) The Civil List (for Her Majesty The Queen alone) should be fixed at theannual figure of  980.000 in respect of the Salaries and Expenses of theRoyal Household (formerly Classes I! and 111 and part of Class V), and royal bounty, alms and special services (formerly part of Class IV).
SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE CIVIL LIST(/;) Provision for other members of the Royal Family to be as indicated in paras. 32 to 34 above.(c) A sum of  60,000 to be made available to the Royal Trustees for makingcontributions towards expenses of the performance of duties pertaining tothe Royal Family by those of Their Royal Highnesses for whomParliament has not otherwise made provision (formerly part of Class V).(d) Sums made available under (a) and (c) above which are not required tomeet the expenditure incurred for those purposes in any calendar year tobe paid to the Royal Trustees, to be accumulated by them for making good deficiencies in the provision under (a) above in subsequent years.(e) Superannuation arrangements for staff of the Royal Household to be amended to include the payment or receipt of transfer values; provisionfor the award of Civil List pensions to be increased to  10.000 per annum.(/) Provision for any of the sums specifically charged on the consolidate fund as a result of these proposals to be increasahle by Treasury Order,to take effect from the 1st January following a report by the RoyalTrustees. Such reports, which would be laid before Parliament, to be made when necessary, and in any event not less frequently than once every10 years.(g) These new arrangements to take effect from 1st January, 1972.
