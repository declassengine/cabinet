DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government cp(71) 144 COPY NO     gg30 November 1971CABINETCONCORDEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for trade and industry. The Minister for Aerospace is meeting M. Chamant, theFrench Minister of Transport, on 7 December to discuss the questionof Concorde&apos;s selling price. Our attitude on this depends on whether we intend to continue with Concorde.2. The fundamental review of the project we had planned with theFrench Government cannot take place before next February.    The basicissues, however, are clear now.    There continues to be no economiccase for continuing with Concorde.    The French Government, however,are clearly determined to go ahead with it.    To pull out unilaterallywould do the most serious harm to our relations with the FrenchGovernment whose support is essential before the ratification of our european Economic Community (e.c.) membership and is likely to behardly less important after we become members of the Community.3. The employment and industrial consequences of cancellationwould also be severe.   Some 26, 000 jobs would be lost in 1972.    TheBritish Aircraft Corporation (BAG) would almost certainly have to dropout of the civil aircraft business and Rolls-Royce Bristol EngineDivision would be seriously affected.    The morale of the whole aerospaceindustry would be bound to suffer and our credibility as a collaborativepartner in the aerospace field and in defence technology generally wouldbe called into question.    The chances of any closer association with theEuropean aerospace industry would be jeopardised.    Cancellation would,I believe, also be a sharp blow to the morale of British industry generally and of the public.4. It is therefore no longer realistic in my view to contemplate with-drawing unilaterally from Concorde.    If my colleagues share this view,I believe it most important that from now on we should set our reservationsaside and give the project our full support.    In this way we are more likely to be able to influence key decisions and to obtain our fair share ofthe considerable publicity Concorde attracts.    We shall still have the review with the French Government in February since there will still bea number of important policy issues to discuss.1
5. We shall need to think carefully in this context about the timing ofa British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) order and the terms of thefinancial arrangements which are bound in one way or another to involve a heavy continuing subsidy.    I will submit detailed proposals on this as soonas possible.    We shall also need to take account of the fact that the poorfinancial position of other airlines is likely to limit the prospect ofsecuring further orders in the near future.6. The immediate issue is the line the Minister for Aerospace shouldtake on selling price at his meeting with M. Chamant.    Our attitude sofar has been that this should be a &quot;floor price&quot; calculated as that necessaryto cover all costs and charges,including some R&amp;D levy, on a productionprice of 100 aircraft below which the manufacturers should not go withoutthe approval of both Governments.    Similarly, we have argued that theGovernments shovld approve the other key contractual terms,eg   escalation, guarantees etc.    The French Government consider thatthe selling price and the other contractual terms should be settled by the manufacturers.    If we stick to our line at the meeting on 7 December itwill provoke a row with the French Government end we shall be accused of wishing to kill the project.7. Our stand on price has been conditioned by the need to avoid prejudicing our position in case we should have to withdraw from the project.    If my colleagues accept that withdrawal is no longer a practicalpossibility, then I believe we must adopt a more flexible approach.Officials&apos; assessment of the full price (based on 100 aircraft) at July 1971conditions is $36 million (approximately  15 million where   1 ^ $2. 40).No airline in my judgment will be prepared to pay this price.    This isalso the view of the Central Policy Review Staff and Cooper Brothers.8. The manufacturers have proposed that the selling price for initialorders (a maximum of 18) from BOAC, Air France and PAN AM (underthe terms of their option PAN AM must be given the same price as BOACand Air France) should be $31. 2 million ( 13 million) at July 1971conditions.    They would then seek the Governments approval for the price,which they confidently believe could be increased, for subsequent orders.There is however a significant risk that the price could not be increased in this way:Result if manufacturers can increase pricesLoss on production Levy Recovery100  25 m150 -  45 mResult if price cannot be increasedLoss on production Levy Recovery100  60 m150  20 m2
If only 50 aircraft were sold the losses would of course be greater thanthose indicated above.These losses would to some extent be offset by profits from the sale of spares but receipts from these would be spread over a long period so theeffect in discounted terms would not be markedly different.9.        Although there is this risk of loss in accepting the manufacturers&apos;initial pricing proposals, I do not believe we have any practical alternative,I propose therefore that the Minister for Aerospace should informM. Chamant that we approve the manufacturers&apos; proposal on price butseek his agreement that the Government should also approve the other keycontractual terms.    Mr. Chamant is unlikely to accept this and we mayhave to concede this point.    Colleagues will wish to consider whatnegotiating position the Minister for Aerospace should take on this pointin the event of deadlock.RE C OMM END A TION10.       I invite my colleagues:a. to agree that unilateral withdrawal is no longerpracticable and that we should henceforth give the projectour full backing;b. to agree that the Minister for Aerospace should takethe line on the selling price proposed in paragraph 9 above;c. to consider what negotiating position the Minister forAerospace should take on the other key contractual terms,in the event of deadlock with M. Chamant on 7 December.J d department of Trade and Industry30 November 19713
