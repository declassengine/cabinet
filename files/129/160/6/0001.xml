The Review Bodyrs recommendations are summarised inthe Annex.2. The two main principles underlying the report are that MembersTremuneration should now be assessed on the basis that membership of theHouse is a full-time commitment, and that, in general, Members shouldnot in future &quot;be expected to meet reasonable expenses out of their salary&quot;.The Review Body accordingly propose that, in addition to an increase inMembers1 salaries to  4,500, the range of Members1 allowances should be substantially widened to meet the expenses necessarily incurred, and to effect, as far as possible, a separation between a MemberTs salary and theprovision for his expenses.

In announcing the reference of Members&apos; pay to the Review Body on  December last I made it clear that the final decision on their recommendations would rest with the Government.    Nevertheless whenthe Government set up these Review Bodies It was the intention, as statedin paragraph 121 of the report, that their proposals should be implementedunless there were &quot;clear and compelling reasons to the contrary&quot;.Furthermore, the Review Body have strongly indicated their view thattheir proposals should be implemented as a whole and in full(paragraph 121).1
4. Against this background, and accepting the two. principles underlyingtheir recommendations, the Ministerial Group regard the report asbroadly acceptable and suggest that the Governments reservations mightbe confined to two relatively minor recommendations, i. e.i. The Review Body propose (paragraph 42b) that to meet the costs of Members&apos; travel within the United Kingdom and overseasto inform themselves on subjects of relevance to their work, twofunds should be established, to be administered by an all-Partycommittee of the House, and to which individual Members couldapply for assistance.    The selection of Members to receivepayments from the funds would give rise to problems and there arealso questions over the taxation treatment of the payments.    It issuggested that the Government might give qualified acceptance inprinciple to this recommendation, but Indicate that furtherconsideration would be required with the Parties in the House.ii. The Review Body also recommend (paragraph 41) thatprovincial Members should be eligible to draw a subsistence allowance, based on Civil Service rates, to meet the additional cost of staying away from their homes, when engaged on parliamentary duties.    This also raises problems ofadministration and personal taxation (e.g. would payment benecessarily related to the period of time spent away, and howwould this affect Members&apos; tax allowance claims in respect ofLondon accommodation?).    It seems essential for furtherconsideration to be given to the implementation of thisrecommendation by the House authorities in consultation v/ithofficials.MINISTERIAL SALARIES5. The Ministerial Group felt that it would reflect more accuratelythe workload of Government Whips in the Commons if their salaries were raised to that recommended for Government Whips in the Lords, namely 4,500.    It is not proposed, however, to increase the salary of  4,000recommended (for the first time) for two Opposition Whips in the Commons.These Whips are not denied outside earnings opportunities as areGovernment Whips.6, The proposed increase in certain Ministerial salaries is substantial(e.g. 64 per cent in the case of Cabinet Ministers if the increase in parliamentary salary to  3,000, which now has an element of remuneration in it, is included).    Colleagues may wish to consider thepossible presentational advantage of staging these particular increases.7. The attention of colleagues is also drawn to the footnote at page 2of the Annex.2CONFSDENTEAL
PENSIONS8.        The majority of the recommendations affecting the pensions ofMinisters, Members, and office holders will require legislation.    Thetechnical issues to be resolved are complex, and if this legislation wereto be included with that required to raise Ministerial salaries an additionaldelay of some months might be involved.    A separate Pensions Bill istherefore proposed.TIMING AND PRESENTATION9.        I have already stated in the House that it is hoped to publish thereport before Christmas.    In deciding on the date it will be necessary totake into account, amongst other things, the publication date of the reportof the Civil List Committee, which is expected to be 6 December.    I would propose that the Review Bodyrs report should be published on 2 december and that a Ministerial statement should be made on the same day.10.       I would further propose that the Resolutions on Members&apos; pay and allowances and for the increase in the Parliamentary salary of Ministersbe moved to take effect from 1 January 1972, that the legislation to effect the changes in Ministerial salaries should, if possible, complete itsCommons stages by Christmas, and that the new salaries for Ministers andother office holders should all take effect from 1 April 1972, whether or notlegislation is required in a particular case.    I understand that the PrimeMinister also wishes to include in the legislation a limited number of changes in the provisions affecting Ministerial appointments.11.        I would not propose at this stage that any specific commitmentregarding the timing of the legislation on pensions should be given.CONCLUSION12.       I seek the agreement of colleagues to the proposals set out above andto the prior consultation, as necessary, of the office holders concerned,including Mr Speaker,W w privy Council Office26 November 19713

REMUNERATION OF MEMBERS OF parliament and MINISTERSINTRODUCTION1. The remuneration of Members of Parliament and Ministers was lastreviewed in 1964, by a committee under the chairmanship of Sir GeoffreyLawrence.* As recommended by that committee, the salary of Memberswas increased from  1,750 to  3,250, by resolution of the House ofCommons with effect from 16 October, 1964. At the same time theParliamentary salary drawn by Ministers was increased from  750 to  1,250;but the Government of the day considered that it would not be appropriate,in the prevailing economic circumstances, to increase Ministerial salariesas such to the full extent recommended. The increases recommended for ministers were therefore halved and the new salaries were not given effect until 1 April, 1965.2. By 1969 the Government was again under pressure to take steps toincrease Members&apos; pay and, on 24 July, announced certain measures toimprove the facilities available to Members; later in the same year anannual secretarial allowance was introduced for the first time. TheGovernment explained that these improvements were intended to be of an interim nature and stated its intention to refer the whole question ofMembers&apos; salaries to the National Board for Prices and Incomes duringthe next Parliament. Subsequently, during the debate on a Bill to set upa Commission for Industry and Manpower, the Secretary of State for employment and Productivity announced that the Bill would provide for regular reviews of Members&apos; and Ministers&apos; pay by a special panel of theproposed Commission; but with the General Election of June 1970 this bill elapsed.3. Early in the life of the new Parliament there was sustained pressure from Members for a review. On 2 November, 1970, the Secretary of Statefor Employment announced the Governments decision to establish threeReview Bodies, one of which was to deal with top salaries in the publicservice; subsequently, on 4 December, 1970, it was announced that thequestion of Members&apos; and Ministers&apos; salaries would be referred to this review Body.4. We are required to review and recommend what changes are desirable in the emoluments, allowances and expenses of Ministers of theCrown and Members of the House of Commons, including Mr. Speaker andother holders of remunerated offices in both Houses of Parliament, andthe relevant pension arrangements. Our terms of reference are, therefore,slightly different from those of the Lawrence Committee in that they excludeany consideration of payments to Members of the House of Lords, other* Report of the Committee on the Remuneration of Ministers and Members of Parliament,Cmnd. 2516, November 1964.
than paid office-holders, by way of expenses allowance or otherwise. Likethe Lawrence Committee, we have included in our review the office of theLord Chancellor, as this involves substantial ministerial and official duties(the latter arising from the Lord Chancellors function as Speaker of theHouse of Lords), although the remuneration for this office is entirelyattributable to its judicial and official aspects, and in his ministerial capacitythe Lord Chancellor receives no salary at all. We have also interpreted the term &apos; remunerated offices &apos; to include the Leader of the Opposition andthe Chief Opposition Whip in both Houses.5.  Our principal methods of obtaining evidence have been as follows :(a) After preliminary consultation with an informal advisory groupdrawn from both main parties in the House of Commons, we sent a questionnaire to all Members requesting information on suchmatters as their expenses, hours of work and involvement in other occupations, together with their views on the various aspects of their remuneration; the results of our survey are given in Appendix A.(b) We invited written statements from Ministers and other office-holdersin both Houses, both under the present and previous administrations.(c) We interviewed a total of 43 Members from both Houses ofParliament, including several Ministers and ex-Ministers and someoffice-holders.(d) We received a number of memoranda submitted by Parliamentarygroups or by individual Members.6. We also obtained, with the help of the Foreign and commonwealth office, information on the remuneration of Ministers and Parliamentaryrepresentatives in certain other countries. The Inland Revenue providedus with information on the levels of expense incurred by Members inconnection with their Parliamentary duties. We held discussions with, and obtained other information from, members of the staff of the House ofCommons, the Civil Service Department, the Board of Inland Revenue, andthe Department of Health and Social Security. On the question of pensionswe obtained advice from a firm of pension consultants. We took steps, bycommissioning an attitude survey, to sample the opinions of the public ona number of relevant questions.7. We wish to convey our sincere thanks to all those who have takenso much trouble to help us.
PART IREMUNERATION OF MEMBERS OF THEHOUSE OF COMMONSCHAPTER 1THE PRESENT situation. The present structure of M P&apos;s remuneration is complicated andwe begin, therefore, with an explanation of its various components.Our public opinion survey showed that this is a matter on which there is widespread ignorance of the true position. Only a quarter of the publicinterviewed could state correctly the range ( 000) in which an MP&apos;s salaryactually falls, while a third thought that MPs were paid more than  4,000(see Appendix B); the actual figure is  3,250. Moreover, it is widelybelieved that MPs have better facilities than they in fact have, and theextent to which they must meet expenses out of their salary is by nomeans generally appreciated.2. To assist them in the performance of their Parliamentary duties,Members are provided with certain facilities; certain allowances are also provided to help in defraying some of the expenses which they necessarilyincur. Within the House of Commons itself, free stationery, postage and telephone facilities are provided for use on Parliamentary business. Inaddition free first-class rail, air and sea vouchers are available within theUnited Kingdom for travel between Westminster and the Member&apos;sconstituency, Westminster and home, and home and constituency. Inaddition, since April 1971, four free return vouchers per year have been available for the Member&apos;s wife (or husband) for travel betweenWestminster and the Member&apos;s constituency, and Westminster and home.Alternatively, a car mileage allowance, currently at the rate of 5p per mile,is payable. Since October 1969, Members have also been able to claimreimbursement of secretarial expenses of up to a maximum of  500 per year. Full details of facilities and allowances of Members of Parliamentare given in Appendix C.3. Beyond these, however, the MP must meet the expenses incurred in connection with his duties out of his own income; the only relief he can obtain is that, provided they meet the normal requirement under Schedule Eof being wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in connection with hiswork, these expenses are deductible from his Parliamentary salary beforeis is assessed for tax. The categories of expense which the Inland Revenuenormally recognises as tax-deductible are the following:(a) Additional cost of living away from home when engaged in parliamentary duties: provincial Members of Parliament, i.e. those whose constituencies are outside the London boroughs, can claim forthe additional cost of living either in London or in the constituency(but not both).
(c) Office expenses: any costs of office accommodation and secretarial assistance incurred over and above the secretarial allowance received.(d) Incidental expenses: such as the cost of hiring rooms to meetconstituents, the cost of circulars to inform constituents ofParliamentary activities, expenditure in connection with all-partyParliamentary organisations, and payments to a local agent or partyassociation in return for help in Parliamentary work; expenses incurred in connection with party political activities are not allowable.4. The expenses so allowed as a deduction for tax, but which the MPmust otherwise meet himself, amounted in 1969-70, on average for all members, to  1,330.* The net expenses incurred by provincial members were, however, nearly three times as high as those for London Members;and of provincial Members those most affected were Members representingrural as opposed to urban seats, whose larger constituencies often involvethem in considerable travelling expenses.5. The three major categories of tax-deductible expenses are;(i) additional accommodation costs (for provincial Members only), (ii) officeexpenses including secretarial assistance, and (iii) travelling expenses withinthe constituency. In 1969-70 for all Members the average additional costof living away from home was  685; the average office expenses, afterdeduction of the secretarial allowance, were  288; and the average travelling expenses within the constituency were  245. The average of other expensesclaimed was  112. Full details of expenses allowed for Members ofParliament are given in Appendix D.6. The extent, therefore, to which Members of Parliament payexpenses of their work out of their salary is much higher than is generally the case in other occupations; indeed most salaried employees expect all their reasonable expenses to be met in full by the employer and not merelytreated as deductible for tax. For this reason, amongst others, comparisonsbetween the M P&apos;s salary and other salaries can be quite misleading. taking into account the full secretarial allowance of  500, we estimate, on the basisof the latest figures available (for the tax year 1969-70) that the average net pay for the Member of Parliament, i.e. after meeting all necessaryexpenses but before tax, is a little under  2,000 per year; there will of course be considerable deviations from this average, both up and downwards. Weare clear from evidence we have received, both written and oral, that thereare individual MPs with considerable family responsibilities who are suffering financial hardship at the present time.7. Before considering the views which have been presented to us on members&apos; remuneration, and the issues involved, we take note in the nextchapter of some relevant features of the House of Commons, of the work ofMembers of Parliament and of the circumstances under which that work iscarried out.* The total expenses as shown in Appendix D less the average secretarial allowance forthe sessional year.
CHAPTER 2MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT AND THEIR WORK8. Members are drawn from a wide range of occupations. the occupational composition, at the time of entry, of the House of Commons hasbeen estimated as follows:Table AComposition of the two major parties in the House of Commons by occupation (a)	1951	1970	(per cent)	(per cent)Professions		Legal      .....................	18-2	19-6Medical   .....................	2-1	2-1Central and Local Government        .........	2-9	2-5Armed Forces    ..................	5-5	3-9Teaching.....................	7-6	10-other professions..................	1-8	7-8Business and others		Director   .....................	13-0	13-6Management and others.........      ......	10-6	7-3Manual workers............      ......	15-7	12-miscellaneous		Journalist/publisher      ...............	7-5	9-2Farmer    .....................	2-8	5-2Housewife...............      ......	0-5	0-other      ......	11-8	6-0Source: Condensed from the British General Election of 1951, by D. E. Butler, andThe British General Election of 1970, by D. E. Butler and M. Pinto-Duschinsky.(a) Based on the first or &apos; formative &apos; occupation.9. As this table shows, there has been a distinct growth over the last20 years or so in the number of Members drawn from professionalbackgrounds. The average age of Members entering Parliament in 1970was 40, only a year less than it was in 1951. Just over half of the members have been in Parliament for 10 years or less, while over a quarter havebeen Members for over 15 years. The average age of Members who retiredat the time of the last election was 57, and their average length of service was 17 years.10. Our survey (see Appendix A) has shown however that 70 per cent of Members other than office-holders pursue some other regular oroccasional occupation; though in many cases the amount of time spent onthe other occupation is quite small. Nearly 60 per cent of the Membersconcerned spend under 10 hours per week pursuing their other occupationswhile Parliament is sitting, and a further 29 per cent spend from 10 to 19hours per week.   Two-thirds of these Members earn over  1,000 per year
from their other occupations, over one-third more than  3,000, and one-fifthearn over  5,000, with the higher figures tending to be earned by members with constituencies in or near London. As is to be expected, members with other occupations spend less time both in attending the House andon other Parliamentary business. We found that involvement in an outsideoccupation was regarded by at least three out of four Members as beneficial to the work of Parliament by keeping Members in touch with other areasof life and providing expertise helpful to the work of Parliament. Only asmall number of those pursuing other occupations felt that it was a disadvantage which was forced on them by financial necessity. many members, however, have been at pains to point out to us that the job ofan M P is increasingly becoming full-time and that it becomes progressively more difficult to combine it satisfactorily with another regular occupation.il. There can be little doubt that the present century has seen a remarkable change in the role of Members of Parliament, both in terms ofwhat their constituents expect of them and in terms of the way in whichit is interpreted by Members themselves. The advent of modern mediaof communications, particularly television, has sharpened the politicalawareness of the public, both in domestic matters and foreign affairs, andthe electorate has become increasingly articulate with the spread of secondary and higher education. The electorate expects a much greaterdegree of application and professionalism from Parliamentarians than ever before. The increased intervention of the Government in the life of individuals has tended to make constituents more demanding, and a recentstudy has suggested that the average Member may now spend up to two hours per day answering correspondence from them and holds a &apos; surgery&apos;in his constituency at least once a fortnight.412. It is clear from our interviews that a growing number of members are not content simply to &apos; travel noisily &apos; and to leave the business ofGovernment entirely to the front benches. Politics and government arenot the same, but most MPs are no longer prepared to accept too sharpa distinction between them.f They wish and feel that they ought toparticipate more fully in the process of policy-making and in influencingwhat the Government actually does. They ask more questions, they makegreater demands for information and they are more active on Standing andSelect Committees, which have increased in number, and the work of whichhas become more detailed and exacting.13. We asked Members to estimate the hours which they spent perweek in the House during the last session (excluding time spent on privatework) and the hours they spent on Parliamentary business outside the House(excluding time spent travelling to and from their constituencies). Theiranswers are collated in the following table:* Anthony Barker and Michael Rush. The Member of Parliament and Information,Allen and Unwin, 1970.t We are deliberately drawing a contrast with an older view of the M P&apos;s functions strikinglyexpressed by Henry Fairlie in his book,&apos; The Life of Politics &apos;, Methuen, 1968; see especiallypages 198 to 207 on &apos; The Life of the House of Commons &apos;.

Source: OME Survey.The average total of 63 hours reported as spent by Members on their parliamentary work is much higher than the hours worked in most other occupations, but these figures are probably inflated to some extent by theheavy pressures arising in the last session from the passage of the industrial relations Bill. As might be expected, there is a fairly wide variation of hours reported, but 94 per cent of all Members said that they spent morethan 40 hours per week on their Parliamentary work. It is of interest to note that the hours reported to be spent on constituency work are noshorter for Ministers than for Members generally.14. The activities of Members of Parliament outside the House haveincreased, and inside the House also there has been a trend towardsheavier and longer work, both on the floor and in committee, as the followingtable indicates:Table CWorkload of Parliament	Total number of hours of sitting		Total number of attendances at sittings of		per session		Select Committees	Standing CommitteesAnnual averages 1899-1909  ...... 1919-29     ...... 1929-39     ...... 1949-59   ....... 1959-64     ......	1,222 1,116 1,245 1,268 1,334	Yearly total 1936-37 1951-52 1961-62	1,377 2,223 2,202	3,352 2,594 4,317Yearly total 1964-65     ...... 1965-66     ...... 1966-67 1967-68     ...... 1968-69     ...... 1969-70     ...... 1970-71      ......	1,551 1,353 1,642 1,591 1,548 1,166 1,523	1965-661 1966-67/	2,681 3,110 3,507 4,283 3,352 4,007	5,243 5,319 7,743 5,129 5,278 5,705				Source: House of Commons Records.
After a busy year in 1964-65, and a drop in 1965-66, the workload as measured by hours of sitting per session, moved up to a new peak in 1966-67;the drop in 1969-70 is of course explained by the much shorter sessionending with the election in 1970. At the same time the number of Membersattending meetings of Select and Standing Committees has risen steadilyduring the last 10 years; and indeed in the longer-term perspective thechange has been very marked. These are admittedly only crude measuresof the workload, but they give some indication of the increasing pressure of Parliamentary business.15. We now turn briefly to some of the circumstances under whichthis increasing workload is carried out. Although our terms of referencedo not include facilities (in the sense of physical facilities), we have thoughtit relevant to take some account of them as part of the general context inwhich the question of remuneration must be considered. Office accommoda-tion is extremely limited, with less than 150 single rooms available within theprecincts of the Palace of Westminster, and desk accommodation for83 Members&apos; secretaries. Although there are other places available forwriting both inside and outside the precincts, many Members are sharingcramped quarters with each other, and most have to work at a considerable distance from their secretaries. But this state of affairs will, it is hoped,be remedied when the new Parliamentary building is eventually constructedin Bridge Street.16. We found that 97 per cent of Members employ a secretary or share in the employment of a secretary, generally for between 10 hours and40 hours a week, with a median of 23 hours. The secretaries of provincialMembers usually work in London, at or near Westminster, but those ofLondon Members often work in the Member&apos;s constituency. Because offinancial circumstances, Members frequently pay their secretaries salariesless than those paid to secretaries in other forms of employment, althoughgood staff are often attracted by the interest of the job. The inability ofMembers to guarantee continuity of employment generally means that theirsecretaries are not covered by a superannuation scheme. A privateorganisation, Ashworth and Company, provides secretarial service on an agency basis within the precincts of the House, but accommodation limits the number of staff which can be employed, and it is used only by one in eight Members.17. Allied to the problem of secretarial assistance is that of researchassistance. At present the Library of the House of Commons provides a service which might better be described as an information service for members. This service, which was started in 1946 with two graduatelibrarians, has now been expanded to a total staff of over 50 librarians andclerks, including 12 graduates. Further expansion is envisaged when thenew Parliamentary building is constructed. The service at present providedis highly regarded, but many Members of Parliament feel a need for some-thing more than this limited service, and we found in our survey that about one Member in ten employs or shares in the employment of a researchassistant. As the expense of such an assistant is not at present recognised by the Inland Revenue as deductible from income before tax, it is not surprising that the majority are employed by Members with outside earnings of more than  1,000 per year.
18. Members are normally obliged to do a great deal of travelling.During the Parliamentary sessions, usually extending over about 34 weeksa year, the typical pattern of a provincial Member&apos;s life is to spend from monday to Thursday in London and the weekend in his constituency, eithertravelling by day on Friday or Monday, or else overnight on Thursday andSunday. * Many rural Members also travel extensively within their constituencies, the expenses of which they must pay themselves but whichare deductible for tax. In addition 10 per cent of Members have reported. that they incur other travelling expenses in respect of visits to gaininformation, outside their constituencies and sometimes overseas, which are neither recoverable nor deductible for tax.19. With two places of work Westminster and their constituency Members face special problems of living accommodation. We found thatalmost nine out of ten provincial Members maintain accommodation inLondon. Three out of four do not treat London as their place of residencebut have their main home elsewhere, in or outside their constituency inequal proportion, and claim tax relief for the higher additional cost ofliving in London. The type of accommodation varies widely, from thehumble bed-sitting room in a London surburb to a town house inWesminster. Others use residential hotels and clubs. At times of yearwhen accommodation is especially short it is not unknown for a member to have to move from week to week.20.  These then are some of the factors in the Member of Parliamentst situation to which we must have regard in considering his remuneration.Wc now consider the principal issues facing us in deciding what level of salary we should recommend, taking into account the views put to us byMembers themselves, together with other evidence which we have collected.* The total cost of providing free travel between Westminster, home and constituency in1969-70 was  206,000, equivalent to  327 per Member.
CHAPTER 3THE ISSUES21. In the eyes of the general public, MPs appear to be free to decidewithout restraint the level of their remuneration, and when increases takeplace they are invariably the subject of strongly felt criticism. In practice,it is the Government of the day which determines the remuneration ofMembers, as well as that of Ministers, and it is naturally sensitive topopular opinion on the subject, particularly in periods of inflation when itmay be urging restraint of incomes on the electorate. In these periods thepoliticians are generally among those who are considered to be leastdeserving of an increase in pay.  As a Member said in a debate last year:&quot; We do not like discussing our own problems and difficultiesbecause we know we are here to take care of the problems andgrievances and to look after the living standards of our constituents. . . .There is never a best time, only the least objectionable time for considering the matter.&quot;*22. The result has been that remuneration has been reviewed atrelatively infrequent intervals, about every 7 to 10 years, giving rise in the inflationary periods immediately after the first world war and since thesecond world war to considerable fluctuation in the real levels of payment.Compared in real terms, as distinct from monetary values, M Ps receivedconsiderably less remuneration during the greater part of the inter-war yearsand for a time after the second world war than they received before thefirst world war when payment for their services was first introduced, andit was not until 1964 that their level of reward was substantially increased.As a measure of the standard of living which their salary has representedduring this time (while not implying that the pay of M Ps should be fixed in relation to that of a given grade of civil servant), it is interesting to note that the equivalently paid official (in approximate terms) in the CivilService was, before the first world war, a Principal, f between the wars aHigher Executive Officer (two grades below a Principal), after the second world war a Senior Executive Officer (one grade below a Principal), and in1964 a Principal again. The nearest equivalent grade now is a SeniorExecutive Officer. These comparisons are even less favourable to the MPif account is taken of the fact that the civil servant, within standard limits,is reimbursed for all expenses incurred in performance of his duties.23. Since the MP&apos;s salary was raised to its present figures of  3,250in October 1964 prices have risen by nearly 45 per cent, so that the real value of the salary has dropped to approximately  2,260. Expressing theeffects of inflation in another way, a salary of equivalent value to that inOctober 1964 allowing for the intervening rise in prices, would now beabout  4,675.  If it were to be adjusted for the intervening rise in salaries* Hansard, Vol. 801, columns 1715, 1716.t One grade below an Assistant Secretary.
and average earnings, the equivalent would be approximately  5,400.* Wequote these figures because they give some indication of the effects ofsubmitting the MP&apos;s salary to review so infrequently, and not because webelieve that it should be adjusted automatically in relation to cost-of-livingor wage and salary indices. This would in our view be doubly wrong;first, because MPs should not be treated differently from the general public by being given an automatic safeguard against the effects of inflation;secondly, by itself this would exclude any re-evaluation of the job in the lightof new circumstances.24. When a salary for MPs was first proposed in 1911, the argumentswere largely concerned with the nature of the membership of the House ofCommons. On the one side it was argued that without payment certainkinds of people would be excluded or that without adequate payment such people could only be Members by suffering undue financial hardship; onthe other side it was said that payment would attract the wrong kind of people or that too large a payment would have the undesirable effect of producing a House exclusively composed of full-time professional Members.While the principle of remunerating the Member of Parliament is no longerseriously disputed, the question whether his job should be treated as full-time or part-time in determining the level of pay continues to be a matterof debate. The Lawrence Committee noted that this question had neverreceived an authoritative answer in the various recommendations whichhad been made from time to time on the Member&apos;s salary, and it foundMembers&apos; replies to the question to be inconclusive. The Committee itselfpreferred not to express any opinion on this, but took into account, first,that the House of Commons contained, and was likely to continue to contain a number of Members who did not have the opportunity of supplementingtheir Parliamentary salary by earnings outside the House; and secondly, thatthe possibility of making such earnings varied greatly from Member to member.25. We ourselves found that, while some three-quarters of Membersconsidered that the existing degree of involvement in other occupations wasbeneficial to the work of the House, most Members felt strongly that the salary should be assessed on a full-time basis. Greater opportunity to carryon a second job exists for Members engaged in some occupations, such asthe law and journalism, than in others, and for London Members than for provincial Members. Moreover, while only one out of eight Members hasa part-time occupation which employs him for more than 20 hours a week,less than half this proportion, or only one out of sixteen Members, spendsless than 40 hours per week on Parliamentary work, while the average forall Members shown in our survey is 63 hours. We have already drawn attention in the previous chapter to the increasing demands placed onMPs both in Parliament and in their constituencies. By any reasonable standard, therefore, most Members must be considered as working on afull-time basis, and we consider that the level of remuneration should be assessed accordingly.f   Any attempt to differentiate between the pay of* Increases to August 1971.t Another important and interesting point is whether the job generally represents a&apos; life-time&apos; or &apos; an in-and-out&apos; career. The evidence we have on this point is not,however, conclusive.9125792 b
Members on the basis of involvement in other occupations, earnings fromother sources or amount of Parliamentary work undertaken (e.g. incommittees), would in our view be neither practicable nor desirable.*26. A view which has been not infrequently put to us in evidence isthat the status and privileges of public service are themselves a rewardwhich justify taking into account some &apos; element of self-sacrifice&apos; insetting the salary level. We do not attach too much weight to this argument.Status and privilege are in part determined by the salary level, andM Ps have suffered relatively in this respect. Further, it is at least open to question how far this assumed element of self-sacrifice contributes to theproper functioning of the democratic process; electors may feel freer to judge on the merits of performance if Members and Ministers are known tobe getting a &apos; proper rate for the job&apos;.27. The difficulty of assessing a fair level of pay is compounded by theway in which the notion of the Member&apos;s payment has developed. It hascome to be regarded as being composed of two parts, one being in the natureof a salary from which Members have to meet their living expenses, andthe other being intended to meet the expenses of carrying out their parliamentary duties. But these expenses have varied not only accordingto the nature of the Member&apos;s constituency, whether it is rural or urban and its distance from London, but also according to the way in which an individual Member sees his role and deals with his work.28. In the year 1969-70, the expenses of MPs varied from less than 300 to more than  3,000. The effect upon total pay is that the more expensea Member incurs in carrying out his job (however reasonably) the less arehis disposable earnings; this may mean also that the more work he doesin visiting his constituency and dealing with his constituents&apos; problems, theless money is left in his pocket.29. It is true that Members have been provided increasingly with freefacilities, for example travel and postage, and more recently with allowances,such as the secretarial allowance, so that the value of these facilities is nowquite substantial, averaging about  1,000 or nearly one-third of the nominalsalary. But the weight of expenses which must still be met from the salaryis heavier than in 1964 despite these allowances, and apart from the questionof increasing existing allowances, about four out of every five Members whoresponded to our questionnaire thought that there were other categories ofexpense which should be covered by allowances in cash or in kind. some new Members have expressed surprise at the high level of expense whichthey have found it necessary to incur out of their salary.30. One of the most basic questions we have to consider, therefore, is whether an M P&apos;s salary should be determined independently of his expenses.In other words, should the level of salary be determined on the basis that, in* On the other hand some of us are inclined to feel that the time is approaching, and mayalready have arrived, when the House of Commons ought to consider the award of a strictly limited number of honoraria to the Chairmen of certain designated Select, and possiblyStanding Committees. We have been impressed with evidence put before us that theChairmanship of such committees involves the responsibility for a considerable volume of detailed preparatory work if these Committees are effectively to perform their propersessional function.
general, reasonable expenses will be covered by allowances in cash or in kind and that the Member will not be expected to meet these out of his salary,provided they are within the allowed limits? There is no doubt that thepresent system of payment, whereby some expenses are met in cash or kind,while others are allowed, if at all, only as deductions from income before tax?falls unevenly in its effects on Members and gives rise to misconceptions inthe public mind as to the level at which Members of Parliament are paid.31. Our public opinion survey indicated that a substantial proportionof the public does not feel that the pay of MPs should be increased (seeAppendix B). The public attitude must be seen, however, against a background of widespread ignorance not only as to the actual level of salary, to which we referred earlier, but as to the time spent by MPs ontheir work (considerably underestimated), and the extent to which they havehad to meet expenses out of their own pocket. When people were informed of the actual details of remuneration and expenses, there was a significantshift in opinion, as shown below:Table DAttitude to pay before and after being informed of actualremuneration of Members of Parliament	Before	After	(per cent)	(per cent)Overpaid.........	36	15Adequate.........	38	50Underpaid        ......	14	33Don&apos;t know       ......	12	2Source; OME Survey.32. The treatment of Member&apos;s expenses does not compare favourably with the practice in many foreign and Commonwealth countries which weexamined (see Appendix E). In some cases subsistence or attendanceallowances are paid to cover living expenses incurred in attendingParliamentary sessions in the capital, and general expenses allowances tocover other costs, particularly those in the constituency. While a secretarialallowance is paid in only one of the countries covered, in many countrieseach Member is provided with a secretary or service is available from atyping pool. In some instances, a proportion of between 40 and 45 percent of the salary is tax-free in order to provide for expenses, and in twocountries the salary is completely tax-free. The level of salary varies widelybetween the countries in our sample, the highest being  8,400 (Italy) andthe lowest  2,500 (Irish Republic). If those countries in which the salariesare wholly tax-free are excluded, and the tax-free elements for expensesare deducted where appropriate, then the net pay before tax in the remainingcountries falls into a band between  1,500 and  7,400, the average being 4,200, as compared with the British Member of Parliaments average net11125792 B 2
pay before tax of a little under  2,000.* These comparisons help to throwsome light on the inadequacy of the expense arrangements applying to M Psin this country.33. We ourselves take the view that in general Members should not beexpected to meet reasonable expenses out of their salary, and thatcorrespondingly the level of salary should be set independently of the costs of meeting expenses. We recognise that this principle is not capable ofperfect application; it would hardly be practicable to devise arrangements under which Members did not have to dip into their salaries to meet certainexpenses, however reasonable they might be. But as a general rule webelieve that, in future, a clear separation should be observed between salary,on the one hand, and provision for expenses on the other; we take this,therefore, as a basic premise in approaching the question of the appropriatesalary level. It should not normally be the responsibility of the individual member to finance the facilities he needs to do his job.34. In seeking appropriate criteria by which to determine a fair salaryfor Members of Parliament it is relevant to consider also the extent towhich two of the classic approaches to wage and salary determination supply and demand and comparability can reasonably be applied. Clearlyno case can be made for increasing their pay on supply and demand groundsif the matter is looked at simply in a quantitative sense, since there is noshortage of would-be candidates. In our view a far more relevantconsideration is that the salary should be sufficient not to deter people ofability and energy, particularly those with family responsibilities, whowould not be able to call on other sources of income, and to ensure the adequate representation in the House of a wide range of social, occupationaland industrial groups. Supply and demand also needs to be interpreted in a long term sense: it is the gradual erosion or building-up of an occupation^ position in the pay structure which matters most, rather thantemporary fluctuations, and if pay levels are allowed to fall away, thereis a risk that in the long term at any rate the quality of new entrants willbe adversely affected.35. The Member&apos;s job is generally, and we think rightly, regarded asunique. Comparison is also complicated by the fact that Members are drawn from a wide variety of occupational backgrounds and, for many ofthem, membership of the House of Commons cannot be regarded as alife-time career. Some attempts have been made to draw comparisons withthe Civil Service, in particular with the grade of Assistant Secretary. Inour view no arguments of any substance have been produced on grounds of comparison as such. The heavy weight of support given by members to linking their pay to that of the Civil Service stems mainly from a desire to remove the question of salary determination from the politicalarena and to provide protection against the erosion of their salaries throughinflation. We do not feel that Members should have the benefit of any suchbuilt-in mechanism by which their salaries would be automatically adjusted.The question of remuneration should be examined periodically (and wewould hope regularly) on its merits and in the light of the relevantcircumstances at the time.   It would in our view be quite wrong that* It must be recognised that these comparisons are, for various reasons, subject to aconsiderable margin of error, particularly in view of differences in the cost of living.
negotiations on the pay of Civil Servants should have to take place in theknowledge that the outcome would also govern the pay of Members ofParliament. The question of future reviews of Members&apos; salary is to whichwe shall return later in this report.36. The determination of an appropriate level of remuneration for members of Parliament must in the end be a matter of judgment based onall the factors we have discussed in this and earlier chapters: there is noformula which can be automatically applied to determine the appropriatelevel of remuneration for MPs. We are dealing with a situation whichhas not been basically examined for seven years, and something more isrequired than an updating exercise. We believe that the MP&apos;s job nowcalls for some degree of revaluation, both in terms of the growing volumeof work, and the changing nature of that work, which we have described in Chapter 2. One effect of these changes is that the job of an MP hasbecome increasingly full-time, and in our view it is essential that the levelof remuneration should be adequate to provide for full-time Memberswithout other sources of income. We consider that the minimum figure towhich the salary of Members should forthwith be raised is  4,500. In thefollowing chapters we present our proposals for increased allowances and facilities, and for improved pension arrangements for Members of Parliament;but for these proposals, particularly those relating to subsistence, secretarialand constituency travelling expenses, we should have recommended a considerably higher salary.37. Recommendation: We recommend that the salary of Members ofParliament should be increased to  4,500 a year.
ALLOWANCES AND FACILITIES38. We have explained in the previous chapter our view that there isa need to increase the proportion of Members&apos; expenses which are providedfor or are reimbursed in cash or kind. As outlined in Chapter 1, the categories of expense which are at present not so treated fall within fourbroad groups, and we now examine each of these in turn.Additional cost of living away from home when engaged on Parliamentaryduties39. The additional costs of living away from home, particularly for provincial Members who are not resident in London, are the largest item of expense incurred by most MPs. As indicated in Chapter 1, this expense,which arises from the fact that Members have two places of business,Westminster and their constituency, is currently allowed as a deduction from income before tax. The net effect under existing rates of taxation is,on average, to provide relief from tax to the extent of about 30 per cent ofthe expense incurred. It is clear from the evidence we have received that many Members find the costs of additional accommodation, especially inLondon, a considerable burden, and we are of the opinion that members should not be expected to meet them entirely out of their salary.40. We therefore attach at Appendix F our proposals for the paymentof a subsistence allowance to provincial Members, and for a Londonsupplemental payment to Members who live in the capital. This schemeis based on the practice currently in operation for members of the public services who are sent away from their main place of work. Briefly, an allowance based on a fixed daily scale would be paid to cover the reasonableadditional cost to provincial Members of staying either in London ( 5*25per day) or their constituency ( 5 per day),* when engaged on parliamentary duties. Provincial Members would be regarded as living and workingeither in London or their constituency according to their choice, and would receive the subsistence allowance for the additional cost incurred in attendingat their other place of work. Provincial Members would also receive thesubsistence allowance for overnight absence from their normal constituencybase when carrying out Parliamentary duties within their constituency. the allowance would be paid at the same time as the Member&apos;s salary againsta certificate that the amount had actually and necessarily been expended.This allowance would not be subject to tax; however Members would not normally be able to claim a deduction from their income before tax forany excess subsistence expenses incurred above the scale. LondonMembers, and those provincial Members who opt to be regarded as resident in London, would receive a London supplement of  175 per year as an* Currently the scales applying to officers in grades with a national salary minimum notless than that of Assistant Secretary.
addition to their salary for the extra cost of living in London comparedwith other parts of the country; this addition to their salary would besubject to tax.41. Recommendation: We recommend that a scheme should beintroduced for the payment of a subsistence allowance and LondonSupplement. We further recommend that provision should be made forthe scale of these payments to be adjusted in line with adjustments made from time to time in the appropriate Civil Service scales.Travelling expenses42. With regard to travelling expenses and the provision of freetravelling facilities, there are three areas in which we consider that changes should be made:(a) Within the constituencyThe travelling expenses incurred by Members in the performance oftheir Parliamentary duties within their constituencies are another largeitem of expenditure, particularly for those representing ruralconstituencies, which are currently only allowed as a deduction from income before tax. The expenses incurred tend to vary considerably asbetween Members for London and urban constituencies, withcomparatively small distances to travel, and Members for ruralconstituencies, who must often cover very large areas. Members forsome rural constituencies stated that their mileage in the constituencycould be, in an extreme case, as high as 30,000 miles a year. Weconsider that these travelling expenses should be reimbursed on asimilar basis to those for journeys between Westminster and the constituency.Members of Parliament, in the course of performing their Parlia-mentary duties, also frequently require to visit central and localGovernment offices dealing with their constituency areas. Sometimesthese offices are outside the constituency boundaries, as for example inthe case of many London constituencies. We think the expenses ofsuch journeys should be reimbursed in the same way as the expensesof journeys within the constituency.Recommendation: We recommend that the travelling expenses ofjourneys made by Members of Parliament in the performance of their parliamentary duties within their constituencies, and to central and localGovernment authorities which are concerned with their constituencyareas but are located outside their constituency boundaries, should be reimbursed on a basis similar to that now applying to journeys betweenWestminster and their constituencies.ib) Travel within the United Kingdom and overseasAn increasing number of Members incur expenses in travellingoutside their constituencies, both within the United Kingdom and overseas, to inform themselves on subjects of relevance to their work.These are generally not even deductible for tax. We consider that suchtravel should be encouraged where it can be shown to be of assistance
to Members in carrying out their duties effectively. We have in mind,for example, visits in connection with the sponsoring of a private Bill,to extend a Member&apos;s knowledge of an industry which is of special importance in his constituency, and, in the case of Opposition spokesmen,to examine matters of national interest in the sphere for which theyare responsible.Recommendation: We recommend the establishment of two funds to meet the costs of travel within the United Kingdom and overseasrespectively, which might be administered by an all-party committee ofthe House of Commons, and to which individual Members could apply for assistance. The funds should be supported by annual subscriptionsfrom the Exchequer, which we suggest should amount in the first instance to  10,000 and  20,000 respectively.(c) Free travelling facilities for Members&apos; wives or husbandsBy the nature of their work most Members have to spend a greatdeal of time away from home. Where Members use their cars fortravelling between Westminster and their constituency or home, their wives are able to accompany them at no extra expense, while in thecase of those Members whose constituencies are at some distance from london, and who in consequence use air, rail or sea transport, the numberof journeys where their wives can accompany them at no extra expenseis limited to four, for which vouchers are provided. We think that these facilities should now be extended.Recommendation : We recommend that free travelling facilities by air, rail or sea public transport should be provided for wives andhusbands of Members for up to 10 return journeys a year in totalbetween Westminster and the Member&apos;s constituency, or Westminsterand home.Secretarial expenses43. Nearly all M Ps employ or share in the employment of a secretary.The great majority consider the secretarial allowance of  500 a year to be inadequate in present circumstances. Secretarial and office costs, in excessof the secretarial allowance, represent another significant item of expensewhich is deductible from income before tax. Although there were a fewMembers, some with a very small postbag, who indicated that they couldmanage without a secretary or with only a small amount of part-timeassistance, most stated that they needed full-time secretarial assistance andthat this affected considerably the amount of time which they could give to non-administrative duties. The amount of assistance required depended onthe amount of correspondence received, which varied considerably accordingto the nature of the Member&apos;s constituency. Some Members reportedreceiving as many as 150 letters a week, many of which required a great dealof attention. Members also pointed out that they had to pay for officeequipment for their secretary out of their salary, since the present allowancecould only be used for the direct cost of employing a secretary. although some limited office accommodation and equipment is available in the House,Members have to provide all their own facilities in their constituencies. The
pay of secretaries has risen substantially since the secretarial allowance was first introduced in 1969, and we consider that it should now be increased,taking some account also of the expenses of providing office accommodation,stationery and equipment.44. Many Members of Parliament also employ or share in theemployment of a research assistant. The nature of their work is principallyinformative and is used to supplement the service available from the libraryof the House of Commons. In our view it is fundamental to the properfunctioning of Parliament that Members should have adequate means of informing themselves. We mentioned in paragraph 42 above, with regardto travel outside a Member&apos;s constituency, some examples of the areas inwhich Members may need to seek information in order to perform their parliamentary duties effectively. Other areas include the investigation ofconstituents&apos; complaints, preparatory work in connection with membership of a Select or Standing Committee, and the gathering of background materialrelating to legislation before Parliament or matters under debate. We are aware that the Inland Revenue, in exercising their normal functions, mustdistinguish between research assistance which is necessary to the efficientperformance of a Member&apos;s duties, and the expense of which might thus be allowed as a deduction before tax, and that which simply enables aMember to do his job better but would not be so allowable; in our view the types of research assistance which we have mentioned should be treated inthe former category. Moreover, bearing in mind that the library service ofthe House of Commons is now fully extended and cannot be expanded toprovide additional research assistance until the new Parliamentary building is constructed, as well as the limited extent to which secretarial help canbe put to this purpose, we are satisfied that there is a case for allowingMembers to offset the cost of employing a research assistant on workundertaken in the proper performance of a Member&apos;s duties against part ofthe secretarial allowance.45. Recommendation: We recommend that the secretarial allowance should be increased to  1,000 a year, to meet both secretarial and generaloffice expenses, of which up to  300 should be permitted to be used to meetcosts incurred in employing a research assistant on work undertaken in theproper performance of a Member&apos;s Parliamentary duties.Other expenses46. Other expenses fall into two broad categories. First, there are some other items which are allowed by the Inland Revenue as a deduction from income before tax. Secondly, there are those which, although theymay be considered reasonable by Members themselves, are not at presentaccepted by the Inland Revenue as being wholly, exclusively and necessarilyincurred in the performance of their Parliamentary duties.47. The former include such items as the cost of advertising and hiringrooms to meet constituents, while the latter include entertainment costs,subscriptions to associations, purchase of books and periodicals, and cost of taxis after late-night sittings. It is difficult to find commonyardsticks for the reimbursement of such expenses, which depend upon
so many variables related to the circumstances of individual Members.We do not, therefore, make any specific recommendations on these items ofexpense, but we estimate that, if our recommendations are accepted, these items will, on average, be reduced to little more than  300.Severance arrangements48. Some 80 per cent of Members answering the questionnaire feltthat some form of short-term assistance should be provided for members who lose their seats. At present, apart from the payment of a pension to Members who retire after the age of 65, no provision is made to alleviate the financial effects to Members of losing their seats or retiring at a generalelection. General elections occur with little notice: when they do, members have little time or opportunity to make any arrangements for alternative employment, particularly when they are pre-occupied with conducting a campaign for their re-election. Because their Parliamentary salary ceasesas from the date of dissolution, Members not retiring on a pension maysuddenly find themselves without any regular source of income, and even where they have another occupation which they can readily turn to, it maybe some time before the flow of income is resumed (e.g. in the case of teachers). The Member in this position is entitled neither to unemploymentbenefit, as he is classed as &apos; self-employed&apos; for the purposes of theNational Insurance Act, nor to any payment under the redundancy payments Act.49. In view of the uncertainties attached to the tenure of a Parliamentaryseat, which may arise from boundary changes as well as shifts in electoralfavour, and at the same time, the widely different circumstances of members in regard to opportunities to obtain alternative earnings, we feel that aseverance payment should be available to all Members who lose theirseat at a general election. We propose that this should take the form of aterminal grant equivalent to three months&apos; salary payable immediately afterpolling day to those Members who wish to claim it. We also feel that members should continue to be paid throughout the period of dissolution,even though for constitutional reasons they cease to be Members as soon asa dissolution takes place. * Any additional help needed in cases of specialhardship would be a matter for the Members&apos; Fund.50. We also consider that the position of Members under the national insurance Act should be re-examined. We recognise that, given the presentlimited structure of classes of insured persons under the Act, there might be difficulties in attempting to transfer Members to the &apos;employed&apos; class.The opportunity for a solution may, however, lie in the re-structuring ofthe National Insurance Scheme, which will be required under the new government pension policy, t This is intended to take into account thesituations of groups, like Members of Parliament, who are self-employed for national insurance purposes but who are assessed for income tax under shedule E (covering incomes from offices and employment). For Members* We express this view without prejudice to the important constitutional point thatGovernment Departments should give equal attention to matters raised with them bycandidates, whether or not they were Members of the last Parliament.t Strategy for pensions, Cmnd. 4755, September 1971.
of Parliament we suggest that provision might be made for the payment ofthe necessary &apos; employers contributions&apos; from the Exchequer via the Houseof Commons Vote (following the precedent established in regard to theMembers&apos; pension scheme).51. It is interesting to note that in our public attitude survey two-thirds of those interviewed thought that MPs should be able to claim unemploy-ment benefit and terminal payments.52. Recommendation: We recommend that Members of parliament should continue to be paid throughout the period of a dissolution and, in theevent of losing their seat following a general election, should be entitledto claim a terminal grant equivalent to three months&apos; salary. We furtherrecommend that the status of Members of Parliament under the national insurance arrangements should in due course be reviewed with a view toenabling them to draw unemployment benefit when appropriate.
oMEMBERS&apos; PENSIONSGeneral53. The Members&apos; pension scheme, which was introduced in 1965following the recommendation of the Lawrence Committee, is a compulsoryscheme based on a fund managed by trustees, who are appointed by theHouse of Commons, and into which equal cash contributions in respect of current service are made by Members and the Exchequer. The pension benefits accrue at one rate for the first 15 years of service and at a lower rate for a further 30 years, providing at current rates a pension of 60 percent of present salary after 45 years&apos; service. The qualifying age is 65.There are also other benefits, including pensions for widows and dependent children, and arrangements for contributions to be refunded or pension rights to be transferred in certain circumstances. Members who retiredbefore October 1964 are not covered by the scheme, but those who were still serving at that time and had prior service were accorded back-servicecredit up to a maximum of 10 years; this is funded by a deficiencycontribution paid by the Exchequer.54. The Members&apos; Fund, which was established in 1939, is likewisebased on compulsory contributions by Members and a further contribution by the Exchequer, and is managed by the same trustees as the Members&apos;Contributory Pension Fund. Grants are made at the discretion of the trustees to help reduce hardship experienced by ex-Members who are over60 years old or suffering from ill health, and their widows and children.Since the introduction of the Members&apos; pension scheme the need for suchgrants has been reduced, and it is anticipated that demands on the fund,and therefore the need to continue contributions, will eventually disappear.Fuller details of the Members&apos; pension scheme and Members&apos; Fund are givenin Appendix G.55. We have received a great deal of evidence on the subject of theMembers&apos; pension scheme and many suggestions for changes. Theparticular difficulties of devising a satisfactory scheme for MPs arise fromthe fact that their service is liable to be intermittent to a degree which israrely experienced in other occupations. The present scheme is somewhatunusual in that both benefits and contributions are fixed in money terms,which require frequent review to prevent the erosion of their value in times of rapidly rising prices and need to be adjusted whenever pay is increased.Recently the Government has announced that its policy is to enable everyindividual to have the opportunity to save for a pension related to hisearnings throughout his working life, and to ensure that a change of jobdoes not lead to the loss of occupational pension rights.* In the light ofthese factors we now review the various aspects of the present Members&apos;pension scheme, and consider what changes may be desirable.* Strategy for pensions, Cmnd. 4755, September 1971.
Qualifying period56. Since the life of a normal full Parliament is generally just overfour years, the present qualifying period for MPs of 10 years usuallyrequires service in at least three Parliaments, which in practice could wellentail more than 12 years&apos; service. This seems to us to be excessive. Toreduce the qualifying period to five years would, however, similarly requireservice in two Parliaments and probably represent about eight years&apos; service in practice. We think it would be reasonable if the qualifying period were reduced to correspond with the average life of a normal Parliament, i.e.four years&apos; service.57. Recommendation: We recommend that the qualifying period fora pension under the Members&apos; pension scheme should be reduced to fouryears.Reckonable service58. The present requirement that the pension should be based only oncompleted whole years of service may be administratively convenient, butit can also have the effect of denying a Member credit for many months ofservice. We consider that completed days should be used as the basisof assessment.59. Recommendation: We recommend that the basis for assessingreckonable service should be changed to completed days.Retirement age60. It has been represented to us that Parliamentary life places a heavy strain on Members and that they should be permitted to retire on fullpension at an earlier age than 65, possibly on reaching 60 years. Anotherargument advanced in favour of lowering the retirement age is that itwould encourage older Members to make way for new blood. A lowering of the normal retirement age would, however, enable Members to enjoymore favourable terms in this respect than those available under theNational Insurance Act, as well as the great majority of occupational pension schemes. However, we see no objection to an early retirement option being available to those MPs who chose to retire from active life after reaching the age of 60, subject to an actuarial reduction being applied to the amountof pension payable, as is common in occupational pension schemes.61. Recommendation: We recommend that an early retirement optionfrom the age of 60 onwards should be provided on the basis of an actuariallyreduced pension.Retirement benefits62. We have mentioned briefly in paragraph 55 above the majoroccupational drawbacks involved in fixing pension rights in fixed cash terms.Many occupational pension schemes, and all those within the public services,express pension benefits as a proportion of final salary, determined forexample by averaging the remuneration paid over the last one to three yearsof service in accordance with Inland Revenue rules. This automaticallyensures that pensions are related to levels of salary current at the time of retirement, and we believe that the present review of Members&apos; remuneration
presents a convenient opportunity to amend the Members&apos; pension scheme inthis direction. Reviews of pay have been relatively infrequent, with the resultthat averaging of the remuneration paid over more than the last 12 monthscould cause considerable variation in the pensions payable. We suggest thatit might be appropriate, therefore, for final salary to be determined byaveraging over the last 12 months of service.63. As explained above, there are at present two rates of accrual ofpension entidement. The effect of having two rates is that for long careersrelatively lower benefits, and for shorter careers relatively higher benefitsaccrue, than for a normal straight-line scheme, such as generally appliesin the public services. We believe that the principle of differential accrualrates can no longer be justified, and in our view a single rate of accrualshould be introduced.64. The present Inland Revenue rules limit the maximum pension payable to two-thirds of final salary on the basis of 40 years&apos; service. Inthe private sector of industry, many occupational pension schemes foremployees at a similar level of salary to that of M Ps are designed to providebenefits up to these maximum limits. On the other hand, in the public services, the benefits are generally limited to a pension of one-half of finalsalary after 40 years, although in addition a terminal grant of one-and-a-halftimes the final salary is payable, the net effect of which is a total maximumretirement benefit equivalent to a pension of two-thirds of final salary. Weconsider that the rate of accrual of pension rights should be such as toprovide a pension of two-thirds of final salary after 40 years&apos; service, i.e.l/60th per year of service, with the right to commute a proportion sufficientto yield a lump sum of 3/80ths of final salary per year of service, inaccordance with Inland Revenue rules. (The effect for a man aged 65 with40 years&apos; service would be to provide a cash payment of one-and-a-halftimes final salary and to reduce the pension payable to one-half of finalsalary.)65. Under the Governmenfs new pension policy, occupational pension schemes, after 1975, will be encouraged to maintain the value of pensionsagainst inflation. Members&apos; pensions are funded and the size of any futureincrease depends upon the surplus available. For Members&apos; pensions tohave their value maintained against inflation it would be necessary for theamount of the Exchequer support to be varied so that the surplus wasadequate for this purpose. Legislation has recently been enacted for the review of public service pensions at biennial intervals and for automaticadjustments to cover rises in the cost of living.* We consider that thepensions of M Ps should be adjusted from time to time on a similar basis.66. Recommendation: We recommend that the annual rate of accrualof pension rights should be changed to l/60th of final salary averaged overthe last 12 months of service, with an option to commute for cash a proportion sufficient to yield a lump sum of up to 3/80ths of final salary,for each year of service. Provision should be made to maintain the value ofpensions against future rises in the cost of living, as in the case of other public service pensions.* Pensions (Increase) Act, 1971.
67. Most occupational pension schemes in the public services provide( ) for the payment of a lump sum when an employee dies in service in additionto a widow&apos;s pension. The present scheme for MPs provides for thepayment of a pension to a widow of one-half of the pension paid ornotionally payable to the deceased Member, but makes no provision forthe payment of a lump sum benefit. We have received representations from the Trustees of the Members&apos; Pension Fund both for the introductionof such a payment and for an increase in the proportion of pension payable to a widow to two-thirds. We are sympathetic to the case for some payment to assist the widow of a Member who dies in service to cope with the problems which arise immediately and to avoid immediate financialanxiety. A lump sum death benefit equivalent to 12 months&apos; pay, as inthe public services&apos; schemes, would, we consider, be appropriate. We donot consider, however, that there should be any increase in the scale of the widow&apos;s pension.68. Recommendation: We recommend that a lump sum equivalent to12 months&apos; salary should be paid in respect of Members who die in service.Other pension matters69. We have also been asked to consider the possibilities of extending the payment of pensions to MPs who retired prior to the commencementof the pension scheme in October 1964, of providing for full credit for allservice prior to that date in place of the present limit of 10 years, and of granting pensions to Members retiring prematurely due to ill-health. Wedo not feel able, however, to modify the recommendations on these points of the Lawrence Committee. The inclusion of former Members would be contrary to normal pension practice, while the changed retirement benefitswe are recommending will greatly enhance the pensions payable to those members who have reckonable service prior to October 1964, the cost ofwhich will have to be met by increased contributions from the Exchequer.70. We also believe that it would be more appropriate for any casesof hardship among former Members who retired before October 1964, aswell as cases arising from early retirement due to ill-health, to be met bygrants from the Members&apos; Fund, depending on the circumstances of individual cases. As we have indicated earlier the need for the fund will eventually disappear but it will no doubt continue to have an importantfunction to perform for many years.Contributions71. The changes which we have recommended represent a considerable improvement in the benefits provided by the existing pension scheme, andwill increase the total cost by approximately one-half. The question arises whether equal contributions in respect of current service should continue tobe paid by Members and the Exchequer. In the majority of contributorypension schemes, the employer pays more than the employee. The principlethat the employer should pay more than the employee is also accepted inthe Governments recent proposals for the State reserve occupational pension
scheme, where the proportion paid by the employer has been fixed atfive-eighths of the total contribution, the employee paying the remainingthree-eighths.72. While we accept that the Exchequer is being required to make asubstantial deficiency contribution to pay for the back-service credits ofexisting Members, and will be required to make an additional contributionif our recommendations for changing the method of assessment of pension rights are accepted, we nevertheless feel that the apportionment ofcontributions in the future should be brought more into line with general practice. As new Members enter the scheme, other Members will beretiring, and the amount of deficiency contribution required should begin to fall away. The cost of all the recommendations which we have madehas been estimated by the Government Actuary as equivalent to 13  percent of salary. We consider that the proportion of this cost to be borneby Members should be three-eighths, which would involve a contribution of approximately 5 per cent of salary,73. Recommendation: We recommend that in future Members ofParliament should contribute approximately three-eighths of the cost oftheir pension scheme, the remainder to be met by the Exchequer.74. The changes which we have recommended involve a considerablerestructuring of the pension arrangements for MPs; for convenience, wesummarise the revised scheme which we propose in Appendix H.
PART IIREMUNERATION OF ministers and OTHER PAID OFFICE-HOLDERSCHAPTER 6PRESENT PAY STRUCTURE75. Ministers received remuneration long before it was introduced forM Ps, and by modern standards the salaries paid a hundred or more yearsago were much higher than they are today. For example, the salary receivedby a senior Minister between 1830 and 1914, a period of comparative stability of prices, was in real terms over three times that received by his counterparttoday, who also pays a far higher rate of taxation. Since the introductionof a salary for Members of Parliament, the remuneration of Ministers hasbeen reviewed at the same intervals, but it has been altered rather lessfrequently.76. The present salaries, which have been paid to Ministers and office-holders since 1 April, 1965, stem from the report of the Lawrence Committeein 1964, and reflect only one half of the increases then recommended. Since1937 the Prime Minister has been paid a higher salary than other cabinet ministers, and since 1947 part of his salary has been free of tax to allow for expenses. At present the Prime Minister^ salary is  14,000 a year,of which  4,000 is free of tax. Ministers and paid office-holders, other thanthe Prime Minister, the Lord Chancellor, the Law Officers and certain otherexceptions, fall for salary purposes into five groups, as follows:Cabinet Ministers (together with certain senior Ministersoutside the Cabinet and certain Ministers of State)      ... 8,500Other senior Ministers (and some Ministers of State)     ... 7,625Other Ministers of State       ............... 5,625Parliamentary Secretaries (and Under-Secretaries of State) ... 3,750Government Whips     ............     ...... 3,000The exceptions include the Chief Government Whips who are paid  5,625and  4,500 in the House of Commons and House of Lords respectively,and the Deputy Chief Whips, who are paid  3,300 in both Houses.77. Although a Member of the Cabinet, the Lord Chancellor^ salary hascustomarily been attributable to his other responsibilities as Head of the judiciary, and as Speaker of the House of Lords. His present salaryis  14,500, composed of a judicial element of  10,500, and  4,000 as speaker of the House of Lords.   The Law Officers originally received fees for25
contentious business in addition to a salary, but these have now been abolished in favour of an inclusive salary. Their salaries are now asfollows: Attorney-General        ..................   13,000Solicitor-General ..................    9,000Lord Advocate.....................    8,000Solicitor-General for Scotland...............    5,62578. The remaining office-holders are either concerned with the procedure and administration of the two Houses of Parliament or holdappointments as members of the official Opposition. In mostinstances their salary is directly related to one of the main classes of minister. The present salaries are:A.  House of Commons Mr. Speaker     ..................... 8,500Chairman of Ways and Means       ............ 4,875Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means     ......... 3,750Leader of the Opposition      ............... 4,500Chief Opposition Whip ............... 3,750B.  House of LordsLord Chairman of Committees............. 4,875Leader of the Opposition      ............... 2,000Chief Opposition Whip ............... 1,500Like the Prime Minister, the Speaker has  4,000 of his salary tax free tomeet expenses.79. For the purposes of travelling and other expenses incurred on ministerial business, a Minister of the Crown is treated in exactly thesame way as the most senior civil servants. Certain Ministers are provided with houses at the public expensed No rent is charged for this accommoda-tion, and normal maintenance and other costs are borne by the State; but any domestic staff employed are the responsibility of the occupant.80. Ministers and other paid office-holders who are Members of theHouse of Commons, are paid a Parliamentary salary of  15250 in addition totheir Ministerial salaries. This Parliamentary allowance was designed tocover the expenses of perfonning the Parliamentary duties which arise from the representation of a constituency. In addition, they are entitled tothe secretarial allowance of up to  500 a year, and to all the facilities provided to Members of the House of Commons, including free travelbetween Westminster, constituency and home, or the payment of car mileageallowance in lieu. Ministers and office-holders in the House of Lords,although not eligible for the daily expenses allowance introduced in 1957,have been entitled since 1947, in common with other Peers, to reimbursement of their travelling expenses between their homes and Westminster for thepurpose of attending the House of Lords. A full list of the present salaries for individual Ministers and office-holders is given in Appendix I.* See Appendix I for details.
THE ISSUES RELATING TO THE PAY OF ministers and OFFICE-HOLDERS81. The problem of identifying basic principles which can be used in determining the level of remuneration is no less difficult in the case ofMinisters than in that of Members of Parliament. If the problem is looked at in terms of supply and demand there is again no shortage of candidates.However, we have found some evidence, although less than is often asserted,of the refusal to accept junior Ministerial appointments, apparently on financial grounds. While too low a level of payment is unlikely to leadto a serious problem in filling Ministerial appointments in the short term,the effects could be damaging in the longer term if potential candidates feeleither that the acceptance of a Ministerial post would involve them in financial hardship, or that they could secure a substantially better standard ofliving by pursuing some other occupation.82. Strong feelings were expressed by many Ministers and ex-ministers in both Houses on the low level of Ministerial remuneration. Nearly halfof those who responded to our questionnaire commented to this effect. Wehave been urged by many of those giving evidence, either orally or inwriting, to look with particular closeness at the position of Junior Ministers,who are said in many cases to find considerable difficulty in maintainingthemselves and their families at the present level of remuneration, and insome cases to have suffered a sharp deterioration in their financial positionas a result of accepting office. Although a Parliamentary Secretary receivesa Ministerial salary of  3,750, his Parliamentary salary is reduced immediately on appointment by  2,000 to  1,250, and the Parliamentary expenses whichhe may claim as deductible for tax are limited to the latter amount. Heis also debarred by virtue of holding Ministerial office from the pursuit ofany other occupation. Moreover, on appointment, as Ministers are based in London, he can no longer claim a tax deduction for the cost of Londonaccommodation^ Individual cases were cited of Junior Ministers whoseincome had been reduced by more than half on taking up appointment. Itwas felt that this state of affairs must lead to a lowering in the status ofMinisters and the discouragement of able people from entering politics.83. In Chapter 3 we drew attention to the effect of inflation on the salary of MPs. The effect on the salaries of Ministers and other office-holders has been similar. For example, allowing for the rise in prices sinceApril 1965, the real value of a Cabinet Ministers salary of  8,500 has fallen by nearly 40 per cent, to about  5,200. The following table shows thecurrent salaries paid to the main classes of Ministers and office-holders andtheir equivalent value up-dated to allow for the intervening rises in prices and salaries respectively:: Some Ministers can be based in Cardiff and Edinburgh.27

In our public attitude survey we found that there was a roughbalance between those members of the public who considered the salary of a Cabinet Minister to be too high and those who thought it was aboutright or too low. However, only one in eight of the public interviewed was able to state correctly the range in which a Cabinet Ministers salary falls, andmost considerably underestimated the salary level, reflecting the difficultyexperienced by many people in estimating salaries well above their ownlevel. When people were informed of the actual remuneration of cabinet ministers, there was, unlike the case of M Ps, little change in their attitudes,as shown below:Table FAttitude to pay before and after being informed of actual remuneration	Cabinet Ministers		Before	After	(per cent)	(per cent)Overpaid.........	41	42Adequate.........	37	46Underpaid        ......	9	Don&apos;t know       ......	13	3            X&apos;;-.-!Source: OME Survey.85. In our examination of the practice in foreign and commonwealth countries, we found that the salary paid to senior Ministers varies between 12,500 (Netherlands) and  3,500 (Irish Republic), with an average of
 7,000. We arc not in a position to compare the responsibilities involved.A few countries pay an expenses allowance to Ministers, which variesbetween  580 and  830 a year, but it is fairly general practice for ministers to be paid their full Parliamentary salary, where this is constitutionallypossible.86. It has been frequently put to us in evidence that Ministers shouldreceive the same Parliamentary salary as ordinary Members of Parliament,so that they can claim their Parliamentary expenses up to the full limitavailable to Members of Parliament in general. Their duties as Members, itis said, do not become any less onerous when they are appointed Ministers.Some Ministers pointed out that the lime available to deal with the generalwork falling lo Members was reduced on becoming a Minister, and thatthis necessitated extra help and involved additional costs. Against this view it may be argued that appointment to a Ministerial post must certainly affectthe representative role of a Member to some extent: his duties at Westminsterbecome essentially Ministerial in character. Ministers cannot raise con-stituency matters in the House nor take part in Select Committees. Thereis, therefore, a case for saying that only that part of the Parliamentary salarywhich can be regarded as related to constituency duties should be paid loMinisters, or at least that some reduction in the level of parliamentary salary should be made on these grounds. Indeed the concept applied by the lawrence Committee, and earlier, in fixing the amount of parliamentary salary for Ministers was that it should represent the average amount of expenses incurred in carrying out Parliamentary duties; in other words itwas not intended to contain any element of remuneration beyond what was likely to be necessary to cover expenses. We think that this goes too farand that some element of remuneration should be allowed for the time spentby Ministers in attending to the interests of their constituents. Our survey of hours spent on Parliamentary work shows no significant difference between ministers and other Members in regard to hours spent outside the house on behalf of constituents, although hours spent inside the House show amarked reduction, which is more than compensated by the hours spent ondepartmental and other work outside the House. Unfortunately this informa-tion is based on a small number of icturns.87. We have found the problem of determining the amount ofParliamentary salary which should be paid to Ministers to be one of themore difficult we have had to face. We are inclined to feel, however, thatto pay Ministers the full Parliamentary salary payable to ordinary Memberswithout abatement would be over generous and, after a great deal of consideration, we have reached the conclusion that an appropriate amountat the present time would be  3,000; but, in proposing this amount, we donot mean to imply that the same fraction of the full Parliamentary salarywill always be appropriate in the future.88. Although we have found support for the view that in settingMinisterial salaries some regard should be had to the levels of remunerationprevailing at the higher levels in industry and the professions, there wouldappear to be general acceptance that it is impracticable, in view of thespecial character of the Ministerial function, to draw precise comparisons
89. The specific comparison or relationship most frequently raised with us is that between Ministers and senior civil servants. It is argued, forexample, that the pay of a Departmental Minister should exceed, if onlymarginally, the pay of a Permanent Secretary (Permanent Secretaries ingeneral receive  14,000 per year as compared with the  8,500 received by cabinet Ministers). While only a small proportion of Ministers and ex-Ministers included in our survey, about one in five, suggested that ministerial salaries should be firmly linked either in terms of amount or movement to civil Service salaries at comparable levels of responsibility, a much higher proportion, about one in three, considered that Ministerial salaries shouldtake some account of Civil Service levels of pay, generally to provide somelead over the salaries of the most senior civil servants with whom theynormally dealt. Against this it can be argued that Ministers and top civilservants are two quite distinct occupational groups, with quite different rolesand functions (albeit that they overlap), and that their pay should be deter-mined independently of each other. It was conveyed to us that no difficultyor embarrassment had arisen from the fact that a Minister in charge of a department received a smaller salary than his Permanent Secretary. Weincline to the latter point of view, and we think that the salaries of thesetwo groups are matters for separate consideration.90. We have received evidence on the question of Ministers in theHouse of Lords. Our Parliamentary system is bicameral and the questionof Ministerial remuneration cannot be properly considered without taking into account the circumstances applying in both Houses. It was pointedout that the Upper House, like the Lower, has also changed substantially in its composition and it was often not easy for some Peers to acceptMinisterial appointments. A Peer accepting an appointment, for example asa Lord-in-Waiting (Lei a Government Whip) at a salary of  3,000, was, like other Ministers or office-holders, debarred from pursuing any otheroccupation. There was some feeling that there should be no difference in the emoluments paid to Ministers at a given level in either House, but ministers in the House of Lords, unlike their colleagues in the Commons, do nothave constituency duties and therefore do not receive a parliamentary salary. The view was also expressed that Ministers in the Lords shouldreceive a special allowance to compensate for the loss of the Peer&apos;s expensesallowance for attendance. More generally, for Peers actively engaged in politics, there were often costs of having to live in London, and of obtainingsecretarial help. Suggestions were made to us for a two-level attendance allowance and for the payment of a Parliamentary salary. Although wehave felt it right to mention these various points concerning the House ofLords, only those directly relating to Ministerial remuneration fall within our terms of reference.91. It has been suggested to us that, in formulating our recommendations on the remuneration of Ministers, we should start from the figures proposedby the Lawrence Committee, which in the event were reduced by theGovernment of the day.  We have felt, however, that we should take an
entirely fresh view of this matter, starting from the situation as we nowfind it. Our recommendations have been formed in the light of all theevidence and arguments submitted to us, and we have decided to recommendtotal salary levels, taking account of the element of Parliamentary salary,which, while not attempting to compete directly with the very highestlevels obtainable in industry and the professions that in our view would notbe realistic or desirable fairly reflect the very heavy responsibilities carried by Ministers and the importance of their role in the life of the nation.Our detailed recommendations are set out in the next chapter.
RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE REMUNERATION OFMINISTERS AND OFFICE-HOLDERSParliamentary salary92. In the previous chapter we discussed among other points the questionof the Parliamentary salary payable to Ministers and concluded that thisshould be sufficient to provide an element of remuneration, as well ascovering expenses, in recognition of the general duties which a Ministercontinues to carry as a Member of Parliament, as distinct from hisMinisterial duties. We explained that we had assessed the appropriatelevel of payment at  3,000.93. Recommendation: We recommend that Ministers and other paidoffice-holders who are Members of the House of Commons should receive a parliamentary salary of  3,000 a year.94. Our recommendation takes into account the improved allowancesrecommended for M Ps, including London supplement, from which ministers in the House of Commons will also benefit.The Prime Minister95. The office of Prime Minister is, of course, unique in the Ministerialstructure. Some might argue that his salary should, on principle, be higher than any other in the public area as a whole. We do not ourselves,in spite of the immense responsibilities involved, think that this follows,since quite different factors are involved in determining the pay for otherkey jobs in the public sector. We are in no doubt, however, that thepresent salary for this office is well below the appropriate level.96. Recommendation: We recommend that the Prime Minister shouldbe paid a salary of  20,000 a year, of which  5,000 should be allowed as a flat rate deduction for expenses free of tax.Ministers (other than the Prime Minister, the Lord Chancellor and the LawOfficers)97. In the present structure of Ministerial offices there are a numberof levels at each of which the responsibilities carried are roughly comparable.These are, first, Cabinet Ministers, on whom rests the responsibility for major collective decisions of policy in conjunction with their colleagues, andwho together give direction to the course of Government. Secondly, belowthe Cabinet, there are a number of Departmental offices filled by ministers and by Ministers of State; most of the former and all the latter are sub-ordinate to Secretaries of State of large Departments. Thirdly, there areParliamentary Secretaries or Junior Ministers, whose prime responsibilitylies in interpreting Departmental policy determined by the more seniorDepartmental Ministers, and whose office often represents an apprenticeship
to higher Ministerial office. Cabinet Ministers and Junior Ministersrepresent two well defined classes for which fixed salary levels are appropriate; in order, however, to allow for some flexibility, we have thoughtit best to propose a broad salary range for the intermediate levels, the limits of which are intended to correspond to the higher and lower levels of intermediate responsibility currently found, and within which the salaries for individual posts can be fixed as appropriate.98. Recommendation: We recommend that Ministers, other than thePrime Minister, the Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers, should be paid the following salaries a year:Recommendedsalary 13,000I 9,500-7,5005,500The Lord Chancellor99. The office of Lord Chancellor is unique in that it combines by long tradition the function of Head of the Judiciary with the ministerialduties of a Cabinet Minister. In addition to these functions the LordChancellor is also Speaker of the House of Lords. The major portion ofthe Lord Chancellors salary is attributed to his position as Head of the judiciary and the remainder to his Speakership. Thus it has been customaryfor the salary to be altered at the same time as the salaries of othermembers of the Higher Judiciary. Since 1965 the salaries of members ofthe Higher Judiciary have been capable of alteration by Order in Councilsubject to the affirmative resolution procedure, but alterations in the lord chancellor&apos;s salary still require legislation by Act of Parliament. It hasbeen represented to us that the Lord Chancellors salary should also be madecapable of alteration by Order in Council. We cannot accept this proposal,however, because we think it would lay undue emphasis on the judicialas opposed to the ministerial nature of the office. We consider that in modern conditions the Lord Chancellors functions are very largelyministerial in character, perhaps increasingly so having regard to the considerable additional administrative burdens placed on him by the recentreorganisation of the Courts&apos; system. We think that the Lord Chancellorssalary should be dealt with by legislation along with other Ministers.Nevertheless we agree with the Lawrence Committee&apos;s view that the status and prestige of this constitutionally exceptional and highly important office should be reflected in the amount of his salary, which should take intoaccount the levels of both ministerial and judicial salaries.100. Recommendation: We recommend that the Lord chancellor should be paid a total salary of  20,000 a year, of which  2,500 should bein recognition of his function as Speaker of the House of Lords. We furtherrecommend that future changes in the salary of the Lord Chancellor shouldbe enacted in common with those applying to other Ministers.Presentsalary Cabinet Minister      .........       8,500Minister not in the Cabinet        ...       7,625Minister of State      .........        5,625Parliamentary Secretary or Under-Secretary of State.........       3,750

The functions of the Law Officers, both in England and inScotland, are described in some detail in the Lawrence Committee&apos;s report.*It may be sufficient for us to say here that we do not differ from the viewof that Committee that these functions are of a specialised nature, thatthey are of a highly responsible and burdensome character, and that it isof great importance that they should be skilfully and conscientiouslyperformed by lawyers of high standing in their profession. We also agreethat the level of salary attaching to the offices should be sufficient toemphasise their importance in the eyes of the legal profession in both countries, and thus to attract lawyers of the right quality to Parliament.102. We have had some evidence that the duties of the offices are increasing, particularly in the case of the Lord Advocate as a result of thelarge amount of &apos; consequential&apos; legislation for Scotland. The special position of the Law Officers has been reflected in the high salaries paidto them relative to other Ministers, and the importance of recruiting tothe offices lawyers of the necessary professional competence. There is atpresent a very considerable differential between the salaries paid to theEnglish Law Officers and the Lord Advocate and to other senior Ministers.We believe that this situation is unsatisfactory, not because the Law Officers&apos;salaries have been too high in relation to professional earnings at theEnglish and Scots Bars, but because other ministerial salaries have been too low. We consider it is important that the Law Officers&apos; salaries shouldnot be too far out of line with current professional earnings, and we havehad evidence that they are so at present, certainly in the case of the solicitor-General for Scotland. We must have regard, however, to theirrelationship to the salaries of other Ministers and there appears to be noreason to suppose that the responsibilities of the Attorney-General, forexample, are so significantly heavier than those of a Cabinet Minister asto justify the maintenance of the present differentials in the new salary structure we are proposing for other Ministers. The responsibilities of theLord Advocate are less extensive than those of the Attorney-General. Butwe consider that the salary for this office should be not less than that ofthe Solicitor-General for England, and that the Solicitor-General for scotland should have a relatively higher salary than has hitherto attached to that office.103. Recommendation: We recommend that the Law Officers shouldbe paid the following salaries a year:
	Present	Recommended	salary	salary	 	 Chief Whip, House of Commons ...	5,625	9,500Chief Whip, House of Lords	4,500	6,500Deputy Chief Whips, both Houses   ...	3,300	5,000Other Government Whips, House of		Lords         ............	3,000	4,500Other Government Whips, House of		Commons    ............	3,000	&apos; 4,000Opposition Leaders and Whips in both Houses106. Our Parliamentary system requires a strong and effectiveOpposition, and its constitutional significance has been formally recognisedsince 1937 by the grant of a salary from public funds to its Leader. the changing style of politics in recent times has entailed a considerable growth in the responsibilities carried by, and the demands (many of them entailingconsiderable expense) made upon, the Leader of the Opposition. His rolerequires that, in consultation with his colleagues in the Shadow Cabinet,he must continually make decisions, both of a tactical and a longer-termnature, which may be as critical in their implications to the course ofnational politics as the decisions of those in Government office. For these reasons we are in no doubt that the salary of the Leader of the opposition should be substantially increased.107. From the evidence put to us we have little doubt that in the Houseof Commons a greater weight of responsibility falls on the Opposition chief whip than on any other member of the Opposition save the Leader of theOpposition himself. Other Opposition Whips in the House of Commons,however, must also apply themselves to their duties on a more or lessfull-time basis if the business of the House is to be carried out properlyand effectively. We think that the Leader of the Opposition shouldbe enabled to nominate two additional Whips to whom a salary shouldbe paid.104. We consider that the Government Chief Whip in the House ofCommons should be paid at the highest level in the intermediate scale for ministers. We are convinced that this is right bearing in mind his heavyresponsibilities in respect of Parliamentary business and as political adviser to (although not a Member of) the Cabinet. The other Government Whips,carrying such offices as Junior Lords of the Treasury in the House ofCommons and Lords-in-Waiting in the House of Lords, are required to perform a variety of duties concerned with ensuring the smooth running ofbusiness in both Houses of Parliament. In addition the Government Whipsin the House of Lords have extra duties as Departmental spokesmen.105. Recommendation: We recommend that the Government Whipsshould be paid the following salaries a year:
	Present	Recommended	salary	salary	  lei&apos;!/:	ioJvi--ij  iirt^House of Commons		Leader of the Opposition	4,500	9,500Opposition Chief Whip   ......	3,750	7,500Two other Opposition Whips	Nil	4,000House of Lords		Leader of the Opposition	2,000	3,500Opposition Chief Whip   ......	1,500	2,500Mr. Speaker109. It has been customary for Mr. Speaker to be paid a salaryequivalent to that of a Cabinet Minister and to have a flat rate deductionfor expenses as for the Prime Minister. We consider that this shouldcontinue.110. Recommendation: We recommend that Mr. Speaker should bepaid a salary of  13,000 a year, of which  4,000 should be allowed as a flat rate deduction for expenses free of tax.Other Officers of both Houses111. In the House of Commons, Mr. Speaker is assisted by the chairman and the Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means. In the House of Lords,the Lord Chancellor, as Speaker, is assisted by the Lord Chairman of committees, who carries out a very large part of the duties involved in thework of the House, both on the floor and in committee. The salaryattached to this office has corresponded to that of the Chairman of ways and Means in the House of Commons and we think that this shouldcontinue.112. Recommendation: We recommend that the other officers of bothHouses should be paid the following salaries a year:	Present	Recommended	salary	salary	 	 House of Commons		Chairman of Ways and Means	4,875	6,750Deputy Chairman of Ways and		Means     ............	3,750	5,500House of Lords		Lord Chairman of Committees	4,875	6,750
PENSION ARRANGEMENTS FOR MINISTERS113. We turn now to the question of pension arrangements for ministers and other paid office-holders. At present there are no pension arrangementsother than for the Prime Minister, Mr. Speaker and the Lord Chancellor,for whom statutory pensions of fixed amounts are provided.Ministers and paid office-holders other than those in receipt of statutorypensions114. A Member on appointment as a Minister or as a paid office-holdercontinues to participate in the Members&apos; pension scheme at the same level of contribution and benefit as an ordinary MP, but no additional pensioncover is provided in relation to the higher level of remuneration he receivesas a Minister or as an office-holder. Bearing in mind that Ministers andother paid office-holders in the House of Commons are unable to follow anyother paid occupation while in office, we think that they should be giventhe opportunity to earn pension entitlement in respect of their higher totalremuneration by means of an additional voluntary contribution to be augmented by the Exchequer. Ministers and other paid office-holders inthe House of Lords should, we think, similarly be given the opportunity of acquiring entitlement to a pension related to their Ministerial earnings by voluntary contributions under these arrangements.115. The necessary arrangements might take the form of a separatescheme, with an option to contract out for Ministers and office-holders who wished to do so; but if possible, it would clearly be an advantage for thearrangements to be combined with the Members&apos; pension scheme, and for asimilar scale of contribution and pension entitlement to be applied. Becausethe length and timing of periods in office, however, will vary considerably,depending on the course of the individual^ career, it would seem appropriate that the rate at which pension entitlement accrues should be related to theamount of additional earnings over the full Parliamentary salary of an ordinary M P in the case of Members of the House of Commons, or thefull Ministerial or official salary in the case of those in the House of Lords.116. Recommendation: We recommend that optional pensionarrangements should be provided for Ministers and other paid office-holdersin both Houses of Parliament, under which pension rights additional to anyaccruing under the scheme for Members of the House of Commons maybe purchased by voluntary contribution to be supplemented by theExchequer.Prime Minister, Mr. Speaker and the Lord Chancellor117. The statutory pensions currently attached to the offices of thePrime Minister, Mr. Speaker and the Lord Chancellor are  4,000,  5,000and  6,250 per year respectively.   Holders of these offices are entitled to
these amounts on retirement irrespective of the length of time for whichthey held them. Contributions made to the Members&apos; pension scheme arerefunded on appointment. If our recommendations are accepted, then, inthe future, under the new Government policy for the preservation of accruedpension rights the refunding of contributions will not be allowed after the relatively short qualifying period of four years has been served.118. We consider that future holders of the office of Prime Ministerand Mr. Speaker should be enabled to continue to participate in theMembers&apos; pension scheme, but that it would not be appropriate forthem or the Lord Chancellor to have the option of participating in the supplementary pension arrangements which we have proposed for ministers and office-holders in general. The statutory pensions attachedto these offices, should we think now be increased to take accountof the revised salaries which we have recommended, and in the case of theLord Chancellor to bring the relationship which the pension bears to his salary more closely into line with the arrangements for the judiciary. we feel, however, that consideration should be given in the future to fixing thesestatutory pensions as a percentage of salary, thereby removing the need to reconsider their amount on each occasion that the salary is revised.119. Recommendation: We recommend that statutory pensions of 7,500,  6,500 and  8,500 should be attached at the present time to the offices of the Prime Minister, Mr. Speaker and the Lord Chancellorrespectively. We further recommend that future holders of the offices of prime Minister and Mr. Speaker, who are in receipt of a parliamentary salary as a Member of Parliament, should continue to participate in theMembers&apos; pension scheme, but that neither they nor the Lord chancellor should be eligible, while holding these offices, to participate in the optionalpension arrangements proposed for Ministers and office-holders generally.
PART chapter 10SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS120. The long period of seven years which has elapsed since the lastmajor review of the pay of Members of Parliament and Ministers has made it inevitable that we should find it necessary to recommend substantial changes, both by way of increased salaries and reimbursement of expenses.We have seen our task as being not merely up-dating existing levels of remuneration, but also as involving some element of revaluation in orderto take account of changes in the work, particularly of MPs. So far asthe MP&apos;s salary is concerned, the increase which we are proposing is38 per cent, which is equivalent to an annual compound rate of increaseof 4-7 per cent since 1964, as compared with a rise in the cost of livingover this period of 44 per cent and with a general rise in salaries of 67 percent. We have limited the increase in the salary because we are alsorecommending important and much-needed changes in the treatment of expenses. It is an integral part of our proposals that so far as possible theexpenses of MPs should be reimbursed as in other occupations. we estimate that as a result of our recommendations the average net pay of aMember of Parliament, i.e. after meeting all residual expenses but beforetax, will be approximately  4,250 a year.121. When the last review was carried out, the Government of the daydid not see fit, because of the economic situation of the country, to implementin full the recommendations on Ministerial salaries. Indeed the history ofthe remuneration both of Ministers and of Members of Parliament is oneof repeated compromise in the light of current economic circumstances. we recognise fully the concern of the Government to contain wage and salary increases, but having given full weight to this we are in no doubt that substantial changes are necessary. We have been conscious of the declaredintention of the present Government to implement our proposals unless there are clear and compelling reasons for not doing so. We have regardedthis as placing on us an added responsibility to keep our recommendations for increases and improvements to the absolute minimum which we consider to be necessary. It is in our view of the highest importance that these recommendations, both as they affect salaries and allowances, should nowbe implemented as a whole and in full.123, We summarise below the main recommendations in our report:Pay of Members of Parliament(a) The salary of Members of Parliament should be increased to 4,500 a year. (Paragraph 37.)
(b) A scheme should be introduced for the payment of a subsistence allowance and London Supplement. Provision should be made for thescale of these payments to be adjusted in line with adjustments made from time to time in the appropriate Civil Service scales. (Paragraph 41.)(c) Travelling expenses of journeys made by Members of parliament in the performance of their Parliamentary duties within their constituencies, and to central and local Government authorities whichare concerned with their constituency areas but are located outside theirconstituency boundaries, should be reimbursed on a basis similar to that now applying to journeys between Westminster and their constituencies.(Paragraph 42 (a).)(d) Two funds should be established to meet the costs of travelwithin the United Kingdom and overseas respectively, which might be administered by an all-party committee of the House of Commons, andto which individual Members could apply for assistance. The funds should be supported by annual subscriptions from the Exchequer,which we suggest should amount in the first instance to  10,000 and 20,000 respectively.   (Paragraph 42(b).)(e) Free travelling facilities by air, rail or sea public transport shouldbe provided for wives and husbands of Members for up to 10 returnjourneys a year in total between Westminster and the Member&apos;sconstituency, or Westminster and home.  (Paragraph 42 (c).)(f) The secretarial allowance should be increased to  1,000 a year,to meet both secretarial and general office expenses ofwhich up to  300 should be permitted to be used to meet costs incurred in employing a research assistant on work undertaken in the properperformance of a Member&apos;s Parliamentary duties.   (Paragraph 45.)Severance arrangements(g) Members of Parliament should continue to be paid throughoutthe period of a dissolution and, in the event of losing their seat following a general election, should be entitled to claim a terminal grant equivalentto three months&apos; salary. The status of Members of Parliament underthe national insurance arrangements should in due course be reviewedwith a view to enabling them to draw unemployment benefit whenappropriate.   (Paragraph 52.)Members&apos; pensions(h) The qualifying period for a pension under the Members&apos; pension scheme should be reduced to four years. (Paragraph 57.)(0 The basis for assessing reckonable service should be changed tocompleted days.  (Paragraph 59.)(f) An early retirement option from the age of 60 onwards shouldbe provided on the basis of an actuarially reduced pension. (Paragraph61.)
(k) The annual rate of accrual of pension rights should be changed to 1 / 60th of final salary averaged over the last 12 months of service, withan option to commute for cash a proportion sufficient to yield a lump sum of up to 3/80ths of final salary, for each year of service. provision should be made to maintain the value of pensions against future rises in the cost of living, as in the case of other public service pensions.(Paragraph 66.)(0 A lump sum equivalent to 12 months&apos; salary should be paidin respect of Members who die in service. (Paragraph 68.)(m) In future Members of Parliament should contribute approximatelythree-eighths of the cost of their pension scheme, the remainder to bemet by the Exchequer.   (Paragraph 73.)Parliamentary Salary of Ministers and other paid office-holders(n) Ministers and other paid office-holders who are Members of theHouse of Commons should receive a Parliamentary salary of  3,000a year.  (Paragraph 93.)Pay of Ministers and other paid office-holders(o) The Prime Minister should be paid a salary of  20,000 a year,of which  5,000 should be allowed as a flat rate deduction for expensesfree of tax.  (Paragraph 96.)(p) Ministers other than the Prime Minister, the Lord chancellor and the Law Officers, should be paid the following salaries a year:Recommendedsalary 13,000\ 9,500-7,5005,500(Paragraph 98.)(q) The Lord Chancellor should be paid a total salary of  20,000a year, of which  2,500 should be in recognition of his function asSpeaker of the House of Lords. Future changes in the salary of the LordChancellor should be enacted in common with those applying to other ministers.   (Paragraph 100.)(r) The Law Officers should be paid the following salaries a year:	Present	Recommended	salary	salary	..,. .,.,.,	 Attorney-General     ......	...   13,000	14,500Solicitor-General      ......	...     9,000	11,000Lord Advocate        ......	8,000	11,000Solicitor-General for Scotland	5,625	7,750(Paragraph 103.)41Presentsalaryi . oif^W  -  Cabinet Minister      ......... 8,500Minister not in the Cabinet        ... 7,625Minister of State......... 5,625Parliamentary Secretary or Under-Secretary of State   ......... 3,750

(jc) Statutory pensions of  7,500,  6,500 and  8,500 should beattached at the present time to the offices of the Prime Minister,Mr. Speaker and the Lord Chancellor respectively. Future holders ofthe offices of Prime Minister and Mr. Speaker, who are in receipt of a parliamentary salary as a Member of Parliament, should continue toparticipate in the Members&apos; pension scheme, but neither they nor theLord Chancellor should be eligible, while holding these offices, toparticipate in the optional pension arrangements proposed for ministers and office-holders generally.   (Paragraph 119.)Future reviews123. We have commented earlier on the relative infrequency of reviews of the remuneration of Members of Parliament and Ministers in the past,and the difficulties to which this has given rise. It has been most stronglyrepresented to us that reviews should be more frequent, or that some means should be found of ensuring automatic adjustment from time to time. Forour part we consider that there should be a major comprehensive review at intervals of four years, i.e. corresponding roughly to once in the Ufetimeof each Parliament of normal length. However, we should not wish to exclude the possibility of an intermediate adjustment between major reviews.Boyle of HandsworthH. W. AtcherleyBeechtngGeorge ColdstreamAnthony LloydP. T.

Response to questionnaire1. Questionnaires were sent to all MPs on 1 July, 1971, for return by19 July. The total number of M Ps allowing for four pending by-electionswas 626 of whom 524, or 84 per cent, responded. The response from Ministersother than Junior Ministers was about average, but that from junior ministers and other office-holders was 100 per cent. Among other MPsthe response among former office-holders was rather higher than for theremainder.2. All the questionnaires received were adequately completed. Someof the questions inviting comments and proposals were often left blank, buta substantial proportion offered one or more comments or suggestions to themajority of these questions. There was some understandable confusionabout the different categories of expense covered by Questions 8, 9 and 10and some answers included under the wrong head have been transferred inthe analysis; moreover 19 London M Ps said that their residence for thepurpose of tax returns of Parliamentary expenses was elsewhere than inLondon, although the Inland Revenue would not in fact allow this.Tables3. The tables given in this appendix cover all the specific questions in the survey. They are discussed where appropriate in the relevant chaptersof the Report and are not therefore discussed in this appendix. A briefanalysis, however, is given below of the answers to the questions invitingwritten comments and suggestions. The questionnaire as a whole is notreproduced, but the form of the questions may be understood from the tables or notes below.Comments and proposals by members . Question 8 which asked about the adequacy of expenses on parliamentary business for which cash allowances, reimbursement or freefacilities are provided in whole or in part (see Table 10) was followed bya further question asking what increases or improvements were considered necessary for the items listed. An increase in the secretarial allowance was proposed by 365 Members. Over half these Members asked either for thecost of a full-time secretary to be paid or for an increase of  1,000 or more,but one-third of the increases asked for were for  500 or less. various proposals were made in regard to travel but the biggest demand was for anincrease in the number of warrants for wives with about half wanting free travel between London, home and constituency. Nearly one-third of theproposals, however, were for increasing the number of warrants up to betweenseven and twelve per year from the present four.5. For categories of expense on Parliamentary business deductible for tax only those which Members considered ought in principle to be coveredby an allowance, reimbursed or provided in kind are shown in Table 13.
Members were also asked for their reasons for these proposals. The main reasons given were that, as was done in other occupations, expenses shouldnot have to be met out of their salaries, but others felt that allowances would enable Members to obtain better facilities, and about 100 mentioned inparticular that it would be more equitable in covering the extra costs for members from non-London constituencies.6. For the remaining categories of expenses which are neither reimbursednor deductible for tax the question on the expenses incurred (see Table 14)was followed by a question on what additional facilities should be provided at the House with the aim of reducing any of these expenses. Of 221suggestions for improved facilities about 60 were for better office accommodation, 45 for research assistants and 26 for reduced charges formeals.7. Comments were invited on the question of the effect of involvementin outside occupations on the work of the House (Table 19). The majorityof those who thought it beneficial mentioned the advantages of keepingMPs informed and in touch with other activities and providing expert advice when required, but about 30 of these Members mentionedaccompanying disadvantages in the effect on Parliamentary work. Of the176 comments by those who considered it detrimental, 45 said that being anMP is a full-time job; others mentioned that the work of MPs sufferedalthough some considered it a financial necessity.8. Members were asked for any other proposals for revising the pension arrangements for Members, widows and dependants than those given in the question on pensions (see Table 21). Most of the other proposalsfor revising the pension arrangements, which totalled 350, were either foran increase in pension or a pension in line with a good outside scheme orfor improvements in pensions for widows; but 38 Members proposed pensionspayable at 60 and 15 mentioned the need for periodic review to take accountof inflation.9. Proposals were invited in regard to the question on short-termassistance (e.g. a terminal grant) on loss of seat (see Table 22). Of 240proposals, 74 mentioned a terminal grant and 107 suggested extending the salary for a period, nearly half proposing three months; 33 thought theproblem could be covered by unemployment benefit and/or redundancy payments (i.e. giving Ministers employed instead of self-employed status for national Insurance); 17 thought any grant should be means-tested or basedon hardship, while 9 considered that better pension provision would help.Proposals for determining remuneration of Members or office-holders10. The final question (Question 17) invited comments on how the remuneration of an MP or of an office-holder should be determined,e.g. whether it should be linked to any particular occupational group, onthe frequency or method of revision, or on any other aspect of remuneration and allowances of Members of Parliament. The answers to this questionshowed a widespread pre-occupation with the difficulty that Members feelthey have to face in having to determine their own remuneration. This is reflected in the fact that over 200 wanted to have their pay linked to a
grade in the Civil Service (generally Assistant Secretary) or exceptionallyanother occupational group, against 43 who said that the pay of M Ps couldnot be linked with that of any other occupation. Moreover a further 112Members mentioned the need for a regular pay review by an independent body; others mentioned specific periods for regular review, of which about45 were for once in each Parliament and 30 were for every two years.A further 19 favoured regular adjustments to keep pace with the cost ofliving or outside incomes. Most of the remaining comments were repetitionsof points made earlier in the questionnaire, except that the need for raisingMinisterial, particularly Junior Ministerial, salaries was mentioned by 40Members, most of whom were not office-holders.Table 1Members of Parliament: Response to Questionnaire	Total number of MPs	Number of M Ps returning questionnaires	Response rateMinister     ...............

EXPENSES ALLOWED BY INLAND REVENUE for tax purposes the analysis1. The tables show analyses of the expenses of MPs and Ministerscarried out by the Inland Revenue Department on behalf of the Office of manpower Economics. Analysis of M Ps&apos; total expenses have been carriedout on previous occasions. The present analysis is the first to give anitemised breakdown of these expenses; the tables show the averages of these items for both ordinary MPs and Ministers and, in addition for ordinaryMPs, analyses of each item by ranges of amounts in the 1969-70 taxyear (Ministers in this context include other office-holders).Basis of estimates2. Not all the expenses were agreed and in such cases the latest agreedfigures for an earlier year are substituted. The analysis is based for MPs(excluding Ministers) in 1969-70 on agreed figures for that year for328 Members and earlier figures (mainly for the previous year) for160 Members and for Ministers 55 agreed figures for 1969-70 and 21 agreedfigures for the previous year or earlier. Corresponding figures for 1968-69are for MPs (excluding Ministers) 456 agreed and 86 earlier, and for ministers 86 agreed and 3 earlier. Thus the estimates somewhat understatethe expenses in the years shown, particularly in 1969-70, as expenses tendto rise from year to year. The expenses for earlier years have to be included,since in general the expenses that are last to be claimed and agreed arehigher than average. The comparative figures shown for 1962-63, published by the Lawrence Committee, were on the same basis.Tables3. Tables 1 and 2 compare ranges of total expenses in 1969-70 forM Ps and Ministers respectively with 1962-63.

PROPOSED SCHEME FOR PAYMENT OF subsistence allowance  AND  LONDON   SUPPLEMENT  to members OF PARLIAMENT[The arrangements set out below are intended only as an outline, detailswill need to be determined by the appropriate authorities]general. Subsistence allowance would be intended to meet the cost of accommodation, meals, tips and other incidental expenses necessarilyincurred when Members were away from home and engaged on parliamentary duties. It would not be intended to cover the entire cost ofliving away from home but only the extra cost which a Member would haveto incur on being away from his place of residence.Place of residence and work2. A Member of Parliament would be regarded as carrying out theduties of his office in two places at Westminster and in his constituency.A London Member would be regarded as able to carry out both hisWestminster duties and his constituency duties from a home in London, sothat even if his home were away from London he would not be entitledto payment of subsistence allowance for living away from home whencarrying out his Parliamentary duties. A provincial Member having to takeadditional accommodation in London or his constituency, would be requiredto nominate either Westminster or his constituency as his place of residenceand usual place of work, and would then be eligible to receive payment of subsistence allowance in respect of the additional cost necessarily incurred in attending at his other place of work; provided that, if he had nominatedhis constituency as his place of residence, he was not in receipt of a freerailway season ticket or of car mileage allowance to cover the expenses ofjourneys between his home and London, while Parliament was in session.3. Provincial Members would also be eligible to receive payment of subsistence allowance in respect of additional costs necessarily incurred forovernight absence from their normal constituency base, when carrying outParliamentary duties within their constituency, if otherwise they would be involved in an unreasonably lengthy return journey. It would not be regardedas unreasonable if a Member were able to return home by usual mode oftransport by midnight.Subsistence allowance4. Subsistence allowance would be paid for overnight absence at thefollowing daily rates*:London Elsewhere 5-25  5-00* These suggested rates correspond with the regular visitor rates for Officers of Class A (1)in the Civil Service i.e. Officers in grades with a minimum salary not less than that of an assistant Secretary.
5. Subsistence allowancce would not be taxable, and would be payablesubject to periodic certification that the amount claimed had actually andnecessarily been expended for the purpose provided.London Supplement6. A London Member would be eligible to receive the addition ofLondon Supplement of  175* per year to his salary to cover the higher costof living in London as compared with the rest of the country. LondonSupplement would also be payable to a provincial Member who hadnominated London as his place of residence, but would not be payable toa Minister or other paid office-holder who was supplied with an officialresidence.&apos; This suggested amount corresponds to that paid to Civil Servants as London Weighting.90
PRESENT PENSION SCHEME AND MEMBERS&apos; FUNDI.  House of Commons Members&apos; Contributory Pension scheme. Establishment. The scheme was introduced following the report ofthe Lawrence Committee in 1964. It became effective from 16 October, 1964,and is governed by the Ministerial Salaries and Members&apos; Pensions Act 1965.2. Membership of the scheme is compulsory. All persons who becameMembers of the House of Commons on 16 October, 1964, or become members thereafter are required to participate in the scheme, with theexception of past and present Prime Ministers, Speakers of the House ofCommons and Lord Chancellors who are provided with ex-ofBcio pensionsfrom public funds.3. Qualification and reckonable service. The normal minimumpensionable age is 65. Members with 10 or more years&apos; reckonable servicequalify for benefit both for themselves and for their dependants. Membersmust also give notice that they will not seek re-election; however, if aMember does decide to seek re-election his pension is suspended fromnomination day. All service after 16 October, 1964, when the pension scheme was introduced, is reckonable and service immediately prior to this date up to a maximum of 10 years is also reckonable free of cost. Subjectto these conditions and provided contributions are not withdrawn, all brokenperiods of service are reckonable. Benefits are, however, related to completedyears of service only.4. Members&apos; pensions. The initial annual amount of a Member&apos;pension was at the rate of  60 for each of the first 15 years of reckonableservice and  24 for each year of reckonable service from 16 to 45 years.These rates were increased by one-fifth in 1971 as an interim measure ofpensions increase in the light of an actuarial surplus.5. Widows&apos; pension. The widow of a Member or former Member whohas completed 10 or more years&apos; reckonable service receives a pension atthe rate of one-half of her late husband&apos;s actual pension or of his accruedpension rights on the day of his death. Widows&apos; pensions are payable for life but cease in the event of remarriage. No pension is payable if atthe date of her husband&apos;s death the widow was cohabiting with anotherpension; it also ceases if she later cohabits with another person.6. Childreris pensions. A pension is payable in respect of eachdependent child under the age of 16, up to a maximum of four, of a deceasedMember or former Member who had completed 10 or more years&apos;reckonable service, at the rate of one-eighth of the Member&apos;s pension or pension entitlement. If no widow&apos;s pension is payable, the children&apos;pension is increased by a further one-eighth for each child subject to amaximum of one-half the Member&apos;s pension or pension entitlement.Payment continues for each child up to his 22nd birthday or the date onwhich he ceases full-time education, whichever is the earlier.
7. Incapacitated widower of a woman Member. A pension similar tothe widow&apos;s pension is payable to the widower of a woman Member of former Member if he was dependent upon her at the time of her deathand was incapable by reason of age or bodily or mental infirmity of earninghis own living.8. Refund of contributions. The contributions paid by a Member, whois not in receipt of a pension, are refundable with interest accumulated atthe rate of 3 per cent per year if he dies before receiving a pension andif there is no contingent liability for a widow&apos;s, dependent widower&apos;s orchildren&apos;s pension; if he had ceased to be a Member, has attained age 65and gives notice to the Trustees requesting the refund; if five years have elapsed since he ceased to be a Member and he gives notice to the Trusteesrequesting the refund; or if he becomes Prime Minister, Speaker of theHouse of Commons or Lord Chancellor. Alternatively, if a Member&apos;pension, having commenced, ceases either on his death or because he is appointed Prime Minister, Speaker or Lord Chancellor, and the amount hehas received in pension is less than the total of his contributionsaccumulated with interest, a lump sum payment may be due. Members,who withdraw their contributions and are subsequently re-elected, may repay the refund with interest to reinstate the earlier period of reckonable service.9. Members&apos; contributions. Members contribute at a fixed rate of 150 per year from their Parliamentary salary in respect of all periods asa Member after 16 October, 1964. The whole annual contribution is anallowable deduction for income tax and surtax purposes.10. Exchequer contributions. The Exchequer contributes to the fund inthe following two ways:(a) an amount equal to the total contributed by Members;(b) an additional sum, at present set at  132,000 per year for 25 years to 1989, to meet the cost of crediting back service before 16 October,1964.11. Transferability. Powers are provided to receive into the Members&apos;Pension Fund transfer value payments from other superannuation schemesor funds when a Member enters the fund, and for transfer value payments to be paid to such schemes or funds when a Member ceases to be a Memberof the House.12. Trustees. The Pension Scheme is under the control and management of seven Trustees appointed by Order of the House of Commons, six ofwhom are Members, and the seventh, the Custodian Trustee, is the public trustee or a Trust Corporation.13. Actuarial provisions. The Government Actuary performs thefunctions of actuary to the fund which embraces a quinquennial assessment of the general financial position of the fund (which has to include the adequacy of the initial deficiency contribution), and the calculation of transfer value payments to other schemes and of credit given for similarpayments when received from other schemes. After each quinquennialassessment the Government Actuary publishes a report which is laid before
the House of Commons. The report includes a valuation of the assets andhahilities of the fund and an assessment of the adequacy of the contributionrate in relation to the benefits, and makes recommendations about the futureoperation of the scheme.II.  House of Commons Members&apos; Fund14. The Members&apos; Fund was set up on 28 July, 1939, by the House ofCommons Members&apos; Fund Act 1939. It is a quasi-benevolent fund, not apension scheme, and it is administered by six trustees who are Members ofParliament appointed from all political parties. The fund is governed bythe 1939 Act and further Acts which were passed in 1948, 1957 and 1962.Its income is derived from a statutory deduction from every Member&apos;s salary of  24 a year, an Exchequer grant of up to  22,000 a year and dividendsfrom investments. Grants from the fund are made to ex-Members andtheir widows and children in cases of special hardship. The usualqualifications and grants are as follows:Qualifications(i) The Member has completed 10 years&apos; service (save in very specialcircumstances) and(ii) is over 60 years of age or is permanently medically unfit for work.Grants to MembersUp to  600 a year provided the total income of the applicant, withthe grant, does not exceed  850 a year.Grants to WidowsUp to  360 a year provided the total income of the applicant, withthe grant, does not exceed  610 a year.Having regard to length of service and need, the Trustees may makelarger payments not exceeding  1,080 to Members and  540 to widowssubject to total income limits of  1,330 and  790 respectively.Grants to children up to and including 15 years of ageWhere both parents are dead:one child:  100 a year,two or more:  75 a year each.Where one parent is living:one child:  50 a year,two or more:  50 for the eldest and  30 for the others.In order to arrive at the private income of the applicant all assets are valued,receipts from investments being assessed at the gross value before incometax has been deducted; property is also assessed on a yearly income basis.15. Since the introduction in 1965 of the House of Commons Members&apos;Contributory Pension Scheme, which included provision for up to 10 years&apos;service prior to 16 October, 1964 to reckon for pension purposes entirelyat the Exchequer^ expense, the extent of the Members&apos; Fund&apos;s activity has gradually declined.   Consequently the ceiling figure of  22,000 to the
Exchequers subvention has not been fully taken up since 1968-69 &apos; andforward estimates have been based on the assumption of a continuingrundown from the  15,000 drawn in 1969-70. The Members&apos; Fund nowconcentrates its attention on former M Ps (or their dependants) who are not otherwise eligible for pensions from the contributory pension scheme or whose benefits from the latter scheme may be somewhat less than theirexpectations from the Members&apos; Fund (subject, of course, to the normaltotal income limits), as well as providing exceptional grants in cases ofspecial hardship and assisting any former M P in difficulty over the age of 60but before reaching the qualifying age of 65 for his contributory pension.
OUTLINE OF REVISED PARLIAMENTARY PENSION scheme. Establishment. The revised scheme should begin as from the day onwhich the salaries of the Members of the new House of Commons electedin 1970 are increased.2. Membership of the scheme. All persons who were Members of theHouse of Commons or were Ministers or other paid office-holders on the inception of the scheme, and all persons who become Members, Ministers orpaid office-holders thereafter should participate in the scheme. Participationshould be compulsory in respect of service as a Member of the House ofCommons, but optional by contracting out on taking office, in respect ofservice as a Minister or paid office-holder.3. Qualification and reckonable service. The normal minimumpensionable age should be 65, but an early retirement option should beavailable from 60 onwards on an actuarially reduced pension basis.Members of the scheme with four or more years reckonable service shouldqualify for benefit. A pension should cease to be payable to any formermember of the scheme who re-enters the House as a Member of Parliament,or is appointed a Minister or paid office-holder. All service after 16 October,1964, should be reckonable, and service immediately prior to this date upto a maximum of 10 years should continue to be reckonable without extracontribution by the Member. Service in respect of which a Member&apos;scontributions have been refunded (see paragraph 12 below), or in respectof which the Member&apos;s accrued pension rights have been transferred toanother scheme, should not be reckonable. Service should be reckonableon the basis of completed days.4. Pensions for Members of Parliament. The pension payable to members of Parliament should be l/60th of final salary, averaged over thelast 12 months of service, for each year of reckonable service.5. Pensions for Ministers and other paid office-holders. In addition totheir continuing membership of the Member of Parliament^ pension schemeMinisters and other paid office-holders should receive an additional pension on the basis of l/60th of the final salary (averaged over the last 12 monthsof service) payable to a Member of the House of Commons at the date of retirement multiplied by the ratio which the difference between the Minister^or office-holder&apos;s total emoluments (including his Parliamentary salary) andthe full salary paid to a Member of Parliament bears to the latter for eachyear of Ministerial or official service. In the case of Ministers and otherpaid office-holders who are not Members of the House of Commons the pension should be l/60th of the final salary (averaged over the last12 months of service) payable to a Member of the House of Commons atthe date of retirement, multiplied by the ratio which his Ministerial orofficial salary bears to the full salary paid to a Member of Parliament foreach year of Ministerial or official service.
6. Commutation. There should be provision for an option to commutefor cash up to that proportion of any pension payable which is sufficient to yield a lump sum equivalent to 3/80ths of final salary appropriately adjustedwhere necessary to take account of additional earnings in respect of ministerial and official service, for each year of reckonable service.7. Pensions increase. There should be provision for the future value ofpensions paid to be maintained for rises in the cost of living by biennialreview.8. Widows&apos; pension. The widow (or dependent widower) of a member or former member of the scheme who had completed at least 12 months&apos;reckonable service should receive a pension at the rate of one-half of herlate husband&apos;s actual pension or of his accrued pension rights on the dayof his death. Widows should not be given the option to commute any portion. Widows&apos; pensions should be payable for life but should cease onre-marriage or co-habitation.9. Children&apos;s pension. A pension should be payable in respect of eachdependent child under the age of 16, up to a maximum of four, of a deceasedmember of the scheme, who had completed four or more years reckonableservice at the rate of one-eighth of the member&apos;s pension or pension entitlement. If no widow&apos;s pension is payable, the children&apos;s pension shouldbe increased by a further one-eighth for each child, subject to a maximum ofone-half the member&apos;s pension or pension entitlement. Payment shouldcontinue for each child up to his 22nd birthday or the date on which heceases full-time education, whichever is the earlier.10. Death-in-service benefit. A lump sum equivalent to 12 months&apos;pay or the aggregate of contributions the member has paid, accumulated with interest at 3 per cent per annum, whichever is the greater, should be payable to the legal personal representative of a serving member of the scheme whohas completed four or more years reckonable service on the date of his death.11. Contributions. Contributions payable by members of the scheme should be limited to a maximum of three-eighths of the total cost, theExchequer making up the deficiency.12. Refund of contributions on ceasing to be a member of the scheme.Members of the scheme who have not completed four years reckonableservice or attained the age of 26 should be entitled on ceasing to be amember of the scheme to a refund, of their contributions accumulated with interest at 3 per cent a year. Those members of the scheme who have completed four or more years reekonable service on ceasing to be membersof the scheme should qualify for preserved pension rights and not be eligible for a refund of contributions.13. Death-after-retirement benefit. On the death of a former memberwho retired from the scheme at or after the normal retiring age, if no widow,dependent widower or children survive him, there should be payable to hislegal personal representative the balance of a lump sum equivalent to.12 months&apos; pay at the rate which the former member was receiving prior toretirement, or the former member&apos;s contributions, accumulated with interest at 3i,per cent per annum, whichever is the greater, after deducting the totalof pension payments, if any, received&quot; since retirement.
