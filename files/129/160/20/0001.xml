\V&apos;:     &apos;:&quot;V i&apos;;&apos;-&apos;:.PAYMENT OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT DURING periods of TEMPORARY SUSPENSION FROM WORKMemorandum by the Secretary of State  for Social  service as my colleagues will know from our recent discussion aboutshare  fishermen  (HS(71)11th Meeting),   I  have made acommencement order bringing  into operation from 1  Januarya rule which will  stop  the payment  of  flat-rate unemploymentbenefit  for the first  six days of any period of   temporary suspension  from work.2.       I made the order  in May,  after consultation with theSecretary of State for Employment  and the Secretary of Statefor Trade and  Industry.    Since  then I have receivedrepresentations from many quarters,  including  the TUC,  againstthe  rule.     In particular,  both sides  of  the  textile  industry have urged me  to exempt  textile workers  on the grounds thatshort-time working  is a more or less  permanent  feature of  theindustry,  and  that  the employers  cannot  afford  in presentconditions  of   trade  to agree  to the guaranteed week payments which I  have suggested as  the way out when unemploymentbenefit   is withdrawn.     I am told that  the employers and theunions are now in dispute over this question,   their firstdispute  for a very long time.3.       In dealing with such  representations  I have hithertoheld  firmly to  the  line  that  the  rule must come  into operation in order to bring  to an end an unjustifiable  subsidy to ailing1
industries out  of  the National   Insurance Fund, which was not of  course set up for that  purpose.    From my Departmentalpoint  of view this  is  still  the  right course.    At present levels of  short   time working  the net  saving on benefitexpenditure would be at  the rate  of   6 million a year;   therewould also be a  saving of about   300 staff  in the Departmentof Employment.    But  I  think I  ought  to confirm with mycolleagues  that   they see no objection to my bringing  thenew rule  into operation on 1   January as  planned in the  lightof   the current unemployment and  industrial   situation,particularly  in  the  textile  industry.4.       If  there were  to be a. concession,  difficulties  of definition would make  it  impracticable  to confine  it   to the textile  industry:   I  should have  to make an order  (whichwould not be  subject either to affirmative or negative resolution)   revoking  the commencement  order entirely.     Itwould be possible  thereafter  to make a new commencement orderoperating from a later date whenever it was consideredappropriate  to do  so.     If  the commencement order were  tobe  revoked  it would,   of course,   be unnecessary at  this juncture  to consult  the National   Insurance AdvisoryCommittee about   the exemption of  share  fishermen.5. I invite my colleages to decide whether the commencementorder should stand.KJDepartment of Health and Social security london SE13 December 19712
