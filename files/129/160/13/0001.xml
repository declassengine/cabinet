DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 148 COPY NO    632 December 1971CABINETTHE DEVELOPMENT OF GOVERNMENT organisation memorandum by the Prime Minister1. I am circulating for the information of the Cabinet the attached paper by the Civil Service Department which draws together the thought which has been given since the Government took office to the correct organisation of work within Government Departments, andpoints to certain general conclusions.    It also indicates the mainlines on which further work might be carried on in individual cases.2. I have endorsed the general conclusions in this paper, and i hope that my colleagues will bear them in mind and be guided by themin considering organisational issues within their Department.E H10 Downing Street2 December 1971
annex the DEVELOPMENT 03? GOVERNMENT ORGANISATIONPaper by the Civil Service DepartmentINTRODUCTION1.     This paper considers how to carry forward the development ofgovernment organisation in the areas which have hitherto been coveredby the words &quot;hiving off&quot;, &quot;accountable management&quot; and &quot;account a-bility&quot;.   It introduces a new term - &quot;Departmental Agency&quot; - to which reference will be made later.2,     First, some definitions:a. Hiving off is discussed in the Pulton Report under the heading of &quot;The Delegation of Responsibility to AutonomousPublic Boards&quot;.    Paragraphs 188-191 of the Report are relevant.As the Report rightly pointed out at paragraph 190, hiving offwas outside their terms of reference and they did not make any detailed study either of the concept or of particular cases.a working definition might be:-&quot;A process whereby a current activity for which ministers are fully answerable to Parliament, carried out at theirdirection by civil servants, financed directly from Votes,within the departmental framework, is either transferredto an autonomous public body not staffed by civil servants,and not financed directly from Votes, for whose actionsMinisters are not fully answerable to Parliament, or is removed from the public sector altogether&quot;.b. Accountable Management.   The Pulton Committee definedaccountable management at paragraph 150 of their Report in theterms set out below:-&quot;Accountable management means holding individuals and unitsresponsible for performance measured as objectively aspossible.   Its achievement depends upon identifying orestablishing accountable units within governmentdepartments - units where output can be measured againstcosts or other criteria, and where individuals can beheld personally responsible for their performance.&quot;c. Accountability   (which is a wider concept than accountablemanagement which it embraces) can cover both internal and external relationships,   Por internal accountability a neatdefinition would be:--&quot;The obligation to answer for the exercise of delegatedauthority.&quot;1
3.     The Pulton Committee (see particularly paragraphs 188-19.1) sawroom for hiving off some existing work from central government toautonomous public boards.   These boards would be wholly responsiblefor the powers delegated to them and outside the day to day controlof Ministers and the scrutiny of Parliament.   They drew attention to commercial and non-commercial activities already in this state.    TheCommittee did not make the detailed study they saw as being necessaryto identify individual cases and they accepted that difficultparliamentary and constitutional issues and related questions ofmachinery of government were involved; they left in the air thesuggestion that accountable management would be most effective inhived off organisations but also indicated that some of the benefits of hiving off might be achieved inside government if responsibility and authority were allocated more clearly.4.     A major development in the last few years has been theestablishment of very large departments.   These have brought with thempressures which can be lessened by delegation of authority (whetherexternal or internal) and by the clarification of organisationalresponsibility including specifically questions of accountabilityand accountable management.5.     The present Government has laid particular emphasis on its aim off &quot;less Government&quot; which embraces not only less Government inabsolute terms but also less Government in terms of central activity and government from the centre.    In addition emphasis has been puton the need for better management and greater efficiency and theGovernment is committed to a coherent approach to the organisationof Government work whereby &quot;executive blocks of work [in the largedepartments] will be delegated to accountable units of managementthus lessening the load on the departmental top management&quot;.    (white paper on The Reorganisation of Central Government, &quot;Cmnd 4506,October 1970, paragraph 14&quot;.)Hiving Off6,     Much work has gone into the possibilities of hiving off.   Somehiving off has been accomplished already.   The pressure on CivilService manpower has provided a spur but no-one would argue that thisshould be a determining factor except perhaps when other argumentswere equal or nearly so.   The essence of hiving off is the transfer from a Government Department to an autonomous body.   The status of thestaff derives from the status of the employer.   Por the determiningfactors it is necessary to look elsewhere.   A number of critical areas have been identified as important in relation to hiving off:a. the extent to which activities are, or can be made, whollyor largely self-financing;b. the degree to which activities offer, or can be given,quantitative measures of performance;c. the extent to which activities involve the skills of theentrepreneur and the stimulus of competition;d. the articulation, and responsiveness, of operational work to developing Ministerial policy and the consequences for autonomy;2
e. the viability of an organisation in terms of personnel management including, for example, recruitment, quality, careerdevelopment, training, mobility, and conditions of service;f. the degree of discretionary authority involved particularlyin relation to the liberty and economic activity of the individualcitizen, together with the question of redress;g. the extent to which the activities require Ministers to answer direct to Parliament and the public;h. the scale of disturbance in relation both to activities and personnel.7.     The staff of a hived off body will not be civil servants.   Ifa hived off body is largely or wholly financially self-supporting andits level and quality of output determined by the price mechanismthere will be no need for the Government to exercise detailed controlover it pay and grading policies in the long term, although the factthat its staff will initially come from the Civil Service and thatany changes in conditions will have to be negotiated with theirrepresentatives will probably ensure that total departure from CivilService terms will take place over a period of time.   The staffconcerned will resent ceasing to be civil servants which is inevitablylikely to cause a difficult transitional period.   They will also have to make their career within the hived off body and there will normally be no arrangements for transfer between the body and the restof the Civil Service.8.     But the separation of activities from Ministerial control and the ending or major restriction of Ministerial accountability which areat the heart of hiving off restrict its application.   The obviouscandidates are those where there is little or no discretionary element(which calls for accountability) or where the activities are whollyor largely financially self supporting and of a commercial naturewhere Ministerial control is inappropriate.Departmental Agencies9.     In consequence, there are very large areas of Government activitywhich are unsuitable for hiving off.   The issue therefore arises asto the ways in which improvements can be secured in the operational and managerial structure within the existing broad departmentalframework.   This needs to be considered within the context of theexistence of very large departments; of the &quot;efficiency&quot; arguments advanced in support of hiving off and autonomy; of the desirabilityof accountability and accountable management and of the Government&apos;saims of &quot;better government&quot; and &quot;more accountable government&quot; coupled with &quot;less government&quot;.   The aim must be to secure as many as possible of the benefits claimed for hiving off for those activities and services which are the direct responsibility of Ministers3
10.   For these areas it is proposed to use the generic term&quot;Departmental Agency&quot;.     This is not entirely satisfactory andit is clear that the characteristics of such an Agency shoulddiffer according to the requirements of particular Departments.A working definition could be:-&quot;A departmental agency is an organisational entity, under itsown executive head, either part of a government department ora corporate body within the departmental framework, acting atthe direction of a Minister who is answerable to parliament for its activities, and staffed by civil servants (as atpresent defined) but distinguished from the conventionalpattern of departmental organisation by having its ownexecutive head, and accounting officer, and by a large degreeof freedom in staff management.&quot;The definition does not preclude the possibility of importingfrom outside the civil service people with particular skills to fill posts, as temporary civil servants, including the most seniorones, in such organisations.11.   A number of existing functions within the departmentalframework can already be regarded to a greater or lesser degree,as being within this definition.    The degree of organisationalseparation and managerial autonomy in the Civil Service Commission,the ECGD and others are examples.     The Procurement Executive inthe Ministry of Defence is a more recent example and work is going on in other departments on similar lines.     A good many activities which are at present organised on a more conventional pattern within their Departments can be given a more distinct and more appropriatepattern of organisation and style of management while remaining underultimate Ministerial control and within the Civil Service.     Thescale and nature of each activity will determine the extent to whichit is a bureau or office within its parent Department - visiblydistinct from other parts of the organisation, but clearly within it -and the extent to which it has, like the Civil Service Commission, a formal existence in its own right as a corporate entity - thoughstill under the control and within the field of responsibility ofthe Minister in charge of the relevant policy department.     the precise pattern of accountability and control will have to be derivedfrom the circumstances of each case, but in each case with theintention of giving management the requisite degree of managerialfreedom and authority to match the extent to which they can be heldaccountable.12.   The rationale of seeking enhanced management efficiency in thisway finds its real justification in the new departmental framework,with a much smaller number of large departments each carrying respon-sibility for a unified field of policy.     There is potential benefitto the activity itself, to the closer identification of staff witha recognisable group whilst remaining part of a larger &quot;family&quot;, andto the parent department in terms of relief from the day to day management responsibility for sizeable blocks of work with limiteddirect policy content or Ministerial involvement.     This was speltout as a necessary feature of the new framework in the White Paper&quot;The Reorganisation of Central Government&quot; as part of a coherentapproach to the organisation of Government work.
Characteristics of a Departmental Agency13.   A reasonable, descriptive approximation for such a combination of separate organisational identity and substantialmanagerial autonomy might be &quot;Departmental/Executive Agency&quot; whichwould be within government.     It would be characterised, in broadterms, as followsi. It would have an executive head, responsible directly or indirectly to the Minister in charge of the Departmentwhose policy the agency executes or applies.ii. This executive head would, where the scale and natureof the activity is appropriate, be the accounting officerfor the agency - in other cases a number of agencies mightbe brigaded together under a single accounting officer,(Accounting Officers would not normally be below deputy secretary rank.)iii. Importantly, the departmental agency would have a large measure of control over its own staff.As the staff concerned would remain civil servants,departmental agencies would remain subject to pay and gradingcontrol in the same way as the rest of the Civil Service.Similarly they would have to follow personnel management practices which were consistent with general Civil Service policy but with discretion over a wide field to adapt policy to suit their owncircumstances.     There is at present considerable variation indetail between personnel practices and organisation in different departments and this flexibility of approach which already existswould seem capable of meeting all the reasonable requirements of departmental agencies.     There would be a distinct relationship between these agencies and the Civil Service Department in personnel matters though the nature of it would vary according to particular cases as, of course, would that of an agency forming part of a large department with the Permanent Secretary of that department who would have a pervasive role in relation to topmanagement of the Agency and probably certain co-ordinatingfunctions as well.15.   Since the agencies would remain part of Government some formof control over their use of manpower and other resources would benecessary.     This could vary from the maintenance of the presentstatus quo at one end, through relaxations perhaps by referenceto performance indicators or financial budgets which offer a degreeof choice between different resources, to full freedom based on a fully fledged system of accountable management.Future Development16.    It can be argued that some of the Civil Service is alreadyorganised along the lines described.     This is true.     But thereis a good deal to be said for further development.     It provides aflexible Management structure, offers a significant measure of autonomy, allows personnel management to have both the benefits ofcentralisation and decentralisation, and should stimulate both
accountability and accountable management with increased emphasis on personal responsibility not least within very large departmentswhere the load carried by top management is very heavy.   There is noreason why departmental agencies should not have within them ares which are accountable units of management operating, for example, onthe basis of a trading fund.   In addition there are presentationaladvantages and it would no dount be helpful to emphasize the degreeof self-sufficiency and autonomy,17,   Any scheme of organisational types drawn up to span all thevarious types of Government activities is bound to be incomplete.There is a wide variety of organisational forms and patterns.   Indeedthere is a spectrum running from the private sector enterprise,completely free of government control, to the conventional Ministerialheaded government department.   Between these two extremes there isa limitless number of forms of organisation.   So instead of attemptingan elaborate classification this paper concentrates on the differencebetween activities close to, but outside, the framework of governmentdepartments and activities necessarily within that framework but where there can be a measure of autonomy, particularly in areas which do not demand day to day Ministerial involvement over a wide variety of issues,18,   Against this background it is suggested that the tests to beapplied, in broad terms, are as follows:-i. Hiving offActivities which are, or can be made, commercial to sucha degree that the organisation could be wholly or largelyfinancially self-supporting and its level and quality of output determined by the price mechanism or some other form of performance measurement.   There should be little or no policymaking component and little or no significant discretionaryauthority vested directly in the body concerned, which couldaffect the liberty or economic activity of the citizen exceptin a minimal way.   (A qualification might be that a government subsidy to the body to carry out some particular limitedactivity which would not otherwise be financially viable shouldnot disqualify the body in general from this test,)All those which satisfy these tests are candidates forhiving off.   Hiving off involves transfer outside government.The actual organisation would vary from case to case.   It couldvary from outright transfer or the sale of the concern to theprivate sector, or the cessation of government activity withthe private sector being left to fulfil any residual need, tothe establishment of public sector bodies initially financed byloan from government and in receipt of a continuing government subsidy for a limited part of their activity,ii. Departmental Agenciesa, Activities which have a large management content, or arequasi-commercial or market-oriented, preferably with some measure of performance or some revenue earning capacity even within Government,   Such activities could make a contribution6
to policy making or exercise elements of discretion but onlyin fields of secondary importance to the citizen, requiringonly a minimal degree of Ministerial answerability.This category is necessary ill-defined.   It is part of the concept of executive agencies outlined in this paper that theactivities, and the agencies to carry them out, are such as toremain part of government.   Indeed, the scale of many of these activities may be too small to justify the creation of aseparate body.   They could remain wholly within the parentgovernment department as small accountable units or units witha very clear degree of accountability.   It is their potentialsuitability for the introduction of accountable management, the degree of accountability and the extent of remoteness from theneed for day to day Ministerial involvement, which marks offthis group of activities as suitable for executive agencies,b.     Activities and blocks of work involving the applicationof Ministerial policy - typically,, the application of codes orrules without day to day Ministerial intervention but with anappeal procedure.   Cases with discretionary elements in theapplication if those rules ensure that a requirement for ministerial answerability remains an important feature,A large part of the activity of government falls intothis class, and much of it is already organised in executiveagencies of this variety.   Large parts of the Revenue Depart-ments are examples of this type of activity in their application of the tax laws.   The same concept might be oralready has been extended to other areas of government work suchas the payment of social security benefits, the operation of the prison system, and the like.Conclusion19,   If this approach is agreed, the next stage will beffordepartments to identify and agree on candidates for these categories,with follow-up work on clarification of accountability arid on theintroduction of accountable management.   The important point isthat no single form of organisation is held out as appropriate forall cases.    There will have to be variations according to thecircumstances of each case, but the common thread is the continuingimportance that must be attached to allocating responsibility and authority as clearly as possible.
