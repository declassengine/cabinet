CP(71) 156 COPY NO     g 20 December, 1971CABINETRESTRICTIVE PRACTICES IN THE SUPPLY of professional services memorandum by the Secretary of State for trade and industry. This paper sets out my proposals for extending to professionalservices the legislation on restrictive practices.    The Economic PolicyCommittee have agreed that the legislation should be extended to commercial services; but opinion is divided on extension to professionalservices.MONOPOLIES COMMISSION REPORT ON PROFESSIONAL services .        In 1970 the Monopolies Commission concluded that although somerestrictions in the supply of professional services might be occasionallyjustified, those on charges and advertising would not generally be in thepublic interests.    I have since invited the professional associations tore-examine critically their practices in the light of the Commission^findings, but they are in general unwilling to make significant changes.They remain opposed to the Commission^ view that professional services are supplied as business transactions and that restrictive practicesgoverning such transactions must be seen in that light.THE CASE FOR DEALING WITH RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES IN THEPROFESSIONS3. I recognise that some professions - the law, the church andmedicine are the prime examples - differ from other suppliers of services in being expected to maintain certain standards of conduct and competence,and to have a personal fiduciary relationship with their clients which is governed primarily by an ethical code.    They are naturally anxious tomaintain this relationship intact, and my proposals are designed to take it into account - being directed at the economic aspects of professionalpractice.4.        In so far as this involves business transactions using economic resources, restrictive agreements among the practitioners tend todistort competition and to lead to misallocation of resources, and are thuslikely to be against the public interest.    We cannot well ignore theseeffects in preparing a comprehensive Bill to promote competition generally.1flS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
5. The Monopolies Commission recommended that successivereferences of professions which operate restrictive agreements should bemade to them.    They thought that it might eventually be appropriate, inthe light of their investigations, for the legislation dealing with restrictive practices to be amended to cover professional services.    There is noreason in principle to suppose that a judicial procedure would be anyless successful in dealing with services than with goods.    And it seems tome better to take power now to enable certain restrictions in professionalservices to be examined by the Court, because:a. the problems to be dealt with are not those of monopoly oroligopoly as commonly understood, but of concerted restrictive practices by many suppliers;b. the professional bodies seem uhflkely to modify theirpractices voluntarily in the light of further recommendations by the Commission.    Their restrictive agreements could thenbe dealt with only by Order, which would be more controversialthan merely invoking a judicial procedure;c. it would be necessary to refer each profession to theCommission in turn.    But one or two decisions of the court would clearly indicate to other professions where they stood(as resale price maintenance and restrictive agreements in thesupply of goods have been successfully dealt with as a result ofa handful of cases);d. to exclude the professions specifically from that part ofthe Bill which will extend the existing restrictive practiceslegislation to services would give rise to problems of definitionand would be likely to provoke adverse comment from many quarters.PROCEDURE UNDER THE EXTENDED legislation. There would be no question of requiring the wholesale registration of restrictive agreements in the professions.    As a first step, theDirector General of Fair Trading and Competition would discuss with aprofessions&apos; representatives the public interest in relation to its restrictive practices.    Only if the profession proved unwilling to change or abandonpractices that the Director General considered detrimental would he adviseme to make an Order (which would be subject to affirmative resolution)requiring the profession to register its restrictive agreements so that theCourt could examine them.    The Director General would keep in close contact with Departments, and I would of course consult those colleagues with a direct interest before making an Order.2
SCOPE OF THE NEW POWERS7. The definition of relevant restrictions in the 1956 Act would apply mutatis mutandis to services as to goods;  only restrictions onadvertising would need to be added.    The quality of a professional serviceand restrictions on entry into a profession, on forms of entity(e. g. a &quot;partnerships only&quot; rule) and on the carrying on of otherbusinesses would not be covered.    Nor would agreements authorisedunder statute. But the new legislation would cover those restrictionsmost criticised by the Monopolies Commission - including the scale feescharged by accountants, architects and auctioneers (for example), andrestrictions on advertising practised by actuaries, surveyors andconsulting engineers (among others).8.        I see no need to provide additional &quot;gateways&quot; (i. e, grounds forjustifying restrictions to the Court):  that most used by suppliers of goods -namely, that removal of the restriction would deny to the public specificand substantial benefits - would apply equally well to services,including professional services.PRESENTATION9. I accept that these proposals will be unwelcome to manyprofessional bodies.    But I think it would be difficult for these openlyto oppose them, if carefully presented as part of our comprehensivepolicy for enhancing competition in every sector of the economy, with dueemphasis upon the selective approach and the safeguards referred to above.10.      I seek my colleagues&apos; agreement to arrange for the necessary powers to be included in the Bill now in preparation.J d department of Trade and Industry20 December 1971
