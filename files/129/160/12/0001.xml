DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 147 COPY NO        g31 December 1971CABINETTRADE UNION ATTITUDES TO THE implementation of THE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS act memorandum by the Secretary of State for employment. I was invited to circulate for the information of the Cabinet anote appraising the current attitudes of the Trades Union Congress (TUC)to the implementation of the Industrial Relations Act (CM(71) 56thConclusions, Minute 4).2. At the present time, only certain parts of the Act have beenbrought into force.    These include the provisions enabling unions andemployers1 organisations to register with the Chief Registrar;  andthose provisions establishing the Commission on Industrial Relations (CIR)as a statutory body.    On 1 December, however, further major parts ofthe Act will become operative.    These include, notably, the Qfifts-blishmentof the National Industrial Relations Court (NIRC);  the provisions onenforceable collective agreements and trade union recognition;  and theemergency procedures.    I envisage that those parts of the Act extending the rights of individual employees - the right to belong to a trade union ornot to do so;  safeguards against unfair dismissal; and the right of appeal by union members against unfair union practices - should come into forcein the early part of next year (probably 1 February/1 March).3.        Since the bulk of the Act is not yet in force, it is premature to assess how far the attitudes and policy of the TUC and its affiliated unionswill impede the reforms introduced by the Act.   So far the tuc&apos;s strategyis to attempt to make the Act ineffective by:-a. boycotting the institutions established by the Act.    Thismeans refusal of union officials to serve on the NIRC, CIR andIndustrial Tribunals;  and a refusal by affiliated unions to use the new machinery;b. refusing to register - or more accurately in most casesdeciding to withdraw from the register;1
c. insisting on the inclusion in all collective agreements ofa clause disclaiming the intention to make the agreement legally binding;    and d. putting pressure on employers to disregard the Act and carry on &quot;business as usual&quot; as though the Act did not exist.4.        Although there are certainly some affiliated unions (particularly among those recruiting white-collar workers) which have expressedmisgivings about certain aspects of the tuc&apos;s policy towards the Act,there is no sign at present of any significant move to &quot;break ranks&quot; onthe part of a major affiliated union;  and no important unions leaders atpresent seem prepared to disassociate themselves publicly from TUCpolicy.    A substantial number of unions have already, in accordancewith TUC policy, withdrawn from the register;  and only a email handfulhave made public their intention to seek registration or remain on theregister.    Nonetheless, some important unions are evidently in nohurry to de-register;  and others have been advised by the ChiefRegistrar that, under their present rules, they may not lawfully withdraw from the registex-.    In short, a decision about whether or not to registerhas not been, or cannot be, reached by a number of sizeable unions.The Appendix attached summarises the present position.5. I have no doubt that it will be some while before trade unionsaffiliated to the TUC are prepared to adopt a more pragmatic, realisticor opportunistic approach to the Act.    This is disappointing; butscarcely unexpected.    The length of the period before there is a &quot;thaw&quot;in trade union attitudes will depend, to a considerable extent, on theposition taken by the major white-collar unions - several of whom may wish to find an excuse to register and to use the Act in order to protectand defend themselves against the challenge from non-affiliated tradeunions.    It is by no means unlikely that such challenges will be made insuch industries as barking and insurance, in local government, and in thepost office.    This may force the hand of unions such as the Associationo  Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs (ASTMS), the national association of Local Government Officers (NALGO) and the Union of PostOffice Workers (UPOW) and others, and thereby start a chain reactionwhich would certainly not be limited to the white-collar sector.    Ingeneral, however, I believe that any overt attempts by the government or by employers to exploit the provisions of the Act as a means ofembarrassing or weakening trade unions will be more likely to hardenthan to soften trade union opposition.6. Despite trade union opposition to the Act - or in some casesbecause of it - there is a great deal of evidence that employers are takingthe Act very seriously, and are fundamentally reviewing existing procedure-ures in the light of its provisions.    This activity and re-thinking on thepart of employers should have the effect both of bringing about more rapidly reforms in industrial relations and also of forcing the tradeunions to face up to the need for change.    For this reason, among others,it is far from true to say that the trade unions will, through their policyof non-co-operation, prevent the implementation or nullify the effects ofthe Act.R department of Employment30 November 1971 2
