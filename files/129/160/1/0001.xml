secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(71) 136 COPY NO    6215 November 1971CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE TO 1975-76:DRAFT WHITE paper memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer.        Attached is the draft of this year&apos;s annual Public expenditure white Paper as prepared under the guidance of the Chief Secretary and agreed in detail between Departments at official level.PROCEDURE AND TIMING2. The standard Parliamentary procedure is for this White paper to be laid and, after a full clear week, to be debated for two days, oneof them a Supply day.    The Civil Vote on Account for the coming financial year is taken at the same time;  since it precedes thepreparation of new Estimates, it is now only a formal document basedon the current year&apos;s Estimates.    The business of the House is being planned on the basis that the two-day debate will be in the week beginning 6th December.    This means that the White Paper should bepublished not later than Thursday, 25 November.PRESENTATION3. In my view we should seek to minimise the extent to which thetwo-day debate may be used to debate the five year prospect for the economy generally rather than for public expenditure.    For thisreason the draft contains only those references to its economic seetingthat are essential for the justification of our decisions to make substantialadditions to the programmes of the previous White Paper (Cmnd. 4578)published in January last:   in particular -i. the desirability of the expenditures we have added inorder to create or maintain employment in the years immediately ahead;  and ii.       the scope for the increases we have made in social service and other programmes right through theperiod, within our general policy that the share ofnational output which is absorbed by public expenditure should, at least, not increase.
secret. Similarly, I consider that we should encourage the expenditure committee to improve their grasp of the issues involved in the public expenditure programmes, but discourage them from concerning themselvewith how to run the economy.    On this basis, the draft meets as many aspossible of the specific recommendations of the Expenditure Committee(Third Report - HC 549) about the form in which they would like thepublic expenditure material to be presented in these White Papers.Moreover, as the annex to this memorandum shows, the draft virtuallyremoves the ground of. the attack on last year&apos;s White Paper that was most difficult to handle, namely, that we discontinued the projections ofrevenue, though critics who want revenue figures for their own sake will no doubt continue to complain.    I regard what is now being provided onthe economic background as sufficient and I do not propose to offer theExpenditure Committee in this White Paper or in speeches to parliament or in separate evidence any quantitative forecasts of the shape of the economy five years ahead.conclusion. I invite my colleagues to agee to publication of the attached white paper, subject to final drafting improvements and final consultation withthe Lord President on the timing of its publication and of the two-daydebate.A treasury Chambers15 November 19712SECRET

PART public Expenditure General ReviewDevelopments since Cmnd 4578In the period since January, when the Government published their, firstfull public expenditure programmes in the previous White Paper in thisseries,!1) new needs have been identified by their continuing reviews of the longer term programmes: they have increased the provision for the health service, for the personal social services, and for the building of schools and colleges; for investment by the British Steel Corporation; for the fighting strength of the Services; and for local authorities&apos; lending for house purchase. Other additional provision not previously quantifiable arises from the further development of particular Government policies; for example,for the improvement of social security benefits and for joining the european communities.2. New needs have also arisen from the course of events, including therise in unemployment, particularly in the Development Areas, and the collapse of Rolls-Royce. Some of the resulting calls for expenditure relate to theimmediate future and only for two years or so ahead, such as the specialprogrammes of investment in the infrastructure of the Development Areas,and the enlarged grants for improving houses in those areas; or, over a ratherlonger period, the expanded naval shipbuilding programme. Others are for continuing expenditure, such as finance for the RB 211 engine.3. The status of the programmes in this White Paper is the same asin Cmnd 4578; they are liable to be affected at any time, by continuingexamination of policies and of their suitability for the situation with whichthey have to deal.4. In the normal way if there is a modification of policy it would beexpected to have its greatest impact in the latter half of the period. Thefigures for those years are in any case both more flexible and more imprecise,except where the expenditure is wholly determined by decisions which arethose of Government and are not qualified as provisional.5. In the present situation, however, the most urgent and some of thelargest additions to the programmes affect the first half of the period; inparticular, those undertaken in order to mitigate the hardship and waste ofunemployment in the Development Areas. Further expenditure of this kindmay be added as a result of the Governments continuing examination,already announced, of the scope for bringing forward more capital expendi-ture on certain programmes. There is no question here of other needs com-competing for resources; only of using productive power which would otherwise be idle.6. Activity in the economy has been lower than foreseen when Cmnd4578 was published. On this account tax reductions now totalling  1,400million in a full year have been made and in addition there is scope for a more rapid increase in public expenditure this year and next than was envisaged in Cmnd 4578. The programmes of this White Paper areframed accordingly, and while the increases in the succeeding years are rela-tively smaller than in Cmnd 4578 they begin from a higher level,(1) &quot;Public Expenditure 1969-70 to 1974-75&quot; - Cmnd 4578.B
7. The demand on output which results from public expenditure pro-grammes is not accurately measured by the money expenditures; different forms of expenditure have different demand effects, and these may vary indifferent circumstances. As well as close analysis, a degree of judgment istherefore required to assess the implications of the programmes in terms of demand. Any measurement produced in this way is subject to reservations, buton this basis the estimated average annual rate of increase in net demand on output between 1971-72 and 1975-76 implied by the programmes of this white Paper is about 2.5 per cent in real terms.(2) When allowance is madefor public sector prices to move during the period relatively to those of the economy as a whole, as may be expected from the evidence of the past, this represents an average annual rate of increase in real cost to the economy ofabout 3.2 per cent.(2)8. Such a rate is close to that of the productive potential of the economyover the past decade and more, which has been around 3 per cent a year.But a projection of this trend will understate the future growth in resources.First, there is the increase in output that will result from the taking up of sparecapacity. Second, there is the likelihood that some of the recent improvementin productivity will prove permanent. The Government, however, whilstallowing the absolute level of the public expenditure programmes to increasethroughout the period, have held the rate of growth of their real cost to the economy in that period close to 3 per cent so as not to produce excessivepressure of demand when resources are fully employed again.9. Policies will continue to be reviewed, for the better direction ofexpenditure to needs, including those of the areas where unemployment is so high, as well as those of more general kinds; and changes in the programmesmay yet be made for these reasons, producing net increases or decreases inthe totals, if in the developing situation the Government judge them to berequired.The changes in the programmes10. Chart 1 shows the size of groups of programmes in this White paper and in Cmnd 4578, and their rates of change. Chart 2 shows how the addi-tions which have been made since Cmnd 4578 fall into two broad groupings,those with their main impact in the short term and those representing addi-tions continuing into the longer term.O The main components are shown in Table 3.1, page ??, and an illustrativeaccount of what is involved in making calculations of this kind is being submitted in a treasury Memorandum of Evidence to the General Sub Committee of the^expenditure committee.

The pattern of the resulting programmes compared with those of cmnd 4578 is shown in Table 1.1, which shows the distribution of expendi-ture between broad groups of programmes and the rates of increase from yearto year in total expenditure.16. Table 1.1 expresses the programmes at constant (1971 Survey) prices.This provides a measure of the year to year changes in the volume of goods and services used in each programme or, in the case of transfer payments,in claims on goods and services. Changes expressed in this White paper in these terms are described as being &quot; in volume terms &quot;.171 The table shows that the average annual rates of increase in totalexpenditure in volume terms between 1971-72 and 1974-75 is 2.1 per cent inthis White Paper, compared with 2.2 per cent in Cmnd 4578. Looking forward to 1975-76, the average annual rate of increase of this White Paper&apos;s pro-grammes is 2.0 per cent.18. When the programmes are expressed at constant prices including therelative price effect a measure is given of the year to year change in their real cost, but one which (in contrast to that quoted in paragraph 7 for public expenditure as a whole) does not take account of changes over the period in the composition of these programmes which alter their effect on demand.Changes expressed in this White Paper in these terms are described as being&quot; in cost terms&quot;. In this form the comparison between the total programmes of the two White Papers is as follows:

The programmes are shown in the tables in this part of the white paper net of charges. The estimated receipts from charges in each programme are set out, as the Select Committee on Expenditure has requested (HC 549,page XI, paragraph 32), in Tables 3.10 to 3.15 on pages ??-??. A numberof items shown as charges were previously treated as other forms of receipts and not netted from expenditure. The principle of this reclassiflcation hasbeen that a charge should be netted from expenditure if there is both a clear and direct link between the payment and the acquisition of specific goods or services, and the level of charge is related to the cost of providing the goodsor services, rather than the charge being used as a revenue raising instrument.The amount of receipts reclassified in this way is between  50 million and
 60 million a year. Among the larger items are those of Government testingstations for goods vehicles, the Public Trustee, the Patent Office, and the LandRegistry, and the Severn and Erskine Bridge tolls.22. Tables 3.10 to 3.15 have been extended also to show, where this ispossible, projections of other receipts which are determined and levied in theadministration of each individual service, and not as elements of fiscal policy.This also is in accordance with views expressed by the Select Committee on expenditure (HC 549, page XII, paragraph 34). The table does not, however,include figures for the gross trading surpluses of the nationalised industries,because of the great uncertainty of any forecast of them.Public expenditure by spending authority distinguishing current and capitalexpenditure: 1971-72 to 1975-76TABLE 1.4  millio	1971-72 estimate	1972-73 estimate	1973-74 estimate	1974-75 estimate	1975-76 estimate	Average annual percentage increase 1971-72 to 1975-76						I.

Table 1.4 summarises the totals of the current and capital expendi-tures of each type of spending authority   the Government, the local authori-
ties, and the public corporations including the nationalised industries   andshows the average annual rates of change over the period separately in volumeand cost terms.(4)24. The estimates of local authorities&apos; current expenditure from 1973-74onwards represent only provisional calculations by the Departments con-cerned, and definitive figures will not become available until they have been negotiated with the local authorities in successive further settlements of rate support grant; the figures in their present form will not necessarily representthe appropriate starting point when the time comes for each round of nego-tiations, since there may by then be considerations to be taken into account which are not at present in the minds of either side. The Government hope,however, that the figures as they stand will serve as a basis for new, closerand continuing discussion with the local authorities&apos; representatives on the programmes. Arrangements are also being discussed with these representatives on procedures for them to be consulted regularly in the preparation of thecapital programmes.25. Subject to this and to the general reservations in paragraphs 3 and 4,the fastest growing element of capital expenditure in the public sector is thatof the Government, including hospitals, roads and prisons; and of current expenditure, that of the local authorities&apos; services generally.Public expenditure in the past26. The estimate for each programme for 1970-71 given in Cmnd 4578 iscompared with the provisional outturn for that year in Table 1.1. The Cmnd4578 estimate is shown to have been about  100 million, or \ per cent, too low. This is more than accounted for by the course of nationalised industries&apos;capital expenditure: Cmnd 4578 envisaged that this would fall short of theaggregate of the individual industries&apos; estimates by  150 million, but expendi-ture by the steel, electricity and coal industries was greater than expected and there was little net shortfall on the nationalised industries&apos; programme as a whole.27. Tables 3.23 and 3.24 on pages 000-000 make a beginning with whatthe Government hope will become a cumulative record of public expenditureactually incurred. The Select Committee on Expenditure (HC 549, page XIX,paragraph 62) made a general recommendation that material should be pro-vided for comparison over a period of five past years. The Government intend to work towards this. But as it is only for the years covered by the previous white Papers in the series that the material is available to explain and inter-pret precisely the year to year movement in the figures, these tables extendback in this White Paper only to 1968-69.(4) The analysis of the individual programmes in these categories is given in Tables3.16 to 3.21 of Part 3, and is extended in Tables 3.22 and 2.23 to distinguish the current and capital components of local authorities&apos; expenditure separately for England and Wales and forScptland.

The figures for the Defence Budget provide for the decision, already announced, to expand four of the &quot;representative infantry companies&quot; tobattalion strength. This policy change will increase the estimates given in cmnd 4578 (revalued to 1971 Survey prices) by  10 million a year to  2,506million in 1972-73,  2,540 million in 1973-74 and  2,557 million in 1974-75.2. The figures make allowance also for the decision to accelerate ship-building orders for the Navy and thereby to provide additional employmentin Development Areas (see Part I, paragraph 11). The additional expenditure will fall mainly in 1972-73 ( 31 million) and 1973-74 ( 32 million).3. The figure for 1975-76 is provisional at this stage. Its adequacy willbe further examined in relation to the planned defence programme.4. Detailed information about the Defence Budget for 1972-73 anddevelopments in defence plans will be reported to Parliament in the 1972Statement on Defence Estimates.OTHER MILITARY DEFENCETABLE 2.2   million	1970-71 Provisional outturn	1971-72 estimate	1972-73 estimate	1973-74 estimate	1974-75 estimate	1975-76 estimate						At 1971 Survey prices Military aid    .........

Military aid. This heading covers military technical assistance which provides forcourses in the United Kingdom for the service personnel of other countries,the provision of British service training teams on loan or secondment to developing (mainly Commonwealth) countries and a small amount of policetraining, particularly in South-East Asia. It also covers the cost of capital equipment to a few countries, although existing commitments of this type are running down.Allied services . The main items are accommodation of the headquarters staff, andsuperannuation for the civilian staff of the Ministry of Defence, and HMSOand COI services (stationery and recruitment publicity) for the Ministry.United States Military Aircraft*3. Final deliveries of aircraft have been completed but payments, financed by United States credits, are still being made in 1971-72 to cover support costs and final settlements. The U.S. credit facilities terminate at 31st March 1972;thereafter any further payments will be met directly from the Defence Budget.OVERSEAS AIDTABLE 2.3   million	1970-71 provisional outturn	1971-72 estimate	1972-73 estimate	1973-74 estimate	1974-75 estimate	1975-76 estimate at 1971 Survey prices a.

The adjustment (line b) represents the difference between the two figures.(a) See Notes on Methodology paragraph 3, page 00.1. The presentation of overseas aid in this White Paper differs fromthat of previous years in that the figures are now shown net of amortisationreceipts from past aid loans and at constant prices, in conformity with the presentation of most other programmes. The aid programme will in future be determined on this net constant price basis, with each annual programmebeing converted to a gross cash sum for the submission of the Estimates toParliament.2.  Overseas aid expenditure covers the total of British official develop-(*) The basis of these figures is described on page 17 of Cmnd 4578.18&apos;
ment assistance provided to developing countries directly or through inter-national organisations. The figures in the table above relate only to economic aid.3. Flows of private funds as well as official aid are expected to make asubstantial contribution to the UNCTAD 1% target which the Governmentlast year undertook at the United Nations to do their best to reach by 1975.Measures to encourage British private investment in developing countries havebeen announced during 1971 (Cmnd 4656). The aid programme for 1972-73 isnow increased by  9 million (at 1971 Survey prices) above the level for thatyear shown in Cmnd 4578. For 1975-76, the increase of 9% over 1974-75 is thesame as the percentage increase for that year over 1973-74.4. In 1972-73 it is expected that, of the gross planning figure (which on the basis of previous experience is higher than the Estimate provision toallow for underspending) about 56 per cent and 15 per cent would be devotedrespectively to bilateral capital and multilateral aid; about 19 per cent to technical assistance, nearly 6 per cent to the CDC, and about 4 per cent to thepensions of former members of the Overseas Services. The allocation of the aid programme for subsequent years is reviewed annually; and the forecasts for even the coming year may be varied in the course of the year. The follow-ing paragraphs are illustrative by reference to 1970.5. The main recipient of British multilateral aid is the international development Association (IDA). Other international institutions receivingBritish contributions are the United Nations Development Programme andother UN aid and relief agencies, as well as some Regional DevelopmentBanks.6. Of bilateral capital aid in 1970, nearly three quarters was in the formof financial loans, and just over one quarter in the form of grants. Themajority of the loan commitments were interest free. The purpose or function of bilateral capital aid is best described over a run of years, since the chanceincidence of commitment and rate of expenditure may distort the annualpattern. Over the five year period 1966-70 commitments of project aid totalled 373 million, of which 12 per cent was for renewable natural resources includ-ing agriculture, 9 per cent for industry, 23 per cent for economic infrastructure(power, communications), and 11 per cent for investment in social services(health, education, etc.). Over the same period, commitments of non-projectaid totalled  356 million, of which 17 per cent was budgetary aid, 63 per cent for current imports, 11 per cent debt refinancing, and 3 per cent was fordisaster relief.7. Technical assistance financed bilaterally in 1970 included the provisionof over 15,000 experts and teachers to overseas activities as well as 2,000volunteers, and the education in the UK of nearly 8,000 students and over4,000 trainees.8. Nearly 90 per cent of bilateral capital aid and technical assistance in1970 went to Comonwealth countries including the remaining dependencies;of this just under one-third went to the Indian subcontinent and a similar pro-portion to Commonwealth Africa. Just over 10 per cent went to foreigncountries.e.c. AND OTHER OVERSEAS services. This programme now includes payments to the European communi-ties. The other expenditure is directed to the promotion of British interests

The estimates are based on those given in the White Paper &quot;TheUnited Kingdom and the European Communities&quot; (Cmnd 4715) for the pos-sible net contribution to the Community budget (paragraph 93) and for pay-ments to the European Investment Bank (paragraph 135) and European coal and Steel Community (paragraph 159). The paid up subscription to capital ofthe European Investment Bank will be  37.5 million, to be paid in five equalinstalments during the two-and-a-half years after accession. The UnitedKingdom will also make a contribution to the Reserves of the Bank on 1stJanuary 1973. This is currently estimated at  20 million. The investment of 24 million in the reserve funds of the Coal and Steel Community will bemade in three equal instalments starting from the date of accession. Theremaining element in the estimate in Table 2.4 is a financial year apportion-ment of the estimates in Cmnd 4715 of the contribution to the community budget. overseas representation3. This expenditure includes the cost of the Foreign and commonwealth office (FCO) in London, British diplomatic and consular representation inmore than 120 missions overseas, and official delegations to 7 major inter-national organisations. It covers the cost of staff (excluding those engaged on information work), a well as their office and private accommodation abroad,and official travel.4. The Diplomatic Service is responsible for representing and promotingBritish interests abroad. This includes the handling of intergovernmentalrelations; advice on foreign policy; protecting the interests of British nationalsabroad; promoting Britain&apos;s visible and invisible exports by assisting british commercial organisations and firms and by conducting bilateral and multi-lateral negotiations on international trade and payments; and representingHMG in international organisations.
5. This item includes also the cost of the Overseas Development Admini-stration, the Passport Offices in London and other centres, and the com-munications organisation in support of the Diplomatic Service.Overseas information6.  This covers three main elements:(i) A proportion (now 65%) of British Council expenditure to promotewider knowledge of the United Kingdom and the English languageabroad and to develop closer cultural relations with other countries.The Council is represented in 75 overseas countries. Its activities in-clude the training of teachers of English, the promotion of the use ofBritish books abroad, exchanges of people, assistance to overseasstudents in Britain and the promotion of a wider knowledge overseasof British arts. The remainder of the CounciFs expenditure is includedin Overseas aid.(ii) The cost of the BBCs External Services. These broadcast in english and 39 other languages for over 700 hours per v/eek and aim to informthe largest possible foreign audiences about Britain and the part itplays in international trade and politics, and to influence themtowards British policies, institutions, and business. In addition,the BBC External Services supply a large number of radio pro-grammes in recorded form to overseas broadcasting stations andare also responsible for the teaching of English by radio. The expen-diture covers both. operating expenses, including programme staff and engineering costs, and also capital expenditure, much of whichis allocated to improving the range and quality of reception. A con-tribution to the cost of the BBC Monitoring Service is also included under this heading.(hi) The cost of FCO information staff and operations at home and abroad and of supporting services of the Central Office of Information andthe Stationery Office. The aim of Information staff and their support-ing services is to ensure by personal contacts, the provision of material in all media, reference services and a programme of visits to the UK,an awareness of Britain&apos;s international role and interests; to secure,by publicity abroad, understanding and support for the policies of her majesty&apos;s Government; and to achieve a favourable opinion abroadfor Britain, its business and nationals.Other external relations7. This expenditure mainly comprises other international commitments and subscriptions, including United Kingdom&apos;s assessed contributions toregular budgets of United Nations organisations and of the Organisation for economic Co-operation and Development, the Council of Europe and theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Secretariat costs).AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRYAgricultural support . This heading covers both that part of agricultural support which takes the form of deficiency payments under price guarantees and also the produc-tion grants and other subsidies for farmers, along with the associated admini-strative costs. Because of the special difficulties of forecasting this expenditure,

It has alwaysbeen recognised that, in practice, expenditure might turn out higher or lower than the projected figures.2. During the period covered by the White Paper, expenditure on agri-cultural support will of course be affected by entry into the e.c.. deficiency round during the transition will depend not only on the level of U.K.guarantee prices, but also on CAP intervention prices and the steps by whichmarket prices in the U.K. are raised successively towards the CAP targetprices. As in Cmnd 4578, therefore, arbitrary deductions have been made for1972-73 and subsequent years which along with a saving of  25 millionassured for 1971-72, reflect the policy announced in Cmnd 4578 of savingabout  150 million in deficiency payments by the operation of levies.Other Assistance to Agriculture3. Most of the other expenditure by Government Departments on agri-cultural, horticultural, and food services is included here. About half of thetotal comprises salaries and other administrative expenses not included in agricultural support. Of the balance the biggest element is the bacon stabilisation-sation scheme. As with agricultural support, some of the expenditure hasbeen projected forward on a conventional basis. Here too expenditure maybe affected by entry to the e.c. but at present it is impossible to reflect this in the figures.Explanation of changes4. The main revision classified as a policy change is that this year&apos;white Paper figures take account of the results of the 1971 Annual Reviewof Agriculture which was assessed at an increase of  46.6 million. The figure for 1974-75 takes account of changes in the world of MAFF which were announced in Cmnd 4564 and mentioned on page 19 of Cmnd 4578, butnot allowed for in the figures.
5. The big estimating change for 1970-71 is attributable mainly to the saving on deficiency payments in that year.Fisheries6. The main expenditure under this heading relates to subsidies for the fishing industry and grants and loans for new vessels and equipment. future expenditure on these depends on operating results and on the plan for capital investment which may be made by the industry. Neither can be forecast withaccuracy.Forestry7. Public expenditure on forestry consists of fixed investment by theState Forestry Enterprise (trading) on roads, buildings and equipment; thenet cost each year of growing timber in the State-owned forests (i.e. theincrease in the value of the Forestry Commission^ plantations); and expendi-ture on the Forestry Authority of about  3 million a year, mainly on research, and grants to private woodland owners. The increase in expenditure over the period is due to the element representing the value of stocks. Thefigures make no allowance for any changes which may result from theGovernments current review of forestry policy.RESEARCH COUNCILS ETC.TABLE 2.6   million	1970-71 provisional outturn	1971-72 estimate	1972-73 estimate	1973-74 estimate	1974-75 estimate	1975-76 estimate at 1971 Survey prices						Research Councils (including the Social Science Research Council), etc.        ......

The first line in the above table shows expenditure for which the Sec-retary of State for Education and Science is responsible and it includesexpenditure by the Agricultural, Medical, Natural Environment and science research Councils, the Social Science Research Council, the British Museum(Natural History) and grants and services for scientific purposes. The council for Scientific Policy advises the Secretary of State on the allocation of this&quot;Science Budget.&quot;2. The second line shows expenditure for which the Secretary of Statefor Scotland is responsible. It covers agricultural research in Scotland carriedon at eight research institutes which are grant-aided. While special emphasis is placed on the needs of Scottish agriculture, their programmes contribute to agricultural research as a whole and are co-ordinated with the programmesundertaken by those institutes which are controlled by the Agricultural Re-search Council.3.   The figures reflect reductions in expenditure on the &quot;Science Budget&quot;
of  1 million for 1973-74 and of  3 million for 1974-75 which have been madesince the publication of Cmnd 4578 in order to bring the growth of expenditureon this block budget more into line with that of public expenditure programmes as a whole. This results in an average annual growth rate of 3.1 per cent forthe period 1971-72 to 1975-76. This is higher than the corresponding annual rate of growth (2.0 per cent) of the total of all programmes, but by 1974-75 thegrowth rate of the Science Budget will have dropped to the lower level.4.

The Science Research Council, which is the largest, at present accounts for about half of the expenditure of all Councils. It sponsors a wide range of scientific and technological research and postgraduate study, mainly inUniversities and in its own establishments. About one-quarter of its expen-diture is however accounted for by subscriptions to international organisations,of which by far the most important are the European Space Research Organi-sation (ESRO) and the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN).6. The Medical Research Councils main function is to advance know-ledge that will improve the physical and mental health of individuals in thecommunity. To this end it supports research in its own institutes, universities and elsewhere. The Council also pays the UK subscription to the InternationalInstitute for Research on Cancer. The Agricultural Research CounciPs mainwork involves advancing knowledge about plants and animals so that agri-cultural productivity may be improved. For the most part the work whichit supports is conducted at the CounciPs 9 Research Institutes and 13 ResearchUnits and at other state-aided institutions.7. The Natural Environment Research CounciFs main concern is withthe earth sciences, oceanography and ecology. Its research into the causes andcontrol of pollution forms a significant part of its budget. Amongst its largercomponent bodies are the Institute of Geological Sciences, the NationalInstitute for Oceanography, the Nature Conservancy and the British AntarcticSurvey. The bulk of the Social Science Research CounciPs expenditure is divi-ded about equally between grants for research and grants for postgraduateuniversity training in the social sciences. Additionally, the Council has three
small units of its own, for research relating to race relations, surveys andindustrial relations. The Council is also responsible for the UK Government^contribution to the International Institute for the Management of Technology.8. All the Councils make some provision for postgraduate education,but the bulk comes from the Science Research Council and Social science research Council. The number of awards these Councils estimated as currentin October .1971 were respectively 7,790 (240 being fellowships) and 3,159(29 being fellowships and 780 bursaries).TRADE, INDUSTRY AND EMPLOYMENTTABLE 2.7   million	1970-71	1971-72	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	rro-visional	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn					At 1971 Survey prices						Department of Trade and Indus-						try						General support programme						Administration        ......	28-8	28-8	24-9	24-3	24	24Research establishments (includ-						ing Atomic Energy Authority)	59-1	60-9	54-1	48-8	43	40Support for  industrial tech-	15-2	13-3	14-6	13-1	12	12nology Civil aviation &amp;shipping	26-5	25-0	26-9	311	27	25services Promotion of tourism,						exports etc....       ......	12-8	15-9	16-9	15-2	15	15Total............	142-4	143-9	137-4	132-5	121	116Promotion of local employment						Gross............	73 0	77-0	94-1	107-1	112	118Loan repayments, rents and						sales ............	-21-4	-27-0	-27-6	-30-6	-35	-39Aircraft projects &amp; assistance						Concorde      .........	65-8	75-0	87-1	93-3	75	4RB211.............	121	80-0	38 0	38-0	15	-10Other   ............	36-5	32-4	8-3	2-0	1	3rJL.,,r&quot;,Civil aerospace R&amp;D......	24-7	25-6	34-5	36-8	39	37Assistance to the coal industry	23-1	16-8	13-3	11-4	6	3Residual expenditure of the 1958-59	25-0	-17-6	-13-5	-8-8	-6	-24Investment grants       ......	592-9	5110	275-0	136-0	74	37Other services    .........	12-0	21-2	29-7	16-1	11	13Total............	986-1	938-3	676-3	533-8	413	255Department of Employment and						other departments						Employment services    ......	90 0	87-2	93-3	94-5	95	94Redundancy Fund payments   ...	47-1	61-6	53-8	49-0	46	46SET additional payments	7-4	0 1	0 1	 	 	Regional employment premiums	109-6	1C6-9	107-2	106-9	72	2Covent Garden Market Authority						(capital expenditure)......	5-9	7-5	6-5	5-0	1	 Miscellaneous services ......	4-4	10-7	11-0	11-1	9	9British Petroleum rights issue ...	 	29-9	29-9	 	 	 Total............	264-4	303-9	301-8	266-5	223	151GRAND TOTAL......	1250-5	1242-2	978-1	800-3	636	406Changes from Cmnd 4578 revalued						policy changes.........	-I-72-1	+ 102-0	+77-S	+44-0	+21	 estimating changes    ......	-46-2	-82-6	-23-1	+29^4	+ 22	 Cmnd 4578 revalued(x)......	1224-6	1222-8	923-7	726-9	593	(J) See Notes on Methodology, paragraph 2, page 00.
Department of Trade and IndustryGeneral Support Programme:1. This block of expenditure covers a very wide range of activities, provid-ing support for industry in various forms. It consists of expenditure of a kind which can be programmed ahead, and is managed by the Department as a block budget, i.e. within an agreed ceiling. The main elements are industrial research and development and other measures to encourage industrial effi-ciency and technological progress; safety and other services to civil aviation and shipping; and programmes to promote tourism and exports. The cost of major individual projects or support schemes, however, are shown else wherein the Departments expenditure programme. It is expected that from 1972-73onwards spending will be some  9-10m less on a comparable basis thanenvisaged in Cmnd 4578.Administration2. This includes the cost of the Departments Headquarters and regional offices; the Patent Office; the Metrication Board and the Monopolies Corn-mission. The reason for the reduction between 1971-72 and 1972-73 isthe transfer of staff to the new Civil Aviation Authority from April 1972.Research establishments (including those of the Atomic Energy Authority)3. The Department^ industrial research establishments undertake workfor Government Departments, for other public authorities and for industry.There are three multi-purpose establishments (National Physical Laboratory,National Engineering Laboratory and Warren Spring Laboratory) and threemore specialised establishments (Torry Research Station, Laboratory of theGovernment Chemist and Safety-in-Mines Research Establishment). Activitiesinclude, for example, the work of the National Physical Laboratory on stan-dards and on shipbuilding design, and of the National Engineering Laboratoryon the application of numerical control to machine tools. The Laboratory ofthe Government Chemist does analytical and advisory work required forregulatory purposes by Government Departments.4. The establishments of the Atomic Energy Authority undertake bothnuclear and non-nuclear research and development. The major part of theexpenditure is on the development of nuclear reactors for the generation ofelectricity, and nearly half of this (some  20 million) is at present concen-trated on the fast breeder reactor. By 1975-76 a number of reactor develop-ment projects will have been largely or entirely completed, leaving the fastbreeder reactor as the principal object of development expenditure at thattime. Reactor work is also undertaken on repayment for e.g. British NuclearFuels Ltd, the Generating Board and the two nuclear design and construc-tion companies. The facilities and expertise of the establishments are alsoused in the application of nuclear science in a variety of non-nuclear fields.5. At both the Industrial Research Establishments and the establishments of the Atomic Energy Authority increased emphasis is being placed on theneed to undertake work in response to the demands of the customers, whetherGovernment Departments or industry, on a repayment basis.Support for industrial technology6. This is a very diversified programme of support both for the engineer-ing industries and, in some respects, for industry generally. Contracts in various
fields of advanced technology are normally undertaken on a cost-sharingbasis with industry, such as those in support of ICL announced in the Houseof Commons by the Minister for Aerospace on 30 July 1971. Pre-productionpurchases of advanced machine tools and other equipment are supported to stimulate the British machine tool and other industries. A number of advisory and productivity services are assisted; for example the ComputerAided Design Centre at Cambridge which is pioneering the application of computers to engineering; and the National Computing Centre in Man-chester which provides a wide range of assistance to computer users. the aim is to bring these advisory and productivity services, as soon as possible,to a position where they can be fully self-supporting. This heading also coversgrants to Industrial Research Associations and Government funded expendi-ture by the National Research Development Corporation in support of research and development projects in a variety of fields. The activities of the NRDCare at present the subject of an independent review.Civil aviation and shipping services. Most of this expenditure is on activities which will become the respon-sibility of the Civil Aviation Authority on 1 April 1972. The forecasts providefor a grant in aid throughout the period and include capital expenditure bythe Authority. The Authority&apos;s main function will be the operation of thenational air traffic services. But it will also be responsible for other measuresto improve safety in civil aviation, for the work now done by the Air Regis-tration Board, for economic regulation of the air transport industry and forthe operation of Aberdeen and the Highlands and Islands Group of aero-dromes. Most of the expenditure on shipping services is directed towardsimprovement of safety at sea, and new measures are being introduced toimprove navigation in the English Channel.Promotion of tourism, exports, etc.8. Provision is made for continued support to the British TouristAuthority and the English Tourist Board, including expenditure in Englandof  -i-m per year on the limited scheme of assistance to tourist projects in thedevelopment areas announced in the White Paper on Investment Incentives(Cmnd 4516). Provision for expenditure on the hotel loans and grants schemeis included under the heading &quot;Other services&quot; (paragraph 17 below). Morethan half of the total provision, however, is for the British Export board which will assume direction of the export promotion programme on 1 January1972. Other activities under this heading include assistance to the Council ofIndustrial Design and terminal Government funded expenditure by theNational Film Finance Corporation.Promotion of local employment9. This programme plays an important part in the Government^ regional policy and, particularly, in the location of new industries in the development and Intermediate Areas. Largely as a result of the additional measures ofassistance announced by the Government in October 1970 and subsequentlyit is expected, as the forecasts show, that the level of expenditure will risesignificantly in the next few years. Building grants and loans to firms provid-ing employment in the Development Areas comprise a substantial part of theexpenditure; building grants are also available in the Intermediate Areas. In
addition to direct financial assistance, the programme includes the building of factories for sale or lease to industry and the development of IndustrialEstates in all assisted areas. Since expenditure depends primarily on the response of industry to the assistance offered and that, in turn, on economicconditions, it is difficult to make accurate forecasts of expenditure for morethan a limited period ahead.Aircraft projects and assistance10. The forecast of expenditure in support of Concorde includes provisionfor the UK share of the development cost of Concorde within the total of 885m announced by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on10 May 1971. It also includes the estimated amount of the loans to be ad-advanced to the manufacturers to support the Concorde production programme.11. The Government has agreed to finance Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd. inthe development and production of the RB 211 engine for the LockheedTristar aircraft. The forecasts provide for the completion of development andfor meeting the net losses which it is recognised the company will incur onthe existing orders for 555 engines.12. Under other aircraft projects and assistance the forecasts provide forsome existing launching aid projects and other assistance, partly offset byreceipts. The figures for 1970-71 include  30m for the down payments on the rolls-Royce assets; those for 1971-72 and 1972-73 include  30m and  5mrespectively for working capital for Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd. No provision has been made for the balance of the purchase price of Rolls-Royce assets.Civil aerospace research and development13. This includes first, expenditure on space. The National Space pro-gramme covers mainly the study and development of applications technologysatellites. The international programme covers collaboration with the member states of the European Space Conference on applications satellites pro-grammes. Secondly provision is made for continuing support for workon probable future civil aircraft, including electronics systems and aero engines. The work is carried out in industry, at universities and in Ministryof Defence (Procurement Executive^) Aerospace Establishments. It is designedto provide technical backing for Government decisions on policy in the civilfield and to assist in ensuring a competitive capability in British industry.Assistance to the coal industry14. The forecasts provide for continued assistance under the Coal industry act 1971, to help ensure an orderly rundown of the industry and alleviatehardship. The main measures are grants in connection with pit closures(e.g. contributions towards the additional costs of housing miners transferredto other pits, redundancy payments and contributions to staff superannuationschemes for early pension), refunding of supplementary payments to elderlymineworkers made redundant, and reimbursement of contributions to super-annuation funds in respect of elderly redundant mineworkers.Residual expenditure of the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation15. Provision is made for expenditure and repayments in respect of com-commitments entered into by the Corporation. The forecasts are somewhat lower than those contained in Cmnd 4578 due mainly to an earlier realisation of assets than was expected.
Investment grants16. The sharply declining forecasts reflect the decision to discontinue the investment grants scheme. They provide mainly for residual expenditurearising from contracts entered into by industry before 27 October 1970.There are still great uncertainties surrounding the forecasts, because thetotal expenditure under these contracts which will be found after examinationto qualify for investment grants cannot yet be predicted with accuracy.Other services17. Expenditure on existing industrial investment schemes, local authority expenditure on aerodromes and the hotel loan and grants scheme, come underthis heading. It also includes forecast expenditure on financial assistance formineral exploration and assistance to the shipbuilding industry (both by the shipbuilding Industry Board and directly by the Government) up to the end of1971-72.Expenditure on new projects and schemes18. With programmes giving such a wide range of activities the Depart-ment of Trade and Industry cannot forecast ahead with great accuracythe calls there may be for new expenditure. Minor additions to its pro-grammes would normally be covered in the General Support Programme(paragraph 1 above). But the timing and cost of major new projects orschemes of industrial assistance cannot always be foreseen. Some of theseindeed may arise as a result of. emergencies. The forecast of expendituregiven above do not therefore in general attempt to provide for major addi-tional expenditures of this kind.General19. The main changes in this programme subsequent to Cmnd 4578 arise from the Government decision to fund Rolls Royce (1971) Ltd. and the RB211 engine and from the increases in provision for Concorde announced inthe House on 10 May 1971. The changes in the figures for investment grants in 1970-71 and 1971-72 are partly the result of a decision in February 1971to accelerate into the former year payments of grant, which would otherwise have fallen in the latter year, in order to provide some improvement in indus-trial liquidity.Department of Employment and other departmentsEmployment services20. Employment services comprise expenditure by the Department ofEmployment and expenditure by local authorities on services (including the youth employment service) for which the Department makes grants.21. The estimates consist mainly of expenditure on the Departmentsplacing and training services. The placing service for adults operates throughrather more than a thousand offices. Its aim is to help job seekers find em-ployment and employers find workers more rapidly and effectively than theyotherwise would. In 1970-71 the adult employment service received about.1 million vacancies and made about 1.4 million placings. The government training Service, operated mainly through Government Training Centres,provided training, mainly in skilled occupations, for nearly 16,000 people in1970-71. In addition the Department grant aided the training of 57,000 men
and women in new and expanding firms in the Assisted Areas. The industrial training Board, which exist to promote training in the industries they cover,are financed by their own levies but receive grants from the Department to foster particular types of training and training in the Assisted Areas.22. The other main items of the Department^ expenditure are servicesoffered to disabled persons, and safety, health and welfare, including theFactory Inspectorate with an average complement of about 700 in 1970-71.Specialised placing services for disabled persons are available in the Employ-ment Exchange service, facilities for the rehabilitation of disabled persons are provided in Industrial Rehabilitation Units, and grants aremade towards the provision of employment for severely disabled persons inRemploy factories and other sheltered workshops. More than 11,000 disabled persons successfully completed courses in Industrial Rehabilitation Units in1970-71 and 12,600 severely disabled persons were employed in Remployfactories and local authority and other sheltered workshops. The Departmentalso makes grants towards the cost of the Youth Employment Service to thoselocal authorities who have elected to provide it.23. The increase over the period to 1975-76 is due mainly to further development of the placing, advisory and industrial training services andthe implementation of the Industrial Relations Act. The forecasts for theGovernment Training Service provide for a total of 37,000 trainees in 1975-76compared with 16,000 in 1970-71; and the increase in the volume of training is under review. Forecasts provide also for the numbers of persons attendingIndustrial Rehabilitation Units to rise to about 12,000 by 1975-76, and em-ployment in Remploy factories and sheltered workshops is estimated to rise to14,000 by that year.Redundancy Fund Payments24. Through rebate payments to employers the Redundancy Fund meetspart of the total amount payable to employees under the Redundancy Pay-ments Act. Guarantee payments are also made from the Fund to redundantworkers to cover the full amount due when the employer is in financial diffi-culties. The fund is administered by the Department of Employment and isfinanced by employers&apos; contributions collected through the National Insurancestamp. The forecasts take account of past and current experiences of demands on the Fund. Provision is made for expenditure on guarantee and rebate pay-ments, the cost of administering the scheme and minor miscellaneous items.Selective Employment Tax additional payments and regional employmentpremiums25. Selective Employment Tax additional payments were abolished with effect from 1 April 1970 but because payment is made in arrears small provi-sion is made for belated claims in 1971-72 and 1972-73. The regional employ-ment premium which is paid in respect of manufacturing establishments in development areas will be discontinued from September 1974.Miscellaneous Services26. Included under this heading the expenditures of the Highlands and islands Development Board, and the Scottish and Welsh Tourish Boards, in-cluding expenditure on the hotel loans and grants scheme, and on the sub-sequent scheme of assitance to tourist projects in Development Areas. The
total provision for these purposes is shown under &quot;Trade, Industry and Em-ployment&quot; in Tables 2.22 and 2.24 below.BP rights issue27. The Government holds 48.6 per cent of the BP ordinary stock. It hasbeen announced that the Government is taking up the rights allotted to it inthe  120m issue.NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES CAPITAL expenditure . The capital expenditure programmes of the nationalised industries are designed to meet the demands of their customers for products and services in the most efficient way. This expenditure differs from that of other publicprogrammes, in that it is mainly determined by commercial caonsiderations and the Government take account of this in deciding the programmes in their annual review.2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced on 19 July that nationa-lised industries should match the CBI initiative on price restraint. However,at the same time he made it clear that the industries&apos; investment programmes would not be affected as a consequence of that decision. The industries willbe able to borrow from the National Loans Fund to finance investment which,in the absence of price restraint, would have been financed from internalresources.3. The forecast growth in expenditure by nationalised industries over the5-year period arises mainly from estimates of increasing demand for electricity and telecommunications and the need to modernise the steel industry.4. For the nationalised industries as a whole, experience has shown thatinvestment expenditure tends to fall short of the approved figure. Provisionalestimates suggest that in 1970-71 expenditure on fixed assets was just under 100 million lower than that forecast by the industries themselves a yearpreviously and allowance is made for short-fall accordingly as shown inTable 2.8. By their very nature these estimates of shortfall cannot be attri-buted to particular industries and are subject to very wide margins of error.5. In 1970-71 capital expenditure other than fixed investment was signi-ficantly above that forecast in Cmnd 4578. This rise was largely due torecovery of fuel stocks by the electricity industry. For subsequent years, themain estimating change is that resulting from the deferment of expenditure by the British Overseas Airways Corporation on purchases of aircraft (para-graph 16 below). Under policy changes, the largest increase is in the amounts(which are provisional for 1972-73 onwards) for steel fixed investment; (para-graph 11); provision has also been made for an increase in Other capital ex-penditure.Fuel6. Investment by the nationalised energy industries is governed largely by estimates of future demand.7. Fixed investment by the National Coal Board on main stream activityis forecast to decline slightly during the period. Investment in deep miningis at present directed towards replacing and modernising equipment and facilities, and not towards increasing capacity. Estimates of future demandfor coal are subject to considerable uncertainty; but investment in coalmining

The figures in Table 2.8 also cover some investment by the Board
in ancillary and diversified activities and loans to an off-shore North Seagas subsidiary. These activities are subject to review under the Coal industry act 1971.9. The level of investment in electricity generating capacity is determinedmainly by the forecast level of simultaneous maximum demand for the sixthand seventh winters ahead (i.e. when capacity started in the first year is planned to come into service) and by the margin of capacity judged necessaryto provide for variations of the actual demand from the forecast, taking intoaccount the risk of breakdowns of plant etc. The tendency of recent years for load forecasts to be reduced continued in 1971; the 1971 forecasts forGreat Britain for 1976-77 was 62,500 MW, virtually the same as the 1970estimate for 1975-76. This implies a rate of growth of maximum demand for electricity of about 5  per cent a year. Reductions in forecasts of demandare reflected in reductions in the number of power stations ordered; the figures in Table 2.8 assume that only one more station will be ordered in 1972.However, provision is in any event required for the completion of stationsalready ordered and for those which will need to be ordered in future years.10. Demand for gas is rising rapidly as increasing supplies of natural gasfrom the North Sea become available. It is expected that some 15,000 milliontherms will be sold in 1975-76, compared with just over 6,000 million thermsin 1970-71. Almost the whole of demand in 1975-76 will be met by directsupply of natural gas, absorption of which is expected to amount to 4,000million cubic feet a day by 1975, in line with the industry&apos;s planning target.The investment of the industry is dominated by the programme of conversionto natural gas. By 31 March 1971, 1,900 miles of the national transmissionsystem had been brought into operation, the appliances of 3.6 million custo-mers had been converted to take natural gas direct, and natural gas accoun-ted for nearly 70 per cent of all gas supplied, whether by way of reforminginto town gas or of direct supply. On the basis of present discoveries expendi-ture on transmission and distribution has passed its peak, while expendi-ture on the conversion of appliances should reach a peak in the current year.Steel11. Approval of the programme for 1971-72 at the level in Table 2.8was announced by the Secretary of State for Trade &amp; Industry on 28 June1971, following completion of the first stage of his review of the British steel corporation^ finances and development plans which he had announced on18 March 1971. The amount is some  40 million higher than the provision in cmnd 4578 (revalued at 1971 Survey prices), mainly because of acceleration of the major &quot;Anchor&quot; project at Scunthorpe. Approval followed examinationof the Corporation^ programme to establish that it could proceed in fullwithout pre-judging the results of the second, long-term, stage of the review which is in progress.12. The figures in Table 2.8 for the years after 1971-72 are the Corpora-tion&apos;s estimates of the investment required. They are necessarily no morethan provisional pending the results of the long-term review.Post Office13. The telecommunications capital programme accounts for about 90per cent of the Post Office figures in Table 2.8 and the amount estimated for1975-76 is about 25 per cent more than for 1970-71. The programme within
the United Kingdom includes provision for conversion of the few remainingmanual telephone exchanges to automatic working; extension of subscribertrunk dialling facilities to all customers; an addition of over 5.5 million newexchange connections over the next five years; augmentation of trunk routes to relieve traffic congestion and to meet growth in long-distance calls; andto provide for growth of connections to the telex service and in data terminals.Profitable new facilities which in some respects make more intensive use ofexisting lines and equipment are in various stages of planning and implement-tation.14. For all these purposes investment will be made in new exchanges,extensions to existing exchange buildings and equipment, enlargement oflocal line networks to customers&apos; premises and increase cable capacity fortelephone and other telecommunications services. Roughly one-third of the investment is for exchange equipment, and a rather higher proportion forline plant. Of the remainder, the largest single item is for land and buildings.For telecommunications services overseas, the programme covers new andenlarged international exchanges to relieve congestion and to meet increasingtraffic.15. Rather less than 10 per cent of the Post Office estimates is for invest-ment in postal services. Approaching three-quarters of it will be devoted tothe plant and buildings required under the plans for mechanisation of theletter and parcel services. The essential feature of the letter plan is to makethe fullest use of code-sorting machinery, by concentrating sorting work in a greatly reduced number of mechanised offices. This in turn will simplify thepresent complex circulation system. The parcel plan is broadly similar inconcept. When completed, both plans are expected to make possible sub-stantial manpower savings. The remaining postal expenditure will be mainly on replacement of obsolescent buildings and vehicles.Ainvays and Airports16. Most of the capital expenditure by the two air corporations, british overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British European Airways (BEA)is on the purchase of new aircraft for replacement and expansion. BEA are continuing the development of the Trident aircraft, introducing now thehigher capacity Trident 3B. They are reassessing their market for wide-bodiedaircraft, which are not now likely to be introduced before 1975. No choice has yet been made between alternative types. BOAC are already building up afleet of Boeing 747s and will have 12 in operation by the summer of 1972.The current figures envisage a much slower build-up of their subsonic fleet inthe ensuing years than was assumed in Cmnd 4578, reflecting a change ofprospects. Provision for Concorde is also included in the estimates. The british airways Board which is currently being set up will in future take responsi-bility for the investment programmes of the two air corporations and theirsubsidiaries.17. The estimates of the British Airports Authority (BAA) take accountof some initial expenditure on Foulness the forecast of which is inevitablytentative at this stage as details of cost and finance cannot yet be worked out.The heavy expenditure at Foulness will, however, come in the second half ofthe decade. The bulk of the BAA&apos;s investment programme up to 1975-76is on projects at existing airports, mainly Heathrow and Gatwick, which
are needed to cater for the growth in traffic before an airport at Foulness canbe operational.Surface Transport Industries18. The largest of the surface transport industries, the British railways board (BRB), are now engaged in further strategic studies following their first Corporate Plan. These will help to determine the long-term investmentneeds of the railways. For the moment, the bulk of railway investment (around 50 million a year) is in the replacement of old track by continuously weldedrail, the installation of new telecommunication and signalling systems, andthe Glasgow/Weaver Junction electrification. The Board also expect to investabout  20 million during 1972 in new locomotives, passenger and freightrolling stock, and terminal facilities. Capital expenditure on the London andSouth East commuter network is judged by social as well as purely financialcriteria and is therefore treated as infrastructure expenditure and appearsunder Surface transport, table 2.10.19. The National Freight Corporation are currently rationalising thecommercial operations of some of their road haulage subsidiaries. About70 per cent of their investment is in vehicles for the road haulage fleet.20. Levels of investment by the National Bus Company are lower than in cmnd 4578. This reflects a lower level of vehicle replacement, largely attribut-able to a reappraisal of needs in the light of declining demand. The numberof passenger journeys fell by about 4 per cent between 1969 and 1970. progress has however been maintained on the conversion programme to one-man-operated buses, and it is estimated that by 1975 about three quarters of totalstage carriage miles will be one-man-operated.21. Over the 5 years investment in buses represents over 60 per cent ofthe capital programme of the Scottish Transport Group. Most of the re-mainder is in the modernisation of their shipping fleet (with roll-on, roll-offvessels) and piers.22. The Government has already announced its intention of winding upthe Transport Holding Company and disposing of its assets. Some of its hold-ings and subsidiaries, including Skyway and Lunn-Poly, have already been sold. Legislation will shortly be introduced in Parliament for the final dissolution-tion of the company and the sale of Thos. Cook and Son Ltd.ROADS1. &quot;Major roads&quot; comprise motorways, trunk and principal roads; &quot;other expenditure&quot; relates principally to lighting and the provision of car parks.The figures take account of the levels of expenditure allowed for in the dis-cussions with the local authorities during the calculation of rate support grant for 1971 -72 and 1972-73.New Construction and Improvements2. The figures in table 2.9 are consistent with the plan for an expandingtrunk road and motorway programme in England announced by the Govern-ment in June 1971. This plan will complete by the early 1980s a 3,500 milenetwork of strategic trunk routes; every major city and town with a popula-tion of more than 250,000 will be directly connected to this network and allwith a population of more than 80,000 will be within about 10 miles of it.
The more remote and less prosperous regions will be linked with the strategicnetwork, which will also serve all major ports and airports. Significant environ-mental benefits will be achieved by diverting long-distance traffic, and particu-larly heavy goods vehicles, from a large number of towns and villages especially-cially those of historic interest. Without this plan, the level of congestion andthe associated economic and social losses would increase rapidly during the1970&apos;s. Inter-urban road projects will, as now, be subjected to economicappraisal and are generally expected to offer a high rate of return in costbenefit terms throughout the 1970s.TABLE 2.9   million	1970-71 provisional outturn	1971-72 estimate	1972-73 estimate	1973-74 estimate	1974-75 estimate	1975-76 estimate at 1971 Survey prices New construction and improvements: Major roads         ......

In Scotland and Wales congestion is a less serious problem but thereis still a need to modernise the busiest trunk routes, and programmes take account of plans for physical and economic development. A new list of majorScottish schemes on which work is to begin was announced in July 1971 while for Wales schemes were announced in December 1970 and April 1971.4. The planning of roads in towns has to be considered together withenvironmental questions, public transport and traffic restraint. There islikely to be a continuing and pressing need for new and improved urbanroads and over the next 5 years the urban road programme is planned to expand at a fast rate to relieve congestion and to further the Governmentsobjective of improving the urban environment.
5. The figures for new construction and improvement on major roads inGreat Britain allow for a rise in expenditure from  456m in 1970-71 to about 615m in 1975-76: an increase of 6.2 per cent a year compound.6. The cost per mile of major roads varies between very wide limits. Thisis due to factors such as the nature of the terrain, the number of bridges andother structures, the width of the highway and the variation in land values:for this reason it would be misleading to quote an average cost per mile.7. Capital expenditure on major roads is based on a firm programmeof schemes on which work is expected to begin within one or two yearssupported by a reserve of schemes in preparation on which work is expectedto begin in subsequent years. Spending in 1970-71 on major roads in Englandsubstantially exceeded estimates mainly because exceptionally fine weathermade it possible for more work to be done and as a result the planned expen-diture in subsequent years was rephased. In addition, in July 1971 the Govern-ment authorised a special programme of expenditure on infrastructure inthe Development Areas. In all an additional  42m will be spent on roads aspart of this infrastructure programme in the three years 1971-74.8. The projections in Table 2.9 show the expected flow of cash pay-ments on old and new schemes at Survey prices. To the extent that paymentsarise from contracts spreading over several years and let at the prices of earlierperiods (i.e. before the Survey date) the projections do not state consistentlythe use of real resources over the period. On the assumption that contractprices reflect the level of costs at the time that they are let the paymentsflowing from motorway and trunk road schemes in the English road pro-gramme have been revalued at November 1970 prices (i.e. 1971 Survey prices for new contracts), to produce an indication of resource use on this basis asline (b) below shows the programmes for 1971-72 and 1972-73 are relativelyundervalued in line (a). On the other hand the whole series in line (b) is affected by unquantifiable allowances which the contractors have made for future inflation.  million	1971-72	1972-73	1973-	-74	1974-75	1975-76	Average annual percentage growth(a) Amounts for English motor-ways and trunk roads included in &quot;major roads&quot;	170-2	195-7	231	0	242-2	255-2	10-5(b) Resource use: with pre-November 1970 contracts revalued.........	181-3	199-2	232	1	242-7	255-2	8-9Maintenance9. The forecasts of maintenance expenditure, which includes cleansing,snow clearing and gritting as well as structural maintenance, have regard tothe increasing mileage of roads and to the growth of traffic. They also include some allowance to reflect the recommendations of the Marshall Committeewhich are directed towards establishing uniform standards of maintenanceagainst which expenditure can be properly evaluated and controlled. TheD
recommendations are being studied, but the problem is complex and imple-mentation will take some years.SURFACE transport table 2.10  million	1970-71	1971-72	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	provisional	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn					At 1971 Survey prices						Department of the Environ-						ment, Scottish Development						Department    and    Welsh						Office						Support     to     nationalised						industries    .........	92-0	87-8	80-9	73-5	63	57Other surface transport:						Ports............	37-3	42-1	41-9	38-6	36	36Bus fuel grants     ......	21-2	22-6	20-8	20-8	23	21Rural bus and ferry services	0-3	0-9	2-4	3-0	3	3Infrastructure expenditure ...	8-1	23-0	44-1	48-1	54	57Other passenger transport ...	31-4	36-3	30-0	30-9	31	27Miscellaneous transport ser-						vices	-1-5	0-3	2-8	6-1	10	10Departmental administration	12-3	12-3	12-2	12-1	12	12Total.........	- 201 -1	225-3	235-1	233-1	232	223Changes   from   Cmnd   4578						revalued						policy changes.........	 	 	 		 	estimating changes......	-17-8	-11-9	-0-2	-f2-7	H-2	Cmnd 4578 revalued (l)	218-9	237-2	235-3	230-4	230	C) See Methodology, paragraphs 2 and 4, page 00.1. The Government provide a wide range of financial assistance designedto sustain public transport facilities. Grants are made to the British railways board (BRB) for unremunerative pasenger services which are judged to besocially and economically necessary but which the Board would otherwiseclose. These grants (included in Support to nationalised industries in Table2.10 above) are expected to amount to about  65 million in 1972-73 and will cover some 230 services, involving about 8,000 passenger route miles. other forms of support include bus fuel grants and a 50 per cent contribution togrants made by local authorities towards the cost of maintaining certain ruralbus and ferry services.2. The Government also provide substantial capital grants to localauthorities and nationalised industries to encourage major public transportimprovements in commuter areas. The investments to which the grants arerelated comprise the infrastructure expenditure in the table. This includes theestimated cost of the Liverpool Terminal Loop, the electrification of certainnorth London suburban rail services, and the first stage of the Fleet Line. Thescope of the grants has recently been extended and new railway rolling stockand resignalling schemes will now be eligible for assistance.3. The improvement of public transport is also encouraged by the avail-ability of new bus grants which have recently been increased from 25 per cent to 50 per cent.These grants are paid in respect if investment made by muni-
cipal bus operators, the Passenger Transport Executives, and the london transport Executive (which appears under Other Passenger Transport, table2.10). (Grants are paid also to the National Bus Company and the Scottish transport Group whose investment appears and Nationalised industriescapital expenditure Table 2.8).4. The other main expenditures in the Surface Transport programme are: Support to nationalised transport industries(a) BRB receive grants pending the elimination of surplus track andsignalling capacity which is at present a burden on their operatingaccount. They will be progressively reduced and will cease after1973-74.(6) The National Freight Corporation also receive grants in respect of the deficit on their subsidiary, National Carriers Limited, which they took over from BRB on 1 January 1969. The grant was tapered and dueto end in 1973-74 by which time it was hoped the subsidiary wouldbe on a sound financial footing. More encouraging progress, however,has resulted in a sharper decrease in grant which will now terminate in1972-73 permitting savings of  3 million to  5 million a year corn-pared with the estimates in Cmnd 4578.(c) The provision includes expenditure for essential maintenance of the waterways and for the improvement to modern traffic standards ofabout 400 of the bridges which carry roads over British WaterwaysBoard canals. Finally, it also covers grants to the Scottish TransportGroup, in respect of losses on Western Highlands and Islands services.Other Surface Transport(a) Ports: the estimates cover investment by public trust and local authorityports. They include continued investment in the new dock complex atSeaforth (amounting to  38m by 1973-74) and a new entrance lock atGrangemouth on the Forth ( 9m by 1973-74).(b) Miscellaneous Transport Services: the main items are road safety and research offset by various fees charged for services such as driving testsand vehicle tests. Road safety expenditure is expected to be slightly higher and research expenditure slightly lower than in Cmnd 4578. Aswell as assistance to the BRB&apos;s research and development programme at the Railway Technical Centre, Derby (where work on the AdvancedPassenger Train is in progress) the research programme includes ex-penditure by the Road Research Laboratory and expenditure on a wide range of transport projects.housing. The White Papers &quot; Fair Deal for Housing &quot; (Cmnd 4728) and &quot; the reform of Housing Finance in Scotland &quot; (Cmnd 4727) set out the Govem-menfs main objectives and describe the proposals for the reform of housing finance which will facilitate the attainment of these objectives.2. The reform of housing finance is the subject of legislation in the pre-sent session of Parliament. Its main features are the introduction of newr principles for rent in the public sector, based on fair rents in England andWales and in Scotland (initially) on rent fixed by reference to local housing
expenditure; for the extension of the fair rent principle in the privately rentedsector, with rent rebates and allowances for those tenants who cannot afford the fair rent on the new basis, and for the rearrangement of subsidies so as to concentrate on areas where the need for new building for replacement, slum clearance or other purposes, is greatest.TABLE 2.11 &apos;  million	1970-71 provisional outturn	1971-72 estimate	1972-73 estimate	1973-74 estimate	1974-75 estimate	1975-76 estimate at 1971 Survey						prices						Subsidies......	370-4	425-8	562-9	462-3	430	428Lending						Gross   ......	195-1	288-2	303-7	305-5	307	307Repayments	-130-4	-154-9	-163-7	-179-7	-196	-214Net     ......	64-7	133-3	140-0	125-8	111	93Investment and						central admini-						stration......	740-5	690-6	689-0	732-0	740	738Total	1,175-6	1,249-7	1,391-9	1,320-1	1,281	1,259Changes from Cmnd						4578 revalued						policy changes	 	4-99-6	+ 108-4	+94-S,	+70	estimating						changes	-38-8	-70-9	-43-0	-76-3	-62	Cmnd   4578   re-						valued(2)	1,214-4	1,221-0	01,326-5	0)1,301-9	OL273	Olncludingan allowance for transferring (by comparison with Cmnd 4578) to Social Security(see Table 2.17) the saving on supplementary benefits.(a) See Notes on Methodology, paragraph 5, page 00.Subsidies3. The figures in the first line of Table 2.11 include estimates of subsidiesby central government in connection with the provision of housing by localauthorities, new town corporations, the Scottish Special Housing association and other housing associations and rent allowances to private tenants. This linealso includes rate fund contributions. Existing housing subsidies, other thanimprovement contributions under the Housing Acts 1969 and 1971 and theHousing (Scotland) Acts 1968 and 1969 (and under earlier superseded legisla-tion) will be replaced as from 1972-73 onwards by the new subsidies described in Cmnd 4727 and 4728. The estimate for 1972-73 is relatively high andreflects the impact of the special provisions proposed to cover the graduatedtransition to the new system. Some provision is also made in that year for payment of arrears under the existing system. Also included are the growingpayments by the Government under the option mortgage scheme and improve-ment grants. The latter are expected to rise both as a result of the generalencouragement which the Government is giving to house improvement and(included under &quot;policy changes&quot;) in consequence of the higher rate of grantprovided for the development and other assisted areas under the housing act 1971.Lending4.  The main constituent in the figures is the provision which has been
made for lending by local authorities to private persons for house purchase.The Government have relaxed the arrangement whereby local authority mort-gage loans to recognised classes of priority borrower were restricted from1967-70 by the imposition upon local authorities of money quotas; the effectof this is included in the figures for &quot;policy changes&quot;. Increased lending bylocal authorities to private persons for house improvement and to housing associations is also envisaged.Investment5. These estimates cover the net capital expenditure on public sector housing by local authorities, new town authorities and the Scottish special housing Association (both on the provision of new houses and the improve-ment of existing ones) and on slum clearance. The estimating changes reflecta decline in the number of new dwellings put to contract by public authoritiesin recent years, offset in some measure by increased spending on home im-improvements. The new slum clearance subsidy will enable local authorities to accelerate slum clearance. New housebuilding by local authorities will continueto be needed not only to replace slums, but also to relieve over-crowding andshortages in areas where housing problems are most severe; these areas will benefit most from the new system of housing finance.MISCELLANEOUS LOCAL services table 2.12   million	1970-71 provisional outturn	1971-72 estimate	1972-73 estimate	1973-74 estimate	1974-75 estimate	1975-76 estimate						At 1971 Survey prices						Capital expenditure						Public health and avoidance						of pollution      ......	268-5	289-3	310-6	322-1	339	358Improvement of the environ-						ment and local facilities	133-6	139-6	152-9	154-2	161	170New Town&apos;s industrial and						commercial development etc.	29-9	31-4	34-2	28-8	31	31Current expenditure						All services.........	500-3	509-3	530-7	553-4	574	595Total      .........	932-3	969-6	1,028-4	1.058-5	1,105	1,154Changes   from   Cmnd   4578						revalued						policy changes      ......	 	+ 10-0	-I-18-0	+ 6^4	4- 1	 estimating changes	-17-3	 	+ 1-9	-14-9	-15	Cmnd 4578 revalued......	949-6	959-6	1,008-5	1,067-0	1,119	This heading covers a wide variety of services, mostly the responsibilityof local authorities.Public health and avoidance of pollution2. These services are mainly those which local authorities and statutoryundertakings are obliged to provide in the interests of public health and thereduction or removal of pollution. Well over half the capital expenditure inthis category is on sewerage and sewage disposal schemes. These generallyserve two or more of a number of purposes   for example, while the occa-
ion for laying new sewers or building a new disposal works may be the need to provide increased capacity for new or improved houses, or the expansionof industry, the opportunity may at the same time be taken to replace leakysewers or obsolescent disposal works, to eliminate risks of flooding by separat-ing surface water from foul sewage, and to raise the standard of effluent so asto improve the river which receives it. With many hundreds of schemes under-taken each year it has not been practicable, hitherto, to apportion estimated expenditure between these several purposes.3. The data collected for the River Pollution Survey (publication of thereport on which should be completed early in 1972) are however being used asthe basis for discussions between the Department of the Environment, the welsh Office and the river authorities about the objectives underlying theauthorities&apos; expected future requirement of local authority sewage disposalworks in England and Wales. These are now being complemented by the col-lection of information from sewerage authorities about their expected pro-grammes of works. If the response is adequate, and the programmes suffi-ciently realistic, it may be possible next year to break down projected ex-penditure by reference to the main purposes of the various schemes as seen by the respective authorities. The Scottish Development Department expects to be in a position at the same time to make a similar analysis of Scottishsewage and sewage disposal schemes.4. Provision of water accounts for a further third of the capital expendi-ture on the first group of services. An average daily total of 2776 million gallons of water is put into supply, and this volume is increasing at a rate of2\ per cent a year. There is also a substantial need for additional reservoircapacity to safeguard supplies at the present level of demand. It costs atpresent about  1.3m for every extra lm gallons per day put into supply, butthis is increasing as the more conveniently situated sources become developed and as more sophisticated treatment is needed as more water is taken for re-use from rivers.5. About 90% of the expenditure is for provision of new supplies, theremainder being for maintaining the existing service.6. The remaining services in the first group include refuse collection and disposal, clean air policy and other public health expenditure. Here too, ex-penditure is expected to rise because of population growth and movement,improvements in living standards and increasing technical problems leading to increased costs. The trend towards incineration rather than tipping ofrefuse is a particular example. As with sewerage any one project may bothmeet increased demand and provide a better standard of service or reducepollution, and expenditure cannot readily be divided between these categories.As compared with Cmnd 4578, some additional provision has been made forthe special programme of expenditure on the infrastructure of the Develop-ment Areas.Improvement of the environment and local facilities7. Local authorities can be expected to have a greater element of choiceover this group of services. They include the provision of parks and sportsfacilities, reclamation of derelict land, and general planning activities as wellas general administrative services. Public expectation as regards sport facilities and environmental improvement is steadily increasing and some increase inthe level of expenditure is therefore provided for. As compared with Cmnd
4578, additional provision has been included for the Development Areasinfrastructure expenditure and for interim measures to prevent flooding ofthe Thames before completion of the barrier.8. Cmnd 4578 drew attention to the element of uncertainty in theseforecasts arising from the new capital control procedures in England andWales which were introduced in April 1971. Individual authorities now havefreedom to determine locally their own order of priorities on certain types of projects within a total allocation. This may result in differences from the pre-cise pattern of local authority capital expenditure by service which has beenforecast. The present uncertainty which affects services both in this block andin others will continue until the outturn of local authority capital expenditure for 1971-72 becomes available.New Towns&apos; industrial and commercial development, etc.9. This group comprises expenditure by new town development corpora-tions, net of disposals to the private sector, mainly on industrial and com-mercial development. About one-third of the expenditure in this field is on land and site works, the remainder on buildings. A similar amount of building is financed directly by the private sector.Current expenditure10. The figures for 1971-72 and 1972-73 are based on the forecasts arrivedat with the local authority associations in the course of the rate support grantsettlements. In general they reflect priorities similar to those applying to capitalexpenditure. For the three later years the figures show the implied effect of continuing, broadly, the rates of growth of local authority expenditure overthe past few years. The actual expenditure in 1973-74 will depend upon theexpenditure decisions of individual authorities in the light of the rate support grant as it is settled in 1972; thereafter expenditure will reflect the decisionsof the proposed new local authorities in the light of whatever arrangements may bs introduced for the financing of local government after reorganisation.

The law and order programme covers expenditure by the Governmentand local authorities. It includes the cost of the Home Departments, the LegalDepartments, the Houses of Parliament and the Privy Council. Most of theexpenditure is incurred by local authorities on services to which the Govern-ment contributes through specific grants or rate support grant.Home Departments&apos; ServicesPolice2. The Governments policy is to strengthen the police and to promotegreater operational efficiency. It is difficult to specify how much of the in-
crease in forecast expenditure is attributable to improvements and how muchto the maintenance of existing standards in the face of growth in the prob-lems (eg crime and traffic) with which the police have to deal. But the forecasts of expenditure include provision for increases in police strength to fill existing and revised establishments, and for increased expenditure on traffic wardensto enable better provision to be made for urban traffic schemes. The forecastsalso include provision for buildings, vehicles and equipment, training, com-munications, forensic science laboratories, the police national computer, re-search and other scientific and technical support. The forecasts assume thatpolice strengths will increase from nearly 105,000 to about 125,000 duringthe period 1971-72 to 1975-76, (compared with a growth of about 10,000over the previous 5 years). In the same period the numbers of civilians areexpected to rise from 38,000 to nearly 65,000 which includes provision foran increase of just over 16,000 traffic wardens (from about 7,000). The fore-casts provide for a steady growth in capital expenditure on equipment andnew improved communications and on buildings to provide for the needsof the expanding service.Prisons3. The forecasts provide for an increase in the inmate population from47,850 to 59,350 over the period, and an increase of nearly 6,000 in non-indus-trial staff of all grades. Capital expenditure accounts for the greater part of theincrease in forecast expenditure, largely on an accelerated building programme and adaptations to existing prisons with a view to accommodating the ex-pected rise in inmate population. Over the period it is planned to provide some10,600 additional places; even so the extent of overcrowding, with nearly16,000 inmates now sleeping 2 or 3 in a cell, would on present trends becomeslightly worse. The additional staff are required both to reduce the currentshortfall in the number of prison officers and to meet the demands of the rising population. Broadly speaking, most of the capital expenditure is on new accommodation; but some provision is made to improve existing facilities in Victorian prisons.Probation and after-care (England and Wales only)4. The forecasts provide for expansion of the service against the back-ground of the increase in crime and the need to treat more offenders in thecommunity as an alternative to imprisonment. The main assumptions are thatthe number of probation officers will rise from 3,250 to 4,475 (compared witha growth of about 900 over the previous 5 years) and ancillary staff from20 to 560 over the period, to relieve skilled probation officers of the moreroutine tasks. Provision is also made for expenditure of  0.2 million in 1971-72 rising to  1.7 million in 1975-76 for an extension of probation hostels,mainly for adults. This is estimated to make about 1,650 additional placesavailable some of which may afford a measure of relief to overcrowdedprisons.Fire services. The growth of expenditure on the fire service relates mainly to man-power, and is attributable partly to meeting the basic needs of the servicewhen fires and fire risks are increasing (for example, fires in buildings in-creased by over 7 per cent annually during the period 1965-1969) and partly
to improving the standards of fire prevention and training. The main assump-tions are that the number of full time firemen will rise from nearly 28,000 to just over 29,000 (compared with virtually no net growth over the previous 5 years) and civilians from about 3,700 to over 4,000 to cover the basic needsof the service, including the extra manpower needed to implement the FirePrecautions Act. In addition provision is included from 1972-73 onwards foran eventual increase of 1,120 firemen and 145 civilians to implement recom-mendations of the Departmental Committee on the Fire Service, mainly toprovide for improved training.Other services. Expenditure under this heading is mostly for grants to statutory or voluntary bodies. Increases over the period are mainly due to the growth ofexpenditure under the Urban Programme for areas of social need ( 3.6 million)and to an estimated annual increase of 900 (from 9,000) in Criminal InjuriesCompensation Board cases. Provision is also made for expenditure on theCommunity Relations Commission, the Race Relations Board and theWomen&apos;s Royal Voluntary Service.Law CourtsEngland and Wales7. The forecasts for magistrates&apos; courts reflect the increasing volume ofwork and provision for an accelerated building programme following the assumed transfer by local authorities to central government of some existing buildings for use as higher courts (as a result of the implementation of therecommendations of the Royal Commission on Assizes and Quarter Sessions).Provision is also made for the introduction of a financial loss allowance and improved subsistence allowances for justices of the peace.8. The higher courts are being radically reorganised in accordance withthe provisions of the Courts Act 1971 which implements the recommenda-tions of the Royal Commission under Lord Beeching for the more efficient administration of the Courts service. Responsibility for the higher courts willpass from local authorities to the central government with effect from1 January 1972. Larger provision is now made for a centralized building programme giving effect to the Beeching recommendations.Scotland9. The forecasts include provision for the court building programme inScotland, including new sheriff courts. The Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1971made provision for the central government to take over the responsibilityfor sheriff court building from local authorities.Legal Aid10. The forecasts assume a continuing increase in the volume of workin accordance with the upward trend of litigation. Provision has also beenmade for the introduction in 1973-74 of an approved scheme of legal advice and assistance (the &quot; 25 scheme&quot;) which involves additional expenditure of 1.2m in the first year rising to  2.3m by 1975-76. This represents an improve-ment in the existing legal aid facilities.

The figure for museumand galleries purchase grants for 1971-72 has been reduced by  0.1m, representingspecial advances of the purchase grant provision for 1971-72 made to two institu-tions during 1970-71.(3) Includes grants to the British Institute of Recorded Sound, the Royal GeographicalSociety, the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, assistance to local museums incarrying out co-operative schemes and psovision for surveys in museums, arts andcrafts.1. The Arts programme now includes capital expenditure on museums and galleries by the Department of the Environment as well as current and capital expenditure on the new British Library, the intended establishment ofwhich was announced in Cmnd 4572 (The British Library). Except for theGreater London Council&apos;s contribution to the National Theatre, and the ex-penditure by Edinburgh Corporation on the proposed new Opera House, theprogramme does not include expenditure by local authorities.National museums, galleries and libraries2. The provision for the national museums and galleries reflects the policies announced in Cmnd 4676 (Future Policy for Museums and Galleries)for an expanded programme of new building and development which is esti-mated to involve additional capital expenditure of  3.6 millions over the years
1972-76 and for the introduction of admission charges in 1972 which are ex-pected to give an annual net yield of  1 million. The annual purchase grants,which are supplemented by special purchase grants in exceptional circum-stances, provide for the steady expansion of the existing collections. The pro-vision for staff salaries, administration, etc, allows for increases each year instaffing and other cost arising from the improvement and development of buildings and the maintenance of enlarged collections.Other arts expenditure3. For the first time, capital provision is included in the Arts programme to cover the cost of constructing the Edinburgh Opera House. The Govern-ment has agreed to bear half the capital cost up to a maximum contributionto Edinburgh Corporation of  2.25 million. This and the National Theatreapart, the main capital provision under this heading is to enable the ArtsCouncils in England, Scotland and Wales to make steady progress with theprogramme for housing the Arts. The provision for substantial annual in-creases in current expenditure is intended in the main to assist the ArtsCouncils to extend the range of their support for creative arts and artisticactivities both centrally and in the regions.4. The figures for the last 2 years are not sub-divided because it is not practicable to settle the provisional allocations, beyond a 3-year period.

Expenditure on education and local libraries and museums in GreatBritain is planned to rise between 1971-72 and 1975-76 by  366 million or 3.0per cent a year. In 1975-76 education will account for 14 per cent of total public expenditure.2. This increasing level of expenditure will provide the buildings andother resources required by the growing number of pupils, including thosestaying on at school when the leaving age is raised, by the bigger teachingforce and by the number of school leavers expected to qualify for higher education.3. While the total of primary pupils is expected to fall between 1971-72and 1975-76 from 5.75 million to 5.65 million, secondary pupils, on the otherhand, will increase in numbers from 3.6 million to 4.43 million, partly becauseof larger age-groups and partly because of the raising of the school leaving age in 1972-73. The increase in the number of teachers from 432,000 to505,000 will have the effect o freducing the number of pupils per teacher from22 in 1971-72 to about 20 in 1975-76.4.   The secondary school forecasts for England and Wales provide for
the additional expenditure arising from increased capitation grants to the direct grant schools and improved remitted fee scales for parents; and inScotland for an interim increase in payments to grant-aided schools pending a more fundamental review of the grant arrangements.5. The higher education forecasts reflect planning assumptions basedon the size of age-groups, levels of attainment and policy considerations. Forexample, the demand on resources for teacher training in England and wales will be influenced by decisions following the report of the James Committee.Similarly, the university forecasts are subject to decisions on the next quin-quennial settlement for the universities in the light of proposals to be madeby the University Grants Committee. In further education the fluctuating fore-casts reflect on the one hand an increase in the number of students undertakingadvanced work and on the other a drop in the numbers attending other coursesas a result of the raising of the school leaving age.6. Within the forecasts of current expenditure on schools and further education, the non-teaching costs include improvement elements comparedwith 1969-70 of  32 million in 1971-72 and a further  63 million in 1975-76.7. The capital expenditure figures are derived from the respective startsprogrammes, which determines the value of work authorised to begin in theyear in question. Because the places do not become available for use untilthe building work has been completed and the amount of time required for construction depends, among other things, on the size and complexity of in-dividual projects, these starts programmes are related to the increased numberof places required for pupils and students by the time the work is finished.8. Because the rate of increase in the school population will decline after1974, the primary and secondary school building programme required to pro-vide additional places becomes smaller after 1972-73. The programme in-cludes, in 1971-72 and 1972-73, the remaining provision for the additionalsecondary school pupils staying on at school when the school leaving age is raised. It also includes starts, already announced, of  50 million in 1972-73and  53 million in each of the three following years for the replacement and improvement of old primary schools. This is an increase on the programmeprovided for in Cmnd 4578 and is reflected in the policy changes shown intable 2.15. Expressed as a percentage of total starts, the improvement elementnow rises from 15 per cent in 1971-72 to 26 per cent in 1975-76.9. The universities and further education building programmes providefor the increased student numbers and some improvement of existing build-ings and take account of the type of courses. From 1973-74 the further edu-cation programme allows for the introduction of new standards of accom-modation for non-teaching areas in the polytechnics and other colleges. the teacher training programme provides mainly for the replacement of the worstsub-standard buildings.10. The capital expenditure forecasts include in the years 1971-74  43million authorised by the Government to be spent on educational building,particularly schools, as part of the special programme of expenditure oninfrastructure in the Development Areas.11. The youth service and local libraries and museums programmes inEngland and Wales were transferred on 1 April 1971 from the control of theDES to the locally-determined sector of local authority capital programmes.The forecasts will be subject to review in the light of the actual expenditure which authorities decide to incur.

The Government has provided, in addition to the growthplanned in last year&apos;s Review, an extra  118 million to be spent within thenext four years, largely on special capital improvements in the hospital serviceand local authority health and personal social services, but also including expenditure associated with the reorganisation of the health services. Amongthe main priorities are the replacement of old institutions and adapted housesused to accommodate old people, together with some increases in accommo-dation; and the increase and improvement of hospital buildings and facilitiesfor the old and mentally ill. The programme also covers increased capitalexpenditure, amounting to  35.2 million over the three years 1971-72   1973-74, on the special programme of expenditure on infrastructure in the develop-ment and intermediate areas recently announced by the Government.2. If the relative price effect is excluded, the increase in total provision in 1972-73 compared with the current financial year is 5.6 per cent for thehospital service, 9.2 per cent for the local authority health and personal social services, and 5.1 per cent for the whole health and personal social
services programme. In that year, 59.7 per cent of the expenditure is on hos-hospitals, 19.6 per cent on the family practitioner services, 18.0 per cent on localauthority health and personal social services, and 2.7 per cent on welfarefoods and other services. The planned average annual compound rate of in-crease between 1970-71 and 1975-76 for the whole programme, again ex-cluding the relative price effect, is 3.9 per cent.Hospital services . Provision is made for current expenditure on the hospital service to grow, at constant prices, at 4.3 per cent in 1972-73, and thereafter at 3.5 percent a year. It is estimated that about one quarter of the annual additions isrequired to maintain the existing standard of service for the increasing andageing population. The remainder (supplemented by savings through improve-ments in efficiency and redeployment of resources) will enable further progress to be made in achieving improvements in the standard of hospital treatment and services generally, and in meeting unsatisfied need. Particular emphasiswill be placed on reducing the inequalities in services between regions andon the improvement of conditions in hospitals and services provided for patients such as the mentally handicapped and mentally ill, the elderly andand younger chronic sick. Patients in wards for the mentally ill and mentally handicapped take up about 30 per cent and 15 per cent respectively of occu-pied hospital beds; of the remaining patients more than 40 per cent are aged65 and over.4. Over the next five years, the capital allocations will make it possibleto replace or bring up to modern standards the equivalent of about one-tenth of all the current hospital facilities: a new district general hospital of someeight hundred beds with all supporting services currently costs about  9million. These allocations will be devoted in the main to the programme of replacing out-of-date hospitals and services, to providing hospitals in newly-populated areas and to establishing modern patterns of service, includingassessment, day-hospital and special treatment facilities, as well as in-patientbeds. It is estimated that something of the order of one-fifth will be spent on making substantial improvements to buildings, plant and equipment in hos-hospitals which will remain in service for many years, and on making minor improvements to other hospitals. It is not planned that the end result shouldbe an increase in the total number of beds. The objective is an improvementin their quality and distribution.Family practitioner services. This heading covers the general medical, dental and ophthalmic ser-vices and the pharmaceutical service which are provided under the national health Service. Net expenditure in 1971-72 shows a reduction over the pre-ceding year, because of the increased charges introduced in 1971 but risesthereafter, partly because development is assumed to continue of more effective, but generally dearer, drugs. The figure reflect the government&apos;s decision, announced on not to introduce a scheme of charges related to thecost of individual prescriptions. An improvement in the standard of service on account of a relative increase (amounting to an annual figure of theorder of 0.5 per cent) in numbers of doctors and dentists as compared withthe increase in the size of the population is projected in the expenditure forecasts.
Local authority health and personal social services. Provision has been made for the local authority health services tocontinue to develop, particularly in the building of Health Centres, and in family planning, nursing, and other domiciliary services (most of the localauthority health services will be transferred to Area Health Authorities whenthe proposed reorganisation of the National Health Service takes place).7. A major objective for the local authority personal social services is toshift the balance of care from hospitals to the community where this is more appropriate. The new group of local personal social services is planned toshow a growth rate at constant prices of 9.2 per cent in 1972-73, and there-after an average annual compound rate of 6.8 per cent. This is a much highergrowth rate than is planned for the hospital service. The main growth pointswill be services for the elderly, the mentally ill, and the mentally and physi-cally handicapped, and the development of a comprehensive system of com-munity homes for children in care to replace the separate provision now madein children&apos;s homes, probation homes and hostels, approved schools, and re-mand homes. One example of the improvements which should be attainableover the next few years is the Government announcement in the White Paper&quot;Better Services for the Mentally Handicapped&quot; (Cmnd 4683) that in thefour years 1971-72 to 1974-75, the resources to be made available for services for the mentally handicapped should allow building starts for nearly 10,000new places in adult training centres, 750 new places in homes for children,and 3,500 new places in homes for adults, on the present plans of localauthorities in England and Wales.

About half of social security expenditure is accounted for by one item,retirement pensions. Other national insurance benefits and industrial injuriesbenefits account for between a fifth and a quarter and the balance is made up by the non-contributory benefits (mainly supplementary benefit and family allowances) and administration (which accounts for approximately 4 per cent of the total).2. Table 2.17 above follows the established convention that social security figures do not reflect changes which may be made in the future but which have not yet been announced since a decision about, for example, theamount of an increase in benefits need not be made too far in advance of thedate from which the increase is to come into effect.(3) The estimates for 1972-73 onwards are therefore based on benefits at their present levels, and the table shows how expenditure will increase in accordance with demographic andother factors affecting the numbers of beneficiaries, quite apart from any future changes-in benefit levels.3. The Government intends to review the basic retirement pension and related benefits every other year and ensure that, as a minimum, they main-tain their value. Allowance is made under &quot;Adjustments to 1971-72 outturn prices and relative price effect&quot; in the Tables in Parts 1 and 3 to take ac-count of the fact that benefits lose their value as prices rise and they have that value restored at each uprating on this biennial pattern. The cost of any(3) See Cmnd 4578, Appendix B, paragraph 5.
real improvement over and above the restoration of their value at any par-ticular uprating would be a charge on the contingency reserve.4. Following the general uprating in September 1971, the next review of benefits is due in 1973.Numbers of beneficiaries5. At present there are 7.6 million retirement pensioners; by the end of1975, because of increasing numbers of people over pension age and becauseof the assumed continuation in the trend towards earlier retirement, there areexpected to be 8.0 million. The number of children qualifying for family allowances will also continue to grow: there are 7.0 million at present and itis expected that there will be 7.4 million by the end of 1975. This increase is partly demographic and partly attributable to the raising of the minimumschool-leaving age in 1973-74. The upward trend in the rates of claim for sickness benefit which occurred for a number of years appears to have haltedfor the present, but in case this halt does not prove permanent it has been thought prudent to make allowance for a resumption of the upward trenduntil 1973-74, with a levelling off thereafter. The figures for unemploymentbenefit are not to be regarded as reflecting a forecast of the levels to whichunemployment will be reduced, and serve only to illustrate the direction ofGovernment policy.Increases and improvements6. The figures in Cmnd 4578 included estimates of the cost of variousreal improvements which had been announced and which were due to comeinto effect during 1971. These gave benefits to three of the groups most in need of special help: scaled down pensions for women widowed between the ages of 40 and 50 (from April 1971), and two new benefits   family income supplement for low wage earners with dependent children (from August1971), and attendance allowance for the very severely disabled (from Decem-ber 1971). The cost of these benefits in 1972-73, the first full year in whichthey will all be operative, is  32 million.7. Since Cmnd 4578 was published, there has been a general uprating ofthe main benefits. From 20 September 1971 the standard single rate of re-tirement pension was raised from  5 to  6 and corresponding improvementswere made in related benefits. The increase in retirement pension more thanrestored the value which the pension had following the previous general up-rating in November 1969 and provided a real improvement of about 3 per centin its purchasing power. At the same time further measures were introducedwhich develop the policy of special provision for those groups with a priorityclaim on national resources. These measures include: an old person&apos;s pension for all those aged 80 or over who do not already have a national insurance pen-sion; an age addition for all retirement pensioners aged 80 or over, and anincrease in the long-term addition for those aged 80 or over who are receiving a supplementary pension; and improvements in provision for the chronic sickThe cost of these special measures in 1972-73 is  43 million. In comparing the new totals of expenditure on social security with the figures in Cmnd4578, Table 2.17 shows separately the extra cost of the uprating in so far as this restored the value of benefits to what it was aften the previous uprating;the cost of the real improvement in the value of benefits and the cost ofthe selective improvements listed above are shown together under &quot;other changes&quot;.
&quot;Strategy for Pensions&quot;8. In September 1971 the Government published &quot;Strategy for Pensions&quot;(Cmnd 4755). The specific proposals in that document do not materiallyaffect expenditure during the period covered by the White Paper.FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATIONTABLE 2.18  million	1970-71	1971-72	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	provisional	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn					At 1971 Survey prices						Tax and rate collection	199-6	204-3	214-7	221-3	219	220Royal Mint (including decimali-						sation, etc.).........	5-5	2-2	0-4	1-6	2	post-war credits       ......	160	17-0	16-5	16-5	16	15Other financial administration,						etc.............	31-6	39-3	44-2	43-0	43	43Total......	252-7	262-8	275-8	282-4	280	280Changes from Cmnd 4578 re-						valued						policy changes      ......	 	+2-0	+ 10-1	+ 14-0	+ 12	estimating changes......	-4-2	+ 1-3	- 4-4	 	 	Cmnd 4578 revalued^)	256-9	259-5	270-1	268-4	268	(1) See Methodology, paragraph 5, page 00.Tax and rate collectionJust over half the total is in respect of the Inland Revenue, with smallersums for Customs and Excise, the Department of Health and Social Security,the Department of the Environment and local authorities. A substantial in-crease is required in the estimates for Customs and Excise to make allowance for the replacement of purchase tax by a value added tax. Additional staff required by the Inland Revenue to implement the revised National InsuranceScheme and the registration of labour-only sub-contractors will largely be off-set by the rundown of the Surtax Office. The estimates for the Department ofthe Environment includes provision for the staff of the Centralised Vehicleand Driving Licence project at Swansea.Royal MintThe estimates for the Royal Mint represent the cost of provision of normalUK coin requirements including in 1971-72 replacement of some LSD coinswhich were still in circulation at the beginning of the year; they also include expenditure (totalling  1.8m) on the equipping of Phase Two of the new Mintin South Wales replacing the Tower Hill Mint. Estimated building costs forthe completion of the new Mint, totalling  2.7m are included in the Accom-modation (Home) figures in Table 2.19.Other Financial administration the costs of the National Savings Department account for about half ofthe expenditure. This items also includes the cost of the Treasury, the costs of certain services, e.g. the note issue carried by the Bank of England for theTreasury, and the Bank of England capital expenditure.

Capital expenditure on major new works is now mainly confined to office accommodation for the Home Civil Service. Expenditure on most other types of buildings with specialised functions (eg museums and galleries,government training centres) is included in appropriate programmes else-where in the White Paper.2. The figures for policy changes since Cmnd 4578 include additional expenditure in assisted areas ( 0.7 million minor works and maintenance in1971-72); certain expenditure on higher courts and the provision of Judges&apos;lodgings which the Central Government has taken over from local authori-ties (expenditure on major new works is included in the Law and orderprogramme); and the provision of accommodation for Industrial Tribunalsrequired to implement the Industrial Relations Act. These additions, are,however more than offset by a postponement of expenditure on InlandRevenue computer buildings, as a result of the decision to review the tax system.
3. The main estimating change is an increase on rents to meet currentrequirements of the Civil Service. Some of these requirements arose fromchanges in Government policy, such as the offices needed to house staff work-ing on VAT, but it has not been possible to isolate the policy element.4. The expenditure forecasts relate to the need to maintain the existingestate to house current government activities and to the need to add to the estate, either by renting or building, to meet the development of these acti-vities, and the consequences of the relocation of activities and staff. the forecasts provide for some improvements to bring buildings up to agreed spaceand other standards but not for any raising of these standards. There is no provision for any substantial variation in the ratio of owned to leased accom-modation.5. Capital expenditure covers both new works (and associated site pur-chases) and furniture and equipment. The biggest and most variable items arethe individually large projects for computer centres and for headquartersoffices in major cities; these account for most of the rise in expenditureforecast. Included are computer centres for the Department of Health and social Security and the vehicle licensing and business statistics centres, and,towards the end of the period, for the Inland Revenue. New headquartersoffices are built to relocate staff, eg through dispersal, to replace sub-standardaccommodation, and to avoid expensive hirings. There are relatively stableexpenditures on new local office buildings, (about  3 million a year) on minornew works necessary to maintain or achieve agreed standards (about  7 mil-lion a year), and a more fluctuating expenditure on occupational services inleased buildings.6. The cost per square foot or cost per head of office buildings variesvery much depending on the size, nature, siting and location of each particularoffice. In the case of the relatively small and standardised local office build-ings it is possible to design with regard to a cost limit (at present  6.30 asquare foot gross, excluding site costs and non-standard features such aslifts and external works). Even here it is not possible to state a uniform cost per head because space requirements vary not only in relation to numbers and grades but because of the varying amounts of ancillary accommodationneeded, and planning difficulties. However the present cost limit indicates a figure of the order of  1,000 per head for building local offices.7. New furniture and equipment cost about  7-8 million a year for new buildings and replacements in existing buildings to provide or maintainagreed standards.8. The figures for Departmental administration cover the cost of admini-stering the accommodation services under this and other civil programmes.9. The forecast expenditure on rents includes the actual rents being paid for the existing estate plus an allowance for new hirings. At the end of 1970the estate included 29 million square feet net of office accommodation leasedat a total cost of about  29 million a year ie an average of  1 a square footnet. (As figures are at constant prices there is no allowance for increases inrents for current hirings as they fall due for renewal or renegotiation; it isthe forecast new hirings which account for the growth in the figures.) the forecasts are based on current estimates of staff numbers and plans for re-location or reorganisation. It takes account of the likely completion of newCrown building.
10. The figure for maintenance and other running costs, such as fuel, gas,electricity and water reflects, besides an expected increase in the size of the estate, the cost of bringing the estate up to standard and the greater use ofmore sophisticated machinery, plant and equipment. The total office estate is some 50 million square feet net, and there are in addition large areas of storage, laboratory and research premises and other specialised types ofbuilding.Stationery Office (Home)11. HM Stationery Office is the central source of supply for Governmentdepartments for their printing, stationery and office machinery, and it alsosupplies some other public sector bodies. The capital expenditure is mostlyon computers; the current estimates are higher than those in Cmnd 4578revalued following a review of future requirements. The Stationery office is also responsible for the printing, and in most cases the publication, distri-bution and sale of Government publications, on which the annual turnoveris some  5 million.Home publicity services12. This covers expenditure on publicity campaigns which are carriedout by the Central Office of Information for other Government departments,and which are directed principally at audiences in the United Kingdomthrough the media of press and television advertising, films and exhibitions.Related printing costs by Stationery Office are included. Expenditure for theDecimal Currency Board has now been completed but the figures allow for publicity for the Metrication Board and programmes for departments arisingfrom new legislation.MISCELLANEOUS services table 2.20   million	1970-71	1971-72	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	provisional	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn					At 1971 Survey prices						Records,   registrations  and						surveys       .........	17-0	22-7	15-2	14-3	14	14Broadcasting (capital expendi-						ture):						(i) BBC      .........	9-8	10-9	10-7	10-3	10	13(ii) ITA      .........	2-9	4-1	5-2	3-9	5	5Meteorological services	8-3	12-7	9-7	9-2	9	8Civil Defence.........	6-3	8-2	9-3	8-9	8	8Royal Parks, historic buildings						and ancient monuments^) ...	4-4	4-5	5-0	5-6	6	6-Other miscellaneous services ...	29-0	33-5	35-7	35-8	32	38Total.........	77-7	96-6	90-8	88-0	84	92Changes from Cmnd 4578 re-						valued						policy changes      ......	-0-1	4-2-1	4-2-7	4-7-1	-&apos;  	estimating changes......	-9-8	4-1-3	 	-0-9	-1	Cmnd 4578 revalued(2)	87-6	93-2	88-1	81-8	85	(1) Provision for grants to owners of historic buildings and for contributions to the redundant Churches Fund is included in money terms and not at constant prices.(2) See Notes on Methodology paragraph 5, page 00.
Records, Registrations and surveys. This includes expenditure by the Office of Population Censuses and surveys, General Register Office (Scotland), Land Registry, Ordnance Survey,and other minor Departments, as well as a smaller proportion of localauthority expenditure. Provision is made under the Office of population censuses and Surveys for the social surveys, carried out as an allied service for Government Departments.2. Expenditure diminishes sharply after 1971-72 on the completion ofthe 1971 Census.Broadcasting (capital expenditure)3. Expenditure covers the capital requirements of the British Broad-casting Corporation (home services) and the Independent Television Authority.The Corporation and the Authority are co-ordinating separately financed pro-grammes for the construction of UHF stations to transmit BBC 1 and 2, andITV services on 625 lines (black and white and colour). The aim is to in-crease the present coverage attained by the UHF stations from about 80%to well over 90% by the end of 1975. The Corporation^ expenditure (capital and current) is financed by Government grant which at present consists ofthe whole of the net income from licence revenue. The Authority providestransmitters to broadcast the programmes of independent television com-panies and is financed by the rentals charged to those companies.Meteorological Services4. This covers the cost of services provided for both defence and civil purposes. These estimates are also included in the Defence Budget (Table 2.1)and an equivalent reduction is made in Other military defence (Table 2.2) toenable the item to be shown here. The figure for 1971-72 reflects the pur-chase of a computer.Civil Defence5. The Home Secretary announced in Parliament on 5 August 1971 the broad conclusions of the recent Home Defence Review. Expenditure on civil defence will continue at the present level. The state of preparedness will be improved by adjustments between individual items in the programme. Thelocal authority planning machinery will be developed, taking into account theproposals for local government re-organisation.Royal Parks, historic buildings and ancient monuments, etc.6. This item now includes expenditure on Royal Palaces as well as thaton Royal Parks, ancient monuments, grants to historic buildings and other services. As announced in Parliament in June 1971 there is to be an increasein the amount of expenditure on grants to owners of historic buildings; thisis mainly reflected in the estimates for later years. Expenditure expected to result from the proposals to take powers to make grants to owners of fieldmonuments is also included for the first time; this is estimated to reach  0.15million a year by 1975-76. As in Cmnd 4578 provision is made for risingexpenditure on ancient monuments; this is needed to cover the increasing loadof work, shown for example by the scheduling of some 400 additional monu-ments as worthy of preservation each year and covers such items as an in-crease in the number of monuments in guardianship, and additional emer-gency excavations prior to the development of sites.
Other Miscellaneous services. About 40 per cent of the amounts shown in Table 2.20 for the 5 years to 1975-76 relate to net lending and investment overseas by Cable and Wire-less Ltd, which is Government owned, and which provides important linksin the Commonwealth telecommunications system.The remainder represents expenditure by the Civil Service Department, theCabinet Office, the Public Trustee, salaries and administration costs of theMinistry of Posts and Telecommunications, Civil List annuities and pensionsless receipts of  4.2 million in respect of the net estimated proceeds of dis-posal of the assets of the State Management Districts of Carlisle, Gretna andCromarty.NORTHERN IRELANDTABLE 2.21   million	1970-71 provisional outturn	1971-72 estimate	1972-73 estimate	1973-74 estimate	1974-75 estimate	1975-76 estimate at 1971 Survey prices Northern Ireland      ......	500-2	546-0	566-6	567-3	577	581Changes from Cmnd 4578 re-valued policy changes      ...... estimating changes......

These estimates of public expenditure are prepared by the NorthernIreland departments and refer only to those services in Ulster for which theNorthern Ireland Government is responsible. Expenditure by WestminsterGovernment departments in Northern Ireland on such items as defence and agricultural support is contained within the relevant United Kingdom pro-grammes.2. The expenditure is not subject to detailed control from Westminster.But the overall level is customarily subject to agreement between the twoGovernments and is determined on the basis of parity of services between northern Ireland and Great Britain. However, expenditure on assistance to in-dustry and employment is determined in relation to the special needs of Ulster;and that on law and order reflects the present disturbed conditions. while these conditions continue the forecasts of expenditure may be particularlyliable to change.3. By comparison with Cmnd 4578 the estimate for 1970-71 has been revised downwards by  23 million. In the current and future years the esti-mating changes reflect mainly the recalculation of expenditure on law andorder, higher than expected expenditure on employment and industry, increased provision for investment in electricity generation and a recosting of supple-mentary benefits in the light of the recent trend of unemployment.4. Policy changes reflect decisions by the Northern Ireland Government.These include the change in the system of investment incentives to industryannounced in the Northern Ireland Parliament last February and an increasein social security rates following similar increases in Great Britain. There isalso provision in 1971-72 for expenditure in connection with the Harland &amp;Wolff shipyard.

(1) Forestry Commission expenditure is not included.1. Table 2.22 provides separate figures relating by central government,local authorities and public corporations on services in Scotland within theSecretary of State&apos;s field of responsibility. Table 2.33 gives forecasts of allcurrent and capital expenditure of Scottish local authorities, including asmall amount within the field of responsibility of departments other thanthe Scottish office. These figures are at 1971 Survey prices, and do not include a provision for the relative price effect.2. In total the forecasts provide for an average annual increase of about\ per cent between 1971-72 and 1975-76 in expenditure on services withinthe Secretary of State&apos;s field. The trends of expenditure in the various pro-grammes are explained in earlier chapters of this White Paper. The Scottishfigures are affected particularly by the policy of introducing import levies toreduce the need for deficiency payments to farmers; by a fluctuating pattern of expenditure on new electricity generating stations; and by the inclusion in Table 2.23 is an average annual rate of 3.2 per cent between the current 60 million under the additional works programme announced by the Secre-tary of State on 13 July 1971.3. Subject to the provisional nature of figures of local authorities&apos; cur-rent expenditure in advance of further settlements of rate support grant, theincrease in expenditure by Scottish local authorities (i.e. excluding rate borneexpenditure on housing which is not reckonable for this grant) which is impliedin Table 2.23 is an average annual raate of 3.2 per cent between the current year and 1975-76. For their capital expenditure, the corresponding annual rate is 3.8 per cent.

Table 2.24 provides separate expenditure figures relating to services in Wales forwhich the Welsh Office are responsible, directly or indirectly (e.g. expenditure by localauthorities). Table 2.25 gives forecasts of all current and capital expenditure of Welshlocal authorities, including expenditures for which Departments other than the welsh office are responsible (in particular the Department of Education and Science, asregards further education, and the Home Office).2. Expenditure within the Secretary of State&apos;s responsibility is estimated to rise between1971-72 and 1975-76 at an average annual rate of about 3 per cent. The programmes for 1971-72, 1972-73 and 1973-74 include expenditure of about  18 million underthe additional works programme announced on 14 July 1971, and thus increase thecapital programmes including those of the Welsh local authorities for those years.3. Subject to future settlements of rate support grant, the provisional programmes oflocal authorities&apos; current expenditure in Wales will be rising at an average annual rateof 4 per cent between 1971-72 and 1975-76.\

NOTES ON METHODOLOGY1. The definitions, classifications and methods of calculating and express-ing price adjustments, including the relative price effect, are the same in this white Paper as in Cmnd 4578, except as explained in the following para-graphs. The Government intend to publish separately a comprehensive hand-book, which will be kept up to date, on the statistical methodology of the series of annual White Papers.Classification2. In consequence of changes in the machinery of government expendi-tures on certain services have been transferred between programmes:(a) Civil aviation services and shipping services from &quot;Surface transport&quot;to &quot; Trade, industry and employment &quot;.(b) Road Research Laboratory from &quot;Roads&quot; to &quot;Surface transport&quot;.(c) Child care in England and Wales and social work in Scotland from&quot;Law and order&quot; to &quot;Health and personal social services&quot;.(d) Education of mentally handicapped children in England and Walesfrom &quot;Health and personal social services&quot; to &quot;Education&quot;.(e) The cost of buildings with specialised functions from &quot;common services &quot; to the relevant programmes.3.   Other classification changes are:(a) Special defence aid to Malaysia and Singapore from &quot;Overseas aid&quot;to &quot;Other military defence&quot;.(b) Rents of supplementary benefit documents from &quot;Social security&quot; to&quot;Housing&quot;.4. In recognition that social as much as financial criteria are taken intoaccount in determining capital expenditure on the London and South-Eastcommuter network, the whole of this now appears under &quot;Surface transport&quot;as infrastructure expenditure. In addition, expenditure on urban and subur-ban rolling stock and signalling equipment has been brought within thescope of the grants provided for expenditure on projects to assist public transport in commuter areas, and also appears under infrastructure. Corre-sponding reductions have been made from &quot;Nationalised industries&apos; capitalexpenditure&quot; and from &quot;other passenger transport&quot; within the &quot;surface transport&quot; programme.5. The following items have been brought into the total of public expen-diture for the first time in this series of White Papers:(a) Capital expenditure by Cable and Wireless Ltd. (Miscellaneousservices)(b) Capital expenditure by the Bank of England. (Financial administra-tion)(c) Note issue expenses of the Bank of England. (Financial administra-tion(d) Net lending by local authority in England for council house purchase by council tenants (Housing).They add the following amounts to public expenditure:  million at 1971 Survey prices1970-71        1971-72        1972-73        1973-74        1974-75        1975-7637 58 69 63 57 616. As has been explained in paragraph 21 of Part 1 of this White Paper,the treatment of public sector receipts in the national income accounts and
in these White Papers has been reviewed. At the end of these Notes is alist of the main receipts now classified as charges. The effect of this reclassi-fication of receipts on public expenditure is:  million at 1971 Survey prices1970-71 1971-72        1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-76-42 -50 -52 -54 -56 -58Outturn, 1968-69-1970-71 (see Part I, paragraph 27, and tables 3.23 and 3.24)7. The figures for 1969-70 and 1970-71 were prepared at 1971 survey prices as well as at outturn prices. The former are shown in table 3.23; thelatter are converted to a series at 1971-72 outturn prices, adjusted for the rela-tive price effect, by applying the movement in GDP prices over the relevantperiod, and shown in Table 3.24 together with figures for 1968-69 calcu-lated in the same way. Figures for 1968-69 at 1971 Survey prices have beenprepared by first converting from outturn to 1969-70 prices and then using the price movements appropriate to the 1969-70 figures.Price adjustments8. Tables 3.10 to 3.15 show certain categories of receipts allocated toprogrammes, with the relative price effect attributed. These receipts are estimated at outurn prices in the first instance. They had been converted to constant prices by the same method as estimates of expenditure whichare expressed in cash.9. The estimates of expenditure on the overseas aid programme are expressed at 1971-72 outturn prices, but are now measured directly on thisconstant price basis and do not, as hitherto, represent a deflation of cashestimates (see paragraph 1 of section 3 of Part 2). In the housing programme the deflation to constant prices of the cash estimates of current grants to persons and subsidies is now embodied in the constant price estimates shown for that programme in all the relevant tables and no longer forms part ofthe item &quot;Adjustments to 1971-72 outturn prices and relative price effect&quot;.10. The item &quot; Price adjustments&quot; in those tables in which the relative price effect and other adjustments have been attributed to programmes orother categories of expenditure includes these adjustments only in respectof the Overseas aid and Social security programmes.Analysis of adjustments11. The following table analyses the figures in the line &quot;Adjustments to1971-72 outturn prices and relative price effect&quot; into their three constituent parts for the years 1970-71 to 1975-76:TABLE A   million	1970-71	1971-72	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	provisional	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn					1.

annex the previous Administration presented in the firstWhits Paper of this series  (Cmnd &apos;i23^) a summary table(1.2) of public sector transactions.2.      That table did two things;i. by giving revenue projections  (with existingtax rates), it provided a means of taking intoaccount the revenue generated directly by the expen-diture programmes themselves  (eg income tax on family allowances) which tends to offset the effect of that expenditure on demand;ii. by distinguishing expenditure in three broadcategories with unquantified but broadly differentimplications in terms of demand, it sought to help towards an understanding of the effects of the ex-penditure on demand.The table also struck a balance between the two sides ofthe account and so proported to give a picture of the neteffect of public sector transactions.    This    balance was liable to be seriously misleading as an indicator of thefuture place of the public sector in the economy and so the table was discarded from our last White Paper (Cmnd3.      The present draft embodies in paragraph 8 a way of expressing the effects of public expenditure, whatever formsit takes,  in terms of demand on net output.    This -a. takes account directly of, amongst other things,the flow back of tax generated by the expenditure,as in i.  above, but without requiring any calcu-lation or projection of total revenue;    and b. expresses directly the demand effects of the4578).
expenditures in a form of measurement appli-cable to them all.4.      In both respects the new presentation is inprinciple an improvement on that of our predecessors.Moreover, by providing - as the discarded presentationdid not - at least a rough indication of the rate atwhich public expenditure will be expanding its claim on the nation&apos;s resources, it enables us to demonstrate that our programmes at their present levels are not likely to put increasing pressure on other claimants.15th November 1971
