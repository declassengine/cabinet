ANNEX APROPOSALS FOR A SETTLEMENTI.     THE TEST OF ACCEPTABILITYThe proposals set out &quot;below are conditional upon the British government being satisfied that they are acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as awhole.     The British Government will therefore appoint a Commission toascertain directly from all sections of the population of Rhodesia whetheror not these proposals are acceptable and to report accordingly to theBritish Government.     It will consist of a Chairman, Deputy Chairmen and anumber of Commissioners.     The report will be signed by the Chairman andthe Deputy Chairmen.     The members of the Commission will travel extensivelythroughout the country visiting in particular all [main] centres of population, local councils and traditional meeting places in the TribalTrust Lands.In the period before and during the test of acceptability normal political activities will be permitted to the satisfaction of the Commission, provided they are conducted in a peaceful and democratic manner.     Radio and television time will be made available to political parties represented inthe House of Assembly.The Commission will carry out its enquiries in public or in private as itdeems appropriate.     There will be immunity for witnesses heard by theCommission in respect of their evidence and freedom for persons resident in rhodesia, whatever their political views or affiliations, to enable them to appear before the Commission.     All Rhodesian Government employees will be permitted to express their views to the Commission.     Persons in detentionor under restriction will be similarly permitted.    Arrangements will bemade in London and elsewhere as necessary for Rhodesians resident abroad to submit their views to the Commission.The Rhodesian Government will provide the Commission with such assistance asmay reasonably be required to enable them to carry out their functions.1
II.     TEE constitution the Constitution of Rhodesia will he the Constitution adopted in Rhodesiain 1969 modified in the following respects.     The Rhodesian Governmentwill introduce legislation to make the necessary modifications in theConstitution and related electoral legislation with effect from the date on which independence is conferred by the British Parliament.(1)     The House of Assemblya. The existing provisions governing the increase of African represen-\         tation in the House will be repealed and replaced by provisions to giveeffect to the arrangements set out in the following sub-paragraphs.b. A new roll of African voters (the African higher roll) will be created with the same qualifications as those for the roll ofEuropean voters.     The relevant means and educational qualificationsare set out in Appendix I.Cm     Additional seats will he created, in accordance with the arrange-ments set out in the following sub-paragraphs, with effect from the dissolution of Parliament following the date on which it is established that any such seats are due.    The seats will be filled at the generalelection consequent upon the dissolution of Parliament.   However, thefirst four additional seats will be created and elections held to fillthem as soon as it is established that they are due.d.     When the number of voters registered on the African higher rollequals 6 per cent of the number of voters then registered on theEuropean roll, two additional African seats will become due:   when thenumber of voters registered on the African higher roll equals 12 percent of the number of voters then registered on the European roll, afurther two additional African seats will become due5   further additionalAfrican seats will become due, two at a time, for each such proportionate increase of 6 per cent in the number of voters registered on the african higher roll, until 34 additional African seats have been created, thus resulting in parity in the numbers of African and european members in the House of Assembly.     This arrangement will ensure that at parity there are approximately equal numbers of voterson the African higher and European rolls.2
e0     The first two additional African seats will he filled by directelection for single-member constituencies by the voters registered onthe African higher roll and the next two will be filled by indirectelection by electoral colleges on the same basis as the existing eightAfrican seats filled by indirect election.     This sequence will be repeated in relation to subsequent additional African seats.f. For the purpose of giving effect to the above arrangement the registrar-General of Voters will review the number registered on the african higher roll and the European roll at not more than six-monthly intervals, and whenever additional African seats have become due hewill issue a certificate to that effect to the President and thePresident will then be required to make an order providing for thecreation of those seats as described above.g. The qualifications for the existing roll of African voters (the african lower roll) will be replaced by qualifications equivalent tothose for the &quot;B&quot; roll under the 1961 Constitution subject to thefinancial qualifications being increased twice by 10 per cent.     the relevant means and educational qualifications are set out in Appendix II.h. The Rhodesian Government have agreed to a simplified applicationform for enrolment on the African lower roll and to an amendment tothe electoral act to provide that an applicant shall, if he so requires,receive assisfcanoe from the Registering Officer in completing theform.i. A candidate for election to an African higher roll seat will haveto be registered as a voter on that roll, and a candidate for election to an African lower roll seat tvill have to be registered as a voter on one of the two African rolls.j.     Within one year after the holding of the general election atwhich parity is attained a referendum will be held among all enrolledAfrican voters to determine whether or not the seats filled byindirect election should be abolished and replaced by an equal numberof seats filled by direct electiono3Si.^HET
The new seats will all he African higher roll seats unless the Legislaturehas before the referendum provided for up to one-quarter of the new seats to be African lower roll seats.     The Legislature may also provide that a specific number of the extra seats should be rural constituencies.Laws providing for any of the matters mentioned in this paragraph,including the procedural arrangements for the holding of the referendum,would not have to be passed in accordance with the requirements for amending the Constitution   the only special requirement would be thatin the House of Assembly they must be approved by a majority of all the african members.If the   majority of voters at the referendum is in favour of the abolitionof the indirectly elected seats, an election to give effect to the change will be held within one year thereafter.     It will be possible for an election to be held for this purpose without the dissolution of Parliament.If this course is adopted the indirectly elected African members and the african higher roll members and also, if the number of African lower Roll seats is to be increased, the African lower roll members, will vacatetheir seats on the date appointed for the nomination of candidates in theelection and Parliament will be prorogued from that date until thecompletion of the election.ke     Not later than 6 months after the holding of that election or, ifthe result of the referendum is that the seats filled by indirect electionare retained, after the completion of the referendum, an independentcommission will be appointed to ascertain whether the creation of common roll seats in accordance with the constitutional provisions described in sub-paragraph 1. below is acceptable to the people of Rhoderia and, ifthis is not so acceptable, whether any alternative arrangements would command general support.     The commission will consist of a Chairman whoholds or has held high judicial office, and equal numbers of European and African members appointed   by the Government after consultation with all parties represented in the House of Assembly.     The Commission will berequired to report to the Legislature within one year of its appointment.A law to give effect to any recommendation of the commission would haveto be passed in accordance with the requirements for the amendment of theConstitution.4
1.     The Constitution will provide that, with effect from the dissolution of Parliament following the date by which the Commission is required toreport, 10 Common Roll seats in the House of Assembly will be created.The Common Roll seats will be filled by direct election by the voters ona roll consisting of all the voters for the time being registered on theEuropean roll and the African higher roll.     Elections to these seats willbe conducted on the basis that the whole of Rhodesia will form a singleconstituency returning all the Common Roll members, and that each voterwill have 10 votes which he may cast as he chooses amongst the candidates.(2)     The SenateThe Senate will continue to be constituted as at present.     As a consequence ofthe establishment (see paragraph 3. below) of a new Declaration of Rightsenforceable by the courts the Senate Legal Committee will be abolished.(3)    The Declaration of rights the existing Declaration of Rights will be replaced by a new Declarationaffording protection to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual and conferring a right of access to the High Court for the purpose ofobtaining redress on any person who alleges that its provisions have beencontravened in relation to him.     The text of the Declaration and theprovisions for its enforcement are set out in Appendix III.(4)    Renewal of Declarations of EmergencySection 61 of the Constitution will be amended so as to reduce the period within which a Declaration of Emergency requires renewal by resolution ofthe House of Assembly from 12 months to 9 months.(5)     Amendment of the Constitutiona.     The Rhodesian Government have given an assurance to the BritishGovernment that they will not introduce or&apos; support in the RhodesianParliament any amendment of the specially entrenched provisions of theConstitution relating to the composition of the House of Assembly orthe specially entrenched provisions of the Electoral Act until the first two African higher roll seats have been created and filled or untilthree years have elapsed since the Constitutional changes provided forby these proposals have come into force, whichever is the sooner.5*3 &amp;. ^ fri iL, B
b. Until the date by which the Commission referred to in sub-paragraph 1. k. above is required to report, or the date on which itreports if that is earlier, a Bill to amend any of the specially entrenched provisions of the Constitution will require, in addition tothe existing requirements of the affirmation votes in each House of theLegislature of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of theHouse, the affirmative votes in the House of Assembly of a majority ofthe total European membership and of a majority of the total Africanmembership.c. The existing provision to the effect that a Bill to increase thenumber of members of the House of Assembly without altering the propor-tion of African members to the total number of members shall not on that account be regarded as amending a specially entrenched provision willbe repealed.do     The specially entrenched provisions of the Constitution will include -i. The new provisions to give effect to the proposals inparagraph II (1) above;ii. The new Declaration of Rights, including the provisions for itsenforcement by the High Courtjiii. The amended Section 61 relating to Declarations of Emergency,e.     The following provisions of the Electoral Act will be subject to thesame requirements as regards amendment as the specially entrenchedprovisions of the Constitution.i. Those prescribing the qualifications and disqualifications for registration of voters on the European roll and both African rollsjii. Those prescribing the qua-lifications and disqualifications forcandidates for election to the House of Assemblyjiii. The provision for variation of the means qualifications forvoters in consequence of changes in prices   andiv. The provisions prescribing the composition of the TribalElectoral Colleges.Section 26 of the Electoral Act, which provides for the gradual increaseof means and educational qualifications for the existing African roll sothat, when parity is reached, they are the same as those for the Europecnroll, will be repealed.6SECRET
III. REVIEW OP EXISTING legislation the Rhodesian Government have intimated to the British Government theirfirm intention, within the spirit of these proposals, to make progress towards ending racial discrimination.   Accordingly an independentcommission will &quot;be set up to examine the question of racial discrimination.It will be required to consider existing legislation and to make recommendations to the Rhodesian Government on ways of making progress towards ending any racial discrimination.   There shall be included inthe functions of the commission a special duty to scrutinise theprovisions of the Land Tenure Act and to consider the possible creationof an independent and permanent Land Board to preside over the long-termresolutions of the problems involved.   The terms of reference which will consist of 3 members, one of whom will be an African, are set out inAppendix IV.   Its membership will be agreed with the British Government,The Commission will be established as soon as possible after the test of acceptability has been completed.   Its findings will be published.The Rhodesian Government recognise that the findings of the commission will carry special authority and have given an assurance that they willcommend to Parliament such changes in existing legislation as arerequired to give effect to its recommendations^ subject only toconsiderations that any Government would be obliged to regard as of anoverriding character.IV. REVIEW OP CASES OP DETAINEES AND RESTRICTEESThe Rhodesian Government stated that 23 detainees have been releasedsince the end of March 1971? leaving 93 detainees and 2 restrictees(excluding 34 detainees who have been released on conditions).   It isthe Rhodesian Governments intention to release a further 31 detainees assoon as the necessary arrangements can be made.Since the settlement will have created a new situation there will bea new special review of the cases of all detainees and restricteesto see whether, in the light of changed circumstances, they can be released or the restrictions can be removed without prejudice to themaintenance of public safety and public order.   This review will becarried out by the existing tribunal, of which the Chairman is a Judge7
of the Rhodesian High Court, as soon as possible after the test of acceptability has been completed.   The recommendations of the tribunalwill be binding on the detaining or restricting authority.   For thepurposes of this special review an observer appointed by the BritishGovernment in agreement with the Rhodesian Government will be entitledto be present,V.     LAUDIn the African area there is at present approximately 5 million acres of unoccupied land which is available for settlement by Africans,3 and a half million in the Tribal Trust Lands and 1 and a half million in the purchase area.   Provision exists under which significant additional land can be made available and the Rhodesian Government intend to makeit available as the need arises.Both Governments agree that they will immediately devote proportionof the aid referred to in paragraph VI of these proposals intended for occupation by Africans,With the exception of certain forest and national park areas thedevelopment of which .may involve the removal of a limited number ofoccupants without established rights, the only 2 cases in which the rhodesian Government are considering the eviction of Africans from landin the European area are Epworth and Chishawasha Missions.   the rhodesian Government have given an assurance that they will not take steps to evict African tenants or other occupants from these 2 areasor from other areas in which they are living until such time as thecommission referred to in paragraph III above has reported and its recommendations have been fully considered.VT.   DEVELOPMENT programme the 2 Governments attach the greatest importance to the expansionof the economy of Rhodesia and, in particular, to stimulating economic growth in the Tribal Trust Lands.   There will therefore be a development programme to increase significantly educational and job opportunities for Africans in order to enable them to play a growing part in thecountry&apos;s future development, and early discussions between the 2Governments will be held to agree on this programme and the best means of implementing it.8
The British Government will provide up to  5 million per year for aperiod of 10 years in capital aid and technical assistance to heapplied to purposes and projects to be agreed with the Rhodesian Governmentto he matched appropriately by sums provided by the Rhodesian Governmentfor this development programme.   This will be in addition to the annual expenditure currently planned by the Rhodesian Government for Africaneducation and housing and for development projects in the Tribal TrustLands and African Purchase Areas.   Part of this development programme will be devoted to the establishment of new irrigation schemes, intensivecultivation projects and the improvement of communications and industrialprojects in the Tribal Trust Lands and African Purchase Areas.   Asregards education, the moneys will be used to improve and expandfacilities for Africans in agriculture, technical and vocational training,teacher training and training in administration and for other educationalpurposes in the field of primary, secondary and higher education.The parallel development of the 2 elements in this programme will thushelp to ensure that new job opportunities for Africans will become available as the economy expands and additional educational facilities are provided for them.VII, OTHER MATTERS1.     As vacancies occur in the Rhodesian Public Service they will be filled according to the criteria of merit and suitability, regardless of race.   The Rhodesian Government have undertaken to take steps toenable an increasing number of Africans to fit themselves to competeon equal terms with candidates of other races so far as appointmentsor promotions are concerned.2.    Rhodesian citizens who have left Rhodesia for any reason will beallowed to return freely and without being subjected to any restrictionsby reason of their past activities, but without amnesty in respect ofany criminal offence,3.     The Rhodesian Government wish to revoke the state of emergencyat the earliest opportunity.   In the absence of unforeseen circumstancesthey will do so after sanctions against Rhodesia have been lifted.
VIII. IMPLEMENTATIONAs soon as the British Government are satisfied that the legislation referredto in paragraph II above has been enacted and steps taken to give effectto the proposals in paragraphs III and IV above they will introduce legislation to confer independence on Rhodesia as a republic and will commend this legislation to the British Parliament.     They will also terminate their economic and other sanctions when this legislation takes effect.     both governments will take steps to settle outstanding financial and other issues and to regularise relations between the 2 countries.V V V V/ VNothing in these proposals shall be regarded as implying any change in thecurrent attitude of either side to the present status of Rhodesia or of the1969 Constitution.The above proposals are acceptable to the British and the rhodesian government.10SECRET
ANNEX BPROPOSALS FOR A SETTLEMENT MEASURED AGAINST THEFIVE PRINCIPLESA   THE FIRST PRINCIPLE.    (The Principle of unimpeded progress to majority rule would have to be maintained and guaranteed).1. The 1969 Constitution expressly precludes the Africans from everattaining more than parity of representation with the Europeans, and then only in the remote future.    Under the proposed terms, these provisionswill be repealed and replaced by arrangements whereby the Africans will proceed (within a generation or so, although no precise timescale can begiven because cf all the unpredictable factors) to parity of representation in the House of Assembly.    Additional seats will be created, the first four at an early stage and before the next General Election (which mightnot be until 1975), as the number of voters registered on a new HigherAfrican Roll (with the same franchise qualifications as the European Roll)increases.    These arrangements will ensure that when parity is reachedthe number of voters on the Higher African and the European Rolls will be approximately equal,2,        The transition to majority rule will be achieved by the creation of10 additional Common Roll seats at the first election after parity is reached.As the number of African voters on this Roll increases bo the Africans willwin a majority of these 10 seats.3.        Progress to majority rule Is unimpeded in the sense that Africanadvance Is inexorably linked to the numbers qualifying for the HigherAfrican Roll and is guaranteed in that all the relevant Constitutionalprovisions are specially entrenched and subject to the procedure for amending such provisions (see paragraphs 4 and 5 below).    TheCommission to be held at parity does not affect these arrangements;any recommendations it may make to vary the arrangements written Intothe Constitution for the creation of the Common Roll seats will be subjectto the normal safeguard against amendment to the specially entrenchedprovisions of the Constitution.B   THE SECOND PRINCIPLE.    (There will have to be guarantees againstretrogressive amendment of the Constitution).4.        At all stages in the progress to majority rule it will be necessaryto obtain the approval of a substantial proportion of the african representatives in the House of Assembly for any amendment tothe specially entrenched provisions In the Constitutions, which include all the arrangements for African political advance.    Moreover, an assurance has been given that no constitutional amendment will be proposed until after the first two additional African seats have been1
filled, or until three years have elapsed whichever is sooner.    Thisconstitutes absolute protection during the period when the Africans havethe smallest number of members and are therefore most vulnerable.The constitutional position until parity is reached will be that suchamendments must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the total membership in each House and a simple majority in the House of Assemblyof each main racial group (European and African) of its members votingseparately.    This means that even if all the indirectly elected Africanswere to vote for such an amendment (and so far they have shown noinclination to support the Government on issues where African interests are in dispute), one of the directly elected Africans would have to vote thesame way to give the necessary simple majority of all the Africans in theHouse cf Assembly,   Thus at all times the directly elected members(until the position at 5 below is reached) will be in a position to preventretrogressive amendment of the Constitution.5. The dropping of the requirement for separate racial majorities atparity will not essentially weaken the safeguard.    At this stage the europeans will have to obtain the support of at least 17 Africans forany amendment of a specially entrenched matter; and these 17 Africanswill by this stage, either all be directly elected or their status as indirectlyelected representatives will have been endorsed by the prior referendum ofall Africans on the two African electoral Rolls on the future of the indirectlyelected seats.C   THE THIRD PRINCIPLE.    (There would have to be immediateimprovement in the political status of the African population).6. The Africans can look forward to some additional representation in the House cf Assembly at an early stage since elections for the first twoHigher African Roll seats are to be held as soon as the necessaryregistration and electoral formalities have been completed.    similarly the first two additional indirectly elected seats will be filled as soon asthey have been earned by Higher African Roll registrations a7. The extension of the franchise qualifications for the Lower AfricanRoll will enfranchise a large number of additional Africans (we estimatebetween 250, 000 and 350s 000).    The new qualifications are the same asthose which applied to the *B* Roll under the 1961 Constitution, subject tothe financial qualifications being increased twice by 10 per cent to take account of inflation since 1961P in accordance with the provisions of the electoral law,8. The provision of substantial funds for development will promoteAfrican political advance.    Our programme of aid for Improving the educational facilities for Africans and developing the Tribal Trust Lands -and thereby the employment opportunities available for Africans -* will ensure that the rate at which additional Africans attain the income and educational qualifications required for the franchise will be accelerated.2
9. Also, the greater protection of fundamental rights and freedomsafforded to the Africans by the strenthened and justiciable Declaration of rights constitutes an Improvement in their political status.    Similarly,the Rhodesians1 promise to end the state of emergency, the release ofsome of the detainees and a special review of those remaining., representgeneral improvements in the conditions of the Africans,D   THE FOURTH PRINCIPLE.    (There would have to be progress towardsending racial discrimiax&amp;tlon).10,       There will be an independent Commission consisting of three members (one of whom must be an African) and or whose compositionwe are to be consulted to examine the problem of racial discrimination.It will be required to consider existing legislation, with special referenceto both the educational system and the Land Tenure Act, and to make recommendations on ways of making progress towards ending racial discrimination.    The Rhodesian statement of firm Intention to work towards ending discrimination and their assurance that they will commendthe Commissions findings to their Parliament (subject only to consldera-tions that any Government would regard as of an over-riding character) addsweight to this aspect of our proposals for dealing with the problem.11.        The provisions in the Declaration of Rights dealing withdiscrimination are the same as those contained in the 1961 Declarationof Rights and will effectively prevent any Increase in discrimination,Any legislation containing discriminatory provisions, or any administrativeacts under such legislation which are discriminatory in effect, may bechallengeable in the courts.    If the court rules that such legislationcontravenes the Declaration then they have power to nullify it.12,       In addition to the review of the Land Tenure Act, the Rhodesianshave agreed to make a substantial quantity of land, which is at presentunoccupied, available for African settlement^ as the need arises.    further evidence of the RhodesiansT good intentions on this emotive issue isprovided by their assurance that they will not evict Africans living atthe two Missions at present threatened with plans for resettlement, orfrom other areas of African occupation- until such time as the commission has reported and its recommendations have been fully considered,13.       A number of peripheral matters including the special review of theremaining detainees;  the falling away of emergency powers with the eventual lifting of the state of emergency? the amnesty to be granted toRhodesians returning to the country and the undertaking to encourage theemployment of Africans in the Public Service- also fall to some extentunder this Principle,3
E    THE FIFTH PRINCIPLE.    (The British Government would need to besatisfied that any basis proposed for independence was acceptable tothe Rhodesian people as a whole).14.        In accordance with the requirement of this PrincipleP the last wordon the acceptability of any settlement is to lie with the Rhodesian people themselves.    Provision has been made for the appointment of aCommission, to be headed by a senior member of the Judiciary, to carryout a thorough and impartial test of opinion throughout the length andbreadth of Rhodesia.    Every effort will be made to ensure that allRhodesian Africans understand the proposed terms and that they will begiven ample opportunity to express their views.    Consultation will not be confined to Chiefs and anyone who wishes will be able to give evidence,including those still held in detention.    Facilities will be provided forexpression of views on the media and normal political activities are to beallowed to all areas before and during the test of acceptability.24 November 1971
