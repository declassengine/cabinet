The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of      W................................TOP SECRET,   % Copy No............w ACP(71)13821 November 1971CABINETRHODESIAN negotiations memorandum by the Solicitor GeneralReports from the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary in Salisbury showthat further progress has been made towards narrowing the gap betweenthe British and rhodesian positions and that, by and large, anagreement concluded at the present stage would adequately satisfy the Second (no retrogression), Third (immediate improvement in thepolitical status of Africans) and Fifth (test of acceptability)Principles.     But serious gaps remain in the way of satisfaction ofthe First and Fourth Principles.     A summary of the main points under negotiation, and their importance to the four relevant Principlesia at Annex A.FIRST ELINCIPLE2.     As to the First Principle (unimpeded progress to majority rule)the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary is pressing for agreement tothe creation, after parity, of 10 Common Roll seats.     It is bywinning a majority of these that the Africans would eventually achievemajority rule.     It is therefore disappointing that, in the view ofthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, it may be necessary, if asettlement is to be made, to make concessions both on the number of seats and on the method of election of members to fill them.3,     The Rhodesians offered 6 Common Roll seats; we asked for 10;and the Cabinet have already agreed that the Foreign and commonwealth secretary may settle for 80     He has suggested, from Salisbury, analternative compromise arrangement whereby, at the first electionafter parity 6 seats would be created, this number being increasedto 10 at the second and subsequent elections.     The difficulty forus in this is that it would appear that majority rule v/as being delayedeven longer than is already to be the case.1
4,     The Rhodesians have agreed that the country will form a singleconstituency for the purposes of election to the Common Roll seats.But they have rejected, proportional representation, which we favoured,as &quot;being too difficult for Rhodesians to understand; and they are pressing hard for a system under which a voter would he free to castmore than one of his votes (as many as there are seats to he filled)for a single candidate.     This would strongly favour the larger,better organised parties, and would enable the White Ehodesians to delay majority rule for a number of years,5,     The Cabinet may wish to give careful consideration to other aspectsof the proposed settlement before deciding that it would be proper to approve concessions on the Common Roll election,FOURTH PRINCIPLE6.     The essence of the anti-discrimination guarantee in the 1961Constitution (Section 67:    see Annex B) wasa, discriminatory laws and executive acts were generallyprohibited;b, there was a broad exception (based mainly on criteria ofspecial circumstances related to the stage of social andeconomic development reached by the races);c, but this exception excluded any increased measures of discrimination;d, discrimination under laws existing in I96I was not opento challenge.7,     Under Smith&apos;s 19^9 &quot;Constitution&quot; guarantees against discriminationceased to be justiciable.     The regime introduced and are continuing to implement measures which increase discrimination (notably in relationto land).2
8.    We have now reached agreement with Smith on the following points:1,     an independent Review Commission (membership, including an african, to &quot;be agreed with us) will consider existing legislation and recommend to the Rhodesian Government ways of progress towardsending discrimination.     The Rhodesian Government will have seriousregard to the findings of the Commission and make such changes asthey deem appropriate;ii. the Declaration of Rights (now modified in detail so as tobe acceptable except on the important points mentioned below)willa,     once again be justiciable;t.     prohibit discriminatory laws and executive actionsgenerally;iii. the enforcement section of the Declaration of Rights willexclude the right to challenge any law on grounds of inconsistency once the law has existed for 10 years (we wantedno such limitation.     The Rhodesians proposed no right to challenge after 2 years).5.     Even so the Rhodesian draft is objectionable to us because itwoulda. exclude from the guarantee restrictions on the acquisitionor use of land (defined in terms which would permit separationin clubs, restaurants, etc,);b. exclude from the guarantee education;c. contain a &quot;broad exception (founded upon specialcircumstances or the state of the economy);d. authorise the Executive to certify that laws fell within this broad exception, thus putting a higher burden of proof onthe claimant;e. exclude from the guarantee discrimination under lawsexisting in 1971 (including, of course, new discriminatorymeasures brought in by the regime).3
10,   The changes which we are seeking from Smith in his draft area, the elimination of any exclusions from the guarantee ofeducation and use of land;b, insertion of the basic 1961 provisions (Section 67(4): see annex B) which would still allow a broad exception, but wouldexpressly exclude any increased measures of discrimination,11,   The Fourth Principle was originally designed for the removal of discrimination which existed in 1961,     In order now to deal withdiscrimination in 1971 laws, we are proposing only the Commissionreferred to in paragraph 31 above, whose recommendations would be inno way binding upon the rhodesian Government,12.   We have at one time in the course of the negotiations suggestedthat the Courts should, when considering exceptions to the anti-discrimination provisions, be guided by the overriding objective ofworking towards an overall reduction in discrimination.     This isnot now being pressed.13.   The following further points are relevant to the Fourth Principlea. Smith thinks he can give;  an assurance that there will beno further expulsions of Africans from land where they have longestablished rights until the Review Commission has reported.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary hopes to secure astatement that there will be no further evictions except wherejustified on husbandry grounds.b. Smith still maintains his objection to the release offurther land for African use.     It is still hoped to get some form of statement that it is Rhodesian policy to buy Europeanland and make it available to Africans as the need arose.We are still pressing for an undertaking to make a substantial amount of land available for Africans.4
c.     We have sought agreement that African professional men suchas doctors aid lawyers may occupy professional premises in theEuropean areas vdthout a permit.      Smith has so far refused to concede this; hut is still being pressed.c.     Smith has also indicated clearly that he is concerned notonly with the maintenance of discriminatory arrangements aboutland use which affect Africans but with the introduction ofnew discrimination against Asians (currently classed withEuropeans).     The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary has made it clear that this would be unacceptable.14.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary will be tackling these points at his meeting with Smith on 22nd November.     He has reportedthat if Smith rejects our proposals on discrimination this will mean thatthe end of the road has been reached.G HLaw Officers1 Department21 November 19715
ANNEX ARHODESIAN IWOTIATIONS:SUMMARY OF IMPORTANT ISSUESFIRST PRINCIPLE1.     Number of Common Roll seats to be created at parity to representthe basis for claiming majority rule0     Not agreed,     Mr Smith wants6:   we have been pressing for 10.     The Foreign and commonwealth secretary has Cabinet authority to settle for 8, if necessary.     He hashow suggested that he might in the last resort try for agreement on apossible compromise of 6 seats for the first election after parity and4 others from the time of the second election after parity.     This haspresentational disadvantages.2.     The Qualifications for the Higher African Roll - ie whether wecould secure agreement to the reduction of the income qualification(in addition to 4 years secondary education) from $1200 per annum to$1000 per annum.     Mr Smith refuses to accept this and it is thoughtthat the point will have to be conceded.3.     Mr Smith desires a Commission of Enquiry at parity to ascertain the views of the Rhodesian people on the creation of the Common Roll seats or any possible constitutional alternatives:    (any changeshowever would have to be by the procedure agreed for constitutionalamendment of specially entrenched clauses and subject to the blockingmechanism).     This has had to be conceded.Method of electing the Common Roll seats     It has been agreedthat this should be on the basis of a single national constituencycovering all seats.     We may have to concede however that this shouldbe by allowing voters to give more than one vote to candidates up tothe total they can cast (equal to the total number of seats to be filled).     This system tends to favour monolithic and highly-organisedparties and we would prefer proportional representation or some othersystem which would more accurately reflect the growing African numberson the Common Roll,5.     The Rhodesians have agreed to a modest simplification of the complex Voters Registration Form, in the case of the Lower xifricanRoll.6
76.     A Temporary Moratorium on Constitutional Amendment, un-tin. tKo nr,xhelection and the addition of the first two Higher African Rollrepresentatives has been agreed.THIRD PRINCIPLE7.     Immediate creation of first African seats won by registrations onthe Higher African Roll has been agreed in respect of the first 2 seats.We are still trying to obtain agreement that this should apply also tothe next 2 (indirectly elected) seats.FOURTH PRINCIPLE8,     Anti-discrimination provisions in the Declaration of Rights.   no satisfactory agreement reached.     This is the crucial issue outstandingand is dealt with in the main paper,9,     Assurance on no further expulsions of Africans from land where theyhave long established rights,     Mr Smith thinks he can give assuranceabouc no more expulsions until Review Commission on existing legislation has considered the question and reported.     The Foreign and commonwealth secretary hopes to secure a statement that there will be no furtherevictions except where justified, on husbandry grounds,,10,   Release of further land for African use.     Mr Smith has stillmaintained further objection to any additional allocation of land:   butit is still hoped to obtain some form of statement that it isRhodesian policy to buy European land and make it available to Africansas the need arose.     We are still pressing for an undertaking to make asubstantial slice of land available for Africans.11,   We have sought agreement that African professional men such asdoctors and laywers may occupy professional premises in the Europeanarea without a permit,     Mr Smith has so far refused to concede this,but is still being pressed.
12,   The Enforcement Section of the Constitutional clauses referring to the Declaration of Rights    We have had to accept a compromiseperiod of 10 years (an improvement on the 2 years originally sought &quot;bythe Rhodesians) as the period after which it is no longer possible toexercise the right to challenge any law on grounds of inconsistencywith the Declaration of Rights,     (Our preference was for no suchlimitation,,)OTHER POINTS13.   Release of Detainees     Present number in detention andrestriction is 100,     Five are about to be released and it is planned to release 31 more far Christmas,     Remaining 62 hardcore cases willbe reviewed by Review Commission,lit-.   Control of the Media    Rhodesians have offered compromise over theproposed unrestricted power of regulation in relation to broadcastingetp.but are still insisting on unrestricted power to regulate thePress,     It is still hoped that they may agree to accept the compromiserelating to the Press also.15,   Debt Liability     The question of obtaining a Rhodesian statementaccepting liability for their outstanding debts (some  60-65 millionpublic and private debts to the United Kingdom) is still being discussed,16,   Advancement of Africans in the Public Service    We are stilltrying to strengthen the somewhat thin assurances on this containedin the draft &quot;Proposals for a Settlement&quot;,17,   Commutation of Death Sentences    Mr Smith wishes to discussprivately with the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary,8
18*   Preventive Detention (including renewal during State ofEmergency)a. We have not succeeded in substituting a magistrate for&quot;the responsible Minister&quot; as the person who must besatisfied within 14 days that reasonable grounds existfor a detention,b. In compensation, however, we have obtained agreement that the period within which a detention ca&quot;se must beereferred to a tribunal shall be 42 days instead of3 months,c. We have also secured agreement that subsequent reviewsby a tribunal shall be at intervals of 9 months insteadof 12 months,^9.    ^XSiSPSSSJ&quot; Programme      Mr   Smith would favour giving a100 per cent Rhodesian matching contribution to our aid for a programme of African education and development, provided that our aid is all grant.     But this remains to be finally agreed.9
