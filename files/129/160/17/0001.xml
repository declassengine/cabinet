DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(71) 152 COPY no. 7 December 1971CABINETROLLS-ROYCE? DRAFT WHITE paper note by the Secretary of State for defence. I circulate the text of a White Paper on Rolls-Royce prepared by the ministerial Group on Rolls-Royce in conformity with the promise made tothe House of Commons that a White Paper would be published when the futureof the RB 211 engine had been decided.    Since the Group saw the draft, some changes have been introduced to take account of a discussion I and theMinister for Aerospace have had with Lord Cole and Sir Henry Benson.I draw my colleagues&apos; attention in particular to che reference inparagraph 33 to the visit which two Directors of Rolls-Royce Ltd paid to thePrime Minister the day before the Receiver was called in.2. The White Paper is intended as a sober and objective account of whatoccurred, the position with which the Government were faced, and thereasons for the decisions we took.    It deals with the sequence of events fromthe date of the Governments taking office to the placing of Rolls-Royce Ltdin receivership, and with the action subsequently taken to support the RB 211.It concludes with the contract between Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd and the lockheed Corporation, activated by the United States Administrationsrecent decision to guarantee funds to Lockheed,3. The White Paper also includes as an Annex the summary report of theIndustrial Reorganisation Corporation^ (LRC) Investigation into Rolls-Roycegiven to the Labour Government in December 1969.    This differs only inmarginal respects from the summary included in the full 1958-59 Report, which many of my colleagues have seen;   it is the version which was the basis ofaction taken at the time by the then Administration.4. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry would publish theWhite Paper, and lay It before Parliament.    Arrangements are being madewith a view to publication as a Command Paper on 14 December 1971.    Thisis a tight timetable with little margin and in the absence of any indication tothe contrary by 10 December I shall take it that my colleagues concur withthe course proposed.Ministry of Defence7 December 1971
ROLLS-ROYCE LIMITED AND THE RB 211 ENGINE1.     In June 1970, when the present Government came into officagreement already existed &quot;between the Ministry of Technology and Rolls-Royce Limited for the provision of launching aid for the RB 211 engine.(A note on general launching aid policy is at Annex A.)2.     Tho RB 211 is a large sub-sonic engine for use in the new generation of wide-bodied civil aircraft.   The agreement with Rolls-Royce had beenconditional on that firm receiving an order from an American aircraftmanufacturer and, in principle, had existed since 29 March 1968, the date on which Rolls-Royce signed a contract with Lockheed for the supply of450 engines (150 aircraft sets) for the L 1011 Trijet aircraft.   Afurther 96 engines had been ordered by airlines as spares.   Deliverieswere due to begin in 1971-   The 100 engines scheduled for delivery inthat year were to be supplied at a fixed price of  354?000, which includedadjustments for customer demanded modifications.   An escalation clause inthe contract provided for increases in the price of engines scheduled for delivery in later years to take account of changes in wage rates andmaterial costs.3.     The original estimate of launching costs for the RB 211, made in 1968,was  65.5 million.   Exceptionally, the scale of the governmentalcontribution had been agreed at 70 per cent of launching costs within amaximum of  47*1 million.   At the time the present Government came into office the estimated total launching cost had increased from the originalfigure of  65.5 million to  118.5 million,   llo additional launching aidbad been agreed but, following an investigation made by the industrial reorganisation Corporation (1958-59) at the end of 1969 at the request of theprevious Government, that organisation had undertaken to make an unsecuredloan of  20 million to Rolls-Royce for general purposes,  10 million in1970 and up to  10 million in 1971-   A summary of the conclusions andrecommendations of this investigation was made available tothe Government and is reproduced at Annex B.   As a condition of providingthis support the 1958-59 had required Rolls-Royce to strengthen themanagement responsible for financial control and forward planning and1
CONFIDE! itialby sale of assets or otherwise to make capital savings of at least 10 million,,     Lord Beeching and Mr Ian Morrow were appointed to the rolls-Royoe Board, the former as IRCfs representative and the latteras a Joint Deputy Chairman to take special responsibility for strengthening financial control and forward planning.     Theirappointments were announced on the day of the Annual General Meeting,21 July 1970.4*     In view of the increased launching cost of the engine and uncertaintywhether-this could be recovered against sales, Rolls-Royoe had decided to write off  20 million of their expenditure in the 1969 accounts.     Thiswas mentioned in the Chairman&apos;s statement at the Annual General Meetingof the company held on 21 July 1970.     On the future prospects of thecompany the Chairman went on to say -&quot;As already stated, at the present time the company is financinga major part of the development costs of three new civil engineswhich is placing a heavy burden on its cash resources.     In thesecircumstances your directors have thought it right to recommend toshareholders the proposal for a loan from the 1958-59 of  10 millionwith provision for a further  10 million to be available from april 1971 onwards subject to terms and conditions to be negotiated at that time.     It would not be the intention of IRCto retain any ordinary shares acquired upon conversion but whileIRC continue to hold a substantial interest in the company theBoard will agree with 1958-59 on the appointment of a director torepresent its interests.     The Board is satisfied that, with thebanking facilities available, the company has sufficient working capital.&quot;5.     Before accepting his appointment the new Deputy Chairman had spentsome time inquiring into Rolls-Royce affairs and on 10 August 1970, theChairman at that time being away, he was invited by a senior official ofthe Ministry of Technology to discuss the state of the company.     the deputy Chairman reported that his enquiries had revealed that thesituation was much worse than previously supposed.     Development costs of the RB 211 were going to escalate further, and it was now expectedthat there would be a loss on every engine contracted to Lockheed.Firmer figures were expected by the middle of September.     The department at once put in hand a full-scale technical investigation of the RB 211.2
6.     The company&apos;s revised assessment in September revealed that theestimate of launching cost had risen to about  135 million (as comparedwith  65.5 million at the outset and  118,5 million when the present government came into office), and there was an expected loss on productionof  40 million (later revised to  45 million).    This confirmed the irnpres-sion which the new Deputy Chairman had given in August.   In addition, thecompany stated that there would be a loss of profits arising from a reduc-tion in expected sales of other engines ( 18 million), and the withdrawal of investment grants which was expected to reduce the   cash flow ( 15 million).As a result, the company expected an overall ca.sh short-fall of  60 million in the years 1971 and 1972 after taking account of the first  10 milliontranche of the 1958-59 loan.7.     The Board of the company recorded their view in a report to theDepartment on 17 September that the financial implications were such thatthe Board was unable to see how the company could continue in businesswithout an injection of long-term new money over the next two years.   TheDepartment took the view, following an investigation of Rolls-Royce fore-casts by its own accountants in association with 1958-59 staff, and in the lightof the technical investigation mentioned in paragraph 5? that enginedevelopment could be completed successfully, that the manufacturing taskinvolved in meeting Lockheed&apos;s requirements for production engines wassevere but feasible, and that there was no reason to dissent from thecompany&apos;s revised overall financial forecast, although there could be no assurance that the latest estimate of launch costs would not be exceeded.THE  60 MILLION PACKAGE8.     There followed extensive and urgent discussions in which the Government,Rolls-Royce, the Bank of England, the Midland Bank and Lloyds Bank (theprincipal   bankers to Rolls-Royce), hazards (the leaders of the AcceptingHouses consortium and financial advisers to Rolls-Royce), and the PrudentialAssurance (the major share-holder) participated at various times.   The3
CO NFJDENTiALGovernment made it clear that they were not prepared to find all the cashrequired, and that they would expect the City of London to share the risks   and   the   financial   burden.     After   various   alternative courses had been considered a firm proposal emerged, under which theGovernment would increase the launching aid provided for the RB 211 by 42 million and the three banks - the Bank of England, the Midland bank and Lloyds - would lend Rolls-Royce  18 million,,9*     In these discussions the Government were assisted by Sir Henry Bensonof Cooper Brothers who, on 6 November 1970, were asked as a matter of urgency to advise on certain problems affecting the proposed government financial help to Rolls-Royce.   In their report on 9 November CooperBrothers pointed out that they had not had time to probe or verify thecompany&apos;s estimates, but, on the basis that they were a   fair estimate ofthe position and future outturn, they agreed with the Government view thatthe best method would be launching aid in association with a loan from the banks.     At   the same time Cooper Brothers made the point that, while this additional aid was designed to meet the immediate problems, there appeared to be a number of long-term problems which required examination.They therefore recommended that the Government should set in hand a full-scale independent report on the position and future prospects of the rolls-Royce Group and that acceptance of an enquiry on these lines shouldbe a condition of granting the new assistance to them.    The company*s agreement to this condition was readily given.10.   The three banks agreed to provide the  18 million which was requiredto implement their part of the proposals, and drew up with Rolls-Royce the heads of Agreement attached at Annex C.   It was prepared in final formon 9 November, before Government decisions had been taken, and the first sentence of this document was, in effect, a statement by the parties to the document of the basis on which they were prepared to go ahead - if theGovernment put in  42 million launching aid, they for their part would enter into the arrangements described in the rest of the document.4
11.   In the course of discussions with the three hanks, the (Government had made it plain that the grant of the sum of  1+2 million in the form offurther launching aid, while agreed in principle as part of the package of 60 million from the Government and the hanks, would he subject to a checkof the figures by independent accountants to determine the exact sum required.12.   The Minister of Aviation Supply, who had assumed office in the new ministry on 20 October, made the following statement in the House of commons on 11 November -&quot;In 1968, the previous Administration made arrangements to providelaunching aid up to  47 million to Rolls-Royce Limited for itsRB 211 -22 engine, which had been ordered for the Lockheed Trijetaircraft.   The aid was intended to cover, after certain adjustments,70 per cent of the estimated launching cost of  65 million.   this figure was later revised to  75 million without any increase inlaunching aid.Her Majesty1 s Government have now been informed that the cost of launching the engine is estimated to have risen to  135 million.Recognising the magnitude and importance of this   programme, theGovernment have decided to join with the company and its bankers in meeting the increased cost.   For their part, the Government will make further provision for launching aid at the existing rate of70 per cent.   Subject to a further check of the figures by independentaccountants, to satisfactory contractual arrangements, and tolimitation for a period of any distribution on the company&apos;s ordinaryshare capital, the additional launching aid vri.ll be 70 per cent of theincreased cost over  75 million up to a maximum of  42 million, thusmaking a total of up to  89 million towards the cost of launchingthis engine.   Rolls-Royce will pay my Bepartment an appropriate levy on all engine sales.   The banks for their part will be making afurther  18 million available.   No further assistance will be providedby the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation beyond the  10 million which was committed by it under the   previous Administration.5
Rolls-Royce is itself making its half-yearly statement todayin which it is announcing changes in the company&apos;s management.The House, I trust, will join me in expressing the hope that this important development programme can now he successfully completed.&quot;13.   Also on 11 November, Lord Cole was elected as the now Chairman of the rolls-Royce Board.14o   Though development of the KB 211 was still far from complete, andthere was clearly a risk of further cost increases, the sum of  60 millionincluded a margin for contingencies, and it was not at the time contemplated&quot;by any of the parties that it would prove seriously wrong.    If theaccountants * investigation had shown that a smaller sum would suffice, itwas envisaged that the contributions by Government   :and banks would bereduced in proportion.     If a larger amount proved necessary, the parties would clearly have had to consult together.   The uncertainty about thefigure of  42 million was explained by the Minister of Aviation Supply inthe House of Commons on 23 November -&quot;One or two Hon Members asked what was meant by the  42 millionbeing subject to the appointment of an outside accountant.   It wassolely because the sums varied so rapidly and so often,   I thoughtit right, because of the magnitude of the sums, to make sure exactly what the shortfall was, because the sums required to meet the cashflow depend upon the degree of shortfall.&quot;15.   The Accepting Houses for their part had a long-standing agreement toaccept Rolls-Royce bills within a limit of eS20 million.   As part of the package, they were invited by the Bank of England to continue this facility,only a small proportion of which remained unused in November 1970, for oneyear beyond its expiry date of April 1971?   and on 10 November 1970 they agreed to do so, having seen the Heads of Agreement referred to inparagraph 10 above.   Some months later, following the failure of Rolls-Royce,6
the suggestion was made that the Accepting Houses had consented to continue their facility in ignorance of some of iterolovaatfacts, and more particularly of the extent to which the Government!s undertaking to provide  42 million could he regarded as conditional.   The Accepting Houses were not informed by the Bank of England that the sum of  42 million to he provided &quot;by theGovernment would &quot;be subject to check by the independent accountants because this check was essentially a matter of determining the exact sum to be paidby the Government to Rolls-Royce, and the Bank took the view that it wasnot a matter of such significance as to require them to draw it specifically to the attention of the Accepting Houses.16.   On 24 November 1970 Cooper Brothers were also asked to conduct the study which they had recommended into the long-term position and financial &apos;structure of the company and this was also required by the banks (seeparagraph 6e. of Annex c).    Cooper Brothers&apos; Terms of Reference were -&quot;To examine and report to the Minister of Aviation Supply on the profit and cash forecasts of the Rolls-Royce Group of companies for the years 1970 to  1974 inclusive and prospects thereafter -and in particular -an     The range of aeroengine work under development and in prospect and how the expenditure will be financed.bo     The steps which are in hand by the company to improve thenranrcgTSTHeirt organisation of the company;   to reduce costs;and to eliminate unprofitable expenditure.c.     The long-term finance required and how this might bemet. &quot;This study was not completed when Rolls Royce went into receivership on  February 1971.17.   The package of financial assistance arranged for Rolls-Royce inNovember 1970 was intended to meet cash flow requirements which would notarise until later.   It was expected that the company would need to begindrawing on the new facilities at about the beginning of February .19711 and7
the negotiation of the contract for the payment of the Government launchingaid was accordingly put in hand.   No payments had been made, nor had thecompany begun to draw on the additional  18 million loan facilities offered by the banks, at the point of time when the arrangement concluded in November was overtaken as a result of the Rolls-Royce reassessment ofthe RB 211 project.   This reassessment, in January 1971? indicated thatthe company&apos;s cash requirements would be very much greater than had previously &quot;been envisaged, because of difficulties which were beingencountered with the project, the consequential slippage in delivery dates(involving financial penalties) and escalation of production costs,THE RECEIVERSHIP18.   On Friday 22 January 1971 the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of *Rolls-Royce called at the Ministry of Aviation Supply at their ox-m request,accompanied by Sir Henry Benson of Cooper Brothers.   They reported that intheir viextf Rolls-Royce was in a most serious situation.    The latest assess-ment of the RB 211 had just been made and this had shown that the existing programme of development and production could not be met;   there would haveto be a postponement of initial engine deliveries for a minimum of 6 months,and it might well be for a period of 12 months.   While ultimate technicalsuccess could still be achieved, engine development on the test bed waslagging behind expectations, and a large number of modifications to the design wrere still emerging, at a time when the engine should have been going into full scale production to meet Lockheed requirements (delivery of the first engine to full production standard was due in August 1971)*It was clear to the company that this overlap between modifications of design and production would lead not only to delay, but also to sharplyincreased production costs, since parts in production would have to be scrapped or modified.8
19. They considered that the company1s position was such that there were only two courses open -a. to stop the RB 211 forthwith (the course they made it plain that they favoured, in the company&apos;s existing circumstances);    orb. to postpone the programme, in the hope that the extra time would enable the engineering problems to be overcome.They recognised that the second course might be impracticable because itwas dependent on Lockheed and the airlines accepting a postponement of6-12 months.20.   whichever of the courses was adopted it was clear that substantial additional cash requirements would be needed over and above existing facilities.     The company had not been able to  make more than a very-tentative assessment of their requirements in the time available but itwas clear to them that they were on such a scale that it was improbable that the Government and the City interests would provide them.     Thecompany had excluded from their estimate of additional cash requirementsLockheed&apos;s (and perhaps the airlines1) possible claims for damageswhether for delay or non-fulfilment of contract.     Their rough estimateof such possible claims if the project was delayed was  40-50 million.No estimate had been made of the possible claims if the programme was stopped, but these would be much higher than under postponement.21.   The Departments monitoring of the project, and the review byCooper Brothers which was not yet complete, had given no warning of thiscrisis, which became apparent only from technical and financial assess-ments completed by the company a few days before 22 January.     On that day, Friday, an immediate further technical appraisal of the engine was set in hand.     On the same day, the company informed their clearingbankers, who early in the following week withdrew the special facilities which had been negotiated in November but had not been drawn upon, andat the same time instructed the company not to allow their ordinary over-drafts with each of the two banks to exceed  20 million.     On 22 -january the Department also informed the Treasury;    the Chancellor of the Exchequin turn informed the Prime Minister immediately after his return from singapore on 23 January.     The Department followed this up with an9
assessment of the position &quot;based on the information then available andthis was forwarded to the Treasury on Monday 25 January.     On 25 january the Parliamentary Secretary (the Minister being abroad until 26 January)held a meeting of officials, attended also by the Treasury andSir Henry Benson, and, later on that day, reported further to the PrimeMinister.     The report confirmed that the whole future of the RB 211project and of the company itself was at risk, that a further major inter-vention by the Government to protect defence interests appeared inevitable,but the Government would not have the collective view of the Rolls-RoyceBoard until after their meeting the following day, 26 January.22.   On Tuesday 26 January, the Rolls-Royce Board reviewed the latest costestimates.     The Minutes of the Board meeting record that they were told that the estimated launching cost had risen by a further  24 million andthat the production loss was now estimated to be twice the amount assessedin September 1970, namely  90 million instead of  45 million.     As aresult, a further  110 million cash flow would be recjuired, as comparedwith the  60 million estimated in September 1970.     The estimates made no provision for possible claims for damages by Lockheed (paragraph 20 above).In the 4 months since September 1970 revised estimates of the total cost over the life of the RB 21i (as opposed to the cash requirements for thenext 4 years) had increased by approximately  200 million;    while this increase might be offset by an increase in profit on sale of spare partsduring the life of the project, this could not be assured and did not inany case help the immediate cash problem.     In the light of these figures,the Rolls-Royce Board concluded that the RB 211 could not be completed within the resources currently available to the company, or likely tobecome available to the company from outside sources, and that the company were left with little option but to stop the project.23.   As pointed out in paragraph 20 considerable additional finance wouldbe required over and above the company&apos;s existing facilities.     The board were advised of the various suggestions of salvage operations that hadbeen considered including a moratorium scheme with the company&apos;s creditors,the acquisition by the Government of the whole of the company&apos;s share capital, and some arrangement for the Government to take over the aero10CONFIDENTIAL
engine business and pay off the aero engine creditors.     They were informedthat both the last 2 schemes had so far been rejected by Ministers* but ifa Receiver were appointed the Government might buy from the Receiver at aprice to be agreed, those parts of Rolls-Royce necessary to carry on the engine business particularly to protect its defence interests and to supportcivil aviation.     The Board noted that the Government would be told of thecompany&apos;s willingness to discuss with them an arrangement of the sort out-lined above, and that the Government would want time to reach a balanceddecision as to their course of action.     The Board were also told that ministers would be considering the situation and determining their courseof action later in the week, including the outcome of the Board meeting,and this is evident from the timetable of events which the Board went onto discuss.     It was recognised that the situation might be changed oraffected by the attitude of Lockheed who, up to that date, had not beeninformed of the situation.24*   The Board had previously been advised by their lawyers that continuing to trade in circumstances tirhere the company was in effect insolvent would put them at risk under Section 332 of the Companies Act 1948.     Under thissection, as it has been interpreted by the Courts, persons who are party totrading by a company at a time when there is no reasonable prospect of itscreditors being paid may incur both criminal liability and civil liability for the company&apos;s debts, if the company is wound up.     The Chairman of theBoard, summing up the implications of the advice received, pointed out thatin the circumstances, if the Government were to make an arrangement of the sort outlined in the previous paragraph, it would be as good an outcome as could be hoped.25*   The Board went on to consider the likely timetable of events.     TheGovernment was expected to determine its course of action by the end ofthe week;    talks with Lockheed would take place in the following week, anda statement by the company, folloxved immediately by a Government statement,should be made on 4 or 5 February, followed very shortly by the appointmentof a Receiver.     The Board decided that they would be justified in continuing to trade for the short while remaining within that timetable*At this stage no decision had in fact been reached by Ministers and as alater passage in the Minutes shows (see below and paragraph 25, first sentence) the Board were clear on this point.11
so as to allow discussion to take place on an orderly &quot;basis with theGovernment and Lockheed.     The Board also decided in principle that,subject to discussions with Lockheed and with the Government, the company should not continue with the RB 211 project.     The Secretary was asked to record that this decision was not taken on account of any doubt about thetechnical success of the engine.26.   The discussion described in the preceding paragraphs, and the reasonsunderlying it, were reported to the Department later on Tuesday 26 January:the other Departments concerned were informed the next day.     The furthertechnical assessment carried out by the Department was completed by28 January and was similarly reported to Departments.     The assessmentbroadly endorsed the views of the company:   the remaining technical problemsof the engine were capable of solution, but this would take time and it was most unlikely that the delay to the programme could be less than 6 months,27.   On 29 January 1971? Ministers reviewed the position in the light ofthe outcome of the Rolls-Royce Board meeting, the legal advice given to theBoard at that meeting, and the Department&apos;s assessment.     The situation was kept under continuous review by the Government over the next few days, inwhich close contact was   maintained with Rolls-Royce, the United states administration was consulted, discussions were held with Lockheed, and various courses of action were considered accordingly.28.   Rolls-Royce&apos;s liabilities were large, hurriedly estimated, in partunquantified and unquantifiable.     The extent of these liabilities would depend on whether the RB 211 were completed or cancelled.     If it were cancelled the Government were advised that the liabilities could have runinto hundreds of millions of pounds.     If the RB 211 went on, the companythought they would need at least an additional  150 million to cover theirexpected cash flow deficiency ( 110 million) and to provide for claims byLockheed and the airlines for delay (estimated at  45-50 million).     no great reliance could be placed on the company&apos;s estimates which had beenprepared hurriedly, and which they themselves stated would be subject to considerable amendment as more information came to light.     In thecircumstances reported to them and having regard to the magnitude of the12
figures Ministers considered that, whether the RB 211 project was stoppedor continued, it would not he a responsible use of public funds to assume avery large uncruantified commitment either by supporting the company withfunds which it had no prospect of repaying or by the Government taking thecompany over and thereby making itself responsible for all the company1sdebts and obligations.29o   If the Government were not prepared to take over the company andunderwrite its large and unquantified liabilities, the Board*s proposalsfor the appointment of a Receiver (subject to the outcome of the impendingtalks with the Lockheed Corporation who were themselves in some financialdifficulty) would take effect.     Thereafter, two choices would be open tothe Government - either to take no further action, and. let the receivership,and ultimate liquidation of the company, follow its normal course   or toenter upon negotiations with the Receiver for the purchase of those Rolls-Royce assets which were vital to the national interest.     If a Receiverwas appointed, however, the Government could not leave it to chance whether some suitable buyer emerged for those parts of Rolls-Royce business whichsupplied the needs of the armed forces, foreign air forces, and airlines.The Government therefore decided that the only tenable course, assuming no solution in the talks with Lockheed, was that they must stand ready, once a Receiver had been appointed, to negotiate for the purchase of these partsof Rolls-Royce&apos;s assets, and to take the action necessary to make this possible.30.   During the course of these discussions Rolls-Royce, who had been kept informed of their general tenor, confirmed at a Board meeting on 1 february the minutes of their decision of 26 January, and put in hand, subject tothe outcome of the talks with Lockheed, the consequential action.     also on 1 February, in the absence from Washington of President Nixon, the PrimeMinister spoke on the telephone to Dr Kissinger, the Assistant to thePresident for National Security Affairs,     He told Dr Kissinger in confidence about the Rolls-Royce position and the threat to the RB 211engine *13
31.   Routine discussions with the Chairman of Lockheed had earlier been planned to start in London on 2 February.    The Department believed thatLockheed should have been informed of the situation at the earliestpossible moment, and had been pressing for these discussions to be brought forward, but this proved impossible.     The talks on 2 and 3 Februaryrevealed no solution in the limited time available to the problems setout in the preceding paragraphs.    At a meeting between   the Board of rolls-Royce and Lockheed representatives at 9.30 am on 3 February it wasagreed that the immediate appointment of a Receiver was inevitableunless the British Government undertook to put up a sum in excess of 100 million and unless Lockheed undertook to increase the price theywould pay for the RB 211 engines, to abandon all claims under theexisting contract, and to accept a delay in delivery of up to 12 months.Lockheed were unable to give these undertakings for which they felt theyhad neither the authority nor the resources.     The outcome of the talks with Lockheed was immediately reported to the Government.32.   The Government considered the possibility of providing interimfinance to enable the company to meet its current expenses so as to buysufficient time for a full review of the situation in the United States&quot;by Lockheed, their bankers and airline customers.     But it would takeLockheed and other interested parties in the United States at least30 days to consider the position:   moreover, any financial help to them from the United States Government would require an Act of Congress.The likelihood of a successful renegotiation of the RB 211 contract which would afford Rolls-Royce Ltd a reasonable prospect of a return tosolvency, and so permit the Directors of the company to continue to trade,was therefore too remote, and it was clear that no solution on theselines could be found which was consistent with Section 332 of theCompanies Act 194-8.   Although the section is not binding opca thai. Crown,the Crown could plainly not be a party to the carrying on of any business in contravention of that section, as it would have been if it had provided interim finance in the above circumstances.14
33*   With the knowledge and agreement of the Chairman of Rolls-Royce,two directors of the company, Lord Beeching and Sir Maurice Laing,called on the Prime Minister to emphasise the consequences ofcancelling the RB 211 and the need for time.     In the light of thecircumstances of the company and of all the considerations arisingfrom it, however, Ministers concluded that there was no course ofaction open to them which would avoid the appointment of a Receiver.They confirmed the as soon as action to appoint a Receiver wastaken the Government should indicate their intention to acquire the assets of the aero engine and the industrial and marine turbinedivisions of Rolls-Royce and to introduce the necessary legislation for this purpose.     The same day, 3 February, the Prime Ministerspoke to the United States President and to Mr Packard, the deputy Secretary of Defence.     The Prime Minister explained thelegal situation of Rolls-Royce and the intentions of the Government,and the implications for Lockheed were discussed.     No undertakingswere given on either side and the two Governments agreed to keep intouch.     Rolls-Royce were informed of the government&apos;s conclusions.15
34*   The next day, 4 February, the Rolls-Royce Board again considered theposition of the company in the light of the outcome of the discussions with Lockheed and the Government.     The loss of resources already committed to the project, combined with the losses which would arise on termination,were in the opinion of the Board on such a scale that they were likely to exceed the net tangible assets of the company.     The Board thereforeconfirmed that, having regard to the advice they had received with respectto Section 332 of the Companies Act 1948, they had no alternative but tocomplete the procedure envisaged at their meeting on 26 January and ask the trustees for the Debenture Holders to appoint a Receiver and Manager.35&quot;   The Board immediately informed the trustees for the Debenture Holdersthat the Directors did not believe there was any available alternative tothe company ceasing to carry on business, and therefore invited them toappoint a Receiver at the earliest possible moment.     The trustees did this the same day.     The Board also resolved to convene an Extraordinary GeneralMeeting of the Company, to be held as soon as practicable.     At thismeeting, the members would be asked to pass a Special Resolution in accord-ance with Section 165(a) of the Companies Act, 1948, requesting theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry to investigate the affairs ofthe company.GOVERNMENT ACTION FOLLOWING THE RECEIVERSHIP36.   On the same day, the Minister of Aviation Supply made a statement in the House of Commons which included the following passage -&quot;To ensure continuity of those activities of Rolls-Royce whichare important to our national defence, to our collaborativeprogrammes with other countries and to many air forces and civilairlines all over the world, the Government have decided to acquiresuch assets of the aeroengine and marine and industrial gas turbineengine divisions of the company as may be essential for these purposes.16
The necessary legislation will he introduced early next week,The Government have no liability in respect of the contract between Rolls-Royce and Lockheed.   The Government will explore,with the Receiver, the future of the RB 211.   Because of thevery grave consequences which must follow from the decision of the rolls-Royoe Board, the Government are also undertaking urgentdiscussions with the Lockheed Corporation and with the United StatesGovernment.&quot;37,   At this stage, in view of the vd-despread ramifications   of the rolls-Royce receivership, involving a number of Departments and thenational defence interests, the Prime Minister appointed the Secretaryof State for Defence to co-ordinate the Government activities in theoperation.   (The Secretary of State for Defence handed over this responsibility to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry inMay when responsibility for civil aircraft affairs previously handled by the Ministry of Aviation Supply passed to the Department 0^ Trade andIndustry.)38.   In order to give time for the Government to investigate with Lockheedand other interested parties, including the United States Government and american banks, the possibility of negotiating a new contract for continuing the RB211 programme, the Receiver was asked to maintain work on the RB211for a limited period under an indemnity from the Government,   In addition the Government -a, arranged through the Department of Employment to give thenaxinum help in finding alternative employment for those whosejobs were affected.b, took steps^to ensure that the banks were not prevented bycurrent credit restrictions from accommodating (subject to normalbanking criteria) suppliers and sub-contractors of Rolls-Royce whoneeded temporary additional finance;c, accelerated the payment of investment grants to industry generally.17
39 *   Authority to allow the Government to purchase any required part of rolls-Royce was taken in the Rolls-Royce (Purchase) Act 1971.   A new company, Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd, was created to take over the businessacquired by the Government, and directors were appointed.   Heads of Agreementdealing with the purchase from the Receiver of those assets essential toour national defence, to our collaborative programmes with other countries and to many air forces, civil airlines and private operators all over theworld were signed and this was announced in the House of Commons on19 March 1971.40.   The Government also acted to acquire Rolls-Royce patents.   TheLord President of the Council made the following statement in the House,of Commons on 11 March -&quot;The Government have paid to the Receiver the sum of  20 million to meet the acquisition by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom as a necessary act of official policy of all the patentspreviously held by Rolls-Royce Limited and it subsidiaries.   Theyhave done that in order that the use of the patents should besecured against any interference which might prejudice thedevelopment and production of aircraft and other engines for U3efor military and civil purposes in Britain and throughout the world.Some engines are being developed in collaboration with foreign government.   Any impediment to the use of the patents would be gravely damaging to British defence interests, and foreign policies.That is why, in the national interests, Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave so acted.   It is our intention to license the use of the patentsto the new company and, where appropriate, the purchasers of other assets.&quot;FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS ON THE RB 21141.   After the Receiver had been appointed, the Government asked sir William Cook, Sir St John Elstub and Professor Holder to undertake anindependent assessment of the RB 211.   Their report was submitted on-18 February.   They expressed confidence that the remaining developmentproblems could be overcome, with a 6-month slip in the programme.   their estimate of remaining launch cost (in addition to  100 million alreadyspent) was  120 million, including a provision for contingencies;   theloss on the production contract was estimated at  80 million.   These losseswould be offset by net profits on spares during the life of the engine, toa present (discounted) value of some  50 million.     The latest estimates of costs are given in paragraph 55.
45.   Resident Lockheed engineers had been present at Derby throughoutthe programme to watch progress.   Senior technical and accounting staffof -8&amp;&amp;t company were now given full facilities to examine the latestRolls-Royce technical and financial forecasts.^3.   Negotiations with the Chairman of the Lockheed Corporation took placeon 2, 3 and 4 March, under the Chairmanship of the Secretary of State for defence.   The Government tabled their latest estimates for the cost of the project,   Lockheed were of the opinion, on the basis of the Rolls-Roycefigures which had been made available to them, that these estimates were too high: they stated their view that remaining development expenditure should not need to exceed  60 million and that insufficient account hadbeen taken of the likely profit from future sales of spares.   TheGovernment therefor put a proposal to Lockheed designed to inviteLockheed to back their own judgement -a. The Government would be prepared to provide the additional 60 million which Lockheed tentatively thought would be adequate to cover the remaining development costs, but if this provedinsufficient Lockheed would be asked to contribute any furtheramounts required.b, A joint company (or agreement) should be established betweenRolls-Royce 0 971) Limited and Lockheed for the management of the RB 211project;   through this company the two companies were to share equallyall.&apos;profits or losses arising from the R3 211 production programme(including profits on sales of spares), and all costs of further development of the engine beyond the initial agreed specification.By this means Lockheed would also participate fully in thetechnical and financial management of the programme.19
c. the price of the  3 211, taken as an average over 646 engines,should be increased by up to  150,000 although the precise sun wasnegotiable;d. mutual warranties to be arranged, whereby each pariycould be assured that the other would complete its 3hare of the project;e. damages for delay under the original contract would be waived,It was made clear to Lockheed that the Government was prepared toconsider counter proposals, either within or outside the Government&apos;3&quot;package&quot;.4-5*   while the Chairman of Lockheed said that he was not in a position tofind these proposals acceptable, he undertook to discuss them with theUnited States Government, banks and airlines.   During the talks in Londonhe was not able to go beyond an offer to discuss a waiver of penalties for delay up to 6 months and an increase in engine price of  40,000.46 ,   At an early stage in the lengthy negotiations which followed, it became clear that Lockheed would be unable to obtain the financial backingnecessary for it to participate in the RB 211 programme on the lines suggested.   The Government was thus faced with only two alternatives:either they would have to contribute the whole of the remaining enginedevelopment cost and provide financial support for production to theextent that it proved impossible to negotiate price increases whichcovered the higher production costs now foreseen, or they would have tocall a halt to the RB 211 programme.    On condition that adequate provision could bo m:\de for the future cf the TriStar project itself,the Government resolved in principle to adopt the first of these alternatives.47,   Negotiations therefore concentrated on the amount of the price increase and on the possibility of satisfying the proviso referred to in the preoedingparagraph.   On their sida Lockheed continued negotiations with theirbanks and customer airlines.20
2fB o   Towards -the end of March, the Secretary of State for Defence and. the attorney General went to Washington for discussions with the United states administration and with the Chairman of Lockheed.     At that time theAdministration, in view of the national interests involved, was exploringthe possibility of Government financial support for the TriStar project.On 5 May the Administration announced its intention to seek Congressionalauthorisation to guarantee loans to the Lockheed Corporation.4-9. On 10 May the following report about the state of the negotiations wasmade to Parliament -&quot;Her Majesty&apos;s Government and Rolls-Royce (.197.1) Ltd have been in negotiations with the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation for the supply ofthe RB 211 engine to power the Lockheed TriStar aircraft.     tfe havealso had discussions with the United States Government.Negotiations with the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation have been in 2parts.     First, Her Majesty&apos;s Government have agreed with the LockheedCorporation to finance Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd in the development and production of the engine and to enable it to maintain the necessarysupport facilities throughout the life of the engine - provided thatwe can be satisfied that there is sufficient support to enable theTriStar project to be completed.For its part the Lockheed Corporation has agreed to a substantial increase in the price of the engine, equivalent to some  50 million for the first 555 engines, and to annul penalties under the oldcontract for delay in delivery of the engine.On that basis Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd has been negotiating a newcontract with Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, which is on the point ofagreement.     The nexv contract will be governed by English law.Because the RB 211 has been designed for the TriStar and there is atpresent no other significant market for it, it was clearly necessary,as part of the contract negotiations, to be sure about the future ofthe TriStar project itself.     Given the risks involved in largeaviation projects and the known problems of Lockheed, it is clear that effective support for financing the TriStar project can only beprovided with the assistance of the United States Government, just assupport for the RB 211 engine can be given only by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment.21
The United States Administration have now announced that theyare seeking authority for the United States Congress to guarantee upto $250 million additional credits for Lockheed, which amount theyanticipate will he sufficient to assure the continuity of the Tristarproject.   Before providing such guarantees the Administration will,of course, have taken steps to satisfy themselves that the other requirements for the completion of the project are met.The main outstanding point here is that it will &quot;be necessary for both Governments to be sure that the airline customers will still buy the Tristar, notwithstanding the delay and the increasein price.   Representatives of Lockheed and the airlines are meeting in London at this moment with Rolls-Royce (&quot;1971) Ltd for detailed discussions on this point and on the arrangements for completing the rb 211 project.Meanwhile, Her Majesty&apos;3 Government are continuing to finance workon the RB 211 engine and the Department of Trade and Industry isdiscussing with Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd arrangements to provide thecompany with the finance it will need to give effect to the agreementwith Lockheed.   This will involve some  100 million for completionof the development of the engine: to the extent that costs are not covered by the price increase which Lockheed has agreed there willhave to be additional support for initial production engines.   against these costs we must of course set those which would be incurred if the project did not continue and the profit arising from the sale of spareThe House will appreciate that there are still problems to resolvebefore we can be sure that RB 211 will go ahead.   Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment have done everything that they can to establish a basis for agreement that is acceptable to all concerned.   In particular theyhave kept RB 211 going, and will continue to do so, in the expectation of a satisfactory agreement.   An early decision from the other partiesis a matter of increasing urgency. Meantime, the House will appreciate that delicate and complex negotiations still continue.&quot;22
50*  The 555 engines mentioned in the statement comprised 447 engines(14-9 aircraft sets) required by Lockheed and 108 engines required as sparesby airlines.   The production of engines after the first 555 was not covered in the arrangements announced by the Government, since Rolls-Royce (1971)Limited -were confident that they would be able to cover their full production costs at or before this stage.   Possible requirements for further developmentof the RB 211 to power advanced versions of the Tristar were left for later decision,51c   On 11 May, following discussions in London with Lockheed and seniorairline representatives, Rolls-Royce (1971) Limited signed a contract with Lockheed to provide the R3 211 engine for the Tristar at the new price,subject to the fulfilment of conditions as to guarantees by the UnitedStates Government of adequate finance for the Tristar, and as to airlineorders.52.   On 23 May, Rolls-Royce (1971) Limited took over from the Receiver thegreater part of the assets of the aero-engine, marine and industrial gasturbine divisions of the old Rolls-Royce company, including the assets whichwould be required to complete the R3 211.53.   On 9 September, after the necessary powers had been granted by congress, the United States Administration agreed to guarantee theadditional credits for Lockheed.   On 14 September, the new contract between Rolls-Royce (1971) Limited and Lockheed entered into force,airline orders having been confirmed, and the following formal notificationhaving been received from the United States Administration pursuant to article 40 of the contract -&quot;On 9 August 1971? the President signed legislation, PL 92-70, whichwould authorise the Government under certain specified terms andconditions to guarantee loans to Lockheed in amounts of up to$250 million.   The United States Government, acting through thethree-nan Emergency Loan Guarantee Board established by thelegislation, have met and have determined that Lockheed&apos;3application meets the statutory requirements.   Accordingly, theEmergency Loan Guarantee Board i3 prepared to guarantee loans forLockheed Aircraft Corporation in an amount of up to $250 million.This amount, together with the funds available to Lockheed fromother private sources, the Emergency Loan Guarantee Board considerssufficient to enable Lockheed to carry out its L1011  project.23CONFIDENTIAL
Before seeking legislation to guarantee loans to Lockheed theUnited States Government satisfied itself, having regard to theorders for the L1011 aircraft placed with Lockheed and the orders which might reasonably be expected, that the company will be ableto carry out its L1011 project.&quot;52p.   The Government !s undertaking announced in Parliament on 10 May thustook effect, and the way was clear for the PJ3 211 programme to proceed.Between 4 February and 14 September, when the final decisions were taken,approximately  40 million had been spent on development and initialproduction of the engine.   The programme at Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltdhad been continued at the full rate in order to protect the contractualdates which had been offered to Lockheed and airlines.55.   Before the final decision on 14 September, Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltdhad made a full re-estimate of RB 211 costs from 4 February 1971&quot;     Theyreported that, with a margin for unforeseen contingencies, they now expected to spend up to  125 million to complete launching, and they expected a net loss of up to  45 million on producing 555 engines, after allowing for the  50 million price increase agreed with Lockheed andairlines.     Thus, the total estimated cost to the Government would be 170 million.     This estimate is subject to the effect of the detailedpricing provisions in the Government&apos;s contract with Rolls-Royce (19T1) Ltdon RB 211 financing, and to changes in sterling/US dollar parity.     InFebruary, Sir William Cook&apos;s Committee had estimated a total cost to theGovernment of  200 million, or  150 million after allowing for the price increase.     This estimate however made no specific allowance for development costs after the end of 1973;   the latest Rolls-Royce estimatereferred to above allows for development costs up to April 1975&quot;     Thisdifference in dates combined with a higher estimate of losses on productionaccounts for the  20 million difference between the 2 estimates.     Thecost to Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be partially offset by profits onspares throughout the life of the engine, but these depend on a number of factors and no reliable estimate can be made at this stage.     Theestimates will in any event need to be kept under continuing review,since they cover work on a very large and complex project over a numberof years.24CONFIDENTIAL
CONCLUSION56.   The failure of the old Rolls-Royce company had confronted theGovernment with a situation of immense gravity, affecting not only ourown   armed   forces and national airlines, but many overseas governments and airlines as well.   Cur reputation as a trading nation and as leaders in technology would have been damaged if the Government had not steppedin quickly and effectively to preserve the physical resources of thecompany and to provide finance and leadership for continuing on a new basis.   Something of the order of 100,000 jobs would have been at stakeat Rolls-Royce and their suppliers, of which around a quarter wereattributable to the RB 211 project, with contingent risks in respect ofeconomic and social costs; if uncertainty had been prolonged, the solvencyof many major firms would have been at risk and business confidence wouldhave been gravely impaired throughout the country.   The Tristar andRB 211 situation, which has been described above, compounded these difficulties.57*   The rescue of the RB 211 required 8 months of intensive effort on both sides of the Atlantic.   Vihen the old Rolls-Royce company went into Receivership, there seemed very little likelihood that the problemsof the Tristar and RB 211 could be sorted out satisfactorily and new contracts negotiated.   While, at the time, it was judged that the enginedevelopment could be completed successfully, it was necessary first&apos;forLockheed and airlines to agree to delay delivery, to forego contractualpenalties, and to increase the engine pri^-e; securing Lockheed&apos;s financial situation involved legislation by Congress; for the British Government,the very large new expenditure required to complete the RB 211 could notbe committed while there was grave uncertainty about the aircraft or itscustomers; during the long period of uncertainty, the programme atRolls-Royce and numerous sub-contractors had to be held together.Corresponding efforts had to be made during this period to find a basis on which Rolls-Royce could continue to operate the remainder ofits activities.25
59.   The decisions involved during this period for the Government andfor Parliament were of the utmost difficulty; they had to be taken quicklyagainst tne background of a complicated and uncertain situation.   Theco-operation of the Receiver and Manager during the interim period wasinvaluable.59.   Completion of the RB 211 programme, delivery of the engines ontime to airline customers, and support of those engines in servicethroughout their life will require a continuing technical and production effort.   The Government believe that a stable basis has nowbeen provided for continuing the vital aero-engine business of Rolls-Royceand for preserving their high technical reputation.   They look to themanagement and workers of Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd to complete tho tasksuccessfully and thus enable the Company to retain its place, in collaboration vrith industrial partners in other countries, as a majorsupplier of civil aero-engines to world airlines.26
ANNEX ALAUNCHING AID POLICY(see paragraph 1)1.     Launching aid for civil aircraft and engines has been a policy of successive Governments since the war;    current procedures date from .I960.     In brief, launching aid is an interest-free financial contributionto the launching costs of a civil aircraft or aero engine project,repayable as a levy on sales and licences to the extent that these are achieved.2.     Launching costs comprise the cost of design and development,production jigs and tools, and &quot;learner costs&quot; (ie the higher labour costs incurred in the early production stages).     The Government1scontribution is an agreed proportion of the launching costs as estimated at the outset, normally not more than 50 per cent.     Underthe normal procedure, it is regarded as an inflexible rule thatlaunching aid is not increased if the estimate is exceeded.3.     In return, the Government receives as a levy on sales of engines and spare parts a share of the forecast margin between the proposedselling price and the estimated manufacturing cost.     This margin, andthe Government share, is normally fixed at the outset (subject to reviewarrangements in some eases).     The intention behind the arrangement isthat production risks, as well as the risks of a cost overrun on development should lie with the manufacturer, so that for example, ifmanufacturing costs exceed estimates and erode the actual margin, heshould still pay the Government levy.     Risk and the possibility of profit should thus remain with the manufacturer and provide a commercialincentive and a spur to exercise commercial judgements.27
ANNEX BROLLS-ROYCESUMMARY REPORT OP THE INDUSTRIAL REORGANISATION CORPORATIONCOMMUNIGATED TO THE DEPARTMENT ON 22 DECEMBER 1969(See paragraph 3)Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations1o     The 1958-59 investigation into Rolls-Royce commenced on 1 October and thedeadline agreed with Mintech for the year end has been kept.Mr Michael Clapham has been the Board Member with special responsibility and Mr Gardiner, Mr Ewart and Mr Wilkinson the executive staff assigned tothe project.2.     The system of investigation followed IRCs usual pattern of intensivediscussions with the Company and financial and industrial appraisals.     Theexecutive wishes to record its appreciation of the fullest co-operationextended by Rolls-Royce and the Ministry of Technology, which made aspecial contribution as the sponsoring Ministry.3.     The terms of reference posed two basic questions -1.     To assess Rolls-Royce*s capital shortfall and to make recommenda-tions as to how this could be met to ensure the long term stability of the Company.2.     To make comments on the level and form of existing government support to the aero-engine industry, with particular reference toLaunching Aid.The implications of Rolls-Royce?s capital shortfall were found to be sopressing that the main body of the Report has concerned itself with 1.above.4.     The   main elements in the financial crisis facing Rolls-Royce are thefollowing -i. Profits are forecast to fall from  13 = 3 million in 1969 &quot;to 8.8 million in 1970 and reach only  14.9 million in 197*1 -ii. However, these profit figures are struck after R and Dcapitalisation in 1970 and 1971 of  33.1 million (before tax).28CONFIDENTIAL
iii. Without this capitalisation of R and D there would be a lossof  5,1 million in 1970 and of  4.3 million in 19715   the turnrounddoes not come until 1974 when profits are over  34 million aftercharging R and D costs incurred of  5-3 million.iv. Short-term borrowings are forecast to increase from  45 million to  90 million by the end of 1971t thereafter they rise slightly fromthis level until 1974.v. If the shortfall is met through bank borrowings, Rolls-Royce,sgearing, at 44 per cent already over twice the national average, will rise to 53 per cent by 1971.5*    The calculations above have been extracted from Rolls-Royce&apos;s Five-year plan.   They are considered a broadly accurate estimate of the short-term crisisthough, as has happened in the recent past, there will be further revisionswhich  ire likely to increase the sums involved.   One of the basic assumptionsthat has been made in forecasting the sharp rise in borrowings to 1971 and thehigh level at which they remain through to 1974* is that development workon the RB 211 stretched will start up in 1970-710     Uncertainty stillsurrounds the future of the stretched version and the level and timing ofIRC support has therefore been kept flexible in the Recommendations totake this into account.     Strict conditions must also be attached to anyIRC finance for the reasons below.6.     In the pasx Rolls-Royce1s profit forecasts have been significantlyover-optimistic.     It cannot, therefore, plausibly be argued that Rolls-Royce1 s problem is only the short-term liquidity difficulty which willbe solved when good profits are seen in 1974 (when they are forecast tomove to  39.4 million) and a rights issue can be mounted.     The argumentof jam tomorrow will not wash.7.     The steps being taken by Rolls-Royce to reduce manpower and to sellassets will help marginally to ease the cash crisis.     But they are notcomprehensive or far-reaching enough and the cuts in capital spending couldbe mortgaging the future.     Further action will be necessary if Rolls-Royceis to achieve its profit forecasts in 1974 and to secure stability in the longer term.29
8,     Measures required are:   a strengthening of the management chargedwith the responsibility for financial control and forward planning systems;integration of the two Aero Engine Divisions at Derby and Bristol;   moresub-contracting and the sale of at least one Division.9.     The problem, therefore, is not simply to make funds available toRolls-Royce to enable it to ride the immediate liquidity strain but to seethat money is provided in a form and on conditions that will get at the basic management weakness in financial control and forward planning.10.   Even if the banks could be prevailed upon to agree the massiveincrease in Rolls-Royce*s short-term borrowings and thus alleviate the short-term cash crisis, it would only worsen the problem of excessivegearing and would do nothing by way of financial incentive or pressure.11.   More Government subventions would also not tackle the basic weaknessand, indeed, it is difficult for the Government to use its money as a leverto secure changes that will help the companyfs long-term viability.     It isclear that the size of the problem is such that only strong measures with substantial financial backing will produce results.     The financial proposals detailed below could involve 1958-59 in its biggest single commitment of funds apart from British Leyland.   It is considered that on grounds of balance of payments and technology Rolls-Royce is a sufficiently important national asset as to require 1958-59 action on the proposed scale.     Thefollowing considerations are relevant, though none can be taken to imply that Rolls-Royce must be supported irrespective of the costs involved.12.   Rolls-Royce makes a very substantial contribution to the balance ofpayments.     Mintech does detailed calculations on this for projects forwhich launching aid is requested.     In the past these have shown that theimplied subsidy to Rolls-Royce is less, as a proportion of the foreign exchange earned, than the e.c. countries allow on average for all their exports through the rebate of the value added tax.     For aero engines the criteria applied in judging the cost to Her Majesty*s Government of generating foreign currency have been more stringent than with the computer industry or the aluminium smelters.30
13.   Rolls-Royce also makes important contributions to technology.     It isin a high value added industry where raw materials are only between -15 per cent of production cost.     The average value per ton of jet and gas turbine engines exported this year up to October was over  50,000 -this compares with an average for the mechanical engineering sector exportsof  1,000 per ton.     Rolls-Royce has pioneered important developments in new processes, materials and equipment.     These include advances in the useof titanium and in the development and use of carbon fibres and numericallycontrolled machine tools.     In metal working techniques Rolls-Royce hasevolved applications for electron beam x^elding, electro-chftmical formingand electro-discharge machining.14*   A longer term consideration is the prospect of the United Kingdom*industrial role in Europe and the need to establish a European force in keyareas of advanced technology.     The aircraft industry has led the way inmulti-national projects and it is important that the United Kingdom continuesto make a full contribution.     Rolls-Royce occupies a unique position inthis respect.15.   In terms of 1958-59*s criteria, quite apart from the strategic considera-tions of its substantial military work, Rolls-Royce must rank as a high priority.     This is not to say that Rolls-Royce must be supported for everand a day irrespective of the cost.     To date it has earned its keep andthe recommendations are designed to enable it to continue to do this.Recommendations16.   Any proposals for the involvement of 1958-59 finance with Rolls-Royce canonly be implemented at the request of the Minister of Technology as provided for under section 2(l)(b) of the 1958-59 Act.     The three points onwhich satisfactory agreement must be reached with Government are -i. Mintech&apos;s support for the future of the aero-engine industryand for 1958-59*s proposals;ii. Mintech*s agreement that the terms and timing of Launching Aidwill be discussed with 1958-59;iii. an understanding with the Government that 1958-59 would have access to funds additional to the agreed budget for 1969-71 to do the Rolls-Royce project.31
*Recommendation I17*   It is recommended that, subject to satisfactory assurances on theabove, 1958-59 finance for Rolls-Royce be made available as part of a phasedpackage of proposals as follows -io     1958-59 would agree to make available a convertible loan of 10 million on terms to encourage Rolls-Royce to meet its profittargets provided Rolls-Royce agrees with iio, iii., iv. and v.below?ii. Rolls-Royce would agree with 1958-59 steps for strengthening the topmanagement structure and forward planning and financial controlsystems.     The Managing Director will uish to refer to this point at the Board Meeting?iii. Rolls-Royce would sell the Oil Engine Division and set a target for release of other internal resources to reach a total 10 million;iv. Rolls-Royce would agree to discuss with 1958-59 proposals forintegrating AED and BED and extending its sub-contracting?    andto provide 1958-59 -with quarterly financial information on eachdivision^v. to accept an 1958-59 Director on Rolls-Royce Board.18.   This initial  10 million together with the  10 million released from internal resources, should be sufficient to meet Rolls-Royce&apos;s liquiditysqueeze up to the decision on going ahead with the stretched version ofRB 211.     This decision will have to be taken within a year.     If thestretched version is developed it is likely that a further injection ofcapital will be required.Recommendation II19.   To meet this it is recommended that on evidence of Rolls-Royce^progress in achieving ii., iii.t iv. and v. above and on condition thatMintech proceeds with Launching Aid in agreement with 1958-59, 1958-59 should consider providing up to a further  10 million on terms to be decided inthe light of the company&apos;s liquidity position at that time and of thearrangements for Launching Aid.     This further loan could he convertibleinto Rolls-Royce&apos;s equity or into Rolls-Royce&apos;s shareholding in BAC.     Thefinancial effects of this package are discussed in the Report.*The recommendation that the Oil Engine Division should be disposed ofwas subsequently set aside, following further discussion between theCompany and the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation.32
20.   The 1958-59 loan to Rolls-Royce comes at a critical period in the company&apos;sdevelopment.     The escalation in development costs in the sixties character-istic of the aerospace industries has been phenomenal.     For example, thedevelopment costs incurred 10 years ago on the civil Spey were approximately 20 million, the ecruivalent sum being spent for the development of the basicRB 211 was  80 million.     Between these two periods there was no commensurateincrease in Rolls-Royce&apos;s profits or cash flow and the gap has been bridgedby capitalisation of R and D, higher borrowings and Government finance.     in short, future profits have been heavily anticipated, and a further act of faith will be necessary if the stretched RB 211 proceeds.     In this situation there is little chance that a merger XV ITH Rolls-Royce would be acceptable toanother United Kingdom company.     A takeover from overseas would undoubtedly be resisted by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.     Without additional finance toallow the basic RB 211 programme to proceed Rolls-Royce would be forced toclip its wings and opt out of the big league.21o   This would be the wrong moment to take such action with so muchalready committed and the prospects insufficiently clear.     Both Pratt andWhitney and GE have been severely hit by the escalation of development costs and there are signs that Rolls-Royce has a technical lead.     The basicRB 211 contract has given Rolls-Royce for the first time access to the highvalue United States market and it is possible that this position could beconsolidated and built on.     Rolls-Royce&apos;s engineering excellence has sofar enabled it, despite the disadvantages of the relatively small UnitedKingdom market and the contracting military programme, to stay in the topflight of companies in one of the most advanced and costly technologies,22.   The purpose of the first part of the proposed package is to relieve the immediate cash crisis so that Rolls-Royce can proceed with its currentwork load under much tighter financial control;   the purpose of the second part of the package is to create a situation in which discussions affectingthe- future programme of work of Rolls-Royce can be taken on a, consideredbasis between Rolls-Royce, Mintech and 1958-59.
