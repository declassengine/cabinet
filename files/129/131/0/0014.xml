BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)0C(67) 114 COPY NO, _30th June, 1967CABINETAPPROACH TO EUROPE: DRAFT OPENING STATEMENT TOTHE MINISTERIAL COUNCIL OF THE WESTERN EUROPEAN union note by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for consideration by the Cabinet at their meeting onMonday, 3rd. July the draft of a statement which I would propose to make to the Ministerial Council of the Western Eurcpsan Union on Tuesday,4th July, together with an introductory note.G,B.Foreign Office, S.W.1.30th June, 1967
INTRODUCTORY note the e.c. Council, meeting in Brussels on 26th June, failed because ofFrench obstruction to agree on even an approximate date for a first hearing of our case for membership of the Communities.     The Belgian Government,with support from the Germans, Italians and Dutch suggested that her majesty&apos;s Government should make the opening statement which we had hoped to make to the Community before the summer holidays, on the occasion of the7ffiU Ministerial Meeting in The Hague on 4-th July.     The French did not oppose this suggestion, but simply said that it was not for the EECCouncil to decide what should be discussed at the wEU Ministerial Meeting.Following the e.c. Council Meeting the Belgian Government has proposed to us that we should make our opening statement in The Hague on 4th July, and thisproposal has also been urged on us by the German Foreign Minister and by theItalian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.     The Dutch Government has indicated that they would welcome this.2.    Accordingly, the Foreign Ministers of the Five have been informed thatwe accept this suggestion and that the Foreign Secretary will make astatement at The Hague on 4th July putting the case for Britain&apos;s membership of the Communities and setting out the points which we would hope to seecovered in negotiations.3.    EFTA and Commonwealth Governments and the Government of the irish republic have been informed of our intention.4.    In view of the certainty of leakages as soon as the statement has beenmade, it is proposed that it should he published as a White Paper immediatelyafter delivery.5.    The text will also he communicated formally to the Chairman of theCouncil of Ministers of the Community and to the President of theCommission;   and for information to the Governments of member countries;to EFTA and Commonwealth Governments and the Republic of Ireland.6,    The aims which we should set ourselves in our opening statement are:(i)   to open the way to starting negotiations with the Six as soon aspossible, and to keep the negotiations short and confined tothe essential issues;
(ii)   to achieve (i), we must set out our negotiating- position in broad-terms but also in sufficient detail to enable us to say that it covers all the significant matters which we need to have settledprior to entry;   lesser matters can be covered by a general^form of words;(iii)   to present the problems and our suggestions for their solution in as &quot;Community&quot; a light as possible;(iv)   to avoid raising difficulties which we are confident the Communitywill have to raise themselves,7,    The attached draft attempts to realise these four aims,8.    What our strategy should be in detail after the delivery of an openingstatement is something which we cannot judge until much nearer the time.If we make our opening statement on 4-th July, the Commission will be ableto take account of it in preparing their opinion for the Council which wecan expeot to be ready in September.    We would hope that negotiationsproper would begin shortly thereafter.-2-
DRAFT i OPENING J5 TATEIvIENTThe United Kingdom has applied to become a member of the threeEuropean Communities - the European Economic Community, the european coal and Steel Community, and Euratom.   I have been charged by her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to make clear to the member Governments of the Communities the reasons for our application and its consequences as we see them.2.    We in Britain are conscious that this is a decisive moment in our history.   The issue will shape our future for generations tocone.   We can   scarcely over-estimate the gravity of the enterpriseon which we are embarked.3.    We believe the same is true for Europe as a whole.   And webelieve that the present opportunity may not easily come again.Unless Europe is united she will not be able to meet the challengeof the world today.   And we must all of us meet it, or else driftfurther and further into the margin of events.   None of us, I believe,envisages a role of that sort as being commensurate with the skillsand wealth and wisdon of our Continent. The world as a whole toowould surely be a loser.   European civilisation has given so much toit in the past.   It has so much still to give^4.    The European Communities are developing on an economic base.But we in Britain, no less than the present Members of the communities, do not see the issues primarily in economic terms. the decisive considerations for us have been political.5.    Together we now have the possibility of gradually building up -between us a true unity of purpose and action.   But political power,and the ability to assert a European influence on events, must growout of economic strength.   That is why we have laid particular emphasisin our approach to this question on the technological aspects.6.    An integrated market and continuing progress towards economic union,the removal of national barriers which at present obstruct European industry from reaching to its full potential, and the consequent development of technological enterprise on a truly continental scale - these are urgent rquirements.   Let us have no illusions:   effective technological development will only be possible if we are in one market.   If we can provide for this we can be confident that Europe will maintain acommanding position in the increasingly competitive markets of the world,with all that that implies for the welfare and standard of living ofour own peoples.-3-
7.     But, as I say, we are aiming at something far more than materialprosperity.   We see this leading to a greater political purpose for western Europe.   And if that purpose is to be realised, Britainmust be a part of it.   We want, as soon as v/e can, to develop reallyeffective political unity with our fellow West Europeans.8,     The advantages for all of us of this unity will reach far wider than Western Europe itself.   We see this as a major step towards areconciliation and a revival in that larger Europe which his remainedtoo long divided between East and West.   We see this unity asenabling us all to bring a powerful influence to hear in other fields - in the Western Alliance and in the world as a whole.   we see it too as enabling us all to contribute more effectively tothe needs of the developing world.   We see it, in short, as power for peace.9.   The need becomes more urgent with every year that passes.   Assuccessive crises have arisen in one part of the world or anotherwe have, I believe, all felt increasingly that Europe has notplayed the part it could and should.10.   Similarly, the economic problems of the developing world growheavier every day.   We are each providing quantities of aid already.But we cannot say that we are doing- enough.   The requirement here,no less than in the political field, is for the common approach which a united Europe could provide.11.     Britain now asks to join you.   We share your objectives.   we want to link our efforts with yours.   So do other European countries.V/e are convinced that this is the right road forward.12.   Pears have been expressed that there would he some radicalalterations in the nature of your Communities if other european countries were now to enter them.   We have already given assurances about this, and what I have to say today will confirm them.   Thefundamentals of the Communities will remain unaffected, for weshall be accepting precisely the same treaty aims and obligations as yourselves.     We shall he entirely loyal to the letter and tothe spirit.-4-
13,   There will of course he changes.   But they will he changes ofdimension - a larger Community, a more powerful and more influentialEurope.   None of us should have anything to fear here - for thiswhole concept of size is$ as I have explained, the essential element of that unity we aspire to.   And above all that unity requires acommon purpose and outlook, and a will to work together.14.   I have set out, in brief, the reasons for Britain&apos;s applicationsto join the Communities.   The processes of argument and debate in britain which led to our decision were long and arduous.   the issues have been carefully weighed in full realisation of what isat stake.   The massive vote which the Government received in theBritish House of Commons on 12th May in support of its policies isthe result:    opinion in Britain is strongly in favour of joiningour destiny with yours,15.   We seek to reduce the area of negotiation to the minimum.   Muchuseful preliminary work was in fact done in the series of discussions which the Prime Minister and I had with your Governments earlierthis year.   These discussions isolated the major issues and pointed to ways of resolving them.16.   We want to keep the negotiations as short as possible so thatwe can start work with you in the Communities at an early date.17*   I turn now to the business which immediately confronts us.18,   I begin with the Treaties.   They, and particularly the Treatyestablishing the European Economic Community are the pillars ofthe Community structure.   We accept all three Treaties, subject onlyto the adaptations which are required to provide for the accession of a new member, for example our participation and voting in the communities&apos; institutions, and our contribution to its finaicialexpenditure,19.   I shall come in a moment to the particular issues on which we seek satisfaction but let me say at once that,  subject to this,Her Majesty&apos;s Government accept without reserve all the aims and objectives of the Three Treaties and will implement them.-5-
2 i* a)20o   I will go further.   We recognise that the Community is a dynamicorganisation which has already evolved and will continue to evolve.If it is to he true to the spirit of the Treaties which establishedit, the Community&apos;s institutions will develop and its activities will come to embrace wider fields of integration going beyond the activitiescovered by the existing provisions of the Treaties.   We believe thatEurope can emerge as a united personality, fully capable of expressing its own individual point of view and exercising influence in world affairs, not only in the commercial and economic hut alsoin the political and defence fields.   We shall play our full partin this process.   Indeed it is the realisation of this Europeanpotential which has, above all, aroused our desire to join the communities.   As a member v/e shall accept whatever responsibilitiesthe evolving Community may decide to assume and v/e shall join aseagerly as other members in creating new opportunities for theexpression of European unity,   fife want full membership.21,   The questions to he settled before our entry are very few indeed.22.   It- has been generally recognised that all of us, you no lessthan v/e, will need a transitional period or periods to permit mutualadaptation to the circumstances of an enlarged Community.   I wouldlike to propose, following your example at the outset of theCommunity&apos;s life, that the first year of the transitional period should be a standstill period.   We see mutual advantage in following the example which you set in 1958.23.   There would he the further advantage that it would give othermembers of efta seeking membership of, or association with, theCommunity time to conclude their negotiations.   If, in the event,any of these efta countries, or the Irish Republic, were, by the endof thattwelve month period, in sight of, or at least well advancedtowards, agreement, I am confident that v/e could agree together onthe obvious consequences for the tariff treatment we extend to them.24*   In the case of EUBATOil /Jand the ECSC/, v/e seek nothing more than this twelve month initial period.   We are prepared fully to implementthese two Treaties and all the arrangements made under them twelvemonths after our accession.
25.   In nost fields our lav/ and practice are already in line withCommunity requirements.   Where they are not a great many of thenecessary adaptations could he made immediotely following on a.twelve months standstill.   In other cases, we shall he able to adapt our arrangements with very little delay;   but soae of thochanges which we shall be called on to make, particularly in thefield of agriculture, will be very considerable and an adequateperiod of adaptation will be needed.   You needed it yourselves.What the period should be will be a natter for discussion with you.26.   So much for transitional periods, which are clearly something which you will want just as muoh as we in order to allowadaptations to take place over a reasonable period of time.27.   I now turn to certain other questions which we are convincedit is in our common interest to discuss together and resolve,beginning with the few questions which I wish to raise in thefield of agriculture.28.   First, there is the question of an annual review.   When theCommunity and Britain negotiated in 196*2, the Community readilyagreed that it would be in the common interest that existingprocedures should be developed to ensure that the Commission andthe Council of Ministers were each year fully and accuratelyinformed of the agricultural situation and prospects in theCommunity before taking decisions on the levels of common prices;and that these procedures should provide for taking effectivelyinto account the views of the agricultural industry throughoutthe Community.   A procedure for an annual agricultural reviewheld in conjunction with the producer organisations could, webelieve, contribute materially to the smooth running and effectiveness of the common agricultural policy.29.   Secondly there is milk.   Here our aim is quite simple:    thatthe Community arrangements should ensure that we have adequate supplies of milk to meet demand for liquid consumption throughoutthe year,   I am sure you will recognise that, in conformity withthe aims of the Treaty, we must be able to offer our consumers a continued assurance of supplies.-7-
30. For pig neat and eggs, we should wish to see support arrangements to ensure adequate market st-ability in the enlarged Community.us but on which we do not believe our interests are in any way in conflict with those of other members.   We give special aid to farmers in the hill areas of the United Kingdom in recognition ofthe peculiar difficulties they face.   We would wish to be able tocontinue to give them assistance, in one form or another comparablein value to what they now receive, for without it they would manyof them face ruin.   This would in no way distort conditions of competition within the wider Community^/32.   As regards the financing of the common agricultural policy, onwhich we had most useful discussions with- all the Six governments and with the Commission earlier this year, I think it is recognisedthat the existing financial arrangements would put an inequitableburden on the United Kingdom.   But those for the period after 19^9will necessarily be affected by our entry into the Community.   Weshall look forward to taking part as a full member of the community in the negotiation of the agricultural finance arrangements for theperiod after the end of I969.33,   There are two questions which arise in relation both to commonwealth interests and to agriculture:    sugar and New Zealand.34o   For sugar, as you know, we have an agreement with commonwealth sugar producers which runs until the end of 197A-.   Your owntransitional arrangements expire six months later.    The commitmentwe have under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement is a contract whichwe must fulfil.     We believe that the sugar exported to Britainunder the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement can be accommodated withina reasonable production quota under existing Community regulations,and without departure from the precedents which you have set foryourselves.   We have also to look to the longer-term interests ofthe developing countries and territories many of whose economies areoverwhelmingly dependent on their exports of sugar and we believethat it is in the Community&apos;s longer term interest that we should do so.^In due course, we shall wish to discuss with you how these interestscan be safeguarded in the longer term.   We would of course alsoexpect that the arrangements for reconciling our sugar system with that of the Community should provide equitably for theinterests of our own beet growers and sugar rofiners.7.   Next, I must mention another matter which is of importance to
35.   Turning to New Zealand:    in 1962, and again when the PrineMinister and I visited the capitals of the Community countriesin the first months of this year, we found general recognition that her case was of an altogether special kind, and should betreated by the Community as such.   I do not believe that thisshould present the Community with problems which we cannotresolve together.   New Zealand1 s economy largely depends on hertrade in butter, cheese and lamb.   Because of the size of theBritish market for dairy produce, we believe that provisions for exports of butter and cheese from New Zealand would in no waybe inconsistent with substantial benefits accruing to othermembers of a wider Community*     In the case of cheese it may befound that in practice there will be little or no problem.   Butwe could turn out to be wrong about this.   So we shall ask you to agree to a review procedure to enable action to be taken ifit is necessary.     For butter) more precise provision will haveto be made.   Somehow, in discussions together, I am confidentwe can find a constructive and realistic solution.   For NewZealand has a strong common interest with Community farmers inwishing to see the level of butter consumption maintained inEurope.36.   I now turn to the remaining questions relating to theC commonwealth.37*   During the 1961-63 negotiations between the Community and Britain it was provisionally agreed that, with one or two exceptions,association under Part IV of the Treaty of Rome would be appropriate for our dependent territories.   We trust that you would stillagree that for these territories this is the best arrangement./We should discuss together the position of any dependent territoriesfor which association is not appropriate^38.   It was also provisionally agreed during the 1961-63 negotiations that association under what was later negotiated as the YaoundeConvention should be open to independent Commonwealth countries in africa and the Caribbean.   The Community subsequently repeated this offer in the Declaration of Intent issued by the e.c. Councilin july&apos;s I963 - a Declaration of Intent which was in no way dependenton Britain&apos;s becoming a member of the Community.   I trust that wecan quickly confirm that the alternative contemplated in this declaration will be open to independent Commonwealth countries in africa and in the Caribbean.
39a   I realise that the Yaounde Convention is due to expire inMay 1969.   It would scarcely he practicable for the commonwealth countries in question to negotiate accession to the presentYaounde Convention.   I therefore suggest that these countries should he allowed to continue the status quo in their presenttrading arrangements with Britain until new arrangements comeinto force after the expiry of the Yaounde Convention in the negotiation o.t which It should he open to them to take part.40.   Agreement was also reached in principle in the 1961-63negotiations that there should be certain trading arrangementsfor developing independent Commonwealth countries for whomassociation was not thought appropriate.   We hope it will be possible to revive them.41.   Another aspect of Community development to which we referred in our preliminary talks with your Governments was capital movements.   I believe the discussions we then had about this were particularly useful.   We fully accept the obligations of membership of the Community in this field subject only to a transitional period during which we would by stages bring our policies into line with yours.42.   During our preliminary talks we referred to the problem ofthe possible laak of portfolio Investment from the United Kingdominto third countries, particularly Into North America.   We havegiven further consideration to this problem and we would propose^,if it proves necessary, to take action to deal with it ourselves,after consulting you as provided for in Article 70(2) of the Treaty.43.   So far as tariffs ore concerned we shall he prepared to acceptthe CET as it will stand after the Kennedy Round reductions havebeen made /^subject to a few cases, affecting altogether only avery small percentage of the enlarged Community^ trade, where we think changes will be necessary in consequence of our entryor tariff quotas will need to be negotiated./    We shall of coursealso need to discuss how our tariff structure will he adjusted tothat of the Community within the period of adjustment to which Ihave referred earlier.-10-
44,     There will &quot;be a limited number of other points which will need to be considered.   The points of this kind which we have in mindat present include our accession to the Agreements associatingGreece and Turkey with the Community, and certain matters affectingthe harmonisation of laws in the agricultural and food field:we think that most of   these could be settled after we join theCommunity,45.   In all other fields v/e accept, as I have already made clear,the obligations of the Treaty establishing the European economic community and all the regulations, directives and other decisions taken under it ^including those on fiscal harmonisation/,  subject only to a transitional period and, of course, to developments inthe e.c. In the meantime.   ^So far as fiscal harmonisation isconcerned, we shall of course require a transitional period here,but thereafter and subject again to developments in the e.c. inthe meantime we shall be ready to proceed to fiscal harmonisationat the same time as the Community^/46,   I recognise that you on your side may wish to propose other questions for consideration during our negotiations.   We shall of course be perfectly ready to discuss these questions.   Iwould only add this.   I have set out fully and frankly the issues which we believe will require attention in negotiations to providefor our entry into the European Communities.   Our list is not a formidable one.   More than ever we hold to our view that it presentsno questions to which an answer cannot reasonably be found In our common interest.   I hope that, when the Community comes to respond,you will be as full and frank as I have been and will mention infull any additional points which you think should occupy thenegotiations ahead.   We shall then, between us, have a completeview at the outset of the ta.sk which faces us.47*   I will not make any suggestions at this stage about the procedures we might adopt for the conduct of those negotiations.I am sure that we shall be able to fall in with whatever you propose.-11-
48.   It only remains for me to say that the British Government andthose who will be responsible for the conduct of our negotiationswith the Community will spare no effort to bring them to a successful and speedy conclusion.   We- are confident that you will do no less.   It will be a negotiation, certainly, but with a difference.   The interests of Europe must prevail.   Only europe as a whole can gain, or lose, from our endeavours.   And Europe,already, is all of us.49*   I am sure that the statement which I have made to you this afternoon will help the Community in its consideration of our application and enable negotiations to open as soon as the opinionof the Commission has been given in September.   I am thereforeconveying formally the text of my statement to you, Herr Brandt,as Chairman of the single Council of Ministers of the european communities.   I shall also convey copies to the President of theCommission.   I am also arranging for the text to be made public in the United Kingdom.
