CONFIDENTIALHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)ADOPTION OF PERMANENT SUMMER TIMEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department and the Minister without portfolio the attached memorandum proposing the permanent introductionof Summer (Central European) Time was considered by the Home AffairsCommittee on 13th June.    The Committee approved by an overwhelming(but not complete) consensus the proposals:(i)  to bring in legislation early next Session to introduceSummer Time permanently with effect from the autumn of1968; and(ii)  to make a. further Order under the existing Summer Time Actsextending the statutory period of Summer Time next year soas to commence on 18th February.The Secretary of State for Scotland, who did not attend the meeting, has asked that this matter shall be considered by the Cabinet.2.       At Home Affairs Committee we reached the conclusion that thechange should be made as soon as the necessary legislation can be passed.    Further inquiry into the possible effects of the change wouldnot be likely to yield any conclusive results.    Indeed;, this is not a topicon which it is reasonable to expect conclusive arguments.3.       Likewise, the Committee were not in favour of having an experimental period.    This would be unsettling, and at the end weshould be likely still to be left with very much the same question of judgment as faces us now.    If the new arrangement should prove tohave results other than those expected (if, for example, it putinvestment in electricity generating capacity under strain in the early&apos;70s) amending legislation could be introduced.4.       We ask our colleagues to endorse the proposals that were approved by the Home Affairs Committee.C(67) 107COPY NO.16th June, 1967CABINETR.H. J.P.G.W.Home Office, S. W, 1.16th June, 1967
this document IS THE PROPERTY OP H:CR BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)On 29th July the Committee invited me, in consultation withthese of my colleagues concerned, to consider what further enquiriesmight be necessary to enable a decision to be taken on theadoption of permanent Summer Time (H(66) 19th Meeting:   Minute k) *2.     A review was undertaken by the Home Office and the scottish home Department into the social aspects of this question, and bythe Department of Economic Affairs into the economic aspects.Other Departments and outside interests were consulted as necessary.,,, A report of the joint findings is appended to this paper.Findings ef the Review3.     The report shows that, on the economic aspects, the advantages and disadvantages of the adoption of permanent Summer Time(i.e. Central European Time) are evenly balanced.     The change would bring some disadvantages, e.g. to the agricultural and construction industries, but also certain distinct benefits inother directions, for instance by improving commercial contacts with the Continent.k*     The social side of the enquiry has also elicited little inthe way of solid fact.     In the matter of road accidents, forinstance, there is some evidence that the change might bebeneficial, but it cannot be regarded as conclusive.     But thereport shows that since the previous enquiries were made in1959/60 there has, in England and Wales, been a pronounced shift of opinion in favour of the adoption of Central European Time.A major influence in this has no doubt been the prospect of our entry into the Common Market;    but, whatever the reasons, it isclear that the majority of representative opinion in Englandwould both welcome and expect the introduction of central european Time.-1-GOtflFfOEfiTiJIL
confidential,     Opposition te this course on social grounds is likely toe strongest among the rural communities and In Scotland, wherethe inconveniences of dark and cold winter mornings will be more severe, or severely felt.     But even here the opposition is lessstrong than it was.     There is a sizeable body of opinion inScotland - including, but not confined te, the Scottish T.U.C.and the Scottish Office of the C.B.I, - which would welcomeCentral European Time.6.     The review suggests, therefore, that there would be no seriousimpediment to the adoption of Central European Time if, particularlyin view of our application to join the E.S.C., this were consideredte be desirable, and that the general mood of the country wouldbe sympathetic to this change,I mp 1 e me nt at i on.7.     My swn view is that it would be right to make the change,&quot;and I see no purpose in deferring it beyond what the need fsrlegislation will require.      I propose that a Bill should beintroduced early next Session, with a view to making the changeeffective from the Autumn of 1968.     The electricity industry should have enough capacity for the winter of 1968/69.8.     While I recognise that there is force in the argumentspresented in paragraph 71 of the Report for introducing the changeexperimentally in the first place, I should not myself be in favourof this.     An experimental period would be unsettling, and Ibelieve that at the end we should still be left with very much the same question of judgment as faces us now.      I also subscribe to the view expressed in paragraph 72 of the lie-port that thepublic would be impatient of what might appear te them to befurther temporising.9.     The present Summer Time Order expires this year.     If my proposal is agreed, it will be necessary, in order to bridge the gap before the new legislation becomes effective, to make afurther Order under the present Acts for the extension of the duration of Summer Time in 1968,      This Order (which is subjectto affirmative resolutions) should be laid before the Recess, andlike the present Order, it could provide for an extension of thestatutory period by four weeks in the spring, bringing the starting date to 20th March, and - although this would be overtakenby the legislation - three weeks in the autumn.     There might,however, be advantage, to begin to accustom people to the change,in bringing in Summer Time rather earlier next year, say on18th February, which would then, if my proposal for peraanontlegislation is accepted be the date of final departure fromGreenwich Mean Time,Conclusion10,   I seek the approval of my colleagues(i)    to the preparation of a Bill, for introduction early next Session, substituting Central European Time forGreenwich Mean Time, with effect from the autumn of1968;(ii)    to the making of a further Order under the existing acts for the statutory period of Summer Time to beextended next year for the same periods as under thepresent Order,-2-

PARTI.    INTRODUCTION- iThe Home Secretary was invited by the Home Affairs Committee on29th July 1966 (H. (66) 19th Meeting Minute 4) to consider, in consultationwith other Ministers concerned, what enquiries might be necessary to enable a decision to be taken as to the adoption of permanent summer time (central european time).2.   The period of summer time - Greenwich Mean Time 4- 1 - is at presentgoverned by the Summer Time Order 1964 which fixes the period for thethree calendar years 1965,   1966 and 1967.     The Governments intentions for future years will need to be announced in the late spring or early summer of1967, and the inquiries have been geared to this.Legal Position3.    The period of summer time was fixed by the Summer Time Acts 1922 and1925 as beginning on the Sunday after the third Saturday in April (unless thatSunday was Easter Day when it was to begin the week previously) and ending on the Sunday after the first Saturday in October.    In 1940 summer time was extended throughout the year by Defence Regulations and a period of double summer time was introduced in 1941, but these arrangements lapsed at theend of the war and the normal period was reverted to.     The Summer TimeAct 1947 - passed during the serious fuel crisis - provided for thrn statutoryperiod to be altered by Order in Council.     The present Summer Time Orderprovides for an extension by four weeks in the Spring and three in the Autumnso that in 1967 it runs from the 19th March to 29th October.4.   The powers of extension conferred by the 1947 Act could not properly beused to displace Greenwich Mean Time altogether.     The introduction ofC. E. T. would therefore require legislation.Geographical Considerations5-    Since Great Britain is on the north-western sea board of Europe, notonly do the winter days tend to be shorter than in most continental countriesbut dawn is later than in other countries (except the more westerly Eire)on the same latitude.     The maps appended at Appendix A(i) and (ii) showtimes of sunrise and sunset at midwinter as they would be under C. E. T.and illustrate the difference in daylight hours between Great Britain andother Western European countries.6.    With the exception of Italy -  which is in the process of passing a summertime law to fix every year, within certain limits, the period during whichsummer time will apply - all other Western European countries, including those in Scandinavia, observe C. E. T. throughout the year.     The effect of
longitude is illustrated by the fact that on a common time scale, dawn in stockholm (which is further  north than the Orkneys) would in mid-winter bean hour earlier than in Glasgow and a quarter&apos; of an hour earlier even than inLondon.     Conversely, however, sunset would be two hours later both in glasgow and London,  (later indeed than in Rome).7.   Internally, the effect is the same; the further north the shorter the winterdaylight and the further west the later the dawn and the sunset.    The progressionwithin the country is shown in the table in Appendix B.     If C. E. T. were adopted there would in London, be a period of about a month when the sun roseafter 9 a. m. ;   in southern and central Scotland the period would be more than two and a half months;   and in the far north and west of Scotland more than three.The Previous  Inquiry8.   The 1964 Order - which was the first in which the period was fixed for more than one year - was made in the light of extensive enquiries carried outin 1959 -60 among some 180 organisations.     Of the 160 which expresseddefinite views 80 favoured the adoption of C. E. T.;   43 preferred an extensionof the statutory period in both spring and autumn;   8 supported an extension inthe autumn only;   and 29 wanted no change.9.   There was thus an almost even division between the number of organisations which wanted permanent summer time and those which did not.     The latterincluded some important special interests such as the electricity generatingindustry, the farming industry, the education service and about half of thetrade unions.     The attitude of the electricity generating industry was con-sidered to be particularly crucial:   it rested on the assessment that the effectof C. E. T. would be to shift the peak load in winter from the evening to the morning when it would be more difficult to meet.10. It was thought, however, that these difficulties,  and certain other considerations telling against the introduction of C. E. T. , might prove to betransient.     The 1964 Order was, therefore,  regarded as a holding operation and also as an experiment since it gave   an opportunity to judge public reaction to a more than ordinary extension of summer time so as to cover virtuallythe whole of the spring and the autumn.Form of Present inquiry11. It was decided that the inquiry should be in two parts -(i) social, in which the lead would be undertaken by the Home Office inEngland and Wales and the Scottish Home and Health Department inScotland;   and
(ii)   economic, directed by the Department of Economic Affairs inconsultation with other Departments concerned in this aspect.12. The range of options to be considered included reversion to the statutoryperiod laid down in the 1925 Act;   maintenance of the present period or itsfurther extension;   or the outright adoption of C. E. T.      Of these possibilities,only two - maintenance of the present period and the adoption of C, E. T.  -are discussed in this Report as support for the others was found to be minimal.13. The inquiries have shown relatively little divergence in the economic considerations affecting England and Wales on the one hand and Scotland onthe other, but a much greater divergence in the social considerations.     the inquiry did not extend to Northern Ireland, which is competent to make itsown arrangements in the matter, though it is hardly to be supposed that if great Britain were to adopt C.JE. T. Northern Ireland (or indeed the republic of Eire) would wish to stand out.       Prima facie   the considerations inNorthern Ireland may be expected to be very similar to those in Scotland.There is little difference between Belfast and Glasgow in the onset of dawn,although in Belfast sunset is a quarter of an hour later.
PART II.    SOCIAL, ASPECTS14. Since, inevitably, the comments were based largely on projection ratherthan actual experience there was a general lack of data to support the  views expressed, and in many cases an understandable difficulty in disentanglingthe purely social from economic, or even political,  considerations.     Many ofthe comments were clearly coloured by the prospect of Britain&apos;s entry intothe Common Market.   At least partly for that reason, there has since I960been a marked shift of opinion in England and Wales toward the adoption ofC. E. T. and some shift even in Scotland.Road Safety15. There are two conflicting considerations to be taken into account here.The first is that - assuming the introduction of C. E. T. would bring no radical change in the travelling habits of the British public - its adoption would leadto a greater proportion of winter travel falling within the daylight hours.The second, of which the effects are more difficult to calculate, is that fog,ice and other weather conditions conducive to accidents are more prevalentin the early morning than in the late evening.16.   In I960 the road safety interests considered that the balance of these factors tended to support an extention of summer time (to the period nowapplying) but not the adoption of C. E. T.     The Road Research Laboratory havenow examined the matter again and have reached a different conclusion.   Whileunable to forecast the likely increase of accidents due to weather encountered in early morning travel if C. E. T. were adopted, they have calculated that,this apart, had that system been in force in 1964 there would have been about580 extra fatal and serious casualties on week day working mornings and about870 fewer fatal and serious accidents in the evenings.     This  gives an estimated saving of 290 fatal and serious casualties during the period not atpresent subject to C. E. T.    A net saving of about 100 fatal and seriouscasualties should similarly have arisen at the weekends.     The total net saving of about 390 fatal and serious casualties represents just under O. 4% of theannual total.17.   So far as it can be quantified, therefore,  the balance of advantage now appears to be in favour of C. E. T. if only by a fine margin.    However, intheir calculations the. Laboratory were unable to distinguish between children and adults;   and they point out, that increased travel in darkness would be involved for pedal cyclists from Monday to Friday, the amount rising to as high as 9% in northern areas for part of the winter.     This includes children who cycle to school.     Moreover, they have not been able to make any allow-ance for the increase in road accidents that may result from the fact that fog
and ice are more prevalent early in the day that they are in the evening.Thus it can only be said that C. E. T. would make a small difference to road safety, and the difference would only probably be favourable.18.     The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents has recently written to the Home Office re-affirming their  views expressed in I960 in favourof C. E. T.      Among others who surmise that the change would leadto fewer road  accidents   are the British Medical Association and the police(both in England and Scotland).Public Health19. The Royal College of Nursing and Royal College of Midwives were amongthe bodies consulted in I960 and both then favoured C. E. T. , but gave noreasons for the preference.ZO.   In the opinion of the Ministry of Health the issue does not give rise toany significant health considerations, and for that reason no further inquiryhas been made of the medical or nursing organisations.     We are informed,however, that the Ambulance Service of the Greater London Council stronglyfavour the adoption of C. E. T.   for the reason that the sudden change from day to night driving under the present arrangements slows down the movement of patients.Education21.   In England and Wales there has been a marked change in the views ofthe educational interests.    In I960 the organisations consulted were not infavour of C. E. T. for fear of road accidents to children.    Now of the thirteenteachers&apos; and local authority associations consulted eight are in favour of it,the remainder wishing mainly to retain the present arrangements.     While theviews of the education authorities are divided and somewhat uncertain, all theprincipal teachers&apos; organisations - including the National Union of Teachers,the National Association of Schoolmasters, and the National Association ofHead Teachers - come out positively in favour of the change.22.   In this the governing consideration remains travelling conditions for thechildren to and from school.     The predominant view is that while there is alack of clear evidence of the effects of the change on road accidents to children(see paragraph 17 above) the extra hour of daylight it would bring in the evening should help to reduce the risk of assaults on children on their wayhome.     The National Union of Teachers and the National Association of school Masters suggest that there could be compensatory changes in the timing of school sessions.    School Governors already have power to vary the hours.This would follow the practice adopted during the war years when the time ofmorning session of school was changed from 9 a. m.  to 12 noon to 9. 30 a. m.to 12. 30. p. m.
23.   A different view is put by the National Farmers Union.     They draw attention to the problem of children in rural areas, who will frequently have long distances to walk to school in the dark during the winter months sinceschool buses are not provided for journeys under three miles.     Theyconsider that parents of young children will be reluctant to allow them to do this,  and that this will be another factor which will build up the antipathyof workers and their wives to living and working in rural areas.24.   In Scotland by contrast to England and Wales, where all the principalorganisations of teachers and a majority of other representative bodies inthe educational field favoured C. E. T. , the main educational interests asScatiasad. favour the status,  quo.   Little is offered in the way of supportingargument.      But resistance to C. E. T. is seen to be stronger in the morerural areas, especially those in the north and west of the country, wherechildren have generally to travel greater distances to attend school.     Theadditional daylight at the end of the school day is not thought to compensate for the loss of daylight at the beginning of the school day when travel conditionsare generally more difficult in winter months.     The possibility of varying thehours of school attendance was considered but was thought to present diffi-culties;   two examples given were the unde sir ability of children travellingduring the evening rush hour and of after school activities having to be curtailed:   no doubt also a starting time of 9 a. m. is more convenient whereboth parents work.Local Authorities25.   In England and Wales of the five local authority associations consulted the Greater London Council, the Association of Municipal Corporations (by over two-thirds majority), and the Urban District Councils Association werein favour of   C. E. T.     The County Councils Association - by the casting vote of the Chairman - and the Rural District Councils Association wished toretain the present arrangements.26.   No reasons were given for these decisions apart from those expressedby the Ambulance Service of the Greater London Council and referred toin paragraph 20 above.     They seem likely in part to have been influenced byeducational considerations.     For the rest, it is probably significant thatthe three organisations representing urban authorities favoured change whilethe two representing the more rural communities did not.27.    In Scotland;again by contrast^the majority opinion was against change.The only body in this field to favour C, E. T. was the District councils association, who were attracted by the extra light for open air activities inthe evening.     The Association of County Councils were opposed by a majority
of 17 to 8,  reasons not being particularised.     The Convention of Royal Burghswere also opposed, drawing attention to the 10 a. m. sunrise in Inverness.Of the Counties of Cities only Aberdeen supported C. E. T. , among points made were the coldness of the mornings before sunrise and doubt whetherthe extra daylight in the evening did not end too soon for recreational use.Crime28.   Neither the Metropolitan Police nor the Association of Chief police officers of England and Wales consider that a change to C. E. T. would have any marked effect on crime in this country.    A change would, however,make for better communications and possibly greater co-operation with european Police Forces.Industrial Welfare29.   We are advised by the Ministry of Labour that this issue should in no way affect accidents to workers in factories,  shops and offices.    Our concernwas chiefly to discover how the welfare of workers might be affected throughearly rising, travel conditions and so on, but on this we have received littleenlightenment.30.   The Confederation of British Industry were known to be strongly Infavour of C. E. T. on economic grounds and more particularly as facilitatingcontacts with the Common Market.    Not unnaturally they found it difficultto divorce social considerations from these other aspects.    In dealing withthe social implication for work-people they suggested that the change mightbe introduced on an experimental basis for perhaps two or three years andthat the problems might also be eased by alteration in the hours of certainkinds of employment (and in schools).    They also acknowledged that thedifficulties in adopting C. E. T. would be more pronounced in Scotland thanin other parts of the country.     However their Scottish Office    was equallyin favour of the change, referring to the social benefits to be derived fromthe longer evenings for leisure activities.31.   More surprising is the switch of opinion by the Trades Union Congress.Whereas in I960 at least half the unions were opposed to C. E. T. , we are nowtold that of the unions expressing a view those representing over five millionmembers would prefer C. E. T. , while those representing no more than a quarter of a million would prefer the present arrangements to continue.     Thechief reason given is Britain&apos;s prospective entry into the Common  Market.It is also said that a reduction in accidents in the building and construction industries could be expected owing to a reduction in the hours of twilight.The Scottish Trades Union Congress are just as categorical in their supportof C. E. T. , and as uninformative.
32.   In conformity with the views expressed by individual organisations inI960 the Sports Council;which is concerned with amateur sport, is clear thatthe adoption of C. E. T. would be the most advantageous course for sportinginterests as securing longer daylight in the winter afternoon.     This too is theview of profession football.     The change would mean for instance that wintermatches could begin at 3 p. m. instead of 2.15 p. m., to the greater convenience of the public.     The Tun authorities, however, favour retaining the present arrangements because of trainers&apos; difficulties over a late start in gettinghorses out to exercise in winter mornings.33.   It was not thought necessary to obtain the views of the entertainmentindustry;   but since its activities are largely confined to the afternoons andevenings the adoption of C. E. T. could scarcely fail to be in its interestsPublic Opinion34.   The Women&apos;s Royal Voluntary Service have reported that over two-thirds of the County and County Borough Organisers consulted in England and Walesfavoured C. E. T. , adding that even the more northerly counties seemedprepared to accept the inconvenience   involved.     Excluding considerations of a kind which the organisation is not really in the best position to assess,the chief reasons given for their preference were that there would be longerevenings- for children to play out of doors, that young people would be able toextend their sporting activities,  that old people visiting afternoon clubs would more often be able to go home in daylight, and that, generally, time changeshad a disturbing effect on old and young people and on animals.     They also considered that the change would simplify arrangements for holiday travel tothe continent.35.   A sample survey carried out by Gallup Poll on behalf of the ConsumerCouncil showed that of those questioned 45% favoured C. E. T. , 25%preferred the present arrangements,  and 29% did not mind one way or  another. Support for the change was less strong among women thanamong men, among those not at work than among those working.    among those who favoured a change only 1 in 45 could give a reason and of those whofavoured the . -status quo   only 1 out of 3.     The survey was conducted as partof an inquiry relating to other matters and it seems that not too much reliancecan be placed upon it.    It does, however, tend to confirm the impression thatat least In England and Wales much of the public is in a mood for change,though without perhaps being altogether sure why.
36.     Although the Consumer Council survey included Scotland  the samplethere was too small to be really meaningful.      Voting by a wide cros s - sectionof the membership of the Womens Royal Voluntary Service in Scotland produced a small majority in favour of C. E. T. , it being explained that those in favourhad regard to Common Market and Tourism conditions (this agrees with theviews of the Scottish Tourist Board).     It was also suggested that light eveningsdeterred juvenile delinquency.      The Townswomen&apos;s Guild,  on the other hand,had a two-thirds majority for C. E. T. , in contrast with the Scottish Women&apos;sRural Institutes who, on agricultural grounds, favoured Greenwich Mean Timethroughout the year;   but neither the Guild nor the Institutes were able totake a canvass of member s opinions.
37.   The economic aspects of the adoption of C.E. T. have been examined bya separate group of officials under Department of Economic Affairschairmanship.    It became clear at an early stage that the necessary material was not available to make possible a comprehensive analysis ofthe economrc costs and benefits of the adoption of C.E. T.    nevertheless the Working Party have tried where possible to assess the various considerations which arise in quantitative terms.    The economic considerations fall under three main heads :-(i)   Effects on output, productivity, labour costs, etc. with particular reference to the construction industries and agriculture;(ii)  Effects on transport, communications and tourism;(iii)   Effects on consumption of fuel and power.EFFECTS ON OUTPUT, PRODUCTIVITY, ETC.38.  Apart from possible effects on travelling conditions to and from work  the adoption of C. E. T. would not greatly affect the working conditions ofthe majority of the working population who work indoors.    Part of thewinter working day in factories, offices, shops, etc. is already carried cut in artificial light and the precise time at which the lights are switched on oroff is of no great consequence.     The matter is, however, much moreimportant in those industries in which a great deal of the work is carriedon out of doors - notably the construction industries (building and civil engineering) and agriculture.Construction Industries39.   The change would have both advantages and disadvantages for theconstruction industries and there is a conflict of views a,bout the net effecton them of the adoption of C. E. T.40.   The problem was considered by the Winter Building Advisory Committee,a body appointed by the Minister of Public Building and Works , a majority of whose members considered that the advantages out-weighted the disadvantage.The principle advantage which they saw in the change lies in the possibility that more hours of daylight could be made available for working in the winter months.    At present on G.M.T. there are periods when there is sufficientdaylight to begin work before 7. 30 a.m. , but this cannot be used because7.30 a.m. is the earliest normally acceptable starting time, even thoughwork is carried on into darkness in the evenings during such periods.41.  C. E. T. would make more of these daylight hours available, and theeffect of this can be seen from the table in Appendix C showing the times ofsunrise, sunset and the theoretical earliest and latest working light in the approximate latitude of Ipswich.    An 8.00 a.m. start on C.E.T. wouldlengthen the available daylight hours significantly in early and late wintercompared to a 7,30 a.m. start on G.M. T. and, particularly as thesetheoretical figures for available daylight hours rather overstate the amountof time actually adequate for building work without the use of artificial
HQlighting, this should promote efficiency.     The improvement would, however,tend to diminish further north of this latitude and in Scotland no adjustment toclocks can alter the fact that a full working day in winter must require the useof artificial lighting.42.  Against this advantage however, must be set other disadvantagesincurred in making the change.    An earlier start to work in some winter months would mean more trouble with early morning frosts anduncomfortable working conditions,   which would lead to delays in gettingbuilding operations started at their proper rhythm.    Both workers&apos; travel and deliveries of materials (mainly ready-mixed concrete, the timing of whose arrival on site is important) would be more likely to coincide withthe rush-hour and so be subject to delay.    Finally, the national negotiationsneeded to alter the official starting times (a 7.30 a.m. C.E. T. startthroughout the winter would be harmful as can be seen from the Annexe andfor maximum efficiency work would need to start at 8. 00 a. m. C.E.T. in early and late winter and 8.30 a.m. C.E.T. in mid-winter) would belikely to involve concessions on pay or conditions.43.  The National Federation of Building Trades Employers who were consulted considered that these disadvantages would add as much as 1 to ljper cent to the cost of new building work, or more than  20 million a year.The Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors, whilst declining to give an estimate, also thought that in civil engineering the disadvantages andextra costs would be significant.    Neither body seems to have felt that thetheoretically longer daylight hours available would much offset these extracosts.44.   The views of the builders and civil engineers are probably undulypessimistic.     We do not think they have attached sufficient importance tothe extra daylight hours available and we think that the Winter BuildingAdvisory Committee were right in thinking that this is a significantadvantage.    In particular we think that the calculation of the extra buildingcosts is unreliable and, probably overstates their size.    Nevertheless itseems doubtful whether there would be a significant net advantage in adopting C.E.T. in construction and in this field the cost of the changemight well exceed the benefit.Agriculture45.   Broadly the same considerations apply to agriculture as are outlined above in respect of the construction industries.     Farm work is stillbasically an out-door occupation, even though the widespread development ofelectric lighting, heating, etc. provides more scope for productive work in conditions of cold and darkness than would have been the case some yearsago.    These developments may in part account for the fact that the views of farmers, as represented by the N. F. U. , though still opposed to theadoption of C.E. T. appear now   to be less strongly opposed than in the past.U
The N. F. U. argue that C. E. T. would mean more overtime working andmore time spent unprofitably while on duty.    The N. F.U. foresee greatdifficulty in getting workers to agree to an adjustment of their mormal times of starting work and point to the fact that when the standard numberof hours (beyond which wages at overtime rates become payable) is reduced the workers always insist that the reduction should be at the endof the day.     They calculate that if each of the 283, 000 full-time maleworkers in agriculture needed to do an extra seven hours a week (at7s. 4d. an hour) for&apos; the twenty-one weeks of winter the total cost to theindustry would be  15 million.    Not all workers would in fact be requiredto work this overtime but the N. F. U. consider that the loss of productionattributable to the wasted hours of darkness would more than offset this.In addition they estimate that the consumption of electricity on farms would go up by at least   1   million a year, giving a total increase in costs ofabout  17 million a year.     The N.F.U. Scotland put forward the same general view, and the Scottish Landowners Federation, while expressingthemselves as neutral on the question did recognise that C.E.T. presentedsome social benefits .46.  The views on the trade union side appear to differ.    The N.U.A.W.consider that the adoption of C.E.T. would have little if any, economicdisadvantage within the industry and that there would be certain socialadvantages.     The agricultural section of the T.G.W.U. as regards bothEnglish and Scottish workers&apos; interests would prefer the present arrangements to continue but would not object to the adoption of C.E. T. ifmost of the interested parties favoured the change.47.   Our own conclusion is again that it is doubtful whether much relianceshould be placed on the estimate of increased cost quoted in Paragraph 45above.     The assumption on which it is based - that a change in working hours could not be secured (or only at considerable cost) may be toopessimistic.     On the other hand the N.F. U. are probably right in thinking that the unions would expect to be able to secure some improvement in payor conditions in return for such a change.EFFECTS ON TRANSPORT, COMMUNICATIONS AND TOURISMRoads48.  The effects of the adoption of C. E. T. on road safety are discussed inparagraphs 15 to 18 of the section on the social aspects of C.E.T.     if however, the tentative net savings in accidents suggested in thoseparagraphs are used as a basis, the total economic value, on the basis of1964 figures, would be just over  800,000 per annum, exclusive of any allowance for suffering and distress.    This figure would be about 10%higher on the basis of current prices and 1966 accident rates.     The netsaving might, however, be less than this because of the possible effects ofadverse weather conditions,  on accidents and traffic congestion, or moreif there were favourable changes in the travelling habits of the public.
Railways49.  British Rail have confirmed the view expressed in the previousconsultations in I960 that the adoption of C.E. T. would, on balance, be ofbenefit to them, primarily because it would simplify international travel,but also because it would save trouble with domestic timetables and might,they suggest, perhaps help to encourage travel in off peak seasons.    Theyhave been unable to quantify the benefit.Ports50.   The British Transport Docks Board also support the adoption of C.E.T.but they, too, are unable to put a value on it.     The greatest benefit wouldbe felt at those ports which have a considerable trade with Continentalships and cargo.International transport51.  British airline operators (both nationalised and private) would welcomeadoption of C.E. T. on a permanent basis.    The chief benefit would besimplification of the task of preparing time-tables, but there would be other advantages such as scope for harmonisation of the schedules forBritish operators with those of Continental operators.     The present arrangements are complicated by the fact that the standard Europeanairline summer and winter time-table periods do not coincide with presentperiods for G.M.T. and summer time.    As a result, four differentscheduling periods are necessary in each year - an administrativecomplication and a source of confusion to the travelling public.    Air traffic control units and centres work on CM. T. in any case, since this is theinternational standard for aircraft movements, and would be little affectedby any change.52.  Broadly similar considerations apply to rail and sea service operatingbetween the United Kingdom and the Continent.Tourism53.   The British travel trade has welcomed the extension of summer time,begun in 1961 to cover the period from the end of March to the end ofOctober.    It has been found that this has encouraged the taking of additionalholidays and day trips both at the beginning and end of the main holidayseason.    There is no obvious advantage to the travel and holiday trade ina move to C.E. T.    Nevertheless the general feeling in the trade appears tobe in favour of its adoption, if only because of the simplification which itwould bring to time-tables.Telephone and Telex Contact with the Continent54.   The views of the Confederation of British Industry and the Associationof British Chambers of Commerce were sought and in addition commentswere offered by the British National Export Council, the London CommodityExchange Co. Ltd. and the Multiple Shops Federation.
55.   The general concensus of opinion strongly favoured adoption of C.E.T.The arguments advanced centred on the convenience of keeping in step withthe Continent throughout the year but the replies did not quantify thebenefits, only qualitative judgments being given.    In addition to the gainsin contact time with European Offices, conformity with continental practicewas a principal merit within the context of possible United Kingdom entry to the E. E. C.56.  Although no quantitative analysis was attempted clearly there would be again in business contact hours with Europe and this might be. in the region of 20%.     The general business hours in a selection of European countries,as shown in Appendix D, indicates that effective common working hours withthe United Kingdom on G.M.T. amounts to some Z\ hours in the morning and about 2jf hours in the afternoon.    With the United Kingdom on C. E. T. ,those times would increase by one hour in the morning and a quarter hourafter lunch.     This is likely to be of benefit to exporters.EFFECTS ON CONSUMPTION OF FUEL AND POWER57.   The adoption of C.E.T. would have the effect of causing people to getup and go to bed earlier (with regard to daylight hours) than with G.M. T.This produces two effects on the demand for fuel.58.  First, since it is normally colder at the time that most people rise(i. e. about dawn in the winter) than it is at the time they go to bed, C.E. T.increases the need for fuel for heating purposes.    It is not thoughtpracticable to put a figure on the economic cost of the extra fuel that wouldbe used for this purpose.59.  Secondly, there is the effect of adoption of C.E. T. on the use of fuelfor lighting.    Because, except in mid-winter, most people do not riseuntil after day-break, the effect of summer time throughout the summer andto a lesser extent in the spring and autumn as well is to reduce the need fDrlighting.     However, if summer time continued through the darkest monthsof the year, the saving of fuel for lighting in the evening would be largelyoffset by extra use in the morning.60.  The effect of changes in time on the amount of plant which theelectricity industry requires could be considerable, given that electricity,unlike other fuels, has to be produced simultaneously with consumption.At present there are two main weekday peaks in electricity consumption - inthe early morning and late afternoon - both partly the result of the coincidenceof the residential and working lighting loads.     Under present conditions, the morning peak is smaller than the afternoon peak.    If summer time were continued throughout winter the afternoon peak would become slightly-smaller and the morning peak larger.     The electricity industry believes that the morning peak would in fact become greater than the afternoon peakis at present and they have estimated that as a result the extra generating capacity needed in Great Britain might be increased by anything up to 500 MW.
The capital cost of the extra plant needed for electricity production anddistribution on this scale might be up to  40 million.    There is, however,considerable doubt about the accuracy of this estimate and it is possiblethat the requirement for extra generating capacity could be much smaller.There seems no reason to doubt, however, that some extra capacity wouldbe required.61.   The electricity industry, although short of generating capacity atpresent, expects to have ample capacity by 1969.    There should, therefore,be adequate time to make new plans to ensure that there are no shortages of plant in the 1970s.    But the scale of the additional cost which might be needed to provide extra generating capacity and the difficulty of making any firm estimate point to the desirability of an experimental trial, if this couldbe arranged.62.  Apart from the special case of the electricity industry, the views and interests of the fuel industries are not significantly different from those ofindustry generally.     The National Coal Board and the Electricity council have expressed the view that present arrangements are a little easier forshift working, although a majority of the Gas Boards have expressedthemselves in favour of adoption of C. E. T. throughout the year.
General63.  It seems that in England and Wales the social considerations tend in favour-------of the adoption of C. E. T. , and this course has clear majority support among all sections of opinion consulted.    It would be difficult to draw up aconvincing balance sheet to illustrate why it should be so, since the views expressed - in so far as reasons are given at all - rest more on predictionthan on reliable deduction, experience or ascertainable fact.    Comparativelyrarely (perhaps only in the field of sport and entertainment) are the issuesclear cut.    Often, as with road accidents, the balance of advantage isdubious, or at best marginal, or the conclusions turn, as in the educationalfield, on the finest of judgments.64.  It appears that in this situation the scale has often been tipped by considerations transcending the purely social^such for instance - andexplicity in the views obtained from the Confederation of British Industry andthe Trades Union Congress - as the prospect of Britain&apos;s entry into theCommon Market.     There is some evidence, as one would expect, that achange to C.E.T. would be less acceptable in the rural thanin the urban areas-  but, that apart, the one conclusion that emerges withdefiniteness is that, for whatever reasons, the bulk of representative opinion is now in a mood for change.65.   In Scotland the position is different.     Opinions were divided but, on balance there is a general and understandable concern over the lengthenedperiods of morning darkness.    It seems clear that those who favouredC. E. T. mostly did so with economic considerations (Common Market andTourism) very much in mind.    Particularly against the background of doubt about the probable effect on road safety, it would seem that the adoption ofC.E. T. in Scotland would not generally be regarded as justifiable unless itwas established that substantial economic advantages would result.66.  This, however,  cannot be done.    As explained in paragraph 37 of thisReport, it was not possible for us to make a comprehensive analysis of theeconomic costs and benefits of the adoption of C.E.T.    In the variousparagraphs of Part III of this Report estimates appear of the monetary costof changes expected in certain industries, but these vary widely not only in size but in the degree of reliance which should be placed on them.Accordingly no attempt has been made to arrive at a balance sheet of prosand cons.67.   The most that can be said is that there would be some distinct benefits,such as improved contacts with the Continent, but that these are notquantifiable.    Equally there would be disadvantages, for example, in theconstruction and agricultural industries.    Again these are not easilyquantifiable, but are not likely to be very large in amount.    Accordinglythere seems to be no overriding economic consideration pointing one way&apos;orthe other.
68.  Treated purely as a domestic issue the choice, therefore, turns uponwhether the clear preference for C.E.T. expressed in England and Wales by those consulted on the social aspects of the question, are thought sufficient to outweigh any feeling in Scotland.- and possibly among rural communitiesgenerally - where the effect will be a good deal more pronounced^that their interests are being subordinated to those of England, or of the urbancommunities, without any demonstrable balance of economic advantage.But the issue cannot be treated exclusively in those terms.    It seems to us that the instinct of many of those consulted was right, in that neither theeconomic nor the social issues can be divorced from the much wider considerations now raised by the prospect of Britain&apos;s entry into theCommon Market with all that it may require in a closer identification withContinental practices.Legislative Implications69.  If it were decided to introduce C. E. T. the legislation required for thepurpose should not, we believe, present serious technical difficulty.    Ashort Bill of one or two clauses might suffice.    If such a Bill were to beintroduced at the beginning of next Session it might be possible for it tocomplete all its stages by the end of the year-  but clearly C.E. T. ought not to be introduced half way through the winter when the change back fromSummer Time to Greenwich Mean Time has already once been made.    for practical purposes, therefore, the earliest that the legislation could take effect would be in the winter of 1968/69, and a further Order would need tobe made under the existing Acts for the introduction of Summer Time inthe spring of next year.70.  We see little reason either on social or economic grounds why anychange should be deferred beyond the winter of 1968/6&apos;9.     Particularly ifthe intention to legislate is announced within the next two months when the summer Time Order in respect of 1968 is made, we believe that in generalthe interests concerned will receive ample notice to make whateveradjustments may be required e.g. to working hours.    More particularly,we are told (see paragraph 61 above) that the electricity generating induscryshould by 1969 have ample capacity to meet whatever additional morning&apos;loadthe change may create.71.  The question arises, however, whether the change should in the firstplace be introduced experimentally e.g. for a period of three years with provisions for review after that time.    In favour of this it can be argued that neither the social nor the economic effects are sufficiently calculable tomake the change anything but a risk;   that the public who have had no experience (except in the altogether untypical circumstances of wartime)1 ofthe cold and dark winter mornings that would result might find when they had that it was far from their liking;   and that those industries and sections ofopinion opposed to the change might more readily be brought to accept it onan experimental basis, and indeed might then find it - as many of them have found the extended Summer Time introduced by the 1964 Order - moretolerable than they had ever expected.
72.  The contrary argument is that if the change is found to be unacceptablethe Act can always be repealed and Greenwich Mean Time reinstated by further legislation;  that so long as it is thought to be no more thanexperimental the opposed interests will have the less incentive to adjustthemselves to it and the more to demonstrate its disadvantages;  and thatthe majority of representative opinion which appears now to be in favour of change is likely to welcome a clear-cut decision and be impatient of what might appear to them to be further temporising.
