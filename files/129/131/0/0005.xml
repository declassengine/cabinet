C.Treasury Chambers, S. &quot;W.1.16th June, 1967
THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OP PUBLIC expenditure note by officials the main purpose of the Public Expenditure Survey is to help theG-overnment to make decisions about the level and composition of public expenditure.     These decisions imply a view as to how much of the nation&apos;resources should be absorbed by the public sector and as to how the shareso pre-empted should be allocated between competing claims.     They also imply a view about the acceptability of additional taxation even when, becauseonly transfer payments are involved, there is no need to divert resources from private use to employment in the public sector.2,     (a)   ResourcesThe more is reserved for public use the less is left for personal consumption and private investmente     On the side of consumptionthis means taking a decision how needs are best satisfied and howfar raising the standards of collective consumption should take precedence over improvements in personal consumption.     On the side of investment, it means a decision how far the contemplateddivision of capital investment between the public and private sector is appropriate,(b)   TransfersIn addition, there are also decisions concerning the redistribution of, income between persons, whether by means of progressive taxes,changes in tax allowances or transfer payments,,3.     The public expenditure programmes should be devised and presented insuch a way that Ministers can most easily make these decisions in accordancewith their order of priorities.A.     The present paper aims at making two major points in this connection.One is that the definition of &quot;public expenditure&quot; should be based on logicaland consistent principles;    the other is that the economic effects (from thepoint of view of taxation and the balance of payments) of different kinds of expenditure, should be separately evaluated so as to make it possible for ministers to decide on relative priorities by more appropriate criteria thanthose based on crude money outlay alone.
The definition of public expenditure ,    Y/ith regard to the first point, any definition of public expenditure is bound to be somewhat arbitrary.     One could say, for instance, that it is thetotal of outlays on goods and services, on current and capital transfers, andon net lending to other sectors.     But this definition is less clear cut thanappears at first sight.     For instance, expenditure on goods and services,where these are provided in exchange for a charge, are usually excluded.     Butthis is not always the case:    the employment of sales staff in stationery office shops has constituted part of public expenditure while that of minershas not, although in each case the public pays a charge covering the cost ofthe goods or services it has bought,6.     vThile what is included in the definition is to some extent arbitraryin logic, it is important to include and arrange material in such a way thatthe effective options are as clearly presented as possible.     It is forconsideration whether any reform is needed to the definitions at present used.There are perhaps two main questions here.     The first concerns whether ornot the investment of nationalised industries should be included in public expenditure.     The main point at issue here is whether or not fundamentallydifferent criteria should apply as between such investment and other public investment.     Can it, for instance, be said that an inadequate investment ingenerating stations by the CEG-B, so that there are electricity cuts, producesill effects different in kind from inadequate investment in roads orhospitals?     Secondly, it should be considered whether the present distinctionbetween some transfer payments (e.gi family allowances) which are included among outlays on the expenditure side and other items (such as income taxchild allowances) which appear as offsets to taxation on the receipts sideof the accounts is really meaningful.     Is such a distinction convenient forthe purpose of making decisions about the redistribution of personal consumption, whether this is attained by means of progressive taxation or bymeans of transfer payments financed either out of general taxation or out ofhypothecated levies (like social insurance contributions)?7a     One possibility is that there should be a separate consideration at ministerial level, similar to the Ministerial consideration of public expenditure policy, of all proposals relating to income redistribution, sothat priorities can be assigned.     In this consideration there would beincluded, besides rates of benefits and assistance, policy on personaltaxation including tax allowances, on the contribution structure for national insurance, and on the relationship between local rates and central taxation.This would provide an opportunity, for instance, of comparing proposals suchas that for rate rebates with other proposals for assisting similar categories of persons that would involve &quot;public expenditure&quot; as defined in PESC.     Theneed for something like this is clear in the case of the proposals now beingconsidered for cuts in public expenditure programmes, among which increases in charges for various G-overnnental services may form an important part.     Itwould be useful to be able to consider systematically at the same timepossibilities of making th^^te^^,^^.essive.
HP&quot;8.     This would still permit transfer payments to he considered ^7ithin thePESC procedure although it would not he possible, without making the PESCReport undesirably complicated, to deal in it with such closely connectednatters as tax allowances.     It would also be unnecessary to make firm decisions so far in advance for transfer payments as for most categories of direct expenditure on economic resources, where forward planning is indispensable either on technical grounds or in the interests of economicefficiency.9. In whatever way the decisions are arrived at, the point of importance is that the material should be presented in such a way as to bring out the effective range of choice.The economic ranking of different types of expenditure10.    .7ith regard to the second point, we would not question, of course, that whatever definition of public expenditure is adopted, it will always benecessary to add together the various component elements in order to arriveat the total bill, expressed as a money outlay, which the Government will haveto pay.     This, roughly speaking, is the function performed by the presentpublic expenditure survey.11. But this, for the purpose of analysis and evaluation, is only a first step, because different kinds of outlay have very different effects on the economy.     The two main points are:-(a)   An outlay on transfers (e.g. pensions or family allowances) is likelyto generate an addition to the domestic pressure of demand onlya half to two-thirds as great as an outlay on the direct purchaseof domestically produced goods and services.     That a difference of this order exists will be apparent if one considers first thatthe outlay in each case creates roughly the same amount of privateincome and therefore of private expenditure.     For instance, 1 ,000 spent on employing an extra traffic warden creates roughlythe same private income and consumption as  1 ,000 spent on, say,family allowances.     But in the first case only, where theG-overnment is purchasing goods or services directly, the pressure on resources following from this purchase is additional to theprivate expenditure brought about by the increase in incomes.     Inother words the rest of the community is deprived of the servicesof the traffic warden in another capacity (say as night watchman)in one case but not in the other.
Moreover, when a worker is transferred from the private sectorto the public sector, the loss in the value of output from theprivate sector is likely to be considerably greater than theaddition to the value of output in the public sector because,since expenditure on Government services does not generate any element of profit, output per head in the public sector is much lower than in the private sector.     In other words, an increasein the proportion of the working population employed by theGovernment reduces the productive potential of the economy.     Thismeans that if it is desired to hold the pressure of demand constantwhen a transfer of labour takes place it is necessary to raisetaxes so as to reduce personal consumption of domestic output bymore than the equivalent increase in output absorbed by the public sector.     Different types of transfer payment can also havedifferent effects on the pressure of demand depending on the amountof savings and tax &quot;flow back&quot; which are generated.     For instance 100 million gross spent on family allowances will have less impact on demand than  100 million spent on supplementary benefits,since family allowances are taxable,(b)   The import content of different kinds of Government expenditurevaries from 100 per cent in the case of (say) military expenditureabroad to nil in the case of expenditure on direct services(e,g. those of civil servants) at home.     This is another important consideration in deciding on the ranking of different types ofGovernment expenditure.12.   In the United Kingdom the overall level of taxation (for any given set of public expenditure decisions) is determined entirely by the need to obtainthe right pressure of demand at home and an adequate surplus in our balanceof payments.     There is no need to &quot;balance the budget&quot; in the old-fashionedsense, and the crude relationship between money outlays and receipts has verylittle importance.     It follows, if the argument in the previous paragraphis correct, that the maximum rate of growth in total public expenditure that can be afforded depends critically on its composition.     The different economic-effects are of paramount importance whether it is the relative costs ofdifferent expenditure or the desirable level of total expenditure which isunder review.-4-
HM Treasury, S.T7,1 .19th June 196713.   The conclusion hero is that in presentation of public expenditure programmes, it is not sufficient to include all the individual outlays interms of sums of money to be paid out of the Exchequer.     It is necessarythat they should rank according to their economic effects.     In so far as thisis possible, the real costs of any outlay in terms of the need to raiseadditional taxation, or of the deterioration it is likely to cause in thebalance of payments, should be brought into equivalence vuth the costs ofother outlays.
