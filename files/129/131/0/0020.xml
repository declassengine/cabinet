AID AND THE BALANCE OF payments memorandum by the Minister of Overseas development the relation between G-overnment overseas expenditure and the balanceof payments has been raised in the context of defence, and my colleagues may find it convenient to have my comments on this matter in relation to expenditure under the aid programme.2,    Much care has been taken in the design of the aid programme to minimise the burden which it places on the balance of payments.    This isin particular the object of tying aid to the purchase by the recipient ofUnited Kingdom exports, but there are also other features of the programme which have the same broad economic effects    Detailed studies of theseeffects have been carried out by my officials in consultation with otherDepartments.     I do not propose to burden my colleagues with thesebut   the    conclusion which has been reached, is that  100 ofadditional aid will under present provisions generate a return flow ofpayments for additional exports of goods and services of about  65.Conversely, a reduction of  100 in aid expenditure would bring a saving of only  35 on the balance of payments.    For practical purposes this amountsto saying that the direct balance of payments cost of the aid programme isabout 35$$ of the gross expenditure *3*    In the longer term other factors come into play which would furtherreduce the burdens    These factors have also been carefully studied.    Asubstantial part of the aid programme consists of loans which generatea flow of repayments, and a proportion of which also generate interest.   In1966/67 we received  61 million by way of interest and repayments of aidloans made in previous years.A.
4a     Further, it has to be remembered that the United Kingdom aid programme is part of an international system of aid giving whose parts to some extenthang together in a mutual relation.    By giving aid on a certain scale wehave some impact on the amount of aid given by the United States and otherdonors including the international agencies *      There is little doubt thatthe operation of this system as a whole is advantageous to the UnitedKingdom balance of paymentse    This is because the United Kingdom has a substantially bigger share in the import trade of the less developed countries collectively than she has in the world aid flow, and in spite ofthe widespread tying of aid the United Kingdom exports generated by worldaid probably exceed United Kingdom expenditure on aid.    This isparticularly true of the International Development Association of whosefunds we provide 13$* while o^er 20$ of the resulting export orders cometo this country.3a    Finally, the effect of aid in strengthening the economies of thebeneficiary comtries has a certain feed-back to the United Kingdom balanceof payments through the improvement of supplying industries, the creationof situations in which development take-offs may occur so that world marketsare augmented, and through the reduction of causes of tension in the world.Such consequences are inherently hard to measure and take time to berealised frtrt this does not mean that they are negligible.6.    Taking all these considerations together, it does not seem unreasonable to conclude that the balance of payments impact of the aid programme is not much out of line with that of public expenditure generally.A.Gr.BoMinistry of Overseas Development,London, S.W.1.28th June. 1967
