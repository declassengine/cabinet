EKEKBS BXPElNDITUllS rSTUDIESMemorandum by the Defence and Oversea Policy (Official) CommitteeV.re have considered the attached report by the Defence Review YforkingParty, which brings together the results of the defence expenditurestudios commissioned by Ministers last December (OPD(66) 48th Meeting,Confidential innex).     ITe agree with the report of the Forking Party;and we draw attention to the following points which arise on it.2.     T/e have considered whether the findings in the report may require modification as a result of recent events in the Middle East and theirrepercussions in that area and elsewhere.     Although it Is too early to judge how the situation in the Middle East will develop, even in theshortrun, we must recognise that it may require some acceleration in theproposed tilling of our withdrawal from our remaining commitments in thearea.     But, oven if this proved to he the case, we doubt whether itwould materially affect the level of defence expenditure contemplated in the report for 1970-71 and 1975-76.Our position in the world3.     The report accepts that, since the defence expenditure studies wereinitiated, there has been no slackening in the economic pressures onthis country which made those studies necessary;    and it forecasts thatthese pressures, together with other potential developments, will mean that &quot;by the mid-1970s we shall have ceased to play a world-wide militaryrole.     T/e agree with this assessment.     we shall increasingly &quot;become a European power;    and our international influence will depend more andmore on the soundness of our economy, rather than on our maintenance ofa military presence in the rest of the world.Defence Capabilities mid Commitments4.     The changes which are proposed in our planned defence programme will substantially reduce both the scale and the duration of themilitary operations in which we shall he able to engage and, therefore,the commitments that we can meet.     If the proposed changes are accepted, it will be essential to ensure that, as the capability of our forces is curtailed, there is a comparable reduction in our commitments.-i-
Specific decisions required on the defence programme and on aid5.     We draw particular attention to the decisions which are now required on the defence programme (paragraph 48 of the report).     As regardsmitigating aid, particularly for Singapore and Malaysia, we oustemphasise that, if the proposals in the report are accepted,expenditure of broadly the order indicated in paragraph 75 will be anessential element in the plan to withdraw our forces from Singapore/Malaysia by the mid-1970s.     A separate paper is being preparedseeking Ministerial approval of specific proposals in respect of aidbefore negotiations are started with the countries concerned.Ppljvri^Eagt of Suez6.     The report recommends (paragraph 51) that the decision whetheror not to provide ourselves with the capability to deploy our polaris submarines East of Suez need not be taken until October, since noquestion of committing expenditure to this end arises until then.     this issue does not affect the remainder of the report;    and it can best betaken in the light of an up-to-date political assessment at the time.7&apos;e agree with this recommendation;   but the necessary studies toprepare for a decision in October should be put in hand in good time.A pffltiffuin^ military capability in the Far East after 1975-767.     In order to provide a basis for costing the defence programme it isnecessary to make a specific assumption about the form of our continuingmilitary capability in the Far East after we have withdrawn from singapore/Malaysia.     The report assumes, for working purposes, a presencebased on facilities in Australia.     But this does not prejudge the way in which the capability would in fact be provided, since whether it usedAustralian facilities provided by the Government of Australia or usedfacilities provided by the Government of Singapore or was held in thiscountry for deployment as necessary in the Far East, its direct cost would not be likely to vary by more than about  10 million annually(though the different forms of deployment might have different implications-tions for our degree of involvement in the area).     A further study ofthis question will be made;    and a report will be submitted later.Pixjppjit at i on8.     Paragraph 80 of the report deals with the difficult issues which arise on the public presentation of our plans for the Far East.     Weendorse the conclusions of the report on this point, the Treasuryreservation being maintained.Cabinet Office, S.V7.1.21st June 1967 -ii-
.    TOP SECRETDEPICT EXPENDXTUSE STUDIES&quot;Jjg32 IlLJ.y ^ne Pe^encG ^view Working; party .    BtTRODUCTIONOriginal Basis of Studies1.     The basis of the Defence Expenditure Studies vdiich the Defence and oversea Policy Comnittee originally instructed us to carry out(OPD(66) 43th Mooting, Confidential Annex) was that further largereductions in the defence budget should bo secured by 1970-71 withoutannouncing a fundamental change in our external policies one year cfilyafter the completion of the Defence Review.2.     It was hoped that savings within a range of  200-300 million could be achieved by 1970-7&quot;! by making cuts in the Defence Review forcelevels of one-third in Europe, one-half in the Par East, includingHong Kong, some reduction in the Persian Gulf and In Cyprus, snd cutsin supporting forces and facilities in the United Kingdom.     The time-table for the completion of the studies was designed to permitMinisters to reach conclusions by tho middle of 1967.     The wish wasalso expressed by Ministers that they should form the last major reviewof defence policy in the life of the present Parliament;    and they havebeen presented publicly as a continuation, relating to 1970-71, of theDefence Preview published in 1 966 whioh related to 1969-70.3.     Underlying the Studies has been the severe restraint placed on the fulfilment   of our national economic objectives by the likely rate of growth of the economy and the balance of payments, the need to relieve the strain on the balance of payments by reducing Government overseaexpenditure, and the importance of containing public expenditurerigorously in order to strike a balance between the claims of the public and private sectors on the available resources.     Since the Studies werebegun, the economic and political pressures to reduce defence expenditurehave increased.     The timetable for tho Studies allows Ministers toconsider the results of then in parallel with the reviow of civil public expenditure in the context of the Government&apos;s general economic strategy.if.     Our interim report (0PD(67) 22) reached the tentative conclusion, onthe basis of the work done up to that point, that savings of only some 100-125 million could be achieved by 1970-71 within the confines of the assumptions set, although the same plans might yield a further saving ofabout  20-25 million in the years after 1970-71.     Further study has confirmed the validity of this conclusion.     These figures did not take account of transitional defence expenditure in the United Kingdom&apos;(such asredundancy payments) nor of any net increase in overseas aid.
New Guidance5,,     Officials therefore sought further guidance from   Ministers, and at its meeting on 22nd March (OPD(67) 14th Meeting, Item 2) the Defence and overseas policy Committee decided that we should look for greater savings, particularlyin the Far East.     7,re should go ahead with reducing our combat forces andemployment of local civilians in Singapore and Malaysia by the order of halfby 1970-71 and should aim to withdraw wholly from Singapore and Malaysia by1975-76, while not precluding the possibility of earlier withdrawal ifpolitical considerations made this feasible.6.     The reasons for the decision to plan further ahead and to regard 1970-71as a useful but nevertheless arbitrary point on the way towards a long-term policy of retrenchment outside Europe were, first, that this approach (inrespect of the Far East) would enable greater savings to be made (of the orderof  150-200 million) in 1970-71, and offered the prospect of a saving on thedefence budget as a whole of up to  300 million in 1975-76.     Secondly, itwas recognised that only by deciding our long-term aims in the Far East now,and shaping all our actions from now on with these in view, would, we have time to change our commitments and adjust the forces and their deploymentso as to achieve the forecast savings.     It was also necessary to have anadequate basis on which to plan the size and structure of the forces and their equipment programme, as decisions in these fields often needed to be takenmany more than three years in advance.     7&apos;hile clear-cut objectives for the mid-1970s were recognised as essential, it was also felt that there must be some flexibility in the timing of our achievement of them.Need for overall study beyond 1970-71,7.     For the same reasons of political and strategic policy and size and structure of the forces, it is essential to look further ahead than 1970-71not only in the Far East but also over the whole field of our defence policy.Because it takes so long for broad decisions of policy to be fully realised in terms of force reductions and expenditure savings, we should look now atthe role we envisage for the forces throughout the world in the mid-1970sand accordingly at their size and composition in that period.     Furthermorethe political studies that we have undertaken in accordance with the directionof Ministers also show the advantage of taking a longer-terra view cf our overseas policies (although, as we suggest in Section VI below, it would be highly inexpedient in some fields publicly to declare now what this view isand in other fields we should weigh carefully the advantages and disadvantages of declaring our intentions).     Tie cannot consider the size and shape of theforces without at the same time considering what our future obligations and commitments should.be, nor can further substantial reductions in defence expenditure be achieved -without reducing our present commitments,-2-
8.     Our commitments in Europe and in the Par East are those which haveby far the most significant effect on the size and equipment of the forces.The forces that on present plans we shall have overseas outside these twotheatres are not large, nor are they uniquely equipped.    We need to takea broad view of our future commitments in these other areas when consideringthe future size and shape of the forces, but a detailed timetable ofredeployment, which would in any case not be practicable &quot;at present for reasons to which we refer later, is not essential for purposes of militaryplanning.    Clearly, because the forces ?;e maintain in areas other thanthe Ear East and Europe are relatively small, the assumptions we make about their withdrawal will have less significance;    of much greater significance,however, are the assumptions we make about what our remaining commitmentsoutside Europe will be and about our capability for reinforcing our troopsin these areas from the United Kingdom.   Nevertheless even in these areasit is necessary to take broad decisions now if savings, particularly inthe support facilities we should maintain, are to be achieved over the nextfew years.9.     We have therefore felt it right to go somewhat beyond the tasks set by ministers and have reviewed our likely commitments and military requirements in all oversea   theatres, and their consequences for the forces as a whole,not only up to 1970-71 but also, in broader terms, up to the mid-1970s.10.    It must he recognised that, whatever we may plan now to accomplish bya particular year, events are not by any means within our control.Unforeseen operations involving British forces might delay, or perhaps evenreverse, the process of rundown.   Also, expenditure in any individual yearcan be distorted by particular items either in the equipment programme orin relation to the general redeployment.    It is of greater significance to look at the general policy at which we are aiming over a period rather thanthe particular levels of expenditure in a given year; but individual yearsmaybe of particular importance in relation to the G-overnment1 s expenditure programme as a whole.11.   In the following paragraphs we deal first with British policy overseas and the consequential role of our forces up to the mid-1970s.   We then gcon to report the outcome of the specific studiesiwhich llinisters instructedus to carry out and to state the size, shape and&apos;, cost, of both in budgetaryand foreign-exchange terns, of the forces required both in&apos; 1970-71 and 1975-76.Tie also consider the implications for our overseas aid.     Je finally examinethe problems of public presentation and the areas in which immediate decisions are required.
II.    OUR ROLE IN THE MID 1 970sDefence Commitments Overseas12.   We are in process of transition to a position in the world whollydifferent from that which we occupied at the end of the Second World War.Then we had large possessions, commitments and forces literally round theworld:   now we have comparatively small forces, few possessions (thoughscattered) and declining commitments.     The process of disengagement from our formal major commitments and military positions outside Europe is continuing, and we believe these processes will be largely completed by thesecond half of the 1970s.     If we have not wholly withdrawn from CENTO andSEATO,we shall at least have gone a long way towards doing so.     We are unlikely to have a defence commitment to Kuwait and we are unlikely to have any forces stationed permanently in the Persian Gulf.     If there is stillan Anglo-Malaysian Treaty after our withdrawal from the mainland of SouthEast Asia,we shall not be providing forces specifically to meet commitments for it alone.     We shall have no obligation to Brunei.     We shall not have extended the Defence Treaty with Libya which will therefore have beenterminated by 1973.     If we still have a commitment to the Republic of Cyprusunder the 1 9^0 Treaty we shall meet it, as now, out of our general capability.13.   This process of political and military disengagement will be aconsiderable strain upon our relations with our friends and allies and maybe subjected to modification both on this account and. because of externalevents over which we have no control.     Even if it is not modified, the timing of its achievement cannot be predicted with certainty.     We shall need tobe flexible both in timing and presentation.     In the difficult negotiationsinvolved we shall also need to make the most diplomatically of our remainingmilitary capabilities including particularly the mobility of our forces.14.   These capabilities cannot be related, wholly to specific commitmentssince we shall have to take account of the need to use them in such a way as to achieve maximum political influence as well as to meet unforeseencircumstances.     But subject to that, the main commitments we shall have inthe mid-1970s will be in Europe.     In addition we shall have a continuingmoral obligation to Australia and New Zealand.     The rest of our specificobligations and commitments will be small, though widely scattered.     We arelikely to have to provide forces in Hong Kong and some small forces in malta and Gibraltar and perhaps Cyprus.     We shall still remain responsible forthe administration, defence and internal security of a number of otherdependencies including probably Eiji, though in terms of forcesthis is primarily a problem of internal security,        We
TOP SECRET &apos;J u foare likely to have contimring.obligations to the Associated States, andto Mauritius and the Maldives, but in terms of forces these pose onlyproblems similar to those of our remaining dependencies.     We cannotexclude the possibility that we shall still have some tenuous obligations to the shaikhdoms of the Persian Gulf.     V/e shall have a continuingresponsibility to protect British subjects abroad though the extent towhich, and the manner in which, we should plan to meet it in the longer term requires further examination.     T/e may well receive requests for help from friendly governments&apos; (to some of which such as Kenya we arepartially committed) and particularly from Commonwealth countries, thoughincreasingly v/e are likely to find it politically difficult to agree tomeet them (as In Nigeria at present).     Perhaps the most important ofour defence objectives outside Europe or Australia and New Zealand willbe the need to be ready, if the Government of the day so decides, tocontribute to international peace-keeping operations at the request ofthe United Nations or in conjunction with allies.15.   T/e shall, of course, continue to have an interest in the maintenanceof international stability, not only for its own sake, but to avoid dis-ruption of our trade and loss of investments.     Indeed, in the last resortour own national security could he jeopardised by instability in the Near,Middle or Ear East involving military action which led to a widespreadconflict in which we would inevitably find ourselves involved.     Morepositively, we shall wish to influence matters of concern to us and forwardBritish interests through the exercise of political influence as widely aspossible.     The degree to which we are able to support general Westerninterests outside Europe has an effect upon our standing with the UnitedStates and this in turn has implications for our standing with the soviet union.     In the 1970s there may be some shift in balance in our relationswith the United States and Europe hut in any event the more power we have(as well as the stronger our economic position) the more likely it isthat our policies will prevail.     Our military capability therefore,like our economic standing, has to be seen in a broad political contextas well as in relation to specific commitments.   It is not possible to define exactly what obligations we might decide to undertake in thisperiod hut Ministers have made it plain In both the 1966 and 1967Defence White Papers that &quot;Britain will not undertake major operations ofwar except in co-operation with allies&quot;.     Nor will we &quot;accept an obliga-tion to provide another country with military assistance unless it isprepared to provide us with facilities we need to make such assistanceeffective in time&quot;.     V/e do not see ourselves intervening in a majorconflict on our own;   but we shall need to have forces which are capableof making a contribution to international peace-keeping and of dealingwith contingencies which we cannot at present foresee but which allexperience suggests will inevitably occur.
Role of the Forces16.    It is vital to our national^security to prevent war in Europe.   Tothis end we must contribute our share in the collective effort by theWest.    In addition to this strategic requirement there are compellingpolitical reasons for the commitment of British forces to the mainlandof Europe.    In the first place II.T0 is fundamental to our foreign policyand we must work for its continuing vitality and harmony.    Secondly, ifwe succeed in our application to join the e.c. with its consequences inthe political and perhaps in the defence fields, we shall have an additionalpolitical interest in maintaining a contribution broadly comparable with those made by Erance and Germany.   Thirdly, it will be dangerous to European security if Germany is allowed to become the dominantmilitary power in Central Europe and accordingly we must play a part in creating a military framework of an acceptable shape and size into whichthe German contribution can be integrated.   Finally, the prospects of afruitful East-West negotiation will be enhanced by a harmonious Westernalliance containing Germany in an acceptable framework and including theUnited Kingdom in a position of political influence.    The size of forceswe shall require for these purposes will be determined both by strategic considerations and by the necessity for this country to maintain a land,sea and air contribution in keeping with our size and status both as amember of a Western European grouping and as a member of the north atlantic Alliance.    Short of agreement on mutual East/West reductions(not withdrawals) we must assume that cur contribution to NATO must remain on Tsroadly the same scale as now and that we must plan to deploythe same level of forces on the continent in an emergency although theremay be some level of flexibility in their peacetime stations as betweenthe United Kingdom and Germany.17.    Our main roles outside Europe will be -(a) to discharge our responsibilities to our remaining dependenciesand Associated States;(b) to meet our remaining Treaty obligations;(c) to meet our moral obligations to contribute to the defence ofAustralia and New Zealand if they were attacked;(d) to contribute to international peace-keeping;(e) to play a part with our allies in maintaining generalWestern interests.
18,   These will involve stationing only small British forces permanentlyoutside Europe in the mid-1970s.     There will probably be forces to maintain our commitments to Hong Kong and Gibraltar, and there will be some EN andRAP facilities in Malta.     It Is possible that v/e may still require to station small forces in Cyprus.     Yve shall need personnel to maintain ourstaging posts at Ascension and G-an and we may need to develop Aldabra,Por the purpose of the present studies, it has been assumed for costingpurposes that the capability we might maintain in the Par East would takethe form of a small maritime (including amphibious) force stationed InAustralia using Australian facilities, with provision for army and airforces detached from the United Kingdom,     The amphibious force would heable to land two battalions/oommandos within 75 miles of a coastline and to sustain them ashore for periods which would vary according     to the location, nature and circumstances of the operation.     Such a force wouldrequire reinforcement for a number of possible internal security operations,and there would also be the alternative of undertaking these direct fromthe United Kingdom.     Por operations above the level of internal security,appropriate land and air forces would have to he deployed from theUnited Kingdom.     This disposition of forces will moan that we will still have a capability for rapid intervention by air or sea in an internal security contingency   but that,for operations above this level, while weshould be able to provide sea and air forces quickly, operations involvingland forces (of the limited size shown in Annex B) requiring heavy equipment,stores, and substantial quantities of ammunition would take time to mount,being largely dependent upon the time taken for any sea movement, unless some kind of stockpile was available.-7-
III   OUTCOME OF THE DEFENCE EXPENDITURE STUDIES19.   We set out in paragraphs 7-9 the reasons for examining our likelymilitary requirements in all theatres beyond 1970-71.     In short, it isnecessary to consider cur objectives in the mid-1970s if we are to takethe right decisions both on equipment and on the deployment of forces upto 1970-71 and if we are to achieve the savings in defence expenditure inthe years up to 1970-71 for which we are looking.     It does not, however,follow from this that we should seek to settle now in an inflexiblemanner the size and shape of the forces in the mid-1970s,20.   There are particular reasons for needing to be clear about our role in the Par East in the mid-1970s.     It is this theatre which is criticalfor a large part of the savings we aim to achieve, for the plan we need to make about the broad size, shape and equipment of the forces and fortheir organisation and redeployment, and for the reduction in our commit-ments to which the reduction in our military capabilities must be related.Moreover, we need to make our broad intentions clear to our allies notonly for the purpose of securing our immediate objective of orderlyreductions by 1970-71 but also to enable them to adjust their ownpolitical, military and economic policies.     In other theatres, while itis necessary to make assumptions about the timing of our withdrawal for planning purposes, there is more room for manoeuvre and, for reasons which we state later, there are great difficulties in the way of makingfirm and dated proposals at this stage.     Given the relatively smallforces involved In these areas it will be possible, within the scope ofthe plan, to vary the timing of withdrawals within a year or two eitherway.     Moreover, the plan can be adapted to events within considerablybroader limits by making substantially earlier or later withdrawalsubject always to acceptance of the consequential variation of the totallevel of expenditure in particular years.21.   For these reasons we therefore only consider the outcome of the studies in detail, and put them forward as firm proposals, up to theyear 1970-71.     Nevertheless, despite this element of flexibility in the longer term we must set broad policy objectives for the mid-1970sand we must emphasise that the proposals for our military capabilitieshave been related to these objectives, and that the totality of thefinancial savings will be dependent upon them.     There is, however,considerable scope for variation in detail.     For example, for costingspurposes we have assumed that we shall have withdrawn from the-8-
Persian G-ulf &quot;by 1975-76 but will still retain forces in Cyprus beyond thatdate. Events might well dictate an earlier move in the Persian Gulf whichcould well make an earlier change in our position in Cyprus possible.22.   A list of the studies commissioned by Ministers and a note of the pro-gress made on them is at Annex A.   The results of the work of Departments on each of the studies have been subsumed in this report and in particular inSection IV on the size, shape and cost of the forces.    Some of the studieshave been overtaken by subsequent Ministerial decisions and have not therefore been fully examined Interdepartmentally.   Furthermore, departmental work ona number of studies, notably those relating to logistic, training and adminis-trative facilities (see paragraph 46 below) is still continuing or cannot even be started until the decisions on the size, shape and deployment of our forces have been taken.   In the following paragraphs the broad conclusions ofthe studies, as far as they are relevent to this report, are summarised.Europe23.   We Yrere instructed to examine the effect on the number of combat unitsof the Army and Royal Air Force required in the United Kingdom, after thereduction of forces to defence review levels world-wide, if redeployment fromGermany to the United Kingdom had taken place of the order of one divisionalheadquarters and two infantry brigades, including one armoured regiment,supporting arms and services and one heavy air defence regiment, plus one-thirdof the-front line strength of RAF Germany.    It was assumed that the forceswithdrawn from Germany, or their equivalent, would be earmarked for assignmentto NATO,24.   This question cannot be considered in isolation from the other changes inforce levels and deployment resulting from the Defence Expenditure Studiesgenerally, but the study concluded that so long as it was necessary to make available for the defence of Europe forces of the same broad size as we nowplan to have, redeployment of forces from the Continent of Europe to theUnited Kingdom would have only a slight effect on the total size of the forceswe should maintain and therefore on the defence budget as a whole, althoughof course redeployment would have an effect on our foreign exchange costs on defence account.25.   We have stated in paragraph 16 above that Britain&apos;s contribution to thedefence of Europe must be of a size comparable with that of the other mainEuropean countries.   The scale of the collective del once, effort ofthe K,-.T0 Alliance cic:-q---.Cs on   the   threat from the   Soviet Union andthe ,,warsaw Pact   countries,   and it is   difficult to   coo   how   on military grounds any si:.nifant reductions in NATO forces as a whole can
safely be made until, we know there will be parallel reductions in warsaw pact forces-       At present there is no prospect of such mutual   East-Westreductions, although it must remain our aim to bring these about.     Weshall, however, continue to press our allies to accept our views on the duration   of conventional war in Europe and the consequences for the size of the NATO forces required and the stocks we keep;   but since these views met strong resistance from the other NATO countries we have notassumed in the costings that we shall be able fully to implement them.We should also pursue the question of the revision of NATO naval strategy and its effect upon the level of naval forces assigned to NATO.     In short,the conclusion is that we must be prepared to play our part in Europe, both because of the importance to us of the Western Alliance and in relation toour application for entry into the e.c., and also to avoid encouraging furtherwithdrawals of forces from the Alliance, notably by the United States.   in preparing the costings of defence expenditure in 1970-71 and 1975-76 it hasbeen assumed, without any commitment on the part of Departments, that weshall be able to redeploy to the United Kingdom a second brigade and adivisional headquarters from Germany by 31st March 1970; it has already beenagreed, subject to final clearanoe with WEU, that one brigade should beredeployed to the United Kingdom in early 1968,26,   This leaves the particular problem of offsetting the foreign exchange cost of our forces in Germany.   Ministers have asked (0PD(67) 15th Meeting)for a separate examination, in the context of future offset negotiations, ofthe level of forces we should maintain on the Continent of Europe and thequestion of the revision of our commitments to Western European Union.   Aseparate report on this is being prepared for Ministers; but the provisionalconclusion of officials can be summarised as follows.   There would be every advantage in attempting to negotiate an offset agreement Cor a period of upto five years, since this would enable us to exploit the possibilities oflonger-term Anglo-German collaboration in the production and procurement ofmilitary equipment as a source of offset.   It would also avoid the annualstrain of our relations with Germany which offset negotiations have recentlybrought about.   An increase in German military procurement should be our first aim, though civil purchases and offset from the United States (whoseinvolvement in those negotiations is likely to be to our advantage) are also important.   The report will recommend what the timing of our next approachwill be.-10-
Mediterranean and Middle Bast in the mid-1970s27.   Our objective in the longer term is to withdraw from our remainingcommitments&quot;involving stationing forces in the Eastern Mediterranean andthe Middle East,.     The study of our long-term political objectives in thePersi an ^Oulf generally and the circumstances in which, and the process bywhich,our military presence might be brought to an end has shown thegreat difficulty in making reasonable forecasts on which at this stage to base our planning on the timing of these changes.     We still have a majorinterest in the stability of the area, politically, economically andstrategically.     It is not in our interests to depart hurriedly leaving a power vacuum which the other countries in the area will attempt to fill,since this could ?7ell lead to chaos in the area and all the risks to uswhich that entails.     x\ccordingly we should do everything possible toestablish a local balance of power.     We may in the last resort have to contemplate the undesirable course of terminating some of our treaties withthe Sulers unilaterally.     We need not feel obliged to stay in the Gulfuntil we can achieve democratic political institutions,,.   While we may look to withdrawing by the mid-1970s, we must avoid any public statement or leaksabout our acceptance of this limit, since this would upset the presentprecarious stability, put our interests at risk meanwhile and make theprocess of disengagement more difficult, both politically and militarily,as with Aden but on a larger scale,28.   We should aim within this broad time limit to bring forward theBritish Protected States in the Gulf to separate independence, preferablyas four States rather than the present nine, subject to any special arrangements which any of them may wish, or may feel compelled to make withSaudi Arabia.     We should take certain stops to this end at once hut ourtimetable should be flexible if we are not to jeopardise the whole operation.We should he prepared to speed up the process if the course of eventspermits.CENTO and Cyprus in the mid-1970s29.   The other long-term study in this area was an examination of the longer-term value of an prospects for CENTO, and the case for the retentionof the sovereign base areas in Cyprus in the mid-1970s.     CENTO isimportant to us for mainly political reasons, principally relating to Iran,Given that the global nuclear deterrent provides the real core of generalresistance to any Soviet military aggression, the maintenance of themilitary structure to CENTO Is not essential for our own security.     Atpresent we declare to CENTO four Canberra nuclear strike squadrons in cyprus, one Canberra photographic reconnaissance squadron in Malta, and naval forces and one Shackleton squadron in the Persian Gulf.
30.   The reaction of the Shah of Iran has recently been sought to thesuggestion that over the next two years the Canberra force could bescaled down to two squadrons, to be replaced In 1969 by two squadrons of V-bombers in Cyprus or with one squadron in Cyprus and one on call fromthe United Kingdom,     The Shah raised no objections to these proposals,but they have not yet been discussed with either Turkey or the UnitedStates.      In the mid-1970s it should be possible - and this should be our aim - to withdraw our CENTO-declared forces from the Mediterranean,but it is in our interests to maintain our general commitment to Iran,if she wishes it and if it keeps her within the Festern fold; and inthese circumstances CENTO would make a useful contribution to generalwestern objectives in the area..31 .    So long as we declare air forces to CENTO, we shall need to retain the airfield at Akrotiri in Cyprus under British sovereignty as a forward base to the air support of CENTO.     However, even when wo nolonger declare air forces to CENTO we might well have a strong operationalneed for the sovereign base areas as long as we have other roles forwhich we station forces in Cyprus.      Of these other roles, it is,however, unlikely that the Kuwait commitment will still exist in itspresent form in the mid-1970s and we, therefore, foresee no need in thatperiod to provide from Cyprus a conventional strike capability in supportof a plan to assist Kuwait.      Our Treaty commitment to Libya will end in December 1973 and it is unlikely that we shall wish to renew it.We shall, however, require Akrotiri as a staging post, preferably as a sovereign base area, until we have withdrawn both from the Persian Gulfand from the mainland of South East Asia  and no longer need to use theCEMCO route for reinforcement purposes.32,    It might be in our interests to give up one or both of the sovereignbase areas as part of a political settlement in Cyprus even If we stillhad an operational requirement for facilities in the island.     However,in the absence of a Cyprus settlement our freedom to surrender the sovereign base areas is limited both by Treaty and by political considerations;    there is a case for our retaining the areas so thatwe could make a contribution to an eventual settlement, but we cannottell whether a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus problem may beachieved by the mid-1970s.-1 2-
Mediterranean and Middle East up to 1970-7133.   Ministers have already confirmed (OPD(67) 1st Meeting) the defence review decision that a second battalion should be stationed in thePersian Gulf at Sharjah, to meet our commitments in the Gulf after woleave Aden.34.   We were also asked to reappraise the Kuwait commitment in the period up to 1970-71 and the air forces required to he stationed in the persian gulf to carry it out.     Our obligation to respond to a request from Kuwaitfor military assistance against external attack derives from a 1961 Agree-ment which can be terminated at throe years&apos; notice by either side.Since the beginning of this year there has been an understanding withKuwait that our support would consist of air forces only,   unless v/ereceived sufficient warning to bring in land forces from outside thePersian Gulf.     We consider that intervention with land forces can inpractice he ruled out- because of the unlikelihood of our receivingadequate notice from Kuwait.35.   The forces which wo station in the Gulf to meet the Kuwait commitmentat present comprise two Hunter Squadrons (each of tv/elve aircraft):   one ofthese is needed for other purposes as well.     Defence review plansenvisaged that one of these squadrons would be replaced by 10 Phantomaircraft in early 1969* and the other by 12 Harrier (P.1127) aircraft in1970,     It is now proposed that the Harrier deployment should not takeplace, and that instead one of the Hunter squadrons should be retained until1971.     Should the Kuwait commitment continue at its present level after1971, it will he necessary to supplement the 10 Phantom aircraft stationed in the Gulf from the hacking required to meet peacetime wastage.     these forces are the very least which could be contemplated for the initial phase of any Kuwait operation.36. Kuwait1s independence will continue to he an important british interests, both because of our investments in oil in the country and because of Kuwaitfs large sterling balances. We have an interest inaverting any major change in the present state of these balances. Achange of regime in Kuwait leading to domination by, or absorption in another Arab power v/ould carry a considerable risk of adverse effectsupon our balance of payments.-13-
Far East37.   At their meeting on 22nd March (0PD(67) 14th Meeting, Item 2) theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee agreed that it was necessary to planour defence policies in the Far East as far as the mid-1970s If thedefence savings we envisage for 1970-71 were to be realised.   more recently, the Cabinet decided that our main objective must be to obtainthe acquiescence of our allies in our plan to remove our forces from singapore and Malaysia by the mid-1970s, having run these downby about half by 1970-71.   We must also seek to reduce our commitments inthe area in accordance with our intended force reductions.   Ministersrecognised that to achieve this objective it appeared that we should haveto pay a price by indicating a willingness to maintain a military capability for use in the Far East beyond the mid-1970s.   Ministers also decided that we should be prepared to indicate this willingness In the forth-coming discussions with the United States and certain Commonwealth countries;the size, character and deployment of any such capability was left open for the time being.   In order to provide a basis on which to cost the defence programme, the assumption has been taken in Section IV that we shallstation a small amphibious force in Australia using facilities provided bythe Australian Government, and have the capability to detach other unitsof the three Services from the United Kingdom; but this does not prejudge the choice which is open to us to provide the capability using facilities provided by the Government of Singapore or forces normally stationed inthe United Kingdom (which would visit the Far East for periods of training).Our final choice among the three alternatives will depend inter aliaon the attitude of our allies and the relative military and political advantages of the three courses.   It is important that these should receivefurther study before a final decision is taken.   As regards the timing,there is no military need to take a decision for a year or two but politicalpressures may make it desirable to be more specific, particularly, if we decide to state puhjj oly our intention to leave Singapore/Malaysia hyuiemid-1970s.38.   We have made it clear in the first round of consultations with our allies that we intend to reduce our forces in the Far East by about halfby 1970-71, and we have undertaken to consult them again on the detailsof our reductions before taking final decisions in July.   The assumptionused in Section TV is that our present plans, which are still in the courseof being worked out in full, are accepted and implemented: these involvethe withdrawal of virtually all British land forces from Malaysia and singapore by 1970-71, leaving only some Gurkha units and two battalions/commandos and their supporting elements.   The results of this will include the disappearance of the Commonwealth Brigade, and we shallhave to reduce our current force declarations to SEATO, make clear the limitations of our response to the Anglo-Malaysian Defence Treaty, and consider whether the Treaty itself should be revised.
39.   There vri.ll be corresponding reductions in the base facilities, andthe broad effect will be that the bulk of British forces will have leftMalaysia by 1970-7&apos;&apos; , although British military strength in Singapore willbe slightly over half its present level.   The weight of the reductionswill undoubtedly fall on the locally engaged military personnel and thelocally employed civilians, and there will in consequence   be seriouseoonomic effects on both countries, but particularly on Singapore.   V.reconsider the consequences in Section V of this report.Research and Development40.   The object of the study on research and development was to examinethe possibility of making savings of  20 million,  30 million or 50 million at 1964. prices on the provision for defence research anddevelopment expenditure in the 1966 costing.   A Worlcing Group in theMinistry of Defence including representatives of the Ministry of Technologyprepared a study and concluded that a saving of the order of  30 million should be feasible, but that a saving of a higher figure would have an effect on the Research and Development programme out of proportion to theadditional saving.   The Study was necessarily based on defence policy asknown earlier in the year but the changed planning assessments since thendo not significantly affect these conclusions because the changes madeconcern the size and shape of the forces rather than the capabilityrequired of them.4-1.   The detailed application of the cut of around  30 million cannot bedetermined at present, and the Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Technologyreserve their position on particular proposals until further study has been undertaken.   There are implications for industry and for the research and development establishment; while redundancies will release skilledmanpower and could bring longer-term advantages for industry, the questionof how far certain establishments would thereafter remain viable would need study.   The proposed reduction in research and development effortcould also have effects on production expenditure and overseas payments,although these are not of themselves expected to be substantial.-15-
IT.    SIZE, SHAPE: AND COST OF THE FORGES1+2,   The series of policy studies that have been undertaken  (the out coneof which has been summarised in the previous section of the paper) has provided the basis for the new force structures which have been worked out and costed for 1970-71 and 1975-76.     For this purpose it has been necessaryto assume that the policy changes will have been achieved by particular dates,although the costings include scope for the sort of variations described inparagraph 20.     In practice these dates will no doubt vary - they may be alittle earlier or a little later - and it will be possible to vary the defence programme accordingly, but it must be made clear that the fulfilment of theprogramme as a whole and the achievement of the savings forecast in paragraph 52depends on the policy changes being brought into effect in broad conformitywith the assumed timetable so that our military capability can be kept in step with our commitments.     In all cases it has been assumed that our withdrawals,disengagements and redeployments will be carried out on an orderly basis.     Itwill, of course, be necessary to take into account the views of our alliesas the programme proceeds and in particular to work closely with them on the detailed phasing of the reductions and redeployments.     In general we thinkthat the totality of the assumptions used is a reasonable basis on which to plan, subject to the comments made above.     It must, however, be emphasised,that the assumptions made are only a. basis for planning;    they are a guideto shaping the forces and their detailed implementation would be a natter fordiscussion and negotiation over the years.Defence prioritiesA3.   The new force patterns are based on the following assumptions aboutpriorities - (see paragraphs 16 and 17).(a) Priority I - the security of the United Kingdom.(b) Priority II - responsibilities to dependent territories.(c) Priority III - a military capability in support of overseas policy.The randown by geographical areas4k.   The revised force structure has assumed that the necessary adjustments to our commitments (including NATO, YvEU, CENTO, the Persian Gulf, the Anglo-Malaysian Treaty and SEATO) will have been made at approximately the time scales proposed in the studies.     This will require difficult and no doubtlengthy political negotiations with our allies.     Against this background,
and subject to departmental reservations in respect of (a) below, it isproposed that cuts will be made based on the following main features -(a) Two of the six brigade groups now in Germany (excluding Berlin)will be redeployed to the United Kingdom by 1970, and the reductions already planned for the Royal Air Force (i.e. thewithdrawal of a helicopter squadron and the disbandment of5 strike/reconnaissance squadrons) will be completed.     The forcesredeployed to the United Kingdom will be earmarked for assignmentto NATO.     The provision of ships and aircraft for NATO (outsideGermany) has been reduced, and all ships and aircraft have been regarded as available for other uses wherever they may be requiredin the world,(b) In the Mediterranean area in the mid-seventies, we shall retainan airfield at Cyprus for staging purposes and. for support, ifnecessary, of CENTO or NATO.     There will be a small garrison at gibraltar, with port and staging facilities both there and in Maltabut we have made no provision for forces in Libya after 1973o(c) Our forces in the Persian Gulf will have been withdrawn by the mid-seventies and we have taken 1975 as the date for costing purposes.(d) In Malaysia and Singapore we shall seek to reduce our forces byabout half hy 1970-71 and complete the withdrawal by 1975-76.There-after, for costing purposes, it has been assumed that we shall provide a small maritime (including amphibious) presence inAustralia, using Australian facilities, and we shall be able todetach to Australia other forces of the three Services,     Theforces in Australia have been assumed to consist of one commandoship, an assault ship, six destroyers/frigates, one fleet submarine and two battalions/commandos with appropriate artillery andengineer support.     There wall be helicopters but no other residentaircraft.     Whether or not the forces are based in Australia, theywill require support facilities in the United Kingdom.     Asubstantial garrison will be maintained in Hong Kong.There would also be a military capability based on the United Kingdom.-17-

Logistic v Training- and Administrative Facilities46.   In the course of translating these force levels into expenditure forecasts credit has been taken for all foreseeable savings in theorganisation backing the combat forces of the three Services.     Over and above these savings however, further economies should flow from astringent re-examination of the logistic, training and administrativeareas associated with the revised deployment and new force levels.Examination of the ways and means of achieving these economies will take some considerable time to work out tut the aim will be to realise an overallsaving worldwide of the order of 25 per cent on 1966 Defence Review levels;some credit has been taken for these in the costing.     It cannot be stressedtoo strongly that these savings can only flow not only from firm political decisions, at the appropriate time, on the size, shape and deployment ofthe forces but also on a period of stability in planning for some yearsthereafter In order to carry them out.Research and DoyeJLojsmgnt47.   It is assumed in the costing that reductions of the order of 30 million a year will ho achieved on the Research and development programme in 1970-71, in accordance with the conclusions of the study(see paragraphs 40-41).Equipment^ and -qjbher-decisions required48.   Acceptance of the new policy involves taking further decisions on equipment and deployment, details of which are set out in Annex C.Specifically, Ministers are now invited, if they accept these policyproposals -(a) to endorse the requirement for new classes of cruiser, destroyerand frigate, (hut not the numbers of each type), to be introduced in the 1970s, and for the continuance meanwhile of the necessaryrate of frigate and nuclear submarine construction to match thenew force levels;(b) to agree that no further orders should be placed for Phantom and pr.1127 aircraft.Ministers are also asked to note -(c) that a decision is required in July of this year on whether ornot to develop Aldahra as an airfield;    a separate memorandumon this question will be circulated;(d) that the planned requirements for AF7G and Jaguar aircraft willbe reduced on the lines indicated in Annex G, and that theprogramme assumes the purchase in due course of fifteen long-rangestrategic transport aircraft for which C.5 type has been assumed.
Polaris49-   A further question is whether the United Kingdom Polaris force shouldhe deployed east of Suez when (after 1972) we would be in a position to do so.It is not possible to divide a deterrent force of four Polaris submarinesbetween the Atlantic and east of Suez.    Because of the distance from their main base in the United Kingdom, fewer submarines could be on station atimmediate readiness in the Indian Ocean than in the Atlantic, but, at worst,it should be possible to keep one submarine continuously on patrol in theIndo-Pacific area.50.   However, deployment east of Suez would raise difficult political issues.Her Majesty&apos;s Government is deeply committed by the Nassau Agreement, and by its public statements since, to contribute the Polaris force to NATO;    and itis planned to assign the force to NATO as the submarines come into service.The withdrawal of the force entirely from NATO, or the announcement of our intention to do so, might damage the prospect of solving the problem of nuclear sharing in the Alliance (though in certain circumstances might help it).Moreover, our nuclear strategic force could turn out to be a valuable card inrelation to our application to the e.c..   Nor is it clear whether the americans would welcome deployment of our Polaris force east of Suez, or whether the australians or any other country would be willing to allow the force to bebased on their territory.   There would certainly be little prospect of findingany basis in the Indo-Pacific area on which we could say that the Polarisforce had been internationalised.   Finally we could be criticised for appearing to substitute nuclear for conventional capabilities in the area.;    and neitherthe Americans nor our other Allies would be likely to regard the polaris submarines as a satisfactory alternative to those conventional forces which we propose to withdraw from the Par East.51.   The cost of deploying Polaris east of Suez would be about  15 million in capital expenditure, of which  10 million would be in dollars spread overthe period from I968 to 1972.   The costings in paragraph 53 allow forthis.   We do not need to take a decision on deployment east of Suez until october, when it will be necessary to decide whether or not to place ordersworth about  4.5 million for some of the extra facilities and support thatwould be required east of Suez.   We suggest that this decision should be takenthen and not at the same time as the main decisions on defence expenditure.Defence Budget 1970-71 to 1975-7652.     Detailed costings of the defence programme outlined above covering thewhole of the next ten years have been put in hand but will not be ready untilthe beginning of July.   Meanwhile costings have   been   prepared   for thetwo key years 1970-71 and 1975-76.     By chance,   both   of   these   are-20-
years of peak expenditure largely owing to the incidence of productionpayments (e.g. on the HS801 and P1127 in 1970-71 and the Jaguar and AFVGaircraft in 1975-76).    Hence there is no reason to suppose that costs inthe intervening years will present any new problems.   The costings show that apart from transitional expenditure on the defence budget (such asredundancy payments) estimated to be in the region of  15 million in1970-71 and  10 million in 1975-76&quot; and which has been excluded from the targets in the exercise (see OPD(66) 122, Annex, paragraph 7 and paragraph above), savings of about  200 million in 1970-71 and  300 million in1975-76 can be achieved.   The figures, at current prices, are -  million1967-68 1970-71 1975-76Existing Programme 2,400 2,4002,240New Programme 2,200     - 2,100At I964 price levels the cost of the existing programme is  1,940 million this year and  2,100 million in 1970-71 and 1975-76, while the cost of thenew programme is  1,900 million in 1970-71 and  1,800 million in 1975-76.53.   The achievement of these savings, as this paper shows, will entail agreater sacrifice of capability than did the Defence Review itself.   Moreover,it will no doubt be noted that though this sacrifice produces an   appreciablecut in 1975-76 compared with this year&apos;s Defence Estimates (including expenditure under the Armed Forces (Housing Loans) Act) of  1,940 million atI964 prices, the saving in 1970-71, again as compared with the present level,would be relatively small.   The main reasons for this situation, which arefundamental to the problems considered in this report are -(a) As has been made clear publicly, the Defence Review decisions,though they cut the prospective 1969-70 Defence Budget by about 300 million, resulted in a programme still costing over 2,000 million (1964 prices) in 1969-70, and depended on further decisions for the attainment of the  2,000 million target.(b) The current level of defence expenditure reflects a relatively low level of payments for deliveries of expensive items of equipment, particularly aircraft, coupled with a slowing down of expenditure by reason of the uncertainties associated withthe Defence Review.(c) In the Defence Review, and subsequently, several importantequipment decisions were taken which have a very large impact on 1970-71 itself (e.g. on the United States aircraft purchases,the HS801 and the P1127).   The effect of these is that much ofour 1970-71 expenditure is firmly committed.   There is now lessscope for deciding whether new equipment programmes can be eliminated;   It is more a question of cutting existing programmes.-21-

The policy described above would make it feasible, provided thatcommitments were reduced as envisaged above, to cut back progressively theforces planned in last year&apos;s Defence Review, which themselves entailedsubstantial cuts on the force levels of March 1965.     The reduction is showngraphically in Annex D.       The main features as compared with March 1965 are -(a) reductions of about 80,000 In Service manpower, 30,000 Gurkhas andlocally enlisted personnel, 45,000 British civilians, and 55^000overseas civilians over a period of ten years;(b) major cuts in the capability of all three Services including forthe Royal Navy the abandonment of the aircraft carrier and navalfixed-wing aircraft and 20 per cent less ships;    for the Army areduction of about 25 per cent in the number of major combat units;and for the Royal Air Eorce a 35 per cent reduction in the numbersof combat aircraft.-22-(d)   The Defence Review naturally concentrated on savings v/hioh couldbe achieved with the minimum loss of military capability the mainpossibilities of which are therefore nov; exhausted, and it waspossible in some fields (e.g. with the United States aircraft programme) to find ways of achieving broadly the same capabilityat lower cost.The present studies entail finding savings of roughly the same proportions(about one-eighth) as were achieved during the Defence Review,     Given thatthe starting point was a programme already extensively pared, it is not surprising that the new studies show that to achieve the stipulated savingsentail a large reduction in force capability.54.   In terms of foreign exchange, the gross stationing costs (before talcingaccount of e.g. German offset costs and Hong Kong Government payments) of theforces would be reduced as follows -million
TOP SECRET &apos;JM56.   These reductions will involve massive redeployment and reorganisation ofthe forces. Eron the Services&apos; point of view it is necessary to decide and announcenow what should he the size and shape of the forces in 1971 so thatadministrative action can he set in hand, the effect on the morale of theServices reduced as far as possible and an end put to speculation.   Thequestion of what should he said about the shape of the Services in 1975is considered in Section VI of this Report.57.   Reductions of the size set out in paragraph 55 raise many morale and personnel problems in the armed Services which cannot be over-emphasised.They amount to a reduction of 20 per cent of all volunteer regulars, arundown on a greater scale in total than any previous rundown.   Everyeffort must be made to minimise the disturbing effects of the re-organisationand redeployment that will be involved.   Some of the reductions can be accomodated in normal wastage but there will be a large redundancy problem and a large number of units of all three Services will have to be disbanded.It will be important to match the rate of individual discharges as closely as possible to the rate of rundown of units:   to this end, the way must be clear for discharges to start as soon as terms have been announced.Redundancy payments are dealt with in the immediately following paragraphs.In addition, it will be important to make the best possible arrangements for moving men smoothly from the Services into civilian employment where theirabilities and skills can contribute effectively to the productive capacityof the country.   But whatever special arrangements are made, the reductionsnow proposed, coming on top of the decisions of the Defence Review, are bound adversely to affect confidence in the value of a Service career on thepart of those men still remaining in the Services, as well as those thinking of volunteering for such a career.Redundancy Payments58.   The reduction in forces estimated at about 80,000 officers and men(paragraph 55 above) will involve premature termination of careers forsome 19-25,000.   Established practice demands special redundancy payments in addition to such normal pension entitlements as will have accrued,59.   A scheme has been worked out which is geared to payments coveringboth compensation for loss of career and help for resettlement in civilianlife amounting, at the maximum, to the equivalent of twenty-one months&apos;basic pay:   as typical examples, a major aged 39 would get about 3,300;    a sergeant with 16 years&apos; service would get a mixture of cash andenhanced pension to a capitalised value of some  1,800,   The scheme is somewhat less generous, allowing for changes in money values, than theprevious major redundancy scheme of 1957.   Its overall cost, over someeight years, is likely to be of the order of  40 million.   The arrangementsfor redundancy payments are acceptable to representatives of the Servicesand to Ministry of Defence and Treasury Ministers.
V.   AID IMPLICATIONSSingapore60.   The Economic Mission which recently visited Singapore and Malaysia showedclearly that the withdrawal of United Kingdom forces will seriously affectSingapore&apos;s economy, which is already under strain and suffers from risingunemployment.     The base contributes 22 per cent of Singapore&apos;s domesticincome and employs directly about 9 per cent of her labour force;    many othersdepend for some part of their income on the activity generated by the base.61 .   Singapore cannot make the necessary structural changes in her economyunaided, over and above the adjustment consequent on her separation fromMalaysia and the aftermath of Indonesian confrontation.     &quot;Without very substantial aid, the prospect is of economic recession and consequentialpolitical instability.     In such an event, the logical conclusion would bethat a conmiunist regime would emerge, which would have serious effects onour broader political interests (and those of the Vfest) in the area, on our ability to carry out our remaining obligations, on our substantial trade and investment, and specifically on our ability to run down the base in an orderly manner.62.   Ine purpose of our aid should be not only to help to replace the income and employment lost by closing the base but also, primarily through investment and retraining, to contribute to the structural change needed if singapore.pore&apos;economy is ultimately to become viable without continuing major foreignassistance.     If there is further economic decline during the early yearsof the rundown, this objective will be frustrated;   moreover, private investment is much less likely to be forthcoming if the economy is declining.63.   A more detailed pa.per making proposals on the aid which we should offeris being prepared, but our present estimate is that the amount of aid needed,and capable of being used effectively, in the period up to 1970-71 risessteeply from between  1 million and  1.5 million in 1967-68 to between 15 million and  19 million in 1970-71 .     &quot;7e should aim, subject to there being enough opportunities, that about half of this should be used to financeinvestment in the economy;    the rest would have to be used for the supportof Singapore&apos;s balance of payments and local costs,-24-
64.    It is very difficult to assess the amount of aid required from197l-72to the end of the rundown in 1974-75.     Much will depend on the resilienceof Singapore&apos;s economy, her ability to find markets for increased exports,her economic relationships with Malaysia and Indonesia, and the success ofthe investment made during the earlier period in producing additional income and employment.     Nevertheless, much more aid is likely to be required inthis period than in the period up to 1970-71.     On optimistic assumptions,aid would average about  18 million per annum;    on less optimistic assumptions about investment opportunities and achievements, aid might average  22 to 30 million per annum, but could rise, on the worst assumptions, to  33 to, 44 million per annum in 1975-76.     Even on very optimistic assumptionscontinuing aid will be needed at least until 1979.Malaysia65.   The Economic Mission estimated that, allowing for indirect effects, theexpenditure of United Kingdom forces contributes less than 4 per cent of malaysia&apos;s national incomej and (even including Malaysian citizens employedby the Singapore base) cnly 1 per cent of the labour force Is employed by theServices.     The impact of the rundown on Malaysia will therefore be much less than on Singapore.     Nevertheless, economic trends in Malaysia are notfavourable and she is likely to face a difficult balance of payments situation as a result cf the falling prices of her principal exports and her need forIncreased imports.66.   Malaysia will undoubtedly ask for aid because the rundown will marginallyworsen her balance of payments and the employment situation.     It may be politically difficult to offer her much loss favourable treatment proportionatelythan Singapore, particularly in the initial stages, even though conditionsin the two economies are totally different.     On the basis of pastperformances Malaysia could be regarded as an attractive candidate for aid from other countries, but her efforts to obtain this have so far met withlimited success.67.   &apos;s7e consider that an appropriate level of aid in the period 1968-69 to1970-71 would be about  3 to  5 million a year.     A similar amount couldwell be appropriate in the period 1971-72 to 1974-75, despite the continuingrundown, since there should be some additions to income deriving from the investment of the earlier years.     Further aid should not be necessaryafter 1974-75.-25-
68.   The separation of the Malaysian and Singapore economies will increasinglyhinder the development of both countries, but particularly Singapore.   Weshould lose no opportunity of encouraging resistance to this process.Defence Aid to Singapore and Malaysia69.    Singapore will certainly demand defence aid and Malaysia may also do so.How far any defence aid we give will be additional to the requirements ofeconomic aid is difficult to estimate:   defence aid in the form of payments to personnel or the development of military manufacturing facilities couldbe in substitution for economic aid, but defence aid in the form of military equipment would in itself make no direct contribution to Singaporelseconomy, and would need to be additional.     We should be cautious about whatequipment we should offer, and bear in mind the dangers of a possible armsrace between Singapore and Malaysia.70.   No account has been taken of the facilities we shall release, some ofwhich, particularly the Singapore dockyard, are of economic value.   Theterms on which these are made available to the Governments of singapore and Malaysia will be a matter for negotiation.Pother Countries71.   To meet the effects of the disbandment of the Gurkhas by the mid-1970s,there are full resettlement terms already available but the NepaleseGovernment might well claim some additional aid for resettlement schemes.72.   In Cyprus, a total (as distinct from the present partial) rundown ofour forces would almost certainly lead to an expectation of aid.     Bythe terms of the Independence Treaties,we have in fact an obligation to consult with the Cyprus Government on the levels of aid irrespective of such a rundown.     The Cyprus Government might well invoke this provision and we shall have an obligation at least to consider any request whichmight be made;   but much will depend on the circumstances in which the bases are being given up.
73.   Finally, in order to counter any belief that we are losing interestin the area, we nay well have to consider increasing our present modestexpenditure of aid, information work and British Council activities in theother countries of the area (including our Pacific dependencies);    the oversea Departments will urge that we should do so and that additional funds should he made available for the purpose.     Increased expenditure,in addition to demons &quot;orating continued British interest, would assist in building up the strength of the countries of the region.Adrdnistration of Mitigating Aid74.   It has been agreed that assistance for Malaysia and Singapore shouldhe additional to the aid coiling as at present defined.     The question of whether this should apply to additional aid for Cyprus or elsewhereconsequence of dof0.000 reductions would to a matter for discussion atthe time.     Vie should emphasise to the Governments of Malaysia and singapore that our aid should be linked to their effective co-operation in its administration and also in the rundown of our forces.General75.   The amount of aid depends on the outcome of negotiations, and thefigares suggested in the preceding paragraphs are necessarily speculative.They take account, so far as possible, of the likely availability of resources within the countries concerned and from third sources.     Weshould do what we can to encourage assistance from third sources, hutinevitably the bulk must cone from us.     The aid we are likely to haveto give to Singapore and Malaysia, will rise steeply from between 2 million and  3 million in 1 967-68 to between  20 million and  25 million in 1970-71.     From 19/1-72 to 1974-75 the annual average of aid could lie between  21 million and  35 million,,     Thereafter there is likely to be a continuing commitment to Singapore at least until 1979-80.     These figures are, however, small compared with the savings we expect to achieve on defence account of some  300 million per annum in 1975-76, a large part ofwhich relates to the Far East.     Furthermore, some part of our aid relates to what would in any case be necessary to mitigate the effects of therundown to 1969-70 decided in the 1966 Defence Review.     If our aid is insufficient for its purpose, we shall not achieve our objective of an orderly rundown and shall he faced with the prospect of chaos in the area.
VI.   PRESENTATION76.   The presentation of the proposed reductions raises a nuriber ofdifficult issues where in certain respects the arguments are conflicting.However, it is cloar that it will he necessary to announce in some detail the reductions which we intend to achieve by 1970-71f and. we see noinsuperable political or military difficulty in doing so , but it willbe necessary, inter alia, to reduce our commitments, notably to SEATO.It will also be necessary, in order to plan the future size, shape andequipment of the forces and achieve the savings which are needed, to takeand announce now some decisions about certain specific types of equipment for the forces (ships and aircraft), though not about the numbers whichwill then be required.   We also take the view that it is desirable on a balance of considerations that we should announce now that those reductionstogether with further reductions which we plan to make thereafter would pro-duce further savings of the order of  100 million a year by the mid-1970s.The announcement should add that this would entail some further reductions inour commitments but we do not think that it would be sensible to determinethese In detail so far ahead, since the timing and manner of achieving themmust be adapted to events.   It is also necessary totake, though not to announce, broad planning decisions about the size of the forces in the mid-197077.   As regards the longer term in the Middle East, there are no planningdecisions needed now which call for any public announcement of our intentions:   our plans in respect of the forces we propose to maintainthere are marginal to the broad decisions of principle and savings whichare in mind and we have had no discussions with any of our allies about these intentions which would increase the risk of leakage of information.We a.re agreed that the arguments against making any announcement in thenear future of our ionger-term intentions In this area are compelling,particularly in view of the increased instability of the Middle East as aresult of the present hostilities.   To do otherwise would put seriouslyat risk the existing regimes in the Persian Gulf, and endanger the stability of these areas as a whole, with serious consequences for ourwider interests and those of the West.   Specifically, we should be puttingat risk our commercial interests, increasing the military risks while we remained, and jeopardising the achievement of the required financial savings.-28-
78.   It is in respect of tho Far East that the real dilemma arises on whether or not to announce now our longer-term political plans in respectof the mid-1970&apos;s, and precise planning dates for the reductions of commitments and withdrawals of forces.   The arguments are conflicting.On the one hand, it can be argued that the announcement of the broadshape of the forces which are planned for 1975-76, and perhaps in lesser degree announcements about future types cf defence equipment and financial targets, will permit intelligent deductions of our intentions in respect of commitments and withdrawals to be made with some precision.Furthermore, the discussions which have already taken place with our allies about our future Intentions, together ;vith a continuance of internalplanning on the basis proposed, involves a substantial risk of a leakage of our plans.   Additionally there will undoubtedly be considerable political pressure in the United Kingdom for a statement to be made of those plans.These are all arguments for a clear statement of our political and militaryplans for this area for the mid-1 970&apos;s.79.   Despite these considerations we have come to the view that the balanceof argument is against doing so.   While the risk cf a leakage of information and of intelligent deduction certainly exists, its effect on the political position overseas and on cur interests would not in our view be nearly as serious as a statement by the Government of what our precise plans are.   Experience in other fields e.g. the deployment of nuclear weaponshas shown that even in somewhat comparable circumstances it is possibleto maintain, and to gain substantial advantage from, a position of officialgovernmental silence on important aspects of defence policy.   In thesecircumstances, the positive arguments against an announcement of our intentions for the mid-1970&apos;s are very strong.   The initial consultations with our allies have shown them to be unanimously opposed to any public declaration of our proposal to withdraw wholly from Malaysia and Singaporeby the mid-1970s and any such announcement would seriously increase thedifficulties of obtaining their acceptance of the detailed reductionsup to 1970-71: and therefore put at risk the achievement of the fullsavings involved.   The effect of an announcement on stability, and on ourccmmercial interests, would be no less dangerous than in the persian gulf and would have even wider repercussions.    The Prime Minister of singapore has argued   cogently that an announcement would jeopardise economicand political stability in Singapore   and the Deputy Prime Minister of malaysia   has written in similar terms.    We have considered whether thereis a countervailing argument for making an announcement on the ground
that this would give greater certainty of achieving the financial savings on which we plan.   Provided, however, that we make our intentions clear in confidence to our allies, we do not consider this argument to he of much substance.   The internal acceptable of planning dates and the communication of them to our allies should do all that is possible toensure their achievement, while the announcement would in other respects,for the reasons we have advanced, actually endanger the achievement ofthe savings:   we shall be less free to adapt our policy to events themore we have publicly committed ourselves in advance to dates as far aheadas eight or nine years.   Por this reason, and for presentational purposes,it will be essential to take a flexible attitude towards the timing of ourplanning assumptions, not least so that we may be ready to take advantageof changes in the international situation.80.   We therefore conclude, the Treasury reserving their position, thatthe balance of argument is in favour of making no public declaration of our intention to withdraw from the mainland of Asia by the mid-1970s.   Werecommend that we should say that, as is evident from the 1966 defence white Paper (Cmnd. 2901) we have, throughout the Defence Review and subsequent studies, looked to a time when our forces will no longer remainin Malaysia and Singapore.   It would be unwise to seek to fix a precisedate for a stage that lies some way ahead, but we think it right to statethat,when that time comes, we are prepared to continue to maintain amilitary capability for use in the Far East.   One possibility would be to base this force on Australia, if that course were to commend itself toour allies at the time.   Further study of this and other possibilities isrequired, and discussions continue with the Government of Australia on thepractical possibilities of our having military facilities in that country if necessary.   The time is not, however, ripe for final decisions to betaken on the size, shape and deployment of this force.
SUMMARYI.    INTRODUCTION(l)   We v/ere originally instructed by Ministers to study how to securefurther large reductions of the order of  200- 300 million a year in the planned Defence Budget by 1970-71, without a fundamental change in our external policies.     Since then the political and economic pressures for defence reductions have increased.    (Paragraphs 1-3).(2)   We made an interim report that savings of only some  100- 125 million could be achieved within the assumptions which were set and ministers decided that we should look for greater savings, particularly in the far East, on the basis that we should withdraw wholly from Singapore and malaysia by 1975-76.     (Paragraphs 4-6).(3)   We have thought it right to go somewhat beyond the task set by ministers and have reviewed our likely commitments and military requirements in all oversea theatres, and their consequences for theforces, up to the mid-1970s.    (Paragraphs 7-U).11*    OUR ROLE IN THE MID-1970S(4)   By the second half of the 1970s we shall largely have completed a process of transition since the end of the world war from a country with large oversea possessions, commitments and forces literally round theworld, to one of disengagement from formal major commitments andmilitary positions outside Europe.     By then our particular obligationswill have stabilised and will relate to Australia and New Zealand and small scattered Colonial dependencies or comparable commitments.(Paragraphs 12-14).(5)   We shall, however, continue to have an interest in contribiting to themaintenance of international stability, though we shall not undertakemajor operations of war except in co-operation with our allies, and weshall need forces capable of making a contribution to international peace-keeping.    (Paragraph 15).(6)   It is vital to our national security to prevent war in Europe:our principal commitment will be to NATO and we shall only have small british forces permanently stationed outside Europe,    (paragraphs 16-18).
TOP SECRETIII.   OUTCOME OF THE DEFENCE EXPEI\[DITURE STUDIES(7)   We consider, in broad outline only, our objectives up to the mid-1970s to the extent that this is necessary for shaping our broadpolitical aims and planning the broad size, shape and equipment of theforces, but we make it clear that we think it would be mistaken policy to commit ourselves to a detailed and inflexible timetable beyond1970-71.   (Paragraphs 19-22).Europe(8)   The scope for reduction of our forces stationed on the mainland ofEurope is likely to be confined to the redeployment of one further brigade and a divisional headquarters to the United Kingdom.   A separate report isbeing submitted about the problem of offset payments.    (Paragraphs 23-26).Mediterranean and Middle East in mid-1970s(9)   We expect to have withdrawn from the Persian Gulf by about the mid-1970s and by this stage we hope that we could also withdraw ourCENTO declared forces from the Mediterranean while maintaining our generalcommitment to assist Iran.     (Paragraphs 27-30).(10) If we achieve these withdrawals our need in Cyprus will be primarily for a staging post, but the date at which we can give up the sovereignbase areas will depend on the prospect of a political settlement of the cyprus problem, the date of which we think it vain to prophesy.   Wetherefore plan on the basis that small forces may have to be retained in cyprus even in the mid-1970s.    (Paragraphs 31-32).Mediterranean and Middle East:   Up to 1970-71(ll)   We consider that we should maintain the Kuwait commitment and can do so with small RAF forces;   a second battalion will, in accordance withthe existing Ministerial decision, be stationed in the Persian Gulf atSharjah.   (Paragraphs 33-36).Far East(12)   We plan to reduoe our forces In the Far East by about half byI97O-7I and to withdraw them wholly from the mainland of Asia (save from hong Kong) by 1975-76.   We have assumed for working purposes that themilitary capability which Ministers have decided we should be prepared tomaintain for use in the Far East after 1975-76 will include basing a smallmaritime (including amphibious) force   on Australian facilities;   but this does not prejudge other possibilities and no final decision need be taken for the time being.   (Paragraphs 37-39).
Research and Development(13)   We consider that a cut of about  30 million can be made in expenditure on research and development.   This may have repercussions onthe viability of some Government R and D   establishments, (Paragraphs 40-4-1).IV.    SIZE, SHAPE AND COST OF THE FORCES(14)   The revised force structure has assumed that the necessary adjustments to our commitments (including NATO, WEU, CENTO, the persian gulf, the Anglo-Malaysian Treaty and SEATO) will have been made at approximately the time scales envisaged in the studios.   The table inparagraph 45 which sets out these forces in detail also shows that no provision is made for the replacements of losses in action of ships and aircraft, nor for the replacement of casualties in excess of 5*000 men.(Paragraphs 42-45).(15)   Wo have assumed a substantial overall saving world-wide inlogistic, training and administrative costs.    (Paragraph 46).(l6)   We draw attention to the decisions that will bo required in respectof new classes of ships, the size of the army, planned aircraft orders and whether or not Aldabra should be developed as an airfield.(Paragraph 48).(17)   We recommend that we should not decide until October whether or notto place orders for the extra facilities required, if we wish to leploythe Polaris force East of Suez.   (Paragraph 49-51).(l8)   We set out on the basis of the studies the savings that will beachieved in the Defence Budget of the order of , 200 million py 1970-71 and 300 million by 1975-76.   Instead of increasing from the current year&apos;slevel of  1,940 million (at 1964 prices) to  2,100 million in 1970-71, &quot;theDefence Budget will fall to  1,900 million in that year and to  1,800 million by 1975-76.   At this year&apos;s prices the fall would be from  C2,240 million this year to  2,200 million in 1970-71 and  2,100 million by 1975-76.   the achievement of these savings will entail a greater sacrifice of military capability than did the Defence Review itself,   (paragraphs 52-53).(19)   We then show the reduction that will be achieved in defence overseaexpenditure (gross) from an estimated  252 million in 1967-68 to 191 million in 1970-71 and  130 million in 1975-76.    (Paragraph 54).-33-
(20) These reductions will, as compared with March 1965,  comprise areduction of about 80,000 in Service manpower^     30,000 Gurkhas andlocally enlisted personnel, 45,000 British civilians and 55,000 overseascivilians over a period of ten years;   20 per cent less ships for theRoyal Navy following the abandonment of the aircraft carrier and navalfixed-wing aircraft, a reduction of 25 per cent for the Army in majorcombat units and a reduction of 35 per cent in RAF combat aircraft.If the full economies from these reductions are to be achieved they willrequire a substantial period of stability in planning thereafter.(Paragraphs 55-56).(2l) These reductions create serious morale and personnel problems whichit will be important to mitigate as far as possible.     The careers forbetween 19,000-25,000 officers and men will be curtailed and redundancy payments over eight years will be of the order of  40 million.(Paragraphs 57-59).V.     AID IMPLICATIONSSingapore(22) The Singapore economy is already under stress and unemployment isrising.     United Kingdom forces are responsible directly or indirectlyfor some 22 per cent of domestic income and their -withdrawal will notonly require major structural changes in the economy, but risk suchpolitical instability that a communist regime might take over.     Thiswould have serious consequences for our own interests and for thoseof the West in the whole, and specifically for our directeconomic interests and orderly withdrawal from the base.(Paragraphs 60-6l).(23) The level of aid in the early years of the run down will be crucialif we are to avoid Singapore becoming a permanent pensioner.     WhileDepartments are not committed yet to figures, our estimate is that the aid required up to 1970-71 will rise from  l- lg- million in 1967-68 to 15- 19 million in 1970-71.     (Paragraphs 62-63).(24) The aid requirements between this period and 1974-75 are moredifficult to assess, but on optimistic assumptions they average about 18 million a year:    on the worst assumptions they could rise to 33- 44 million in 1975-76.     Aid will be required at least until theend of the decade.      (Paragraph 64)*
Malaysia(25) The impact of the run down on Malaysia will be much more limited,since our forces expenditure there contributes less than 4- per cent of the national income.   Nevertheless, it will further damage Malaysia1seconomy which is losing its early buoyancy,    (Paragraphs 65-66).(26) We consider that an appropriate level of aid up to 1970-71 wouldbe between  3-5 million a year,    (Paragraph 67).(27) We envisage a similar average thereafter up to 1974-75 after whichwe do not think that further aid will be required specifically becauseof the withdrawal of our forces,   (Paragraph 67).(28) The separation of the Malaysian and Singapore economies is likelyto damge both countries, but particularly Singapore. Y/e should lose no opportunity to encourage resistance to this process.    (Paragraph 68),Defence Aid(29) We may also have to provide defence aid.   To the extent that thiscovers local forces costs it will be subsumed in the general aid proposed above, but it might prove necessary to provide additional aid for military equipment.    (Paragraph 69).Other countries(30) There may be further calls for aid specifically in respect of Nepaland Cyprus and perhaps more generally to demonstrate continued british interests in the area.    (Paragraph 71-73).Administration of Aid(31)    It is agreed that the aid for Singapore and Malaysia should be additional to the aid ceiling as at present defined,   it should be linked to effective co-operation in its administration and also in the run-down of our forces.    (Paragraph 7k).Summary of aid implications(32) The broad picture of aid requirements for Singapore and Malaysiaconsequent on our run down is -1967-68 to 1970-71 from  11-15 million per annum1971-72 to 1974-75 from  21-35 million per annum.There is likely to be a continuing requirement for aid to Singapore untilthe end of the decade.   Large though they are, these figures are stillsmall in relation to the defence savings which we expOct to achieve by&quot;the run down.    (Paragraph 75) *
3 3 i&apos;VI.   PRESENTATION(33) We propose that plans should be announced in detail in respect ofour political objectives and changes in the size^ disposition and cost of the forces up to 1970-71.   (Paragraph 76).(34) We recommend the maintenance of secrecy about our longer-term aims in the Middle East.    (Paragraph 77).(35) Vie take the view, the Treasury reserving their position, that thebalance of argument is against announcing our plans for the mid-1970&apos;s inthe Far East, provided we make these clear in confidence to our alliesand take the necessary equipment and planning decisions in respect of theforces.   V/e propose the broad content of the announcement which should in consequence be made.   This would include an indication of the further savings we plan to make by the mid-1970s.

ANNEX BFORCE COMMITMENTS AND CAPABILITIESoy^J-military^Q^jj-nations. ^ cominitaents and for ce declarations.A.   NATOFor^ge. oonmiitmenbs1.     We remain a member nation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.In addition to the general obligations which derive from the North atlantic treaty, certain specific elements will continue to apply;    the brussels treaty will commit us to station forces on the continent of Europe andbhe Nassau Agreement to contribute strategic nuclear forces.     The military capability of our land forces in Germany would be seriously prejudiced ifthere is insufficient warning for the deployment of the NATO earmarked division,for the call out of reserves, for reinforcement to he effected and forthe men and equipment to be deployed to battle positions before any aggressionoccurs.Force levels2.     In most cases, the United Kingdom&apos;s firm NATO force commitments coveronly the Immediate calendar year, being renewed or revised annually.     Theydo not therefore provide a satisfactory basis for judging longer-term plans.However, last year, NATO Ministers adopted for planning purposes a minimumNATO force plan up to 1970.     This is used in what follows as the basis forassessing the NaTO consequences of the force levels now proposed for 1971 and3.     On this basis, there are no changes in our ground force contribution,other than the redeployment to the United Kingdom of one division, but thereare reductions by 1971 in our naval and air contributions.4.     Ground force contributions to NATO will remain unchanged, except that one division will, in normal times, he redeployed in the United Kingdom.     Thismeans that it has been assumed that by 1970 a second brigade and aDivisional Headquarters will be redeployed from Germany to the United Kingdom.1976.The A(5)
The contribution consists of:(a) 3 divisions, each of two brigades, with appropriate support;in March 1971 and March 1976, one of the three divisionswill be in the United Kingdom.(b) 1 battalion group, and supporting elements, as the UnitedKingdom element of the ACE Mobile Force.(c) The Strategic Reserve Division (3 Division), if available.Reinforcements totalling some 63,000 are necessary to place the three &quot;NATO&quot; divisions on a war footing, of whom 60,000would be members of the Reserve Forces.The Royal Navy5.     The position is set out in Table 1 below.     The forces immediately available are classed as &quot;Category A&apos;  declarations, and there is little difference between the current NATO assumptions for the end of 1970 andthe new assumptions for the end of the financial year 1970-71.     But the&apos;Category B and C declarations, which are for forces becoming availablelater, and the maritime patrol aircraft, are considerably reduced.     Between1971 and 1976, however, the general level of the naval force declarationsremains approximately the same.     All ships and maritime aircraft are regard as being available for world-wide use as necessary.Table 1fi2Z2i Navy Force Levels.6.CategoryAttach/Light Air-craft CarrierASYI AircraftCarrierCruiserDestroyer/FrigatePolarissubmarinesSubmarinesMCM vesselsNATOfor, endJJTOA      B/CDsfbnce studiesMarch 1971A11. -1343152331250V 1171113431920B/C1223411115Defence StudiesMarch 1976A      B/C2393212021291107Note: The naval force declarations for 1971 and 1976 assume that theships concerned have not been committed for operations outsidethe NATO area.(6)
Royal Air Force.7.     The principal changes from earlier plans stem from recent reductions inthe &quot;V-Bomber, Shackleton and Phantom forces that we had hitherto envisagedas available to NATO.

War reserves will continue to be provided, on the basis of the presentNATO approved strategy, for 30 days operations by land and air forces andfor 90 days by naval forces.National Commitments9. In addition to our NATO obligations, we have several national commitments in Germany,     We are obliged to maintain a garrison in Berlin, and to play
our part in the contingency plans which arise from the situation of theAllied garrisons there.     We also have a commitment for the surveillanceand control of a sector of the East/West German border with land and airforces.     We shall discharge these obligations by the use of NATO-earmarkedforces based in West Germany or forces from the United Kingdom as appropriate, and by maintaining in Berlin a garrison of one brigade andPAE elements as at present (this garrison is not included in our NATOcontribution).B.   MediterraneanForce Coimaitments1.     In 1970-71 we have assumed that we shall still be committed to thedefence of Gibraltar , Malta and the SBAs in Cyprus and we shall still havetreaty obligations to Libya.     By 1975-76, our treaty commitment to Libyawill have ended;   we shall probably still have defence obligations to Malta,although the current Defence Agreement ends in 1974;    c-nd we shall remain responsible for Gibraltar and the SBAs in Cyprus.Eorce Levels.2.     In 1970-71, British forces stationed in the Mediterranean will consista small Army garrison in Gibraltar;    a small Air Force and Army garrison in Malta together with limited Naval facilities;    a small Army garrison andan Air Eorce staging post in Libya;    and an Army garrison and an Air Forcestrike, air defence and transport aircraft in Cyprus.       By 1975-76, therewill still be a garrison at Gibraltar;    the Army will have left Malta butthe Air Force will retain its staging post there and, depending on decisions on CENTO force declarations, a reconnaissance squadron;   we shall have noforces in Libya;    and in Cyprus the size of our forces will be determinedby how it is decided to meet our CENTO commitment in the mid-1970s.Table 3 sets out the position.(3)

Army and Air Forcedeployments in Cyprus in 1975-76depend on decisions on CENTOforce declarations at that time.C.     CentoForce Commitments1.     We shall remain a member of the Organisation throughout the period, butthroughout the period the military forces committed to the alliance will be progressively reduced.Force Levels2.     In 1970-71, we shall declare the following forces to CENTO:    two strikesquadrons (either both in Cyprus or one in Cyprus and one in the UnitedKingdom);    one reconnaissance squadron in Malta;    and one Long RangeMaritime Patrol Squadron and naval forces in the Persian Gulf.     By1975-76, we assume that British forces will have been withdrawn from thePersian Gulf including those declared to CENTO.     It is also possible that by then we shall have obtained the concurrence of our CENTO allies towithdraw our CENTO-declared forces from the Mediterranean to the United
Kingdom;    in this case, our only requirement for Cyprus would be as a forward operating base (so long as we continue to declare air forces toCENTO) and as a staging post.     However, if it is decided to continue to station air forces declared to CENTO in the Mediterranean, it will benecessary also to retain the Army garrison and air defence forces in Cyprus,Persian GulfForce Commitments1.     In 1970-71 we shall still have defence obligations to Kuwait and theBritish Protected States in the Lower Gulf (including Bahrain, Qatar,Sharjah, Abu Dhabi and Dubai);    and Muscat will still look to us forassistance.   By 1975-76 we shall have disengaged ourselves from these commitments.Force Levels2.     In 1970-71 we shall have a Naval force of 3 frigates and 6 minesweepers,2 Infantry battalions with armoured, artillery and engineer support and airforces consisting of 2 close support squadrons, tactical transport and long range maritime patrol aircraft.     By 1975-76 all our forces will havebeen withdrawn but we have assumed that this withdrawal will not take plaoountil very near the end of the period.E.     AfricaForce Commitments1 .     w&quot;e shall have no formal defence commitments in Africa but may wish to beable to play a part either in a peace-keeping role Amost probably in company with others or as part of a United Nations force) and have some responsibilitiefor the protection of British subjects.Force Levels2.     Nil.E.     Caribbean1. One destroyer/frigate will be permanently deployed in the Caribbean area.The garrison in British Honduras will have been withdrawn by the mid-1970s.G, The Far EastForce CommitmentsI.A To shall aim to reduce our forces in Malaysia and Singapore by about a half by March 1971? and to adjust our present commitments to the Anglo-Malaysian Defence Treaty, SEATO, the Commonwealth Brigade and the CommonwealthStrategic Reserve.     At this date our forces in the area will bepredominantly naval and air forces.     life shall have withdrawn our forces from Malaysia and Singapore by 1975-76*
2.     A garrison will &quot;be maintained in Hong Kong throughout the period andafter 1970-71 there will also be three minesweepers.     By 1975-76 the requirement to der.1onstr0.te a measure of control over the air space willhave to be net by periodic visits of aircraft from elsewhere.3.     We assume we shall have no commitments to an independent Brunei.A.     It has already been decided that we shall retain a continuingcapability for use in the Far East in the mid-seventies, and for the purposeof the present studies it has been assumed that we shall retain a presence in the form of maritime (including amphibious and rotational air) forces which will, subject to agreement with Australia, use Australian facilitiesafter the withdrawal from Singapore.       Ho Army or Air Force units wouldbe permanently stationed in the area;   we would probably wish to useAustralian facilities for training Amy units flown out from the UnitedKingdom, and we would demonstrate our reinforcement capability by rotatingdifferent types of 3AF squadrons from the United Kingdom at suitable intervalAny re ed to honour our remaining responsibilities to dependent territories would be undertaken by the amphibious force, or by forces based on theUnited Kingdom, which bring their own supplies with them.     By 1975-76,subject to the outcome of studies now in progress, there would be no significant reserves in the area, apart from limited stocks of conventionalbombs and ammunition, possibly in Australia.Force Levels5.The assumed force levels are set out below in Table ifTable 4FORCE LEVELS IK THE FAR EASTMarch 1971March 1976Royal NavyCommando Ships (LPH)Assault Ships (LPD)CruisersGuided Missile Destroyers/Destroyers/FrigatesFleet SubmarinesPatrol SubmarinesMCM Vessels/Patrol Craft812611136111Naval Support ShipsRoyal Fleet Auxiliaries211(in Hong Kong)210Amphibious ForceInfantry Battalions/RM CommandosCommando Light Regiment RAIndependent Field Squadron RE*211211i.e. one third of a major unit.

SLATOForce ConnitmentI. Force declarations to SEATO at present consist of substantial elements of all three Services.   We assume that we shall progressively reduce both our obligations and our force declarations.   No forces or facilities wouldbe specifically provided in the Far East for SEATO operations, and ourresident contributions to the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve at best would be materially reduced and the Commonwealth Brigade would disappear.   Part of thecurrent land force declaration, the Amphibious Force, could be made availablethroughout the period, and could continue to be available from Australiaafter 1975-76.   If land forces from the United Kingdom were required, Itcould take up to three months to complete the build-up.Force Levels2,     Table 5 below sets out the position on assumed force levels;   thegeneral position is, as described above for the lend force declaration,that by 1975-76, for the purposes of this Study, we assume that availableforces in the Far East will be centred upon the Amphibious Forces and thatany reinforcement would need to be despatched and maintained from theUnited Kingdom,

(34)J.      General Military Capability in 1975-761.     We have assumed that operations short of general war, outside europe, might take any of these forms -(a)   Operations at a level below that of general war in conjunctionwith an ally or on request by the United Nations;(h)   internal security in a dependent territory, or aid to a commonwealth country or associate state, or other friendlycountry appealing for assistance;(c) the protection and evacuation of British nationals;(d) miscellaneous operations of a minor nature, such as disasterrelief,2,     By 1975-76 the reduced levels of our forces and the absence of overseas bases will limit our capacity to maintain a continuous presence asa deterrent in any areas away from the United Kingdom and Western europe and our ability to provide fully balanced and supported forces capable of intensive and prolonged operations.    The reductions in overseas stockpileswill affect the timescale in which we can respond.5.     Naval Operations World Wide(a)   Naval forces would be able to provide a thinly spread capabilityin whatever theatre a presence is needed.    Lightly armed shipssuch as frigates would provide this and assist in keeping thepeace.    Ships of higher capability including destroyers andfleet submarines would provide credibility to this presence.(h)   Depending on its deployment the amphlbioas force, with adequateafloat support, could provide a capability to land up to twohattalions/oomnandos      anywhere within 75 miles of the coast and to sustain them ashore for periods which would vary according to the location, nature and circumstances of theoperation.   Eor operations above the level of Internal Security,reinforcements including army units v/ould he required.    Inparticular, air defence, offensive air support, seaborne and/orland based, and maritime reconnaissance would have to beprovided as appropriate.    Reinforcements would also be requiredin many types of Internal Security Operations.(c)   Eor operations requiring a capability higher than that deployedpermanently in a theatre, e.g, for the equivalent of a brigade group Type Operation, a total naval force could be deployedconsisting of a cruiser as command ship, ten destroyers and
: frigates and five submarines; the Amphibious Force could alsocontribute.    Reliefs for these ships would be provided fromthose undertaking other tasks West of Suez, but for operations of short duration the need to provide reliefs for ships wouldnot exist and larger numbers of ships could therefore be deployed.(d)   The force mentioned above would be additional to maintainingon task one frigate (two on station) for each of two internal security Operations lasting a full eighteen months.Land Forces4.     In any two-year period, the land forces based in the United kingdom would be able concurrently -(a) To deploy a balanced force, centred round a brigade groupwith appropriate support and logistic backing, and capableof operations, above the level of Internal Security, lastingnet more than a year.    (Relief or reinforcement would be from our NATO-earmarked forces, subject to the agreement of SACEUR.)(b) To deploy lightly-equipped forces, up to the equivalent of a brigade, capable of Internal Security Operations for abouteighteen months.(c) To use a parachute force of up to two battalions in operationswhere points of entry had to be secured.The use of the brigade-strength forces would mean that our ability to reinforce our NATO-earmarked forces with 3 Division would lapse.    Navaland air support for the operations would be required.    In 1970-71 therewould be about 45 major army units in the United Kingdom and 37 inl?75-76, in   addition to NATO-earnarkod forces also stationed in the UnitedKingdom.Air Operations World-wide5.(a)   Virtually tho whole of the RAF United Kingdom-based   front line could be made available for major operations world-wide, including counter-air,reconnaissance, direct or indirect support of land forces and protection of shipping in the theatre of operations.    Themaximum contribution, from within which provision for therelief of committed units would have to T*e found, could befive squadrons of all-weather fighters; supported by surface-(15)
to-air missiles: 9 squadrons for long-range strike and reconnaissance: 2 squadrons for long-range maritimereconnaissance: 3 squadrons for close support and reconn-aissance: helicopters, giving a two-company lift of air-transportable helicopters and 1 squadron of heavy crane lifthelicopters: and AEW and tanker aircraft.(b) For concurrent Internal Security or counter-insurgencyoperations, one additional squadron   of close support aircraft,one squadron of short-range fixed-wing tactical transport-aircraft and additional helicopters could be made available.(c) On the assumption that a snail number of C5 aircraft will havebeen introduced into service by 1975-76, the capacity of theair transport force will have increased considerably; theextent to which this improved capability will offset the lossof theatre reserves and stockpiles is under study at present.Losses on Operations6.     No specific provision has been made to replace losses in action ofships and aircraft nor for the replacement of casualities in excess of5,000 men.
ANNEX CEQUIPMENT AND OTHER DECISIONS required a.     Naval Re-equipment programme the broad shape of the Fleet is unchanged fron the 1966 Defence Review,but, as Annex B shov/s, its size has been reduced.     What has to be settledis the replacement   programme for ships which will be at the end of theiruseful lives in the 1970s, and the deployment, in these new ships, of weapons and equipments whose development is now under way.2.     The force levels assumed up to 1970-71 call for little in the way of fresh equipment decisions.     The rolling programme of frigates and nuclearsubmarines needs to be continued:    for this, approval is required to orderfurther LEANDERS and to implement the necessary rate of submarineconstruction.3.     After 1970-71, we shall need to start a replacement programme centringon three main classes of surface ships:(a)    Cruiser:    to carry the command afloat and the larger helicopterswhich are an essential part of our anti-submarine warfareequipment, after the aircraft carriers and converted Tiger Classcruisers phase out.     This merely confirms last year&apos;s white paper announcement:    however, it is now proposed to meet the requirement more economically by developing the Type 82 destroyerinto a small cruiser, thus dispensing with separate classes of cruisers and Type 82 destroyers.     At the same time the shipalready building will be completed as she will be a valuableaddition to the fleet;    she will also provide the means ofgaining early operational experience with the no?/ surface-to-airmissile system (SEA DART) combined with the Anglo-Dutch radar,whose development is now well advanced.     Cost:    around 30 million;    size:    around 10,000 tons;   Timescale:    early 1976.O3)   Destroyer:   It is proposed to substitute, for the Type 82 in itsdestroyer role, a ship of half its size and cost, to deploy SEADMT.     This will be a smaller version of the SEA DART destroyerwhich has figured in earlier plans.     A variant of this shipmight carry the IKARA anti-submarine weapon.     Cost:    around 12 million;    size:    around 3,500 tons;   Tine-scale:   mid-1973.(o)   Frigate:    These relatively lightly armed ships which will be thebackbone of any future fleet, will absorb less manpower than theLEANDERS which they replace.     Cost:    around  8 million;sise:    around 2,500 tons;    Timescale:    late 1974.
3 5 J.if.     It is visualised that, vdthin the total force levels set out in this paper, a class of three or four cruisers will ho built and that eventuallyabout one quarter of the destroyer/frigate force will consist of the newdestroyers.     By 1975-76, current plans envisage five SEA DART destroyerscompleted with another six on order, and three frigates completed, withsix more on order.     The first of the new cruisers will be nearing completion;   two or three more will bo on order.5. Approval is required for the new classes now, so that they can beIntroduced in time to implement these plans. It is also necessary todecide now that no more RN Phantom aircraft should be ordered.B. Array programme.     Reductions of Amy force levels will mean changes in the quantities of equipment ordered but not, in general, changes in types of equipment.     no decisions are required at this stage on major items of Army equipment;inthe 1970s.C. RAF programme.     In order to implement the RAF force levels envisaged for 1970-71 and1975-76, the following decisions are required:(a) P 1127.     There should be no further purchases of P 1127 overand above the sixty Combat aircraft and ten training aircraftalready approved by the Cabinet,(b) Phantom F4M.     No further purchases should be mado above theone hundred and sixteen aircraft already approved by OPD.This represents a further reduction of fourteen aircraft and means that the required Front Lino can only be maintained forseven years instead of the normal ten years, primarily bocauseof the limitations on dollar expenditure.(c) AFVG.     A total buy of 116 will be required.     This represents a reduction of 15 aircraft.(d) ^MS -     Tne revised requirement will be for 100 of the Strikeversion against 137 previously planned.     In addition there willbe a requirement for about 160 Trainers compared with 215previously planned.     A decision on the Strike and Trainerversions must be taken at the same time for production reasons..Q5 transport Aircraft.     Tho programme assumes that 15 C5 transport aircraft will be bought from the United States, deliveriesstarting in 1973-74-.     There is no need to take an immediate decision on the typo of aircraft required.(18)
Other Aircraft.     There will also bo requirements for snailnumbers of specialised aircraft such as an airborne early warning aircraft.Weapons.     There may be consequential adjustments to the RAFWeapon Programme, but it is too early to judge precisely what form these adjustments will take.Aldabra.     An early decision will be required on the developmentof Aldabra as   an airfield    and a separate paper is being prepared.
