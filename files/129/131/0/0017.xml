W. H.Ministry of Defence, S. W. 1.4th July. 1967
DEFENCE vJHITE paper i.      INTROD u OilOFThe Statement on the Defence Estimates, 1967 (Cmnd 3203)promised for later in the year another announcement aboutdefence policy and the Government&apos;s plans for the size andshape of the forces for the next decade.    This White Paperreports the progress which has been made.2.     At the end of the Defence Review we announced - in Part Iof the Statement on the Defence Estimates, 1966 (Cmnd 2901) -the decisions which we had taken in order to carry us close to the financial objective for 1969/70.    Since then, as partof the continuous process of reviewing defence policy and programmes, we have looked beyond 1969/70 in order to determinehow much money and how many men we must plan to have in the1970s in relation to the commitments and the tasks which-weforesee, and to the resources which the country can afford for defence.    We have followed the broad approach to future defence policy described in the Defence Review.    But we have also takenaccount of major developments of the last twelve months;    onthe economic side, a more pressing need to reduce OA^erseasexpenditure, a slower rate of growth than expected in theBritish economy, and the consequent necessity to keepGovernment expenditure as low as possible;    and, on thepolitical side, the evolution of Government policy inrelation to Europe, progress in revising NATO strategy, theMiddle East crisis, and developments in South East Asiafollowing the end of &quot;confrontation15.3.     Defence policy can never he static.&apos; The broad plansset out in this white Paper are designed both to providefirm decisions where these must be taken, and also to/allow
allow room for manoeuvre where changing circumstances may-require us to modify our plans.    Our aim has been to reconcilthe need for the Services to have a period of stability andto enable them to plan manpower and careers and to adapttheir equipment, training and support programmes to changesin their shape and size with the inescapable fact that,although we must exercise what foresight we can in ourplanning; we cannot by ourselves control the course ofevents in the world./II.p -
IT.      ETJROPSb-0     As was made clear in the Statements on Defence Estimates1966 (Grand 2901) and 1967 (cmnd. 3203), the security of britain still depends above all on the prevention of war inEurope.   The Government, therefore, regard it as essentialto maintain both the military efficiency and the politicalsolidarity of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.   Forthis purpose, we must continue to make a substantial contri-&quot;bution to not&apos;s forces in order to play our part in thedefence of Europe and to maintain the necessary balance withinthe Western allianceo    Our contribution will become moreimportant as we develop closer political and economic tiesbetween Britain and her European neighbours *5*     NATO has now adopted a continuous procedure for establishing force requirements five years ahead.   this gives us a firmer basis for planning our contribution tothe alliance.    Short of come new development,  such asprogress towards mutual reductions of forces by both NATOand the Warsaw Pact countries, we must new assume that our contribution to the alliance will remain broadly on thesame scale as at present, although we may be able to redeploysome of our forces in peacetime.6.     Since the publication of the Statement on defence estimates, 1967 (Cmnd 3203) last February, NATO has takenan important step in relating its strategy to the politicaland economic realities of the late 1960s.   At their meeting in May 1967, the Defence Ministers of the alliance agreed on political guidance which should be given to the militar&apos;&quot;authorities for future force planningj    it was based on areassessment of the threat confronting the alliance and of- 3 -
the resources available to meet it.   We have argued for sometime that, since a Soviet attack in Europe is unlikely inpresent circumstances, and that we shorld probably receiveample warning of any change in those circumstances, someof the forces required in Germany in an emergency could beheld elsewhere in peacetime, provided that they could bereturned promptly if a crisis occurred.la     We have proposed to our allies in NATO and V/HU thatwe should redeploy to the United Kingdom early in 1968one brigade of BA.CTR and one squadron of RAF, Germany.   Webelieve that, against the strategic background outlined above, these are reasonable proposals and are confident that they will he accepted by our allies.   They could leadto foreign exchange savings of about o5?M in a full year.The redeployment in itself would have little effect on thedefence budget since the forces concerned would remain inexistence in the United Kingdom and available to NATO inan emergency.8.     The long-term problem of meeting the foreign exchange cost of maintaining cur forces in Germany has not yet been resolved.;    but this is recognised by cur allies as a matterrequiring further consideration.   We have, however,concluded arrangements with the USA. and the federal government of Germany which will enable the bulk of our foreign exchange costs in Germany in 1967/68 to be covered.It remains our policy to find satisfactory arrangements tocover these costs thereafter and we are in touch with our allies about this.LI-
III.    ROLE AND DEPLOYMENT OUTSIDE EUROPE9.     The aim of our policy outside Europe is, as we said inthe Statement on Defence Estimates, 1967,  (Cmnd 3203) &quot;to fostedevelopments which will enable the local peoples to live atpeace without the presence of external forces&quot;, and thus toallow our forces to withdraw from their stations in the middle east and Far East.   We cannot predict exactly when the situatiowill make this possible in every area where our forces are nowstationed^ and,  in planning the withdrawal of our forces, wemust take account of the impact of our plans on the peoplesconcerned, and on the policies of our allies.   We remain responsible for the security of our dependencies; we haveobligations to our Commonwealth partners and allies; and our political and economic interest in the stability of the worldoutside Europe makes it desirable that we should retain somecapacity for contributing to the maintenance of peace where wecan usefully do so with international agreement.10.   But, the way in which we should discharge our responsibilities and make our contribution to peace-keeping iscontinually changing.    In the next decade? new aircraft willenable us to move forces across the world faster and in larger numbers than was possible even a few years ago.   The military strength of our friends and allies is growing.    The power and policy of our potential adversaries are also liable to change.,And we must watch the effect of the rising costs of defence onthe economic state of the nation, since our internationalinfluence will continue -to depend as much on the soundness ofour economy as on our military strength.11.    The Government explained in the Statement on the defence estimates, 1966 (Cmnd 2901) that it would not undertake major operations of war except in co-operation with allies; and wouldmake the commitments to our friends dependent on the provision/in time
in time of whatever facilities we needed on the spot.   Ourplanning since then has led to   four important conclusions.Firstly, as our friends and allies outside Europe build up their own forces, they will value most from Britain a contribution in those sophisticated forces which some of themmay find it difficult to provide for themselves.    Secondly,the manpower and fixed facilities in our military bases may come to cost more than is required by the type of militaryoperations which the Government foresees.  Thirdly, the visiblepresence of even small forces - not necessarily dependent onlarge and expensive base facilities - may be a valuabledeterrent.    Fourthly,  in a crisis,  it will be more economicalto rely mainly on sending-forces from Britain, so long as some reduction in speed of reaction and some initial restriction inthe role of the reinforcements can be accepted.12.    The Government has therefore revised its plans fordeploying forces outside Europe so as to enable major reductions to be made in the size and cost of our forces as a whole.   Wehave had to make assumptions about the pace at which the revisedplans can be carried out; but we may wish to carry out theprogramme of reduction and redeployment either more slowly ormore quickly according to political or economic need.13.    The Government has already announced, and gone some way to implement, plans for the reductions in the Mediterranean, theSouth Atlantic and the Caribbean.    It has also announced itsplan to withdraw from South Arabia and the Aden base inJanuary 1968.    For a short time after independence, however,we shall provide     British naval and air forces in the area toassist the new state to deter and,  if need be, to meet external aggression.   7e are also increasing the financial and other assistance which we are giving towards the build-up and improvement of the South Arabian forces.
1h.    In the Fan East the Government has decided to reduce theforces deployed in Singapore and Malaysia by about half by1970/71.   At present, the total number of men and women working in or for the Services in Singapore and Malaysia- is about80,000.    This includes Servicemen, civilians and ships&apos;companies on sea service in the Far East.    By April 1968, thetotal is estimated to be about 70,000, reflecting tho second stage of the reduction of 20,000 in the Far East following theend of &quot;confrontation&quot;.   Between April 1968 and 1970/71 we expect a further reduction in Singapore and Malaysia of about30,000, leaving a total of about u0,000, of which about halfwill be civilians.    The reductions will be so phased that, bythe early 1970s, the British forces still stationed in singapore and Malaysia will consist largely of naval (including anamphibious force) and air forces - though there will still beGurkha forces in Malaysia.    Corresponding cuts will be made inour base facilities.    These reductions have now been set inhand on the basis of the closest possible working relationship with the Governments of Singapore and. Malaysia, and on theunderstanding that they will be accompanied, by significant aid to help those Governments to counteract the effects on theireconomi es,15.    The Government intends to change its Far East commitmentsparallel with these reductions.    We shall continue to honourour obligations under SEATO, but the forces assigned to specificSEATO plans will be progressively reduced.   As we come to relymore on reinforcement from Britain, we shall make clear that weshall need a longer time in which to deploy any forces which we decide to contribute.   Britain will honour her obligations imderthe Anglo/Malaysian Defence Agreements  there will beconsultations on the way in which we should plan to meet them.The Government will also continue making a significant/contribution ion- 7 -
contribution to the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve, which contains naval, land and air forces.    This is a matter which,with the future of the Commonwealth Brigade, we are discussing with our Commonwealth partners.i6.    It is not at present possible to plan in the same detail the period beyond 1970/71.   The reductions over the next fewyears will be substantial: the Government is determined thatthey will take place in an orderly manner, which will enable our commonwealth partners to adjust their plans, and will allowSingapore and Malaysia   to make the necessary economictransition as smoothly as possible.   We plan to withdrawaltogether from our bases in Singapore and Malaysia in the middle1970s; but the precise timing of our eventual withdrawal will depend on progress made in achieving a new basis for stability in South East Asia and in resolving other problems in the far east.17o   Meanwhile, our plans must be firm enough to ensure that wehave the forces we need to match our remaining commitments inthe Far East and elsewhere, and e        flexible enough to enable us to respond, to changes in local circumstances.    However wemay think that events will turn out, we cannot plan on theassumption that v/e shall never have to use our forces outside europe, where we shall retain dependencies and other obligationsfor the foreseeable future.   We are therefore planning tomaintain a military capability for use, if required, in the far east - even when we no longer have forces permanently based inthe area.18.   We do not need to settle the precise character,  size and deployment of this capability now.    It would be largely composed,however, of the forces of all three Services which would be stationed in this country for employment   as a strategic reserve; and we should probably keep in the Far East some ofthe naval and amphibious forces included in it.    The discussions/which
which, are continuing with the Australian Government about thepossibility of our having facilities in Australia, and the examination we are making of a new staging airfield in theBritish Indian Ocean Territory, are designed to lead to the flexibility required by our long-term defence planning./IV.      THE FORCES
IV.  :  THE FORCES19.    The progress made in the revision of NATO strategy and force planning and the evolution of our future policyoutside Europe, have made it possible to reach broaddecisions on the long-term shape and size of our forces,and for reducing the facilities and administrative services which support them.Tjie Royal Navy20.    The Polaris force will he Britain&apos;s contribution tothe strategic nuclear deterrent of the West.     The Navywill also continue to play a leading part in the maritimeof NATO &quot;shield forces/and to provide for the foreseeable future a valuable peace-keeping capability outside Europe by theunobstrusive and flexible exercise of maritime power.For these roles our naval forces require the ability tofight and survive in the environment of the guided missileand nuclear-powered submarine;    they must,  therefore,include some ships of the highest capability.      Air power will he as indispensable to the Fleet of tomorrow as today;the Navy, like the Army, will rely on the ability of theRoyal Air Force land-based aircraft to support their forces.21.    Apart from the Polaris submarines,  the main strikingpower of the Navy will be provided by the growing force of nuclear-powered submarines.     For the surface fleet, moreLEANDER frigates will be ordered;    and a small frigate isbeing planned as a successor, which will carry a new close-range surface-to-air guided missile to follow SEACAT,  a medium-range gun, and a new general purpose helicopter toreplace the WASP.     The Type 82 destroyer now on orderwill be completed;    the design will not be continued in itspresent form for further ships of this class, but will be/developed
developed in two ways.      It will &quot;be enlarged into the newclass of cruisers,  forecast in the statement on the defence estimates,  1966 (Cmnd.  2901), to succeed the convertedTIGER class cruisers;    and also scaled down for a new classof smaller destroyers.      The cruisers, which will providecommand and control facilities for our naval forces, willhe armed, like the Type 825 with the SEA DART surface-to-air guided missile system.      In addition, they will carry a force of the new SEA KING helicopters armed with anti-submarine weapons and. eonar,     The new destroyers will carry a modified version of SEA. DART and a smaller helicopter;every ship from frigate upwards will have the most effectivecapacity for reconnaissance and attack that helicopters can offer.The^ Army22.    The Army will continue to provide the major british contribution to NATO.     The redeployment of a brigade fromGermany would not affect the Army&apos;s force levels, becausethe brigade would remain earmarked, for assignment to NATO,as stated in paragraph 7 above.     The accommodation programme already in hand to provide for withdrawals referred to inthe Statement on the Defence Estimates 19^7 (Cmnd.. 3203) hasbeen extended to cover the additional numbers now returning,including those from BAOR.23.    The size of the Army outside Europe will be graduallyreduced.     All our troops will leave South Arabia after independence comes in 1968;    the increase In the garrisonstationed in the Persian Gulf to meet our remainingobligations will be small.     We are reducing the Cyprusgarrison this year.      In Malta a phased withdrawal will be complete   by the end of 1971.      In the Ear East,  the mainreductions will be made in Malaysia and Singapore;    but the-H ... /garrison
garrison in Hong Kong will be maintained.     When our forces have been withdrawn from the Aden base in January1968 the Strategic Reserve will be strengthened by a furtherInfantry brigade.2U.    Our plans for the reorganisation of the Infantry were announced in the House of Commons in May.     They will bring greater economy and efficiency without destroying the individual identity of Infantry Regiments.      A newArmy Strategic Command will be formed later in 1968.      Thiswill command all field force formations and units stationed in Britain apart from formations earmarked for assignmentto NATO and employed on public duties and training.      Ingeneral, though it will be smaller,  the Army will remainbalanced,  and well-equipped.The Royal Air Force25. There will be no change in the role of the Royal AirForce, which will remain as described in the Statements onthe Defence Estimates 1966 (Cmnd.  2901) and 1967 (Cmnd.3203).26.    Major decisions about the future equipment for the RAFhave already been announced and a pjeriod of large-scalere-equipment with new aircraft has already begun.     Theonly changes now planned relate to the size of the forces required:    in particular, because the forces will be smaller,  it will not now be necessary to order any furtherPhantoms.     /This passage to be amended in light of reviewof AFVG- project^&quot;.Reductions^^ij^^uppprt27.    Base Facilities - This redeployment of our forces willenable us to run down stocks and supporting facilitiesoverseas, particularly in the Far East.
CZCRET28528.    We intend to reduce supporting services still further in three ways.      In the first place,  the smaller size ofthe forces will in itself produce reductions in their support.      In the second place, we shall make the supporting services more efficient by advanced management techniques and the wider use of computers.      Finally, the plans whichare being worked out in detail by each Service will become-ordinated to eliminate duplication and to bring aboutgreater rationalisation.29.    We plan to make substantial cuts in both uniformedand civilian support personnel, to close some supply depots,to amalgamate some training establishments, and to reducecertain stocks and reserves.30.    MJ^isJ^rx^f^eX^A0^-J^^Q^ru^arr&apos;.&quot;*:,e,p,s.&apos;      In. the short term,the planning and execution of defence policy decisions willcreate more work in the Ministry of Defence and we cannot expect to make substantial reductions in the immediate future.We shall, however,  cut staffs,  as soon as we can andwherever possible,  as the result of the reductions in the size of the forces,  the changes in our overseas commitments,the cuts in some capabilities,  the curtailment of supportfunctions,  the streamlining and rationalisation of our general organisation and the continued improvement of management techniques.     We hope that reductions will alsoresult from the further evolution of defence organisation.31.    We have also reviewed the defence research anddevelopment programme.      A reduction of about  30m is tobe made in It,  affecting development projects as well asresearch done in Government establishments and in industry.This will free scientific manpower and other valuableresources for civil work.- 13

The officers and men concerned will be compensated by payments on the lines set out in an annex to this White Paper.     Detailed plans will take somemonths to be worked out by all three Services and will bepublished as soon as possible.3k.    We shall also extend the facilities for resettlementtraining.      In addition, v/e are making plans, which will shortly he promulgated to the Services,  to give positiveand practical help to those leaving the Services so thatthey can find suitable employment in civil life.35.    The reduction and reorganisation of base facilities at home and abroad and the further streamlining of theMinistry of Defence headquarters will reduce the number of civilians required to support combat forces within theUnited Kingdom and in the overseas commands by about 1+5,000UK civilians and 55,000 local entrants.     There will he full&apos; ^ &quot; / c on su It at i on service Manpower32.    We intend that by March 1971 the active strengths ofthe forces shall fall by nearly 37,000,  as follows:-US                                        UKAdult., Males                  Women and Boys (see note&quot;&apos;&quot;- ------ - -................- &apos;3)eTovTj&quot;*&apos;&apos;
A. ^ ..COST- 15 -consultation with the appropriate staff associations andtrade unions about these reductions as the plans develop,Manpower Sumrnarv,360    To sum up, we are planning to achieve a reduction inthe present strengths of UK Service manpower which will amount to nearly 37,000 by March 1971,  and to a total ofabout 75,000 by the mid 1970s,     We are also planning1 re due-tions of civilian manpower, both UK and. locally entered,  ofthe order 03? 100,000 over the same period.     These reductionswill be gradually reflected in cuts in the capability ofall three Services - fewer ships, units and squadrons than we deploy today, and. corresponding reductions in our equipmentprogrammes.
V.     COST37.    As one of the main financial objectives of theDefence Review, we set a target of  2,000m.  (at 196k prices)to be reached in 1969/70.      Since,  as explained to theHouse of Commons in 1966,  the final decisions to complete the Defence Review could not be taken before the end of&quot;confrontation&quot;, the equipment programmes, manpower strengthsand deployments currently planned would have led to a defence budget in the region of  2,100m.  at I96U prices in 1970/71.The plans now worked out,  on the basis in particular of thenew approach to policy in the Far East, will enable thedefence budget for 1970/71 to be reduced by a further 200m.      Not all the economies now planned will be realised&quot;by 1970/71, and the Government expects the annual level ofdefence expenditure to have dropped by the mid-1970s by afurther  100m.     A small part of these savings will be off-set in the short run by the cost of dealing with the reductions and redeployment, and of providing compensationterms for those who become redundant.      In addition, as already stated, the Government is committed to providesignificant financial aid to Malaysia and Singapore andSouth Arabia.38.    The decisions of the Government Will also reduce levels of overseas defence expenditure.     Annex H to the statement on the Defence Estimates I967 (Cmnd. 3203)  showed that,  apartfrom Germany, where some separate means of balancing our foreign exchange outgoings must be found, local defence expenditure is expected to drop from  173m. to ;o152m. bythe end of the current financial year.     The plans outlined in this paper will enable a further  30m.  to be saved by1970/71.     This is a cut of about 30&apos;/ in the present level,16 /yij^J2SM2MIMIM&apos;
VI.      CONCLUSION39.    This f/hite Paper completes the process which has requiredalmost three years&apos; continuous work revising Britain&apos;s overseaspolicy, formulating the role of military force to supportit, and planning the forces required to carry out thisrole.     The decisions have been reached after extensiveconsultations with our allies, and their views have beentaken fully into account.     They spring from the bestassessment we can make of 3ritain!s interests and responsi--bilities, and of the changing world in which they will be protected or exercised.U-0.    Substantial savings will be made in the manpower andfinancial resources required for defence.      .Ve plan no major change in the size of our contribution to NATO,although a higher proportion of our forces may in future be stationed in this country.     The savings will be chieflyobtained from a significant reduction in our militarypresence outside Europe, and in some changes in the way inwhich we shall be able to deploy our military capabilityoutside Europe.     We believe that our allies appreciate thatwe are doing everything possible to establish our plans onan economic basis that we can sustain.    They also recognise the value of the continuing though, reduced contribution which -we shall be nrlang to the maintenance of peace,hi.    The Services will still have an indispensable role to play in support of Britain&apos;s foreign policy.     TheGovernment is sure that the Royal Navy, Army and Royal AirForce,  though smaller in size, will be capable of meetingthe demands that may be made on them.     Whatever thosedemands may prove to be, we can be certain that they willcontinue to be exacting in operational and technical skill -and that they will often arise at short notice,  as they have in the past.A2.  ...
- 1842.   More of our forces will be based in Britain;    andservicemen should see more of their families..      the operational tasks to be done outside Britain will requireas high a standard of operational roadiness and training as those of today.     The Services which we shall maintainwill be of a quality of which the men and women whoserve in them, and the country as a whole,  can be proud.
ANNEX TO JULY MITE,.PAPERRedundancy payments o     In accordance with established practice, officersand men whose careers are prematurely terminated willho entitled to compensation;    this will take accountof the curtailment of their expected Service careers,their loss of prospects, the higher rates of pensionaccruing from longer service, and also the additionaldifficulties which they may experience in starting-new careers in civilian life.Officers2.     For officers serving on permanent commissions whoare permaturely retired, compensation will he in theform of a lump-sura payment which,  to meet all the factors mentioned in the preceding paragraph, will reach at the maximum the equivalent of 21 months&apos;basic pay (ic excluding additional pay, marriage andration allowance).3.     Payments will reach this level when the officerhas given 13 years&apos;  qualifying service and willdecrease when the officer has less than 5 years&apos;service to complete before his expected retirementdate.U,     Payments will be based on the pay in issue forthe rank held on relinquishment of last appointment,whether this be acting, temporary or substantive.
5.     Normal retirement benefits will not be affected,except that the normal requirement of 2 years&apos; service in the substantive rank will be waived.     those officers who would not normally qualify for retired pay on compulsory retirement, because they have lessthan 16 years&apos; reekonable service, will be grantedretired pay as if they had been invalided, providedthat they have given at least 10 years&apos; qualifyingservice.6. Special arrangements will apply to certain categories of officers serving on non-permanent commisions.Ratings8 Soldi^s^jincl^Alrja^n7.     The full scale of compensation for ratings,soldiers and airmen serving on pensionable engage-commitments  has been based on the same general considera-tions as for officers;   but, owing to the difference in their engagement and pension terms, the schemefor other ranks has been devised on different lines in order to mitigate the loss of entitlement to pension which they would otherwise suffer on prematureretirement.8.     The main features of the scheme arc that&quot;a. The minimum period of qualifying service for pension has been reduced from 22 years to10 years (after the age of 18)./b.- 2 -
b.     For the purpose of calculating pension and terminal grant for those who have servedat least 10 years, an additional credit of up to U. years&apos; service will be given, providedthat this addition does not extend theirreckonable service beyond the end of thecurrent engagement.9.     In addition, other ranks with 10 years&apos; qualifyingservice will receive lump-sum payments rising to amaximum of 12 months&apos; basic pay (ie excluding additionalpay, marriage and ration allowance) after 16 years&apos;qualifying service, but decreasing for those with lessthan 5 years   to complete on current engagement.Those men with 3 or more, but less than 10 years&apos;completed service from age 18,who will not be eligiblefor pension and terminal grant, will receive a gratuityon invaliding terms, plus a lump sum ranging from to lh months&apos; basic pay.10.    Special arrangements will apply,to certain categories of other ranks serving on non-pensionableengagements.
