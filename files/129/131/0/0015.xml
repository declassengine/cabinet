THE KENNEDY ROUND OF TRADE NEGOTIATIONS, 1964-671. One of the main objectives of the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade* is the reduction and stabilisation of tariffs on a reciprocal basis. Tothis end five rounds of multilateral negotiations were held between 1947and 1962: the fifth (1960-62) was known as the Dillon Round.f The sixth,known generally as the Kennedy Round, was the most ambitious attempt everundertaken to lower barriers to world trade. It opened on 4th May 1964and was concluded on 30th June 1967.background. The impetus for the Kennedy Round came in the main from twodevelopments. The first was a meeting in Geneva in November 1961 ofMinisters of the Contracting Parties to the General Agreement. ministers agreed that further work on trade liberalisation in the GATT, after theconclusion of the Dillon Round, should take account of certain views expressed during the meeting. The first was that the usefulness of theitem by item bargaining hitherto used in GATT tariff conferences (in whichlists of specific requests for tariff concessions were exchanged) had been largely exhausted; a linear approach involving tariff cuts across the board with a minimum of exceptions might yield better results. Secondly, severalagricultural exporting countries felt that previous tariff negotiations hadbeen concerned almost entirely with industrial tariff reductions; little hadbeen done to negotiate comparable opportunities for increased access forthe major agricultural commodities in world trade. Thirdly, it was generally agreed that the problems of reducing barriers to the trade of the less developed countries should receive greater attention than they had done inthe past.3. The second development was the passage by the United StatesCongress in October 1962 of the Trade Expansion Act. This gave theUnited States Administration very wide tariff-cutting- powers, including inparticular the authority to cut tariffs across the board, subject to reciprocity,by up to 50 per cent. This very wide-ranging authority obtained by the latePresident Kennedy from Congress made possible the trade negotiations which came to bear his name.4. Against this background GATT Ministers met in Geneva in May 1963to decide the broad lines on which the next trade negotiation (already knownas the Kennedy Round) should be conducted. They agreed that these negotiations should open in Geneva on 4th May 1964 and should be basedon certain guide lines which took account of the points made in paragraph above, and which included in addition the need to deal with non-tariff barriers to trade (such barriers, as for example, certain Customs procedures and technical regulations, can frustrate the benefits of tariff reductions).* Review of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

Objectives5. The negotiations therefore, which duly opened on 4th May 1964 hada much wider scope than previous GATT tariff conferences. The kennedy round had four main objectives:(a) a substantial reduction in tariffs. The plan adopted, following the ministerial Meeting of May 1963 provided for offers to be made onthe basis of an across-the-board tariff cut of 50 per cent. Theseoffers would be subject only to &apos; a bare minimum of exceptions &apos; and,naturally, to possible modifications later to obtain a balance of offers;(b) substantial progress in the elimination or reduction of non-tariff barriers to trade;(c) the effective inclusion for the first time in GATT negotiations ofagriculture; the aim was to &apos; provide for acceptable conditions of access to world markets for agricultural products&apos; and the UnitedStates made its view clear from the start that an agreement on international trade in cereals was an indispensable condition of a successful Kennedy Round;(d) reductions in barriers to the exports of the less developed countries.It was agreed that full reciprocity in tariff concessions should notbe expected from the less developed countries.Negotiations6. The length of the negotiations reflected their much wider scopecompared with previous GATT tariff negotiations. Much time was spentat the outset on the problem caused by disparities in levels of tariffs. TheEuropean Economic Community maintained that its Common External Tariffwas lower and more uniform in its incidence than the tariffs of the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom (particularly the former) and that an equallinear cut would be unfair to the low tariff country. Others argued thatdisparity claims of this kind could have serious consequences for third countries and that, in any case, equivalent percentage reductions in tariffswould often bring more advantage to the country exporting over the highertariff rates. It was finally agreed that this problem^would have to be settledpragmatically as part of the final package. Most of the main participantstabled lists of exceptions to a linear cut (50 per cent on the basis of theworking hypothesis agreed) in industrial tariffs, in November 1964. Theinclusion of agriculture also provoked lengthy discussions. Offers of conces-sions in the field of agriculture were eventually tabled by most participantsin September 1965; this was followed by offers by the Community (and supplementary offers from some other participants) in August 1966. Theway was then open for the final phase of the negotiations.7. This final phase took place against the clock since the powers madeavailable to the President of the United States under the Trade ExpansionAct of 1962 were due to expire on 30th June 1967. It was essential thatthe negotiations should be concluded some weeks ahead of 30th June in orderto give the United States Administration time to prepare the complexdocumentation required for the Presidents approval. The most intensivepart of the negotiation took place in April and the first half of May.  It was
uncertain until the last minute whether the result would be success or failure:the deadline, of Sunday, 14th May, previously agreed, had to be extended by one day. The success of the negotiation was assured when the fourmain participants the United States of America, the European economic community, the United Kingdom and Japan accepted a final package of proposals made by the Director-General of the GATT which containedelements of equal unpalatability to each. The United States accepted smallertariff cuts by the e.c. and the United Kingdom in the first part of the chemical package than the cuts they were themselves conceding; the EECagreed to a range of concessions on agricultural items; Japan agreed to makea contribution to the food aid programme which formed part of theagreement on cereals; and the United Kingdom agreed to a cut by one-fifthin her tariffs on iron and steel this applied to both the ad valorem and thealternative specific rates of duty. Agreement on these points enabled theDirector-General to announce at around midnight on 15th May 1967 thatthe essential elements in the Kennedy Round had been successfully negotiated.Participation8. The following participated in the Kennedy Round: Argentina,Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Ceylon, Chile, Czechoslovakia, Denmark,Dominican Republic, European Economic Community, Finland, Greece,Iceland, India, Indonesia, the. Republic of Ireland, Israel, Jamaica, Japan,Republic of Korea, Malawi, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Norway,Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Spain, Sweden,Switzerland, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, United Arab Republic, the UnitedKingdom,* United States of America, Uruguay and Yugoslavia. In addition,certain countries formally notified their intention of participating in the trade negotiations under the plan for the participation of the less developed countries but did not present statements of the offers they would make asa contribution to the objectives of the trade negotiations; these countries wereCyprus, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Malta, Niger, Togo and Uganda. Thusforty-nine countries (counting the European Economic Community as one)were concerned in the Kennedy Round.Results(a) Format9. The results of the tariff negotiations are embodied in the schedulesto the &apos; Geneva (1967) Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade &apos;. The tariff schedule of each country fixes contractually the maximumduties to be levied on imports from any other Contracting Party of the products specified. There is also a memorandum of agreement on the basicelements to be included in a world grains arrangement, an agreement onimplementation of Article VI of the GATT (in effect an internationalanti-dumping code) and an agreement on chemical tariffs. Protocols havebeen agreed for the accession to the GATT of Poland, Iceland, the irish republic and Argentina. The texts of these documents (other than theprotocols for accession) are reproduced in the Appendix.   The tariff* The United Kingdom also notified the Contracting Parties that it was participatingon behalf of those dependent territories in respect of which it had provisionally acceptedthe General Agreement.
schedules will be published in Geneva in late August or early September andwill be on sale through Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office; in the meantimeadvance copies have been placed in the libraries of both Houses of parliament and the Board of Trade will be able to answer detailed enquiries.(b) Tariffs10. In the industrial field (/.*?., products covered by Chapters 25-99 ofthe United Kingdom tariff) important tariff cuts were agreed, in many casesup to 50 per cent, and averaging well over 30 per cent on trade between nearlyfifty countries. Reductions in agricultural tariffs were less important sincemuch of international trade in agricultural products is subject to barriersother than tariffs; nevertheless a range of tariff reductions was achieved.11. The European Economic Community, the United States and Japantook respectively 19 per cent, 12 per cent and 1 per cent of our exports in1966. Of the other countries participating in the Kennedy Round many werecountries in the Commonwealth preference area or members of EFTA (these areas between them took 49 per cent of our exports in 1966); two were state trading countries (Poland and Czechoslovakia); and the remainder weremostly countries outside the Commonwealth preference area which classedthemselves as less developed and from which, according to the rules of thenegotiations, full reciprocity could not be expected.12. The European Economic Community agreed in the negotiations toreduce the Common External Tariff on a very wide range of goods of interestto British exporters, in many cases by 50 per cent. These concessions includecars and parts (22 per cent to 11 per cent see paragraph 25), aircraftengines and aircraft parts (10-15 per cent to 5-1 \ per cent), textile machinery(8-15 per cent to 4-7h per cent), photographic and cinematographic equipment(12-18 per cent to 7-13 per cent), transmission belts, tyres and rubber tubing(12-18 per cent to 6-10 per cent), hand tools (9-14 per cent to 5-9 per cent),agricultural and horticultural machinery (9-10 per cent to 4-7^ per cent),leather (6-10 per cent to 3-8 per cent), mechanical handling equipment (8-11per cent to 4-9 per cent), furniture (17 per cent to 8^ per cent), cigarettes(180 per cent to 90 per cent) and whisky, gin and beer (reductions of about one-fifth). In total British exports affected by these reductions in the common external Tariff were worth some  603 million in 1964, some 85 per cent ofour dutiable exports to the Community. (These figures, and the equivalentfigures in paragraphs 13-15, relate to import figures, c.i.f., of the countries concerned. Figures for 1964 are given because this is the latest year forwhich comparable figures of imports under tariff headings were available during the negotiations for the major participants.)13. Averages of tariffs can be misleading. But two sets of figures show the extent to which the Common External Tariff will be reduced. First,the average reduction in the Common Tariff on dutiable industrial imports into the e.c. from the United Kingdom will amount (weighted by imports in 1964) to some 36 per cent. Secondly, the e.c. Commission calculate thatthe median Common External Tariff rate for industrial goods is some 12 percent; an average reduction of 35 per cent on all imports from third countries(the e.c. Commission^ preliminary estimate of the result of the kennedy round) will reduce this median rate to some 8 per cent; over tariffs of this
range (examples of new rates for individual products of importance to Britishexporters are given in paragraph 12 above) British industry should be in amuch better position than hitherto to compete with manufacturers in theCommon Market.14. The United States also agreed to wide-ranging reductions in its tariffof benefit to British exporters. These reductions included cars (6-^ per cent to 3 per cent), whisky (SI -02 per proof gallon to 51 cents), motor cycles and parts (10 per cent to 5 per cent), bicycles (11^ per cent to 5\ per cent),cashmere sweaters (22 per cent to 17 per cent), chinaware (25-35 per cent to\2\ril-\ per cent), safety razor blades (12^- per cent to 6\ per cent), recordplayers and tape recorders (11^ per cent to 5-J- per cent) and automaticaircraft landing equipment (12 per cent to 6 per cent), chocolate (10 per cent to 5 per cent), sugar confectionery (14 per cent to 7 per cent) and biscuits(6^ per cent to 3 per cent). In total, British exports affected by these reductions in United States tariffs were worth some  304 million in 1964,91 per cent of our dutiable exports to the United States. The averagereduction in the tariffs at present imposed by the United States on dutiableindustrial imports from the United Kingdom (including whisky, which is classified as an industrial product by the United States) amounted to some41 per cent.15. Japan takes substantially less British exports than the two majormarkets mentioned above. But tariff reductions of benefit to British exportsinclude wool textiles (20 per cent to 10-15 per cent), tractors (20 per cent to10 per cent), cars (40 per cent to 20-30 per cent) and record players (30 percent to 15 per cent). British exports affected by these reductions in Japanesetariffs were worth some  39 million in 1964, 7 per cent of our exports to japan. The average reduction on dutiable industrial imports into japan from the United Kingdom amounted to some 35 per cent.16. Tariff reductions by the United Kingdom. In return for thesewide ranging tariff concessions, we undertook to make reductions of comparable size in the United Kingdom tariff. These include tyres (24 percent to 12 per cent), leather footwear (10-20 per cent to 5-10 per cent), pumps(12-14 per cent to 1\ per cent), textile machinery (12-14 per cent to 7-J-20 percent), mechanical handling equipment (12-14 per cent to 1\ per cent), printingmachinery (12-14 per cent to 1\ per cent), typewriters, calculating and otheroffice machines and parts (6-16 per cent to 3-7^ per cent), photographic andcinematographic equipment (15-50 per cent to 7^-20 per cent),gramophones and records, tape recorders and tapes (10-33+, per cent to 5-12Jper cent), oranges (10 per cent to 5 per cent), soya beans (5 per cent to free),and canned salmon (5 per cent to 2\ per cent). The average reduction inour tariffs on dutiable industrial goods imported from our three mainnegotiating partners was closely in line with what we received from them 37 per cent in the case of the e.c., 40 per cent in the case of the UnitedStates and 34 per cent in the case of Japan. In so far as out total imports are concerned from countries outside the Commonwealth preference area and EFTA, the average reduction in our tariff on industrial goods willapproach 40 per cent. The value of goods (imported from m.f.n. sources)affected by these tariff reductions in 1964 was  999 million, of which 500 million came from the e.c.,  325 million from the United States and
 34 million from Japan. The value of our dutiable agricultural imports in1964 from all m.f.n. sources which will be affected by tariff reductions was 157 million.The outcome in certain industrial sectors17. In certain major sectors, action by the United Kingdom will dependin large measure on action by others. In the chemicals negotiations, the major difficulty was the existence of the American Selling Price (ASP)system of valuation which raises tariffs on benzenoid chemicals imported into the United States to levels which are often prohibitive (the highest ratereaching 172 per cent of the f.o.b. value). In these circumstances, theUnited Kingdom and the European Economic Community sought to makethe full concessions they offered dependent on the abolition of ASP. TheUnited States pointed out, however, that the Trade Expansion Act gave theUnited States Administration no authority to abolish ASP; separate legislation would have to be sought from Congress; essential to this would be adequateconcessions in chemicai tariffs by others and also action on non-tariff barriers.18. After long and difficult negotiation, agreement was reached on apackage in two parts. The first part would involve a reduction by 50 percent in United States chemical duties (except those of 8 per cent or belowwhich would be reduced by 20 per cent); the United Kingdom and theEuropean Economic Community would reduce their chemical duties by30 per cent in the case of duties of 25 per cent or more, and by 20 per centin the case of the remainder; both would make deeper cuts on certainchemicals (in particular dyestuffs). The United Kingdom would not makeany reductions in its 10 per cent tariffs on plastics.19. The second part of the package necessarily separate since it wouldinvolve new legislation in the United States would be the passage by theUnited States Congress of a bill to abolish ASP and to convert the tariffsalready reduced in the first part of the package to ad valorem equivalentswith a ceiling of 20 per cent (30 per cent in the case of dyestuffs and25-27 per cent in the case of certain sulpha drugs). In other words UnitedStates chemical tariffs would be reduced over a large range of products from well over 50 per cent to a maximum of 20 per cent. Tariffs of 8 percent and below would be cut by 50 per cent. In return, the e.c. would extend its cuts in chemical tariffs to a full 50 per cent across the board;the United Kingdom would maintain its 10 per cent duties on plastics untilthe Common External Tariff came down to the same level; thereafter, ona few items, our duties and the CET would be further reduced, in step, tosomewhat lower levels. We would also reduce our 33^ per cent rates to12\ per cent, and halve our other duties. This action on the part of all three participants would be subject to certain exceptions. Japan wouldmake the full 50 per cent cut with a number of exceptions.20. If the package deal negotiated at Geneva is implemented in full, the chemical tariffs of the major world producers will be harmonised, largelybetween 1\ per cent and 20 per cent; the formerly prohibitive UnitedStates tariff wall against many organic chemical imports will be reduced to20 per cent or below; our plastics tariff will be harmonised with that of theCommunity; and our chemical exports to the Community (12 per cent
approximately of our total dutiable exports to the Six) will get the benefitof a 50 per cent reduction across the board in the Common Tariff with onlyminor exceptions. The settlement, particularly if ASP is abolished, shouldbe of considerable value to the United Kingdom chemical industry and to international trade in chemical products.21. The Community undertook, if Congress abolished ASP, to modify the tax levied in certain Member States on cars by engine capacity so asto eliminate discrimination against larger cars. The United Kingdomundertook, if Congress abolished ASP, to reduce by a quarter theCommonwealth margin of preference on unmanufactured tobacco (thepreference is at present Is. 6Jd. on a revenue duty of  4 7s. 4^-d.).Switzerland is also making additional concessions to the United States.The details of this settlement are embodied in a separate agreement betweenthe United States, the European Economic Community, the United Kingdomand Switzerland, the text of which is given in the Appendix.22. Steel. The United Kingdom offered at the outset of the negotiations to apply the full linear cut to its tariff on iron and steel (most of thecurrent rates are 10 per cent with alternative specific rates which increasethe effective incidence of the duty when prices are depressed) providing that substantial reciprocity was obtained in the steel sector. The European coal and Steel Community, however, offered only to return to the level of duties(averaging between 6 per cent and 7 per cent) which applied before theirtemporary increase to 9 per cent early in 1964. The United Kingdomargued that in these circumstances reciprocity could not be obtained since in a bilateral agreement between the United Kingdom and the ECSC in1957 British duties had been reduced to 10 per cent in return for ratesof 6 per cent to 7 per cent in the ECSC; now all that the ECSC were offering was to restore the 1957 level of duties. The Community argued that it was not realistic for them to envisage reductions substantially below6 per cent to 7 per cent in their tariff which was already the lowest ofall the major steel producers (although it offered some marginal reductions);what was needed was some measure of harmonisation of steel dutiesamong the major world producers. This impasse persisted until the end ofthe negotiations. It then became clear that without some reduction in ourduties, the ECSC would not bring down its rates from their current leveland this in turn would lead to widespread withdrawals of offers by theCommunity on steel intensive goods and withdrawals by other participants.The Director General of the GATT thereupon included in his final packageof suggestions to resolve the deadlock (see paragraph 7) the proposal thatthe United Kingdom cut its 10 per cent ad valorem rates on iron and steel to per cent and reduce by 20 per cent its alternative specific duties. Sinceacceptance of the final package proposed was essential to the success ofthe negotiations, the United Kingdom agreed. In return, the European coal and Steel Community&apos;s rates will be reduced to an average of 5-7 per cent.The United States will align (subject to a maximum cut of 50 per cent) itsrates with those of the Community. Japan will, in general, reduce itsrates by 50 per cent.23. Textiles. Because of the general concern over textile importsamong the main negotiating countries, the cuts in this sector are less deepthan those in most other sectors.   The United Kingdom&apos;s offers will result11
in a tariff cut of about 20 per cent on dutiable imports of textiles as a group. We are making no cut at all on textiles or garments wholly ofcotton, wool, linen or jute and only small cuts on textiles containing amixture of natural and man-made fibres. Our cuts on man-made fibres,on textiles of man-made fibres or silk and on garments containingman-made fibres or silk, are larger, in a few cases up to the full 50 percent, but these duties will in no case be reduced below the rate for textilesof natural fibres and in most cases will remain above it, sometimessubstantially so. The cuts by the e.c., United States and Japan are also,on average, about 20 per cent. The scope of the products on which theywill make reductions is important. They will all be making significantreductions in their duties on cotton textiles (the e.c. by about 20 per cent).Reductions in United States tariffs on cotton goods and man-made fibretextiles average some 20 per cent. The United States will be making somecuts on one or two of our woollen textiles specialities, including cashmeresweaters and hosiery.24. In the separate but related discussions for the renewal of the GATTLong Term Arrangement on cotton textiles, both the United States andthe e.c. have agreed to substantial increases in their import quotas.25. Motor vehicles. Agreement was reached to halve the duty on carsin the United Kingdom, e.c., United States and Japan. Tariffs on carswill thus come down in both the United Kingdom and the e.c. to 11 percent (from a current rate of 25 \ per cent and a Dillon Round commitment to move to 22 per cent on 1st July 1968). The Community did not feel able to cut its tariff on heavy commercial vehicles or buses; in the interestsof achieving broad reciprocity in this sector the United Kingdom withdrewits offer on these items.26. Paper. The United Kingdom&apos;s initial offer in the paper sector wasa full 50 per cent reduction across the board subject to reciprocity from the eec. This qualification was essential since the United Kingdom paperindustry already faced substantial imports over a nil tariff from efta countries as well as competition from the e.c. and the United States. Thefinal Community offer in this sector consisted of limited reductions only,and the United Kingdom felt obliged to limit its own offers proportionately.These amounted to an average cut of some 20 per cent leaving the UnitedKingdom tariff somewhat higher than the Common External Tariff in this sector.Implementation of tariff reductions27. Two considerations govern the timetable for the implementation of tariff cuts. In the first place the United States Trade Expansion Act of 1962provides that with certain minor exceptions (tariffs of 5 per cent or below)the reductions to be made in the United States tariff shall be implementedat yearly intervals in five stages. Secondly the Member States of theEuropean Economic Community agreed last year to make their final move to the Common External Tariff on 1st July 1968. What has been agreed in the Kennedy Round is that participants should adopt one of two timetables.The first would provide for implementation of one-fifth of the tariff cuts on1st January 1968 and of the remainder in four further instalments at annual
zintervals finishing on 1st January 1972. The second would provide for implementation of two-fifths of the tariff cuts on 1st July 1968 and of thethree remaining stages on 1st January, 1970, 1971 and 1972. The UnitedStates will follow the first timetable, the European Economic community the second. The United Kingdom will follow the Community&apos;s timing;this is also the intention of the Nordic countries and Switzerland. In ayear&apos;s time, therefore, two-fifths of the tariff reductions agreed in the kennedy round will be brought into effect as far as most intra-European trade isconcerned. Japan also intends to follow the second timetable but the dateof her first tariff cuts may be delayed if their Parliament does not approve the necessary legislation in time.28. The timetables described above relate to minimum obligations, andit would be open to any country (other than the United States which is bound by its legislation) to implement the reductions more quickly (particularlywhen the tariff reduction involved is so small that inconvenient fractionswould result from five stages). In certain cases, where trade is predominantlywith the less developed countries, the reductions may be fully implementedon or before 1st July 1968; (see paragraph 49 below).Simplification of the United Kingdom tariff29. These wide ranging negotiations afforded an opportunity to simplify the United Kingdom tariff. This has grown over the years to be excessivelycomplicated and unwieldy and has been much fragmented by concessions in previous tariff negotiations. The total of some 3,400 tariff headings willbe reduced by over 750; mostly this will be achieved by amalgamatingat a common rate sub-headings which, after the tariff reductions resultingfrom the Kennedy Round, would have had rates only a percentage pointor so apart. In addition the structure of the tariff will in many places beradically simplified and a number of anomalies will be removed. Thenew tariff, which will begin to be introduced in mid-1968, will thus beshorter, simpler and easier for traders to understand and for Customsofficers to administer.(c) Non-tariff barriers to trade30. The main non-tariff barriers, abolition or modification of whichthe United Kingdom sought in the negotiations, were three United Statespractices the American Selling Price system of valuation of certain imports,the American Wine Gallon Assessment system of assessing duty on importsof bottled spirits (whereby excise and import duties are charged on thewater in imported bottled Scotch whisky as though it were 100o proof,thereby charging the added water for duty), and American anti-dumpingpractices.31. As mentioned in paragraphs 17-20 above, the United states administration undertook to seek Congressional authority for the abolitionof the American Selling Price system of valuation for chemicals. Despitelengthy negotiations, it proved impossible to reach agreement with theUnited States on the abolition of wine gallon assessment.32. Discussions took place over some two years on the possibility ofan international code on anti-dumping procedures and practices based onthe principles of Article VI of the GATT in order to secure the full and
more uniform application of these principles by Member countries in theuse of their anti-dumping powers. Agreement was finally reached amongthe major participants on a Code (printed in the Appendix) which will mean that countries subscribing to it must adopt procedures andadministrative practices which will ensure that, when anti-dumpingcomplaints are accepted and examined, trade is not unjustifiably disrupted orinhibited. For example, the Code requires that applications for anti-dumping action must be supported by evidence of material injury to domestic producers as well as of dumping, and that investigations shouldnot be initiated without consideration of the evidence on both these counts.The Code also provides guidance on the assessment of the effects of thedumped imports to ensure that anti-dumping action is only taken againstdumped imports which are demonstrably the principal cause of materialinjury, or the threat of it. (Acceptance of the Code will require theCanadian Government to apply the material injury criterion before imposinganti-dumping duties; under present Canadian legislation, which pre-datesthe GATT (such duties are imposed automatically on imports found to bedumped). The Code limits to three months the period during whichprovisional action can normally be applied in contrast to the indefinite period during which such action is taken under present United States&apos; practice.33. These and other provisions of the Code will involve changes in both United States and Canadian anti-dumping practices, and should providevaluable safeguards to British exporters to these and other markets. TheAgreement will enter into force on 1st. July 1968 for each party whichhas accepted it by that date. It will not be necessary to amend the UnitedKingdom legisation in order to comply with the Code.34. We were unable to meet United States requests for some relaxation in our restrictions on imports of coal and in the limitations applied bythe BBC and the ITA on the use of foreign television material. We agreed,however, to make a reduction by a quarter in the Commonwealth margin of preference on unmanufactured tobacco (see paragraph 21 above) providedthat American Selling Price were abolished; and we also agreed to anextension with effect from this year of the licensing period for fresh grapefruitimported from the Dollar Area to cover the months December to February(the size of the quota was unchanged).(d) Agriculture35. The general objective for the agricultural negotiations set out byGATT Ministers in May 1963 was the creation of acceptable conditions of access to world markets for agricultural products in furtherance of a significant development and expansion of world trade in such products.Agricultural products as defined in the Kennedy Round are very numerousand diverse. The definitions of agricultural products adopted by thevarious participating countries, although not the same, corresponded fairlyclosely with chapters 1-24 of the United Kingdom tariff. They included,therefore, not only basic agricultural commodities such as cereals, meat,dairy products, and eggs, but also all horticultural products, fish, tropicalproducts, all processed and manufactured foodstuffs, beverages, tobacco and very many other products. Methods of support and protection differmarkedly from country to country and from product to product.   For this
reason GATT Ministers decided that for some major commodities cereals,meat and dairy products negotiations should take place in groups with aview to considering whether general arrangements were required or mightbe negotiated. For certain other major commodities, although discussion was not directed specifically to general arrangements, negotiations rangedwider than tariffs. For many processed foodstuffs the negotiations didnot differ much from the negotiations on industrial products, being concernedprincipally with the protection at the frontier.36. In the agricultural sector as defined above the United kingdom is a very large net importer. In 1964 our agricultural imports were worth 1,928 million as compared with agricultural exports of  293 million. our negotiators had well in mind, the import saving role laid down for agricultureand horticulture in the National Plan.37. Cereals. A number of participating countries attached very greatimportance to the conclusion of an agreement on cereals and it is unlikelythat there could have been a successful outcome to the Kennedy Roundwithout such agreement. The main countries participating in the cerealsdiscussions were on the importing side: the e.c.; Japan; and the UnitedKingdom; and on the exporting side: Argentina; Australia; Canada; andthe United States.38.   The three main elements in the negotiations on cereals were:(a) assurances of access to the markets of importing countries,(b) minimum and maximum prices in international trade,(c) contributions to a cereals food aid programme.A marked feature was the similarity of the negotiating positions of theUnited Kingdom and the European Economic Community, and the collaboration between their delegations. The United Kingdom and Japan,however, took the initiative in opposing excessively high minimum and maximum prices in international trade. A number of countries, includingthe United Kingdom and the European Economic Community, were anxious that the agreement should cover both wheat and course grains but it proved impossible to reach agreement on the regulation of prices of coarse grains in international trade. The pricing provisions of the agreement, therefore,relate only to wheat and coarse grains are included in the food aid programme only insofar as they may be suitable for human consumption and acceptable to the recipient countries.39. Lengthy negotiations took place on access to markets and in the later stages discussion centred on the concept of self-sufficiency ratios, i.e.,the ratio of domestic production to domestic consumption of grain in eachof the principal importing countries. It proved impossible, however, toreach agreement on levels of self-sufficiency ratios acceptable to bothimporting and exporting countries, and the attempt to negotiate assurances of access was finally abandoned. The United Kingdom has not thereforeundertaken any commitment on access to its market for cereals. Thedecision not to proceed with the regulation of coarse grain prices was directly related to the abandonment of the negotiation on access. TheUnited Kingdom accepted this on the condition that it would be entitledto maintain its minimum import price system for wheat and coarse grain.
An agreement to this effect between the United Kingdom and the fourprincipal overseas suppliers has been concluded as part of the cerealsnegotiations.40. The exporting countries originally proposed minimum and maximum prices based on US No. 2 Hard Red Winter Ordinary wheat, f.o.b. Gulf ports,which, on the basis of average freight rates in recent years and the qualitydifferentials proposed, represented an increase of 40 US cents per bushel( 5 6s. 8d. per long ton) over the minimum and maximum prices for CanadianManitoba No. 1 wheat laid down in the current International wheat agreement (the price provisions of which expire at the end of July 1967).This proposal was the subject of long and hard bargaining. Agreement wasreached on the basis of a minimum price of 1-73 US dollars per bushel, anda maximum price of 2-13 US dollars per bushel for US No. 2 Hard RedWinter Ordinary, f.o.b. Gulf ports. On the basis of the quality differentialestablished and the freight rates assumed above, the increase in the minimum and maximum prices for Canadian Manitoba No. 1 wheat is estimated at21^ US cents per bushel ( 2 17s. 4d. per long ton). Quality differentials, forwhich no provision is made in the present International Wheat Agreement,have been determined for the more important grades of wheat tradedinternationally. The new agreed minimum prices would, taking account ofthe present freight rates, be above the present level of our minimum import prices by about  2 to  3 per ton in the case of higher quality wheat and byabout  1 per ton for the lower qualities. The new minimum prices are,however, below the level of market prices in the 1966-67 season.41. From the outset of the negotiations the major exporting countriespressed importing countries to accept the principle of a multilateral food aid programme to which all the major participants in the Kennedy Round would contribute. During the later stages of the negotiations, the exporters putforward a specific proposal for an annual programme of 10 million metric tonsof wheat as a contribution to food aid for developing countries. agreement was eventually reached on an annual programme of A\ million metric tons to which the United Kingdom will contribute 5 per cent, Canada 11 per cent,the European Economic Community 23 per cent, and the United States42 per cent. Under this the United Kingdom will provide either grain orcash. If we contribute in cash, the cost will amount to about  5 million per annum. The details of the operation of the food aid programme remain to be negotiated.42. The results of the discussions on cereals have been embodied in amemorandum of agreement reproduced in the Appendix which forms a protocol to the Final Act of the negotiations. The signatories of thememorandum of agreement undertake to negotiate an international grainsarrangement containing the provisions in the memorandum, with the widest possible participation by other countries. The levels of minimum and maximum prices, and of contributions to food aid, are intended to last forthree years and then be subject to renegotiation. The present international wheat Council, in co-operation with UNCTAD, has convened a fullinternational conference to be held in Rome commencing on 12th July 1967to negotiate an international grains arrangement embodying the provisionsof the memorandum of agreement. The date of introduction of the new arrangement remains to be decided.
43. Meat and dairy products. There were lengthy negotiations to explore the possibility of establishing international arrangements for trade inthese commodities, but it did not prove possible to arrive at multilateralagreements.44. Fish. The United Kingdom proposed that, since tariffs are onlyone of a variety of factors influencing international trade in fish, thiscommodity should be discussed in a multilateral group which could also take account of all the other relevant factors affecting access to markets and fishing grounds. However, a number of other countries did not accept thisproposal. Accordingly discussions of fish were generally limited to tariffs and, in the absence of any significant offers by other countries to reduce their non-tariff barriers, the United Kingdom made no changes in its duties onfresh, chilled or frozen fish.45. Other negotiations in the agricultural sector. The United Kingdom&apos;sconcessions in other agricultural negotiations almost all took the form of tariff cuts and these are referred to in paragraph 16 above. these concessions included tariff cuts and the elimination of duties on a numberof tropical products, which are primarily of interest to developing countries(see paragraph 47 below). At the same time the United Kingdom received in the agricultural sector 50 per cent tariff cuts on almost all the products ofinterest to our exporters in the United States market and smaller concessions in the e.c. and Japan.(e) Reductions in barriers to the exports o  the less developed countries46. The United Kingdom faced a difficulty in dealing with the less developed countries in that 12 out of the 29, less developed countries taking part in the Kennedy Round were Commonwealth countries to virtually all of whose products we had long given free entry. Reductions in the UnitedKingdom tariff, while they would help non-Commonwealth less developed countries, would therefore reduce the preferential advantages enjoyed in theUnited Kingdom market by the Commonwealth less developed countries.This made necessary a difficult and delicate balancing of interests.47. There were three main directions in which the United Kingdomsought to help the less developed countries. The first was the extent ofoffers of tariff reductions. The United Kingdom&apos;s initial industrial offer was to reduce tariffs by 50 per cent across 96 per cent of its imports from non-Commonwealth developing countries (quite apart from existing free entry to the Commonwealth, which includes half the free world&apos;s developing countries in terms of population). This offer could not be maintained sincethe lists of exceptions to the linear cut tabled by all our major negotiatingpartners were longer, some of them substantially so, than our own, but in selecting offers for withdrawal we avoided as far as possible items of interestto the less developed countries. The results can be seen from the followingfacts. From the non-Commonwealth less developed countries participating in the Kennedy Round just over half our total imports in 1964 ( 378 million)were industrial commodities; of those over four-fifths (including cotton, wooland copper) were already duty free. On the remaining fifth we are makingtariff reductions, in many cases as deep as 50 per cent on over 75 per cent of the trade; examples are travel goods of leather and plastic, plywood,
veneer sheets, imitation jewellery, furniture, leather and lumber. Of our agricultural imports from these countries ( 181 million in 1964) 18 per centwere duty free. Of the remainder we have agreed to make tariff reductions on some  43 million. In particular the United Kingdom made a considerableeffort on tropical products which are mainly of interest to less developed countries. Clearly the United Kingdom must be concerned that its less developed preferential suppliers find reasonable conditions of accesselsewhere if there is some reduction in their preferences in the UnitedKingdom. This was the reason for our long-standing insistence that thereshould be adequate joint action by the other industrialised countries. action by these countries was not such as to justify us in eliminating all our duties on tropical products. Nevertheless we are making substantial reductions.On cocoa and cocoa products we are eliminating the duties; on raw coffeewe are reducing the duty by 50 per cent. On a number of other productssuch as some tropical fruits and spices we are also either eliminating orreducing our duties. Nevertheless 63 per cent of our total preferential trade from Commonwealth less developed countries participating in the kennedy round ( 205-1 million) is not affected by offers of tariff reductions.48. Second, on some 300 headings in its tariff other than tropicalproducts, many of direct interest to the less developed countries, the UnitedKingdom is offering cuts greater than 50 per cent. Examples include naturalsponges (8 per cent to free), certain hides and skins (10 per cent to free),lead (7s. 6d. per ton to free), hazelnuts (7-J per cent to free), and certainlumber (8s. per standard to free).49. Third, the United Kingdom is prepared, subject to consultations with Commonwealth countries and to similar action by other industrialisedparticipants, to make cuts in advance of the date for the first stages for bringing into effect its tariff concessions in the Kennedy Round (1st July 1968)on certain products of interest to developing countries, in particular ontropical products.50. In addition the less developed countries received concessions, insome cases substantial, from other participants, in particular the UnitedStates, the European Economic Community, Japan and our EFTA partners.Commonwealth preferences51. Commonwealth Trade Ministers at their meeting in May 1963welcomed the Kennedy Round of trade negotiations. Commonwealth PrimeMinisters at their meeting in June 1965 reaffirmed their support of the kennedy Round. Commonwealth Trade Ministers at their meeting in June1966 emphasised the great importance of reaching a settlement in the kennedy Round covering both industrial and agricultural products, and theneed to ensure that the Kennedy Round resulted in increased benefits for allcountries, including developing countries. Commonwealth Trade ministers agreed that there should be consultation as far as was practicable between commonwealth Governments before any concessions were made that would affect the preferential margins enjoyed by Commonwealth partners. they also stressed the care that would have to be taken that those commonwealth countries benefiting from preferential arrangements should so far as possiblegain compensating trade benefits in world markets for any reduction in thevalue of the preferences they have enjoyed.
52. It had been recognised by Commonwealth Governments at the outset of the Kennedy Round that the sweeping reductions in tariffs, whichwere one of the major aims of the negotiating arrangements, would result insome reductions in preferences. This made all the more important the traditional practice in GATT tariff negotiations of consultation between commonwealth Governments before offers of reductions in duty that would entail reductions in margins of preferences. The United KingdomGovernment consulted other Commonwealth Governments before making its initial offers of industrial tariff reductions (November 1964), its initial offers of agricultural concessions (September 1965 and August 1966), and their final offers. The United Kingdom delegation in Geneva maintained close and regular contact throughout the negotiations with the delegations of commonwealth countries represented there. In this way it was possible forthe United Kingdom to take into account the views of other commonwealth governments on proposed concessions that would affect preferences in theBritish market of particular importance to them, and to make its viewsknown about the importance of preferences liable to be affected byconcessions made by those other Commonwealth Governments participating in the Kennedy Round. Among the preferences affected by reductions in tariffs are those provided under trade agreements with other commonwealth preference area Governments. In the case of certain products, for examplemotor cars and textiles made of, or containing, man-made fibres, which arenot admitted free of duty from Commonwealth sources, the preferential ratesof duty will in general be appropriately adjusted so as to maintain theexisting ratios of preference.53. The United Kingdom made no offers of tariff reductions on nearly two-thirds of those of its imports from Australia which enjoy preferenceshere (i.e., other than those which enter duty free from all sources). For herpart tariff reductions which Australia undertook to make affected only 14 million of total Australian imports from the United Kingdom of 304 million in the year 1965-66. The fact that most of our preferentialimports from Canada are industrial ( 133 million in 1964 out of  191 million)meant that cuts in the preferences on these imports were substantial, giventhe wide ranging cuts in industrial tariffs which were one of the majorachievements of the Kennedy Round; nevertheless in some major sectors ofimportance to Canada (plastics and paper) the cuts will be a good deal lessthan 50 per cent and in the case of our agricultural imports from Canadaonly 34 per cent (in 1964) were affected by offers of tariff reductions. Forits part the tariff reductions which Canada undertook to make affected some 133 million of total United Kingdom exports to Canada in 1963 of 173 million not all of which is subject to preference. On a number ofimportant United Kingdom exports to Canada (e.g., certain machinery, cars,carpets and shoes) there was either no reduction of preference or a minorone. In the case of New Zealand cuts in preferences in both directions were extremely small.54. Other Commonwealth countries participating in the Kennedy Round(India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Ghana, Nigeria, Cyprus, Sierra Leone, Jamaica,Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, Malawi and Malta) took part as less developed countries. Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Uganda do notaccord preferences to Britain.   In the case of the other eight countries the19

Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Uganda do notaccord preferences to Britain.   In the case of the other eight countries the19
tariff commitments that they have undertaken affect only  X million ofBritish exports out of a total (in 1964) of  Y million.55. There has also been the closest consultation with the Governmentof the Irish Republic on the effect that concessions made in the kennedy round would have upon the preferences at present enjoyed by each countryin the other&apos;s market. The effect that the concessions made by the irish republic Government have on the preferences enjoyed by Britain is verysmall.Conclusion56. The Kennedy Round will have two main consequences. In the firstplace, there will be substantial reductions in the tariffs faced by UnitedKingdom exporters in the European Economic Community, the United Statesand Japan; these areas take about one-third of British exports; a substantial increase in United Kingdom exports should eventually result. In the second place, the reductions agreed in the United Kingdom tariff over a similarperiod will lead to increased competition in the home market. Britishindustry, in other words, will be faced both with a considerable opportunity and a considerable challenge.57. The Kennedy Round also had significant results in agriculture andon non-tariff barriers. Many concessions will be of assistance to the developing-countries. These results were greater than those achieved in any previous negotiations to reduce the barriers to world trade.

United StatesSUB-PART A.  CHEMICALSArticle 2.   Elimination of American Selling Price System(a) Explanation?. This Article provides for the elimination of theAmerican Selling Price system of valuation (see Sections 402 (e) and 402a (g)of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 USC (1964), 1401a (e) and 1402 (g)) as the basis* As provided in Article 11, this and all other explanations set out in this Agreementhave no legal force or effect whatsoever.
for determining dutiable value in the case of certain chemicals, provided forin Schedule XX (United States), Part I, annexed to the Protocol (hereinafter referred to as Schedule XX), Section 4, Chapter 1. This is accomplished bythe deletion of Notes 4 and 5 from Chapter 1, which provide for use of theAmerican Selling Price system for such articles. In addition, a new Note 4is inserted providing for use of normal methods of valuation therefor (Section402(a) through (d) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 USC (1964) 1401a (a)through (d)).(b) Amendments. Upon the entry into force of this Agreement, ScheduleXX, Section 4, Chapter 1, shall be amended by striking out Notes 4 and 5thereto, and by inserting in lieu thereof:4. The ad valorem rates provided for in this Chapter shall be based uponthe methods of valuation provided for in Section 402 (a) through (d) of theTariff Act of 1930 (19 USC (1964) 1401a (a) through (d)).Article 3.  Substitution ol Converted Concessions(a) Explanation. This Article removes from Schedule XX the ,originalconcessions on chemicals provided for in Units B and C of Chapter 1 ofSection 4, which are based on the American Selling Price system, andreplaces them with the substitute converted concessions, set forth in appendix a, with concession rates based on normal methods of valuation. In addition,this Article removes Note 6 from Chapter 1, Unit C, which provides thatspecific duties on certain dyes shall be based on standards of strength, sincethe substitute converted concessions on these dyes involve only ad valoremrates of duty.(b) Amendments. Upon the entry into force of this Agreement, ScheduleXX, Section 4, Chapter 1, shall be amended by striking out Units B and C(original concessions), and by inserting in lieu thereof Units B and C inAppendix A to this Agreement (substitute converted concessions) whichomit Note 6 of Unit C.Article 4.   Further Tariff Reductions(a) Explanation. This Article provides for the following tariff concessionsby the United States on certain chemicals and other articles, not coveredby Article 3, in return for the concessions provided for herein by the other parties to this Agreement:(i) paragraph (b) (i) of this Article repeals General Note 3 (f) of ScheduleXX, which provides that, in the absence of the additional concessionsby the other parties to this Agreement, the United States will interruptthe staging of concessions on certain chemicals and other articles sothat such concessions do not exceed reductions two fifths of eachreduction to the full concession rate. With respect to such articles,as they are identified by item numbers in Appendix B to thisAgreement, the United States is prepared to make the remaining threefifths of such reduction in return for the additional concessions from the other parties, and(ii) paragraph (b)(ii) of this Article amends Schedule XX by deletingoriginal concessions on certain additional chemicals and other articles
and substituting therefor concessions which provide for fufl oncessionrates, constituting reductions in excess of 50 per cent set forth inAppendix C to this Agreement.(b) Amendments. Upon the entry into force of this Agreement, ScheduleXX shall be amended:(i) by striking out General Note 3 (/); this repeals, as of the effectivedate of this amendment, the provision for interruption of the stagingof the concessions provided for in the items listed in Appendix B;and after such date the effectiveness of such concessions (including any further staging thereof) shall be governed by the provisions ofGeneral Note 3, computing any relevant time periods from the effective date of the original concessions, as though there had been no provision for interruption of staging, and(ii) by striking out the rate in each item in Schedule XX (originalconcession) which has the same item number as an item set forth in Appendix C, and in each case inserting in lieu thereof the rate insuch item in Appendix C (substitute concession exceeding 50 per cent).SUB-PART B.  STAGING OF SUBSTITUTE CONCESSIONSArticle 5.   Co-ordination of Staging(a) Explanation. This Article provides for the staging of the substituteconverted concessions provided for in Appendix A and of the substituteconcessions exceeding 50 per cent provided for in Appendix C. It doesso by inserting a new General Note 3 (/) in Schedule XX and by addinga new Annex I-A to that Schedule. New General Note 3 (/) assimilates thestaging of the substitute concessions with the staging of the originalconcessions for which they are substituted. Although rates will be changedby the amendment, the time periods and relative amounts of reductionin effect on any clay after the entry into force of this amendment will bethe same for the substitute concessions as they would have been for theoriginal concessions. Annex D to this Agreement, which contains thenew Annex I-A to Schedule XX. sets forth, for both kinds of substituteconcessions, rates applicable during the first, second, third, and fourthyears of staging, computed from the date of the original concessions.(b) Amendments. Upon the entry into force of this Agreement,Schedule XX shall be amended:(i) by striking out &apos; paragraphs (c/)(ii) and (/)&apos; in the first sentence ofGeneral Note 3 (a), and by inserting in lieu thereof &apos; paragraphid) (ii)&apos;,(ii) by striking out&apos; In the case of each staged rate,&apos; in General Note 3 (b),and by inserting in lieu thereof:Special provisions regarding rates in Section 4, Chapter 1, Units B andC, and regarding rates followed by three asterisks are set forth inparagraph (/) of this Note.

asterisks, the full concession rate becomes effective on the day on whichSchedule XX is amended to include such rate. In the case of each fullconcession rate in Section 4, Chapter 1, Units B and C, and in thecase of each full concession rate which is followed by three asterisks,the rates applicable during the first, second, third and fourth years ofstaging are set forth in Annex I-A to this Schedule. The first, second,third, and fourth years of staging in that Annex coincide with thecorresponding years of staging of the original concession rates, i.e., theyare computed for each converted rate from the effective date of theoriginal concessions. Consequently, if a rate is inserted in Schedule XXon any day prior to 1 January 1969, the rate which becomes applicableon and after that day is the rate for tir; same stage, under the substituteconcession, as the stage for the rate it replaces under the originalconcession. The rates for the substitute concession applicable duringthe subsequent stages, and the full concession rate therefor, will, as provided under such Annex and under paragraphs (a) (ii) and (d) of this note, become effective on the same day as was provided for such stagesand such full concession rate under the original concession.and,(iv) by inserting Annex I-A, which is contained in Appendix D to thisAgreement, immediately following Annex I of Schedule XX.Part III.

Commercial purchases and supply commitments1. Each member country when exporting wheat undertakes to do so at prices consistent with the price range.2. Each member country importing wheat undertakes that the maximum possible share of its total commercial purchases of wheat in any crop yearshall be purchased from member countries, except as provided in paragraph 4below. This share will have to be determined at a later stage and will be dependant upon the extent to which other countries accede to theArrangement.3. Exporting countries undertake, in association with one another, thatwheat from their countries shall be made available for purchase by importing countries in any crop year at prices consistent with the price range in quantitiessufficient to satisfy on a regular and continuous basis the commercialrequirements of those countries subject to the other provisions of thisAgreement.4. Under extraordinary circumstances a member country may be granted by the Council partial exemption from the commitment contained inparagraph 2 upon submission of satisfactory supporting evidence to theCouncil.5. Each member country when importing wheat from non-member countries shall undertake to do so at prices consistent with the price range.III. Role of maximum prices. The role of maximum prices shall be in general conformity withthat set forth in the International Wheat Agreement of 1962.2. Provision shall be made for continuous review by the Secretariat ofthe Grains Council of the situation with regard to the arrangements inrespect of maximum prices and for initiating the necessary action.3. Durum wheat and certified seed wheat shall be excluded from theprovisions relating to maximum prices.IV. Role of minimum prices the purpose of the schedule of minimum prices is to contribute to marketstability by making it possible to determine when the level of market prices for any wheat is at or approaching the minimum of the range.   Since price
relationships between types and qualities of wheat fluctuate with competitivecircumstances, provision is made for review of and adjustments in minimum prices, on the basis of the following principles:1. If the Secretariat of the Grains Council in the course of itscontinuous review of market conditions is of the opinion that a situation has arisen, or threatens imminently to arise, which appears to jeopardise the objectives of the Arrangement with regard to the minimum price provisions,or if such a situation is called to the attention of the Secretariat of theCouncil by any member country, the Executive Secretary shall convene ameeting of the Prices Review Committee within two days and concurrentlynotify all member countries.2. The Prices Review Committee shall review the price situation withthe view to reaching agreement on action required by member participantsto restore price stability and to maintain prices at or above minimum levels and shall notify the Executive Secretary when agreement has been reached and of the action taken to restore market stability.3. If after three market days the Prices Review Committee is unableto reach agreement on the action to be taken to restore market stability, thechairman of the Council shall convene a meeting of the Council within two days to consider what further measures might be taken. If after not morethan three days of review by the Council any member country is exportingor offering wheat below the minimum prices as determined by the Council,the Council shall decide whether provisions of the agreement shall be suspended and if so to what extent.4. When any minimum price has been adjusted in accordance with theforegoing, such adjustments shall terminate when the Prices review committee or the Council finds that the conditions requiring the adjustmentsno longer prevail.5. Denatured wheat shall be excluded from the provisions relating tominimum prices.V.   International Food aid. The countries party to this Agreement agree to contribute wheat,coarse grains, or the cash equivalent thereof, as aid to the developing countries, to an amount of 4-5 million metric tons of grain annually. Grainscovered by the programme shall be suitable for human consumption and ofan acceptable type and quality.2. The minimum contribution of each country party to this agreement is fixed as follows:Per cent 1,000 metric tonsUnited KingdomSwitzerlandSwedenDenmarkNorwayFinland......Japan   ......Canada ...AustraliaArgentinaEECUnited States ..42-0 1,89011-0 4955-0 2250-5 2323-0 1,0355-0 2250-7 321-2 540-6 270-3 140-3 145-0 225
Countries acceding to the Arrangement may make contributions on such abasis as may be agreed.3. The contribution of a country making the whole or part of its contribution to the programme in the form of cash shall be calculated byevaluating the quantity determined for that country (or that portion of thequantity not contributed in grain) at US$1-73 per bushel.4. Food aid in the form of grain shall be supplied on the following terms:(a) Sales for the currency of the importing country which is nottransferable and is not convertible into currency or goods and services for use by the contributing country. *(b) A gift of grain or a monetary grant used to purchase grain for the importing country.Grain purchases shall be made from participating countries. In the use of grant funds, special regard shall be had to facilitating grain exports of developing member countries. To this end priority shall be given so that not less than 25 per cent of the cash contribution to purchase grain for food aid or that part of such contribution required to purchase 200,000 metric tons of grain shall be used to purchase grains produced in developing countries. Contributions in the form of grains shall be placed in f.o.b.forward position by donor countries.5. Countries party to the Arrangement may, in respect of their contribution to the food aid programme, specify a recipient country orcountries.VI.

ANTI-DUMPING CODEArticle 1The imposition of an anti-dumping duty is a measure to be taken only under the circumstances provided for in Article VI of the General Agreement.The following provisions govern the application of this Article, in so far asaction is taken under anti-dumping legislation or regulations.
A.   Determination of DampingArticle 2(a) For the purpose of this Code a product is to be considered as beingdumped, i.e., introduced into the commerce of another country at less thanits normal value, if the export price of the product exported from one country to another is less than the comparable price, in the ordinary courseof trade, for the like product when destined for consumption in the exporting country.(b) Throughout this Code the term &apos; like product&apos; (&apos; produit similaire&apos;)shall be interpreted to mean a product which is identical, i.e,, alike in all respects to the product under consideration, or in the absence of such aproduct, another product which, although not alike in all respects, hascharacteristics closely resembling those of the product under consideration.(c) In the case where products are not imported directly from thecountry of origin but are exported to the country of importation froman intermediate country, the price at which the products are sold fromthe country of export to the country of importation shall normally be compared with the comparable price in the country of export. However,comparison may be made with the price in the country of origin, if, forexample, the products are merely trans-shipped through the country of export, or such products are not produced in the country of export, or thereis no comparable price for them in the country of export.(d) When there are no sales of the like product in the ordinary courseof trade in the domestic market of the exporting country or when, becauseof the particular market situation, such sales do not permit a propercomparison, the margin of dumping shall be determined by comparisonwith a comparable price of the like product when exported to any thirdcountry which may be the highest such export price but should be arepresentative price, or with the cost of production in the country of origin plus a reasonable amount for administrative, selling and any other costs and for profits. As a general rule, the addition for profit shallnot exceed the profit normally realised on sales of products of the same general category in the domestic market of the country of origin.(e) In cases where there is no export price or where it appears to theauthorities* concerned that the export price is unreliable because of association or compensatory arrangement between the exporter and theimporter or a third party, the export price may be constructed on thebasis of the price at which the imported products are first resold to anindependent buyer, or if. the products are not resold to an independentbuyer, or not resold in the condition as imported, on such reasonablebasis as the authorities may determine.(/) In order to effect a fair comparison between the export price andthe domestic price in the exporting country (or the country of origin)or, if applicable, the price established pursuant to the provisions ofArticle VI: 1 (b) of the General Agreement, the two prices shall be comparedat the same level of trade, normally at the ex factory level, and in respectof sales made at as nearly as possible the same time.   Due allowance* When in this Code the term ^authorities&apos; is used, it shall be interpreted as meaningauthorities at an appropriate, senior level.
shall be made in each case, on its merits, for the differences in conditions and terms of sale, for the differences in taxation, and for the other differencesaffecting price comparability. In the cases referred to in Article 2(e)allowance for costs, including duties and taxes, incurred between importationand resale, and for profits accruing, should also be made.(g) This Article is without prejudice to the second SupplementaryProvision to paragraph 1 of Article VI in Annex I of the General Agreement.B.   Determination of Material Injury, Threat of MaterialInjury and Material RetardationArticle 3Determination of Injury1&quot;(a) A determination of injury shall be made only when the authorities concerned are satisfied that the dumped imports are demonstrably theprincipal cause of material injury or of threat of material injury to a domestic industry or the principal cause of material retardation of theestablishment of such an industry. In reaching their decision the authoritiesshall weigh, on one hand, the effect of the dumping and, on the other hand,all other factors taken together which may be adversely affecting theindustry. The determination shall in all cases be based on positive findingsand not on mere allegations or hypothetical possibilities. In the case ofretarding the establishment of a new industry in the country of importation,convincing evidence on the forthcoming establishment of an industry mustbe shown, for example that the plans for a new industry have reached a fairly advanced stage, a factory is being constructed or machinery hasbeen ordered.(b) The evaluation of injury that is the evaluation of the effects of thedumped imports on the industry in question shall be based on examinationof all factors having a bearing on the state of the,, industry in question,such as: development and prospects with regard to turnover, marketshare, profits, prices (including the extent to which the delivered, duty-paid price is lower or higher than the comparable price for the like productprevailing in the course of normal commercial transactions in the importingcountry), export performance, employment, volume of dumped and otherimports, utilisation of capacity of domestic industry, and productivity; and restrictive trade practices. No one or several of these factors can necessarilygive decisive guidance.(c) In order to establish whether dumped imports have caused injuryall other factors which, individually or in combination, may be adverselyaffecting the industry shall be examined, for example: the volume and prices of undumped imports of the product in question, competition betweenthe domestic producers themselves, contraction in demand due to substitution of other products or to changes in consumer tastes.* When in this Code the term injury&apos; is used, it shall, unless otherwise specified,be interpreted as covering cause of material injury to a domestic industry, threat ofmaterial injury to a domestic industry or material retardation of the establishmentof such an industry.
(d) The effect of the dumped imports shall be assessed in relation to the domestic production of the like product when available data permit the separate identification of production in terms of such criteria as: theproduction process, the producers&apos; realisations, profits. When the domestic production of the like product has no separate identity in these terms theeffect of the dumped imports shall be assessed by the examination of theproduction of the narrowest group or range of products, which includes the like product, for which the necessary information can be provided.(e) A determination of threat of material injury shall be based on facts and not merely on allegation, conjecture or remote possibility. The changein circumstances which would create a situation in which the dumping would cause material injury must be clearly foreseen and imminent.*(/) With respect to cases where material injury is threatened by dumpedimports, the application of anti-dumping measures shall be studied and decided with special care.Article 4Definition of Industry(a) In determining injury the term &apos; domestic industry &apos; shall be interpreted as referring to the domestic producers as a whole of the like products or tothose of them whose collective output of the products constitutes a majorproportion of the total domestic production of those products except that:(i) when producers are importers of the allegedly dumped product theindustry may be interpreted as referring to the rest of the producers;(ii) in exceptional circumstances a country may, for the production inquestion, be divided into two or more competitive markets and the producers within each market regarded as a separate industry, if,because of transport costs, all the producers within such a marketsell all or almost all of their production of the product in question in that market, and none, or almost none, of the product in questionproduced elsewhere in the country is sold in that market, or if thereexist special regional marketing conditions (for example, traditionalpatterns of distribution or consumer tastes) which result in an equaldegree of isolation of the producers in such a market from the restof the industry, provided, however, that injury may be found in such circumstances only if there is injury to all or almost all of the total production of the product in the market as defined.(b) Where two or more countries have reached such a level of integrationthat they have the characteristics of a single, unified market, the industryin the entire area of integration shall be taken to be the industry referredto in Article 4 (a).(c) The provisions of Article 3 (d) shall be applicable to this Article.* One example, though not an exclusive one, is that there is convincing reasonto believe that there will be, in the immediate future, substantially increasedimportations of the product at dumped prices.
C.  Investigation and Administration ProceduresArticle 5Initiation and Subsequent Investigation(a) Investigations shall normally be initiated upon a request on behalf ofthe industry * affected, supported by evidence both of dumping and of injuryresulting therefrom for this industry. If in special circumstances theauthorities concerned decide to initiate an investigation without havingreceived such a request, they shall proceed only if they have evidence bothon dumping and on injury resulting therefrom.(b) Upon initiation of an investigation and thereafter, the evidence ofboth dumping and injury should be considered simultaneously. In any event the evidence of both dumping and injury shall be consideredsimultaneously in the decision whether or not to initiate an investigation,and thereafter, during the course of the investigation, starting on a date not later than the earliest date on which provisional measures may be applied,except in the cases provided for in Article 10 (d) in which the authoritiesaccept the request of the exporter and the importer.(c) An application shall be rejected and an investigation shall be terminated promptly as soon as the authorities concerned are satisfied thatthere is not sufficient evidence of either dumping or of injury to justifyproceeding with the case. There should be immediate termination in caseswhere the margin of dumping or the volume of dumped imports, actual orpotential, or the injury is negligible.(d) An anti-dumping proceeding shall not hinder the procedures of customs clearance.Article 6Evidence(a) The foreign suppliers and all other interested parties shall be givenample opportunity to present in writing all evidence that they consider useful in respect to the anti-dumping investigation in question. They shall also have the right, on justification, to present evidence orally.(b) The authorities concerned shall provide opportunities for the complainant and the importers and exporters known to be concerned andthe governments of the exporting countries, to see all information that is relevant to the presentation of their cases, that is not confidential as defined in paragraph (c) below, and that is used by the authorities in an anti-dumpinginvestigation, and to prepare presentations on the basis of this information.(c) All information which is by nature confidential (for example, becauseits disclosure would be of significant competitive advantage to a competitoror because its disclosure would have a significantly adverse effect upon aperson supplying the information or upon a person from whom he acquiredthe information) or which is provided on a confidential basis by parties toan anti-dumping investigation shall be treated as strictly confidential by theauthorities concerned who shall not reveal it, without specific permission of the party submitting such information.
id) However, if the authorities concerned find&quot; that a request forconfidentiality is not warranted and if the supplier is either unwilling tomake the information public or to authorise its disclosure in generalised orsummary form, the authorities would be free to disregard such informationunless it can be demonstrated to their satisfaction from appropriate sourcesthat the information is correct.ie) In order to verify information provided or to obtain further detailsthe authorities may carry out investigations in other countries as required,provided they obtain the agreement of the firms concerned and provided they notify the representatives of the government of the country in question and unless the latter object to the investigation.(/) Once the competent authorities are satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to justify initiating an anti-dumping investigation pursuant to article 5 representatives of the exporting country and the exporters andimporters known to be concerned shall be notified and a public notice maybe published.ig) Throughout the anti-dumping investigation all parties shall have afull opportunity for the defence of their interests. To this end, theauthorities concerned shall, on request, provide opportunities for all directly interested parties to meet those parties with adverse interests, so that opposingviews may be presented and rebuttal arguments offered. Provision of suchopportunities must take account of the need to preserve confidentiality andof the convenience to the parties. There shall be no obligation on any partyto attend a meeting and failure to do so shall not be prejudicial to that party&apos;s case.(7z) The authorities concerned shall notify representatives of the exporting country and the directly interested parties of their decisions regardingimposition or non-imposition of anti-dumping duties, indicating the reasonsfor such decisions and the criteria applied, and shall, unless there are special reasons against doing so, make public the decisions.(0 The provisions of this Article shall not preclude the authorities from reaching preliminary determinations, affirmative or negative, or fromapplying provisional measures expeditiously. In cases in which anyinterested party withholds the necessary information, a final finding,affirmative or negative, may be made on the basis of the facts available.Article 7-   &quot;    &apos;:   - &quot;       :v&quot;: *&apos;   &quot; - .7 - .77 ,7 V 77 7; 7 7 7;;77-.; 77;4 .&quot;7 7.7 V;-   &apos;. - 77 77    ivPrice Undertakings.id) Anti-dumping proceedings may be terminated without imposition of anti-dumping duties or provisional measures upon receipt of a voluntaryundertaking by the exporters to revise their prices so that the margin ofdumping is eliminated or to cease to export to the area in question atdumped prices if the authorities concerned consider this practicable, e.g., ifthe number of exporters or potential exporters of the product in question isnot too great and /or if the trading practices are suitable.ib) If the exporters concerned undertake during the examination of acase, to revise prices or to cease to export the product in question, and theauthorities concerned accept the undertaking, the investigation of injury shall
nevertheless be completed if the exporters so desire or the authorities concerned so decide. If a determination of no injury is made, theundertaking given by the exporters shall automatically lapse unless the exporters state that it shall not lapse. The fact that exporters do not offer to give such undertakings during the period of investigation, or do not accept an invitation made by the investigating authorities to do so, shall in no waybe prejudicial to the consideration of the case. However, the authorities areof course free to determine that a threat of injury is more likely to berealised if the dumped imports continue.D. Anti-damping Duties and Provisional MeasuresArticle 8Imposition and Collection of Anti-damping Duties(a) The decision whether or not to impose an anti-dumping duty in caseswhere all requirements for the imposition have been fulfilled and the decision whether the amount of the anti-dumping duty to be imposed shall be the fullmargin of dumping or less, are decisions to be made by the authorities of the importing country or customs territory. It is desirable that the imposition hepermissive in all countries or customs territories parties to this Agreement,and that the duty be less than the margin, if such lesser duty would be adequate to remove the injury to the domestic industry.(b) When an anti-dumping duty is imposed in respect of any product, suchanti-dumping duty shall be levied, in the appropriate amounts in each case,on a non-discriminatory basis on imports of such product from all sourcesfound to be dumped and causing injury. The authorities shall name thesupplier or suppliers of the product concerned. If, however, severalsuppliers from the same country are involved, and it is impracticable, to nameall these suppliers, the authorities may name the supplying country concerned.If several suppliers from more than one country are involved, the authorities may name either all the suppliers involved, or, if this is impracticable, allthe supplying countries involved.(c) The amount of the anti-dumping duty must not exceed the margin ofdumping as established under Article 2. Therefore, if subsequent to theapplication of the anti-dumping duty it is found that the duty so collectedexceeds the actual dumping margin, the amount in excess of the margin shallbe reimbursed as quickly as possible.(d) Within a basic price system the following rules shall apply providedthat their application is consistent with the other provisions of this Code:If several suppliers from one or more countries are involved,anti-dumping duties may be imposed on imports of the product in questionfound to have been dumped and to be causing injury from the country orcountries concerned, the duty being equivalent to the amount by whichthe export price is less than the basic price established for this purpose,not exceeding the lowest normal price in the supplying country orcountries where normal conditions of competition are prevailing. It isunderstood that for products which are sold below this already established
basic price a new anti-dumping investigation shall be carried out in each particular case, when so demanded by the interested parties and thedemand is supported by relevant evidence. In cases where no dumpingis found anti-dumping duties collected shall be reimbursed as quickly aspossible. Furthermore, if it can be found that the duty so collectedexceeds the actual dumping margin, the amount in excess of the marginshall be reimbursed as quickly as possible.(e) When the industry has been interpreted as referring to the producers in a certain area i.e., a market as defined in Article 4 (a) (ii), anti-dumping duties shall only be definitively collected on the products in question consignedfor final consumption to that area, except in cases where the exporter shall,prior to to the imposition of anti-dumping duties, be given an opportunity to cease dumping in the area concerned. In such cases, if an adequateassurance to this effect is promptly given, anti-dumping duties shall not be imposed, provided, however, that if the assurance is not given or is notfulfilled, the duties may be imposed without limitation to an area.Article 9Duration of Anti-dumping Duties(a) An anti-dumping duty shall remain in force only as long as it isnecessary in order to counteract dumping which is causing injury.(b) The authorities concerned shall review the need for the continuedimposition of the duty, where warranted, on their own initiative or if interestedsuppliers or importers of the product so request and submit informationsubstantiating the need for review.Article 10Provisional Measures(a) Provisional measures may be taken only when a preliminary decision has been taken that there is dumping and when there is sufficient evidenceof injury.(b) Provisional measures may take the form of a provisional duty or,preferably, a security by deposit or bond equal to the amount of the anti-dumping duty provisionally estimated, being not greater than theprovisionally estimated margin of dumping. Withholding of appraisement isan appropriate provisional measure provided that the normal duty and theestimated amount of the anti-dumping duty be indicated and as long as the withholding of appraisement is subject to the same conditions as otherprovisional measures.(c) The authorities concerned shall inform representatives of the exporting country and the directly interested parties of their decisions regardingimposition of provisional measures indicating the reasons for such decisions and the criteria applied, and shall, unless there are special reasons againstdoing so, make public such decisions.(d) The imposition of provisional measures shall be limited to as short aperiod as possible.  More specifically, provisional measures shall not be
imposed for a period longer than three months or, on decision of theauthorities concerned upon request by the exporter and the importer, sixmonths.(e) The relevant provisions of Article 8 shall be followed in theapplication of provisional measures.Article 11RetroactiviryAnti-dumping duties and provisional measures shall only be applied toproducts which enter for consumption after the time when the decision taken under Articles 8 (a) and 10 (a), respectively, enters into force, except that incases:(i) Where a determination of material injury (but not of a threat ofmaterial injury, or of a material retardation of the establishment ofan industry) is made or where the provisional measures consistof provisional duties and the dumped imports carried out duringthe period of their application would, in the absence of theseprovisional measures, have caused material injury, anti-dumping duties may be levied retroactively for the period for whichprovisional measures, if any, have been applied.If the anti-dumping duty fixed in the final decision is higher thanthe provisionally paid duty, the difference shall not be collected. Ifthe duty fixed in the final decision is lower than the provisionallypaid duty or the amount estimated for the purpose of the security,the difference shall be reimbursed or the duty recalculated, as thecase may be.(ii) Where appraisement is suspended for the product in question for reasons which arose before the initiation of the dumping case andwhich are unrelated to the question of dumping, retroactiveassessment of anti-dumping duties may extend back to a period notmore than 120 days before the submission of the complaint.(iii) Where for the dumped product in question the authorities determine(a) either that there is a history of dumping which caused materialinjury or that the importer was, or should have been, aware that the exporter practises dumping and that such dumpingwould cause material injury, and(b) that the material injury is caused by sporadic dumping(massive dumped imports of a product in a relatively short period) to such an extent that, in order to preclude it recurring,it appears necessary to assess an anti-dumping duty retroactivelyon those imports,the duty may be assessed on products which were entered forconsumption not more than 90 days prior to the date of applicationof provisional measures.
E.   And-Dumping Action on Behalf of a Third CountryArticle 12(a) An application for anti-dumping action on behalf of a third country shall be made by the authorities of the third country requesting action.(b) Such an application shall be supported by price information to showthat the imports are being dumped and by detailed information to showthat the alleged dumping is causing injury to the domestic industry concernedin the third country. The government of the third country shall afford allassistance to the authorities of the importing country to obtain any furtherinformation which the latter may require.(c) The authorities of the importing country in considering such anapplication shall consider the effects of the alleged dumping on the industry concerned as a whole in the third country; that is to say the injury shall notbe assessed in relation only to the effect of the alleged dumping on theindustry&apos;s exports to the importing country or even on the industry&apos;s total exports.(d) The decision whether or not to proceed with a case shall rest withthe importing country. If the importing country decides that it is preparedto take action, the initiation of the approach to the Contracting Partiesseeking their approval for such action shall rest with the importing country.PART II.
