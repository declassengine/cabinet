C(67) 104 COPY NO. 6 j21st June, 1967CABINETPUBLIC expenditure memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerLast January the Cabinet instructed officials to carry out theannual public expenditure review so as to give effect to the generalstrategy which was then put forward, and to provide us v/ith a reviewof expenditure programmes which would enable our existing prioritiesto be reassessed.     The results are contained in two documents -(a) &quot;Public Expenditure:  Areas of Choice&quot; (C(67) 102)(b) &quot;Public Expenditure:   Continuation of Existing Policies&quot; (C(67) 103)We also have the revised Medium Term Assessment,  &quot;The EconomicOutlook to 1972&quot; (C(67) 108), so we have the background material toenable us to review the prospect for expenditure.    I suggest v/e should concentrate on the period up to 1970-71.2.       The public expenditure programmes based on the continuation ofexisting policies were, broadly speaking, geared to growth of the gross domestic Product (GDP) at 4 per cent a year between 1964 and 1970.    Thenew Medium Term Assessment gives us a firmer foundation as a starting point, namely, the &quot;trend rate of growth of productivity&quot;.    Roughly thismeans the GDP grows at 3 per cent a year:  unemployment declines from  per cent to 1.75 per cent and modest balance of payments surpluses areearned.3.       We have three alternatives from which to choose:-(i)  We can let public expenditure go ahead so as to continue existing policies.     This is the &quot;higher public expenditure&quot; shown in paragraph 82of the Medium Term Assessment.     To adopt this course would involvea severe check to the growth of personal consumption per head, whichwould have to be restrained so that it did not increase by an annual average of more than 10 6 per cent between 1967 and 1970 (Table IV-4in the Medium Term Assessment).     This is well below the rate of increase over the ten years 1957 to 1966, i0 e. 2. 3 per cent.     To holddown consumption to 1. 6 per cent would call for a large increase in revenue, roughly  3,600 million in all (allowing also for a big increasein the surpluses of the nationalised industries).    This would raise theproportion of Gross National Product (GNP) taken in tax from 34. 6 percent in 1965 to 41 per cent in 1970 (it is 38 per cent in 1967),    If we keptthe tax burden roughly constant at 38 per cent of the GNP while the GNPis growing, v/e should obtain  2, 300 million of additional revenue fromIvlENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY rS GOVERNMENT)
central government taxes, local authority rates and social securitycontributions.    The difference of  1, 300 million would represent anincrease in the burden of taxation of which the greater part would haveto corne from increases in the actual rates of tax etc. leviedc(ii)   The second alternative is to cut back the increase in public expenditure by the  714 million (an addition would be needed for the revised uprating of social security benefits) implied in the &quot;lowerpublic expenditure&quot; alternative put forward-in paragraph 82 of the medium Term Assessment.     (This cut is equivalent to the  500 million suggested last January, the increase being due mainly to recostings andnew additions).    This would dislocate our objective of improving the public services.(iii)   Thirdly, v/e can try to find an intermediate course,,    I believe wecan do this.    It would be possible to maintain a considerable momentumin public expenditure and at the same time to allow the personal standardof life to be improved.    If we were to moderate the expenditure increaseso that 1970-71 is reduced by  500 million, then private consumption per head would increase by 2, 2 per cent per year, i. e. at roughly the levelof the last decade, provided that the great bulk of the reduction fell upongoods and services.     This would mean that public expenditure would increase from its 1966-67 level of  13,038 million to  15,141 million in 1970-71 instead of the present expected level of  15, 641 million.In this way we should be able to continue the improvement anddevelopment of the standard of collective consumption for the benefitof the whole community;  at the same time v/e should enable the ordinarycitizen to feel a sense of reasonable well-being in the progressiveimprovement of his personal standard of lifee,4.       If we work on a basis of  15,141 million public expenditurein 1970-71 this will be  1,120 million higher (at constant prices) thanin 1967-68 (see Note 6),    In so far as v/e moderate increases ofexpenditure on goods and services, resources will be&quot; availableto improve the rate of growth in private consumption per heacl0Reductions in transfer expenditure, accompanied by correspondingreductions in taxation, will leave private consumption per head largelyunaffected.    Given the limits within v/hich we can raise taxation, this does not mean that we should be indifferent to the possibility ofeconomising on transfer expenditure.    What is true, as the paper on &quot;The Economic Implications of Public Expenditure&quot;(C(67) 105)shows, is that the tax requirement is more if any given sum is spent by the Government on goods and services than if the samesum is spent on transfer expenditure,,    If f:100 million is spenton housing, roads, or schools, the increased tax needed to offset the impact on demand is greater than this;   on the other hand, for social security payments the amount needed would be rather lessthan  100 million.5,       The proposed new ceiling of  15,141 million would, if the calculations come out as forecast.- enable us to return to a rate of growth of personal consumption per head rising at 2^ 2 per cent a year.There would be a significant rise in the total tax burden as a percentageof GNP, from 38 per cent in 1967 to about 40 per cent;  it would still bepossible for us to increase the rates of tax further in order to raise social security benefits.    Even if central government tax rates were maintainedSECRET
unchanged,  the real value of personal tax allowances would bedecreasing if they were kept at their present money level (as the calculations assume) despite the rise in prices.     The calculationsalso assume that there will be a substantial increase in localauthority rate poundages and in social security contributions.    Ofcourse, if the cyclical recovery of demand went   further and faster than is now expected, some increase in tax rates would become inevitable.     This is an additional reason for caution on expenditure.Areas for Examination6.      I now suggest the areas on which we should concentrate our attention in working out the new ceiling cf expenditure.7.     Defence.    It is clear that we must look to savings on defence expenditure for the biggest single contribution.    We should aim to save at least  200 million here, though this will be offset to someextent by additional expenditure on aid (perhaps as much as 25-30 million a year) and on transitional payments on defenceVotes arising from the run-down (perhaps  10-15 million a year)which will be necessary in order to secure the savings on defence.8.      Civil Expenditure (mainly goods and services)(a) TransportExpenditure on the transport sector, including roads, isestimated to rise from  800 million in 1967-68 to 970 million in 1970-71,    There are also proposals for new expenditure of about  5 0 million a year by 1970-71which are not provided for in these figures.     (they include grants for urban development, bus subsidies,and expenditure on safety and research).    Cabinet PapersC(67) 101 and 102 set out the effects of a l\ per cent reduction in expenditure which would save   20 million in1968-69, rising to  54 million in 1970-71.    We should consider whether the present programme is to beregarded as sacrosanct and also whether proposed new expenditure of  5 0 million should be added on withoutcountervailing savings.    By omitting Scotland and Walesfrom the l\ per cent reduction, a net saving of  46 million could be achieved in 1970-71.    Is it possible to do morewith the railways and to reduce the railway deficit of  130 million per annum ?(b) HousingA complicating factor here is that the Government has accepted that new houses should be built to improvedspace and heating standards, and the basic costs onwhich we worked last year have therefore been increasedby a net  45 million.     Our Public Sector housing programme has increased substantially since we came into office.    In 1964, 185,000 houses were started inthe United Kingdom, and by 1970, on present programmes,242, 000 will be started.    If the extra cost of the secret
improved standards is accepted as inevitable, areduction of l\ per cent would mean that about220,000 houses were started in the United kingdom in 197 0.    These would result in a saving of 86 million.    For purposes of comparison, areduction of Z\ per cent would result in 234, 000 housesbeing started in 1970, and a saving of  29 million.A reduction of 5 per cent would result in 226,000houses started in 1970 and a saving of  57 million.(c)    EducationA reduction of l\ per cent (or a little more) would yieldsavings of   164 million by 1970-71.     The item in whichbig savings could be made ia the postponement of the raising of the school leaving age.     Postponement by4 years in England and Wales and 2 years in scotland would save  46 million.     Other items which couldyield large savings are school meals and milk, andsignificant savings couM be made on universityexpenditure.      A substantial factor on the othei sideis that acceptance of the recommendations in the plowden Report for better school provision in sociallyhandicapped areas etc. would cost an additional 5 0 million in 1970-71.(d)    HealthA very large proportion 01 current expenditure (about 70 percent) on hospitals and local authority health services is onstaff.     The total staff is expected to increase by 90,000,from 770,000 in 1967-60 to 860,000 in 1970-71.    Can somesteps be taken to moderate this very rapid rate of demand on the available manpower resources?    The main choicesfor any reductions in expenditure lie in slowing down newhospital building (which would also reduce staff require-ments) and imposing charges for services.(e)    Other expenditure(i)      Local authority expenditure on environmental services is forecast to rise substantially.This will need to be considered.     The othermain items are set out in the paper C(67) 102&quot;Areas of Choice&quot;.     They include Home office services, Ministry of Technology (aircraft) etc.(ii)      There are also numerous smaller heads ofexpenditure;  we shall need to decide whetherofficials should examine them in the light of thedecisions we ultimately reach on major blocks of expenditure.S EC RET
9*     Social Security.    The reductions of expenditure needed to keepconsumption per head rising at roughly the rate of the last decade willbe achieved very largely through reductions in expenditure on goods and services.    Apart from that, as I said in paragraph 5, it is opento us to adjust taxation in order to re-distribute income.     How far wego in this direction depends on our judgment of the tolerable amount ofthe total increase in taxes, local authority rates and social securitycontributions taken together.    A &quot;give-and-take&quot; family endowmentscheme, for example, means reducing tax allowances instead of following the normal course of raising them to offset the fact that theyhave been eroded by price rises in recent years.    We need to take account of this aspect as well in considering the tolerable amount ofthe increase in taxes etc.    It is against this background that we haveto consider the future level of social security benefits, now that thetotal outlay is so large.    An uprating in 1969 that was in line with pricesrather than earnings would reduce public expenditure by  137 million.Anything between the two (i. e. prices and earnings) would help to providefor the improvement in family endowment and contribute to limit the associated increase in taxation,1968^69 Jjnjoact^10.     In the coming year 1968-69 there will be a rapid prospectiverate of increase in expenditure.    The financing problem is likely tobe serious.     Therefore there will be an advantage in having a strongbias, in making downward adjustments, towards choosing items which can be put into effect quickly.    Most of the items discussed inthis paper are expenditure in the strict sense.     The civil reviews do,however, show the estimated effect of reduced demand for servicesresulting from possible increases in charges.    Measures in this field can be put into effect relatively quickly.1971-7211.     The final year of the public expenditure Survey and the civilreviews is 1971-7 2, this being the fifth year of the Survey period.But it avoids unnecessary    complications if we concentrate attentionon 1970-71, for which we fixed a provisional target in January, while at the same time having regard to its impact on the earlier yearsand looking forward to 1971-72.12.     A view of 1971-72 will be needed for any Plan document whichmay be published, as this will have 1972 as its terminal year.    Itwill also, and perhaps more importantly, be needed for some of the longer-lead expenditure programmes and as a basis for rollingforward the Survey next year.    An assumption will have to be made that there will be a reasonable progression of expenditure from1970-71 to 1971-72.     The most sensible assumption would seem tobe that expenditure in 1971-72 on each programme will exceed thatin 1970-71 by a percentage no greater than the annual average increase between 1967-68 and 1970-71 derived from whatever figureswe agree for 1970-71.    (In some cases, where expenditure has been rising fast up to 1970-71    a lower rate of increase may be appropriate thereafter. )    It may be that we shall have to leave the precise figures for 1971-72 to be agreed between the Treasury andthe spending Departments concerned in the light of aur discussions on 1970-71.
C onclusi or^13.     For the purpose of our discussion my colleagues will find It most helpful to concentrate on the Public Expenditure paper&quot;Areas of Choice&quot; (C(67) 102).     They will see that I have not included all the options open to us for curtailing the rate of increasein expenditure.    But I suggest that in the first place we need ageneral discussion on our expenditure priorities and in what way theyshould be re-assessed.    From that we can pass to examining howreductions are to be made.      I suggest we concentrate on biggerblocks of expenditure.    From such a discussion it will be poss ible todraw up detailed proposals for consideration.    I have contentedmyself at this stage by stating the alternatives that are open and(except in the case of defence savings) have not put forward my own views.    But I must make clear that if private investment and consumption pick up in 1968-69 as I expect, then we shall needsubstantial savings on public expenditure if we are to avoid over-heating the economy.     The alternative course will be large taxincreases in the next Budget, or the one after.14.     I ask my colleages -(a) to agree that we should aim at an increase in personal consumption per head of 2. 2 per cent as an annual average;(b) that we should aim at an increase in total public expenditure in 1970-71 of   1,120 million, thus moderatingour present plans by  5 00 million which should be verylargely found from goods and services;(c) to indicate their views on the areas of expenditure inwhich we should look for the saving of   5 00 million.1*.

But the trend is clear:expenditure tends to come out (quite apart from price changes)substantially higher than a forecast made several years previously.This will be offset in part by improvements in the system of considering and controlling expenditure; nonetheless, some danger ofover-shooting remains.   An explicit contingency allowance of 250 million is being made for 1970-71; but there is a distinctpossibility it will be exceeded and it is necessary to take account ofthis.Rote 4.The January forecasts compared with, the new forecasts of exrjenditureTotal expenditure now forecast   for 1970-71 is some 215 million higher at constant prices than we were assuming in January,as a result of recosting policies, new decisions and further proposals approved in principle by Ministers.
