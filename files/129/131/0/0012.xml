C(67) 112 COPY NO.28th June, 1967CABINE TTHE ARAB OIL. SITUATION: RUSSIAN OIL. AND OTHER ASPECTSMemorandum by the Minister of power the Cabinet invited me on 20th June (CC(67) 40th Conclusions,Minute 2), to review the pros and cons of Russial oil supplies.    Anumber of longer-term factors arise from this, and I comment on thesealso.I.   RUSSIAN OIL,Present policy .       The existing embargo is virtually limited to crude oil and majorproducts - some minor products such as lubricating base oils have long been imported.    It was imposed in 1959 because with our overseas oilinterests there was no overall advantage to our balance of payments inadmitting Russian oil.    Later, increasing importance was attached tothe protection afforded by the ba.n to the coal industry.     The oil industryin the United Kingdom, having its own crude oil, was not prepared to takeRussian crude oil, and it was not thought right to force this oil upon thern.If therefore the Russians were to have a quota, this had to be for refined products.    The product most readily marketable in the United kingdom was fuel oil, which would have added to the problems of the national coal Board.3.      Since then, apprehension about the implications for our oil interestsand for our coal industry has diminished.    It appeared desirable however to await a Russian initiative before reviewing the embargo, in order the better to secure some counter advantage.    In the trade talks so far thisyear the Russians have made no proposal to-send us any of their oil.Possible Advantages of Russian Oil4.       In present circuniftances there may be advantage in securingRussian oil supplies for a number of reasons:(a) To help in the immediate supply situation.(b) For balance of payments reasons, if Russian oil proves cheaperthan other sources.(c) For political reasons, having regard to their stance in the arab world.In considering these points it is important to distinguish between theimmediate situation and the long term.-1-SECRETIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
5.       In the very short term the Russians probably do not want to sellus oil.     The recent statement by Mr. Patolichev, Soviet Minister ofForeign Trade, appears to confirm this.     There would be too great a danger of damage to their image in the Middle East.    The broadjudgment of experts, moreover, is that they probably do not have much oil, if any, to spare.     There is evidence however that someRussian oil might nevertheless be offered, perhaps through brokers.This would be helpful immediately.     The underlying problem in the oilsituation is a shortage of tankers, and the Black Sea ports are a shorterhaul than the other sources we have open.Balance of Payments6.       The extent to v/hich this would help the balance of payments isdubious,    Russian prices vary according to the country of destination,and they or their agents can be expected to charge what the market herecan bear, aligning their prices with Western oil landed in the UnitedKingdom from the Caribbean or from the Persian Gulf after the longhaul round the Cape.    In that event, the balance of payments cost ofRussian oil would be higher than the average balance of payments costof oil from Venezuela or the Persian Gulf where British-owned production is available to us at a cost in foreign exchange well below the price of the oil,    Russian refined products would be less advantageous still to thebalance of payments, compared v/ith our own refined here, since thecost of refining would be in foreign exchange.     It is possible that itwould be cheaper than oil from the United States of America, but all this can be tested by further enquiry.Short Term:  conclusion,       It does not seem likely that the Russians will be offering oil supplies to the United Kingdom at the present time.    It may nevertheless be possible to obtain some supplies of Russian oil;  particularly products,through brokers.     This could be helpful in the present supply situationand I intend to encourage firms such as ICI who are short of products to pursue their enquiries for Russian supplies on the understanding thatthey will be granted an import licence if supplies are forthcoming.    Itis I think important to avoid publicity on this in order to avoid the Russiansclamping down completely on all supplies, direct or indirect, to theUnited Kingdom.    It seems hardly conceivable that bulk supplies ofRussian crude or fuel oil will be offered in the present situation andI regard this primarily as a long-term question In consideringdiversification of supplies.    If however we were able to lay our hands on substantial quantities of crude or fuel oil it might be possibleto buy it for Government stocks and I shall v/atch this possibility closely.The present emergency however is mainly a transport crisis and Russianoil (apart from certain products in short supply) would only be of valueif it could be obtained as an addition to the supplies expected, by increasingthe tanker carrying capacity.
II.   LONGER-TERM OIL policy,       ViThether to admit Russian oil in the long term should, I propose,be examined along with other long-term measures that may improve thesecurity of our oil supplies.     The Foreign Secretary in a recent minutehas proposed that we should reduce the dependence of the economy on oil from whatever source,    I will shortly be circulating to the ministerial committee on Economic Policy (EN) the outcome of my fuel policy review,in the course of which questions of the security and the cost of oil suppliesas these bear on internal energy policy have been thoroughly examined,,I will not anticipate the discussion in the EN Committee but very broadlyI believe that present events will not require further discrimination against the use of oil.    We will need to examine closely however what can be done in the field of oil policies to give ourselves the greatestpractical protection against instability in the Middle East and short-terminterruptions,9.       I have accordingly asked my Department, in consultation with otherDepartments concerned, to examine as a matter of urgency the whole range of possibilities in this field, including:-(a) The holding of greater stocks in this country.    This raises theproblem of finance and perhaps legislation.(b) Further diversification of sources of supply.     This involves an examination of possible sources and of incentives to the oil industry to pursue wider exploration.(c) The desirability of increasing tanker fleets, especially for useround the Cape.10,       Work has begun as a result of this directive, but any gain in prospect as a result will of course be long-term, not immediate,Russian oil would feature under (b).     The long-term aspects ofRussian oil would include the matters I reviewed above in respectof the short term * how much oil they might have to sell:  the balanceor payments:  implications in the Middle East:  outlets in the UnitedKingdom,     The study would of course also have to take account of our general trade policies, II.   OUR STAKE IN OIL11,       In considering the implications of the Middle East situation, wemust not forget the size of our economic stake in oil,    We are concernednaturally, both in the short and long term, over the reliability of oilsupply to this country.    But in all these problems the benefit from ourinvestments in Middle East oil is a major factor.    BP with a 48 per centGovernment shareholding, is the leading oil company in the Middle East;its rights to proved crude oil in the ground are equal to the provedreserves of North and South America put together.    The Shell Groupalso has wide interests in the Middle East, and both companies havesupplies in Libya.12,       The benefit British companies bring to the United kingdom balance of payments was recently examined interdepartmentally andmay be set our broadly as follows :-SECI1ET
(a) They provide oil for the United Kingdom itself at minimum costin foreign exchange,,    If their oil here were provided on the samebalance of payments terms as foreign company supplies (and theseare quite good), it would cost us about  60 million more a yes-r.(b) The bulk of the BP and Shell sales - roughly 90 per cent - areoverseas.     The recent studies put the benefit to our balanceof payments of this very large overseas business at  160 million(in 1965).The total benefit, in savings on imports to the United Kingdom and in salesabroad, is therefore over  200 million a year.    It is difficult to assesshow much of this is attributable to the companies&apos; holdings in Arab oil,but it probably amounts to&apos;a third or more,    I mention these points asbackground to thinking on Middle East policy and our further study of oil policies,IV,   CONCLUSIONS13ft       I invite my colleagues to note:(a) That I have allowed ICI to test further Russian reactions to providing a special supply of naphtha, on the understandingthat if they succeed, an import licence will be granted.    Similarcases would then be allowed.    Publicity will be undesirable,(b) That I have arranged for the possibility of a long-term supply from Russia to be included in a new study of ways and meansof improving the security of oil supplies,(c) The importance to our balance of payments of our stake in overseas oil and in Arab oil in particular.R.
