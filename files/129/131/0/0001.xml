*S.E.P,(67)2nd meeting.civil REVIEW:    ROADSI Introductionof Referencei 1 officials were instructed &quot;to carry out a review of the civil expenditure programmes to 1970, particularly as regards housing, education, roads,Booial security benefits, and health which would enable Ministers to assess the implications of any major changes in priorities amongstthese programmes and would therefore comprise a range of possibilities,lith their economic and social implications, on the basis of which ministers could consider the priorities and possible reductions on the total..&quot;scope of the Roads Block1,2  The roads block of expenditure consists of three main items:(a) The road programme, comprising the new construction and improvement of major roads, i.e. motorways, trunk and principal roads;(b) Construction and improvement of minor roads, road lighting,car parks, etc.; and(c) Maintenance of all roads.Changes since 19661.3  The figures for roads expenditure to 1970-71 shown in last year&apos;sP.E.S.C. report have been adjusted for:-(i)   the reductions decided after July 20th 1966;(ii)    changes in the classification of local authority roadsmade as a result of the Local Government Act 1966;and in the definitions of maintenance and minor improvement;(iii)   uprating to 1967 price levels.1.U   The resulting figures, projected forward a further year to1971-72 at a level -  32.9 million, or h.6 per cent, above that in1970-71 - which would not prejudge a decision to accelerate ordecelerate the rate of growth of the programme thereafter, are considered to be a reasonable interpretation of the cost of existing policy and therefore constitute the basis for the civil review.The following is the result:-

This is because:-(i)   The present programme (to 1969-70) was agreed by ministers in 1965. inter alia on the grounds that &quot;we were stillspending proportionately less on roads than nearly allother highly developed countries   that improved roads werefundamental to regional development:   and that the economicreturn on the investment would be substantial.&quot;*Quoted from Cabinet (65)28th Conclusion, 15.7.1965.2
CONFIDENTIAL , n10(ii)   Most of the improvement is needed on tiie 10 per cent of the&apos;        total mileage of road which carrier nearly  two-thirds ofall the traffic (in England arid Wales)&apos;    Liany of theseroads are patently inadequate to cope efficiently even with existing traffic loads.   Kor will they oe improved uy 1970under the present programme or for man;/ years after that.As the traffic level rises, the economic losses caused uytraffic delays and accidents will increase , unless theroads are improved to a standard adequate to meet theadditional traffic.(iii)   We are in the middle of a traffic explosion.    In 1966, thetotal number of vehicles licensed in Great Britain rose to13.2 million, of which 9 million were cars;    this figure is almost double that for 1956, and traffic volumesincreased in almost exactly tiie same proportion.    3y 1970,only three years ahead, a projection of current trendstaking into account the fact that the recent economic measures will exercise some short-term restraint, showsthat the.vehicle population will reach  between 16 and17 million, of which cars will number over 12 million.Looking further ahead, the Road Research Laboratoryestimates that the number of vehicles licensed will rise to25-27 million (including 21-22 million cars) oy 19b0.Though the rise in car numbers is faster than that ofcommercial vehicles, it is the growth of the combined totalwhich causes congestion, thus inflicting losses on both.The Relationship between Road and Rail1.6 Although many trunk roads parallel the main railway routes,they generally cater for different types of traffic.   While it iscurrent policy to encourage the transfer to rail of everything than can economically go by rail, the scope for this is limited.80 per cent of the journeys now made by lorry are of less than25 miles - a distance over which rail can seldom offer economiccompetition even where suitable routes exist.   Even on the mostoptimistic assumptions, the maximum transfer of freight from road to rail would represent under 9 per cent of the road freight tonmileage in 1972 - less than 1 per cent of all vehicle miles travelled.Although it is true that the greater part of this reduction will bein journeys by heavy vehicles (which will tend to reduce bothcongestion and the need for road maintenance) the conclusion must oethat the maximum economic use of the railways could not relieve roadcongestion by more than the equivalent of a few months&apos; growth.3
kMaintenance1,7  The greater part of the remaining expenditure or. rondo connl:;tcof maintenance.   There are about 913,000 mile;.; of motorway::, trunic,principal and classified roads in Great britain and anoth-ir106,000 miles of unclassified reads.    The costs of maintaining theseeven to a minimum standard must be expected to increor.e year  jy year as a result of the increasing volume and weight of traffic and theadditional mileage of new roads.1,8   A wide-ranging study is in hand to ensure that futuremaintenance costs are kept to the ausolute minimum.    It is clear,however, that the ten-year programme of maintenance and minor improvements, agreed in 196k and incorporated in the 1nnsic&apos;programme of roads expenditure, is Inadequate 30th .^eco.i-:e the weight and volume of traffic have increased more quickly than expected, and because the original estimates of cost were too low.The re-estimated level of work, including essential maintenance,(would require an additional  30 million a year after 1967/68, out this could only be achieved within che programme at the expense of reducing major improvements.   No provision has therefore been madefor it.1.9   The maintenance of motorways and trunk roads is the direct responsibility of Central Government Departments;   but local authorityroads (about 95 per cent of the total) are maintained oy theauthorities themselves, assisted oy the Government now only throughRate Support Grant, and not subject to direct control.    This haspresented us with a difficulty in deciding how a reduction in totalroads expenditure might be distributed.   During the 1966negotiations about Rate Support Grant it oecame clear that the localauthorities&apos;  own estimates of need were much higher- than these wehad included in the I966 P.S.3.C. Report, which were oased partly onthe earlier ten-year programme of maintenance expenditure and partly on a statistical projection which is now relieved to oe inadequate.Nevertheless, Rate Support Grant was finally settled at the levelindicated oy the P.E.S.C. figures, and the result is that the localauthorities, too, regard the provision for maintenance (and forother relatively minor roads items covered oy Rate Support Grant) asoeing inadequate.    Since local authorities are in fact free, to spendwhat they consider necessary on road maintenance, it is likely that expenditure on these items will increase, with or without an increasein Rate Support Grant.   Nevertheless, the basic programme assumes that the planned figures for maintenance of local authority roadswill be adhered to.
1,10 In considering how any cuts in roads expenditure would oeapportioned therefore, we have assumed that expend it jre on maintenance of these roads could not in practice oe cut.   Thus, a cut in the roads block total would have to oe borne almost entireby the road programme.1.11 In the sections that follow, we examine the existing EnglishScottish and Welsh programmes of roads expenditure ia turn and consider the effects on each of an increase of 5 per cent or areduction of 7i per cent.5

These figures also take no account of the reduction in the 1965 programme.The Situation on Trunk Roads2.7   Congestion, and hence economic loss, on trunk roads is inevitably at its worst on those sections of the main arterialroutes between industrial centres, the principal towns and the docks where road improvements have not been carried out.    the trunk road and motorway programmes are therefore concentrated on* Travel and Accident Loss is a method of quantifying the deficiencies of roads in monetary terms.   The loss is the^difference between operating costs plus accident costs as theyactually are on a particular section of road and as they wouldbe if the road were built to modern standards of design.7Tke Growth of Traffic Congestion2.k   This basic programme will not keep pace with the growth oftraffic congestion.     Although opinions differ about whatconstitutes an unacceptable degree of congestion, there can beno doubt that the mileage of road on which congestion occurs is increasing and will continue to do so.2.5   One indicator of this is overload (which relates trafficvolumes to design capacity of roads).    Even allowing for thecompletion of the basic programme as originally approved in 1965,it is estimated that out of a total of 5,400 miles of trunk road&apos;in England the mileage of overloaded road would increase asfollows between 1966 and 1970:-
relief of these routes;   other schemes for which there isconsiderable public pressure but on which severe congestion isseasonalt e.g. holiday roui.es, do not appear in the programme.An example is the A. 30 in the South-West.The Urban situation.8   The problem of traffic in towns, where 80% of the populationlive and work, involves a whole complex of policies in thetransport and planning field, such as the improvement and greater use of public transport, comprehensive traffic management p.ndparking controls, the feasibility in the longer tern, of more positive methods of restraint and possibly also changes in the pattern of land use.     But on any reasonable assessment of thesituation there is a significant gap between the level  of nnvest-ment at present foreseen on urban road improvement and thatnesessary to cope effectively with existing and future urbantraffic needs, including the provision of adequate links with theinter-urban network.2.9   Urban road improvement must also be considered in the wider context of general uroan redevelopment.   The latter -particularly housing and town centre redevelopment - is taking place in any event and is not being matched by adequateroad construction.    (Public expenditure on town centre redevelopmerschemes, which was severely restrained in 1965-66 and 1966-6?,is expected to rise considerably in 1967-68 and subsequent years.One result is that new development has to be served mainly from existing inadequate roads, thereby positively worsening the traffic and environmental problems and presenting an obstacle to the effective replanning of the road system as a whole over the next30 years or more.Roads as a factor in New Development2.10 Road schemes are selected for inclusion in the programmemainly for the economic and social benefits they offer in termsof the relief of traffic congestion - particularly the relief ofindustrial and commercial traffic.    Thus the rate of return basedon T.A.L. is an important factor in assessing priorities.8
2.11 With the exception of the North-East Special programme and roadswhich serve New and Expanded Towns no road schemes have been includedin the English road programme specifically to stimulate local orregional development.   Nevertheless a number of schemes which areincluded primarily on traffic grounds will also serve to supportplans for the economic development of the regions, the growth of the ports (including container traffic) and the expansion of particulartowns.The Erosion of the programme ,12 The road programme announced in 1965 has already suffered in anumber of ways.2,13 First, as a result of the economy measures taken in 1965 and1966,  55 million worth of new schemes were deferred for six months and the five year programme of expenditure to 1969-70 was thusreduced by about  25 million.2.11+ Second, owing to inevitable time lags, increases in the cost ofland and road construction have not been fully covered by adjustments to the authorised level of expenditure since 196h.   It is estimatedthat the real value of the programme has in this way been diminishedby a further  14 million.2.15 Third, at constant prices, completion of the 1,000 miles motor-way programme is now expected to cost about  i+5 million more than thesame mileage was expected to cost last year.   Within a fixedexpenditure ceiling for roads the consequent additional motorwaypayments within the period are being met by deferring trunk roadscheme s.5 per cent Increase *   millionExisting programme Addition Revised total	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	471 .6	534.3 Nil	567.3 18.7	609.7 30.3	636.9 41.1	1+71.6	534.3	586.0 L ,-	640,0	678.02.16  An increase of 5 per cent in Road block expenditure in1970-71 would permit additional expenditure of about  30 million inthat year and lesser additions in earlier years.   Perhaps half ofthis sum would be required to meet the increased cost of maintenancereferred to in paragraph 1.8 above, the unavoidable extra cost of items falling under RSG, and for road lighting.   On the basis of present trends, this would still be some  20 million below the localauthorities&apos; likely bid for that year in the next round of Rate8upport Grant negotiations.   If, however, this is resisted, the9C0NFIDBITIA1
remainder would be devoted to the road programme, permitting it topise by about 4 per cent, with particular emphasis on the trunk road programme which has suffered disproportionately as a result of the factors mentioned in paragraphs 2.12 - 2.15 above.   Furthermore, adecision by Ministers to authorise the second generation ofNew Towns (see Section III of this Report) would carry with it inevitable additional expenditure on roads which would be a charge against the Roads block.jj- per cent reduction   millionExisting programme Reduction Revised total	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	2+71.6	534.3 15.6	567.3 27.3	609.7 1+5.7	636,9 42.9	471.6	518.7	540.0	564.0	594.02.17   We have asumed that it would not be practicable to cutexpenditure on maintenance.   An overall reduction of 7i per cent in english Roads 31ock expenditure in 1970/71 would, therefore, demanda cut in the road programme and other capital expenditure of10  per cent in that year.Effect on the Road programme .18   The annual reductions shown in the above Table for 1968/69 and1969/70   offer a practicable progression between the agreedexpenditure for 1967/68 and the required reduction in 1970/71.   they take account of the need to avoid unacceptably large fluctuations inthe annual level of new commitments for the reasons discussed in thenext paragraph and of the fact that for 1968/69 a large part of the block has already been fixed during the Rate Support Orantnegotiations.2.19   The progression set out in the Table offers a reduction of3 per cent in 1968/69.   Any larger proportionate cut in that year would create programming difficulties.   On average, only 10 per cent -15 per cent of payments on new road construction   schemes are madein the first year (i.e. the year of commitment), the bulk of paymentsfalling in the second and third years.   Consequently, a very largevalue of schemes would have to be deferred to obtain significantexpenditure savings in 1968/69 by reducing starts in that year alone.Such severe cuts in commitments in one year would inevitablyproduce wide fluctuations in the level of new starts in subsequent years.   This must be avoided, and the only practical way of doing so would be to Introduce reductions earlier in the programme by reducing once again the level of new starts in 1967/68 - the third
such reduction since July 1963.   Thus a reduction of auout 70 million worth of new starts in 1967/68 would save  20 million in1968/69 (i.e. the second year) but would also reduce expenditure in1967/60 itself by about  7 -  10 million2.20   In order to achieve the reductions shown in the Table above,year oy year beginning in 1968-69 a larger and larger value of newstarts would have to be deferred by at least one year until oy1970-71 it would be necessary to defer until the following yearabout  1^0 million worth (about 1+0 per cent) of the schemes planned for commitment in that year ^see Table following paragraph 2.22oelow).2.21   These deferments would have to be shared  between principal(mainly uroan) roads, trunk roads and motorways.    In considering thesplit it would be necessary to bear in mind the following:-(a) the principal (mainly uroaiQ road programme has beenmanifestly indadequate to meet the need for urban roadbuilding and is therefore now the fastest growing sector of the present road programme to 1970.(b) The 1.000 mile motorway programme.   A significant reduction in motorway expenditure would inevitably mean that the strategic network of 1,000 miles of motorwayswould not be completed oy the &quot;early 1970&apos;s&quot;, the dateannounced oy the previous Administration andre-affirmed by the present one.   Any significant cutwould delay completion from the present planned date of1973-74 until 1974-75 or later.(c) The trunk road programme has already suffered to accommodate the additional cost of the 1,000 milesmotorway programme.   Schemes that have not so far found a place in the present trunk road programme offer high-savings of Travel and Accident Loss and many of them would serve other physical planning objectives.2.22   In the following example the allocation of the cut favours thePrincipal (mainly urban) roads but, in the final analysis, anyactual division would need to oe a matter for political decision inthe light of all the circumstances.11

However, some schemes, at the margin ofthe present programme, will also be serving to support plans of regional development, and a reduction in road expenditure is boundto mean a choice between deferring schemes with high traffic and safety importance and schemes with lower traffic benefits but important developmental benefits.2.2h   The benefits offered by representative road schemes and theconsequences of their deferment are illustrated in some detail at annex G, which includes a number of schemes of various types whichwould be in jeopardy, selected at random from longer lists which addup to  lhO million in value in 1970-71.affect on Other Parts of the Road Block2.25  We assume that capital expenditure on Unclassified roads,Car Parks, Road Lighting, Research and certain other minor elementswould also have to be cut by lO-g- per cent in 1970-71.General Considerations and Longer Term Consequences2.26  Deferment on the scale discussed above would far exceed the severity of the cuts made in July 1965 and July 1966 and would1966/69     1969/70     1970/71    TOTALS  ran.  mn.-t, inn.L mn.181220-55362440Too56- 444014011.03010018	36	56miles	miles	miles15	30	57miles	miles	miles22	44	44Urban	urban	Urbancherries *	Scheme s&apos;:&apos;	Schemes*Average size about  1 million
damage still further public confidence in the Government&apos;a attitudetowards road improvements.   Indeed, a cut of the order contemplated would mean, in effect, a major change of policy on the road programme *2.27   Greater efficiency in the road construction industry isheavily dependent on more investment in modern capital equipment andrationalisation of the structure of the industry.   This demandsconfidence on the part both of the industry and of local authoritiesin the Government&apos;s future intentions towards the road programme.2.28   A decision to reduce roads expenditure in the period up to1970/71 would inevitably flatten off the programme during the early1970&apos;s at a level significantly oelow that which the Ministry regard as a minimum.   Neither the industry nor the local authorities couldadapt themselves quickly to a suosequent acceleration, and anysudden increase would involve a series of unacceptable fluctuations in the annual level of new starts.   The decision, once taken, couldnot rapidly be reversed.    It would put off for several years all hope of achieving even the lowest level of road-building necessaryto prevent a very substantial increase in traffic congestion in the1970/80 period.   The economic consequences cannot easily be assessedbut in the Ministry of Transport&apos;s view would be very serious indeed.

However if a decision were taken to go aheadvdth the second generation New Towns, which were put forward in anadditional programme last year and which have not yet been designated,associated roads expenditure would of necessity have to beincreased - and by considerably more than five per cent.    In short,any decision, to vary the level of New Town roads expenditure in either direction must be dependent on decisions on the future ofthe New Town programme itself.
CONFIDENTIALIV     SootlandThp exist in? programme,1   There are aspects dealt with in. the section on England - the urban section (paragraphs 2.8 and 2.9), the erosion of the road programme (paragraphs 2.12 to 2.15), general considerations(paragraphs 2.26 to 2.28) - which are common in equal or less degree to the situation in Scotland:    they are not mentioned specificallyin the following paragraphs.4.2   Existing programmes provide for total expenditure on Scottishroads in 1970/71 of  70.2 million of which  40.3 million would be spent on construction and improvement of major roads.   expenditure is planned to increase to a peak level in 1971/72, about 27 percent above the 1967/68 level, after which it is expected toflatten out.     The annual increases vary from 12 per cent in 1968/69to less than 2 per cent in 1970/71.4,3  During the 1960&apos;s expenditure on trunk roads has been, and willcontinue to be, concentrated on completing the programme, details ofwhich were published in the 1963 White Paper on Central   Scotlandand the 1966 White Paper on the Scottish Economy 1965 to 1970.This programme - designed to complete a modern network of routes between the main industrial areas of the Central Belt and provideconnections with the motorway system in England - promised theconstruction of 209 miles of dual carriageway and motorway routesby 1970 and a further 80 miles by about 1972.4.4   As stated in the 1966 White Paper, the classified road programme is oriented towards meeting the ,needs of scottish development.    It has four main objectives:   the improvement to modern standards of inter-urban roads;   the construction and reconstruction of the main traffic routes in cities and towns as part of comprehensive redevelopment;    theconstruction of a classified road system in the four New Towns;and the continued improvement of roads in the Highlands and islands,mainly under the Crofter Counties Programme.-4.5 Of the balance of the 1970/71 programme  6.2 million is forthe new construction and improvement of unclassified roads, for oarparks and road lighting;    2.4 million is for trunk road maintenancejand  20.8 million is for maintenance of all other roads.   All but 3.1 million of this balance is local authority expenditure.15

The demands of known programmes could easilyabsorb more money particularly in the later years, allowing   foraccelerating preparation of schemes.     Glasgow alone could spendmuch of the increase on schemes supporting planned redevelopmentand there are many similar projects on a smaller scale in large burghs as well as worthwhile schemes on non-urban principal roads,e.g. serving the N.A.T.O. base at Faslane, improving the mainaccess from Perth to Braemar and the eastern Cairngorms.li per cent reduction   million	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72Existing programme	58.1	65.3	68.9	70.2	74.0Reduction	mm	3.4	4.6	5.4	5.6Revised total	58.1	61.9	64.3	64.3	68.416l+SJLS^ increase   miUioii
It would be unrealistic to cut current expenditure on maintenance of all roads, and on road lighting, the annual growth rate of which provided for in the basic programme is only dustover 1 per cent 5 and since Capital expenditure by local authorities on non-principal and unclassified road a, car parks and roadlighting amounts to only 13 per cent of total capital investment on roads, most of the reduction must - inevitably fall onthe major road programme.     In 1970/71 this would amount to  4.million or 11.4 per cent.     If such a cut were borne in proportion by trunk and principal roads the main effect on the trunk roads would be to delay the completion of the programme by at least two years until 1975.   In other terms, the programme would be 51miles short in 1972 and starts on particular schemes - forexample the last scheme to complete the priority trunk route betweenScotland and England (the Gretna Bypass); the Eishopton bypass forthe Glasgow-Greenock trunk road A.8; and the Newbridge (Edinburgh)to Polmont and Falkirk bypass section of the Edinburgh to StirlingMotorway - would be delayed by six months to a year.   The effecton the classified road programme, which is largely controlled by thelocal authorities is more difficult to assess, but the completion ofthe first half of the Glasgow Inner Ring Road, which is a vital partof Glasgow&apos;s programme of redevelopment, would certainly be delayed,as would the start of a number of modernisation schemes in otherurban areas.   In addition there would be delays in particularschemes designed to support the economic development, such asimprovement of the A.8 in Greenock to help the development of acontainer terminal as well as a revised principal road pattern forthe Falkirk/Grangemouth Growth Area.   A sample list of schemes thatwould be affected Hy a 7i per cent cut ie attached at Annex D.4.9   So far as the earlier years of the period are concerned, the cuts have been so phased as to reduce expenditure on 1968-69 by5.2 per cent and in 1969-70 by 6.7 per cent.     Because reductions inone year have inescapable implication for expenditure in following years, any larger reduction in these earlier years would have meant a greater cut back in 1970-71 than li per cent.17GOOTIEEHTXAL
V.      y/n leaiphpjixiatinfl programme,1 Existing programmes provide for total expenditure on .&apos;/elsh roadsin 1970/71 of  35.3 million, of which  13.4 million would he spent onconstructing and improving major roads. V/ith the completion of some major schemes, expenditure will fill substantially in 1967/68, but is planned to rise thereafter, so that in 1971/72, expenditure would be34\ per cent above the 1967/68 level (16 per cent above the 1966/67level - which would not, however, be exceeded until 1970/71).5.2  During the 1960&apos;s new construction expenditure is beintfconcentrated on improving the links between South East V/ales and england.     Over the next few years the programme will be largelydevoted to completing the links with the Ross Spur and the severn bridge, and attempting to keep pace with growing congestion in Northand South V/ales.     In 1969 the first of three colliery closure schemes will be committed.     Ministers have attached much importance to these schemes which are designed to improve the major routes giving access to some of the mining valleys of West Glamorgan, where, to add topresent unemployment, further large-scale redundancies are expected in the near future.      Some of these schemes have been included on grounds other than an assessment of their immediate, benefit to traffic:economic rates of return tend to be on the low side in V/ales, even where congestion is severe, partly because of the high constructioncosts in hilly country.5.3    The annual provision of  2.5 million for the maintenance and minor improvement (m. and m.i.) of trunk roads is seriously inadequate,but even to keep the programme at this basic minimum it will benecessary for the Welsh Office to transfer  0.7 million, previouslyallocated to major works, to m. and m.i. in 1968/69 and 1969/70.This transfer, combined with the effect of programming difficultiesin previous years, will require the planned starting dates of some ofthe most important major schemes to be delayed by up to a year (seecolumns (ii) and (iii) of Annex E), under the present expenditure programme.5.4 Of the rest of the programme,  5.2 million is for reconstruction of - minor roads, car parks, etc., and  14.2 million is for maintenance and minor improvement of all other local roads. These items consistalmost entirely of local authority expenditure.18

Therewould be no possibility of bringing any new schemes into theprogramme.5.6   A recosting of the m. and m.i. programme shows that additional expenditure of  5.7 million on motorways and trunk road3 and 3.9 million on classified roads would be required in the year31968/69-1971/72 if the physical programme originally envisaged wereto he carried out within the 10 year period planned.     Thus even ifthe 5 per cent increase were applied wholly to this class of work,it would still be impossible to fulfil the physical programme - andthis takes no account of the additional mileage which has been foundto need attention since the programme was started.5.7   In short, a 5 per cent increase would be insufficient to enablethe Welsh Office to carry out the programmes which vjere planned forthe years up to 1971/72, and there would therefore be no room forfurther schemes for which the Welsh Office would vjish, if circumstances permitted, to present a. case.7s per cent reduction m	1967/68	1968/69	1969/70	1970/71	1971-/72Existing total	28.0	29.1	31.2	35.6	37.5lie duct ion	-	0.6	0.7	2.6	.2.4Revised total	28.0	28.5	30.5	33.0	35.1
5,8   If a 5 per cent increase is insufficient to meet the intendedphysical programme, a 7--: per cent reduction would clearly have serious consequences.     Maintenance is already at an irreduceableminimum, and has indeed encroached upon the previous provision for new consbruction.     The full brunt of a reduction would have to fallon the capital works programme.     This would entail cutting majorroad expenditure of  13.4 million in 1970/71 by  2.6 million, or nearly 20 per cent, though it would be very difficult to make any considerable reductions in the earlier years.     The practical effect,shown in Annex E, would be to delay seven schemes, or half of the welsh programme, by nine months to a year beyond the current (butalready delayed) starting dates.     Of these schemes two involve the trunk routes serving Cardiff, and two are on the &quot;Heads of the Valley&quot;route linking Swansea and the Midlands.     Of the remaining sevenprogrammed schemes two are already well into preparation and couldnot readily be delayed, but the other five would also have to be delayed by up to six months.20
VI.    Infrastructure Grants6,1 In the Transport Policy White Paper published in July, 1966, theMinister of Transport said&quot;The Government already contributes heavily to the cost ofbuilding and improving main roads in towns.   It now proposes anan extension of this.   It intends to take powers to provide financial help for the construction or major improvement of public transportstructures that form part of comprehensive local transport plans -railways, new forms of reserved track transport which may be developed,and terminal and interchange facilities on public transport systems.&quot;6,2 In agreeing in principle to this subsidy in July 1966, theChancellor made the condition that he was not committed to any increasein total expenditure on transport.   It was left for later consideration whether this new expenditure should be contained within the existingP.B.S.C. limits for the roads block or at the expense of expenditurein some other field.6,3 The assistance will take the form of Exchequer Capital Grants at various rates.   Although no individual projects have yet reached thepoint at which formal proposals can be considered, the following arelikely to be among the schemes that will come forward for commitment in the next few years:-The development of the Mersey railwayThe London Tube extensions.6,1). Until schemes like these have been examined, no precise estimates of expenditure in particular years can be formulated.     Nevertheless,the Ministry suggest that by 1970-71, total expenditure could reach 35-UO million a year.     Some of this money, - we cannot say how much -might otherwise have been spent by British Railways or the london transport Board, and would therefore have been regarded as- &quot;investment by nationalised industries&quot;.    In some cases, it might reduce theimmediacy of the need for otherwise inevitable urban road schemes;    tothat extent these sums are not entirely &quot;additional&quot;.     However, theyare not provided for specifically either in the Roads Block or elsewhere at present, and we have not considered this expenditure inrelation either to the &quot;basic programme&quot; for the Civil Review or forthe 5 per cent addition to or 7? per cent reduction from that programme.   We therefore record the position so that the attentionof Ministers may be drawn to the existence of this substantial furtherdemand on available resources.21

The existing road network between thetwo temporary terminal:.: of M.4 would be quite unable to cope with such volumesof traffic, even if interim improvements were carried out.   In these circum-stances much traffic between London and South Wales would continue to use theold A.40 route, thus resulting in under-use of the existing sections of M.4.Already, since the opening of the Severn Bridge last September there has boon a100S4 increase in traffic on A.4. between Chipjenham and Calne and 120% increase on A.420 between Tormarton and Chippenham,   There have also been increaseddifficulties in Reading.M.23 London - CrawleyThis motorway will be the artery between Crawley, a now town whereindustry has made a very strong development, and London.

By 1969 theT.A.L. will have risen to  161,000 per mile at Portchester,  155,000 per mile atFareham and  70,000 per mile at Sarisbury increasing to  374,000 per mile, 248,000 per mile and  106,000 per mile respectively by 1974.   Losses of this magnitude indicate the 1974 first year rate of return will be of the order of2$.The new highway will remove all through traffic (estimated at 75/i of thetotal flow) from the towns and hamlwts of Portchester, Wellington, Fareham,Titchfield, Sarisbury and West *nd and to a lesser extent the traffic throughthe outskirts of Southampton, thereby substantially relieving the congestion and delay, improving environment and facilitating access both to Southampton andPortsmouth (town and docks).

The 1965 census at Dunsville gave a volume of 18,500 p.c.us per day,of which 26% was commercial vehicles.   The overload is of the order of 210$.The 1969 T.A.L. at Dunsville is  228,000 per mile increasing to  4-20,000 pormile in 1974.   The T.A.L. through Doncaster, where measurements were not taken,would bo very much higher.The by-pass scheme will remove all east/west through traffic betweenSheffield and other areas west of the Ciroat i-Torth Road and Humbersiue.   this traffic is estimated at approximately ;30;o of the total flow mentioned above.The scheme should produce a 1974 first year rate of return of 16 .Wellington By-pass A.5Length 5 miles.

This traffic overloads thecarriageway by 200/i.   Traffic on this route has been increasing at the average rate of 8% per annum since 1961 which is above the national average.It is estimated that tho T.A.L. will bo  74,000 per mile by 1969, increasingto  101,000 by 1974 on which basis the 1974 first year rate of return from thescheme would be 9$.   These estimates, howover, make no allowance for the -proposed residential and industrial expansion of the Wellington/Oakengatea area and adjacent Dawloy New Town where the present population is expected to increase from 70,000 to over 100,000 by 1972 subsequently increasing to 200,000 by 1981.

Thetown centre is a barrier to free movement of cross traffic.To cope with these conditions a system of relief roads to the east, southand west has been planned, which it is hoped to complete eventually with a relief road to the north.   Much of the eastern route has been completed, whilsttne construction of the southern route is now in progress.   The Pitlake, etc.widening scheme is designed to deal with the most difficult part of the westernrelief road.   Its present condition is extremely poor - a two lane carriageway,unsatisfactory junctions and dense frontal development.This scheme besides being of value in itself will enable greatereconomic benefit to be obtained from those parts of the perimeter relief roadswhich have been or are being constructed.   Once embarked on this system of roads, it should be completed as quickly as possible.Crawley Read Improvement Hillingdon - Estimated Cost  150.000This is a case of a non-metropolitan road which has very considerablethrough traffio value especially in relation to London Airport to which it isa feeder.   But an equally important function is to serve the several built-upcommunities of Outer London through which it passes.   It carries quite heavytraffio and those parts of it which have not yet been improved have a narrowtortuous carriageway, with difficult junctions and often with narrow footpaths.All this adds up to a thoroughly unsatisfactory road quite inadequate for its functions.Some years ago the Middlesex County Council embarked on a policy of improving the road as a whole to a standard of a well aligned 3 lanecarriageway with adequate footpaths and improved junctions.   Several seotionsi    &apos; ...have already been completed and it is now more desirable than ever to oompletethe improvement of the road as a Whole,both to eliminate the danger of travelling from good on to bad sections and to obtain the full eoonoraic benefits of part expenditure.30

Thetown centre is a barrier to free movement of cross traffic.To cope with these conditions a system of relief roads to the east, southand west has been planned, which it is hoped to complete eventually with a relief road to the north.   Much of the eastern route has been completed, whilst the construction of the southern route is now in progress.   The Pitlake, etc,widening scheme is designed to deal with the most difficult part of the westernrelief road.   Its present condition is extremely poor - a two lane carriageway,unsatisfactory junctions and dense frontal development.This scheme besides being of value in itself will enable greatereconomic benefit to be obtained from those parts of the perimeter relief roadswhich have been or are being constructed.   Once embarked on this system of roads, it should be completed as quickly as possible.Crawley Road Improvement Hillingdon - Estimated Cost  150*000This is a case of a non-metropolitan road which has very considerablethrough traffio value especially in relation to London Airport to which it isa feeder.   But an equally important function is to serve the several built-upcommunities of Outer London through which it passes.   It carries quite heavytraffio and those parts of it which have not yet been improved have a narrowtortuous carriageway, with difficult junctions and often with narrow footpaths.All this adds up to a thoroughly unsatisfactory road quite inadequate for its functions.Some years ago the Middlesex County Council embarked on a policy of improving the road as a whole to a standard of a well aligned 3 lanecarriageway with adequate footpaths and improved junctions.   Several seotionsjhave already been completed and it is now more desirable than ever to complete the improvement of the road as &amp; whole, both to eliminate the danger of travelling from good on to bad sections and to obtain the full economic benefits of part expenditure.30
