SECRET 159IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(67) 108 COPY NO.    g /21st June, 1967CABINETTHE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK TO 1972Memorandum by the First Secretary of State and secretary of State for Economic affairs attach, for the information of the Cabinet and as-backgroundfor the discussions on public expenditure, a copy of the Report by the medium Term Assessment Committee on the Economic Outlook to1972.    The main features of the study are given in Chapter I,paragraphs 1 to 27, and the conclusions are summarised inparagraphs 5 and 6.2.      The Report is intended to provide the basic material for discussions of general economic policy affecting the medium term.In addition, it provides a background for the review of public expenditure and for consideration of longer-term taxation policy.The Report will also be used for the preparation of an Outline plan for possible publication later in the year.3.      The Report examines a number of alternative assumptionscovering the effects both of the uncertainties in the situation(e. g. in the growth of productivity) and of possible changes in policy(e. g. in the level of public expenditure).4,      The Report concludes that on present public expenditure programmes the rise in consumption would have to be severelyrestrained.    Average consumption per head of population would increase at only 1, 6 per cent a year up to 1970 and at only 0. 8 percent a year from 1970 to 1972.     These increases compare with anaverage increase of 2. 3 per cent a year over the last decade.    a corollary of this would be a rise in taxation rates; the figures given in the paper are provisional until detailed work has beencompleted, but this does not disturb the consumption figures above.This conclusion is on the assumption that productivity rises at asimilar rate to that achieved in the past.    In the absence of any evidence of an improvement, I consider that this is the bestassumption to take for the purpose of deciding medium term public expenditure programmes.    However, even if a higher rate of increase in productivity were achieved, the magnitude of the problemswithin this period created by the rise in public expenditure would notbe greatly reduced.    Moreover, an increase in output would be likelyto be accompanied by a less satisfactory balance of payments.    Theestimates do not allow for changes resulting from entry into theEuropean Economic Community which could be adverse toconsumption and the balance of payments in the early years followingaccession.M, S.Department of Economic Affairs, S.

economic outlook to 1972CHAPTER I.  THE MAIN FEATURES AND conclusions this report considers the economic outlook to 1972. The conclusions - andthe main features are summarised below. Chapters II to VII discuss differentaspects of the projections.2. Our basic projection assumes that productivity per man-hour will increase at a rate similar to that in the past; it can be taken as a &quot; realistic &quot; projection.The other main projection assumes that productivity will accelerate; it may beregarded as a reasonable aspiration.3. In both the main cases examined, the public expenditure programmes are taken from the 1967 PESC Review, and it has been assumed that the economy will be regulated so that unemployment will decrease slowly up to 1970 and thenremain stable at 1-75 per cent.4. The effects on the projections have been examined of a lower public expenditure programme and of running the economy with a higher level ofunemployment. In addition, the uncertainties on the balance of payments areillustrated by assuming a lower growth of world trade than assumed in the mainprojections.conclusions.  The main conclusions can be summarised as follows:(i) The outlook up to 1970 is much as indicated in our earlier reports.  Ifthe economy is run so that unemployment falls slowly to 1-75 per cent,the gross domestic product should grow at about 3^ per cent a year.The balance of payments should be in surplus by about  200 million a year.(ii) This outlook is precarious. It will be difficult to avoid either trouble withthe balance of payments or too high unemployment.(iii) There are many uncertainties and quite moderate changes in factorsbeyond the Government^ control (e.g., the growth of world trade)whioh could affect the picture substantially.(iv) An easier balance of payments is expected in the period 1970-72primarily because output is expected to grow more slowly.(v) On present public expenditure programmes, there will be a squeeze on consumption during the period and a need to raise taxes substantially.(vi) There are doubts as to whether manufacturing investment will risesufficiently fast to provide any acceleration in the growth of productivity.(vii) Credit has been taken for a reasonable degree of success in the prices and incomes policy and for the effect on wages of assuming a higher levelof unemployment than in the past.(viii) Some members of the Committee are doubtful how far the growth in incomes will in practice be restrained over the next few years and forthis and other reasons take a less sanguine view of the balance ofpayments.6. The summary tables below show the key figures in our two mainprojections.

Our main projection is based on the continuation of the rate of increasein output per man-hour of between 2 - 8 and 3 per cent a year that occurred in theperiod 1960-65. The higher case assumes an acceleration of 0-2 per cent a year after 1968, i.e., a rate of increase in 1972 of 0-8 per cent a year higher than in themain projection.8. Only a small reduction in the working week has been assumed following therecent round of reductions. We have, however, assumed a further extension of paidholidays so that most workers will get three weeks by 1972.9. The working population is expected to decline slightly up to 1970 and muchmore sharply in the period 1970-72 when the school leaving age is raised. Thereduction will, however, be concentrated on young workers and the numbers of adult workers will slightly increase. Since adults may be assumed to be more productive, this change in the composition of the working population should partly offset the effect on output of the decline in absolute numbers.10. Making allowance for these various factors, we arrive at an estimate for the growth of productive potential (i.e., the growth rate at a constant level ofunemployment) of an average of 2-8 per cent a year from 1967-72 on the mainprojection and of 3 - 2 per cent in the higher productivity case.11. The increase in output on our main projection (i.e., assuming trendproductivity) should average about 3^ per cent a year from 1967-70 as some of theslack is taken up in the economy, with unemployment being gradually reduced to1-75 per cent in 1970. This means that by 1970 output should be about 161 Percent higher than in 1964, as compared with the 25 per cent increase postulated inthe National Plan. In the higher productivity case, the increase in output from1967-70 would be a little above 34- per cent a year. On the other hand, ifunemployment were maintained at 2 per cent up to 1970, the increase in output would average about 3-0 per cent a year.12. In 1971 and 1972 output would increase more slowly in both the maincases, partly because of the raising of the school leaving age and partly because it is assumed that no further slack in the economy will be taken up.Balance of payments (Chapter III)13. We have estimated that there will be an increase of about 9 per cent ayear on average in the value of world trade in manufactures; this is slightly belowthe average increase in the period 1960-66. We have allowed for an improvementin the United Kingdom&apos;s cost performance because we assume a reasonable degreeof success with incomes policy, and because a higher average level of unemploymentthan in the past will lead to a slower rate of increase in wage and salary costs (butthere are differing views about the size of this effect). As a result of these various factors the value of exports is expected to grow on average by 5\ per cent a year from 1967-72.
14. Imports, on the other hand, are estimated to increase more slowly thanin the past and more slowly than exports. The balance of payments is also expectedto be improved compared with the past because of Government measures already taken, e.g., the cuts in overseas expenditure and measures on capital account.15. On our main assumptions, the estimates suggest an average balance ofpayments surplus of about  200 million a year from 1968-70. This would be justsufficient to repay the IMF debt remaining after the end of 1967, but would leaveno substantial margin for contingencies or for rebuilding reserves.16. In 1971 and 1972 the surplus would increase (to about  500 million in1972), as imports rise relatively slowly in line with the slower rise in home demand and output, but exports continue to grow at about the same rate. But there mustbe great doubt about these figures.17. If, however, world trade were to grow at 1 per cent a year more slowly,the balance of payments would be less favourable, with the surplus being reducedby about  100 million in 1970. Moreover, if productivity were to grow more rapidly than assumed in our basic case, although eventually the consequentimprovement in costs would help our exports, the increase in home output and demand (assuming the same level of unemployment) would lead to higher imports.In these circumstances, the estimated balance of payments surplus in 1970 would again be reduced by about  100 million a year. Again, if incomes rose faster(as some of us feel probable) the balance of payments would be less favourable.A rise of \ per cent a year more than we have assumed would worsen the balanceof payments by about  100 million a year by 1972.18. The effect of allowing for a more cyclical development of the economy in this period has also been examined. The use of an assumption of a strongerboom about 1970 shows that we should quickly run into trouble on the balanceof payments; this would then have to be corrected by a cut-back in activity. Amore rapid rise in costs and prices during the boom period would adversely affectthe prospects in later years. The picture on the whole would therefore be less favourable than that with more steady growth.19. If unemployment were maintained at 2 per cent the balance of payments would be improved by about  150 million in 1970.Composition of national expenditure (Chapter IV)20. The effects of two programmes of public expenditure have been examined,the first being consistent with those contained in the 1967 Public expenditure survey which go up to 1971-72. The second involves a lower rate of increaseso that the total in 1970-71 does not exceed the total proposed by the Chancellorof the Exchequer in January, with corresponding reductions in earlier years. Thedifference between the two programmes in 1970-71 is about a little over  700million at 1967 survey prices.21. For housing we have taken a total of 475,000 in 1970 and thereafter, the shortfall from the Government^ target of 500,000 being assumed to occur in theprivate sector. Our general view was that the target figure would have involved an increase in expenditure on private housing which seemed unlikely in viewof the fact that personal disposable income will have to be held back by the need to restrain consumption. The Ministry of Housing, however, felt that the targetmight still be reached if the Government were to give sufficient priority to housing in the operation of its financial and fiscal policies and in the control of buildinglicences. The construction of the extra 25,000 houses to reach the target wouldinvolve expenditure of about  100 million (at 1970 prices). This sum would haveto be deducted from the figures for consumption in our projections and would need to be reflected in a corresponding increase in taxation, unless cuts were madein other investment (e.g., by building licensing). The balance of payments wouldbe little affected.22. Nationalised industries&apos; investment programmes are based on the latest information available, with some allowance for slippage in the early years. Theyare consistent with the growth of the economy assumed. The total continuesto rise up to 1968 and then levels out and falls. We believe this to be a plausiblepicture.
23. Forecasts are given for the required growth in private investment foreach of the main projections. We are somewhat doubtful as to whethermanufacturing investment will in fact increase sufficiently for the growth in outputassumed, at any rate on the higher growth projection.24. The levels of personal consumption consistent with the other claims on resources set out above are as follows:Average Annual Increase in Personal ConsumptionActual                     Trend higher productivity Productivity1957-66           1967-70      1970-72 1967-70     1970-72Highecpublic expenditure   ...                             2-4           1-6 2-6           2-73-0Lower*public expenditure   ...                             3-2           1-9 3-4           30As will be seen from the table, on our main projection the increase in consumptionwill be below the average of the last 10 years up to 1970 and only just over halfthe past rate in 1971 and 1972.Other matters (Chapters V-VII)25. A full report on the taxation implications of the projections will besubmitted later. It is already clear, however, that on the higher public expenditure programme, and on either the trend or higher productivity projections, there willhave to be a substantial increase in the rates of taxation, probably of the order of 500 million up to 1970 (quite apart from the normal increases in Local Authorityrates). With the lower public expenditure programme, tax rates over this periodmight be slightly reduced. With the rise in real incomes and rising prices, therewould, however, still be a substantial increase in the proportion of income takenin taxes. In the period 1970-72 a further comparable increase would be required on the higher public expenditure programme and some increase would probably also be needed on the lower programme.26. Entry into e.c. would also adversely affect the balance of paymentswithin the period under review. The effects have not been studied in detail, both because of the inherent difficulty of assessment and because the timing andconditions of entry could not be known. In the period up to 1972, however, the factors that would be likely to affect adversely the balance of payments (common agricultural policy and capital movements) would be operating to some extent,while the favourable stimulus to industry resulting from our entry would not havehad time to take much effect. Joining the e.c. would therefore be likely to useup a substantial part of the balance of payments surpluses shown in our projectionsfor 1970-72, and could also lead to further pressure on the already reduced rateof increase in consumption.27. The implications of our projections for the industrial structure of the economy, for the regional pattern of development, and for manpower, are still being examined and will be the subject of a further report. We have not taken credit forthe effect of the Regional Employment Premium; but we estimate that its introduction at 30s. a week per man in the development areas would lead to anincrease in the GDP in the period up to 1972 of up to about 0-1 per cent a yearwithout adverse effect on the balance of payments.CHAPTER II.   PRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL, unemployment and OUTPUT28. One of our main tasks has been to estimate the possible rate of growth of &quot; productive potential&quot; i.e., the rate at which output could grow at a constant pressure of demand. This is in effect the rate of growth as determined by the size of the labour force, the prevailing growth of efficiency and productivity in the economy, the stock of capital and other basic physical factors. The actualmovement of output from year to year may differ from this, a faster rise beingassociated with falling unemployment and a slower rise with increasing unemployment.
29. Changes in productive potential may be considered in several parts. Firstthere are changes in the growth of output per man-hour this is largely an assumption as our knowledge of the factors affecting it is inadequate to enable areliable forecast to be made. Then, there is the growth of the labour force, whichcan be forecast with reasonable accuracy. Finally, there are a number of factors,such as hours worked per week, holidays per year, and age composition of the labour force, which can be estimated and for which some rough and ready allowance canbe made.Output per man-hour30. The future growth of output per man-hour is not inexorably determined.It depends on the pace of technological advance, the rate of investment in new capital, economies of scale, the growth of managerial efficiency, training and education and other similar factors. All these depend in the main on decisions by individual people and organisations, although these decisions are to some extentcapable of being influenced directly or indirectly by Government action and by thework of such bodies as the National Economic Development Council (NEDC),the Economic Development Committees and so on. Indeed, Government actionto influence the future rate of growth represents one of the most fundamentalaspects of its economic policy.31. The effects of such action are, however, extremely difficult to quantify.Partly for this reason any assessment of the future growth of productivity is boundto consist largely of projecting past trends, modified by a broad judgment as to how the future may differ from the past.32. There is always some uncertainty about measuring past trends in productivity because the rate of growth of productivity has tended to vary with changes in the pressure of demand, and there is room for some difference inapproach in removing these cyclical influences. It is, however, now common ground that in the period 1960-65 output per man-year over the economy as a whole was rising at a trend rate of between 2-5 to 2-7 per cent a year. Output perman-hour was rising rather faster, probably 2-8 to 3-0 per cent a year, becausehours of work were falling and holidays getting longer.33. One respect in which the industrial environment is expected to differ infuture from the past is the existence of a continued higher level of unemployment.In the short run the rise in unemployment has clearly had an adverse effect on business confidence, but the long-run effects are more difficult to assess. On theone hand higher unemployment may have an inhibiting effect on the attitude oflabour towards removing restrictive practices and other measures to improveproductivity. A permanent easing of the shortage of labour would also removesome of the pressure on management to invest in labour-saving equipment. Onthe other hand the greater competitive pressures involved in running the economyat a lower pressure may in the long run have beneficial effects on productivity.34. Whatever may be the effects of higher unemployment, however, there aregrounds for assuming some acceleration in productivity in future. The main reasonis the more favourable trend in the age structure of the working populationdiscussed in paragraphs 40 to 43 below. The second, and more uncertain, is thatthe work of the Government, the NEDC and other bodies to this end might reasonably be expected to have some significant effect in the longer term.35. Our main estimate of the future growth of productivity has been calculated by taking the past trend of productivity (measured in output per man-hour) as a starting point and adding an allowance for the more favourable trend in the age structure of the working population. We have also considered a set of estimates embodying an acceleration in this rate of increase. This acceleration was assumed to be at the rate of 0-2 per cent a year from 1968 onwards, leading to a difference in the increase in output per man-hour of 0-8 per cent in 1972 betweenthe two cases.* (For 1968 we have used throughout the estimates made for the short-term forecasts.)The labour force36. One of the fundamental differences between the outlook for the next five years and the experience of the recent past is the change in trend of the labour* The detailed figures, together with various adjustments made to them, are shown in Table II 3below.SECRET7979 b
force. Between 1960 and 1965 the working population increased by an averageof 0-8 per cent a year. In 1966 and 1967 there will have been further increasesthough at a slower rate. From 1967-70, however, the working population isexpected to show a slight fall, and in each of the years 1971 and 1972 it is expectedto decline appreciably.37. The forecasts for the total working population used here take accountof the expected effect of revisions to the population projections. These revisionswill be available about the middle of this year. They will incorporate newassumptions about migration movements, the effect of which is expected to be toreduce the forecast working population in 1972 by some 180,000 (0-7 per cent)below that shown in the projections published last November. The new projectionsare likely to show a total fall of some 430,000 in the working population between1967 and 1972, with more than three-quarters of the reduction occurring in 1971and 1972.38. There are three main reasons for the change in trend from an increasinglabour force to a declining one:(i) the relatively low birth rate between 1950 and 1957;(ii) the raising of the school-leaving age in 1971;(iii) a net loss from migration.   (Whereas over the period 1960-65 netmigration movement added some 65,000 people a year (includingnon-workers) to the total United Kingdom population, the revisedprojections will assume an average annual loss of 30,000 people bymigration between 1967 and 1972.)39. The first two factors will reduce the number of young entrants into thelabour force; but the change in the trend in the adult working population is likelyto be much less marked. This is important in assessing the impact on productive potential, since it seems reasonable to assume that during the first few years oftheir working life new recruits from school have a lower productivity than adults.40. Table II 1 shows the relative changes in the number of young and adultworkers on the basis of last year&apos;s projections (an age distribution of the revised estimates is not yet available). Between 1967 and 1972 the number of young people in the labour force is expected to fall sharply; the rate of decline will be highestbetween 1970 and 1972, but there will be substantial reductions even before 1970.This is in contrast to a rapid increase in the number of young workers in recentyears. On the other hand up to 1970 the rate of increase of adult workers isexpected to be much the same as in the past; and this section of the labour force is expected to continue to expand, although at a slower rate, even in 1971 and1972. It is unlikely that the revised projections will radically alter the generalpicture, but the absolute numbers will of course be different.TABLE II-1Under 20      ......20 and over   ......Total (November 1966)Revised total (June 1967)Changes in the Composition of the Labour Force 1960-72(November 1966 estimates)1960-65 1967-70Thousand   per cent per annum.....      +415 + 30......

It is difficult to make allowances for differences in the productivity ofthe various groups of workers but a calculation has been made on the roughassumption that this is in proportion to earnings (of those over and under 20,males and females, and allowing for the fact that many married women workpart time). Applying this weighting to the labour force projections produces an&quot; age-composition-adjusted &quot; labour force which increases slightly to 1970, anddecreases slightly between 1970 and 1972. The table below shows the projectionsfor the actual and adjusted series. The broadly constant &quot; adjusted &quot; labour forceover the whole period compares with a fall of 0-S per cent a year in the figuresunadjusted for age composition. Over the period 1960-65 the &quot; adjusted &quot; labour
force, however, increased 0-3 per cent a year more slowly than the unadjustedfigures. Thus the &quot; adjusted &quot; labour force still shows a change in trend but thechange is 0 - 5 per cent a year smaller than that in the actual labour force.TABLE II-changes in Labour ForcePer cent a year1960-65   1966   1967    1968    1969    1970    1971    1972   1967-72Change in actual^) labour force   .........      0-8      0-3   e**0-1    0-1    -01   -0-2   -0-4   -0-9    -0-3&quot; Adjusted&quot; labour force      0-5     4-S     0-4     0-3     0-2     0-1     -0-1   -0-4      -(*) Published figures provisionally adjusted for changed migration assumptions.42. It is, however, doubtful whether the effect on the growth of productivity of changes in the age structure are necessarily as great as these calculations would suggest. We have, therefore, adopted the arbitrary procedure of taking into accountonly half the difference between the actual and &quot; adjusted &quot; figures (rounded to the nearest 0-1 per cent) in arriving at our forecasts of output per head.43. The effect of doing this is shown in Table II 3. Whereas the actualgrowth in output man-hour in 1960-65 is estimated at 2-9 per cent, it is estimatedthat the increase would have been 3 -1 per cent had it not been for an unfavourableshift in the age structure. Conversely while an increase of 3 -1 per cent might beexpected to continue in future if there were no change in age structure, the favourable changes in age structure forecast are expected to lift the actual rate of increase of output per man to 3 - 3 per cent a year.44. An adjustment to this forecast of output per man-hour has then to bemade for any likely changes in hours worked and holidays, in order to arrive atthe growth of output per man-year. Following the recent round of reductions inthe normal working week we have not allowed for further substantial reductions inthe length of the working week over the next five years. We have, however,assumed a further extension of paid holidays, so that most workers get three weeksby 1972 as compared with an average at present of about two weeks, two days.This, combined with only a small reduction in the working week, would mean thataverage hours worked per year would decrease by about 0 - 2 per cent a year over this period. This reduces our estimate of the future growth of output per man-yearto an average of 3 -1 per cent a year.45. With the acceleration of the underlying trend of output per man-hourassumed in the higher productivity projection, we get the rate of increase of output per man-year rising to 4-0 per cent a year in 1972 and averaging 3-6 per cent ayear in the period 1968-72.7979

Productive potential46. Combining the assumptions discussed above for output per man-yearand changes in the labour force, we get the following estimates of the growth of productive potential.TABLE 11-4Growth of Productive PotentialPer cent a year1960-65      1969       1970       1971       1972      1968-72Labour force............      0-8       -0-1      -0-2      -0-4      -0-9       -0-4Output per man-yearAssuming:Trend productivity      ......&quot;\   , ,       J3-1 3-1         3-1 3-2 3-1Higher productivity     ......J   /,D       \3-3        3-5        3-7        4-0 3-6Productive potentialAssuming:Trend productivity ......\   , .        f3-0        2-9        2-7        2-3 2-7Higher productivity ......J \3-2        3-3        3-3        3-1 3-2Note: In the latest short-term forecast the growth of productive potential is estimated as follows:1966        1967         1968Per cent increase      .........      2-9 3-1 3-0These figures have been used in this report for these years.47. On the trend productivity assumption the changed trend of the labour force leads to a slowing down in the rate of growth of productive potential whichis particularly marked in 1971 and 1972. On the higher productivity assumption,however, the acceleration in the rate of growth of productivity rather more thanoffsets the decline in the labour force and there is a slight acceleration in the growth of productive potential up to 1970 with a less sharp decline in 1972.Unemployment48. We have based our main projections on the assumption that unemployment is reduced to 1-75 per cent by 1970 and held there in 1971 and1972. We have, however, also looked at the consequences of assuming that unemployment is still at 2-0 per cent in 1970, but then is reduced to 1 -75 per cent by 1972. In the first case we assume that some mild reflationary measures keepdown unemployment in 1968 to an average of 2-0 per cent. In the second case we assume that unemployment in 1968 averages 2-2 per cent, as in the last short-termforecast.Output49. Combining our assumptions about productive potential with those forunemployment gives the output projections shown in Table II 5 below.TABLE II-5Unemployment and OutputUnemployment^).............

On the trend productivity assumption, output is expected to increase at an average rate of 3-5 per cent a year from 1967-70 with unemployment gradually falling to1-75 per cent. With unemployment at 2-0 per cent in 1970 the increase in output from 1967-70 would average 3-1 per cent a year. On the higher productivityassumption an average increase in output of 3-7 per cent a year from 1967-70would be associated with a reduction in unemployment to 1-75 per cent.50. Over the whole period 1967-72 output would increase at an average rateof 3 -1 per cent a year on the trend productivity assumption and 3-5 per cent onthe high productivity assumption.CHAPTER III.   BALANCE OF PAYMENTS51. The outlook for the balance of payments depends on the prospects for world trade and prices, on developments in the United Kingdom economy, andon Government policy.52. Examination of possible rates of growth of output in each of the mainindustrial countries over the next five years suggest that there is no reason to expect any major change in the past trend in output in the industrial countriestaken as a whole. In view of this we have assumed that the prices of manufacturedgoods exported by our main competitors will continue to rise slowly at much thesame rate as in the past.53. A review of the prices of the main groups of primary commodities hasnot suggested any clear expectation of change on average in one direction or another; hence it has been assumed that these prices will remain broadly stable.This is a major uncertainty in the forecast, especially as primary product prices have from time to time fluctuated sharply. However, there has been no cleartrend in the last 10 years or so and the expectation that world industrial production will increase at much the same rate as in this period supports the use of ourassumption of no change on average.54. Table III lbelow summarises briefly the balance of payments projectionfor the basic case (trend productivity, higher public expenditure) and for the higher productivity case. Detailed tables with unrounded figures for these and forthe alternative projections are in Tables A, B and C at the end of this report.TABLE III-1Balance of Payments SummaryC)  million		Trend Productivity				1968	1969	1970	1971	1972Visible balance        ...      ...      ...      ...      ....	-140	- 30	4-200	4-330	4490Invisible balance      ...      ... ;    .:.....      ...	4-250	+240	4-250	4260	4270Current account      ......     ...      ......	-4-110	+210	4-450	4590	4760Long-term capital    ...      ...........	-f 70	- 90	-240	-270	-290Identified balance     ...............	-1-180	+ 120	4-210	4320	4480Balance of monetary movements (4 favourable)(2)	4-230	+ 170	4-260	4370	4530		High	er Productivity		Visible balance        ...............	-140	- 80	4- 80	4-150	4260Invisible balance      ...............	+250	+240	4-240	4250	4260Current account      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...	+ 110	4-160	4-330	4400	4530Long-term capital    ...      ...      ...      ...	4- 70	- 90	-230	-250	-270Identified balance    ...      ...     ...      ....     ...	+ 180	4- 70	4- 90	+ 150	4260Balance of monetary movements (4- favourable)(2)	+230	4-120	4-140	4-200	4310Q) Central exports, high public expenditure.     (2) Including balancing item.United Kingdom exports55. The projections of world industrial production and commodity pricessuggest that exports from the industrial countries, both to each other and to the primary producers, should continue to increase at approximately the same rate
as in the past. The precise interpretation of this assumption, however, leavesroom for significant variations in the growth of world trade and British exports.Our main assumption is that the value of world trade in manufactures will growat about 9 per cent a year from 1966-72. This compares with an average growth of 9j per cent a year over the period 1960-65. This forecast assumes in effectthat there is no major interruption to economic growth in the United States or elsewhere, arising for example from a cut in United States defence spendingfollowing an end to the war in Vietnam. We have also examined the possible effects of a 1 per cent a year slower growth in world trade, i.e., 8 per cent a year from 1966-72.56. Our starting point in estimating United Kingdom exports of goods hasbeen to look at what might happen if United Kingdom costs moved, relativelyto our main competitors, as they have done in the past. Our exports to eachof the main world markets were then assumed to continue to grow on the sametrend from 1966-72 as they had over the decade 1956-66. This method of approachautomatically leads to a forecast of a faster rise in our exports in 1966-72 thanin the past decade, as the faster growing markets account for a higher proportionof the total. The 1972 figures arrived at by this method were treated as the basicprojection since our assumption of a 9 per cent per annum growth in world tradeis very close to the actual growth experienced in the past decade. Steady growthbetween the 1968 short-term forecast figure and this 1972 total was assumed forthe intervening years. In practice, of course, such a smooth path would not be attained.57. In the case of a world trade growth of 8 per cent a year this projection ofUnited Kingdom exports of goods in 1972 is reduced by about  150 million andproportionately smaller amounts in earlier years. (The slower growth of world trade would also affect adversely some of the other items in the balance ofpayments.)58. But if we could slow down the rate of increase in our costs we would do better than this. The outlook for costs is discussed in Chapter V below. Theconclusion there is that the combination of a somewhat reduced pressure of demand and of prices and incomes policy would lead to an appreciable slowing down inthe rate of increase of wages and salaries, and thus, given our assumptions on productivity, of costs. The possible extent of such an improvement is, however,difficult to estimate. Any improvement in productivity over past trends would improve costs provided the whole of the gain in productivity were not swallowedup in a correspondingly faster rise in money incomes. We have assumed here thatof the extra increase in productivity on the higher growth projections half wouldbe taken up by higher money incomes.59. An improvement in our cost performance would help exports partly by enabling exporters to charge lower prices than they would otherwise have done,and partly by making exports more profitable. Our main estimates, assuming trendproductivity growth, allow an extra  100 million increase in exports in 1972 for theeffects of improved costs compared with past trends. If costs rose \ Per cent more rapidly the value of exports would be reduced by around  50 million in 1972.Higher productivity would also affect costs; it is estimated that export performancewould be improved on this account by about  50 million in 1972 on our higher productivity projection.60.   The export figures thus arrived at are shown in Table III 2 below.TABLE III-2Exports and Re-Exports of Goods(trend productivity)Balance of payments basisIncrease in value1972 1966-72  million per centProjection of trends        ............... fi- improvement m costs compared with past     .......^105 i&amp;iBasic projection    ............ &apos; &apos;- change if growth of world trade 1 per cent per annum &quot;lower &quot; -&apos;l 50 n&apos;l- change if   per cent faster growth in costs     . ^ lr] o .- change for higher growth in productivity &quot;&apos; ,50 , q
Imports61. The growth in the volume of imports is dependent largely on the growth of domestic output and expenditure, but also on the movement of relative costs and other competitive factors here and overseas. Table III 3 below shows asummary of the forecasts for imports. Projections have been made for the fourmain groups, namely food, drink and tobacco, fuels, industrial materials and finished manufactures. The improved cost assumption affects mainly imports of manufactures. The 1966 base figure includes the effect of the Temporary ImportCharge, but provisional estimates suggest that this may have reduced imports byabout  100 million in that year, so that about I per cent per annum of the growth in imports to 1972 is attributable to the depressed level in 1966.62. As Table III 3 indicates, the forecast increase in the volume of importsfrom 1966-72 is 3-7 per cent per annum when GDP grows by 2-8 per cent perannum in the same period, and 4-1 per cent per annum with the higher growthassumptions of GDP rising at 3-2 per cent per annum. Import prices as a whole are expected to show a net increase of \ per cent a year from 1967-72, almostentirely the result of rising prices of finished manufactures: the prices of otherimports are assumed to be generally unchanged.63. The forecast for food, feed, drink and tobacco imports is based on an assumption of a growth in population at much the same rate as in the past, but with personal consumption increasing more slowly even in the higher growth case,However, because of the low income elasticity of demand of food consumption,this will not have a great effect on demand. Home agricultural production is assumed to rise in line with the programme for selective agricultural expansion sothat most of the increase in demand for temperate foodstuffs is met out of UnitedKingdom production, and the increase in food imports is mainly attributable totropical foods and other foods that cannot be produced at home. A fairly rapidrate of growth of drink imports is assumed. Tobacco imports were at anunusually low level in 1966 because of the Rhodesian situation, and are expectedto rise relatively quickly to 1968, with a slower rate of growth thereafter. It is assumed that a number of commodity agreements will help to stabilise food import prices. The Wheat Agreement arranged in the Kennedy Round proposes that theprice range for wheat shall be raised moderately, with the new minimum still alittle below the prices ruling in the last few years. In total, prices in this categoryare assumed to rise very slightly.64. Fuel imports have been estimated from calculations of total energydemand associated with the two growth rates, together with assuirnDtiorj^Jon energypolicy, natural gas availability and United Kingdom refinery bafflfaffibonsistentwith the picture emerging from the current review of fuel policy. In particular,it has been assumed that taxes on oil products will continue at their present levelduring the period and that continued assistance will be provided to coal by, forinstance, continuing the preference given to it in power stations. It is difficult toestimate the availability of North Sea gas at this stage, and the estimates are under constant review; but it has been assumed in this exercise that in 1972 the gasavailable will be equivalent to about 16 million tons of oil, compared with totaloil demand (excluding natural gas) in the trend productivity case of 112 million tons.  Coal demand is assumed to continue to fall rapidly.65. These considerations have led to a forecast of a steady increase incrude oil imports and a sharp decline in imports of petroleum products to a smallfigure by 1972. Product values are expected to fall, but crude values to remain unchanged from 1968 onwards. As a result the value of fuel imports is expectedto rise only about half as fast as in the past.66. The forecast for imports of industrial materials is related to manufacturingproduction and stock building. The forecast is for a rate of growth much in line with the past, in spite of slower growth of output; this is partly because of the increasing proportion of the faster growing semi-manufactures in the total for industrial materials. Import prices for this category were assumed to fall slightly in the short-term forecast, and have been taken to remain unchanged in thefollowing years. This is one of the important uncertainties of the forecast. Ifimport prices did not follow the level course assumed, it would be largely in imports of industrial materials (and food) that marked divergences from the forecast values would appear.

67. Among the main groups of imports, finished goods have shown by far the fastest rate of growth in post-war years. Between 1951 and 1966 imports ofcapital goods (about two-thirds of the total) and consumer goods have both on average doubled over each period of five years, but with some suggestion of slightlyslower relative growth (apart from the effect of the temporary import charge) inthe latest years.68. The forecasts for imports of finished goods have been obtained primarily by relating the volume of imported capital goods to fixed investment and importsof consumer goods to consumers&apos; expenditure. With markedly slower growth in both capital expenditure and consumers&apos; expenditure than in the past, there is some uncertainty as to whether past relationships will apply. For capital goods,past relationships have been assumed to hold and imports in the high growth case have been projected at about three-quarters of the recent rate of growth. the forecast for capital goods (excluding ships and boats, aircraft and aero engines)allows for a steady rate of growth in the import ratio at about the average rate ofthe past. Imports of ships and boats, which are forecast separately, are expectedto fall after 1968 as one of the major company&apos;s tanker programme passes itspeak, and the new shipbuilding credit scheme aids United Kingdom shipyards.In forecasting imports of consumer goods a somewhat faster rate of growth hasbeen assumed than the past relationship would suggest, given much slower growth in consumer spending. Prices of imports of finished manufactures have been assumed to rise at much the same rate as in the past.69. Imports would be rather higher on the low public expenditure assumptionthan on the high public expenditure assumption. This is because public expenditure at home uses resources with a low import content, whereas personal consumption, which would replace the cuts in public expenditure, has a much higher import content. However, in so far as specific cuts are made in netGovernment overseas expenditure the balance of payments is correspondinglyimproved.Other items70. Net invisibles are expected to show a marked improvement between 1967and 1968 (from -t-  137 million to 4-  253 million) because of a reduction in military expenditure and an increase in oil receipts. Thereafter net invisibles as a wholeshow only a slight improvement. An important element in the figures is the relativestability of Government expenditure overseas based on a continuation of currentpolicies. This is in marked contrast to the very rapid rise in such expenditure inrecent years.* The projections for private invisibles, on the other hand, comeclose to extrapolating past trends, except for net investment income where tax and Exchange Control measures will have progressively adverse side-effects on earnings.71. It is estimated that our net earnings would be reduced by  40 millionif world trade grew by 8 per cent per annum rather than 9 per cent as in the mainforecast. This would be reflected in, for example, lower freight earnings by UnitedKingdom shipping.72. Excluding transactions on United States aircraft the outflow of officiallong-term capital is not expected to show much change over the next five years.The private capital account is projected to show some deterioration, partly because some relaxation of current restrictions has been allowed for. The inflow of capital for investment in natural gas and oil refineries is expected to decline from the peaklevels due to be reached this year and next.73. Purchases of United States military aircraft affect the balance of payments in two stages: the payments on account of the aircraft and the borrowing andrepayment of the associated credits. These two parts of the transactions and theirnet impact on the balance of payments are shown below:- TABLE III-4IIS.

Overall balance of payments74. The estimates for the balance of payments on our main assumptions are shown in Table III 1 above. Estimates on the alternative assumptions forproductivity, public expenditure and world trade are shown in Tables at the end.75. In the period up to 1970 the balance of payments seems likely to continueto limit our ability to make full use of our productive resources. Assuming the trend growth of productivity, a gradual reduction of unemployment to 1-75 percent by 1970 would involve balance of payments surpluses averaging rather over 200 million a year from 1968-70, i.e., a total of about  650 million.* This wouldbe just sufficient to cover the outstanding debt after the end of this year of  514million but would not allow significant scope for recoupment of any of the earlierdebt repayments met out of our reserves; nor would it allow anything to covercontingencies or fluctuations; or to increase reserves or pay off sterling balances.If, however, unemployment were kept at 2 per cent up to 1970, the estimatedsurpluses would average over  300 million a year from 1968-70.76. With a higher rate of growth of productivity, it would be more difficultto reduce unemployment without running into balance of payment difficulties. Thisis because in a comparatively short period of five years a rise in productivity wouldhave only a small effect on exports compared with the effect on output and thusimports. On our higher productivity assumption the estimated surplus falls toabout  100 and  150 million a year respectively in 1969 and 1970.77. Our main balance of payments forecasts, whilst assuming that the growth of productivity remains in line with past trends, also assumes that higherunemployment and prices and incomes policy will slow down the rate of increaseof money wages and salaries per head relative to our competitors. There can beno guarantee of this. If our labour costs per unit of output were to continue torise as rapidly as in the past, the balance of payments might be about  100 millionworse in 1970, i.e., it would reduce the surplus to about  150 million on the trendproductivity assumption and we should be in bare balance on the higher productivityassumption.78. A further major uncertainty in the balance of payments is the course of world trade. A mild setback sufficient to reduce the rate of growth of world trade from 9 to 8 per cent a year could reduce the United Kingdom balance of paymentssurplus in 1970 by about  100 million. Again the situation would be unsatisfactory.79. Thus the balance of payments situation up to 1970 seems likely to remainextremely precarious even with a continuation of unemployment in the region of 1-75 to 2 per cent. Any sudden burst of domestic demand similar to thoseexperienced in past cycles would make the balance of payments situation intolerable.80. This assessment assumes that some of the direct measures taken by theGovernment to improve the balance of payments remain effective: in particular the maintenance of net Government expenditure overseas at a constant level (in real terms) from 1968 onwards is assumed. This is an important reason for theimprovement on past trends. On the other hand, travel restrictions are assumed to finish at the end of 1968; so is the voluntary programme of restraint in investment in the Overseas Sterling Area; in addition, the administration ofthe control on investment in the non-Sterling Area is assumed to ease. while there are difficulties in maintaining the restrictions on private investment in fullforce, these precise assumptions are not necessarily appropriate in the light ofthe balance of payments situation forecast.81. The balance of payments projections for 1971 and 1972 are obviouslyeven more uncertain than those up to 1970. But if demand were kept in line withoutput, which itself will be growing more slowly both because of the falling labour force and because no slack will be taken up, the balance of payments should improvein these two years. On our main assumptions the surplus is estimated to rise from  250 million in 1970 to just over  500 million in 1972. With the leastfavourable combination of assumptions for the balance of payments (i.e., higher productivity and slower growth of world trade) the surplus in 1972 is put at ratherover  100 million. The years 1971 and 1972 are, however, to some extentexceptional. With the labour force growing again after 1972, the balance ofpayments situation might be more difficult.* All the balance of payments estimates in paragraphs 75 to 81 are based on high public expenditure programmes.SECRET7979 c 2
CHAPTER IV.   COMPOSITION OF NATIONAL EXPENDITUREPublic expenditure82. We have examined the implications both of maintaining present public expenditure programmes, and also of reducing the rate of increase in public expenditure so that public expenditure in 1970-71 does not exceed, at survey 1967prices, the total proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in January. Theestimates for &quot; present programmes &quot; are those based on a continuation of present policies, as submitted in the 1967 Public Expenditure Survey, plus the contingencyallowance of  250 million in 1970-71 and the allowance of  50 million for furtherprogrammes. For convenience we refer to these together as the high public expenditure programme. The low programmes are  714 million lower in total in1970-71 (at 1967 survey prices). An allowance has been included in the low public expenditure case for a net reduction of  45 million in Government overseas expenditure in 1970-71. This improves the balance of payments, but does notrelease any domestic resources for alternative users. The derivation of thesefigures is set out in more detail in the Table below.TABLE IV-public Expenditure Programmes, 1970 71  mil/ion(1967 Survey prices)1967 Public Expenditure Survey returns............ 15,314Contingency allowance      .................. 250Further programmes .................. 50Total, high programmes       ............ 15,614Chancellors target (low programmes)    ............ 14^00Cuts required........................ 71483. The 1968 figures (taken from the short-term forecasts) imply a shortfallof about  100 million. This shortfall is assumed to be steadily reduced year by year and entirely eliminated in 1971-72. On the other hand, the contingencyallowance added has been assumed to rise from  150 million in 1969-70 to 250 million in 1970-71 and 1971-72. The high expenditure figures for 1972 havehad to be extrapolated from those for 1971-72 and the low expenditure figuresfor both 1971 and 1972 are extrapolated from the 1970-71 figures. (Thus the1972 low expenditure figures are fairly arbitrary.)84. The year-by-year increases in current expenditure on goods and servicesand fixed investment by central and local government on these two programmes are shown in Table IV 2 below.

85. The increases in capital formation other than housing are chiefly dueto the main programmes of Roads, Education and Health and Welfare. Allprogrammes show a jump back on to trend in 1968-69 after the slowing down in1967-68. The steady rates of growth thereafter reflect the road programme tomeet the rapid growth in traffic, the special expenditure on schools anticipatingthe raising of the school-leaving age, and the hospital-building programme.Housing86. The high public expenditure programme assumes that 237,000 public authority houses will be completed in 1970. To reach the target of 500,000 houses in all, 263,000 private houses would need to be built. However, it appearedunrealistic to assume that this number of private houses would be built given therates of growth emerging from our figures for private consumption and the increasein real incomes. The figure of 263,000 would have involved, for instance, anincrease in private housing expenditure between 1968 and 1969 of 17 per cent at a time when personal consumption was being severely squeezed. A reductionof 25,000 has therefore been assumed giving a figure of 238,000 for both the trendand higher productivity cases. Were the 263,000 private houses to be built, andthus the target of 500,000 houses met, an additional  70 million gross fixed capital formation (at 1958 prices) would be required in 1970. Personal consumption would have to be reduced by about  100 million at current prices, requiring abroadly corresponding increase in taxation. The low public expenditure programme has been assumed to involve a reduction in the number of publiccompletions in 1970 from 237,000 to 212,500 (this is the lowest figure outlined in the Civil Estimates Review). The Table below is a summary of the 1970completions figures for the two different projections. We have taken figures for1970-71 similar to those for 1970.TABLE IV-housing Completions (United Kingdom)ThousandsPublic Private TotalTrend/higher productivity High public expenditure       ......       237 238 475Low public expenditure        ......       212 238 450Nationalised industries&apos; investment87. The nationalised industries&apos; investment programmes used here are thosesubmitted by the Boards for this year&apos;s review (except fdY electricity whereprovisional figures have been supplied by the Ministry of Power). The Boards were asked to prepare investment programmes on two alternative growth assumptions.It is not clear from the preliminary submissions whether the Boards have in factused the recommended growth assumptions, but there is no reason to believe theyhave used assumptions outside the range of those recommended. Only in the caseof electricity have we had an indication of the sensitivity of investment to the rateof economic growth, where the higher productivity case would add about  30million a year to the investment requirements. Following increases of 9 per centin 1967 arid 6 per cent in 1968 total investment by the nationalised industries is forecast to fall slightly in 1969 and to remain virtually level through to 1971.Investment then rises in 1972 to about the level reached in 1968. The flatteningout in the total programme seems plausible because of the particular circumstancesof the three dominant programmes (electricity, gas and telecommunications) wherethere has been a massive ordering and installation of new capacity to catch upon previous shortages, to allow for NEDC and National Plan growth rates and totake advantage of new technologies. Annex 2 at the end of this report describes thefigures in detail.Private investment88. It is extremely difficult to estimate on the one hand how private investment is likely to behave, and on the other how much investment is needed to make possible any particular rate of growth. For manufacturing we have taken figures which are intended to represent the amount of investment required to achieveeach of the alternative growth rates. There are considerable difficulties in establishing  satisfactory  statistical  relationships  explaining  the  growth  of
manufacturing investment in relation to output, but productive investment clearlyplays a crucial role in determining the growth of productive potential per man.It is important, therefore, to attempt to assess whether the amount of investmentlikely to be undertaken is adequate to sustain the given rates of productive potential.89. In the trend productivity case the amount of manufacturing investmentrequired over the period up to 1972 has been estimated to involve an increase of6-1 per cent a year from 1967 or 3-2 per cent a year from 1966. The requiredannual increase from 1966 is roughly in line with the trend increase over the last decade, but whether the total amount of investment required up to 1972 will be forthcoming depends very much on the speed of recovery from the presentinvestment recession.90. In the higher productivity case the amount of manufacturing investmentrequired represents an average annual increase of 7-2 per cent from 1967-72, or4-2 per cent a year from 1966. This is a high rate to be sustained over a period of six years, particularly as the short-term forecast up to 1968 shows a sharp dropfrom the 1966 level; the cyclical upswing in 1969 and 1970 would have to be large,though by no means unprecedented, in order to achieve the total desired. Whatis perhaps more doubtful is whether the continued high growth after 1970 is likelyto be achieved; the average annual increase required for the period from 1968is 9 - 2 per cent. In both cases investment by the steel industry is included in the totals for private manufacturing investment.91. Investment in distribution and other services in the past has also shown a marked cyclical pattern, although the amplitude is not as great as that for manufacturing. There has been a distinct change in trend in recent years. Therewas a rapid increase in investment over the period 1958 to 1964 partly as a result ofthe development of supermarkets and the extension of office buildings. This rapid increase would probably have fallen off to some extent through natural forces butthe change was ensured by the introduction in 1965 of building licences and office development control. The projections allow for this change in trend but assume that there is no restriction on building licences after 1967. The projections forthe trend productivity case require an average annual increase in investment bydistribution and other services, including construction, of 6 - 2 per cent a year from1967-72 and on the higher productivity case an average annual increase of 6-8per cent over the same period.92. The assumptions underlying the projections for private housing are described in paragraph 4 of this section. The remainder of private investment,consisting of miscellaneous small categories, has been projected largely in line withpast trends.93. The detailed investment projections, both public and private, are givenin tables D.1 to D.3 at the end of this report.Personal consumption94. Personal consumption is here taken as the difference between total output and the other claims on resources discussed above (including the balance ofpayments). The estimated growth of personal consumption (in real terms) on thetwo alternatives for productivity combined with each of the two public expenditure programmes is shown in Table IV 4 below. The outlook for personal consumptiondepends mainly on the rate of increase of output attainable and the level ofGovernment expenditure although the level of investment, the behaviour of theterms of trade and the size of the balance of payments surplus are also important factors.95. A combination of the trend productivity assumption and existing government expenditure programmes would leave room for an average rise in realpersonal consumption from 1967-70 of 2-4 per cent a year (as against an increasein GDP of 3 - 5 per cent a year). This is an improvement on recent experience: theaverage annual increase from 1964 to 1967 is estimated at only 1 - 3 per cent a year;but it is rather lower than the average rate of 3-0 per cent for the period 1957-66.If the full reductions of about  700 million needed to get to the low public expenditure programme were to be achieved, consumption would rise at an average rate of 3 - 2 per cent a year from 1967 to 1970.96. With the higher productivity projection there would be more resources available, some of which would be taken up by personal consumption.   These
additional resources are fairly small up to 1970, but would allow personal consumption to increase by 2-6 per cent per annum instead of 2-4 per cent perannum with the high public expenditure programme, and 3-4 per cent per annuminstead of 3-2 per cent per annum with the low public expenditure programme.97. A combination of slower growth of output from 1970-72 with more orless constant increases in other categories of expenditure, generally leads to a slowergrowth in personal consumption in these years. This slowing down in the rate of growth of personal consumption is more noticeable in the projections on the lowpublic expenditure programme since, having increased much more slowly in 1969and 1970, its rate of growth thereafter is not much less than on the main programme.This phenomenon is also much less sharp in the higher productivity projectionsbecause there is an increasing amount of resources available with the same public expenditure programme.TABLE IV-4Growth of Personal Consumption^)Per cent change over previous year or annual averageProductivityPublic expenditureTrend HigherHigh programme1968 .............    ...      ... 3-1 3-11969 .................. 2-2V1970 ............      ...... 2-1 2-61971 ...     ...     ...     ...... 2-2 3 01972...     ...      ...      ......      ... 1-1 2-4Average1967-70 ............... 2-4 2-61970-72 .........     ...      ... 1-6 2-71967-72 ............      ... 2 1 2-7 .Average consumption per head of population1967-70     ...     ...     ......... 1-6 1-81970-72     ............      ... 0-8 1-91967-72     ...     ...     ...     ...     ... 1-3 1-9Low programme1968 ... ...     ...     ... ...     ... 3-1 3 11969 ... ...     ...   &apos;  ... ...      ... 3-5 3-71970 ............. ...      ... 3 0 3-41971 ... ...     ...     - -..... 2-5 3-31972 ... .:.     ...     ... ...      ... 1-3 2-6Average1967-70 ............... 3-2 3-41970-72 ............... 1-9 3-01967-72 ............... 2-7 3-2Average consumption per head of population1967-70     ............... 2-4 2-61970-72     ......      ......... 1-1 2-21967-72     ............... 1-9 2-4AveragePersonal consumption 1957-66............      ... 3 01957-61     ............... 3-41961-66     ......      ...     ...     ... 2-7Personal   consumption   per head  of totalpopulation1957-66.......      ...      ....... 2-31957-61     ............... 2-81961-66     ............... 2 0(&apos;) Assuming mam export forecasts.SECRET
CHAPTER V.  INCOMES, COSTS, SAVINGS AND TAXATION98. There are two reasons for thinking that money incomes, and hence costs and prices, may rise more slowly in the next few years than in the recent past. one is the effort being made to establish an effective prices and incomes policy. Theother is the prospect of higher unemployment. The possible quantitative effects ofthese two factors is, however, difficult to determine. There is very little basis onwhich to estimate the possible efficacy of prices and incomes policy; it has seemedto us prudent not to take credit for a restraining effect on the rate of growth ofwages and salaries per head of more than \ per cent a year.99. Many studies have been made of the relationship between wage increases and unemployment in the past, and these suggest that the rise in wages has beenslower in periods following a rise in unemployment. But the experience of pastyears has been of fluctuating unemployment around an average of 1 - 6 per cent forthe last decade. This is not necessarily a reliable guide to the behaviour of wagesover the next few years if unemployment is consistently higher than in the past.Thus the continuously higher level of unemployment predicated for the future mayhave less effect in slowing down the rate of increase of wages and salaries than thetemporary periods of relatively high unemployment experienced in the past (when,for example, wage increases may have been deferred for short periods in anticipation of a future rise in demand).100. A factor likely to work in the other direction, however, is the changingstructure of the working population. The expected increase in the proportion of adult men in the labour force (with their higher earnings per head) is a factor leadingaverage earnings per head to grow faster than in the past. In looking at the effecton productivity of the changing structure of the labour force, it seemed appropriate to take credit for only half the estimated change. In the case of earnings where we know more definitely what the relative levels between different age and sexgroups are, there are stronger grounds for taking account of the full amount. Thefollowing estimates, therefore, include an extra 0 - 5 per cent per annum increaseabove what we would otherwise have projected.101. Taking into account these effects, we have adopted the following assumptions about the annual increase in money wages and salaries per head, andthe consequent estimates of labour costs per unit of output. Comparing ourforecasts for 1968-72 with what happened in 1960-65, we are expecting earningsper head to rise \ per cent a year slower, but labour costs to rise as much as 1 -1per cent a year slower because of the assumed faster rise in output per man-year(mainly on account of changes in the age structure of the working population).TABLE V-1Earnings and Labour CostsAverage increase per cent a year1960-65	1966	1967	1968	1968-725-8	5-9	3-8	6-5	5-53-3	5-0	1-2	3-3	2-25-8	5-9	3-8	6-5	5-73-3	5-0	1-2	3-3	2-0Trend productivityEarnings per headLabour costs per unit of outputHigher productivityEarnings per head   ......Labour costs per unit of output102. The full effects on savings and taxation will be the subject of a separate report, but the broad conclusions are already apparent.103. The slowing down in the rate of increase in wage costs per unit of output will be reflected in the prices of final expenditure. However, since export prices are determined more by the rates of growth of prices of competitors thanby domestic costs the improvement in costs is likely to be reflected only to a smallextent in the prices of exports; but the profitability of selling abroad relative toselling on the home markets should improve substantially.104. Several other important factors are also already fairly certain. a stable V 2 shows, the proportion of total resources available for personal consumption is forecast to fall between 1967 and 1972, the fall being greater inthe high public expenditure case.

The likely behaviour of personal savings up to 1972 has been considered.The savings ratio (personal savings as a proportion of personal disposable income)is not expected to rise above 8 per cent which is similar to the average rate overthe past few years. This estimate is to be regarded with caution because of the uncertainties surrounding the future trends of the components of personal savings.The level of savings would itself be influenced by changes in taxation, among many other factors difficult to quantify.106. On the assumption of an 8 per cent savings ratio, with trend productivity and with the high public expenditure programme there will have to be substantial increases in central Government tax rates above the present level. Our preliminaryestimates suggest that the increase in revenue required above that implied by theprojection of central Government taxes at current rates is likely to be of theorder of  500 million a year by 1970 rising to perhaps around  1,000 million by1972. Behind this calculation are a number of assumptions whose implicationsneed to be made clear.(i) The continuation of the existing system of local government finance impliesan increase in rate income not only on account of the expansion ofthe base due to additions and improvements to the stock of rateableproperties but also derived from a progressive rise in the rate poundageover the period of the projection.(ii) National  insurance  contributions   have  been  projected   as  risingappropriately in line with the periodical upratings of benefits to reflectincreases in average earnings.(iii) The system of projection for the yield of direct taxes on persons at current rates of tax and allowances necessarily implies that the real value of personal tax allowances will be eroded as the price.level rises.(iv) The increases in revenue required have been calculated after taking credit for the fact that public corporations&apos; trading surpluses are projectedas increasing steadily in absolute terms over the period. In 1972 theyare put at  350 million higher than in 1967.107. If the revenue from rates were assumed to rise less fast, or if the real value of personal tax allowance were maintained, or if the trading surpluses ofpublic corporations did not increase by the amount postulated, then the additional revenue required from increasing central Government tax rates above currentlevels would be correspondingly larger.108. On the other hand, with the low public expenditure programme no significant increase in tax rates is implied in 1972 and some decrease may bepossible in the intervening years.109. Taking the higher productivity assumption the taxation position remainsbroadly similar as for the trend case, with a substantial additional tax requirement in 1970 and 1972 if the high public expenditure is taken, and no such increase ifthe low public expenditure is assumed.110. These calculations, which are based on the existing system of taxationwhile prices and incomes are rising, imply a marked increase in the proportionof GNP taken in taxes even in the most favourable case. This could, in turn,reduce the projected savings ratio below 8 per cent. Allowing for the change in revenue requirements mentioned above, the proportion of the GNP taken by totalxevenue is likely to increase in each of the cases considered. The increase in the ratio of total revenue requirements to GNP, with trend productivity and highpublic expenditure programme is 3 per cent between 1967 and 1970 and over 5iper cent between 1967 and 1972; this provides a good indication of the scale ofthe adjustment needed in the tax field over the periods concerned.SECRET7979 D

Although the broad features of the medium term tax situation are reasonably clear, the examination and possible correction of the detail of the tax projections have not yet been completed. It is also necessary to confirm that the balance between saving and investment for the main sectors implied bythe present projections is plausible throughout the period. The results of this further work will be included in the later full report on the taxation implications of the present projections.112. This report has not examined the detailed implications for the growth of the economy which would arise if we were to become members of the e.c..It was necessary for the purposes of the calculations involved in constructing theprojections to start from a firm basis of assumptions and, although we have considered a number of alternative situations involving different growth rates andlevels of unemployment, there are a great many fundamental uncertainties involvedin the e.c. situation which make detailed calculations of its implications impossible at this stage. Our projections are to a large extent based upon past relationships,and since it is to be expected that membership of the e.c. will bring about changesin these relationships it would not be possible to adjust the figures as they nowstand so as to indicate the quantitative implications of membership. In additionto the difficulty of measuring what the effects of the United Kingdom membership would be there are the added uncertainties of timing, the course and content ofthe negotiations, and the possibility of measures which might be taken to offsetsome of the effects which could arise. Some of these issues will become clearer inthe course of the next few months.113. The paragraphs which follow note certain assumptions about the timing and effects of entry and about the outcome of negotiations. They are intendedto suggest some of the factors which should be taken into account in interpretingthe figures in this report in the event of our becoming members of the Community.However there are still many areas in which additional work will need to be donein order to assess fully the possible effects on the growth of the economy up to 1972.114. Because of the specific planning period which we are considering, thedate of our effective entry into the e.c., the timing of the effects of our entry, thelengths of the transitional periods and any other temporary or permanent arrangements which may be negotiated, are of considerable importance. If we assume for purely illustrative purposes that our membership were to become effective as from 1st January, 1970, then if there were, say, transition periodsaveraging about five years it would seem that only about half of the total impacteffects of membership might be felt. But this could be misleading for a number of reasons. Some of the effects may be anticipated (e.g., prices may be adjusted inadvance of tariff cuts and so begin to affect the flows of trade, or we may begin to make changes in our own domestic policies) while others may be delayed either because of built-in time lags or because of conditions emerging from thenegotiations.115. The balance of payments effects in the first two or three years of membership will depend very much on these &quot; leads and lags &quot; and on the terms of entry which can be negotiated, especially in the arrangements relating to agricultureand capital movements. The effects of tariff dismantling cannot be preciselyforecast, the Kennedy Round adjustments will need to be taken into account,the way in which Commonwealth preferences might be removed cannot be foreseen,CHAPTER VI.   ENTRY INTO THE e.c.
and much will depend on firms&apos; trading policies and on the general supply and demand conditions prevailing in the United Kingdom and in other european countries.116. So far as agriculture and capital movements are concerned, our negotiating objectives will be to secure adequate transitional periods and somemitigation of the anticipated balance of payments burden. We assume that these will be at least partially successful. If they are then the total balance of paymentscost of adopting the common agricultural policy will be reduced and the annualeffects in the early stages will be diminished. Also, if a period of progressivephasing out of restrictions on capital movements could be negotiated it wouldmean that there would be only minor adverse effects up to 1972, and these might indeed be offset by an additional inflow of capital.117. The effects of higher food prices on United Kingdom costs and prices would begin to operate from 1970 with some lag, the length of which would be influenced by the timing of the changes made in our agricultural arrangements. These effects,unless offsetting action were taken, would reduce the volume of exports, increaseimports, and imply a deterioration in the balance of payments outlook which isnow forecast. The favourable factors, such as the economies of scale due to alarger market and the general stimulus given to industrial development, would belonger-term and are unlikely to offset the unfavourable factors within the period under review. It would, therefore, be prudent to allow for a marked and progressiveworsening in the balance of payments from 1970-72, reaching perhaps a fewhundred million pounds by the end of the period and tending to increase for someyears thereafter.118. It is assumed that the prospect of entry into the e.c. will provide a stimulus to investment. This would mean that the recovery in private investment,which we now foresee as taking place in 1969 and 1970, would be brought forwardinto 1968 and that the boom thereafter would be both stronger and more sustained.If this were to happen it would involve an additional call on resources for whichroom would have to be made. This is very much a matter of conjecture at thisstage, and further work needs to be done in which regard will have to be paid tothe prospects for individual industries, the growth of output in the economy as awhole and also some analysis of the effects of the formation of the e.c. on investment trends in the Six.119. There is similar uncertainty surrounding the possible effects on productivity, and again further study on an industry basis will be required. It is assumed that, in the longer term, changes in the industrial structure would have a beneficial effect but whether and to what extent there would be a significantimprovement within this planning period, and before any structural changes had occurred, is an open question. It is unlikely that it would be large until the latter part of the period in any case.120. Whatever may be the total effects on investment and productivity in both the medium and longer term, it is clear that individual industries will bedifferently affected and that this will also be reflected regionally, both in manufacturing industry and agriculture. While this does not directly affect ourprojections at this stage (although it could be relevant to the balance of payments),it could have a considerable influence on the next stages in our economic planning.It is an area in which a great deal more work will have to be done both at aneconomic and statistical level.121. To sum up therefore we would foresee after 1970 a deterioration in our balance of payments due to entry which, even if moderately favourable terms werenegotiated in respect of agriculture and capital movements, could use up a large part of any surpluses which developed on the lines now forecast. While any increase in private investment which took place would be very welcome from aproductivity standpoint, this would represent an increased demand on resources.An offsetting factor would be any gains in productivity which occurred as a resultof membership. The way in which such a shift in resources might be brought aboutwould affect the implications for savings and taxation, which would in turn beaffected by movements in prices. We have not so far attempted to assessquantitatively these implications for our present projections.SECRET7979 D 2
CHAPTER VII.  REGIONAL EMPLOYMENT PREMIUM122. Our estimates have not taken into account the decision to introduce a regional employment premium. This decision should make it possible to achieve a slightly higher national output without running into balance of payments difficulties or excess pressure of demand.123. The estimation of the effects of the regional employment premiuminvolves a complex set of considerations and many uncertainties. On one set ofassumptions, which includes the assumption of only a moderate leakage into wages,it has been estimated that the extra premium of 30s. a man per week in theDevelopment Areas might reduce the present disparity between unemployment inthe Development Areas and in the country as a whole by one-half over the courseof three to five years. The introduction of this premium without any other changesin taxation would be expected to reduce unemployment in the Development areas by about 1 per cent over three d five years, and to increase unemployment elsewhereby up to 0-1 per cent. It is Jso estimated that the net effect on the balance ofpayments is unlikely to be adverse and might be favourable up to a maximum of around  40 million.124. If the balance of payments effects of the premium were neutral, outputcould be permitted to rise over a period of three to five years by rather over  100million (1966 prices) above what it would otherwise have been. This would be equivalent to an addition to the annual rate of rise of output of 0-05-0-1 per cent.With a more favourable balance of payment outturn either because the premium&apos;seffects were definitely favourable or because the balance of payments was for other reasons no longer a factor limiting output it might be possible to allow output torise by up to a maximum of  250 million, since taxes could be reduced without increasing the pressure on costs and prices outside the Development Areas. this could give an addition to the annual rate of rise of output as high as 0 - 2 per cent.This latter is an outside estimate because the net effect of reducing unemploymentin the Development Areas and keeping unemployment constant elsewhere would add somewhat to the pressure of demand on the economy, and it might be necessaryto stop short of this point.125. While the introduction of the regional employment premium wouldnot radically alter the outlook for the economy, particularly in the difficult period up to 1970, the marginal addition to our resources which it would make availablewould be very useful.

In order to arrive at the total other than housing included in Table IV 2it is necessary to add in the other, small, parts of public authorities&apos; investmentclassified to industries other than public services, to allow for purchases of land,and to adjust the figures for the expected short-fall in 1967 and 1968 and for later years, although on a diminishing scale (see paragraph 2 of Part IV).ANNEX nationalised INDUSTRIES&apos; investment . The figures in the Table to this Annex are based on preliminary returnsfrom the nationalised industries setting out their investment requirements for the1967 Investment Review. However, in the case of electricity no submission has yet been received from the Electricity Council and the figures in the Table areMinistry of Power estimates. For each of the programmes substantial changesmay be made during the Investment Review over the next three months, but wehave not anticipated any adjustments.2. Earlier this year the nationalised industries were sent Planning Guidelinesrecommending economic growth assumptions not significantly different from the trend and higher productivity cases in the present MTAC exercise. It is not clear from the preliminary submissions from the nationalised industries whether theyhave used the Planning Guidelines, but there is no reason to believe that anyBoard has taken an economic growth assumption outside the range of the PlanningGuidelines. Only in the case of electricity (which is one of the most sensitiveprogrammes to changes in GDP) has there been an indication of the sensitivity of investment to the rate of economic growth and it is estimated that, compared withthe trend productivity case, the higher productivity case would add about 30 million a year to electricity investment requirements.3. In order to provide an asset breakdown of these programmes for inclusion in the projections in this report, deflators were applied to convert the individualasset figures to a 1958 price basis. During the rapid growth of the electricity andGPO investment programmes in recent years each has experienced a slippage ofthe programme. An allowance of  33 million in 1967 falling to  6 million in 1969(at 1967 prices) has been made for continuing slippage during the remaining period.ANNEX public AUTHORITIES&apos; INVESTMENTTables D.1 and D.2 at the end of the report give details of investment by industry and whilst the public authorities component is to be found largely under&quot; Public Service &quot; investment it is not possible to distinguish the main publicprogrammes. For ease of reference, therefore, the following table is included to illustrate the contribution of the main components of the public expenditure survey.Public Authorities Gross Fixed Capital Formation included in Public Services
4. As explained above the figures in the Table to this Annex are preliminarybids for 1967. On the basis of past experience, the range of uncertainty for theoutturn from 1970-71 onwards is estimated as 4- 200 million a year.5. Consideration has been given to whether the flattening out of the total investment in the later years is plausible and whether a contingency for under-estimation should be added. However, the flattening out seems plausible as thethree dominant programmes (electricity, gas, telecommunications) have allexpanded very rapidly indeed in recent years and it is not expected that this rateof expansion will continue.(a) Electricity: There has been a massive installation of new capacity to catchup on previous shortages and to allow for NEDC and National Plangrowth rates; but current load estimates, on which new investment plans are based, imply slower growth in electricity demand than forecastseveral years ago. There is thus a twofold effect due to lower growthestimates for the future and prospective over-capacity from pastdecisions.(b) Gas: Investment has increased rapidly in recent years to provide thenaptha reforming capacity to meet the fast growth in gas demand andovercome capacity shortages. Plans to switch to natural gas over thenext few years are entailing a large initial investment in pipelines, but should lead to a falling off in later years, due to the cessation of investment in the reforming plants.(c) GPO: Investment has increased rapidly to meet the recent fast rate of growth of the telecommunications system, including the demand for new connections, elimination of the waiting list, and the extension ofsubscriber trunk dialling, but on present indications there will be nofurther upsurge of investment in the forecast period.Nationalised Industries Fixed Investment in the United Kingdom(l)(  millions at 1967 Review prices)		1967-68	1968-69	1969-70	1970-	71	1971-721.
