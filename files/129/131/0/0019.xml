C(67) 1194th July, 1967CABINETFAR EAST DEFENCE:  CONSULTATIONS WITH THE&quot;GOVERNMENTS OF AUSTRALIA,, NEW ZEALAND,MALAYSIA AND SINGAPOREMemorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth AffairsDiscussions were held during June with the Governments ofAustralia, New Zealand and Singapore.      Consultations with the PrimeMinister of Malaysia will start on 5th July.2.     As approved by the Cabinet (CC(67) 34th Conclusions) the Juneconsultations were held on the basis that we should make clear to our allies that we planned to run down our forces in the area by about one half by 1970/71 and to give up our bases on the mainland of South east asia by the mid-1970s and that we also planned to retain a military capability for use, if required, in the Far East after 1975.    I attach the records of the Prime Minister&apos;s meetings, which summarised and brought to a conclusion the discussions held with each Government.Views of C commonwealth Governments3,      While showing understanding of our need to make reductionsover the next few years, our Commonwealth allies argued against ourtaking any decision now to leave the mainland of Asia by 1975 or to ouradopting this as our sole planning assumption.    If nevertheless we took any such decision now they were emphatically opposed to ourcommitting ourselves to a date in any public announcement.     The pointsthey made were -(i)    It is too early to take decisions now on our defenceposture in the mid-1970s, especially while theVietnam war continues.    We should retainflexibility in our planning, keeping the optionsopen until the situation is clearer in, say, threeyearsr time.-1The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of.......................................... &quot;TOP SECRET - copy No..........k.*r
(ii)    To decide on our withdrawal while the countries concerned still wish us to stay would be contraryto the 1966 Defence White Paper and other recentMinisterial public statements, and would be needlesslyputting at risk all Britain had built up in Malaysia and singapore, especially during the last twenty years of resistance to Communism,,(iii) A decision on total withdrawal by 1975, especially if announced, would give immense encouragement to the Communists in Hanoi and Indonesia as wellas in Malaysia and Singapore.     We should lay thearea open to hostile influences, and pressureswould develop for an even earlier withdrawal.(iv) The announcement of a decision to withdraw by a firm date would lead to a collapse in confidence,the loss of substantial British investments and the diversion of sterling balances]  in particularLee Kuan Yew stressed that in Singapore hisregime and all he stands for would be at risk; we might well therefore find it impossible to withdrawin an orderly fashion.conclusions.      During the June consultations we were successful in bringingour Commonwealth allies a long way towards acquiescence in our plans.     Our disclosure that we were prepared to maintain a continuing military capability for use in the Far East was particularlyhelpful.    But they remained entirely opposed to a public announcementof any early date for withdrawal which they were convinced would bring the consequences set out under (iii) and (iv) above,    I am boundtherefore to report to my colleagues that my assessment is that theco-operation of our Commonwealth allies is essential if we are to achieve the desired savings through an orderly withdrawal; and that  /e shall not be able to secure their co-operation unless(a) we avoid announcing 1975/76, let alone any earlier date,as a firm date, even as a planning assumption, for our withdrawal from our mainland bases;(b) we announce our intention to maintain a continuingmilitary capability for use in the Far East after our withdrawal from our mainland bases.Withdrawal by 1970/ 715.      I have just seen the Lord Presidents paper (C(67) 116) inwhich he suggests that consideration be given to complete withdrawal by 1970/71.   It is difficult to exaggerate the effect of such a timetableon our relations with our Commonwealth allies, since we assured themthat the consultations we were having with them would be meaningfuland that we would take their views into account in coming to final decisions.    If, after consulting them on the basis of withdrawal by1975/76, and hearing their arguments against this, we were to decide to withdraw by 1970/71, they would with reason feel that they had been taking part in a meaningless charade.
6.      The Commonwealth countries concerned would certainlyaccuse us of bad faith and there would be bitter recrimination in allfour countries.    Singapore, in particular, would find it impossibleto cope with such a timetable which would bring economic disasterand her future alignment would almost inevitably be affected.    Thewhole political pattern of South East Asia would be thrown intouncertainty.H. W. B.Commonwealth Office, S. W. 1.4th July, 1967-3.
present prime Minister Mr. MarshallMr. A.M. Palllser Mr. MoriartyMr. MillerAfter dealing with Britain and the E.E.C.  (recorded separately) the discussion turned to British Far east defence Policy.    Mr.i Marshall expressed Mr. Holyoakefsgratitude for the Prime Ministers invitation to discuss this with him.    But Mr. Holyoake had his Budget Dehateand had asked Mr. Marshall to raise this matter&quot; on&quot;behalf of the New Zealand Government.ThQ Prime Minister explained the economic &quot;burdenof our overseas commitments, the need to reduce imports in order to maintain a &quot;balance of payments surplus;    andthe difficult social and economic problems caused &quot;bydeflationary measures which in themselves appeared to achieve disproportionate import savings having regard tothe size of our overseas expenditure, which was still at anexcessively high rate.    Mrv jfajpslialjl said he understoodthis.    The New Zealand Government did not object to our need to reduce the size of our forces.   But they weregravely concerned at the possibility of total withdrawal.The Prime Minister said that he had discussed this with President Johnson and would be doing so withMr. Holt.    Our intention was to retain a military capability in the area whereas Australia, New zealand and the United States wished us to keep a foothold on the/mainland.I RECORD OF A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER AND&apos;   THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER OP NEW ZEALAND AT  10, downing street AT 6.30 p.m.  ON MONDAY, JUNE 12
mainland.    But such footholds were disproportionatelyexpensive.    Mr. Marshall agreed.    But Singapore was inone sense New Zealand&apos;s front line.    They could not staythere unless Britain did;    and it should surely &quot;be possibleto reduce substantially but not completely.    In particular they hoped that a small Commonwealth force could beretained in Singapore.   As long as Britain was there,she could rapidly re-inforcc in a crisis;    but when she had gone,  even with the necessary capability to re-inforce,it might prove impossible to do so without an existingfoothold.    The Prime Minister said that even a smallfoothold entailed a totally disproportionate expenditureon infra-structure, stores and troops to protect the stores and infra-structure.   We had been examining anumber of alternative options, including the maintenanceof what might become a civilian dockyard in Singapore andcertain &quot;fall-back&quot; facilities in Australia.    Mr. Marshallsaid he could not, of course, speak for the AustralianG-overnment but believed they would accept this if Britainmaintained a small front line capability in Malaysia.   he urged re-consideration of the concept of a small Commonwealthforce on the mainland.   Neither Australia nor New zealand had a large enough capability to maintain such a force ontheir own;    but they could do it in co-operation with britain.The Prime Minister said, that another problem was thatcertain of our Asian friends were slow to help themselvesif they knew that they would be protected by British troops.Singapore and Malaysia also had serious differences.    our purpose should be to persuade them to co-operate more effectively without depending militarily on us.    Mr. Marshallagreed that this was necessary;    but renewed his plea for asmall continuing presence.    The Prime Mij^ster said that we/should
should not encourage Singapore and Malaysia to expect such apresence to continue indefinitely.    Moreover, there was considerable political uncertainty and it was difficult to predict the situation in Singapore in eight years time.Mr., Marshall said he thought Mr. Lee&apos;s position would hestronger if we stayed than if we left.The Prime Minister said that no final decisions hadbeen taken hy H.M.G.  since they had wished first to discussthe position with New Zealand and their other allies.Mr. Marshall said that the Commonwealth Strategic reserve and the Commonwealth Brigade had great value for Australiaand New Zealand as tangible evidence of the continuingassociation within the Commonwealth.    It was difficult to predict the future of the Commonwealth but he thought therewould always be a few of the original members who would wishto preserve the fundamental relationship that linked them.The Prime Minister agreed.    He was sometimes inclined to feel that the future of the wider Commonwealth would dependon our success in avoiding too frequent meetings of commonwealth Prime Ministers.    The 1966 meeting had been atraumatic experience for his colleagues and himself;    andhe had found it necessary to take a far tougher line than hewould ever normally wish in such a gathering.    Mr. Marshallsaid he understood this;    and that was not the kind of commonwealth that he had in mind.   He then reverted to thequestion of the Commonwealth Brigade and pleaded mostinsistently for it to be maintained, and for the currentplanning for its early rundown to he urgently re-examined.The Brigade was very meaningful for Australia and New Zealand;he hoped that H.M.G. would regard it as a link with those twocountries that should be preserved.The Prime Minister undertook to examine very carefullyeverything that Mr. Marshall had said.Mr. Marshall left at 7.30 p.m.
EXTRACTRECORD OP A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER ANDTHE PRIME MINISTER OP AUSTRALIA AT 10 DOWNING STREET AT10.2+5 AoM0 ON TUESDAY, JUNE 13, 1967Present;Prime Minister The Rt. Hon. Harold HoltMr. ArMo Palliser Sir John BuntingPar East defence Mr.. Holt said that Australia&apos;s concern at the proposedBritish policy for the rnid-70s was not primarily a matter of australian military security.     This was well protected &quot;by theANZUS Treaty (and, to some extent even through SEATO).   Moreover,the significance of Australian - U.S. relations was increasingall the time;    even in the field of investment, the Americansmust now be something near to the British figure of about 1,000 millionso     Moreover, there was a remarkable growth of American interest and investment in Asia generally;    andthis was equally true of Australia, whose exports East of Sueznow represented 50 per cent of their total exports, with Japanas a major factor.     This year, for the first time, japan had displaced the United Kingdom as Australia&apos;s largest export market.     Admittedly, the monejr value of Australia&apos;s exportsto Britain had increased, even though the percentage had fallensthey hoped that this situation would continue, subject toany consequence that might flow from eventual british membership of the E.E.C.Mr. Holt said that Australia&apos;s real concern was at thelong-term implications for the future security pattern of the region.     Taking an arc round the mainland from Japan, throughKorea, Taiv/an, the Philippines, Thailand, round to malaysia and Singapore, and including Australia and New Zealand, they/ere bound to note that the only part of the arc where therewas no American military commitment ?/as in Malaysia and/Singapore
Singaporea     The United States Government had always regardedthis as a Commonwealth - and indeed primarily a British -responsibility,,     In their talks with the President and withMessrso Rusk and MeNamara he and the Prime Minister, he knew,had both been told in the strongest terms of the great difficulties the Administration would face with Congress and american opinion generally if they were left in due course as theonly non-Asian power established on the Asian mainland,,   Thiswas also, he believed, the view of many of the Asian Governmentsthemselves.     Mr. Holt thought that the Defence Secretary had probably derived a misleading impression from his talks in singapore and Malaysia, especially the latter.     The Tunkuwas a calm and urbane character who perhaps took a slightlycomplacent view.     But Tun Razak undoubtedly felt strongly about what Mr. Healey had said to him.     The Prime Minister commentedthat Tun Razak&apos;s view had indeed been made very clear to us.Mr. Holt said that the same was true of the Prime Minister of singapore.     At the time Mr. Healey had spoken to him, Mr. Leehad been apprehensive lest public discussion-in Singapore of thismatter should lead inter alia to a fall-off in foreign investmentthere.     But he had privately expressed to the australian government his serious apprehension at British plans.Mr. Holt said that the Australian Government understoodand sympathised with Britain&apos;s problem.     As he had made clearon arrival in London, his purpose was not to &quot;twist the Britisharm&quot; but to find ways of meeting the legitimate concern felt by the Australian Government, and, he knew, those of New zealand and the United States.     They accepted that there must be a bigreduction in British forces in the area.     But they hoped that even in the reduction up to the 1969/70 period some flexibilitycould be retained in relation to the Commonwealth brigade.The Prime Minister said that the same point had been made tohim by Mr. Marshall8     Mr. Holt said that the people of the areaSECRET /attached
Iattached much importance to a continuing British presence..The Australian Government had told the United States Governmentthat they believed that British thinking in the long termwas much in line with American ideas for the period afterthe end of the Vietnam war0     But he had not found this viewaccepted in Washington, where it was argued that any Americandeparture, for example, from Korea, even after the end of thewar in Vietnam, would create a crisis in U0S./Korean relations0The United States Government had substantial defence facilities in Taiwan, the Philippines, Guam and Okinawa;    and they werebuilding up facilities in Thailand on a scale designed toprevent them finding themselves caught in a Vietnam situationthereo     He therefore considered that a continuing U.S.presence or the mainland could be assumed, for the foreseeablefuture9     Only if Thailand at some point found themselves theonly mainland country still with a U.S. presence might this ;situation changeo     But this was unlikely,,     In any case, theAustralian Government thought it vital to the security of thewhole area that the United States Government should have sufficient political and public support internally to be able tomaintain their military commitments and presence in AsiasThe Australian and New Zealand presence in Vietnam was marginalbut, as he had found in the United States, it was immenselyappreciated there because the Americans like &quot;to have the supportof a friendly voice&quot;.     Similarly, the continuing Britishpresence, however small, would have a disproportionate value in this context.       As to the Common?/ealth brigade, he wasnot versed in the. technical arguments;   but he hoped thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government could keep enough flexibility in planning to maintain the possibility of continuing the brigade,even if substantial modifications in supply or logisticsmight be required./Mr0 Holt
Mr. Hclt said that as Australia (and New Zealand) grewin strength and in population, they accepted that they must play an increasing part;    as regards the shorter-term aspectsthey had always accepted that Britain would wish substantially to reduce her forces after the end of confrontation!    what was at present being done could of course be presented as entirels^in conformity with this purpose.     But the longer-term aspectwssmore difficult and disturbing,,     They naturally accepted that plans could and should be made to meet all eventualities.But to take definite decisions now seemed to contradict all the lessons of contemporary history and in particular that of theunpredictability of events - of which the Middle East had justfurnished the most recent examples     He accepted that the&quot;Vietnam problem might prove relativelv short-term.     the bombing must be hurting North Vietnam;    it suffice! to imaginethe consequences in Australia if all their power and industrialplants were being progressively eliminated.     The communistmentality5 as they knew, accepted abrupt changes in policy if aregime recognised that a given policy was unsuccessful.     he saw that Her Majesty&apos;s Government had a political problem athome and that it could seem advantageous to handle this byannouncing firm decisions as soon as possible.     But thosewho were pressing for this now would only press for somethingelse two months later if they received satisfaction^     Tlie^PrijneMinister said that there was some force in this;   many oi thosein Britain who v/ere most &quot;dove-like&quot; In relation to Vietnamwere &quot;hawk-like&quot; about the Middle East:    and the use ofnapalm in Vietnam was apparently judged more reprehensiblethan its use in Syria.     But Mr. Holt was mistaken in thinking that the Governments policy resulted from political pressures,,It was more soundly based than that.Mr. Holt said that, nevertheless, an early announcementof the policy would set off a chain of consequences.     Their
hope was that, although they themselves might have a clear idea of the outcome of British thinking, this could hepresented publicly in vaguer terms.     Could it not, for examplebe related to the need for substantial reductions, thedesirability of flexibility in dispositions and consequentlyto plan for a variety of possible options - it might even besaid that one of these might well have to be a complete withdrawal,from the mainland,&apos;   but that no final decision had been taken and that the Government would be keeping the position under constant review,,     A public British position on these lines would be very helpful to the Australian Government;    after theVietnam war was over, Australia and others might be able to doconsiderably more themselves.     The Prime Minister said he recognised that Vietnam dominated the sitxiation at present.Mr. Holt said that any unequivocal British statement now that britain would be off the continent of Asia by the mid-1970swould have a shattering effect on Commonwealth relations in thearea, on Australia and New Zealand in particular and generallythroughout the Par East.     The Australian Government could not understand the need to make such an announcement at this point.They believed it would also be damaging to Anglo-american relations - indeed his understanding was that the U.S.administration had told H.M.G. they would prefer British defencecuts to be made in Europe than East of Suez.The Prime Minister said that we had been willing to make further cuts in Europe0     But this also raised great difficulties with the U.S., as had emerged from our tripartitetalks about the German offset problem,,     They had expressedgreat corcern lest substantial British cuts should strengthen the isolationist pressures in the U0S. and the continuing demandfor cuts in U.S. forces in Europe.     On the general issue thePrime Minister repeated that British policy was not related to political or party pressures.     So far as the latter was concerned/there
there was considerable diversity of demand and purpose on thepart of those urging total withdrawal.     But, as he had  made clear after the Labour Party Conference the previous year, the government&apos;s intention was to govern.     There were, however,strong and legitimate pressures on the Government drasticallyto reduce overseas expenditure.     First, there we^e the very powerful economic arguments resulting from the essential need to keep our balance of payments in surplus.     The figures forthe first quarter of 1967 being published that day would revealsuch a surplus.   But excessively tough measurer, had been required from the Government, including measures of deflationwhich had resulted in a certain degree of unemployment.     Whencomparisons were made between the amount of deflation requiredfor only  50 million of import saving and overseas expenditureof about  500 million, it was clear that very convincingjustification of this overseas expenditure was needed.     Theeconomic argument, however, though strong was not necessarilyconclusive.      In this respect there was a certain analogywith our position in relation to the EoEoC. where the economic arguments for joining could be held to be finely balanced, butthe political arguments for doing so were decisive.     But, inthe present case the decisions involved derived from our whole concept of what our general defence posture should be0The Prime Minister said he wished to emphasise that no final decisions had yet been taken.   The Government had made It clear that they intended first to consult theirCommonwealth partners and the U.so     and Ministers had carriedout a further review of the matter before his visit to washington, and in the knowledge that he would thereafter beseeing Mr. Holt, Mr. Marshall and, in due course, the PrimeMinisters of Singapore and Malaysia.     They were prepared tosay that Britain would retain a military capability in theareaj    this meant, in practice, that we should retain certain/commitments
commitments and accepted (as was always our intention) that britain should not he isolated or cut off from the area.The Prime Minister recognised that this would not satisfyMr. Holt&apos;s desiderata: of a continuing British presence in singapore or on the Commonwealth &quot;brigade.     He would he asking the Defence Secretary to develop our arguments at greaterlength in the forthcoming plenary session;    and Mr. Healeywould he able to do this more effectively and in greater detail than he himself had done.     But one of the main problems was that of how to arrange a small but pffectivedeployment of forces without a vast and very costly infra-structure.     The Australians in Vietnam did not have this problem since they could depend on the American infra-structure.     But the problem would present itself in seriousform if there were any question of our trying to keep only small forces in Singapore.     Mr. Holt asked whether the cost of doing this could not be broken down and shared with some ofthe other Commonwealth countries, including Australia.     had any studies been made of the possibility of sharing the burdenin this way with Malaysia and other interested countries.The^JPrime Minister said that a further diffi culty was thatAsian countries, if they felt they could rely on the protectionof a Western power, were reluctant to make any real effort todefend themselves.     Japan was an interesting example of this in her relationship with the U.S.     Mr^^Holt agreed inprinciple.       But he argued that part of any understandingreached with Malaysia and Singapore for a continuing Britishpresence there could be that they themselves should make agre a ter effort.The tiro Prime Ministers then invited their colleagues to join them for the plenary meeting at 11.30 a.m0

BaileyS U B J E CT:DEFENCE POLICY IN THE FAR EAST
TOP SECRET( DEFENCE POLICY IN THE PAR east the PRIME MINISTER after welcoming Mr. Holt and Mr. Fairhallformally, said that in the discussion he had just had with Mr. Holtthey had mentioned defence polic3^ in the Far East and Rhodesia.   Theformer was by far the most important topic for discussion and mightform the subject of the present meeting.   He suggested that when theymet again en the evening of l6th June they should discuss the european economic Community and the Middle East.   He added that Britain didnot intend to suggest that there should be a Commonwealth PrimeMinisters&apos; meeting this year.MR. HOLT thanked the Prime Minister for his welcome. The problemof defence policy in the Far East, he said, was one of criticalsignificance and great concern to the Australian Government, themore so since they had been heartened by the discussions a year ago,from which they understood that Britain intended to maintain a militarypresence in Malaysia and Singapore for as far ahead as could be seen,so long as the host countries welcomed it.   Australian militarythinking had been based on this understanding, and the discussion ofother possible facilities for the deployment of British forces, affectingAustralia itself, had been seen as contingency planning for use only if Malaysia or Singapore changed their attitude towards the british military presence.   It had been a shock to learn that the BritishGovernment had gone in their thinking beyond that point, and were contemplating the possibility of complete withdrawal from the area,even though eight years was a very long time to look ahead.The concern felt in Australia was not primarily for their own security or welfare.   There had been a remarkable development in australian export trade with the area, which had risen from 10 per cent of her total export trade in the 1950s to more than l\0 per cent now.For example, Australian exports to Japan would this year outstrip,for the first time, the value of Australian exports to Britain.   Yet,although there were statistics showing that the Australian proportion of exports to Britain had fallen, their money value was higher than everand this trade was a very considerable factor in the economy of both countries.   Britain had about  1,000 million invested in Australia, and perhaps double that sum in the whole area East of Suez, so that Britishinterests had a very substantial material stake in the area.-1-
Recent events in Hong Kong and the Gulf of Aqaba showed that britain could not divorce herself from the problems af the area east of Suez.   As for the countries cf South East Asia which mr. Holt had visited, their economic growth was very considerable,and it was heartening to see, for example, South Korea and Taiwanbuilding up their economies so rapidly.   The prosperity and developmentof Malaysia were in marked contrast with the days of the fight againstthe terrorists there.   Thailand, where the United States wasbuilding a substantial infrastructure, was making rapid strides.   he drew attention to the potentialities for British trade with thisrapidly developing area:    three-fifths of the world&apos;s populationlived East of Suez, and (unlike Africa) they had thousands of yearsof civilisation behind them, and were much closer than most african countries to the economic take-off point.   It vras not true thatPrince Sihanouk was another Sukarno;   he was far more concerned witheconomic development than Sukarno ever had been.   There was surelya British interest in being well regarded throughout this complex of countries and having a significant presence there, not merely as amilitary power but also as a trading partner.   It was a question ofthe British position in the world, and in the Csmmonwealth as awhole, for withdrawal from the area would be shattering to Britain&apos;relations with Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore,  andthe pull already exerted on these countries by the United States vTOuldbe that much greater.He was also concerned about the readiness of the United States tomaintain the security pattern which had emerged in South East Asiasince the war.   It was not generally recognised how far the UnitedStates was committed to the security of the countries in the area.There was a wide semi-circle of states to which they had givenundertakings of some kind, and the only area for which they had not accepted a substantial security commitment was Malaysia and Singapore.This the United Sta/tes had always regarded as a Commonwealth, andprimarily a British, responsibility.   The United States would feel it very strongly if she were the only external country left with amilitary presence on the mainland.   The view had been put in Britainthat the complete withdrawal of British forces from Malaysia and singapore would be paralleled by United States plans for leavingVietnam after the war had ended there, but in practice the situationswere very different.   If Britain proclaimed her forthcoming complete-2-
withdrawal the effect on Congressional and general opinion in theUnited States would he very damaging, and would weaken the Americancapacity to sustain the stability of Ssuth East Asia.   They consideredthe British presence there very important, just as they weretremendously, perhaps disproportionately, appreciative of the smallAustralian and New Zealand forces in Vietnam.   They were still moregrateful to have Britain standing by them, with her great moralInfluence and standing in the world, helping to maintain the securityof the area.After this general introduction, he wishod to say with relationto Britain&apos;s specific problems in the area that no one presentunderestimated her economic problems, nor did they dispute her need to run down her forces in the Ear East now that confrontation was over.       But they recalled the significance of the campaigns inMalaysia against the terrorists and the Indonesians, which illustrated the importance of the British military presence there.   No doubtfurther threats would arise, but others would be deterred by thepresence of British troops.   Australia had never contemplated that britain would seek to withdraw completely in the absence of pressure from Malaysia and Singapore.   But he did not suggest that britain should wholly reverse her policy,,   He wished, however, to voice the unanimous wish of the four Commonwealth countries of the area - andhe thought, the United States - in putting two suggestions to theBritish Government.Firstly, the Commonwealth countries hoped that we should, in the short term, retain some flexibility in our thinking about the futureof the Commonwealth Brigade.   This was an important manifestationof Commonwealth teamwork and one of the few examples of a jointattempt to preserve Commonwealth strategic interests.   On the logisticside, he hoped that there would be at least a continuing Britishpresence sufficient to make the Brigade viable.   If the British didnot take part in the Commonwealth Brigade, he could not see it being maintained, at least while the Vietnam war continued.   If the UnitedStates Government-accepted General Westmoreland&apos;s plans to build up his forces to 600,000 men, there would be pressure on Australia (and others)-3-
to augment her forces there.   The maintenance of the existingAustralian force in Vietnam, which was based on a twelve montht*ur of duty followed by three years&apos; absence from the theatre,was complicated by the draft system and the need to keep regulartreops fighting alongside conscripts.   Therefore, for the period up to 1970- or 1971 the Australian Government would like to thinkthat Britain would remain flexible in her thinking about the futureof the Commonwealth Brigade.The second point was that he wished most earnestly to impress on the British Government that no final decisions should be taken at this time about what should be done in the mid-1970s, and certainly that no announcement of any such decisions should be madeat present.   He did not preclude any planning which might contemplate the eventual complete withdrawal of British forces from the mainland,and he recognised that perhaps the situation which would exist inthe mid-1970s might justify this.     But If the British government felt that it must take the final decision to withdraw now, whilerefraining from annfiuncing it, it must be accepted that the decisions would eventually become publicly known, perhaps as part of the processof communicating it to other interested governments.   There wouldthen be a chain reaction affecting the United States&apos; attitudetowards Britain and South East Asia, which would be highly unfavourableso far as the Australian view was concerned.   There was no compellingneed for a decision to be taken now, since eight years was quite along time in so turbulent an area as South East Asia.   Planning was quite a different question, and no one oould object to Britain makingcontingency plans.   So long as no final decision were taken, everyonewould be able to adjust themselves to new situations which might arise in the period ahead.   The uncertainties of the Vietnam situation were a compelling factor for leaving the matter open, since no one could say how long the war would last, what the ultimate result -wouldbe, nor what might develop on the way.   He hoped that neither Chinanor Russia would become involved, but there were such questions asthe direction of any expanded activity by North Vietnam, and thepossibility of subversion or infiltration in Malaysia or Thailandif China were checked further North. It was therefore highly desirablethat no final decision should be taken at this time.
THE SECRETARY OE STATE FOR DEFENCE said that while we recognised the importance of our economic interests in the area and the prospectsthat they might grow, the fact was that we were now spending morethere on defence than we earned from these countries, and that it was likely that we should continue to receive these earnings even if wehad no military presence there.   The real reason for our presence was our interest in the peace, prosperity and stability of South East Asia, andour task was to decide what contribution we could make to these endsby military means, and how much defence money we should spend in this area rather than others.Setting out the factors behind British thinking, he said that if ithad been possible to reduce the percentage of CNP spent on defence while maintaining the defence budget at the 196k level, at constant prices,there would have been no need for these changes in our policy in the far east, but unfortunately the economic assumptions about the rate of growth of the British economy had not been borne out in reality.   One reason forthis was excessive Government expenditure overall, and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer would have to impose cuts right across the board.   It wouldbe politically impossible to make very painful cuts on the civil sidewithout also reducing defence expenditure, and he had been set the target of cutting  200 million to  300 million a year by 1970-71.   He had at firsthoped to do so without altering our basic military posture in the Far East,but he had found that it was only possible to plan for this on-the basisof removing our forces permanently from the mainland.   Even so, this couldnot be done by 1970 or 1971, and he must tell his civil colleagues thathe could do so only by 1975, long after the cuts that they would have to suffer.   These savings could be made only if we ceased to keep permanentfacilities on the mainland.   The reasons for this were that fixed baseswere exceedingly expensive in two ways, especially if the local governmentcould not guarantee their security. Firstly, the stockpile of equipment required so large a number of men to protect it and to provide naval and air defence in support of the protecting force that it became quite disproportionboth to the real military oapability which it supported and to the money available for defence,   A multiplier effect was at work, and there were some 300,000 people (including dependants) associated with the British bases in Malaysia end Singapore.   We could not make the required budgetary savingswithout abolishing these base facilities altogether but it would not bedene before the mid-1970s.   The second factor was that since Britain depended upon volunteers for her forces, they must be offered a fair proportion oftheir time at home with their families.   This meant that there must infact be a relief battalion at home for every battalion in the far east, even though it might not be needed   as part of our   reserves.-5- &apos; &apos;    .
Although, to make savings of the order required, the bases must be got rid of entirely by 1975, this would not mean that the British military capability in the area would decline proportionately.   With the aid ofnew types of aircraft, and of assault ships and commando carriers, wecould keep a capability with smaller base facilities or none, so that even after withdrawal we could still have a very substantial capabilityIn the Par East.   Ministers had agreed in the last fortnight to keepsuch a capability, and to discuss its nature and deployment with our allies.This capability would have naval and air elements.   The Gurkhas would remain in the area for some years, but the other land, forces would bebrought out.   If they required equipment to a level sufficient solely for internal security duties, they could be returned quite quickly, butit would take three months before they could engage in a major campaignlike Korea or Vietnam.The British Government hoped to save  300 Qiiiion on the defence budgethy 1975, of which about  200 million would come from the reductions In thethree Services as a result of the closure of the bases in Malaysia and singapore.   It had been suggested that the compensatory aid to thesecountries would eat up the savings, but their total earnings from theBritish military presence in foreign exchange were about  50 million a year,and even if we gave them that sum for 10 years we should still be saving 150 million a-year.   In view of the economic background, there was no alternative to this policy.Returning to the question of the phasing of the rundown, he said thatto achieve the maximum savings by 1970-71 , which was the target date forthe cuts on the civil Departments,  it would be necessary to reduce by then to a mainly maritime and air presence in the Par East, apart fromthe Gurkhas (who would not be finally demobilised until the end of 1972).The first reason for this was that the Governments of Malaysia and singapore thought that sophisticated sea and air forces would be moreuseful to them than ground forces, which they themselves could provide.He had discussed this question with Tunku Abdul Rahman and withMr. Lee Kuan Yew, and both had strongly agreed with this point.   Thelesson of the recent war in the Middle East was that the availability -expensive sophisticated forces was critical.   Malaysia and Singaporecould not provide them, whereas we could.    It was interesting that sir Alec Douglas-Home had made a similar point in the House of commons in April 1966.   The other reason for concentrating on a sea/air force was the effect of early reductions on Singapore.   Everyone was very conscious that the Indonesian threat was dormant, and that the main problem was the
political and economic stability of the countries in the area, andespecially Singapore.. Between 20 and 30 per cent of the gross national product of Singapore was entirely dependent on the British forces, andwe must, therefore, give the maximum help to cushion the shock of ourreductions.   This meant that the first reductions would have to takeplace in Malaysia, a richer country and one less dependent on the prosperity brought by our forces, and thus that the Army units stationedthere must take the brunt of these first reductions.   He agreed that itwas most important to maintain the image of Commonwealth militarycapacity in the area but it was not necessary to maintain the CommonwealthBrigade in that form for the purpose.   The Commonwealth Brigade was merely a part of the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve, which had been set .up years ago as a contribution to SEATO and the Malaysian Defence Treaty,under ANZAM.   The Brigade had never   operated as a force and New zealand had decided to take a company out to send it to fight in Vietnam withouttelling us.   MR. HOLT interjected that Australia would not take anythingout of the Brigade if Britain wanted her to keep it there.THE DEFENCE SECRETARY continued that British forces would bo retained in the area beyond 1975 if it was so decided in consultation with our allies.   By 1970-71 we should have run down to a very powerful amphibiousforce, always including one commando carrier and one assault ship as wellas other craft, supported by large air forces.   The commandos could notconveniently be counted as part of the Commonwealth Brigade, but there wasno reason why there should not be a rotation so that Australian andNew Zealand troops should sometimes sail in their place;    similarly,the commandos could exercise on land with   other Commonwealth forces.A maritime and air force was more visible than ground forces.   It couldvisit Djakarta or Thailand;   it could take an Australian company orbattalion to show the flag in these places, whereas soldiers in Malaysiacould only be seen in that country.   He added that although the UnitedStates Government liked to say that the British presence in South East Asiawas of critical importance, it was curious that Mr. Macnamara had never-mentioned it when introducing his defence budget in Congress this year,even in the context of confrontation.   Finally, THE DEFENCE SECRETARYcontinued, although it had been agreed to consider providing a capabilityfor action in the area after 1975j and deploying some of it there, no decisions on detail had yet been taken.   The force might be based, forexample, on Britain (though this would provide a smaller and less efficientpresence in the Far East) or, if the Australian Government agreed, onCockburn Sound.    If there were a smooth rundown in Singapore, if the regime-7-
consolidated its position, and if internal security was maintained, hecould see no reason why the ships should not refit and maintain in thedockyoard there, which by that time would be under civil management.He was sure that Mr. Lee was able to control the situation if anyonecould.   It was possible that the naval base might be handed over to civilian management, and he could say that one of britain&apos;s best firmswas very impressed by its possibilities.   There was also no reason whymilitary aircraft should not be passed through Singapore.   But detaileddecisions were not yet necessary, so long as it was decided in principlethat Britain should deploy her forces in the area.As for the need to take, or to announce, at this time the decisionto leave the mainland, there must for planning purposes be an assumptionthat we should have done so by 1975, since the necessary savings could-not otherwise be achieved.   And a planning assumption, like a decision, was likely to become known.   But there was a big difference between anannounced decision and one which had not been announced, to which theGovernment were not publicly committed.   British Ministers had made itclear in Defence white Papers and in debate that they were committed to producing a situation in which the local peoples could live at peace without the presence of external forces, but they had been very careful not to say when this would be.   This could, of course, mean leaving thePersian Gulf as well as Singapore and Malaysia.   It would be possibleto take the line that we could see clearly only up to 1970-71, and that weshould have to look at the current situation then and take our decisionfor the future of the bases.   No doubt there would&apos;be rumours, but thiswould be different from a known decision which obliged other governments to base their plans upon it.   On the other hand there were two pointsagainst this approach.   One was that if we gave the impression that wewere leaving but were vague about the date, some people might think thatit could be earlier than 1975 - for example 1971 .   The other was thatthe Government would gain great political kudos if it announced a decision in principle to leave the bases by 1975.   This was not merely a matterof party opinion, but of public opinion as a whole, and some people saidthat it would be necessary to fix a date in order to get the requiredpublic support.   MR. HOLT said that he doubted whether anyone would think the date would be earlier than 1975, in view of all that had been said,but that it was important to make people think it might be later.-8-
THE PRIME MINISTER observed that no decision had yet been taken aboutthe matters that had been discussed, but the discussion had shown how the minds of British Ministers were moving.   There would be talks with theTunku and with Mr. Leo, and their views would be taken into account before a decision was taken,MR. HOLT said that he had tried to explain Australian thinking, and was grateful for the clean presentation by the Defence Secretary.   All the implications however were not yet clear.   It would be unwise to discountthe United States&apos; attitude to a British withdrawal, since they had spokenvery vehemently on the subject to the Australians.   The extent of theircommitments made them firm in their resolution not to fill any vacuumthat Britain might leave, though only the future could show xvhether theywould adhere to this attitude.   It would be for British Ministers to judge whether their plans would sustain In the minds of the people ofSouth East Asia a view of Britain consonant with her historic role.   Itwould be sad if in concentrating on Europe Britain were to forget theworld outside.   Her place in the Commonwealth and in the world at largewas affected by the degree to which she found it possible to provide amilitary presence where it was needed.MR. EAIRH/iLL said that in the face of the British economic situation it was hard to dispute the financial arguments, but pointed out that theBritish now seemed to be planning to go home before the desired regionalsituation could have been established in South East Asia.   The UnitedStates had made in plain that they would not fill the vacuun that britain would leave and Australia could not do so since her own defence budgethad grown by a third last year and was likely to go up by another 12 to15 per cent this year, and since she had virtually doubled over the last five years the proportion of her gross national product which she spenton defence.   The question mark over the future of Indonesia meant thata credible deterrent must be retained, and he would like to discuss more closely the future of the Commonwealth Brigade and the timetable   for amilitary response after the bases had been closed.MR. HOLT said that the relaxed attitude of the Tunku&apos;and Mr. Loe was largely an expression of their desire not to produce a feeling of lack ofconfidence in the future of the area which might affect outside powers.Their very strong concern, which they had expressed to the Australians,should not be underestimated.   THE DEFENCE SECRETARY replied that when hehad visited them both were mainly concerned about the announcement of thelong-term decision, but he had been much impressed with the fact that-9-
Mr. Lee was better pleased with a sea/air presence.   Both had said thatthey saw no threat from Thailand or China.   Malaysia was not worried aboutSingapore (apart from the political influence of Mr. Lee on the Chinese).Although they were worried about the Indonesians they had assuredMr. Stewart and himself after confrontation that they would, themselveshandle the defence of East Malaysia.   Britain had little interest in thefuture of Sabah and Sarawak, and while we were worried about the long-termintentions of the Indonesians, it was in the air and at sea that anyexpansionist tendencies would have to be checked.   It was not easy   tosee a military threat, unless Malaysia and Singapore fought each other.It had taken Australia a long time to contribute forces to the threat of confrontation, and there might be a different view beteeen us if therewere a recurrence of that threat.   The essential problem was economic,affecting the stability of Malaysia and Singapore.   They could providea dangerous focus of infection if the operation were wrongly carried out.But we were well aware of the danger of a key area which was totallydependent on foreign troops for its security.   Eight years was a longtime, and v/e were very fortunate that Mr. Lee was Prime Minister cfSingapore.   We looked forward to his visit to Britain next week.THE PRIME MINISTER, in conclusion, underlined two points.   First ofall, whatever the Malaysians might feel, the right division would be for britain to provide the sophisticated sea and air forces which they couldnot provide, while they (the Malaysians) ought to develop their ground forces.   There would also be advantages from developing the civil airportand dockyard.   Secondly, a capability of this kind was much more effective as a visible deterrent than land forces.MR. HOLT said that he would contest the Defence Secretary&apos;s accountof the risks to the countries in the area, and would do this in discussionwith Mr. Healey on the next day.The Meeting concluded at 12.50 p.m.Cabinet Office,14th June 1967-10-
EXTRACTRECORD OP A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE PR IB/IE MINISTER AND THEPRIME MINISTER OP AUSTRALIA AT 10 DOWNING STREET at.30 P.Mo ON THURSDAY, JUNE 15* 1967Present:The Prime Minister The Rt. Hon. Harold HoltMr. A.M. Palliser Sir John BuntingBritishAFar^Eastern^Defence PolicyMro-: Holt said that he had had an excellent talk theprevious day with the Defence Secretary.     He felt a good dealhappier than when he came to Britain.     But he thought it might be helpful for the Prime Minister to rave a fairly fullwritten statement of the Australian position.     He would accordingly he sending this to Mr. Wilson before he left,,Meanwhile, he had the draft with him and thought the PrimeMinister might care to glance at it.     The Prime Minister readthrough the draft and said that he thought it would indeed be helpful for his colleagues and himself to have thisexposition of the Australian Government&apos;s viewpoint.Mr. Holt said that he had also prepared a comprehensivelist of statements by British Ministers and in British white papers over the past two years.     He wished to assure thePrime Minister that this had not been done in any carping orcritical spirit;   but because he wished us to realise that these statements had been taken very seriously in Australia and it was important that there should be no misunderstanding about theextent to which Australians believed that Britain was committed to a certain position in the area.     He gave a copy of hislist to the Prime Minister.     The Prime Minister said that henoted the reference to his own speech of exactly one yearpreviously.     He believed that what he had said stood the test of time very well.     It still represented the policy ofHoMoGo /Mr. Holtsecret
Mr. Holt then referred to the circumstantial accounts incertain morning newspapers of his talks the previous day with british Ministers.   He wished to assure the Prime Minister thatthese reports were not the result of a &quot;leak&quot; from theAustralian team in London or from himself personally.     Hedeplored them as much as he was sure the Prime Minister would.They could only do haim to the common purposes of the twoGovernments.     He had so far not spoken to any journalists;and &quot;before leaving London he would only speak to a fewAustralian correspondents to whom he would put the broadconsiderations involved.       He would say that he recognisedthat no firm British decisions had been conveyed to him at this stage;    that the atmosphere for their talks had beenexcellent;    and that he knew the views he and his colleagues had expressed would receive the fullest, consideration inLondon.     The Prime Minister added that he could say that,after this consideration, the two Governments would again bein touch on the matter.     Mr. Holt said that in general he would do his best to play down the significance of the exchangeso    the present&apos;i me, Mini s t er said that this would be a perfectly fair line to take with the Press.     He referred to his own reply that afternoon to a Question by Sir Alec Douglas Home and hisrefusal to make any Statement until the completion of his talks with the Prime Minister of Malaysia and Singapore.     Mr. Holtsaid that he hoped the British Government would keep incontinuous totich with the Australian Government and that therewould be further consultation as the process of discussion and study within the British Government developed over thecoming weeks.
PRIME MINISTER1S PERSONAL PRIME MINISTER-&apos;TELEGRAM SERIAL NO. T176/67 CANBERRA.You said to me before I left Australia 011 this presentjourney that your Government would not proceed to decisions on defence matters as they relate to the region of Malaysia and singapore until such time as I had had an opportunity to put to you personally the views of the Australian Government .     Ihave now had this week with you and also with. Mr. Healey andMr. Bowden a series of valuable discussions and you will nodoubt be proceeding in due course to further governmentalconsideration of your position, though I realise that priorto that you have it in mind to meet some of our other interestedcolleagues from other Commonwealth countries,,It seems to me that it would be useful if I were toleave with you this note in which I recapitulate briefly theviews and considerations that I expressed to you with theagreement of my Cabinet colleagues.As you know, I concluded our meeting on Tuesday byasking if you could see your way to meeting two requests thatI was sure would be unanimously supported &quot;by Australia and itsCommonwealth neighbours and by the United States.     The first was that, in the period up to 1970-71 , the British Governmentshould retain some flexibility on the question of theCommonwealth Brigade in Malaysia.     The Brigade, whatever itsdeficiencies, has been an example of effective Commonwealthteamwork and we would wish your Government to leave enoughforces to give it continued viability even if there had tobe some reductions on the logistics side.      Secondly, i expressed the earnest hope that no final British decisions about the period after 1 970-7&quot;!  should be announced or even so much as taken at this time.      I fully accepted that this need not preclude contingency planning covering various possibilities including that of withdrawal of land based forcesbut we saw no need to ratify any planning assumptions at thisstage and felt it important that these should stand unratified.We felt it had to be assumed that if a decision looking towardswithdrawal from the mainland were taken, it would becomewidely known and there could be a highly damaging chainreaction which would not only bring forward the local effects of withdrawal but might also precipitate an earlier withdrawalthan intended.      I mention these tireo requests at this stageso that the remainder of my letter may be read in conjunctionwith them.Before I move on to the general  statement of the considerations which led up to my requests let me say how much Iwelcomed, on behalf of myself and my Government, your indicationto me that you have decided to maintain a capability for usein the Par East after 1975.     This decision recognises, as Ibelieve to be the case, that Britain&apos;s continuing support inthe region is needed to help ensure the consolidation of thesecurity and stability which have resulted in the Malaysianregion from the distinguished role which Britain has historicallyplayed./However f
However, what is important over and above this decision is the location and form in which it is given effect, and it isin this context that I again stress our view concerning thepreservation of land forces &quot;within the region and of theCommonwealth Brigade.     We would wish to see the Brigade retainedas close as possible to its present form and existing stateof readiness at least until 1970-71 , or at any rate to haveforces retained with sufficient military effectiveness so thatthe Brigade presents a credible deterrent and also is able toact promptly for counter insurgency purposes.I now move on to an account in a brief form of theviews and considerations which I put to you in discussion.We do of course appreciate the seriousness of theeconomic difficulties which, have compelled you and your colleagues to contemplate a substantial reduction in thestrength and composition of British forces stationed east of Suez.     We recognise also that some running down of yourlarge establishment in Malaysia and Singapore was to beexpected with the ending of Indonesia&apos;s confrontationcampaign.     But we nevertheless expected that there would bea continuing British military presence within the region, apresence which would include a significant land force,subject to the continuing agreement of the Governments of malaysia and Singapore.     As you know, we have been in receiptof assurances from your Government that you would retain yourimportant military facilities in Malaysia and Singapore for as long as the Governments of these two countries agreed thatyou should do so on acceptable conditions.     Thus we had workedon and supported the assumption that British policies would continue to be as reflected in the Directive issued to theCommander-in-Chief Far East in April of this year.     The mainrelevant points in this Directive are that it is theresponsibility of the Commander-in-Chief to prevent communistand particularly Chinese communist expansion throughout theSEATO area and to fulfil Britain&apos;s obligations under the defence agreement with Malaysia.      In our view these obligations wouldrequire the retention of the Commonwealth Brigade at asatisfactory state of readiness.It consequently caused us deep concern to learn thatthe British Government was not only contemplating making a very early decision to reduce its forces in the region by successivestages but to withdraw them all from the mainland by about 1975?and further to make the decision public now.The basic reason for our concern is the continuinginstability of the entire South-East Asian area and itsvulnerability to pressure and subversion, both internal and external.     We naturally hope that the countries in the area will in due course be able to establish a capability to protectthemselves individually, and in combination with one another,against these pressures.     It is one of the primary aims of australian policy to help them to do so.     But the achievement of this goal is still a long way off.     Until then there is,in our view, a crucial need to maintain the existing framework of treaties and alliances, and to preserve the credibility ofSEATO.     As you knows the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve formsa vital component of the forces nominated for the various SEATOplans.     We would therefore wish to see no closing of optionsat this time./Further,
Further;, we invite Britain to consider the consequences for her world position of a complete military withdrawal fromAsia.     It is our firm conviction that Britain&apos;s long experience and knowledge of the South-East Asian area, and particularly of malaysia and Singapore, carries with it a degree of influencefor international good that perhaps the British people themselvestend to underestimate,,     We &quot;believe that the presence of evena relatively modest British military establishment is in itself a psychological influence for stability and a deterrent against external threat, and a positive factor for Britain^ own standing and welfare.      It is my belief also that Britain&apos;s substantialeconomic interests in the region are likely to develop as thecountries of the region become increasingly prosperous,, whichthey can only do if they are allowed to develop in peace.The Americans have a wide network of defence commitmentsaround the arc of Asia, beginning as far north as Korea,   Butthey have always made it clear that they look upon Malaysia endSingapore as a Commonwealth defence responsibility.     The british military presence in those two countries, and its defence agreement witn Malaysia are each integral and complementary tothe pattern of bilateral treaty arrangements which &quot;&amp;he UnitedStates has developed with other countries.     These arrangements would suffer a loss of support in the United States itself ifBritain were to wind down too far in Singapore and Malaysia.,Further, we would all hope that there might be a settlement in vietnam before 1975;   but in the meantime, the United States&apos;position there could be seriously embarrassed by a Britishdeclaration of intent to withdraw.     The Administration in washington would be likely to encounter mounting resistance in Congress and growing criticism from public opinion.Again, and this is a vital aspect, withdrawal of Britishland forces from this part of Asia would give rise to difficulties for both New Zealand and ourselves in the maintenance of ourpresent forward defence posture.     The;re would also be consequencefor ovr external position, and particularly for our relationswith Asia,     While it may be expected that our own capacity tomake a contribution in the region will increase as our population and national strength grow, we could certainly not look todischarge Britain&apos;s historic role alone.     This would &quot;be trueeven if, as we all very much hope, it is possible to bring about an early settlement in Vietnam,It has been suggested that nowadays the presence of foreign,and particularly white, military forces in Asian countries isscarcely tolerated.     My colleagues and I do not accept this.So far as Malaysia and Singapore are conceited we know that neither country is happy at the prospect of a complete withdrawal of all British land forces after &apos;i975.The submission I have made, of course,  carries the risk ofinvolvement to an extent that you have made clear you no longerwish to bear.     However, any commitment involves risk.     In theAustralian view, the best guarantee that the risks, both fromexternal attack in insurgency, will be contained is the continuing presence in the Malaysian region of a credibleBritish presence, which must, in our view, include a significantland force.     What we are faced with is not so much the likelihood of conventional attack, which sea and air forces could probably easily enough repel, as the likelihood of subversionand. infiltration and growing guerilla activity in an unstable/political
political situation,.     The underpinning of political development in the hands of responsible, moderate leadershipcan only be secured at this stage by the familiar, acceptedpresence of British ground troops.     This, we believe, is stillessential to the maintenance of political confidence.(Sgd9)     Ho HoltThe Kt. Hon. Harold Wilson, O.B.E., M.P.,Prime Minister,10 Downing Street,London, S .W.1 *
CMV(67) 1st MeetingVISIT DP SINGAPORE PRIME MINISTER TO LONDON, JUNE 1967United Kingdom Record of a Meeting heldat 10 Downing Street, S.W.I., onMONDAY, 26th JUNE 1967 at 12.00 noon present:United KingdomThe Rt. Hon. Harold Wilson, MP,Prime MinisterSingaporeMr. Lee Kuan Yew,Prime minister the Rt. Hon. Herbert Bowden, MP,Secretary of State for commonwealth AffairsDr. Goh Keng Swee,Minister of defence the Rt. Hon. Denis Healey, MP,Secretary of State for DefencePield Marshal Sir Richard Hull,Chief of the Defence StaffSir Neil Pritchard,Commonwealth office mr. J.0. Moreton,Commonwealth office mr. P.

HarrisonMr. 0,RS BlairS U B J E C TDEFENCE POLICY IN THE FAR EAST
DEFENCE POLICY IN THE EAR east the PRIME MINISTER suggested that Mr. Lee Kuan Yew should open thediscussion of British defence policy in the Far East, speaking as if thePrime Minister had &quot;been present at the discussions with the commonwealth secretary and Secretary of State for Defence on 22nd and 23rd June.MR. LEE KUAN YE!/ said that if in fact Britain adopted the course which Mr. Healey had outlined at those meetings - that is, that british forces should stay in Malaysia and Singapore until 1970-71 at half thepresent force levels, then run down to 1976, by when they would hope to be offthe mainland, but would have a task force in the area and might even stationone of its two battalions on land in Singapore - then he thought thatSingapore would be all right.   His first worry was that there must be notimetable for the British withdrawals from the mainland; he had expressedthis view in his letter of 26th May to the Prime Minister.   Once peoplebelieved that Britain was committed to leaving the mainland, anxieties, fears,passions and ambitions would arise, and the eight years from now until theproposed withdrawal would telescope.     But if the Governments statement inJuly could be on the lines of the suggestions made by Mr. Healey, Singaporewould be satisfied, from the point of view of defence, and could live withthe situation, so long as - and this was his other worry - this policy wasnot further amended as a result of some other economic crisis, say nextyear.     He would speak frankly, since the lives of millions in singapore and Malaysia would be in jeopardy if the Singapore Government made the wrong decisions.     When, in 1965, Singapore had been asked to leave theMalaysian Federation, they had had to decide, within a period of weeks,how best to ensure military and political security for themselves.     He hadbanked on Britain being able to give Singapore protection for a few years;how many years depended on such factors as the role that Britain wanted,the state of her economy, and her approach to the Common Market.     By thiswholehearted and complete identification with Britain he had been able to generate confidence and a good climate for investment in Singapore.    It wasa calculated move, and he did not seek to appeal to sentiment.     But he hadnoticed with concern the procession of Defence White Papers in recent years,and it was a real anxiety to him that in circumstances beyond the controlof the British Government It might be felt necessary once more to alterBritish defence commitments and assumptions In South East Asia.     If this were done there would be a complete loss of confidence among the peopleof the area and those who controlled its assets, and no further decision-1-
after those to be announced in July could restore that confidence.     In this context he expressed his amazement at the viciousness of the attacks onthe British Government and Prime Minister which were made every day by thewhole British press and by other persons of influence or authority.   Whenhe had been asked \)j a BBC interviewer the loaded question whether hethought Britain had betrayed Singapore, he had replied that he thoughtit was the last thing that Britain wanted to do.     But his real problem was that British domestic party politics might compel a further adjust-ment in Britain!s position, this time with grievous results.Therefore, if what Mr. Healey had said he would say in July had tobe watered down, Singapore would have to make her own planning assumptions.But once she had adjusted her posture, it would make British withdrawal from the mainland speedier than it need be;   for once Singapore gave any idea that she welcomed any association with countries other than Britainand Australia it would start off a train of adverse events.     The Tunku&apos;sbaseless suspicions that he (Mr. Lee) was in contact with Chou En-laiwould be fostered and once the Tunku really began thinking on those lines,the situation would then become unpredictable and unstable.     Thus, eithersome stable arrangement must be devised which could endure to 1976, orwe should be led into quicksands;   either the United States would step in,underwriting the Tunku as they had underwritten Thailand (and Singaporewould have to fit in with this), or all would be lost.It followed from this that there must be certainty in Britain&apos;intentions and obligations towards Singapore, and vice, versat     At theright time there should be a formal defence treaty between the twocountries, not because he thought the British would wish to evade their undertakings, but to create an air of relative permanence.   The Treaty wouldhave to be publicly announced, though not all the obligations and detailscontained in it need be.     The essential was that Singapore1s ground forces should join with Britain&apos;s sophisticated air cover and naval protection to provide stability.     If they did so, Singapore vrould stillbe a thriving community in a hundred year &apos;s time. It was, at present,the only place in South Asia which adhered approximately to Westernstandards of administration, housing, health and social amenities.All this would go once the fear arose that the position was slipping.This might happen not at the wish of the British Prime Minister, but because pressures on sterling, the demands of the European economic community, the views of the trades unions and the spectre of devaluation-2-
night generate rumours which would flow hack to Singapore.     Once Britishbusinesses began to liquidate their investments in Singapore and Malaysiathe local businessmen would follow suit,   and Singapore would go down.He had explained feis to Mr. Healey on 23rd April in Singapore.     Hewould not pretend that Singapore had not done her own contingency thinking;they read the British press and reports as assiduously as anybody in Asia,since their lives depended on a correct understanding of their situation.But they were still acting on their earlier decision that their futurelay for a long while to come in association with Britain.He therefore suggested that, if it were politically convenient andfeasible, there should be instituted along with the proposed defencetreaty an arrangement which would be of great benefit to Singapore,Malaysia and perhaps to Britain.     This would be a kind of &quot;CommonwealthReserve&quot;, for the defence of Malaysia and Singapore and the maintenanceof peace in their area.     It would be multi-national, with contingentsfrom Malaysia, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand as well as Britain.It did not matter if it did not make great sense in military terms, sinoethe political and economic advantages were enormous.     Prom his point ofview it would remove Malaysian fears of Singapore and the danger of pre-emptive action.     The Malaysian Government had an impression of singapore as too clever and too dangerous by half, and foreign correspondentsreturning from Kuala Lumpur often reported that the Malaysians thoughtthat Singapore was up to no good.     Fantastic stories might be set aboutin order to justify pre-emption by Malaysia, sinoe they realised that every day their capacity to snuff out Singapore was diminishing.Malaysia   must understand that unless relations in the area were stable,in ten years they would need to fear Singapore.     Malaysia was a dividednation, with areas where the Malays were outnumbered;   for example, theChinese predominated in Johore.     Lord Head had remarked to him on theprevious day that once there a was an air of instability about Singapore,then Malaysia and Indonesia would get together to destroy her.     This wasa dangerous and unstable situation.     The present men in power in   Kuala.Lumpur, whatever their defects, were not adventurers and wanted peace intheir lifetime.     Therefore he wished to assist them to stay in power as long as possible.     The Tunku knew that if he took over Singapore once more, by pre-emptive action, he would be subject not only to all the dangers which had caused him to eject her from Malaysia, but also to arunning international sore, since Singapore would retain her seat in theUnited Nations and would carry on propaganda against Malaysia indefinitely.-3-
Since the Tunku, like himself, wanted security, it would he test if theforces of both countries could bat on the same side under Britishcaptaincy.     There would then be less danger of their being exploitedby the Indonesians, people who spent all their lives conspiringoften to no purpose but very successfully when they dealt with KualaLumpur.     It was no doubt they who fed the Tunku stories of Mr. Lee&apos;s agreement with Ghou En-lai  to start a1 Chinese communist empire in SouthEast Asia, and who fed the stispicions, vanities and jealousies of thoMalaysians.     It would, of course, kill any idea of a Commonwealth forceif it became known that he (Mr. Lee) had suggested it.     Once there were a climate of relative ease, the climate for investment would improveenormously, and both Malaysia and Singapore would benefit.     He did not know what advantages it would bring to Britain, to provide a sort of nato Commander, for such a disparate outfit, but if he were theCommonwealth secretary public relations officer he would make muchof the fact that in one part of the world the British were still lovedand wanted.Only two powers presented dangers to Singapore.     In the short term,Malaysia could endanger her, but this possibility would become seriousonly if the   Tunku were dead and Razak pushed out by some group of wi2dmen, along with the present army commanders;   and if this did not happen forthe next few years, Singapore would be safe.     The real longer term dangert.ame from Indonesia.     The military government there was making no progress and the country was going down.     The United States had set up aid projects and purchasing agencies, and was pumping in large quantities of consumer goods to bolster the regime.     But it was as corrupt as ever, and the students had already started to demonstrate against this corruption.     TheUnited States and Australia were convinced that they must back a right-wingmilitary government there, because if Sukarno returned the IndonesianCommunist Party would come into Its own.    When China had recovered from thedifficulties of the Red Guard period, she might start a running civil warthroughout Indonesia.     Then Malaysia and Singapore,if undefended, would present the Indonesian Government with an attractive internationaldiversion, as West Irian had done.     A clear impression must be given thatthis was no longer feasible.     The last confrontation campaign had been mainly fought by British and Gurkha troops.     This time Malaysia and singapore would play a full part, and a credible British presence would beall that was required to maintain stability.
MR. LEE said that his remarks would find no support in Canberra orWellington, where there were different views on what the countries in thearea should do.     There would he disapproval, or even anger, at his suggestion.     But if he were an Englishman he would say to himself thatthe policy that he had advocated was sound, hearing in mind that it wasnine years to 1976.     He had been in office for nearly nine, years, and theAsia of 1959 was very different from that of today.     It had looked thenas if the Communists would take over all Southern Asia, and in 19&amp;1 someof his colleagues had acted on that assumption and changed sides.     But heand his present oolleagues had gone on, and the world had changed.     TheRed Guards 1 activities had caused China to lose face among the wholeChinese population of South East Asia;   the position of the Singapore government relative to other countries in Asia had vastly improved.     Whenother United Kingdom troops were off the mainland in nine years time hecould not ask to have more than one battalion onshore in Singapore andone afloat.He Y/as only worried whether this would in fact be the timetable.Mr. Healey had said that if no date were fixed it might mean that theBritish might be off the mainland in 1972;   to this he would say that hewould take his chances, since five years was also a long time.     He thereforeurged that if it was politically possible the British Government should doits best to see that its July statement put the issue of British defence policy in the Far East to rest for a long time.     It must not recur every two years with a change in policy at each economic crisis (not that leaving the mainland would help britain&apos;s economic situation - it might make itworse).     For Singapore the touchstone was to create an air of finality orrelative finality.    Australian Ministers had been severely shaken by beingtold that white faces were not welcomed on the mainland of Asia.     the australians were not accustomed to living in the shadow of great and immediate danger.     But Singapore was, and they had shed the habit ofcrying out at the prospect of danger, unlike the Malaysians.If Britain adopted his suggestions, there was a negligible prospectof hor being called upon to pay heavily for it.     Indonesia would remainquiet, and Malaysia happy so far as external defence was concerned.Malaysia was in for internal security problems, and there might well betrouble in Sarawak, but the last British Defence White Paper had made itclear that Britain would not again embark alone on a campaign like thatagainst confrontation.      If Sabah and Sarawak were lost, it would be dearto the world that the Malaysians had lost them through driving the local
people to revolt by their desire to create an empire from them.     Thiswould not worry him.     It would be very different if Singapore had bigneighbours who thought that she would be ready for the picking in five toton years, and if those whose money was invested in Singapore alsobelieved that the country must die.    He therefore urged - and there werearguments of sentiment and moral obligation to which he could appeal - that britain should create on air of relative finality about her defence policyin the area.     If she did not, Singapore would be in very great peril, hutBritain would also have more sterling problems than now.    While theMiddle Eastern countries held  450 million in sterling in Britain,Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and Hong Kong had  750 million.     If Britishmerchants were to decide to sell their rubber estates and tin mines thehundred rich families in Singapore, who owned half the non-Britishholdings of rubber and tin in Malaysia yet lived in Singapore for greatersafety, would also sell up,    A rumour that a loading British bank had started to sell could load to a crash, and this might load to another run onthe pound and, perhaps a further Defence Review.    No one could gain from such a policy.      It would bo possible for the British to make carefulsecret preparations to soil out and leave Singapore at short notice, but he did not believe that Britain wanted this.     He was however very disturbed by the climate of opinion among Labour Party backbenchers, and he hoped thoywould realise that setting a date for withdrawal, as in Aden, was not theway out of Britain&apos;s difficulties.     He feared that the climate almost ofdespair at Britain&apos;s intractable economic problems might percolate fromthe Labour backbenches through Britain.     THE PRIME MINISTER commented thatthere had been a groat change of opinion recently.      Mr. Loe&apos;s forthcomingmooting with the Parliamentary Labour Party could be very important,THE SECRETARY 0E STATE EOR DEFENCE said he would begin his remarksby correcting a misunderstanding.     Mr. Lee had spoken as if Britain firmlyintended to maintain a commando battalion on land in Singapore after the bases had gone in 1975.     But this plan was for the period 1970 to 1975.He would recapitulate the stage the Government had reached over plans forafter 1975.     The Cabinet had merely agreed that Ministers should boprepared to offer a continuing capability for action in the Far East afterBritish forces had left the mainland in 1975-76.     This was the onlyCabinet decision, and they had not decided what capability, if any, shouldbe kept in the area.   The figures ho had mentioned in previous meetingswere devised in the Ministry of Defence for planning purposes, and were based on costings assuming a naval presence in Australia;   but so far theCabinet had not agreed what capability there should be in the area, if any,
nor where it should be based.     There were three theoretical possibilities:the ships could be based on Britain, or on Western Australia, or could useSingapore for rest and refit in the naval dockyard which would by then be under civil management.     In the afternoon Ministers would hear the first report on the consultations with Commonwealth countries.     Mr. Lee must notmistake the position by talcing as Cabinet policy his (the Defence Secretary&apos;s)personal views and the figures worked out by his Ministry.As for what should be said in public, the Cabinet had not decided whether to say that British forces would be off the mainland by 1976 or tobe vague on the matter.      He would propose that they should say thatBritish forces in the Far East would be reduced to half Defence Reviewforce levels by 1970-71, leaving a residual presence of air and naval units, with a small number of Gurkhas;   that while reaffirming that the aim was to wind up the bases on the mainland of Asia, they could notforetell when this might come about;   and that even then they intended to keep a capability for use in the Far East.   There were also two points on which hewould not at present wish to press for a decision.     One was whether toindicate in public the nature of the amphibious force Britain proposed tokeep in the Far East after leaving the mainland;   and the other was whether to indicate publicly at this stage that if Singapore and Britain, inco-operation, could ensure that the rundown caused no economic upheavalin Singapore and did not upset the stability of the country, it was intended that British forces should be rotated through Singapore after the bases there had been liquidated, using the present naval dockyard operated on a civilian basis by the Singapore Government. -*If he got that far he would have done extremely well, given thepresent climate of opinion.    At a later date consideration could be givento the suggestion discussed on 23rd June for a framework of Commonwealthoo-operation which would associate   Singapore and Malaysia in a new defencerelationship with Britain, Australia and New Zealand.     The same appliedto the question of tailoring the Singapore and Malaysian defence forces soas to provide the components absent from the proposed British naval-aircapacity.     It would also be necessary to defer consideration of the natureof the new defence commitment which Britain might assume as regardsSingapore.     At present the commitment was unilateral, since while Singaporeacknowledged that she regarded Britain&apos;s defence agreement with Malaysiaas binding upon her, Britain was under no juridical obligation towardsSingapore.     It had been left to Singapore to initiate formal discussionsfor an agreement to supersede the Malaysian Defence Agreement whose applica.-tion in respect of Singapore came to an end when the country separated from Malaysia.
THE DEFENCE SECRETARY added that he had not heard Mr. Lee&apos;s ideasbefore 23rd June.   He saw nuch that was attractive in then, since ho hadoften thought that Britain had a legitimate role in Singapore and Malaysiawhich she did not have in the countries further north.     In his view itwas not Britain&apos;s task to co-operate in the containment of China, but toprovide an area, of peace and stability in the region of Malaysia and singapore.     But Australia, New Zealand and the United States saw britain srole differently, and would disagree with him.     The policy proposed byMr. Lee would raise problems for these countries, and it would be wise to pursue It slowly, keeping options open as far as possible.     If the issueof British defence policy in the Far East was to be put to rest, It wouldalso be necessary to lot sleeping dogs lie.     It was   his personal judgmentthat the objective which he had just sketched were as far as the BritishGovernment, with effort and goodwill, was likely to get this year.     Itmust be accepted that the price of leaving vague the date at which theBritish might withdraw from the mainland was leaving vague the question ofwhat might happen when they had done so.THE PRIME MINISTER asked Mr. Lee for his views on the proposal thatSingapore should take over the naval dockyard for civil use.     MR. LEEreplied that it was an excellent proposal.     Swan Hunter had taken overthe management of the Singapore Government dookyard, which had been badlyrun, and the Government was considering taking a share in the equity.Throe years ago they had built a new dockyard in conjunction with twoJapanese firms, who had lost money on it for tho first two years.   Now theywere doing well enough to start constructing a 190,000 ton dry dock for thobig tankers which passed by Singapore.     The peculiarities of the tankertrade meant that they would save money by docking in Singapore rather thanimmediately after discharging in Japan.     He had discussed dockyards withMr. Reynolds at the Ministry of Defence.     The British service chiefs in singapore were naturally unhappy at the idea of moving out, likearistocrats reluctant to hand over their stately homes.     But the phasingin the White Paper meant that the dockyard would become redundant by 1974,and he therefore suggested that a committee should now be formed, withrepresentation from the Navy Department and Swan Hunter, so that it couldimmediately begin to plan for converting the dockyard to civilian use.This planning would take eighteen months, by which time part of the basemight be available for conversion.-8-
MR. LEE continued that a problem was what to do with throe serviceairfields.     He would like to know whether it was worth leaving one foruse by the British P. 111s.     For the rest, he would like the BritishGovernment to agree that his Economic Development Board should begin to start looking at the workshops and facilities there to see what they couldbe turned into.     It would be helpful if clear directions to co-operate in this could be given to the service authorities concerned.     It wascrucial that the machinery should be left behind, and not destroyed, asnaval regulations had obliged the Navy to destroy machine tools which wouldhave been most welcome in trade schools in Singapore.There was one more matter which was crucial in order to set at resttho minds of the Singapore Government.     This was the obligation that theBritish Government owed to it.     It was not a very serious problem,unless the Tunku died and Razak was pushed out, in which case Mr. Leowould at once come back to London for an answer.     Britain should acknowledgean obligation to defend Singapore against all forms of external attack,including all forms of attack by her neighbours.     He did not mind if this undertaking was given secretly, by an exchange of letters, but it was important that Singapore should know whore she stood.     THE C0MM03WEALTHSECRETARY said ho would like to have a look at this problem.     It was similar to the problem of Brunei.      MR. LEE said that Brunei was a very different proposition, since it was a British protectorate.The Meeting adjourned at 1.15 p.n. for lunch.Cabinet Office, S.W.1 .28th June 1967
