C(67) HO COPY NO. J^L26th June, 1967CABINETLOCAL, GOVERNMENT IN WALES: DRAFT WHITE paper note by the Secretary of State for wales ask for my colleagues approval to the publication of this white paper.2.     The Cabinet decided on 27th January, 1966 (CC(66) 4th Conclusions,Minute 4) that the work on the reorganisation of local government in wales which my predecessor had already put in hand should be continuedas a separate exercise from that for England and Scotland.3.       On 5th May, 1967, the Home Affairs Committee approvedChapters I to IV of the attached draft White Paper.    These chapters setout the Governments proposals for reducing the existing countryboroughs from four to three (Merthyr being demoted), the counties from13 to 5 and the non-county boroughs, urban districts and rural districtsfrom 164 to 36.    They also indicate the consequential adjustments needed in functions and make certain proposals to avoid passible difficultiesin relation to finance and staff.    To avoid embarrassment in relationto the Royal Commissions, the White Paper does not discuss theprinciples of local authority organisation and presents its proposals as a means of meeting the urgent and special need of Wales for reducingthe number and increasing the strength of its local authorities.Paragraph 15 states that, if experience of the working of the new system in Wales and of the changes decided on for England and Scotland afterthe Royal Commissions have reported show that further adjustment ofthe Welsh local government system is needed, such adjustment will bemade at an appropriate time.4.       Chapter V deals with the machinery at all-Wales level.    in deference to the views expressed by my colleagues, I have abandonedmy previous proposals for an elected Council with some executive functions.    On 19th June the Environmental Planning Committee (whodealt with this chapter by arrangement with the Home AffairsCommittee) approved my revised proposals.    All that is now said isthat:DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

introduction. This White Paper sets out for public discussion the Government^ proposalsfor reorganising local government in Wales.2. The Government decided to proceed with this reorganisation instead of including Wales within the terms of reference of the Royal Commissions on local Government in England and Scotland for two reasons. In the firstplace, the need for early action is particularly urgent in Wales where a verylarge number of authorities lack the resources to discharge their functions as fully and effectively as modern conditions increasingly demand. One county,for instance, has a smaller population than have some parishes elsewhere andno fewer than 12 municipal boroughs and 31 urban districts (that is, just over two-fifths of the total number) have populations of less than 5,000* and (with one exception) a penny rate product of less than  600. Many of these smallauthorities are facing increasingly serious difficulties in securing expert staffs,in placing economically large orders for goods and equipment and in copingwith contingencies that larger authorities can take in their stride. Secondly,at the time the Royal Commissions were set up, consideration of the reorganisa-tion of local government throughout Wales was well advanced as a result ofthe work of the Local Government Commission for Wales set up under theLocal Government Act 1958 and of the further work put in hand by the Secretaryof State for Wales in 1965. This work had reached a point where it was apparent that local government in the Principality could be reorganised on lines thatwould secure its early strengthening.3. The Local Government Commission in its first report produced in 1961put forward draft proposals for creating, substantially by amalgamation,five administrative counties instead of the existing 13, the more densely populated areas of the north and south being associated with the more sparsely populated areas of Mid Wales. The 1961 report also proposed extensions to the county boroughs of Cardiff and Newport, a minor adjustment of the boundary ofSwansea, the conversion of the county borough of Merthyr Tydfil into anon-county borough, and the rejection of suggestions that the non-county boroughs of Rhondda and Wrexham should be made county boroughs. Theseproposals met with opposition and, after conferences with local authoritiesand other interested bodies, the Commission, in their final report,! adhered inthe main to their recommendations about the county boroughs but proposedthat there should be seven rather than live new counties. At the heart of their final proposals for the counties was the concept of a Mid Wales county created by the amalgamation of Montgomeryshire, Radnorshire, most of Breconshireand parts of Merioneth and Cardiganshire.   Pembrokeshire and Carmarthen-* Appendix 1a shows the distribution of the existing authorities by size of population,t Local Government Commission for Wales:Draft proposals.

shire were to be joined with the rest of Cardiganshire, and Flintshire was to bejoined with most of Denbighshire and with part of Merioneth. Glamorganand Monmouthshire were each to take in a part of Breconshire, and the wholeof the Rhymney Valley was to be transferred from Glamorgan to Monmouth-shire. Caernarvonshire was to be combined with part of western Denbighshireand the remainder of Merioneth. Only Anglesey was to remain untouched.This final report also had a mixed reception on publication and the Commission^proposals were again opposed by many local authorities. Further, it was generally accepted that the Commission had, as they themselves emphasised,been limited by the exclusion of functions and finance from their terms of refer-ence. The Government of the day did not feel that they should implement the Commission^ recommendations* and undertook to prepare proposalsthemselves.4. The Secretary of State for Wales set up in 1965 an Inter-DepartmentalWorking Partyf to help him to examine the functions and boundaries of allclasses of local authorities in Wales. He was anxious that this review shouldnot proceed in isolation from local authority opinion and arrangements weremade for the Working Party to consult informally a number of people whosenames were suggested by the local authority associations for their knowledge and experience of local government in Wales. In the views expressed by theseinformal advisers the Working Party distinguished three broad lines of thought:(a) that the existing structure should be retained, but with substantiallyfewer and stronger authorities;(b) that the existing structure should be replaced by a single tier of all-purposeauthorities; and(c) that some kind of regional or sub-regional local authority should be formed.The Working Party examined (a) and (b) by constructing two hypotheticalmodels and they also tentatively sketched possible functions and constitution for an all-Wales council. This work was conveyed to the informal advisers inan interim memorandum and they were asked, in confidence, for their viewson the alternatives put forward and for suggestions for improvements. Amajority favoured (a), a substantial minority favoured (b), and opinion wasabout equally divided on the suggestions for a possible regional authority.The carefully reasoned and detailed criticisms made by the advisers and their suggestions for improvements greatly helped in the preparation of the present proposals.* The Commission^ recommendations for the county boroughs of Cardiff, Newport andSwansea were, however, examined and inquiries were held into objections to them. TheSecretary of State announced his decisions in May, 1965, and orders have since been madebringing into effect boundary changes for Newport and Cardiff.t The Working Party comprised senior officers from the Welsh Office, Welsh Board ofHealth, Ministry of Health, Education Office for Wales of the Department of Education and science, Home Office and Ministry of Housing and Local Government together withProfessor Ivor Gowan of the Department of Political Science at the University College of wales, Aberystwyth.
mDEFECTS AND REMEDIES5. The first question that the Inter-Departmental Working Party put totheir informal advisers was: what are the defects in the existing organisation?Nearly all the answers were to the effect that the main defect lies in the largeproportion of existing authorities that are too small to discharge their responsi-bilities effectively.The smallness and weakness of authorities6. Although size alone, however measured, cannot be the sole determinantof efficiency, it has become increasingly apparent that for all the main countyfunctions that is, those concerned with the administration of town and country planning, education, personal health and welfare, police, fire, and civil defence,the construction and maintenance of roads and bridges, and traffic management modern conditions require large administrative units. For effective admini-stration an authority must be able not only to employ chief officers of standingbut to support them with staffs of adequate numbers, quality, and specialisedskills. The large authority is better able than the small to provide the conditionsof service, the career structure and the scope for the exercise of specialisedprofessional skills which are needed to attract and retain sufficient good-quality staff. Again, the increasing complexity and expense of modern equip-ment and buildings often put them beyond the resources of small authorities.7. The Local Government Commission devoted considerable attention tothe problem of size in relation to the county unit and discussed in detail theadministration of the principal county services in Wales as they then foundthem. They concluded that &quot;the increasing need of the various branchesof each service for specially trained staff cannot be met by small authorities&quot;*and took the view that:&quot;... in general, authorities should be large enough to employ properlytrained staff in all the main branches of their functions, to provide institu-tions of a variety more widespread than, in some cases, their presentresources permit, and to be capable of something more than mere mainte-nance of a standard of service barely sufficient to stave off adverse criticism from the public, from the press, or from the overseeing GovernmentDepartment.&quot;!The Local Government Commission also said:&quot;... we do not claim that efficiency automatically increases with size;we have never claimed to have discovered the optimum size for the greatesteffectiveness of county administrative units; we have made no attempt to prove inefficiency on the part of any particular county. Our propositionis simply that there is a minimum size in terms of population and resourcesbelow which the full range of county functions cannot be effectivelycarried out.   We believe that, in general, and subject to the possible* Report and Proposals for Wales (loc. cit.), paragraph 358.t Ibid, paragraph 357.
existence of exceptional cases, many of our Welsh counties fall below thatminimum, and that accordingly it is desirable, in the interest of effectivelocal government and of the people whom local government exists toserve, that the smaller Welsh counties should be replaced by largeradministrative units.&quot;*8. The sizes of county boroughs recommended by the Commission wereone (Cardiff) with a population of over 250,000, and two (Swansea and Newport)with populations of over 100,000. The sizes of counties they recommended in their draft proposals were four with populations ranging between 316,000and 799,000 and one with a population of 213,000. Their final proposalsfor seven counties provided for four with populations ranging between 280,000and 729,000, one (Gwynedd) with 184,000, another (Mid Wales) with127,000 and one (Anglesey) with only 52,000.9. Nothing has emerged from the views expressed by the majority of the informal local authority advisers or from the experience of GovernmentDepartments to question either the validity of the views on size expressed bythe Local Government Commission for Wales or the need to increase the size of the units discharging the main county services in Wales at least to the extentproposed by the commission.10. Indeed in at least two respects the Commission did not go far enough.In the first place, subsequent experience has shown that the authorities proposedby the Commission were not large enough for all purposes. For instance, a substantially wider perspective than that which the Commission^ proposedauthorities could have is needed to consider policies for land use and economic development and it was primarily because of the need to look at Wales as awhole for these purposes that the Welsh Economic Council was created.Similarly, in the interests of police efficiency, the Home Secretary has found itnecessary to propose amalgamations that will reduce the number of the Welshpolice forces to four. In the second place, the Commission^ final proposalsincluded one county unit that would be very small and acceptance of the irrecommendation for this unit would create strong pressure for the retentionof other similar-sized authorities which would be too small to discharge effectivelytheir responsibility for the main services.11. The functions now exercised at county district level were outside theterms of reference of the Local Government Commission. Evidence to theRoyal Commission on Local Government in England has suggested that someof the more important of them, such as house building and sewage disposal,should be done by units no smaller than those proposed by the Local Govern-ment Commission for most of their new counties and county boroughs. On theother hand, other district functions, such as the management of housing estatesand the collection of refuse, do not need to be done by such large authorities.Moreover, considerations of administrative efficiency are not the only onesthat have to be taken into account. Whatever may be the conclusions of theRoyal Commissions it is apparent that the existing second-tier authorities in wales are too numerous and, for the most part, too small for efficient operation in modern conditions. While it may be difficult to establish a theoreticalcriterion of size for an ideal county district in Wales, examination of geographical
and other circumstances has shown how existing districts could be convenientlyamalgamated to produce new second-tier authorities that would be neither sonumerous as to defeat the purposes of reorganisation nor so few as to makesubdivision of the first tier unnecessary.Reorganisation based on the all-purpose authority12. Some of the informal advisers advocated that the most logical way ofremedying the present defects would be to create a single tier of authoritieseach of which would have full responsibility for the local authority services inits area. This kind of authority has long been accepted as appropriate for large urban areas. Because these authorities would deal with all the different services now performed by the different tiers, uncertainty in the public mindabout responsibility for each service would be ended and the greater opportunities -ties for co-operation between services would lead to increased efficiency. Thereare, for example, advantages in linking the administration of the personal health and welfare services with that of housing, environmental health and thecontrol of communicable disease, and also in linking housing with town and country planning. It was contended that a single council responsible for allthese services would be well placed to promote the links between them and totake advantage of any possibilities of economising in the office and other facilities which they all need. Such a council would have the benefit of theresources in staff and equipment of both the county and district councils in itsarea and could be expected, through the rationalisation of administration, tobe able to make better use of them. Furthermore, this system would improvefinancial discipline by making the authority responsible for the spending alsoresponsible for finding the means.13. There would, however, be serious difficulties in carrying out a reorganisation -sation of local government in Wales on this basis at present. The modelprepared by the Inter-Departmental Working Party suggested that a choicehas to be made between, on the one hand, having a very small number of authorities administering all the main services over wide areas, and, on theother, having such a large number of authorities that the efficiency of importantfunctions like town and country planning and education would be prejudiced.This dilemma is particularly acute in the large area of rural Wales where thepopulation and rateable resources are small and scattered, communications arepoor and there are few convenient centres. To achieve the population andrateable resources desirable for the efficient discharge of the main countyservices, the authorities serving this large area would have to be no more than two or three in number. Again, in industrial South Wales, where the valleycommunity pattern of settlement is different from that found in most otherparts of Britain, the creation of acceptable all-purpose authorities would involvethe replacement of some of the largest and most comprehensively equippedauthorities in Wales by entirely new authorities of a kind not hitherto authori-tatively recommended for such areas.Reorganisation based on a tier structure14. The main alternative to having most functions discharged by a singleclass of authority is to have a tier structure which provides for those functionsthat can be carried out by small authorities close to the people to be so carried
out and for those functions that need to be organised over a large area to be soorganised. A good starting point for working out the details of a solution onthese lines was provided by the work done by the Local Government Commis-sion. The further work done by the Inter-Departmental Working Party withthe help of the informal advisers has shown how the principal defects in theexisting organisation could be remedied by reducing the number and increasingthe size of the present units. The Government consider that this kind ofevolutionary reform is appropriate to Wales at the present time. Their present proposals, therefore, are aimed essentially at amalgamating authorities which need to be amalgamated and at making such changes in functions and financeas are required by these amalgamations. It is accepted that there may, atleast for a time, be some differences between Wales and the rest of Britain as indeed there may continue to be differences between Scotland and England,and, within England, between London and the remainder. But some differencesmay in any case be justified for geographical and historical reasons, and thetheoretical advantages of securing complete uniformity at all times would not justify delaying the reforms that all who have studied the problem are convincedare urgently needed in Wales.15. This is not to say that Wales is to be precluded from benefiting from theresults of the fundamental inquiry into local government being carried out by theRoyal Commissions on Local Government in England and Scotland. If experi-ence of the working of the new system in Wales and of the changes decided on for England and Scotland after the Royal Commissions have reported showthat further adjustments of the Welsh local government system is desirable, theGovernment will ensure that such adjustment is made at an appropriate time.
THE NEW AREAS16. Many of the informal advisers to the Inter-Departmental Working Partyexpressed themselves in favour of the final proposals of the Local government commission for Wales although some of them preferred the draft proposals.Their comments, the public reaction when the Commission^ proposals were published, and the subsequent consideration given by Government Departmentsprovide the basis for the pattern of areas now proposed.The County Boroughs17. The Local Government Commission^ view that Cardiff, Newport andSwansea should be retained as county boroughs is accepted. The revisedboundaries recommended by the Commission for these have, with some smallmodifications, already been approved by the Secretary of State. The LocalGovernment Commission made a convincing case for regarding MerthyrTydfil as too small and too lacking in resources to continue to carry out in modern conditions the full range of county borough functions and this case isstrengthened by the further decline in its population since the Commission^report was published.The Counties18. In presenting their draft proposals the Local Government commission had in mind &quot;that in order not to offend unnecessarily public sentiment andlocal patriotism it was desirable to avoid, so far as possible,breaking up existingcounties and to proceed rather by the amalgamation of substantially wholecounties.&quot;* They reconsidered this in their final report, largely because of theneed to facilitate a solution to what they saw as a major problem the creationof a viable administrative county in Mid Wales and they recommended thedismemberment of many counties. But it appears from subsequent public discussion and from the work of the Inter-Departmental Working Party thatthe principle of amalgamating existing units with as few departures as possible is a course which has substantial advantages.19. The proposed new counties (and possible names for themf) are:Gwynedd(Population 553,460; area 1,554,853 acres; rateable value  18,621,685)This would be an amalgamation of Anglesey, Caernarvonshire, Denbighshire,Flintshire and Merioneth, and would be a similar combination to that proposed as one possible basis of reorganisation in the 1947 Report of the Local Govern-ment Boundary Commission, under the chairmanship of Sir Malcolm TrustramEve.   It would be a large county but not as large as some English and Scottish* Report and Proposals for Wales (loc. cit.), paragraph 549(c).t These names are suggested because of their historical associations as well as theirshortness and pronounceability.
counties and certainly not too large to be administratively unmanageable. Withits population of over half a million and its rateable value of nearly  19 millionit would constitute a strong unit of local government.Powys(Population 116,470; area-1,280,556 acres; rateable value  2,718,239)This would be an amalgamation of Montgomeryshire, Radnorshire andBreconshire. The problem of providing a fully effective administration forthese three counties cannot be solved solely within the context of local govern-ment reorganisation. Within that context, resources for an effective countyunit could be found only be attaching the present authorities to their moreprosperous neighbours as the Local Government Commission suggested intheir draft proposals. But rather than seek to include in Mid Wales areas thatwould more naturally form part of North or South Wales authorities, or areaslying to the west of the Pumlumon range that would more naturally form partof a West Wales authority, it would be better to accept a unified administrationof what is a reasonably homogeneous area, even though its resources are poor.The Government are supporting this choice with measures for the strengthening of the population, economy and rateable resources of the area.Dyfed(Population-316,640; area-1,428,851 acres; rateable value- 8,829,799)This would be an amalgamation of Cardiganshire, Carmarthenshire andPembrokeshire. The Local Government Commission pointed to the commonhistorical traditions of most of this area and to its &quot;unity of interest, bothsocial and economic, which rests on a geographical basis.&quot;* The Commissionproposed boundary alterations between Carmarthenshire and Glamorgan andthese would be carried out except for the proposal to transfer the communitiesof Hendy and Fforest to Glamorgan, the case for which is less strong than thatfor the changes proposed in the Amman Valley.Glamorgan(Population-721,820; area-441,989 acres; rateable value- 22,345,552)This would be the existing county except for the inclusion of Merthyr Tydfiland the exclusion of the Rhymney Valley (which the Commission rightly arguedshould be included in Monmouthshire) and the boundary alterations mentionedfor Dyfed.Gwent(Population-419,900; area-371,280 acres; rateable value- 12,122,959)This would be the existing county of Monmouthshire with the addition ofthe Rhymney Valley.The County Districts20. Outside the industrial areas it is not possible to create significantlystronger district authorities without amalgamating boroughs and urban districtswith rural districts, so creating districts with both urban and rural characteristics,and it would be difficult to classify the new districts as either urban or rural. Itis proposed, therefore, that the distinction between urban districts and rural districts should be dropped.
21. The proposed distribution of new districts (as well as of the new counties)is shown in detail in Appendix 2 and on the Map. The general principlesfollowed have been to preserve as far as possible the identity of existing smallcounties, and also, as far as possible, to amalgamate existing districts as wholeunits. As explained in paragraph 11, the proposals have been based on an examination of the geographical and other circumstances within the new countiesrather than on the application of a theoretical criterion of size. The objectivehas been to distinguish largely homogeneous areas with adequate resources,community of interest, good communications and suitable administrativecentres. This examination has pointed to the replacement of the existing 164non-county boroughs and urban and rural districts (with their average populationof under 13,000) and the county borough of Merthyr Tydfil by 36 districts withan average population of nearly 60,000. The size distribution of the proposed new districts, compared with that of the existing authorities, is shown inAppendix 1.22. Considerations affecting the distribution within each county are breifly as follows:Gwynedd In accordance with the aim of maintaining the identity of existingsmall counties, Anglesey and Merioneth (except for Edeyrnion Rural Districtwhich the Local Government Commission thought to be more properlyassociated with the authorities to the north and east of it than left with the restof Merioneth) would become single districts. Caernarvonshire would be divided into three districts largely because of the desirability of retaining the historical and topographical distinctions between the north-western coastalplain communities, the Conway hinterland and the Lleyn Peninsula. Thepresent counties of Denbighshire and Flintshire are also too large to be consti-tuted as single districts and an attempt has been made, therefore, to group as nearly as possible homogeneous communities or areas having community ofinterest.Powys The same difficulty poverty of resources in sparsely populated rural areas arises with the districts as with the county itself. The proposed distribu-tion is, despite the very small population of District 2 which comprises the presentcounty of Radnorshire, the nearest to a workable system obtainable.Dyfed The creation of a district covering both sides of the Teifi Valley wouldbe desirable and the proposed distribution of the other districts follows fromthis starting point.Glamorgan Most of the combinations proposed fall into recognisable,physically associated, groups. Because of the planning problems facing the congested mining valleys an attempt has been made to associate them withadjoining localities which have greater scope for industrial and housing develop-ment.Gwent As in Glamorgan, the proposed distribution of districts largely followsfrom the topography. The large District 6 with its high potential in rateable value would be preferable to a further split of this side of the county into twodistricts of approximately equal areas but vastly different rateable resources.The Parish23. The big reduction in number of, and increase of size in, district councilspoint to the retention and strengthening of the rural parish administration.  In
the present rural districts it is the parish meeting and the parish council which provide the highest degree of local representativeness. They are responsiblefor some executive functions and they are a ready-made focus for local opinionat village level. But the parishes would be more effective in carrying out their executive functions and in providing sounding boards for local opinion if thesmaller among them were amalgamated. Because it would need an intimate knowledge of each locality the process of amalgamation would be best carriedout by the new county councils who would be required to begin their reviewsas soon as they were set up.24. For local government purposes there is no parallel in the present boroughs and urban districts to the civil parish in rural areas. But the need for a morelocal representative body than the district council may be felt in parts of thenew district other than those that were formerly rural areas. There is noreason why this need should not be met if local opinion favoured this. It isproposed, therefore, to require the new county councils to review formerboroughs and urban districts with a view to prescribing areas, which would normally be single communities, where such organisations could be set up.The decision whether or not to set them up would be one for the local electors.If they decided that there should be such an organisation for their particular area, a council would be constituted with the same powers as the council of a rural parish. If the electors did not want such a council, the new districtcouncil would exercise in that area the powers which the &quot;parish&quot; organisation would otherwise have had. The new councils and, indeed, their rural counter-parts might be known as &quot;common councils&quot;. To avoid dislocation duringthe interim period before the county councils conclude their review, the existingborough and urban district councils should continue during this time, althoughwith the powers only of common councils.Dignities and privileges of boroughs25. The inclusion of boroughs in the new districts makes it necessary toconsider the future of their charter dignities, privileges, rights and obligations.It was seen that a similar question would arise following the reviews requiredto be carried out by county councils under the Local Government Act 1958,and that Act, therefore, provided a solution. Where a borough and an urban district were amalgamated, or parts of an urban or rural district were added toa borough, the entire new district would become a borough, the dignities ofthe old borough becoming vested in the new. Where, on the other hand, the borough was merged with a rural district, the new area would remain a rural district and the borough would lose its status as a county district though remain-ing a chartered corporation. Apart from keeping its charter and local actpowers and continuing to hold corporate land and property, its statutory powers would be broadly those of a parish council. Its council would consistof a mayor and councillors but no aldermen. Its clerk would be styled TownClerk and it would have greater freedom in the appointment of officers than aparish council.26. It would be consistent with what was said in paragraph 20, to discontinue the distinction between boroughs and other authorities, as well as that betweenurban and rural districts. But there is much local attachment to dignities and privileges many of which are often of long standing, it cannot be said that their
discontinuation is essential in the interests of remedying the main defects inthe present organisation and there would be natural opposition to their dis-continuation in Wales in advance of whatever may be decided in the case ofthe English boroughs.27. A solution similar to that contained in the 1958 Act would be applicableto most Welsh boroughs. More than half of them are very small and couldbe covered by provisions on the lines of those in the 1958 Act for boroughsincluded in rural districts. Others of them are large and, if other urban orrural districts, in whole or in part, were added to them, their dignities could be vested in the whole of the new district. For some others the appropriatearrangements might require special consideration in the light of local circum-stances, and it could be provided that, where arrangements on the lines of the1958 Act were not acceptable to the authorities involved, the new countiesmight, after discussion with those authorities, propose other arrangements tothe Secretary of State.Further adjustments of boundaries28. It has not been possible to examine in detail the anomalies which could arise on all the new district boundaries or indeed (despite the work already done by the Local Government Commission) all the county boundaries. nor would it be desirable for the legislation setting up the new authorities to try tosettle these boundaries precisely for all time. Consideration will be given,therefore, to providing simplified procedures for correcting anomalies after thenew authorities have been set up.
FUNCTIONS, FINANCE AND STAFF29. The present proposals are aimed essentially at amalgamating authorities within the existing structure without making greater changes in the presentpattern of functions than are required as a result of amalgamation.The general responsibilities of the new county, county borough and districtcouncils30. The new county councils should, therefore, have responsibility for thesame functions as the present authorities, notably, education, personal health and welfare, child care, civil defence, town and country planning, roads and traffic management on other than trunk roads, promotional and advisoryactivities on road safety, weights and measures, animal health, composition and description of food and drugs, smallholdings, and the registration of vehicles, births and deaths. They would fit in well with the four new amalga-mated police authorities which are now being established: one for North Wales(corresponding to the new county of Gwynedd) one for Mid-Wales (correspond-ing to Dyfed and Powys) one for the geographical county of Glamorgan(covering the new administrative county and the county boroughs) and one for&apos;Monmouthshire (covering Gwent and Newport). Responsibility for theambulance service would need to be determined in accordance with the conclu-sions finally reached by the Minister of Health on proposals already made.Responsibility for the fire service would be determined when the HomeSecretary has considered the views of the Departmental Committee which hehas set up to inquire into this service..&apos;,&apos; -    &apos;31. The county borough councils should continue to have the functionsboth of county and district councils.32. The new district councils should take the place of the existing non-county borough, urban district and rural district councils and be empowered toexercise uniformly throughout their districts the general powers which existing legislation gives to these three kinds of authority. Their main responsibilities would be for housing, environmental health, control of communicable disease,coast protection, hygiene and sanitary arrangements for food (including meat,and milk), markets, car parks, physical training and recreation, and the ShopsActs. Some of the new districts, particularly former counties which, as such,had previously exercised library powers, and some existing library authoritiesin the larger urban centres, might be able to make a strong case to the Secretaryof State for Education and Science to be considered as suitable bodies to exerciselibrary powers for their areas.Delegation33. Under the Education Act 1944, the Local Government Act 1958, theHighways Act 1959 and the Town and Country Planning Act 1962, certain countyresponsibilities may be delegated to, or claimed by, district authorities possessing
certain qualifications. In the case of education, non-county borough and urban district councils with populations of 60,000 or more may, at various intervals,claim substantial responsibilities for running their local service and, wherethere are exceptional circumstances, district councils of less than this size may apply for some delegated functions. Alongside the resulting &quot;excepted districts&quot;the county councils can operate schemes of divisional administration by executiveauthorities consisting of bodies of persons set up for the purpose of exercisingspecified functions relating to primary and secondary education. These bodiesinclude, but need not be entirely composed of, members of the county counciland of constituent district councils. In the case of most of the personal health and welfare functions, the council of any non-county borough or urban districtwith a population of over 60,000 may, at various intervals, claim delegation of substantial responsibilities from the county and, where there are special circum-stances, non-county borough or urban district councils with smaller populationsthan this, or any rural district council, may, with the consent of the Ministerof Health, make delegation schemes. In the case of town and country planning,district councils with populations of 60,000 or more may claim to exercisesubstantial day-to-day planning control functions and district councils of lessthan this population may, with the consent of the Secretary of State for Wales,be given similar delegated responsibilities. In the case of classified roads, a county council may delegate its responsibility for maintenance and improvementto the councils of non-county boroughs and urban and rural districts, and the council&apos;s of non-county boroughs and urban districts with a population of over20,000 may claim to look after the county roads in their areas. The responsibilityfor unclassified roads in non-county boroughs and urban districts falls on therespective councils but that for unclassified roads in rural districts falls on thecounty councils who may delegate their functions to the rural district councils.34. The problem presented by these arrangements is that if after reorganisationthey were maintained so that all the new districts with sufficiently large popula-tions were able to claim delegation in the same way as non-county boroughs,urban districts and rural districts can at present, there would be a decentralisation-tion of responsibility to second-tier authorities which would offset the reductionin the number of first-tier authorities. Thus, for education, personal health and welfare and town and country planning, at least one district in Gwynedd,one in Dyfed, four out of six in Gwent and all but one in Glamorgan couldclaim to be excepted districts for education and to have transferred to themresponsibilities for most personal health and welfare services and for day-to-dayplanning control. The effect of this would be that there would be more authori-ties in Wales dealing with these important services as of right after reorganisationthan there are now (22 as compared with the present 18 for education and personal health and welfare and 19 for town and country planning), the countyadministrations of Glamorgan and Gwent would be seriously weakened andsome new districts would be permitted to assume responsibilities althoughexisting counties of only slightly smaller populations would have been divestedof these. The problem is even more serious for roads. All the new districtscould claim to look after the unclassified roads and all except one to look after all the county roads in their area. This would largely destroy the countiesas highway authorities.35. It would be a drastic step, in the context of the present Welsh localgovernment reorganisation, to amend existing legislation so as to prohibit
certain qualifications. In the case of education, non-county borough and urban district councils with populations of 60,000 or more may, at various intervals,claim substantial responsibilities for running their local service and, wherethere are exceptional circumstances, district councils of less than this size may apply for some delegated functions. Alongside the resulting &quot;excepted districts&quot;the county councils can operate schemes of divisional administration by executiveauthorities consisting of bodies of persons set up for the purpose of exercisingspecified functions relating to primary and secondary education. These bodiesinclude, but need not be entirely composed of, members of the county counciland of constituent district councils. In the case of most of the personal health and welfare functions, the council of any non-county borough or urban districtwith a population of over 60,000 may, at various intervals, claim delegation of substantial responsibilities from the county and, where there are special circum-stances, non-county borough or urban district councils with smaller populationsthan this, or any rural district council, may, with the consent of the Ministerof Health, make delegation schemes. In the case of town and country planning,district councils with populations of 60,000 or more may claim to exercisesubstantial day-to-day planning control functions and district councils of lessthan this population may, with the consent of the Secretary of State for Wales,be given similar delegated responsibilities. In the case of classified roads, a county council may delegate its responsibility for maintenance and improvementto the councils of non-county boroughs and urban and rural districts, and the council&apos;s of non-county boroughs and urban districts with a population of over20,000 may claim to look after the county roads in their areas. The responsibilityfor unclassified roads in non-county boroughs and urban districts falls on therespective councils but that for unclassified roads in rural districts falls on thecounty councils who may delegate their functions to the rural district councils,34. The problem presented by these arrangements is that if after reorganisationthey were maintained so that all the new districts with sufficiently large popula-tions were able to claim delegation in the same way as non-county boroughs,urban districts and rural districts can at present, there would be a decentralisation-tion of responsibility to second-tier authorities which would offset the reductionin the number of first-tier authorities. Thus, for education, personal health and welfare and town and country planning, at least one district in Gwynedd,one in Dyfed, four out of six in Gwent and all but one in Glamorgan couldclaim to be excepted districts for education and to have transferred to themresponsibilities for most personal health and welfare services and for day-to-dayplanning control. The effect of this would be that there would be more authori-ties in Wales dealing with these important services as of right after reorganisationthan there are now (22 as compared with the present 18 for education and personal health and welfare and 19 for town and country planning), the countyadministrations of Glamorgan and Gwent would be seriously weakened andsome new districts would be permitted to assume responsibilities althoughexisting counties of only slightly smaller populations would have been divestedof these. The problem is even more serious for roads. All the new districtscould claim to look after the unclassified roads and all except one to look after all the county roads in their area. This would largely destroy the countiesas highway authorities.35. It would be a drastic step, in the context of the present Welsh localgovernment reorganisation, to amend existing legislation so as to prohibit
any delegation of functions from the new counties to their districts. It isconsidered therefore that the best solution to the immediate problem in wales would be to provide for an interim period during which, notwithstandingexisting legislation, the new districts would not be able to claim delegation, thepresent schemes of delegation would be maintained and the GovernmentDepartments and local authorities concerned would work out such revised arrangements as might be appropriate. This would mean that the new counties and county boroughs would have responsibility for education, personal health and welfare, town and country planning and roads (other than trunk roads) intheir areas, but that, during the interim period or such shorter period as maybe needed to bring revised arrangements into operation with the agreement ofthe appropriate Minister, those of the 36 new districts which include non-county boroughs and urban or rural districts that now operate delegationschemes, would continue to operate those schemes. As regards the divisionalexecutives for education referred to in paragraph 33, no change would be madein the relevant part of the Education Act 1944. Thus, while existing schemesof delegation to divisional executives would lapse as the result of the disappear-ance of existing authorities, all the newly created county authorities wouldhave the same power as existing authorities to make new schemes of delegation to divisional executives, if they so wished, subject to the approval of the Secretaryof State for Education and Science.Other functions for which responsibilities are allocated between different classesof authorities36. There are three functions under this heading to which reference needs tobe made: weights and measures, animal diseases and the enforcement of pro-visions relating to the composition and description of food and drugs. the weights and measures authorities are the county and county borough councilsbut non-county borough or urban district councils with populations of 60,000or more can also take over this responsibility for their areas. Diseases of animalsare the responsibility of the counties and county boroughs and of non-county boroughs whose population was over 10,000 in 1881. The food and drugsauthorities are the counties and county boroughs and also the councils of non-county boroughs and urban districts with a population of 40,000 or more or(where directions are given by the Minister of Health) populations between20,000 and 40,000.37. Here, too, there is the problem that if the new districts inherited the powersof boroughs and urban districts, many of them would be able to claim responsi-bility for these functions. The result would be that although considerations of efficiency suggest that these functions ought to be discharged by a smaller number of larger authorities, there would instead be a substantial increase inthe number of Welsh authorities responsible for them. It is proposed that theresponsibility for these three functions should be undertaken by the new county and county borough councils and, at least for the interim period referred toin paragraph 35, by those of the new districts which both satisfy the populationrequirements of the existing legislation and include existing authorities which already discharge the responsibility. There would thus be 10 weights and measures authorities instead of 18, animal disease would be dealt with by 12authorities instead of 20, and there would be 16 food and drugs authoritiesinstead of 24.
The functions of common councils38. The replacement of the existing county districts and boroughs by a smaller number of much larger districts suggests that the common councilsreferred to in paragraph 24 should not only be strengthened by amalgamationsof the smaller parishes and by the provision of machinery for continuing thedignities and privileges of some of the existing boroughs, but should, generally,have a rather greater status than they possess today. It would defeat the main object of reorganisation if the executive responsibilities of the higher tiers were transferred to them. But they could retain the present executive powers ofparishes and a small but useful addition could be made to these powers by allowing them a little more flexibility than at present in their expenditure. Likeall other local authorities, parish councils are bound by the doctrine of ultravires, i.e., their administrative power is limited by the statutes and they cannotlegally act outside the powers which the statutes give them. These limitationshave restricted the activities of councils and the existing dispensation by whichthey may spend up to one-fifth of a penny rate for any purpose which in the council&apos;s opinion is in the interests of their area or its inhabitants and for whichthey do not already have power to spend money has not helped substantially.To help the common councils to become more effective the limit of expenditure for these purposes should be raised.Further adjustment of functions39. As with boundaries, it may well be necessary in the light of experience to make further minor adjustments to the functions of the new Welsh localauthorities and the reorganisation legislation should therefore provide enablingpowers for this to be done by statutory orders.Finance40. It would not be appropriate in a reorganisation applying to Wales aloneto make more fundamental changes in the grant structure than those set out inthe White Paper of February 1966 on Local Government Finance, England andWales (Cmnd. 2923) or to anticipate the more drastic reform of local government finance referred to in paragraph 6 of that White Paper.41. But there is one change needed in the present financial arrangement under which the districts are the rate-collecting authorities and the countiesprecept on them. The counties have for a long time been responsible for much the greater part of local government expenditure and this would be just as trueunder the reorganisation now proposed. The responsibility for raising revenue would thus continue to be divorced from the responsibility for determining the level of the bulk of the spending. This would be undesirable and it isproposed, therefore, that in future the counties should become the ratingauthorities and that the districts and common councils should precept on them.42. Moreover, it is necessary to consider two separate kinds, of financial effect which might result from the proposed amalgamations of Welsh counties and districts into larger units namely, that .on the distribution of exchequer grants and that on local rates. As regards the first of these, the exact effect ofthe proposed amalgamations on the distribution of Exchequer grants cannotbe calculated at this stage.  But the geographical distribution of grants might
be affected by amalgamation. The treatment of particular factors like the composition and density of the population in the grant distribution formulaemight make it inevitable that the result of applying the formulae to a largeadministrative unit treated as a whole would be different from the net resultof applying the formulae separately to the original local authorities comprising the new unit. This might be particularly true where the new unit was made upof authorities with widely differing population characteristics and rate resources.Thus some of the new counties and districts might get rather more Exchequermoney than would their component parts in total if they had remained separate,while others might get rather less. While these differences should largelybalance each other, there might also be a small net effect on the total payable to wales although the extent of this would also depend on the relationship betweenthe changes in Wales and such changes as may take place in England. Asregards the rates, quite apart from any effects of amalgamation on the distribu-tion of Exchequer grants, there are now fairly substantial differences in ratepoundages between existing authorities, and ratepayers would gain or loseaccording to whether their existing rate poundage was more or less than thatneeded to be struck for the new, wider area.43. Among the main grounds of opposition to the reorganisation proposalsof the Local Government Commission for Wales were that they involved a shift of part of the burden of the poorer authorities to their neighbours, reduced thetotal share which Wales had of Government grants to local authorities, andrequired some fairly substantial changes in local rate poundages in order toharmonise the position within the new areas. The terms of reference of theCommission did not allow them to probe these problems and to recommendsolutions. The Government do not intend to allow the present proposals tobe prejudiced for similar reasons. The benefits to Wales of strengthening its existing local government organisation are too great to be lost because of short-term and localised financial ill-effects.44. It is proposed therefore that there should be a transitional period duringwhich the financial effects of the changes could be more closely estimated.During this period, of perhaps two years, Exchequer grants to each of the newunits would, in principle, be calculated by applying the grant distributionformulae to the present local authority areas forming part of these units.Financial adjustments during this period would thus be confined to the equalisation-tion of the rate poundage within each of the new districts after taking into accountpayment of Exchequer grant on the existing system. This equalisation could take place by limited steps. If during this transitional period it became apparent that the calculation of the grant on the basis of the new areas treated as units would result in significant differences in the amount of grant received, the transitional arrangements could be extended while consultations with the localauthorities took place and solutions to any problems were worked out. this approach would have the advantage of giving time for the general benefits oflocal government reorganisation to be realised, for the new authorities to settle in, and for any problems to be properly considered in the light of accurateestimates.Staff Commission45. The creation of new, stronger authorities would lead to the better deploy-ment of the staff employed in Welsh local government, would provide its
members with new opportunities and would be unlikel toy be materiallydisadvantageous to any of them. But, in the execution of the proposed changes and the establishment of new authorities, it is inevitable that there would be some dislocation and it is desirable that all staff should be afforded a fair, andreasonably uniform, standard of treatment. To this end, the government consider that there is a need to provide machinery of the kind employed in abroadly similar context for the reorganisation of local government in London.It is proposed, therefore, to include in the legislation giving effect to the feorgani-sation proposals, provision for a Welsh Staff Commission to consider and keep under review arrangements for the recruitment and transfer of all local govern-ment employees, to consider such staffing problems arising from the reorganisa-tion as might be referred to them by the Secretary of State and to advise him of steps needed to safeguard the interests of staff affected by the reorganisation.
A NEW COUNCIL FOR WALES46. Proposals have been made by various bodies and by some of the informallocal authority advisers that, as part of the reorganisation of local government,new machinery should be created at an all-Wales level. Consideration ofthese proposals must start with a consideration of what functions would bebetter performed by such machinery than under the existing system. It is onthis that the case for creating a new body must depend and it is this which willalso determine the constitutional form of any new body (whether it should consist of elected, indirectly elected or nominated members or combinationsof these kinds of members) and the way in which it should be financed and staffed.Possible executive Functions41. Some far-reaching suggestions have been put forward for an electedcouncil to take over the administration of certain central government services such as trunk roads and hospitals and also of certain services such as parts ofthe educational, and health and welfare services, town and country planning,police, fire and public water supply now run by the counties and county boroughsor by joint authorities. So far as present central government services areconcerned, such a change would require extensive alterations in existing legisla-tion and national administrative machinery and would require decisions onwider issues than can be properly decided in the context of the present reorganised-isation of local government in Wales.48. While there is a stronger case for a directly elected all-Wales Council totake over work done at present by joint authorities, so far as most of the existinglocal authority services are concerned, it would not be consistent to strengthen the local authorities for the better discharge of their functions and at the sametime transfer the most important of these functions elsewhere. Moreover, therewould be disadvantages in dividing responsibility for different parts of certain services, such as education and health and welfare. Again, although even thenew local authorities proposed in Chapter 111 will still be small from the pointof view of town and country planning and transport policy, both of which needwide perspectives, this deficiency could be met by developing the existing machinery for advisory work.Advisory and promotional work49. There is a need to improve the machinery which already exists on anall-Wales basis for advisory and promotional work. In response to widespreadpressure for a body to express Welsh opinion, a Council for Wales was set upin 1949 to provide a forum for the interchange of views and information on developments and trends in the economic and cultural fields and to inform theGovernment about the impact of Government activities on the life of the people.When the Welsh Economic Council was set up in 1965, the Secretary of Statefor Wales said that, because this would be taking over the economic work of
the Council for Wales, the latter Council would be discontinued and considera-tion given to the need for new machinery to cover its other work. The council was discontinued in the spring of 1966 and there is a gap to be rilled here, particu-larly in relation to the cultural field. Again, experience has suggested ways inwhich the Welsh Economic Council itself might be further developed. Thereare two Welsh promotional organisations the Welsh Tourist Board and theDevelopment Corporation for Wales which need to be strengthened and thereis certain other advisory and promotional work to be considered.50. As regards the cultural field, the main promotional machinery at present is the Welsh Arts Council (formerly the Welsh Committee of the Arts Council).The Arts Council was set up under Royal Charter to provide the channel for exchequer support of the arts and it and its subsidiary bodies consist of people with a special knowledge and experience of the subject. The last report of theformer Council for Wales dealt with the arts in Wales and recommended, among other things, that a liaison committee should be established to bring together,for deliberation and co-operation, bodies which could help in fostering the arts.It recommended also that three regional associations on the lines of that already formed in North-East England should be set up one each for North,West and South Wales. Good progress has already been made in establishingan association for North Wales and wherever other local interests desire toform similar associations for promoting the arts in particular parts of Wales(not necessarily in the three groupings suggested by the former Council) theywill be encouraged to do so. A new all-Wales authority could, however, dothe kind of work in considering developments and trends done by the formerCouncil for Wales. It could help to improve liaison in this field and it could also, without weakening the existing responsibilities of the Welsh Arts Council,encourage the arts in Wales, particularly where arrangements need to be madefor the whole country.51. The Welsh Economic Council has the Minister of State for Wales as chairman. Its members are drawn from industry, the trade unions, localgovernment and the University, and they have been appointed by the Secietaryof State to assist him in the formulation of plans and to advise him on the steps needed to implement these plans and on the implications for Walesof national economic policies. This work, which covers, among other things,the location and growth of population and industry and the improvementof transport, constitutes the essential framework for town and country planning,but less than half of the county and county borough planning authorities havemembers on the Council. It would strengthen the Council if the local planning authorities could participate more closely in this work. Moreover, it would help the local planning authorities to get the width of interest and perspectivethat is needed for all aspects of town and country planning and promote the close co-operation which is needed between neighbouring authorities if theyjoined in the work of advising the Secretary of State on major land use andeconomic planning matters. The Secretary of State and the local planning authorities would retain their present statutory responsibilities under theTown and Country Planning Acts. Experience has also suggested that itwould be right for the Council, like the old Council for Wales, to appoint itsown Chairman and publish its own reports.52. Efforts to attract industry to Wales, other than those of central govern-ment agencies, comprise those organised and financed in respect of particular
districts or areas by the local authorities concerned, and those organised for wales as a whole by the Development Corporation for Wales, which has been,until recently, financed entirely by Welsh business concerns. A weakness ofthe Corporation is that it does not sufficiently involve the local authorities, andthe Corporation is currently exploring the possibilities of bringing the latterin as members. There would be advantages in associating, through an all-Wales authority, the work done by the Development Corporation with otherpromotional and advisory activities and with the work of the local authorities.53. The Wales Tourist Board, which comprises representatives of the localauthorities and of the tourist industry, has the job of promoting the developmentof the Welsh holiday industry. Its work is now being expanded and, in viewof the great potential of this industry, there is a case for expanding it still further and for increasing the liaison between it and industrial promotion, general economic planning, etc. This might be done by associating through an all-Wales authority the work done by the Wales Tourist Board with other advisoryand promotional activities.54. In the heavily populated south-east corner of Wales there may be a case for establishing a conurbation transport authority on the lines proposed by theMinister of Transport in the White Paper on Transport Policy (Cmnd. 3057,paragraph 59). But apart from this possibility, transport planning for Walesgenerally should, to be fully effective, encompass the provision of all publicpassenger and freight services, the pattern of road, rail and air communications and the control of road traffic. Transport planning and land use planning areintimately related and ideally they should be handled by the same authorities.Even the enlarged first-tier authorities, described in Chapter III, will still notbe large enough to consider effectively issues affecting the whole of, or largeparts of, Wales, e.g. the major road/rail network and its relation to air and port services. An all-Wales authority could advise the Secretary of State andthe Minister of Transport on transport policy and planning in Wales, and couldstudy and make recommendations on transport in the general context of econo-mic and social planning and development. A passenger transport co-ordination -ing committee for Wales has already been set up by the Secretary of State and theMinister of Transport in association with the Welsh Economic Council andits work might appropriately be brought under the wing of an All-Walesauthority.55. Also linked with land use and economic planning is the work of theNational Parks Commission. This Commission is to be superseded by aCountryside Commission with rather greater powers than the present Commis-sion and with the additional function of encouraging the provision of opportunities -ties for the enjoyment of the countryside generally. If an all-Wales authoritywere made responsible for the advisory work in this field the planning of thenational parks, which cover a large part of the total area of Wales, could be closely associated with other Welsh planning and with the promotion of the tourist industry.56. Finally, machinery which brought together the Welsh counties and county boroughs might play a useful role in facilitating co-operative activity betweenthem without weakening their individual executive authority. The WelshJoint Education Committee, which comprises representatives of the local
education authorities together with a number of co-opted members, and whichhas among its functions those of providing a forum for discussing commonproblems and of securing a measure of co-ordination on policy throughoutWales, has already illustrated the benefits of such work. It is not suggested thatthe work of this Committee should now be taken over by a new authority, but thekind of work which has been done by it might be usefully developed in other fields (for example, the sharing of a modern computer installation, of expert advice on superannuation or a loans bureau) if an all-Wales body on which the counties and county boroughs were represented was set up. Where agreement was reached on the need for certain specific pieces of co-operative activity,the precise machinery to be created for these purposes would need to be setout in schemes for the approval of the appropriate Minister.Conclusions57. This review of the possible functions suggests that the merits of a new body to undertake important executive functions are not as yet clear. More-over, such a body would require substantial legislation and its creation would raise important questions which are not peculiar to Wales. On the other hand,there would be advantage in early action to improve the existing machinery(some of it peculiar to Wales) for advisory and promotional work. Althoughthe effective discharge of some such responsibilities (particularly the work in wales of the Countryside Commission and the financial support of promotionalwork) requires the creation of a statutory body, many of the improvements nowneeded could be effected without special legislation. It is proposed, therefore to take action in two stages (i) at the end of the present three-year term of office of the members of the Welsh Economic Council which expires next year,the existing advisory and promotional machinery will be strengthened as faras this can be done without special legislation (other than the forthcominglegislation to set up the Countryside Commission) and (ii) further consideration will subsequently be given, in the light of the Royal Commission^ reports andother developments, to the possibilities of a further strengthening of all-Walesmachinery by giving it additional powers and responsibilities and by makingappropriate changes in its membership and constitution.58. It is proposed that for the first stije there should be constituted a newall-Wales advisory and promotional body which would represent a developmentof the existing Welsh Economic Council and of organisations peculiar to wales particularly the previous Council for Wales, the Welsh Arts Council,the Development Corporation for Wales and the Wales Tourist Board. Thelast three would retain their existing executive responsibilities. The newauthority, which could fittingly resume the name of the previous Council for wales, would have the following responsibilities: To provide a forum for the interchange of views and information on developments in the economic and cultural fields, and to advise ok the implications for Wales of national policies.To assist in the formulation of plans for Wales having regard to the best use of its resources, and to advise the Secretary of State for Wales on majorland use and economic planning matters.To advise the Minister of Transport and the Secretary of State on trans-port policy and planning in Wales.To give advice on the national parks and countryside.
To advise on the arts in Wales, particularly where arrangements need to bemade on an all-Wales basis.To keep under review and help to promote the publicity and similar workfor encouraging industrial and tourist development in Wales done by theDevelopment Corporation and the Tourist Board.To encourage co-operation between the local authorities through schemes which would require the approval of the appropriate Ministers.59. It would be appropriate for the costs of the advisory work of theCouncil to be met by the Exchequer. The cost of promotional work would continue to be met as at present by the Wales Tourist Board, the development corporation, the Welsh Arts Council and the local authorities.60. The kind of advisory and promotional work proposed for the council for the first stage and any work that the Council might undertake in promotingco-operation between the local authorities point to its being composed of mem-bers drawn mainly from the local authorities, industry, the trade unions,Universities, the Welsh Arts Council, the Development Corporation and theWales Tourist Board. Appointments would be made by the Secretary ofState after appropriate consultations. The Council might have a membership of about forty whose geographical distribution should reflect broadly the dis-tribution of population and resources in Wales. The Council would need to constitute a number of committees for the discharge of its various functions.The composition of these should vary according to their function and theymight need to include members who were not members of the full Council:the composition and terms of reference of each committee should be agreed with the Secretary of State. Like the former Council for Wales, the council should elect its own chairman and its reports would be published. Like theformer Council, and the Welsh Economic Council, it should work in close contact with the various Government Departments and, to this end, the Secre-tary of State would appoint a small number of Government officials to work as assessors to the Council and its committees and also provide for civil servants to be seconded for work on the Council&apos;s secretariat. Local authorities might also second members of their staff for work with the Council.
CHAPTER VISUMMARY61. Because of the urgency of the need in Wales and because, as a result of thework of the Local Government Commission for Wales and subsequent work,reorganisation proposals were well advanced, the Government decided toproceed with a reorganisation of local government in the Principality instead of waiting until that in England and Scotland could be carried out following theRoyal Commissions&apos; reports (paragraph 2).62. The maindefects in the present Welsh organisation are that most of the localauthorities are too small and weak to discharge their responsibilities effectively.It is considered that the immediate action appropriate to remedy this defectshould consist of extensive amalgamations of existing authorities within thepresent tier structure together with such changes in functions and finance as would be involved by these amalgamations. Further adjustments might need to be made if experience of the working of the new system in Wales and of the changes decided on for England and Scotland showed them to be needed(paragraphs 5 to 15).63. The proposals put forward are:County boroughs(1) Merthyr Tydfil should cease to be a county borough. Cardiff, Newportand Swansea should retain this status with the revised boundariesalready approved by the Secretary of State (paragraph 17):Counties(2) The following five new administrative counties should replace thepresent 13 Gwynedd an amalgamation of Anglesey, Caernarvonshire, Denbigh-shire, Flintshire and Merioneth;Powys an amalgamation of Montgomeryshire, Radnorshire andBreconshire;Dyfed an amalgamation of Cardiganshire, Carmarthenshire andPembrokeshire;Glamorgan the existing county except for the Rhymney Valley;Gwent the existing county and the Rhymney Valley (paragraph 19 and appendix 2):Districts(3) 36 new districts, preserving where possible the identities of existingcounties which are to be amalgamated, should be created in place of thepresent 164 non-county boroughs, urban districts and rural districts andthe county borough of Merthyr Tydfil (paragraphs 20 to 22, appendices1 and 2 and map):Common Councils(4) The present parishes should be reorganised by the new counties so asto strengthen their ability to carry out their functions (paragraph 23):
(5) Councils, on similar lines to existing parish councils, should be set upin urban areas where the inhabitants so wish. These, and their ruralequivalents in the parishes, might be known as &quot;common councils&quot;(paragraph 24):Dignities and privileges of boroughs(6) Arrangements should be made for the continuance of the dignities and privileges of boroughs (paragraph 27):Further adjustments of boundaries(7) Provision should be made for making further adjustments in boundariesafter the new authorities have been set up (paragraph 28):County functions(8) The new county councils should have responsibility for the same func-tions as the present county councils, notably, education, personal health and welfare, child care, civil defence, town and country planning,roads, traffic management and road safety, weights and measures,animal health, composition and description of food and drugs, small-holdings, and the registration of vehicles, births and deaths (paragraph30):County borough functions(9) The county borough councils should continue to have the functionsboth of county and of district councils (paragraph 31):District functions(10) The new district councils should be empowered to exercise uniformlythroughout their districts the general powers which existing legislationgives to non-county borough, urban district and rural district councils.Their main responsibilities would be for housing, control of communi-cable disease, environmental health, hygiene and sanitary arrangementsfor food (including meat and milk), coast protection, markets, car parks,physical training and recreation, and the Shops Acts (paragraph 32):Delegation(11) There should be an interim period during which existing delegationschemes in the fields of education, personal health and welfare, town and country planning and roads would be maintained without extension by thenew districts and during which the Government Departments and iocalauthorities concerned would work out new arrangements. In the case ofdivisional educational executives, the present schemes would lapse as theresult of the disappearance of the existing authorities. But under theEducation Act 1944 it would be open to the new authorities to putforward new schemes for the approval of the Secretary of State for education and Science (paragraph 35):Other functions for which responsibilities are allocated between different classesof authority(12) The responsibility for weights and measures, animal diseases, and the enforcement of provisions relating to the composition of food and drugsshould be carried out by the new county and county borough councils and, at least for the interim period referred to at (11) above, by those ofthe new district councils which both satisfy the population requirements
of the existing legislation and include existing authorities which alreadydischarge the responsibility (paragraph 37):The functions of common councils(13) The limit of expenditure for purposes not otherwise authorised shouldbe raised (paragraph 38):Further adjustment of functions(14) The reorganisation legislation should enable further minor adjust-ments of functions to be made by statutory orders (paragraph 39):Finance(15) Until more fundamental changes are made in the local government financial system for England and Wales as a whole, the existing rate support grant arrangements should be retained for Wales. But the counties should become the rating authorities and the districts and common councils should precept on them (paragraphs 40 and 41):(16) To avoid any financial dislocation as the result of the new county and district organisation, there should be a transitional period of perhapstwo years during which financial adjustments would be confined to theequalisation of the rate poundages within each of the new districts.During this period the Exchequer grants payable to the new authorities would in principle be calculated by applying the grant distributionformulae to the present local authority units forming part of the new authorities. If during the transitional period it became apparent thatthe calculation of the grant on the basis of the new areas treated as units would result in significant differences in the amount of Exchequer grantreceived, the transitional arrangements would be extended while con-consultations with the local authorities took place and appropriate solutionsto any problems were worked out (paragraphs 42 to 44):Staff Commission(17) A Welsh Staff Commission should be set up to consider and keep underreview arrangements for the recruitment and transfer of all local govern-ment employees, to consider such staffing problems arising from there organisation as might be referred to them by the Secretary of State,and to advise the Secretary of State of steps needed to safeguard theinterests of staff affected by the reorganisation (paragraph 45).A new Council for Wales(18) As an evolution of the Welsh Economic Council and of certain organisa-tions peculiar to Wales (particularly the previous Council for Wales, the welsh Arts Council, the Development Corporation for Wales and theWales Tourist Board) early action should be taken to set up a new council for Wales which would initially have the following advisory and promoting-tional functions: To provide a forum for the interchange of views and information on developments in the economic and cultural fields and to advise on the implications for Wales of national policies.
To formulate development proposals for Wales having regard to thebest use of its resources and to advise the Secretary of State for Waleson major land use and economic planning matters.To advise the Minister of Transport and the Secretary of State on transport policy and planning in Wales.To give advice on the national parks and countryside.To advise on the arts in Wales particularly where arrangements need to be made on an all-Wales basis.To keep under review and help to promote the publicity and similar work for encouraging industrial and tourist development in Walesdone by the Development Corporation, the Tourist Board and other bodies.To encourage co-operation between the local authorities, throughschemes which would first require the approval of the appropriateMinisters (paragraphs 46-58):(19) The cost of the advisory work of the Council would be met by theExchequer and the cost of promotional work would be met as at present by existing agencies including the local authorities, all of which would retain their present executive responsibilities (paragraph 59):(20) The Council should initially consist of some 40 members drawn mainly from the local authorities, industry, the trades unions, the universities and the principal promotional bodies. Appointments to the council would be made by the Secretary of State, who should also be consulted about the composition and terms of reference of its committees. It wouldelect its own chairman and its reports would be published. The Secretaryof State would appoint a small number of Government officials to act asassessors to the Council and its committees and provide for civil servants to be seconded for work on the Council&apos;s secretariat. Local authorities might also second members of their staff for work with the Council(paragraphs 60 and 61):(21) Further consideration will be given by the Government in the light ofthe Royal Commission^ Reports and other developments to the possibilityof a further strengthening of all-Wales machinery by giving it additional powers and responsibilities and by making appropriate changes in its membership and constitution (paragraphs 48 and 57 and 59).
