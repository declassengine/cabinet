1967 REPORT ON PUBLIC EXPENDITURE TO 1971-72:AREAS OF CHOICEReport by the Public Expenditure Survey CommitteeDepartments have conducted the 1967 Survey of public expenditure in such away as to provide Ministers with a wide range of options on which to base their decisions about the future levels of public expenditure in the context of the planningoperation announced by the First Secretary of State on 10th November, 1966.2. The Public Expenditure Survey Committee&apos;s &quot; 1967 Report on public expenditure to 1971-72: Continuation of Existing Policies&quot; sets out the agreedinterdepartmental view of the prospective level of public expenditure annuallyto 1971-72, assuming that existing policies continue unchanged. Total public expenditure in 1970-71 (excluding expenditure on fixed assets by nationalised industries, etc., and debt interest, but including a contingency allowance of  250million, investment grants, SET additional payments and regional employmentpremiums, is forecast, at 1967 Survey prices, to be  16,155 million.3. Options have been prepared for Ministers in three separate contexts asfollows:(a) Defence expenditure is currently under study with the objective of securingsavings of the order of  200 million on the Defence Budget for 1970-71(which is  2,377 million at 1967 Survey prices) but which will be offset by additional economic aid consequential upon defence savingsoverseas which could amount to  30 million per annum.(b) Studies in depth (&quot; the Civil Reviews &quot;) have been prepared on the Roads,Housing, Education, Health and Welfare and Social Securityprogrammes, summaries of which are attached (Annex A).(c) Possible increases or reductions in the level of other civil expenditure,where appropriate, have been examined,, and are summarised in annex B.4. The objective set in the Civil Reviews and in the examination of other civil expenditure, so that Ministers might be given a wide range of options, wasto produce revised forecasts achieving (a) a reduction of 1\ per cent and (b) anincrease of 5 per cent on the 1970-71 forecasts in the 1966 Survey (revalued to1967 Survey prices), these being the latest forecasts available when the reviewsand supplementary examination of other civil expenditure were put in hand.The &quot; Reduced level &quot; and the &quot; Increased level &quot; of civil expenditure to which thisReport refers have been calculated in this way, the figures for 1968-69 and1969-70 providing an appropriate progression from 1967-68 to the adjustedforecast for 1970-71.5. The 1967 Survey forecasts are now available (and are set out in full in theCommittee^ Report on Public Expenditure to 1971-72: Continuation of existing policies) and are reproduced as appropriate in the summaries in Annexes A and B,to each of which is appended, where appropriate, an economic analysis of thepossible reduction or increase discussed, in relation to the 1967 Survey forecasts.
6. The following table summarises the relevant figures for 1970-71 from theCivil Reviews and the supplementary examination of civil expenditure:				  million		1970-71	1967	Survey prices	1966 Survey	Reduced	Increased	1967 Survey	forecast	level	level	forecastCivil review programmes	(1)	(2)	(3)	(4)(Annex A)				Roads    .........	715	661	751	728Housing............	1,105	1,021	1,160H	1,149Education (including Local				Libraries, etc.)	2,331	2,149*	2,441	2,312Health    ............	1,815	1,682*	1,907	1,818Social Security......	3,303	2,952f	3,352f	3,179	9,269	8,465	9,611	9,186Other civil expenditure				(a) Items considered in Annex B J	3,041	2,876	3,193	3,100(b) Others       .........	1,045	1,211	1,211	1,211Total   civil   forecast   (including				investment grants, SET additional				payments and (in columns (2), (3)				and (4)) REP; excluding contin-				gency allowance)        ......	13,355	12,552	14,015	13,497* Includes withdrawal of some services as an alternative to new or increased charges,t The increased and reduced levels are measured against the 1967 Survey figure before the decisionto reduce the 1967 uprating, i.e.,  3,192 million (see Annex A, Item V, paragraph 5).I Includes investment grants.5 Items so dependent on extraneous factors or so small that specific increases or reductions in1970-71 of the order contemplated could not be forecast: consequently no change appears in thecentral columns.II Excludes the further increase of  47 million proposed by the Housing Departments (see Annex A,Item II, paragraph 7).7. It is emphasised that the reduced and increased levels of expenditure inthe above table in no sense represent any degree of inter-departmental agreement,commitment or recommendation that the policy changes which would be requiredto effect them should be adopted, nor even that alternatives of this order are desirable. To achieve the lower levels of expenditure would be quite impossible without some serious policy decisions of a major character; and the higher levelincludes items which would require further consideration before approval.8. It should be borne in mind that over  3,000 million of the forecast civil expenditure in 1970-71 relates to local authority current expenditure over whichthere is no direct central Government control. The Government can exercisesome influence through its encouragement to local authorities to economise in their services and through the Rate Support Grant. The level of Rate Support grant for 1968-69 has however already been determined and could not be varied without legislation.9. References to the relevant Sections of Part Three of the Committee&apos;s1967 Report on Public Expenditure to 1971-72: Continuation of Existing Policiesare included in Annexes A (Summaries of Civil Reviews) and B (Other civil expenditure). Material relating to the options in New Towns expenditure is brought together in Annex C; forecasts of relevant expenditure on existing policiesare set out in Annex 2 to Part Three of that Report.10.   The object of the present paper is to indicate in summary form areas inwhich options are available to Ministers.   The extent to which these optionsrepresent practical possibilities will need to be determined.  The paper sets out&apos; the basic information needed for decisions which will:(a) moderate the prospective rise of total public expenditure particularly in1968-69 and 1970-71; and(b) reshape the pattern over the next few years so as to give more adequateexpression to the Government&apos;s priorities.

ANNEX ASUMMARIES OF CIVIL REVIEWSI.   ROAD PROGRAMME: CIVIL REVIEW (SUMMARY)Projected expenditure rises rapidly, from about  560 million in Great britain in 1967-68 to  630 million in 1968-69 and  716 million in 1970-71. These totalstake account of deferments in 1965 and 1966. (The 1970-71 total consists of nearly  420 million on major roads,  75 million on other roads, car parks,lighting, etc, and  220 million on maintenance, etc. The great part of the increase is  120 million on major roads.)*2. The main reason is the growth of traffic: there were 7 million vehicles in 1956, 13-2 million in 1966 (including 9 million cars); in 1970, 17 million areexpected (12 million cars) and 21-22 million (17 million cars) by 1975. 10 percent of the roads in England and Wales carry two-thirds of the traffic and mostof the increase will be spent on these.3. There is no prospect of seriously diminishing these trends, e.g., maximum possible transfer of freight from road to rail would reduce mileage of all vehiclesby 1 per cent in 1972.England4. The programme as it stands, with increases of 5 per cent and reductions of 1\ per cent, is:  million       Percentage1967 Survey prices   increases 1967-68to 1970-71	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	Total	Per						annumNew construction and major						works        .........	309	367	393	428	38	11Maintenance.........	160	164	171	179	12	4Total   ............	472	534	567	610	29	9Plus 5 per cent       ......			19	30	36	11Minus lh per cent......		16	27	46	19	6(Both in 1970-71 and&quot; appropriate path &quot;thereto)The total would rise from  472 million to  640 million with the 5 per cent increase or to  564 million with the 1\ per cent reduction.5. As it stands the programme permits completion of 1,000 miles ofmotorway in England and Wales by 1974 (cf. 425 miles in use to-day), completionof 250 miles of all purpose trunk roads by 1970 and a rise from  100 million to 130 million on major urban improvements. But these expenditures will not prevent an increase in mileage &quot; overloaded &quot; by 100 per cent or more from1,450 miles in 1966 to 2,250 miles in 1970 nor similar proportional increases inthe mileage of road overloaded by 200 per cent or more and 300 per cent or more.The congestion is worse in towns and between main industrial centres; and since70 per cent of all goods traffic goes by road the economic loss is significant.6. Half the J per cent increase would go to increased maintenance costs:the remainder mainly to partial recovery of previously delayed trunk road schemes.7. The 7\ per cent decrease would fall entirely on capital works since any-further cut in maintenance is not practicable. The announced road programmeup to 1970 itself has already been cut by some  39 million as a result of the deferment measures of 1965 and 1966 and unadjusted price increases. Owingto the long time leads of road construction this reduction could only be introducedgradually. In 1970 the total values of schemes deferred (with expenditure spreadover several years) would amount to  140 million or 40 per cent. The trunk road programme would be cut back and urban road outlays would have to be curtailed; as this is where the worst congestion occurs and heaviest demands
are made the consequences would be serious both for traffic and in terms oflarge economic benefits deferred. The Government^ announced completion ofthe motorway programme in the early 1970s would fail to be achieved until1975. Owing to the long time leads curtailments could not easily be reversedexcept over a considerable period.Scotland8.  million1967 Survey pricesPercentageincrease 1967-6to 1970-71	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	Total	Per						annumNew roads    ......	36	42	46	47	31	maintenance......	22	23	23	23	5	1Total   .........	58	65	69	70	21	6Plus 5 per cent		2	3	4	28	3Minus 1\ per cent  ...	 	3	5	5	12	49. The main object of the present Scottish programme is 289 miles of dualcarriageway by 1972 on the main industrial routes, and the most essential urbanimprovements. The 5 per cent increase would go towards partial recovery ofdelayed schemes and to better progress on urban redevelopment. The 1\ percent decrease would delay the completion of the present trunk route programme by at least two years.Wales10.  million1967 Survey prices1967-68    1968-69    1969-70   1970-71Percentageincrease 1967-68to 1970-71Total     PerTotal   ......Plus 5 per centMinus 1\ per cent28291131213623293618annum811511. The consequences of changes up or down are similar to those in Scotland.An increase would only allow partial recovery of previously delayed schemes: adecrease would delay half the present programme by nearly a year.Infrastructure grants12. The Transport White Paper foreshadowed proposals for assistance towards comprehensive local transport development plans in major conurbationsand other local projects, e.g., tubes in London, the Mersey railway. TheChancellor reserved his position on any increase in total expenditure on transport: the total for infrastructure grants alone could reach  29 million a yearby 1970-71 and there are further proposals for road safety, bus subsidies and grants and transport research (see Annex B, Item IV (5) on &quot; Transport, other thanroads&quot;) which could add a further  23 million a year by 1970-71. None ofthese increases is provided for in the basic programme.ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 1967 survey and INCREASED AND REDUCED LEVELSA.I.

II.   HOUSING: CIVIL REVIEW (SUMMARY)1 Housing expenditure in Great Britain is estimated on existing policies to rise from  1,018 million in 1967-68 to  1,098 million in 1968-69 and 1149 million in 1970-71. These totals provide for the authorised number ofpublic authority houses, for improved space and heating standards in Englandand Wales, for the new housing subsidies and for the mortgage option scheme. *2. The United Kingdom housing target is 500,000, of which the public sector should provide about half. The authorised programme is for public startsto rise from 230,500 in 1967 to 242,000 in 1970: completions rise from 193,000to 237,000.3. (a) About 260,000 houses a year (public and private) are needed in theperiod up to 1970 for new households, for losses from stock (e.g., road widening)and for the maximum slum clearance that can be achieved. Any new housesabove this number will go towards meeting shortages, providing a margin formobility and for replacing old houses not worth improving. By 1970 no appreciable impact will have been made on the replacement of near slum andobsolescent housing widely distributed in all the main built-up areas.(b) The Official Committee on Housing in their Interim Report on thehousing programme drew attention to the assessment of housing needs madein 1965 when it was estimated that there were 1 million slums and2 million obsolescent houses not worth improving; and that 700,000houses were needed to overcome shortages and to provide an adequate marginfor mobility. The Committee also referred to the change in emphasis in housingneed. In 1951 there were some li million more families than houses; by the endof 1966 there were about 400,000 more dwellings than potential households; andthis number would rise to some 1-2 million in 1970 if housebuilding increasedto a rate of 500,000. The increase in the margin of houses over households will however only be obtained because slum clearance has not risen as fast as wouldbe desirable. This national margin will conceal major local shortages which will still remain in London and Clydeside; part of the margin will be accountedfor by holiday and second homes which are in effect withdrawn from the housingstock; while a further part will consist of the considerable number of housesnecessarily empty during changes of occupancy or while under repair orconversion. A margin of vacancies is a normal characteristic of the housingmarket and is necessary to ensure its smooth working and to permit mobility oflabour. The Committee will shortly submit a further report taking account, inter alia, of a recent national survey of house condition. This survey shows a largebacklog of disrepair and many more unfit houses than the provisional estimates in the interim report. This will have implications for improvement, repair andclearance policies.England and Wales4.  The cost of existing policies, and the Basic total for 1970-71, are:  million1967 Survey prices1967-68 1968-69 1969-70 1970-71Investment       .........          672               716               732 724Subsidies and improvements ...          152                185               203 228Mortgage lending, etc. (net) ...            17                  4                -5 -15Total existing policies    ... 841 905 930 937Basic total......... 8925. The excess of  45 million over the Basic total is because virtually all local authorities have already adopted the improved, Parker Morris, space andheating standards. It is assumed that no saving could be made on these standards.Nor could expenditure on subsidies be significantly reduced unless the new rates were cut within a few months of the enactment of the Housing Subsidies Bill.
6. The major choice available is therefore to adjust the number of houses to save the  45 million needed to keep within the Basic total in 1970-71, housingapprovals would have to be held steady at slightly below the current level. Adecrease of 1\ per cent, to save  112 million, would mean reducing approvals toabout 20,000 a year below the current level. An increase of 5 per cent on Basicwould be sufficient to offset the cost of improved standards without changing the authorised programme, under which approvals would rise by 1969 by about10,000 a year above the current level.7. The Housing Departments maintain that - 1\ per cent/ -\- 5 per centshould be applied to the cost of existing policies (including the cost of improvedstandards). On this basis, an increase of 5 per cent would add a further  47 million to expenditure in 1970-71, and allow approvals to rise to 21,500 above the current level by 1969, declining slightly thereafter.8. The effect in 1968-69 of a 5 per cent increase over existing policies wouldbe to add  15 million. Conversely, keeping expenditure to the Basic total couldsave  8 million in 1968-69. The reduction to Basic - 1\ per cent could save 30 million in 1968-69 if announced by mid-1967: if announced at end-1967,this saving would be halved.9. The effect of the different England and Wales programmes on UnitedKingdom public sector totals in 1970 would be:Starts CompletionsBasic -1\ per cent       .........        212,500 212,500Basic         ...............        229,000 229,000Basic ^ 5 per cent    existing policies) ...        242,000 237,000Existing policies +S per cent   ......        251,000 249,00010. It is difficult to assess the effects on the satisfaction of housing needs.Thus, it is not clear whether slum clearance will rise to 95,000 a year if localauthority approvals are restricted. But if expenditure were reduced to Basic- 1\ per cent, it is most unlikely that the private sector would make up the shortfall and enable the 500,000 target to be met in 1970.11. Some mitigation of the reduction in numbers might be obtained bydecisions to disallow for housing subsidy the expenditure on Parker Morrisstandards for equipment and fittings; and to insist, wherever possible, onhardstandings in preference to garages. At best the saving could hardly exceed 15 million in 1970-71.12. Up to  45 million might also be saved in 1970-71 by reducing localauthority mortgage lending in that year from  130 million (as in 1967-68) to 85 million. This would involve a very severe system of rationing home loansbetween individual authorities; and its effect on physical resources released wouldbe less than that of cutting the housing programme. If the reduction were madeprogressively in 1969-70 and 1970-71, it might be made good by increased lendingfrom other agencies. But no savings could be secured in 1968-69 without thegreatest difficulty.Scotland13.

The programme is designed to produce about 38,000 public authorityhouses in 1970 towards a Scottish target of 50,000. A 1\ per cent decrease in expenditure (-  16 million) could be obtained by keeping approvals steady at the
level of about 35,000 which it is hoped to achieve in 1967. The private sectorcould not be expected to make good the shortfall. An increase of 5 per cent( lO-J- million) would allow for a small increase in housing approvals and for some additional expenditure on improvements, on &quot; patching &quot; slums, and on localauthority mortgage lending. Either way the effects on expenditure in 1968-69would be very small.ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 1967 survey and INCREASED AND REDUCED LEVELSA.II.

EDUCATION: CIVIL REVIEW (SUMMARY)The forecast increase between 1967-68 and 1970-71 in expenditure on education in Great Britain is about 15-6 per cent in three years or 5 per cent per annum; and on local libraries, etc., 30-2 per cent or 9-2 per cent per annum.For this review expenditure on these two items has been considered together.5&quot;2.  The main policies for which the expenditure figures allow are:(a) Provision in schools for the increasing numbers of children between the compulsory ages of 5 and 15 (16 from the raising of the leaving age in1970-71) and of those staying on voluntarily the school population(Great Britain) is estimated to rise from 8-2 million in 1967 to-7 million in 1972 (without raising the school leaving age the rise would still be large, i.e., to 9-3 million in 1972); .,(b) Increase in the numbers of teachers in schools not only to cope with (a)above, but also to make progress towards the elimination in Englandand Wales of classes over 40 in primary schools and over 30 in secondary schools as soon as possible, with corresponding progress inScotland announced target of 122,000 places (Great Britain) incolleges of education in 1973-74;(c) Provision of courses of higher education  (universities, colleges  ofeducation or advanced education), in accordance with the Robbinsrecommendation, for all those who are qualified by ability andattainment to pursue them and who wish to do so announced objective218,000 places in universities, 392,000 in all full-time higher education in 1973-74.3. Education expenditure in the coming years is dominated by the increased demand caused by the rising number of children ij\ million aged 5-14 in 1955,7vf, million in 1966, 8J million in 1970 and % million in 1975) and by improvementin quality and standards, e.g., the greater number in higher education and stayingon voluntarily at school as well as raising the school-leaving age.
4.

The raising of the school leaving age is a specialelement in this period which offers scope for savings through postponement. Thereis some possibility of reducing expenditure through the deterrent effect of highercharges, e.g., for school meals. But apart from these there is no real prospect ofsignificant savings without policy changes related to the numbers of teachers to be trained and employed and/or the intake of students at the various levels above the compulsory age.6. A 5 per cent increase above the 1970-71 base-line would allow an extra 128 million of expenditure. This would permit a quickening of the pace of advance over a broad front, with particular emphasis on (a) the development of primary education as&apos; recommended in the Plowden Report ( 49 million);\b) current improvements on secondary schools, especially in educational priorityareas ( 11 million); and (c) improvements to secondary school buildings( 23 million). There would also be scope for additions to other capital programmes( 14 million), including provision for extra medical school places ( 2 million), theexpansion of in-service training for teachers ( 8 million) and provision for suchitems as the first stage of the integration of the public schools ( 6 million) and the open University ( 3 million).7. A 7\ per cent decrease below the base-line in 1970-71 would mean a reduction of  164 million. Major contributions to this total could be made by(a) postponing the raising of the school leaving age for four years in England andWales and for two years in Scotland ( 46 million); (b) making an economic charge for school meals ( 46 million plus extra income of.j 12 million) and (c) withdrawingschool milk ( 16 million). Other significant reductions could be found in current and capital expenditure on further education ( 13 million) and universities( 9 million), in student support ( 15 million) and in expenditure on libraries andmuseums ( 13 million).ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 1967 survey and INCREASED AND REDUCED LEVELSA.III.

IV.   HEALTH: CIVIL REVIEW (SUMMARY)1.  In the health and welfare field present policies* envisage:(a) Capital expenditure on hospital building ( 1,000 million over 10 years upto 1975) sufficient as to one-fifth to keep pace with the forecast growth of population, and as to four-fifths to replace or improve existinghospitals.(b) Annual allocations to hospital running costs increasing at the rate of2J per cent per annum (rising to 3% per cent in 1970-71), two-thirds ofwhich will be required to match the revenue consequences of completedbuilding schemes and the rest to permit other developments of theservice and advances in clinical techniques.(c) The development of local health and welfare services within the framework of the published 10-year forward plans of local authorities. Theseimply an expansion in these services of 58 per cent over a 10-year period, and currently at the rate of about 7 per cent over the next three years.(d) Development of personal medical services as qualified manpower becomes available; as more effective deployment of manpower becomes possible;and as better drugs come into use.2. Health and welfare expenditure in 1967-68 totals  1,619 million. Half ofthis ( 811 million) is required for the running costs of the hospital service, and afurther quarter ( 378 million) for the personal medical services (GPs, dentists,opticians, drugs) provided by the executive councils. About 12 per cent( 192 million) is current expenditure by local authorities on the local health and welfare services. On capital account the main items are NHS hospitals( 104 million) and residential homes and health centres and clinics provided bylocal authorities ( 30 million).3. A very large proportion (about 70 per cent) of the current expenditure onhospitals and on the local authority services is on staff. The total payroll of these services is estimated at 770,000 in 1967-68 and on present forecasts this is expectedto rise to 860,000 in 1970-71.4. The forecast growth of expenditure up to 1970-71 for England, Wales and scotland is as follows (an increase of 124- per cent in 3 years or about 4 per centannually):  million1967 Survey pricesHospitalsCapital      .........Current      .........Executive CouncilsGPs......      ......Drugs        .........Dentists (net)       ......Opticians (net)     ......Local Health and WelfareCapital      .........Current     .........Welfare Foods......Central Government Services(including research andtraining)Other (including imputed rents)Total1967-68	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71104-3	114-7	124-5	134-4810-8	832-6	858-1	888-5129 0	131-3	134-5	138-3168-5	174-2	179-9	185-566-7	67-7	68-9	70-413-6	13-7	14-1	14-429-9	36-3	38-4	40-6192-1	205-6	220-0	235-645-9	45-9	46-6	46-518-4	20-5	21-1	21-539-6	400	40-8	41-91,618-8	1,682-5	1,746-9	1,817-6
5. The most important determinant of the growth of expenditure on health and welfare is the rate of capital expenditure on hospitals. In the four years 1967-68to 1970-71 some  478 million is forecast to be spent on hospital capital development, yielding the equivalent of about 40,000 hospital beds (the presentstock is 535,000). Only one-fifth of these would be additional; the rest would replace obsolete accommodation. This will about keep pace with the ageing ofthe present stock. The problem of obsolescence is probably greater here than inthe case of any other major social service programme, and substantially higher rates of expenditure would be required to make real inroads into it.6. Current expenditure on hospitals is also closely related to the size of thecapital programme: more than half the present rate of growth is required to finance the additional costs arising from capital works already in hand. Theexecutive council services are open to all comers, and demand is not directlycontrolled (although charges may have a deterrent effect). The local authoritycurrent expenditure is also not directly controlled from the centre, and can onlybe indirectly influenced by the amount allowed for Rate Support Grant. The localauthority capital programmes (unlike the hospitals) consist of projects which arequick to build, and the programme can therefore be modified more readily, butexpenditure here can provide accommodation for some who would otherwise haveto be accommodated more expensively in hospitals.7. The fact that the numbers of the elderly and the very young are risingduring this period more rapidly than the population as a whole will have a directbearing on the load falling on the hospitals and the local authority services. It isalso bound to influence the pattern of their development.8. The scope for really substantial changes in 1970-71 is therefore limited toaltering the pace of hospital capital development, imposing charges, or abandoning(or levying a full economic charge for) whole services.9. A 7\ per cent reduction would mean a reduction of  136 million. Majorcontributions to this could be made by (a) reductions in the hospital service( 30 million capital:  11 million current); (b) limitation of the welfare milk service to large families only ( 39 million); (c) abandonment of the general dental service( 42 million) or the ophthalmic service ( 11 million); (d) a prescription charge or aGP consultation charge (yielding a saving of perhaps  17 million in terms of grosspublic expenditure); (e) local authority services ( 6 million capital:  6 millioncurrent).10. A 5 per cent increase would allow an extra  90 million. This would allow a quickening of the pace of advance on a broad front, with particularemphasis on (a) hospitals (capital  31 million: current  23 million including 7 million for arrears of maintenance); (b) local authority services ( 9 millioncapital:  5 million current); (c) research and development, the use of automationand computers, and more training ( 10 million). A start could also be made in theprovision of invalid cars to NHS patients, head-worn hearing aids, and an improved range of spectacle frames.ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 1967 survey and INCREASED AND REDUCED LEVELSA.IV.

V.  SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS: CIVIL REVIEW (SUMMARY)The basic programme for social security benefits is calculated by reference tothe cost of providing for periodic increases in benefits (other than family allowances) in line with the forecast movement in real earnings, subject to ministerial decisions varying this from time to time, and with allowance made for changes in the number of prospective beneficiaries. Expenditure is effectivelydetermined by the range of benefits, their rates and the numbers of peoplequalifying for them.*2. Between 1967-68 and 1970-71 the number of retirement pensioners isexpected to rise from 6-6 million to 7 million (about 6 per cent) and of childrenqualifying for family allowances from 6 - 7 million to 7 - 2 million (about 1\ per cent).On the other hand the number of unemployed is assumed to fall by 100,000 (about17 per cent).3. Allowing for the changing numbers and the assumed increases in the real value of the benefits, total expenditure on social security benefits is forecast to riseby  275 million or 9-5 per cent (3-1 per cent per annum) between 1967-68 and1970-71. The following table shows the main constituents of the programme:  million1967 Survey prices	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71National insurance   ......	2,156	2,236	2,315	2,402War pensions ...	125	125	124	123Non-contributory benefits  ...	357	362	366	373Family allowances   ......	154	158	162	166Administration        ......	112	110	111	115	2,904	2,991	3,078	3,1794. It is necessary to note that changes in the basic assumptions this yearcompared with last mean that expenditure in 1970-71 as now forecast is 111 million below last year&apos;s forecast revalued to 1967 Survey prices. In addition,the Cabinefs decision that the 1967 uprating should be 10s. (instead of being in line with real earnings less Is.) means a further saving of  13 million in 1970-71,making a total reduction of  124 million. The differences are summarised below:  millionSlower growth of earnings (actual and assumed) ...       -139Biennial (instead of annual) upratings   ......       - 37More beneficiaries (especially unemployed) ... -I- 60Administration        .........      ......       4-   5Net change...............       -IllReduction in 1967 uprating        .........       - 13Total        ...............       -1245. 5 per cent of estimated expenditure in 1970-71 (i.e.,  3,192 million beforethe Cabinefs decision on the 1967 uprating) would be about  160 million. A first charge on this would be for family endowment (no estimate made at this stage).Another possible development looks forward to the introduction of the earnings-related pension scheme: in 1969, after making good the cut below the rise in earnings, national insurance benefits (but not non-contributory benefits) would befurther increased by 5s. on the standard rate for a single person. This would reducethe potential disparity between existing pensions and those which will eventuallybecome payable under the new scheme (cost  133 million). Other possibilities are(a) lowering the qualifying age for widow&apos;s pension ( 20 million), (b) constantattendance allowance for the chronic sick ( 10 million), (c) allowance to providefor1 the minor adjustments to the scheme which are unavoidable from time to time( 15 million), (d) improvements in pension increments ( 5 million in 1970-71 butconsiderably more in the long term).
6. 1\ per cent of estimated expenditure in 1970-71 would be about 240 million. Short of withdrawing existing benefits or reducing their coveragethe only opportunity for making really significant savings comes at the time of anuprating. The Cabinefs decision to hold down the 1967 uprating to 10s. will giverise to savings of  13 million in 1970-71. If the next uprating were two years later in October 1969, and this were in line with increases in prices rather than earnings&apos;the further saving would be  140 million. (To save the balance of  227 million inthis way would mean an uprating well below the increase justified by prices.)7. A saving between nil and  140 million could be achieved (i) by fixing the size of the uprating somewhere within the range from price-relation only to fullearnings-relation and/or (ii) by applying a differential increase within that rangeto national insurance (contributory) benefits and to non-contributory benefits. any decision to make a differential increase as at (ii) would raise the important questionwhether to favour non-contributory benefits (thus giving more to the poorest, atthe cost of bringing more people on to supplementary benefits, financed entirelyout of general taxation) or to favour contributory benefits (on the grounds that non-contributory benefits had already reached, or were reaching, an adequate levelin real terms and need not rise as fast as contributory benefits).8. Other possibilities for saving include (a) abolition of the  22 maternitygrant ( 26 million); (b) abolition of the death grant, at present  25 ( 10 million);(c) amending the &quot; waiting days &quot; rules for receipt of sickness and unemploymentbenefit from 3 waiting days (payable if sickness or unemployment lasts at least12 days) for flat-rate benefit and 12 absolute (non-repayable) waiting days forgraduated benefit to either 6 absolute waiting days for both flat-rate and graduatedbenefit ( 25 million) or 3 absolute waiting days for flat-rate benefit while retaining12 absolute waiting days for graduated benefit ( 15 million); (cl) replacement ofindustrial injury benefit, payable for up to 6 months, by sickness benefit whichis at a lower rate ( 13 million).ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 1967 survey and INCREASED AND REDUCED LEVELSA.V.

Civil defence is still underconsideration by the Home Defence Review Committee.(b) Reduced levelFurther significant reductions in the local authority field would have veryserious consequences, e.g., to stop bounty payments to the Civil Defence Corps; orto omit protected accommodation in new police and fire service buildings, whichwould involve substantial additional expenditure if provided at a later date. Itwould be necessary therefore to look for virtually the whole of any saving withinthe central government field. First, some reduction would have to be made inthe provision for the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve III (T &amp; have III).If that force were disbanded altogether, the saving would be  2-6 million; short of complete disbandment, savings would have to be achieved by cutting out annualcamps ( 0-5 million) or by reducing the number of units. The required balanceof the reduction would then range from  1-3 million to  3-4 million, depending on the reduction made on the T &amp; have III provision. To find this balance, thefollowing items would have to be examined:	Possible saving	  millionRun down of food stockpile-up to     ......	1-5Deferment of control buildings up to  ......	0-5Deferment of additional line communications for	controls up to    ...............	0-4Closing down of central CD training (Staff College	and Schools) up to      ............	0-4Termination of police war preparations up to ...	-    0-3Deferment of purchasing for the medical stockpile 	up to        .........     ...     ......	0-2Deferment of emergency oil installations up to	0-2Deferment of provision of equipment and other	miscellaneous provisions up to.........	0-7The adoption of the measures referred to would involve the reversal of decisions taken by Ministers on the recommendation of the Home Defence review committee and for the most part announced publicly.(c) Increased levelPossible candidates in the field of local authority expenditure might be:(a) Civil Defence Corps training premises.(b) Additional provision of protected control accommodation in new policebuildings.(c) Additional provision of protected control accommodation in new fire&apos;        service buildings.id) Intensifying preparation of emergency feeding plans.* Such references in this Annex are to Sections of Part Three of the Committee&apos;s &quot; 1967 Reporton Public Expenditure to 1971-72: Continuation of Existing Policies&quot;.
But for central government expenditure in 1970-71 a saving of at least 0-8 million must be found. The possible reductions listed above would still have to be examined.ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 1967 survey and INCREASED AND REDUCED levels b..I.

That figure was fixed in 1965. Being in cash terms it means adeclining real value, and a declining proportion of national income so that werisk falling short of our UNCTAD commitment to at least 1 per cent of national income. The balance of payments cost of the gross programme may be about onethird. Net of repayments and interest, our contribution to the needs of developing countries is only about  150 million a year. The policy of helping to raise living standards in developing countries for which the Ministry was established cannot be sustained within this framework and in the view of the Minister existing policy would require a progressive increase to  250 million at current prices in 1970-71.(b) Reduced level(i) A programme of  208 million for 1970-71 would, even on a constant pricebasis, imply no increase on the reduced provision for 1967-68 following the Julymeasures. On a cash basis it would represent a serious absolute decline in our contribution to world development. In the opinion of the ODM it would representless than our fair share of this, and would be inadequate in relation to developmentneeds and to our own political and economic interests in raising the standardof the developing countries.(ii) We should not be able to continue our announced policy of expanding as our resources permit the proportion of our programme devoted to multilateralaid, unless we were prepared to make further cuts in the bilateral programmes.The allocation of such a programme which the ODM have put forward involves&apos; holding down our provision for the replenishment of IDA to  11-5 million annuallyin the first two years and  17-5 million in 1970-71, though this would be smaller* The aid programme is at present on a cash basis. The ODM is proposing that it should be on a constant price basis.  This will be for consideration as part of the Survey.
than our proportionate share of the level of replenishment which is likely to beagreed internationally.(hi) Contributions to the United Nations Development Programme would alsobe held down to the current level despite strong international and domesticpressures in the direction of increase.(iv) The ODM&apos;s planning framework for a programme of  208 million impliesthe limitation of aid to India in 1970-71 to  45 million gross, about the same as in1966-67. (Interest and amortisation payments from India in that year would beabout half this amount.) Pakistan would receive some  8 - 3 million. The provisionfor the rest of the developing Commonwealth in a  208 million programme wouldbe such that very little aid could be provided for Ceylon, Malaysia or singapore and quite small amounts for Ghana and Nigeria. Aid to Kenya would be substantially less than at present, and our contribution to development there, as distinct from land settlement, would be minimal. Apart from Guyana theindependent countries of the Caribbean v/ould get no capital aid. If relations arerestored and aid has to be provided for Tanzania the provision for other commonwealth countries would be correspondingly reduced.(v) In a  208 million programme aid to foreign countries would be in the viewof ODM have to be reduced to a level well below what we expect to provide in 1967-68, allowing no more than bare bones provision for one or two countries where we have firm obligations with very small amounts for a few others.(c) Increased level(i) A programme of  236 million in cash terms even now represents a marginaldecline in real value compared with the value of the base figure of  225 million when that was originally fixed. If the programme were  236 million in 1970-71, risingprogressively from a level of  225 million in 1968-69, the ODM&apos;s first objectivewould be to provide substantially more for the IDA. This would not only benefit the developing countries but should benefit the United Kingdom through the securing of IDA financed exports. More could be provided for the independent commonwealth countries, but not enough, in the ODM&apos;s judgment, to meet the realneeds of countries like Ghana and Ceylon and various other commonwealth countries. The programme for foreign countries, which has been severely cut backin recent years, could be advanced to a higher level than in recent years, though not to an extent which would meet the views of the Foreign Office.(ii) The view of the Minister of Overseas Development is that even a programme of  236 million in 1970-71 would fall seriously short of what is needed and represents a decline in the real value of our aid. The Minister recommends a programme of  250 million at constant prices in 1970-71 with a suitableprogression in the two preceding years as representing the smallest reasonableprovision to enable us to meet our obligations and advance our own interestsboth in general and specific terms. &apos;*(d) General(i) The forecasts provide nothing for an international agreement on supplementary Financial Measures to assist developing countries which experienceunexpected shortfalls in their export earnings. If such a scheme should be agreed,we, as one of the two original sponsors, would find it difficult to refuse to contribute.Nor is there any provision for other possible major developments such as british membership of the European Economic Community.(ii) The analysis above is based on ODM views. It has been discussed withthe Commonwealth Office and the Foreign Office. The figures reflect the need(generally agreed) to treat the reasonable requirements of the remaining colonies as a first call on our aid resources, and to maintain as far as possible the importantprogramme of technical assistance.(iii) The Commonwealth Office consider that British political and economic interests demand that bilateral programmes for independent commonwealth countries should be maintained and if possible increased.(iv) The Foreign Office consider that the provision made for foreign countries,even in the  236 million programme ( 25 million), is inadequate and would damage British interests.

The balance of the expenditure consists mainly of support costs, i.e., administrative expenses, communications and transport.(b) Reduced levelA cut of  3-5 million in 1970-71 could be achieved by reducing commitmentsas follows:Overseas Establishments, etc.(i) We should have to withdraw representation completely fromapproximately 23 countries including a number in the important tradepromotion area of Latin America, in the Far East and in the Commonwealth.Another 30 individual posts in other countries would also have to be closed.The difficulties in doing so, and the diplomatic and commercial repercussionslikely, would be very great. Such closures would represent approximately20 per cent of the total of Diplomatic Service Missions overseas, or in manpower terms a 10 per cent overall cut in our overseas establishments with consequent increases in expenditure on pensions and for homeward travel for united Kingdom staff no longer required. In addition an arbitrary cut of10 per cent in spending on local staff at other posts would be necessary.Together with the adoption of a completely static policy in relation to training and duty travel, etc., these measures would reduce costs by about  3-15 million.Home Establishments(ii) The complete amalgamation of the Foreign Office and commonwealth office would save about  0-1 million and possible reductions in GCHQexpenditure a total of  0-25 million in 1970-71.(c) Increased levelAdditional expenditure of  2 - 6 million could be used as follows:&apos; (i) The deployment of staff overseas on the basis of oustanding claims fromposts, chiefly for trade promotion requirements, and the restoration ofcuts (including those made in Information Services) in recent economyexercises.(ii) Increase of staff margin from 1\ per cent to 10 per cent as recommended in the Plowden Report.ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 1967 survey and INCREASED AND REDUCED LEVELS

It is also possible that specific grants will also be desirable in order to assist the processof elimination of surplus track capacity by the Board. For the rest, it is proposedthat the Board will be given realistic financial targets aimed at achieving viabilityfor the commercial part of their undertaking within the shortest practicable time.(iii) The Steering Group have not yet reported on the probable savings tobe gained by the adoption of the policies referred to above and it is, therefore,not possible as yet to inform Ministers of the actual range of choice which willlie before them. At this stage all that can be said is that the area of choice shouldbe considerable-certainly larger than the bracket of 4- 5 per cent and - 1\ percent which is being applied to other programmes. The adoption of the new policies will also facilitate choice in that the social element in government expenditure on assistance to the railways, i.e., for loss-making passenger services,will be clearly separated from the rest and can stand alongside other Exchequersocial expenditure, while any residual subsidy for the commercial part of the system can be considered in relation to the progress being made by the Railways board in eliminating surplus capacity and generally adjusting their undertaking to modernday needs, e.g., by any further slimming of the 11,000 route mile system implied by the publication of the Network Map earlier this year, by withdrawal of loss-making freight services or facilities, by singling finds or on the other hand byvigorous promotion of profitable services.(2) Airports  million1967 Survey prices1968-69 1969-70 1970-71 1971-721966 Survey        ......        25-3           25-8           23-7 -Reduced level      ...      ...        24-4 24-5 22 0Increased level     ...      ...        25-9 26-7 25-01967 Survey        ...      ...        24-9           25-1           27-4 23-8(a) Continuation of existing policiesThis expenditure covers aerodromes, air traffic control services and services overseas. The increase between 1966 and 1967 Surveys is largely accounted forby the revised costing of the Linesman /Mediator project for a combined civil/military air traffic control system, revision of the programme of local authorityinvestment, increased costs and rephasing of programmes for aerodromes and higher staff costs to deal with a steadily increasing flow of air traffic. Thusboth the reduced and the increased levels of expenditure in 1970-71 are belowthe 1967 PESC forecasts. (See also Section lid.)
(b) Reduced level(i) AerodromesThe reduced programme would involve deferring the contruction ofthe new runway and new terminal building at Edinburgh (turn house) byat least one year, and major schemes at some local authority aerodromes(Liverpool, Birmingham, Southend, Plymouth and Blackpool) would haveto be deferred or delayed. At this stage the effect on air transport in the regions concerned during the 1970s is not easy to assess, but it mightnot be serious if the expenditure were deferred for only a year.(ii) Air traffic control and air safetyA material saving in current expenditure could be made only by curtailingto a significant degree the operational air traffic control and other services provided for the safe and regular use of civil air traffic in the United Kingdom,which would be hard to achieve without conflicting with our obligations under the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and EurocontrolConventions. Substantial cuts in capital expenditure would also result in serious curtailment in the development of an integrated civil/military air traffic control system. Other expenditure on air safety is largely bound up with certification and inspection and could not readily be cut back.(iii) Services overseasThis expenditure includes contributions to the cost of Support schemes under ICAO and the cost of services provided by Colonial and otherGovernments and for the most part are agreements which would have tobe renegotiated in the light of Government policy overseas before expenditure   could be reduced.ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 1967 survey and INCREASED AND REDUCED levels b..IV (2).

saving of the order of  60 million which may result in the Survey period, following the decision by Ministers in June 1967 to accelerate payments in 1967-68.(b) Increased and Reduced levels(i) Expenditure on investment grants could be significantly increased ordecreased by policy decisions on the rate of grant paid, on the timetable for payinggrant, and by making alterations in the boundaries of the Development Areas,which would affect the amount of grant paid at the higher Development Area rate.(ii) To continue payment of grants at the level to which they have been temporarily increased for expenditure incurred in 1967 and 1968 from 20 to 25 percent nationally and from 40 to 45 per cent in Development Areas would involveincreased expenditure of roughly  25 million in 1969-70 and up to  55 million in subsequent years, not allowing for any change in the timetable for paying grant.(iii) A speeding-up or slowing-down of the timetable for paying grant wouldalso affect the timing though not the absolute amount of expenditure involved.The figures above assume that a saving of  60 million is made in 1970-71 and1971-72 by only paying four quarters&apos; grant in each of those years, so that at theend of the period grant is being paid nine months after the expenditure in question was incurred. The recent decision to pay a further (i.e., a fifth) quarters grant in1967-68 raises, however, the immediate question whether five quarters&apos; grant shouldbe paid in 1968-69, as originally envisaged, or whether only four quarters&apos; grant should be paid, thus saving in 1968-69, rather than in later years, the additional 60 million due to fall in 1967-68, as a result of paying five quarters&apos; grant then.Since the Government is not committed to a timetable for paying investment grants,there is also the further possibility of paying only three quarters&apos; grant in 1968-69.This would reduce expenditure in that year, at the cost of offsetting increases later.(iv) The coverage of the Development Areas is also material. These at presentcomprise 20 per cent of employment in Great Britain. If this coverage were increased or decreased to 25 or 15 per cent, the total of investment grant payment would be varied by roughly 2 per cent, i.e., by up to  8-10 million a year.ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 1967 survey and INCREASED AND REDUCED levels b..V.

The extent to which there are options open to theGovernment, and the character of the options, is different in each of these threeareas, which are examined below.(ii) The Ministry of Technology^ expenditure may, however, be subject tofurther variations, not covered by these figures, in that no allowance has been madefor contingencies which might arise in the field of assistance to industry sponsored by the Department but which in their nature are not predictable in advance asregards amounts or timing. The Ministry of Technology suggest that, if a specificcontingency allowance were provided for these items, it might, at a guess, be put at  25 million a year. In the absence of special provision for such items, they would fall to be regarded as claims on the general provision for contingencies in public expenditure planning.

In that case the work would have to beundertaken more slowly, and some of the work planned for the future might haveto be abandoned altogether, either in the Government establishments or in the workdirectly for industry. The Department believes that a disproportionate loss to thenational economy would result.(2) Major projects and financial assistance to industry(i) The concept of options cannot usefully be applied to the programme ofassistance to the shipbuilding industry or the continuation of existing major AEAreactor projects, but a number of important aircraft projects now under discussionare not yet firm: while, in the case of space research and development, any additional ELDO programme would involve a new policy decision. The tablesbelow relate to the aircraft and space programmes only.(ii) A aircraft projects and assistance  million1967 Survey prices1968-69 1969-70 1970-71 1971-721966 Survey      .........        43-9             33-1             27-4 -1967 Survey:Projects already approved   ...        55-4 41-1             32-4 24-0Projects under discussion    ...        30-5 44-3             41-7 54 0Total 1967 Survey       ...        85-9 85-4 74-1 78-0The reduction of the figures for projects already approved would mean the cancellation of major items such as the Concord development programme, the firstaircraft for the BEA re-equipment or the RB 207 or 203 engines. A reduction in1970-71 of  20 million, or nearly half the total for projects under discussion, wouldresult from an arrangement to finance the Concord production programme bymeans of bank loans with Government guarantees. The &quot; projects underdiscussion&quot; include  3-5 million for the RB 207 in 1970-71 in addition to the 3-5 million included in the approved figures. Part of this extra provision may be needed when arrangements for launching the engine are finally settled, and inparticular if the proposed sharing arrangement with General Motors is notsuccessfully negotiated. The 1970-71 figures for the other.major items in this category, namely the Airbus ( 8 million) and the BEA second aircraft ( 3 - 2 million),are subject to change, but substantial expenditure on the second of these couldnot be avoided without a reversal of declared policy.(iii) Space (civil research and development)  million1967 Survey prices1968-69 1969-70 1970-71 1971-721966 Survey      .........       13-5 11-9 10-2             -1967 Survey      .........        12-5 10-4 7-3              4-7ELDO additional provision ...           1-5 4-4              6-9The additional provision shown above is on the assumption that ELDO will undertake an additional programme, beginning in 1969-70, and that, as a consequence, the Organisation^ total expenditure will continue at approximately the present level. This would, however, entail a fresh policy decision, and this additional expenditure has not therefore been included in the main table in thereport on Continuation of Existing Policies.(3) Share purchases and other financial transactionsThe concept of options cannot usefully be applied to the transactions at presentincluded in this group.

No provision has been made for expenditure likely to arise if the United Kingdom joined the eec, in particular participation in the European Social Fund, which might involvea net cost of about  2 million.ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 1967 survey and INCREASED AND REDUCED levels b..VII.

This would have lesseffect than might be expected at first sight, because the number of mobileprojects is limited, which in its turn would limit the response to a changein the area in which assistance was available. In general terms,however, to reduce the size of the Development Areas from their present level, which involves about 20 per cent of the insured population, tosay 15 per cent, would save  1 million or  2 million a year.(ii) Variations in the rate of building grant. The present rate is 25 per cent.Annual expenditure at this rate of grant is expected to rise from thepresent level of  20 million by about  2 million per year. Reducingthe rate of grant to 20 per cent would mean savings of about  5 million per year. Increasing the rate of grant to 35 per cent generally (a rate which now is only given in exceptional circumstances) would meanadditional expenditure of  8-10 million per annum above what itwould otherwise be at the existing 25 per cent rate,(hi) Altering the terms of Board of Trade Advisory Committee (BOTAC) loans.A saving could be made most simply by cutting the amount of loansgiven to large companies which could quite readily raise the balanceof the capital they require from the market. This would save perhaps 2 million per year. Relaxation of the terms on which loans weremade by BOTAC would lead to a substantial increase in expenditure,for example, if there was an interest-free period of two years on BOTACloans, a concession which would almost certainly lead to increasedlending.(iv) Building of advance factories could continue the increase of  2-3 million a year implied by the further programme approved in April or couldbe decreased. If no new programmes were introduced the last payment would fall in 1969-70.IX.   PROMOTION OF TRADE, ETC.

(b) Reduced levelTo reduce expenditure in 1970-71 by 1\ per cent below the 1966 forecastwould involve severe and widespread cuts in the activities covered by this programme the promotion of exports, the grant in aid to the British TravelAssociation and other bodies including those concerned with raising industrial productivity.(c) Increased levelTo limit expenditure to 5 per cent above the 1966 basic programme wouldrequire some curtailment of spending on these items and would rule out any newsignificant export services or measures to improve productivity.(d) UNCLEA scheme is under consideration for the establishment of a major home-basedaluminium smelting industry (UNCLE). In the form originally proposed thiswould involve the construction of a privately-owned nuclear power station tosupply the needs of an aluminium smelter owned by Rio Tinto Zinc and the sea&apos;suranium diffusion plant at Capenhurst. The total cost of the components (onthe basis of a 240,000 ton per annum smelter and a corresponding size of power station) would be very roughly  90 million for the smelter,  10 million for theextension to the sea diffusion plant and about  180 million for the power station(not all of which would however be required for the purpose of the joint company).The cost falling upon public expenditure would depend on which of the various possible methods of financing is adopted; but it could be of the order of  15 million per annum from 1968-69 to 1971-72 and beyond.ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 1967 survey and INCREASED AND REDUCED levels b..IX.

It would be a serious matter to upset this agreement now.The agreement reached was for increases in real terms of 11 per cent in1967-68, 10 per cent in 1968-69 and 9 per cent in 1969-70. These rates are lessthan the actual rates of growth achieved in previous years which averaged around12^ per cent. They are less than the CSP at first deemed necessary for adequatescientific growth.* The forecast covers expenditure by the Science, Medical, Agricultural and Natural EnvironmentResearch Councils, the British Museum (Natural History) and grants and services for scientificpurposes.
No figures have been agreed for 1970-71 and 1971-72. But the figuresprovisionally given for these years in the 1967 Survey show substantial reductionscompared with what would have resulted from the CSP&apos;s initial view and represent a continuing decline in the percentage rate of growth.(b) Reduced levelWithout seeking the advice of the Council for Scientific Policy and the research Councils it is not possible to say at all precisely where reductions wouldbe made if these were called for. Any reductions would however have a disproportionate effect on new projects because of the need to meet existing commitments. Moreover, even on the present Survey figures there are already a number of projects which will have to be dropped or postponed although the council&apos;s regard them as highly desirable if Britain is to remain in the forefrontof scientific research. The Department of Education and Science take the viewthat if there were any further cuts in 1968-69 and 1969-70 on the allocations now agreed and widely known to be agreed there would be a serious loss ofconfidence on the part of the scientists and a fresh stimulus would be given to thebrain drain.(c) Increased level(i) The increased level of expenditure would allow of some, perhaps most, of theretrenchment already mentioned to be avoided. The priorities for the allocation of additional money would call for the advice of the CSP and they have not been consulted.(ii) These higher figures do not, however, make any provision for the proposedCERN 300 percent proton synchrotron, a European research project which would,if carried out, provide the most advanced particle accelerator in the world. Ifthe United Kingdom were to participate in this, the Council for Scientific policy would expect an additional allocation of funds, over and above the figures so fardiscussed in this report. The possible amounts and timing are not firm, but the extra funds required might be  0-8 million in 1969-70,  2-7 million in 1970-71and  4 million in 1971-72 more if the accelerator were located in the UnitedKingdom, including additional expenditure under other PESC headings on theeconomic and social infrastructure of the site area. In later years the cost tothe United Kingdom might rise to  5-6 million a year, though there could be some compensating saving in the national programme of research in nuclear physics.ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 1967 survey and INCREASED AND REDUCED levels b..X.

consequences of adjusting the 1967 basic programme figures by -f- 5 per cent or- 7\ per cent. The basic figures are given on a conventional basis, related to theestimated cost in 1967-68 after allowing for the conclusions of the 1967 annual review.(ii) However, since present agricultural policy is geared to the selective expansion programme announced in the National Plan and assumes a 3  per cent average annual growth of net output, the agricultural departments have attempted toestimate in other terms the effect of a growth rate of only 2 per cent and a growth rate of 4  per cent. The figures are as follows:Estimated consequences of alternativerates of annual agricultural net output growth up to 19702 per cent    3\per cent   4\ per cent per annum     per annum    per annum 100  170  220million million million150,000       140,000       125,000Import saving in 1970      ...     ......Release of labour by 1970 .........Labour productivity compound growth rateper annum...............Required rate of gross fixed capital formationin 1970 (annual rate in 1964 was  170million)      ...............Required increase in working capital in 1970*5 per cent     (s\ per cent   7 per cent 175million 50million 190million 90million 220million 120/150million(iii) The above estimates of the implications of the various rates of growth of net output are speculative and neither they nor the financial incentives necessary to achieve them can be precisely predicted or controlled. It is fair to say however that some saving in Exchequer costs would be probable if the rate of growth were reduced to 2 per cent, and some increase would probably be required if it were increased to    per cent.XII.

It wouldnot be desirable to put a ceiling on this expenditure, but small staff economiesmight be possible ( 0-1 million).(ii) A reduction in the new planting programme (cost about  4 million ayear) by up to a quarter (from 48,000 to 36,000-40,000 acres). This would necessitate dispensing with some 750 industrial employees out of a total plantinglabour force of about 4,000 mainly in areas of limited alternative employment( 0-7 million).(iii) A large cut in the forest road programme (whereby timber is extracted).This would have a serious effect on extraction; especially if made for more thanone year, and cause substantial redundancy of road construction staff which itwould be difficult to make good ( 0 - 4 million). ,(c) Increased levelIncrease of 5,000-6,000 acres in planting programme, largely in Scotland( 0-5 million).Increasing amenity and recreation facilities and some forest housingimprovements ( 0-3 million).ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 1967 survey and INCREASED AND REDUCED levels b..XHL   Forestry Commission  million1967 Survey prices economic categoryCurrent expenditure on goods and services.........; Subsidies        .........Expenditure on fixed assets ...Increase in value of stocksTotal    ...     ......1968-69		1969-	-70		1970-714-	; -	+	. -		.&apos;- -440-1	-0-1	40-1	-0	1	40-1     -0-140-1	-0-1	4-0-1	-0	1	4-0-1     -0-1 	-0-6	40-1	-0	5	4-0-3     -0-340-5	-0-5	4,0-2	-0	8	-0-2     -1-240-7	-1-3	4-0-5	-1	5	4-0-3     -1-7ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 1967 survey and INCREASED AND REDUCED levels b..XII.

Other items in &quot; Other environmental services &quot; in Section 18 of the Existing Policies Report are excluded (such as land drainage, royal parks and ancient monuments) expenditure on which is of theorder of  17 million per annum.(1) Capital expenditure  million1967 Survey prices1968-69 1969-70 1970-71 1971-721966 Survey        ......       359-0 366-7 373-7 -Reduced level      ......       343-9 349-7 347-8Increased level     ......       364-7 379-3 392-11967 Survey        ......       362-3 376-8 384-5 392-3(a) Continuation of existing policyFollowing the 1966 Survey, capital expenditure in 1967-68 was cut by  41-4 million. These savings are being effected on parks and baths ( 15 million), planning and miscellaneous services ( 13 million), and water and sewerage ( 8 million). The1967 Survey forecasts reflect these cuts for 1967-^68; for subsequent years it is assumed that some restriction on the level of expenditure will continue throughoutthe period to 1971-72. The increase shown for 1970-71 is mainly attributable to a radical reappraisal of essential expenditure on water and sewerage in Wales.(See Section 18.)(b) Reduced level(i) A reduced level of expenditure in England in 1970-71 could be achieved bythe following savings:  millionSewerage............... 1-1Parks and baths............... 4-0Planning..................        10 miscellaneous    ............... 6-0Total...............        21 -1The saving of  4 million on Parks and Baths would mean restricting this category of expenditure to its 1964-65 level; it would have implications forGovernment policies on the countryside and would be incompatible with a policyof more active promotion of sport than in the past.&apos; The saving of  10 million on Planning would involve restrictions on town centre and other redevelopment,including some restrictions in development areas where one-third of this expendituretakes place; and the change of policy would have to be publicly announced if the savings were to be secured. The saving of  6 million on Miscellaneous would haveto fall mainly on local authority offices and their equipment.(ii) If grants for bringing piped water and sewerage to rural development up to now without these facilities were discontinued, this might reduce investment by about  8 million. But, in view of the risk to public health and the likely weightof opposition, the Ministry of Housing do not consider that such savings are practicable.(iii) If savings were required to be made in Scotland and in Wales, they would follow broadly the same pattern as that indicated for England.(c) Increased levelAn increase of 5 per cent could readily be taken up, without any significantpolicy change, simply by relaxing present restraints. In England, the bulk of theincrease would possibly go to Planning, with smaller increases on cleaner riversand beaches and on refuse collection where there is considerable scope and public demand for improvement in the service. In Wales, because of the reassessmentof existing policies, even a 5 per cent increase in the 1966 forecasts would require a reduction of more than one-fifth in current forecasts.

The forecasts for subsequent years assume that localauthority current expenditure on these services will continue to increase by about per cent per annum. Of this 6 per cent, three-quarters or 4^ per cent represents the cost of servicing loans on the capital expenditure programme and the other\\ per cent will be partly taken up by running costs of the new capital works andacquisitions.(ii) The Housing Departments consider that there is no scope for reducing the1967 Survey forecasts of current expenditure save as a consequence of anyreductions in capital expenditure in this field. In their view, the forecasts alreadyassume a negligible increase in existing local authority revenue commitments, and put as much weight as is reasonable on the expectation that local authorities willhave regard to the Governments requests to them to exercise the utmost economy in all branches of administration, including the slowing of the development of some services. They do not consider that there are any specific policy changes whichcould be made to produce further savings.ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 1967 survey and INCREASED AND REDUCED levels b..XTV.

The 1967 forecast for 1970-71 exceeds the 1966 forecast revalued by  9-2 million. This is mainly due to the additional expenditure now expected to be incurred by police authorities on modern equipmentwith a view to the more effective use of manpower.(b) Reduced level(i) This would require a reduction of  30-6 million from the 1967 forecast for1970-71. On the assumption that the provision of equipment should have priorityas a pre-requisite for longer term economies, the reduction would have to betaken by holding back recruitment and new building. If police and civilianstrengths were held to the mid-1967 level, a saving of  23 million in England
and Wales and  1 - 3 million in Scotland would be achieved. To make up thebalance, reductions of about  6 million would need to be sought in the building programme, reducing it by one-third. This would involve the abandonment orindefinite postponement of essential projects and the possibility of obtaining sitesin new towns and other planning developments would have to be foregone. InScotland it would involve a deferment of the police college extension and a halt onthe police housing programme.(ii) Many police forces are already well below their authorised establishment,and a deliberate restriction on recruitment by these authorities could be held toconflict with their statutory duty to maintain efficient police forces. If they couldnot be persuaded to restrict recruitment voluntarily, new statutory powers wouldbe needed. The restriction on numbers could be made rather less severe if greaterreductions were made in the building programme, but even if no new building projects at all were started in 1969-70 and 1970-71 there would still need tobe reductions in manpower yielding about  10 million.(c) Increased levelIn England and Wales, the additional amount over the 1967 basic forecastwould be  3-6 million. This would not be sufficient to meet all the additionalprgorammes submitted ( 4 million for headquarters for amalgamated forces;  million for vehicles for unit beat policing; and  1-3 million for other items,including additional electronic equipment). Within these, priority would be givento the vehicles and equipment. In Scotland  0-8 million would be applied toaccelerating the police building programme and manpower improvements.ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 1967 survey and INCREASED AND REDUCED levels b..XV.

This mainly reflects the revised forecast of prison population. InEngland and Wales the prison and borstal population is now expected to rise from 35,700 in 1967-68 to 43,400 in 1971-72. Capital expenditure is forecast torise from the Budget estimate of  5 million in 1967-68 to  16 - 7 million in 1970-71and  18-2 million in 1971-72, compared with the forecast rise to  9-1 million in1970-71 in the 1966 Survey revalued. This higher forecast represents the minimum which the Home Office consider is required to accommodate the higher numberof prisoners now expected, to implement the Mountbatten recommendations andfor other improvements, e.g., in sanitation. Apart from a supplementary provisionof  2-5 million on capital works in 1967-68, the scale and phasing of this additional expenditure has however not yet been accepted by the Treasury pending the civil expenditure review.
(ii) In Scotland the position is broadly similar. The number of prisoners is forecast to rise from 3,850 to 4,600; and capital expenditure is forecast to rise from  0-8 million to  2-4 million.(b) Reduced levelThis would involve a reduction of  16-3 million (29-6 per cent) in the 1967forecast for 1970-71. It could only be achieved by a drastic reduction in staff,or a large-scale release of prisoners before completing their normal sentence.To achieve the necessary saving in current expenditure by reducing staff wouldinvolve a reduction of about 25 per cent; while if existing staffing and otherstandards were maintained, the prison population would need to be held about ,000-10,000 below the forecast level. Alternatively, a combination of these twomeans would have to be used. It would also be necessary to forego all the additional capital expenditure now proposed for the higher population, better security, andother improvements. Even with all this additional capital expenditure, the numberof prisoners sharing cells in 1971 will be higher than the present figure of 10,000.(c) Increased levelTo keep expenditure down to this level would still involve a reduction of 11 million (20 per cent) in the 1967 forecast for 1970-71. On current expenditureeither staff reductions of about 13 per cent would be needed; or, if standardswere maintained, the necessary reduction in the prison population would be morethan 4.000. Reductions in capital expenditure would also be required, involvingabandonment of the security and accommodation improvements, and of virtually all the provision for additional population. Regular control over the total numberof prisoners would involve introducing special arrangements for early release inaddition to those which will be made possible by the Criminal Justice Bill. Thiswould require further legislation, and Parliament has made it clear during thepassage of that Bill that it is opposed to the use of early release as an instrument of administrative convenience.ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 1967 survey and INCREASED AND REDUCED levels b..XVI.

Capital expenditure on fire services (including the new Fire Service Technical College) is forecast to rise from  8-1 million to  10-1 million. In Scotland, the forecast increase inoperational staff is 90 per annum; and capital expenditure is forecast to rise from  1-0 million to  1-1 million.
(b) Reduced level(i) In order to achieve a reduction of  6-4 million in 1970-71, both staff and capital expenditure would have to be limited. The recent pay award for fire service personnel was linked with an increase in hours. The effect of this will beto offset a substantial amount of the current undermanning. The tendency forestablishments to rise will continue but will be delayed by the more economicaluse of manpower. By 1970-71 the annual increase in manpower might be reducedto something of the order of 400 a year, as opposed to the 800 included in the forecast. This would save  1-0 million in 1970-71. The balance required wouldbe found by limiting the implementation of the Fire Precautions Bill ( 0-4 million),by reducing by  1-0 million the expenditure on vehicles and equipment and bysaving  3-5 million on building work. In Scotland holding strengths at theestimated 1968-69 level would contribute  0-2 million and a further  0-3 million would be found if no new buildings were started from 1968-69 onwards.(ii) Legislation would be required to control the recruitment, strength andequipping of fire service personnel. Fire authorities have a statutory duty toprovide efficient fire services for their areas, and the fire service is alreadydeficient of staff and brigades are anxious to expand equipment. Direct annualfire losses have reached over  80 million which would make a decision to keepstrengths below the requirements of fire authorities open to public criticism.(c) Increased levelIn England and Wales the increased expenditure would mainly be devotedto accelerating work on the Fire Service Technical College and other trainingprojects, to improvements in communications, and to water schemes, whilst inScotland the whole of any increase of this order would be absorbed by acceleration of the fire service building programme. The recommendations of the DepartmentalCommittee on the Fire Service, which has not yet reported, could lead to other proposals for increased expenditure, including a substantial building programmeof headquarters for the larger brigades likely to be recommended.ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 1967 survey and INCREASED AND REDUCED levels b..XVII.

The number of child care officers is forecast to rise from 3,100 to 4,200. The 1967 forecast for England and Walesexceeds the revalued 1966 forecast by  2-3 million, mainly reflecting the revisedforecast of local authority expenditure on child care officers and supporting staff and administrative costs.  (See also Section 21.)
(b) Reduced level(i) Local Authority Child Care Service. So long as local authorities retain a statutory obligation to receive children into care, they cannot avoid expenditure onchildren&apos;s homes or boarding-out. Nearly all capital expenditure on local childcare is on new children&apos;s homes; on current expenditure local authorities wouldseem to have no alternative but to forego their proposed increase of 1,125 childcare officers ( 2-8 million) and to refrain from replacing wastage so as to allow the 1967-68 staff (2,900) to fall by say 800 officers ( 2 million), which wouldbe the greater part of the officers engaged upon advisory and preventive work:this would nullify Section 1 of the Children and Young Persons Act, 1963.(ii) Approved Schools and Remand Homes. To find  1-7 million in this field in England and Wales would require drastic action. Legislation would berequired either to reduce the maximum period of detention or to restrict further the age range of the children who may be committed. If the maximum periodof detention was reduced to 2 years, a total saving in the capital works programmeof  3-5 million would be produced of which about  1-1 million would be savedin 1970-71. A similar effect would be achieved by imposing a minimum age limit for committal of 12 years or a maximum age of 16^ years. To cut back thebuilding programme without easing pressure on accommodation would result in serious overcrowding at existing schools. The remaining saving of about  0-million would have to come from reductions in staff and would involve cutting the forecast requirement by about 280 posts or about 8 per cent. A reduction of  0&apos;3 million in Scotland (corresponding to  1-7 million above) would involve similar difficulties.(iii) The effect of all these cuts would be seriously to reduce standards of care, training and supervision.(c) Increased level(i) With an increased provision of only  0-7 million more than the 1967Survey forecast for 1970-71 it would not be possible to make much progress on thefollowing projects:  millionEngland and Wales(a) Family Service (provision of 400 additional child care officers) ... 0-9(b) Additional local authority grants to voluntary bodies   ...... 0-5(c) Young offenders (600 additional child care officers)      ...... 1-4(d) Abolition of parental contributions       ............ 1-4(e) Additional training programmes............... 0-scotland(f) Social work reorganisation in Scotland............ 0-95-7(ii) The order in which these will come forward depends mainly upon the priority accorded to legislation for the establishment of a family service and the reform of the law on young offenders in England and Wales and for there organisation of Social Work Services in Scotland.ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 1967 survey and INCREASED AND REDUCED levels b..XVIII.

(a) Continuation of existing policies(i) The programme is at a higher level than the 1966 programme and reductions would be required even to achieve the &quot; increased&quot; level. For the mostpart, expenditure is related to existing buildings and staff. Current expenditure(mainly on rents and maintenance) and expenditure on cars, furniture, and minorworks are chiefly of this kind. In order to have a substantial effect on expenditurein the Survey period, reductions would have to made in the new works programme.(ii) New works expenditure is mainly responsible for the increase over the 1966Survey, as significant new demands for accommodation have since emerged, e.g.,computer centres for Inland Revenue, Ministry of Social Security, and Ministry ofTransport; the Royal Mint decimal factory; and an expansion of the Ministry ofLabour programme of Government Training Centres. (As these examples show,the policy decisions which lead to demands for additional buildings are generallyoutside the control of the Ministry of Public Building and Works.)(iii) Not all major new works expenditure is open to review. It would, forinstance, be uneconomic to find savings by stopping projects already in progress.For the purpose of the present exercise, an arbitrary line has been drawn at theend of the current financial year and all projects starting in 1967-68 have been included with works in progress in a category of &quot; committed &quot; expenditure. Infact, some savings could be made in this field; but quick decisions would be needed to achieve this. Projects due to start in or after 1968-69 are categorised as&quot; uncommitted &quot;.(iv) The following table analyses the 1967 Survey figures by types ofexpenditure:  million1967 Survey prices	1968-69	1969-70		1970-71Current expenditure      ......	450	46-7		48-5Cars, furniture and minor works ...	10-8	10-5		10-6Major new  works  programmes (&quot; uncommitted &quot; expenditure in								brackets^......     ......	19-2* (5-7)	23-9 (12-12		24-9 (18-6)of which				Science and research buildings	2-5 (1-0)	3-8 (3	0)	3-7 (3-5)Museums and arts buildings	1-7 (0-2)	2-3 (0	9)	1-8(1-0)Government Training Centres	1-5 (0-5)	1-6(1	4)	1-6(1-5)Offices............	12-8(3-4)	14-6(6	6)	16-2(11-0)Other accommodation	1-7(0-6)	1-6(0	9)	1-6(1-6)Totals    ......	750	81-1		840(b) Reduced levelA reduction of  13-5 million in 1970-71 would involve abandoning virtually all &quot; uncommitted &quot; schemes, especially in the early years of the Survey period. Inpractice, it would probably be necessary to cancel some schemes due to start in1967-68 to enable &quot; uncommitted &quot; schemes of the highest priority to go ahead.MPBW consider that achievement of the reduced level of expenditure would present them with insoluble problems, especially in 1968-69 and 1969-70.(c) Increased levelThe increased level would entail a reduction from the 1967 Survey figures ofabout  4 million in 1970-71, or about 18 per cent in total expenditure on major new works (33 per cent on &quot; uncommitted &quot; expenditure) in the period 1968-69 to* The individual programmes do not add up to this total because an allowance of  1 million ismade for schemes which may not be carried out within the year.XIX.

If this additional expenditure is not approved, the Ministry would propose to make thenecessary provision for New Towns by reducing their housing allocations to localauthorities.2. The Ministry of Housing and the Welsh Office are also seeking approval for an extra  24 million in 1970-71 for housing in the proposed further NewTown developments, most of which are at an advanced stage of consideration(The  13 million and  24 million for New Towns, together with  10 million for extra local authority housing make up the extra  47 million referred to in annex A, Item II, paragraph 7.) Here again, if the cost is not approved as additional expenditure, the Housing Departments would propose to meet it byoffsetting reductions in local authority housing. There is, however, in practiceno question of obtaining offsetting savings in other public expenditure programmes.If therefore the New Towns programme is to go ahead as proposed, approval willbe required for increases in 1970-71 of  3 million on roads and  6 million on environmental services (mainly for financing industrial and commercial property).The additional expenditure in 1970-71 would therefore be:  millionEnvironmentalHousing Roads        Services TotalExisting new towns (includingMilton Keynes)    ...... 13     13Furtherproposed developments 24 3 6 33Total   ......... 37 3 6 46The total of Development Corporations expenditure would thus rise to about 140 million by 1970-71. The bulk of the cost of the further proposed New Townsdevelopments would of course fall outside the period of the current Survey.4. The additional expenditure on these developments in 1970-71 could behalved if, for example, Peterborough and all the projects approved in principle(Ipswich, Northampton, Warrington, Leyland/Chorley and Newtown) proceededat somewhat reduced rates of build-up; and if expenditure on Ashford, Wellington/Oakengates and Llantrisant was deferred until after 1970-71.
