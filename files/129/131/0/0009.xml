jjtfS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY lS GOVERNMENT)C16H109 COPY NO.24th June^ 1967CABINETTHE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF PUBLIC expenditure memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer at their last meeting the Ministerial Steering Committee onEconomic Policy invited me to comment on the note by officials onthe &quot;Economic Implications of Public Expenditure&quot; (C(67) 105).They agreed that it represented a useful first step in evolving more realistic criteria for judging between different programmes of public expenditure but thought that more study was needed of the points raised in the note with a view to further refinements of those criteria.2.     In trying to bring to bear on our review of public expenditure the suggestions put forward in paragraph 11 of the note the cabinet will recognise the limited purpose which the suggestions are intendedto serve.    Only one facet of public expenditure is considered:  itscost in terms of the additional burden that it places on domesticresources or, alternatively, the increase in taxation necessary inorder to keep the pressure on resources unchanged.    No account istaken of other facets of public expenditure: for example, the benefits in more rapid growth (capital expenditure and current expenditure are treated on the same footing); the effect on incentives to work andsave; the value to the community of one form of public servicecompared with another; and so on.    The argument is focussed entirely on the relationship between expenditure and taxation without regard tothe merits of the various   types of expenditure in their own right.3,     It would be a mistake, therefore, to expect too much at thissto&amp;ge, from the new method of analysis.    It is a useful technicaladvance that allows us to form a more accurate judgment of the realcost of various types of expenditure but does not by itself show us how to judge between them.    It has an important bearing on two areas of choice: the balance that we strike between expenditure on goods and services on the one hand and on transfers on the other; and the severity with which we should treat expenditure with a high importcontent or expenditure overseas.    It also has an important bearing onthe size of the adjustment in public expenditure that would be necessaryin order to keep the change in taxation over the next few years withindefined limits.-1.
4.     So far as the distinction between different forms of domesticexpenditure is concerned, I doubt whether we are in a position to gomuch further than treat goods and services under one heading andtransfers to persons under another.    There may be significantdifferences between one form of transfer payment and another; andthere are good rea.sons for regarding expenditure on services asexerting greater pressure on the economy than expenditure on goods.But the differences between transfer payments are usually not large enough to warrant any finer analysis?   and in any form of Governmentactivity the purchase of services is usually so much intertwined withthe purchase of goods, e. g. the construction of more schools,hospitals, and the current expenditure that goes with them, that itwould in practice be difficult to insist strongly on separating the two categories of expenditure,5r     The SEP Committee had some difficulty over two points inparagraph 11 of C(67) 105 and I agree that the argument of thisparagraph is much too crude to be accepted without importantreservations.    The first point arises in paragraph 11(a) where it issuggested that &quot;output per head in the public sector is much lower than in the private sector&quot;.    As I understand the argument, it doesnot imply any intrinsic difference between the public and private sectors in the efficiency with which manpower is used or in the socialvalue of the work done.    The argument is also not intended to applyto the nationalised industries which are akin to the private sectorin producing goods and services for sale to the public on commercialcriteria.    The distinction that is being drawn is between work for a profit-making employer in the private sector and work for a non-profit-making employer in the public sector.    It is a well-establishedfact that a given change in the output of the private sector tends to be associated - in the short to medium term at least - with a much smaller change in employment.    In fact, a fall of 1 per cent in output (about  350 million) is normally accompanied by a drop inemployment of   per cent (about 125,000 workers, earning in wagesabout  125 million a year).     These relationships suggest that overa period cf a year or two the recruitment of a given number of workers to Government service on a scale involving an outlay of   125 millionv/ould require a reduction in private demand, and consequently would entail a reduction in output, well in excess of this in order to keeptotal employment constant.    The difference would be less s triking inthe longer run but it would be likely to remain substantial.6.      The second point arises in paragraph 11(b), where it seems tobe implied that military expenditure abroad has an import content of100 per cent.    This, of course, goes too far.     Part of what is spentby troops stationed abroad is on exports from this country.    Thereare also various offsetting gains including, for example, payments made to us under offset agreements.    The import content of defence expenditure is being further examined in the Ministry of Defence and Iunderstand that a paper is in course of preparation.7.     I suggest, therefore, that we ask for further refinement of the analysis oxitlined to be undertaken, and in the meantime take account in our discussion of the distinction drawn in the note between expendi-ture on goods and services and transfer payments but do not try to do more than allow for this broad distinction.    With this in mind I have inmy other paper (C(67) 104) kept separate the discussion on transfers(paragraph 9) from that on other forms of expenditure in paragraph 8.L. J. C*Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1,23rd June, 1967 -2-confidential
