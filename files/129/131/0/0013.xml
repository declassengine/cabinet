K^-fJ^.!!!:^!!^ HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(67)113 R A-J 1- COPY NO.      P j28th June, 1967CABINETPETROLEUM prices memorandum by the Minister of power the Middle East situation imposes extra costs on the oil industry,here and in Western Europe.    Supplies from the Persian Gulf (still our main source) have to come by the long haul round the Cape.     Tankerrates have rocketed.    Most companies are having to draw expensiveoil from the Western Hemisphere.     These factors particularly affectUnited Kingdom supplies (with the ban in Arab states directed at us),2,       United Kingdom oil companies have indicated to my department that unless revenue can be increased through higher prices here they willnot be able to make the necessary arrangements to maintain supplies.Separately, they have made proposals for price increases, supportedby detailed estimates of costs.     These proposals have been dealt with under early warning arrangements, but the Ministry would have beenasked to give guidance in any case.3.       We have examined the various cost estimates and I am satisfiedthat they are the best that can be made on the information now available.The prospects for each company are different but for the leadingcompanies, covering over 7 5 per cent of the market, there is nodoubt that the costs of oil supplies will on average be increasedtemporarily by at least  2 a ton.    The rise in costs is nearly allin foreign exchange;  the present crisis if it lasts for six monthsmay cost us about  60-80 million in extra foreign exchange.     Thereis no escape from paying more for our oil.    Our stocks are good butwe cannot rely on them to do more than see us through for a few monthswhile the temporary supply arrangements are made;  companies will haveto draw heavily on stocks for the next tv/o months in any case,4.       The increased costs have to be met through surcharges which ifspread evenly, as the leading companies advocate, would be equivalentto 2d. a gallon on all products.     This would cause the least distortionto refinery runs and the state of competition in the market and was broadly the approach adopted during the Suez crisis,    (At the time of Suez, thefirst surcharges (December, 1956) were 3-ld, a gallon on fuel oil, 3^-d.a gallon on motor spirit (plus a duty increase of Is, and an increase ofdealers&apos; margins by ljd. ) and 3d, a gallon on all other products.    InMarch, 1957, the surcharges were increased to 4^-d. a gallon on fuel oil, motor spirit and Derv, and 4d, on all other products).
5,       It would minimise the effect on the economy if the surcharges couldbear more heavily on petrol than on other products.    But the scope forvariation is not large:  only 15 per cent of total sales are petrol so a Id.a gallon addition to the surcharge on petrol reduces the surcharges on other products by only ^d. a gallon on average.6,      Moreover, we cannot ignore the smaller companies v/ho do notdeal in petrol but face increased costs on other products:  unless theycan cover their costs, there would be no incentive for them to securethe supplies we need.    The balance of products from refineries is also important:  in particular we must do everything possible to rebuild stocksof fuel oil (45 per cent of output) in preparation for the winter;  we cannot do this unless there is a reasonable return to the companies,7,       Finally, there is the question of the Governments formal position.Our powers over petroleum products are those under the Prices and incomes Act, 1966, which are clearly unsuitable for this situation.During Suez there were special powers over prices.     These no longerexist, but I propose to include similar powers in new legislation requiredin the near future to enable rationing to be introduced without relying onthe cumbersome procedures of emergency regulations.    In the meantime,however, the Government1 s role can only be advisory.proposals.      I consider that we should agree to an increase of  2 per ton of crude and I think we should weight the increase on gasoline by allowing the price^to increase by 4d. a gallon.     The surcharge on other mainproducts would then be about lfd. a gallon.     The leading companies would accept a solution on these lines though it was not what they sought(paragraph 4 above).    It gives the widest practicable differentiation betweenprices and as mentioned in paragraph 6 above a smaller surcharge on fuel oil would undoubtedly adversely affect the ability of the companies to stockfuel oil ready for the winter,9.      It will be made absolutely clear that the surcharges are temporary and will be kept under review.    We cannot rule out, however, thepossibility that costs will rise still further.     There is great urgencybecause companies cannot commit themselves to sufficient new suppliesuntil they are sure of revenue, prices have already risen in mostWestern European countries, and there is a danger of some smallcompanies, faced with difficult circumstances, breaking ranks on prices.10.      I recommend my colleagues to agree that I should announceincreases as proposed in paragraph 8, as soon as possible.R.W. M,Minis try of Power, S. W. 1.28th June, 1967
