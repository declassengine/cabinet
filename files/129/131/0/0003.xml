part one: summary reportIntroductionThis is the Seventh Annual Report on public expenditure by the Public Expenditure survey committee. It deals, as usual, with the expenditureof the whole public sector, and so includes thecurrent and capital expenditure of central andlocal government, the gross outgoings of theNational Insurance Funds, and the capitalexpenditure of public corporations (althoughamong the latter the nationalised industries andcertain other bodies are controlled in a differentway from the rest); but it excludes debt interest at such (though see paragraph 8 of Part four of the Report on Methodology).2 Most figures in this Report are at constant prices. The price basis (referred to in the report as fat 1967 Survey prices&apos;) is explained more fully in Part Four on Methodology. The purposeof using constant prices is to bring out the rateof change over time of the demand which willbe made on resources by public expenditure in aggregate, or by any single functional block.However, the conventions necessarily embodied in&apos; 1967 Survey prices&apos; provide only an imperfectmeasure of this. The effect of this on the totalfigures is probably not significant; but it couldbe more marked when comparing relative ratesof growth of different functional blocks. Apartfrom this, different types of public expenditurerepresent different degrees of impact of demandupon real resources.3 This Report is agreed by the public expenditure Survey Committee as giving asrealistic a costing at 1967 Survey prices as isnow possible of the continuation of existing policies. It is recognised that it is not equallypossible in all fields of public expenditure to interpret the meaning of Existing policies&apos; overthe full five year period, and the detailed materialgiven in Part Three sets out the policyassumptions which have been made in arriving at the figures used. Where it has not beenpossible to reach agreement, the differences between the Treasury and the responsiblespending Department are indicated. The figures in this Report do not in general include any provision for policies or projects which have notvet been agreed. The aim has been to indicate the probable development of public expenditureup to 1971-72 if Ministers were, broadly speaking,to continue pursuing their current policies.Apart from the contingency allowance (seeparagraph 13 below) nothing is included for new policies or major new developments of existing policies. These have been taken into account in another report by the Committee (1967 Report on public Expenditure to 1971-72 : Areas of Choice).The purpose of the present Report is to indicate to Ministers how public expenditure is developingnow. The companion report indicates ways inwhich the rate of growth and the pattern can be changed.Economic growth4 The forward estimation of certain types ofpublic expenditure can only be done on the basisof an assumption about the prospective rate of growth of the economy as a whole. Thus,expenditure on investment grants over the next five years is a function of the likely level ofprivate investment, which is largely determinedby industry&apos;s expectations about the level of demand generally. Increases in social security benefits have been calculated (without prejudice to ultimate policy decisions) in relation to aprospective rate of increase in real earnings per head, which again can only be assessed inrelation to an assumed rate of economic growth;for these and for certain other types ofexpenditure similarly affected, as well as for the forward estimation of investment by the nationalised industries, etc., a rate of growth inthe economy of 3 per cent per annum has been assumed.General background5 In 1965 in pursuance of its policy of controlling the rate of growth of public sector expenditure in relation to the rate of growth ofthe economy, the Government announced thatthe rate of growth of total public expenditure between 1964-65 and 1969-70 should not exceed,on average and at constant prices, 4  per cent per annum. On this basis a total for public sector expenditure in 1969-70 was arrived at and decisions were taken by Ministers on itsallocation. Nearly 80 per cent of the availabletotal was allocated to nine main functional blocks,the remaining 20 per cent being what wasreckoned to be the minimum needed to cover therest.6 The decisions taken then, which were published as part of the National Plan, wererelated to the rate of economic growth assumed in that Plan, viz., an average of 3-8 per cent per annum, between 1964 and 1970. It has nowbeen recognised that this rate of economic growthwill not be achieved in the period originallyenvisaged, and as part of the planning operationannounced by the First Secretary of State on10th November, 1966, the Government have made it clear that they are now reviewing the whole range of public expenditure with a view to making whatever adjustments may be needed inthe forward figures to take account of the changed economic picture.7 For this purpose reviews of the five largestcivil expenditure blocks have been conducted.The purpose of these was two-fold. On the onehand it was to identify ways in which total public expenditure could, if necessary, be reduced,&apos; andto make clear what were the policy implications of doing so. On the other hand, it was to enable ministers, if they wished, to re-shape the pattern3SECRET
of public expenditure; that is, to adjust the priorities between the different blocks by increasing the rate of growth of some at theexpense of others. To this end the Departmentsconcerned have set out in the companion report.the implications of making both increases anddecreases in their expenditure. A similar exercisewas also carried out over other relevant civil expenditure. At the same time, defence studieshave been initiated with a view to considering what are the possibilities of reducing defence expenditure in total, and what such reductions would mean for defence policy.8 The following table sets out in summary formthe figures arrived at on the basis of a continuation of existing policies, compared withthe 1966 Survey figures at 1967 Survey prices.TABLE ATotal Public Expenditure (excludingnationalised industries, etc.)  million at 1967 Survey prices	1966 Survey	1967 Survey1966-67 .	13,080-8	13,079-0 (outturn)1967-68 .	14,167-4	14,382-31968-69 .	14,842-3	15,372-01969-70 .	15,303-8	15,656-81970-71 .	15,786-4	16,155-01971-72 .	-	16,588-49 In previous years attention has been centredin the Public Expenditure Survey on the finalyear of the Survey, in order that Ministers might reach decisions on broad planning limits into which the pattern of growth in the intervening years could be fitted. This year it is suggestedthat special consideration needs to be given to:(i) 1968-69, because the Government faces a difficult budgetary prospect in that year,which will need special attention;(ii) 1970-71, because that is the year to which,following Ministers&apos; instructions, thematerial provided in the accompanyingreport on &apos;Areas of Choice&apos; has beenrelated; and(iii) 1971-72, because of the need to determinelimits for longer term programmes withinwhich forward commitments may be planned.1968-6910 The forecast total (excluding capital expendi-ture by the nationalised industries, etc.) for1968-69 is  15,372 million, an increase of  990million or 6-9 per cent over 1967-68. this compares with an average annual increase of 2-6per cent between 1968-69 and 1971-72. Thisdisproportionately high rate of increase inone year appears to be the result of the coincidenceof a number of special non-recurrent factors.In particular, investment grants show a rise of 187 million largely because of the acceleratedpayment of grant and the temporary increase in rates of grant; roads expenditure shows anincrease of  73 million over the reduced expend-ture for 1967-68 following the cut imposed on1967-68 and earlier years; there is a sharp increaseof  64 million for the first full year of Rgpthe forecast rise in public housing investment is  57 million, partly because of the wide introduction of the Parker Morris  standards; inaddition the proposed  50 million contingencvallowance is included. Excluding SET additional payments,  REP  and   investment  grants (seeparagraph 14, below), the increase in 1968-69over 1967-68 is  742 million or 5-3 per cent the comparable figures for earlier years are:1965-66 (estimate)-1966-67 (estimate) : 2-8 per cent1965-66 (outturn)-1966-67 (outturn)  : 4 - 6 per cent1966-67 (estimate)-1967-68 (estimate) : 7-6 per cent1966-67 (outturn)-1967-68 (estimate) : 7-6 per cent1970-7111 The comparable forecast total for 1970-71is  16,155 million inclusive of provision for the contingency allowance. It is to this total thatthe possible additions and reductions in civil expenditure set out in the report on &apos;Areas of choice&apos; relate. As it stands it represents an average annual increase over 1967-68 of 4 per cent.1971-7212 Inevitably, over a considerable part of public expenditure, the further into the future a forecastreaches, the less certain the figures must become.Nevertheless 1971-72 is important, not only because, for certain fields of long-lead expenditure,decisions will be taken in the next 12 monthswhich will determine part of the public sectofs1971-72 expenditure; but also because the planning operation now being conducted underthe DEA looks forward to 1972, and if public expenditure figures are to be published as partof any revised Plan which may be produced,this is the year to which they will have to be related.Contingency allowance13 Ministers have agreed that there should bea contingency allowance of  250 million in1970-71. This is intended to provide a marginfor changes in circumstances and to supplementexisting methods for controlling expenditure. the contingency allowance will not be allocated to individual programmes and is intended to cover the whole range of civil expenditure (excludingnationalised industries, etc.). It is proposed thatthere should be the following progression to  250million:  50 million in 1968-69,  150 million in1969-70, and  250 million in each of the years1970-71 and 1971-72.Investment grants and SET payments14 As was explained in paragraph 15 of the 1966Report, for purposes of comparison with, the4  per cent commitment which related specifically -cally to the period 1964-65 to 1969-70, investment grants and Selective Employment Tax (SET) addi-tional payments* were excluded from the 1969-70total. An adjustment of this kind is appropriate fora comparison involving any year which does not* That is to say, the part of the premium payments to manufacturing industry which exceeds the SET paid. no account is taken in the Report of refunds of SET or that part of the premium payment which is equivalent to SETpaid.
include these items or does not include them infull. But when the absolute level of public expendi-ture in any given year is being considered, it is appropriate to include these items in total public expenditure figures as in the Tables in this Report(which also include the Regional EmploymentPremiums).Parts, Two, Three and Four of the Report15 Part Two provides Tables analysing public expenditure by function and economic category,function and spending authority, and gross domestic fixed capital formation by function andcategory of asset. (Summaries of the functional,economic and spending authority analyses areappended to Part One.) Part Three containsdetailed Tables and notes on each functionalheading, and Annexes on Transport and NewTown Corporations.

The equivalent at1967 Survey prices of this base figure has there fore been shown for the target year of the studies. The figures for the remaining yearsremain subject to review, both in the light of the detailed implementation of the Defence review and because of the Defence Studies, which maywell affect the Budget total in earlier as well asin later years. Figures equivalent at 1967 survey prices to  2,000 million at 1964 prices have therefore been shown for 1968-69 and 1969-70.For 1971-72, costings of the present programmesuggest that the level of expenditure would beabout the same as in 1970-71 and the 1970-71figure has therefore been repeated in thiscolumn.2   Other Military DefenceTABLE 2  million at 1967 Survey priiprices		1967-68	1968-69	1969-70	1970-	-71	1971-72a.

The principles on which the United Kingdomgives overseas military aid are currently underreview. The figures cover disbursements in future years- of grants and loans already offered withcertain continuing liabilities for assistance independent territories and elsewhere.b. The treatment of the payments in respect ofthese aircraft is as follows:(i) Progress payments in respect of thepurchase and associated research anddevelopment costs are included in this item (line b. of &apos;Other Military Defence&apos;),although they are in fact financed fromthe United States credit.(ii) Repayments of the credit, and the interestthereon,   are   charged   to   the   defence budget; but, because such payments donot form part of public expenditure, theyare offset by equal but negative entries in line b. of &apos;Other Military Defence&apos;.The minus entries for 1970-71 and 1971-72 in line b. thus result from the falling off in progresspayments and the build-up of interest payments and capital repayments.c.

Both (b) and (c) have been substantially affected by the changes inarrangements for financing roads expenditure setout in the Local Government Act, 1966, and(apart from maintenance and lighting of motor-ways and trunk roads, which are Exchequerresponsibilities) expenditure in these categories isnow Exchequer assisted only through the rate support Grant. One result will be that this expenditure will be less susceptible to accurateforecasting or central control than in the past.3 Last year provision was made for a basic programme of total expenditure on roads risingby about 41-5 per cent in the four year period to 1970-71; that is, from  452-1 million in1966-67 to  639-6 million in 1970-71. Theprogramme has, however, been affected by theexpenditure cuts which were announced following the economic measures of 20th July, 1966, andthe further reductions agreed by Ministers last november. The net effect has been to reduce theprovision for 1967-68 by  19-4. million.4 Prior to last year&apos;s Report there was no clear evidence of price increases over the previous yearand no adjustments were made to the road programme element of the block. This year,taking into account the effects of SET, it isestimated that road construction prices have risen by about 5  per cent since the last adjustment,and land prices by considerably more than this;appropriate adjustments have been made to theroad programme, which is now based on pricesniling at mid-1966. Maintenance costs rose by&apos; per cent, net of productivity changes, about which there is conflicting evidence, and the effects of SET on prices.  The  part of the blockrepresenting Rate Support Grant expenditure hasbeen increased by 6 per cent, the amount agreed for price increases during the Rate support grant negotiations with local authorities lastyear.5 For 1971-72 the total of roads expenditureshown in the Report is  760 - 2 million, an increaseof  32-5 million or 4-5 per cent over the figure for 1970-71. This would not prejudge a decisionto accelerate or decelerate the rate of growth in later years and therefore represents a continuation of existing policy taking into account the pattern of commitments implicit in the figures for earlier years.6 The figures in Table 3 include no provision for public expenditure on infrastructure projects otherthan roads, foreshadowed in the Transport white paper. The cost could reach  29 million a yearby the 1970s.England7 Last years,forecast of expenditure in 1970-71has been increased to take account of price increases which account for  37-4 million; therecosting of existing programmes; adjustmentswhich were agreed as part of the Rate support grant negotiations; and a statistical adjustment to the local authority element of the road programme. The total increase amounts to  78-4 million. There has also been a substantial transfer from current to capital expenditure as a result ofthe redefinition of minor improvements whichare now included among capital works.Wales8 The Welsh total for 1970-71 exceeds that putforward last year by  5-3 million.  2-8 million of this represents a recosting of the existing programme and there is a small amount for the adjustments agreed during the Rate support grant negotiations. The balance is in respectof price increases.Scotland9 For Scotland, last year&apos;s basic programme for1970-71 is increased, on account of price changes,by  4-1 million.note: Annex 1 brings together in tabular form summarydata on transport.SECRET25

Part Three: Detailed Analysis of ProgrammesHouse price5 (i) The assumed house prices in the survey for local authorities are as follows:1967	1968	1969	1970	1971-68	-69	-70	-71	-72 	 	 	 	 3,500	3,580	3,560	3,522	3,5223,117	3,197	3,177	3,139	3,1393,425	3,435	3,440	3,445	3,445EnglandWalesScotlandThe prices used in England and Wales reflectprogress to full Parker Morris standards by 1st January, 1969, offset by the imposition of newcost yardsticks. The prices in Scotland reflect the greater attention to layout and landscapingwhich the Scottish Development Department isurging.(ii) For New Towns the assumed house prices are:1967     1968     1969     1970     1971-68       -69       -70       -71       -72         England . 3,710 Throughout the periodWales . 3,400 Throughout the periodScotland     .     3,280     3,290     3,310    3,335     3,335The prices in England and Wales show noincreases over the period as new towns alreadybuild to Parker Morris standards. The presentforecast prices in Scotland derive from a higherestimate reflecting a proposed improvement of standards to local authority levels offset by savings of scale from larger contracts and bulk purchaseof standardised components. It may be thatthis increase will be offset somewhat by theintroduction of cost standards.(iii) For the Scottish Special Housing association the assumed prices are:1967-68 3,9001968-69 3,7851969-70 3,6701970-71 3,5551971-72 3,555The SSHA house prices are higher than theScottish Local Authority prices mainly becausethe Association at present builds on moredifficult sites. By 1970-71 the differential shouldbe reduced as a large proportion of the SSHAprogramme will be in the outskirts of Glasgowwhere there should be no site difficulties.b. Housing subsidies and improvement grants6 Public subsidies comprise payments by theMinistry of Housing, the Scottish DevelopmentDepartment and the Welsh Office to localauthorities in respect of houses completed and contributions from local authority Rate Funds totheir Housing Revenue Accounts. Private housing subsidies are payments by the Housing Depart-ments to assist in reducing the interest payments on mortgages taken out by owner-occupiers of limited means. Mortgagees benefiting from thesesubsidies will surrender their entitlement to tax relief on the interest paid on the mortgage.7 Improvement grants are paid by local authori-ties in respect of certain improvements made bythe owners of private houses.c. Other housing8 Local authorities act as lenders of last resortin making house mortgage loans to borrowers incertain categories of housing need. In Englandand Wales their total lending is restricted to 130 million per annum gross. There is noquantitative limit in Scotland but local authorities may lend only to certain categories of borrower.9 Local authorities may also make loans tocertain types of Housing Associations to meethousing need and may lend money to owners ofprivate houses to assist them in making improve-ments.10 Expenditure by cost rent Housing Associa-tions under the pilot scheme set up under theHousing Act, 1961, is expected to cease by1968-69, but advances by the Housing Corpora-tion under the Housing Act, 1964, will increase as the Corporation gets into its stride. these advances will be offset by repayments fromBuilding Societies of advances made under theHouse Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, toenable them &quot;to make loans on houses built before1919.S Education (with School Meals and Milk)TABLE 5   million at 1967 Survey prices1967-68       1968-69       1969-70       1970-71       1971-72Capital1.

The new figures also allow forpolicies embodied in the expenditure limits laid more recent estimates of the real cost of somedown in 1965 and repeated in the 1966 Survey, programmes, notably teacher supply: see para-modified by decisions taken by Ministers in the graph 9.
England and WalesRevaluation2 The reeosting of the figures in the 1966Survey to 1967 prices adds  72 million, or rather less than 4 per cent, in 1970-71. The increase inthe building cost limits for all educationalprogrammes at various dates between July 1966and April 1967 adds about  23 million (7 per cent)to the figures for capital expenditure. on current account the increase is  49 million (3 percent), resulting mainly from a variety of increases in prices and pay (excluding teachers&apos; pay) in thelocal authority sector which were accepted forthe purposes of the Rate Support Grant,together with an increase from 1st April, 1966, inthe salaries of university teachers.capital expenditure3 The programme assumes the building startsshown below.Educational building (starts)   million	1967	1968	1969	1970	1971	-68	-69	-70	-71	-72.Schools .	131-5	150-0	1500	174-5	149-5Universities   .	35-1	29-0	29-0	30-0	300Further					education	30-5	30-7	36-3	34-0	340Teacher					training	8-5	7-8	8-4	9-0	6-6Youth service .	4-8	4-8	5-0	5-4	5-4Total	210-4	222-3	228-7	252-9	225-5Schools4 The programmes for primary and secondary schools are designed to provide for the growth in and movement of school population and for raising the school-leaving age in 1970-71, withsome margin for the improvement and replace-ment of old schools. In the Treasury&apos;s view thestarts figures for 1970-71 and 1971-72 includeexcessive provision for this latter purpose, andalso exaggerate the sums required to make good the shortfall in the provision for the growth and movement of population in previous years. they believe that for these reasons the startsprogrammes in those two years should be reducedby  29-5 million and  4-5 million respectively togive reductions in expenditure of  4 million (on land) in 1969-70,  7 million in 1970-71 and 17 million in 1971-72.Universities&apos;S The programmes are designed to provideplaces for the rise in student numbers to the target of 218,000 in the academic year 1973-74recommended by the Robbins Committee and accepted by the Government. The aim is todevelop the new universities and the formercolleges of advanced technology to economic size,and to provide for the essential needs of the otheruniversities, including the replacement of obsov-lescent buildings, for medical school expansion,and for some margin of capacity for the yearsafter 1973-74 when student numbers will risemore sharply. The Treasury&apos;s view is that theprovision in 1970-71 and 1971-72 should notexceed the levels of 1968-69 and 1969-70, i.e., 29 million.Further education6 The further education programmes aregeared to projections of student numbers up to1973-74. These allow for the effect of theIndustrial Training Act, 1964, and for somediversion of students from universities intoadvanced courses of further education now that more school leavers are expected to qualify for higher education than the numbers projected inthe Robbins Report. Although the latestprojections of student numbers to 1973-74 are somewhat higher than those made last year, no increase is assumed in real terms in the startsprogrammes. The Treasury continue to believethat a programme above  30-6 million in1969-70 (the same in real terms as last year&apos;sfigure for that year of  27 million) is not justifiedor realistic. This lower level of starts would yielda saving in expenditure of  7-4 million over theperiod 1968 to 1972 ( 0-5 million in 1968-69, 0-6 million in 1969-70,  2-8 million in 1970-71,and  3-5 million in 1971-72).Teacher training7 The teacher training starts programmes, whichare geared to the announced target of 111,000places in 1973-74, are  8 million less in real terms than those assumed last year when, in turn,they were  17 million less than those assumed in 1965. This, results in the main from the response of the colleges of education to theSecretary of State&apos;s productivity campaign, whichis expected to yield up, to 21,000 extra placesat a cost of  6-12 million compared with 36 million by conventional building. TheTreasury consider that, by deferring the beginningof the next phase of physical expansion and by reducing the provision proposed for improvementsthe starts programmes should be reduced in totalby about  5 million giving a saving in expenditureof about  6 million over the period 1968 to 1972( 0-1 million in 1967-68,  0-7 million in 1968-69, 2 million in 1969-70,  1-7 million in 1970-71and  1-9 million in 1971-72).Computers for universities8 Included in the provision (both capital and current) for universities but not in the table ofbuilding starts above is provision for the Flowersprogramme of purchase of computers foruniversities, which covers the six years 1966-67to 1971-72. The proposed provision, which isbased on the Computer Board&apos;s assessment of theprogramme, brings the total expenditure over the six years to about  28-6 million. The Treasuryconsider that, until agreement has been reached on the Board&apos;s figures, which have not yet been presented to them, the programme should remain at the former level of about  23-8 million.
current expenditurePrimary and secondary schools9 The number of teachers (full-time equivalents)is forecast to rise by 23 per cent from 316,000 in1967 to 390,000 in 1972. The forecast for 1972is 17,000 less than the forecast made last yearbecause of revised estimates of wastage. Thecorresponding difference in 1971 is 14,000 and thereduction in expenditure in 1970-71 is  25 million.10 Over the period from 1967 to 1972 thenumber of pupils, allowing for the raising of theschool leaving age in 1971, is expected to rise by18 per cent. There should thus be some improvement in staffing standards, at a cost ofabout  25 million in 1971-72. In primary schools the staffing ratio (qualified teachers only) isestimated to improve from 29-5 to 26-8, with theprospect of achieving by 1974 the ratio of 26-3required to secure the elimination of classes over40. In secondary schools the prospects are for astaffing ratio in 1972 similar to the present figureof 18-3. The ratio of 15-7 required to securethe elimination of classes over 30 in secondary schools is not likely to be achieved, on currentpolicies and forecasts, during the 1970s.11 Non-teaching costs per pupil in primary and secondary schools are assumed, as in the 1966Survey, to rise at 2J per cent per annum in real terms (the improvement factor).Universities12 The programme takes account initially of the established figure for the last academic year ofthe present quinquennium (1966-67), and is basedthereafter on student numbers increasing steadilytowards the target of 218,000 in 1973-74.Further education13 Between the academic years 1967-68 and1971-72 the total number of students, excludingthose taking recreational courses in the eveningonly, is estimated to increase by 22 per cent from 501,000 to 612,000 (full-time equivalents).As a result of recent measures to secure more intensive use of technical college resources, thenumber of students per teacher is expected torise from 9-8 to 10. For non-teaching costs animprovement factor of 2 per cent is assumed.Other services14 The provision for adult education and the youth service shows a modest annual increase in expenditure over the period, as in the 1966Survey. It is also assumed that there will be some growth over the period in the schoolhealth service, special schools and university andother awards, in the main to meet the growth inthe number of pupils and students.15 In the 1966 Survey it was assumed that theDepartments expenditure on sport would not increase beyond the 1966-67 level. But the1967-68 Estimates show an increase of about per cent to  1-62 million and, in theDepartments view, it is right to allow for asimilar rate of growth in future to  T95 million in 1971-72. The Treasury consider that any increase over 1967-68 is inconsistent with currentpolicy.expenditure to 1970-7116  From 1967-68 onwards, the new forecasts are below those made last year, mainly for thereasons given in paragraph 9. The reduction isabout  30  million both in   1969-70 and in1970-71.1971-7217 The annual rate of increase in expenditure from 1967-68 to 1970-71 is 4-9 per cent. In thefollowing year it rises to 6 per cent mainly becauseof the increase in capital expenditure and non-teaching costs in schools associated with the raising of the school-leaving age.Scotlandcapital expenditure18   The prog shown below:	ramme	assumes	the building starts   million			1967	1968	1969	7970	1971	-68	-69	-70	-71	-72Schools .	260	26-0	260	260	21-6Further					education	8-8	11-8	10-0	10-6	10-2Teacher					training	2-9	1-7	2-6	2-2	2-8Youth service,					etc.   .      . .	1-1	1-2	1-3	1-3	1-5Total	38-8	40-7	39-9	40-1	36-119 The provision for schools allows for popula-tion growth and movement, the raising of theschool-leaving age and some improvement to olderpremises. The increased figures for further education take account of revised estimates of student numbers, the growing demand for coursesat all levels, including the effect of the industrial training Act, 1964, and some improvement and replacement of older buildings. The Treasurybelieve that the provision for further educationgoes beyond current policy and that starts shouldbe some  2 million  3 million less in each ofthe years 1968-69 to 1971-72. The teacher training programme is designed to make provision for theincreased student numbers including those enter-ing the new three-year training courses for menprimary teachers; some provision is also beingmade for in-service training. The expansion inthe youth service sector is mainly on the localauthority side.current expenditureSchools20 The number of pupils is expected to risebetween 1966-67 and 1971-72 by about 12-5 percent, including those retained in schools as aresult of the raising of the school leaving age in1970, and the number of teachers by 12-7 percent. Non-teaching costs are estimated to rise byabout 34 per cent.
Part Three: Detailed Analysis of ProgrammesFurther education21 Between 1967-68 and 1971-72 the numberof students, excluding those taking courses in the evening only, is estimated to increase by 47 percent from 39,225 to 57,675 (full-time equivalents),the number taking advanced full-time andsandwich courses by 34-2 per cent from 5,850to 7,850, and the number of teachers (full-timeequivalents) by 35-3 per cent from 4,445 to6,015. Non-teaching costs (including awards) areassumed to rise by 46 per cent. These rates of increase exceed those estimated by Robbins forfurther education, and the Treasury consider thatthe current provision should be reduced by some 2 million over the four years 1968-69 to 1971-72.Teacher training22 The number of students in colleges ofeducation is assumed to rise from 11,240 to 15,950between 1967-68 and 1971-72, an increase of nearly 42 per cent. The increased output of teachers will be required to help to improve the critical staffing position in the schools.6 Health and Welfare (with Welfare Foods)TABLE other services23 Expenditure under this head is estimated toincrease by just over 20 per cent between 1967-68and 1971-72. The main services covered includeuniversity awards, social and recreational educa-tion and administration. The increase of nearly20 per cent in expenditure on school meals and milk reflects both rising pupil numbers and ahigher uptake over the period.general24 The annual rate of increase in expenditure from 1967-68 to 1970-71 is nearly 6-2 per cent.(Expenditure in 1970-71 is estimated to exceed the comparable 1966 Survey figure (afterrevaluation) by about  1 -1 million mainly becauseof increased capital provision required to meetthe increased demand in the further educationsector.) In the following year, the annual rateof increase is expected to fall to about 4-7 percent mainly because of the decrease in schoolcapital expenditure after the provision has beenmade for the raising of the school leaving age.  million at 1967 Survey prices1967-68       1968-69       1969-70       1970-71       1971-72Domestic capital expenditure england and walesHospitals......	91-9	101-5	110-2	119-2	128-6*Executive Councils   ....	0-5	0-3	0-1	0-1	0-other central services and grants	3-2	3-7	3-6	3-2	3-local health authority services   .	12-8	15-3	16-3	17-1	18-0Local welfare services	15-8	19-6	20-7	22-0	23-2Total England and Wales	124-2	140-4	150-9	161-6	173-scotland					Hospitals ......	130	13-7	14-6	15-6	16-1*Executive Councils   ....	01	 	 	- &apos;	Other central services and grants	.      .        0-7	0-9	0-9	0-9	0-9Local health authority services   .	.      .        0-5	0-5 &apos;	0-5	0-5	0-5Local welfare services	0-8	0-9	0-9	10	1-0Total Scotland   ....	15-1	160	16-9	18-0	18-5Total Great Britain	139-3	156-4	167-8	179-6	192-4her expenditure					england and wales					Hospitals.      .       .      .	734-9	753-8	776-3	803-5	832-0Executive Councils   .      .      .	349-0	357-5	367-6	377-8	387-other central services and grants	11-6	12-8	13-6	14-4	15-local health authority services   .	127-2	135-5	144-4	153-9	164-departmental administration	.      ,         7-9	8 0	8-3	8-7	90Local welfare services	51-2	55-7	60-4	65-5	71-1Welfare foods.....	41-2	41-1	41-8	41-7	42-6Total England and Wales	.    1,323-0	1,364-4	1,412-4	1,465-5	1,522-scotland					Hospitals......	95-7	98-9	102-2	105-9	109-6Executive Councils	38-4	39-3	40-1	41-1	42-other central services and grants	2-9	3-2	3-2	3-3	3-local health authority services   .	101	10-5	11-0	11-6	12-departmental administration	1 -1	11	1-2	1-2	1-local welfare services	3-6	3-9	4-2	4-6	5-0Welfare foods .....	4-7	4-8	4-8	4-8	4-8Total Scotland   .      .      .      .	156-5	161-7	166-7	172-5	178-2Total Great Britain	.    1,479-5	1,526-1	1,579-1	1,638-0	1,700-grand Total     ....	.    1,618-8	1,682-5	1,746-9	1,817-6	1,892-6* See paragraph 3.
general Forecast expenditure in 1970-71 exceeds by 2-7 million the corresponding forecast in the1966 Survey revalued to 1967 Survey prices.This marginal increase is the balance of a largenumber of small increases and decreases due torevised costing of existing policies. The mainchanges are increases of  3-2 million onpharmaceuticals (due to revision of forecasts inthe light of 1966-67 outturn) and of  2-3 million on current expenditure on local health and welfare services (revised forecast following therate support grant negotiations); and reductions of  2-7 million on general medical services(delay in introducing new contract for general practitioners) and of  1-7 million on welfarefoods (reduced forecast increase in the numberof children under five).Hospitals2 The assumption in the programme is thathospital current expenditure in England andWales will grow over the period at ratesbeginning at 2% per cent in 1968-69 (as in 1967-68) and rising to 3 per cent in 1969-70 and34; per cent in 1970-71 and 1971-72. InScotland the rate is 3-L per cent throughout theperiod.3 The basic programme allows for capitalexpenditure of Hospital Boards (excludingpurchase of land and certain other expenses metcentrally) to rise in England and Wales from 85-2 million in 1967-68 to  112-3 million by1970-71: the corresponding figures in Scotlandare  12-1 million and  14-4 million. Thesefigures are consistent with the planning figures which have already been agreed, and on whichthe forecasts included in the 1966 HospitalWhite Papers (Cmnd. 2877 and Cmnd. 3000) were based. The only assumption behind the 1966White Papers was that annual expenditure wouldnot fall below the figures reached by 1970-71.The Health Departments&apos; proposals for 1971-72(asterisked in the table above) are basedon the continuation of existing policies in the sense that expenditure continues to rise by anamount similar to the increase in the immediately preceding years (the percentage rise thus beingsomewhat less). No planning figures have,however, yet been agreed beyond 1970-71. the determination of a planning figure for 1971-72is one of the matters which will fall to besettled in the light of the decisions taken by ministers in the current review of civil expenditure.Executive Council services  4 For the general medical practitioner services,the forecast assumes that the recent decline inthe number of doctors will be halted and thatthere will be a small increase of 550 in thenumber of doctors giving service in GreatBritain during the period to 1971-72. the forecast provides for remuneration of the doctorsin accordance with the new contract, includingdirect reimbursement in respect of rent and ratesarid of ancillary staff; and it is assumed that thiswill result in a substantial increase in the numberof ancillary staff employed. No provision is isgdefor merit awards, which have not yet beenagreed with the medical profession.5 For general dental services, provision is madefor an expected increase of about 250 dentists inGreat Britain and for increasing expenditure-about 2 per cent per annum on practiceorganisation and equipment which is expected tohelp to produce an increase in average output per dentist.6 For the supplementary ophthalmic service,the forecasts assume an annual increase of about150,000 sight-tests (2\ per cent of present numbers)and a consequential increase in the number ofspectacles supplied.7 For the pharmaceutical services, it is assumed that the immediate effect of the removal of charges has already been fully reflected in thecurrent outturn figures, and the forecasts providefor an annual increase in prescribing equivalentto about 4 million prescriptions in each of theyears 1968-69 to 1971-72, reflecting the growth of population and the increased proportion ofelderly people; and for an increase of about 2 per cent per annum in the real cost perprescription as a result of the trend towards more widespread use of modern expensive drugs.Local authority health and welfare services The forecasts for current expenditure on local health and welfare services in 1967-68 and1968-69 are consistent with those accepted asrelevant expenditure during the Rate support grant negotiations, revalued to 1967 Survey prices.In England and Wales, these figures allow for anincrease of about 64; per cent per annum on local health services and about 84-9 per cent perannum on local welfare services (the mainelement being accommodation for the elderly).The forecasts for the remaining years assume a continuing increase of 64- per cent for local health services and 8-]- per cent for local welfare services.9 In Scotland, the figures accepted for rate support Grant were the equivalent of about 4fper cent per annum on local health services and84; per cent on local welfare services and the forecasts provide for continuation of this trend.10 The forecasts of local authority capital investment in local health and welfare servicesassume (apart from the effects of the specialaction taken in 1965 and 1966 which reducedexpenditure by about  10 million) a continuation of the steady increase assumed in the 1966Survey forecasts. Provision is made for work done (mainly on the basis of capital raised byloan) to rise to about  41 million in England andWales. In Scotland, where the range of localauthority responsibility is narrower, thecorresponding forecast is  1-5 million.Welfare foods11 The forecasts are related to the expected increase over the period in the numbers whoqualify.

Changes since then, in particular the widening of the scope of the earnings-related short-term benefits scheme and the introductionof the supplementary benefits scheme (bothintroduced in the autumn of 1966), meant thatin the 1966 Survey there was no room in the basic programme for further improvement. Thefigures for the basic programme in that Reportaccordingly represented the cost of continuing thepresent benefits and keeping the main rates in line with earnings, except for the uprating in1967, which was assumed to take place on1st June and to be Is. less (in terms of the singlerate of retirement pension) than the earningscriterion would have produced in order to recoup part of the cost of the supplementary benefits scheme.2 Since the 1966 Survey, there have been other changes which have important effects on social security benefit expenditure:(i) Earnings-related benefits are now expectedto cost a little less than was forecast atthe time of the 1966 Survey.(ii) The publicity in connection with the supplementary benefit scheme has attracteda larger number of new claims than was expected, and expenditure on the scheme in the early years of the 1967 survey period will be somewhat above what wasforecast for the purposes of the 1966Survey.(iii) It has been decided to defer the 1967uprating from 1st June, 1967, to the endof October 1967. It has also been decidedthat this increase, instead of being basedon the rise in earnings since 1st April,1965, less Is., should be 10s. in cash termson the single person&apos;s rate, or a further5d. below what the expected rise in earnings would justify.(iv) Average earnings to which increases in benefits are related have gone up by less,and are expected to go up by less in thefuture, than was forecast in the 1966Survey.(v) Unemployment throughout the survey period is expected to be considerablyabove the levels forecast for the 1966Survey.(vi) The increase in the number of personsreceiving retirement pension and sickness benefit is now expected to be more than was forecast for the 1966 Survey.The effect on balance of these changes is greatly to reduce the total expenditure on social security benefits compared with what was allowed for inthe 1966 Survey over the comparable period.3 Against this background, the trend of benefitexpenditure has been estimated for the basic programme (at 1967 Survey prices) on thefollowing basis:(a) In order to get the national insurance benefit rates introduced in 1965 (and theother rates which move with them) on to1967 Survey prices they have beenenhanced by 7 -1 per cent, representing theprice increase between 1st April, 1965, and1st April, 1967.(b) It has been assumed that, in accordancewith the Cabinet decision of 15th June,1967, there will be an uprating of 10s.(12-5 per cent) on the standard rate ofnational insurance benefit for a single person at the end of October 1967, and a proportionate increase in most other social security benefits. For the Public Expendi-ture Survey this increase, has been dis-counted to 11-4 per cent to allow for pricemovements between April and October1967, so that of the 12-5 per cent increase,only 4-2 per cent represents a realimprovement.(c) Subsequent increases have been assumednotionally to occur on 1st October, 1969,and 1st October, 1971. (Now that the 1967uprating has been postponed till October,it is thought more realistic to assumebiennial upratings for the time being rather
than to continue with the convention thatthere is a notional uprating on 1st Aprileach year. By assuming upratings midwaythrough estimate years a smooth trend is produced.)(d) The upratings in 1969 and 1971 have been assumed to be in line with an increase in real earnings of 3 per cent per annum fromthe end of October 1967 onwards.(e) The following unemployment assumptionshave been made (registered unemployed)on the basis of the latest forecastsavailable in February 1967 when thefigures were prepared:1967-68 1968-69 1969-70 1970-71 1971-72600,000    600,000    525,000     500,000    500,000(/) Family allowance rates are assumed toremain constant throughout the period.(g) No improvements other than the increasein benefit rates described above have been allowed for in calculating the total.4 Changes in assumptions about the frequency of upratings, the rate of growth of real earnings and the number of recipients have a substantialeffect on the forecasts of expenditure on social security benefits. In particular the unemploymentlevels assumed are higher than the more recentestimates and a change of 50,000 in the annual average of unemployed would alter social securityexpenditure by about  20 million per annum.Thus in 1970-71 the latest assumptions, ascompared to those made for the 1966 Survey,have the following effects (at 1967 Survey prices):  millionBiennial instead of annual upratings       .      -37Reduction in 1967 uprating:Thereafter lower benefits in line withlower growth rate . . . -152Higher unemployment . . . 4-52More children, sick and pensioners .      .       +administration-129+ S-1245 The net increase in the 1970-71 estimate for administration of  5 million is made up 0[increased administrative costs arising from moreunemployed and other beneficiaries and increasesdue to delay in computerisation, partly offset bya contribution of nearly  7 million from SETtowards the cost of its collection as part of the combined National Insurance, etc., flat rate contributions. The costs of collection of thesecontributions are now borne by five services in proportion to the revenue collected for each.The additional costs of collecting SET are much smaller than the share allotted to it in this way.6 Even if there were to be no further change inthe rates of benefit after October 1967, totalexpenditure (including administration costs) forthe social security block would rise from  2,8%million to  3,082 million between 1967-68 and1971-72 mainly because of the increasing numberof retirement pensioners expected to rise from6-6 million to 7-1 million, and of childrenattracting family allowances, expected to rise from6-7 million to 7-6 million.future developments7 No figures are shown for possible additionalprogrammes. These will be considered in the context of the review of civil expenditure. Thereare however two major policy changes at present under consideration in fulfilment of the Govern-menfs 1966 election manifesto pledges.8 The first of these is the introduction of anearnings-related contributory pensions scheme. Itis planned to introduce legislation within the lifetime of the present Parliament, but the scheme could not come into operation before April 1972.9 The second is to introduce measures to alleviate child poverty. The Government has undertaken to announce measures this summer,but at the time of writing for this Report no finaldecision has been made on what these should beor how much they would cost.III.

In August 1965 the Aid programme for 1966-67was fixed by Ministers on a cash basis (i.e., notat constant prices) at  225 million and it wasagreed that the implications of retaining a limit for cash expenditure of  225 million in 1967-68and beyond could be considered again in thefollowing year when the level of the aid programme was reviewed. (The National Plansaid subsequently that the level of the programme would be subsequently reviewed periodically inthe light of the progress made in overcomingour economic problems.) Thus the aid programme was not subject to adjustment forrising costs which would have implied increases of something like  5 million per annum. Theintention to review this decision in the 1966Survey was superseded by the measures announced on 20th July, 1966, to reduceGovernment expenditure overseas, as part ofwhich the 1967-68 figure was reduced to  205million   by   cuts   and   postponements   eachamounting to  10 million. The figure of  225million for each year from 1968-69 included inTable 9 represents an extension of the 1965series up to the year 1971-72, still on a cashbasis. The Treasury have reservations about a figure of  225 million for 1968-69: theirinterpretation of existing policy, following thedecisions reached in 1965 as modified by the July1966 measures, would be that the Aid programme should return from the reduced figure of  205million in 1967-68 to the level of  225 million in 1969-70 through  215 million in 1968-69. TheMinistry of Overseas Development claim that even if this argument were accepted it would stillbe necessary to add a provision for the  10 milliondeferred expenditure referred to above, thusrestoring the figure to  225 million. The ODMconsider that in order to ensure satisfactorycomparability with other programmes a change should now be made to the constant prices basis.10 Other overseas services table 10  million at 1967 Survey prices1967-68	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	1971-	-7280-4	80-5	82-9	82-9	81	931-6	31-6	30-4	30-4	30	7112-0	112-1	113-3	113-3	112	6a. Overseas representation and informationb. Other external relationsTotal.....a. No significant change is forecast in expenditure on overseas representation including expenditure by the Ministry of Public building and Works on buildings. Expenditure on overseas information in 1967-68 will be rather more than 28 million. The level of expenditure in future years will be considered in the light ofSir Harold Beeley&apos;s report on overseas information services. Provisionally, it is forecast at the same level.b. The forecasts in respect of other external relations, including  payments  to  international organisations, are, in general, at the same level as those of the 1966 Survey. A slight increasein multilateral assistance is expected during theperiod under review; and although the mandatehas still to be renewed, provisions have beenmade on the basis that United Nations&apos; peace-keeping operations will continue. These increases are off-set by reduced expenditure in respect of ghana and for police pensions, on theCommonwealth Services Vote.11 Transport (excluding roads and nationalised undertakings)TABLE 11  million at 1967 Survey prices	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72a.

Thiswas in large measure due to the halt in theexpansion of the economy and a consequentialshortfall in freight revenues, mainly on steel, butspread over all traffic with the exception of coal.The experience of the past two years has led theMinistry of Transport to the conclusion thatthe Board&apos;s earlier forecasts were optimisticand that, on the assumption of existing structuresand policies, there is little prospect of any significant reduction in the deficit being achieved.
The forecasts for 1968-69 and later must beregarded as purely illustrative, however, since infact the level of the deficit will be substantiallyaffected by structural and operational changesflowing from the Joint Review of british railways now being undertaken by the Govern-ment and the Board. Work is progressing withthe preparation of long-term revenue forecastswhich will take these changes into account and enable more realistic estimates to be made.b. The Waterways deficit has been assumed tocontinue at  1-5 million a year for the whole period.c. Under the Transport Finances Act, 1966, theMinister of Transport is empowered to make grants to meet the deficits of the london transport Board arising up to the end of 1968.Deficits in the calendar years 1967 and 1968 are estimated at a total of  15 million, giving riseto corresponding grant payments in the Exchequerfinancial years 1967-68 and 1968-69. Thesefigures assume that a fares increase yielding 7 million will be in effect from early 1968. Ithas been assumed that the powers to make grants to meet the Board&apos;s deficit will be renewed (by legislation) and that the amount of deficit in1969-70 and beyond will be  6 million perannum, with net changes in costs of the Boardbeing balanced by fares adjustments.d. This item covers only expenditure on airportsmanaged by the Board of Trade and municipalauthorities, and excludes those under the controlof the British Airports Authority.e. The estimates of investment in ports(excluding those administered by the british transport Docks Board and other nationalisedtransport undertakings) have been prepared bythe Ministry of Transport in the light of informa-tion supplied by Port Authorities and theNational Ports Council. Some relatively smallexpenditure on fisheries ports is also included as is provision for grants to private port operatorsThe cut of  12-5 million imposed last year oiithe forecast expenditure of  44-6 million (exclud-ing fishery ports) in 1967-68 led to a revised estimate of expenditure of  32-1 million. this latter figure has been revised to  35-5 million to allow conversion to 1967 Survey prices, andby extension of the scope of the figures to includeitems, costing  2-5 million, not previouslycovered.  7 million of the cut in expenditure isexpected to be met from an unallocated shortfallof the expenditure currently programmed by the ports, which is considered by the NPC and theMinistry to be in excess of what will actually beachieved. Forecasts of future investment are basedprimarily on the ports&apos; own programmes but over-all adjustments have been made by the Ministryreflecting past experience and their overall viewof the demand for port facilities.The forecasts include expenditure met fromgrants, paid at the rate of 20 per cent underSection 12 of the Harbours Act, 1964, asamended, to assist the improvement of ports(in so far as these grants are estimated to be payable to the non-nationalised ports).f. This includes capital expenditure on road passenger transport by local authorities and grants to road passenger transport operators inrelief of the additional costs arising from theincreased tax on fuel imposed by the Finance(No. 2) Act, 1964, and the current year&apos;s Budget;and certain preliminary work in connection withthe construction of the Channel Tunnel. It doesnot, however, include provision for further expenditure proposed by the Minister ofTransport on road safety, assistance to busoperators, and transport research which couldadd  23 million per annum by 1970-71.Note: Annex 1 brings together in tabular form summarydata on transport.12   Investment GrantsTABLE 12  million at 1967 Survey prices	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72Investment grants (excluding grants to public corporations)	1890	376-0	353-0	333 0	272-0These figures reflect a variety of factors:(i) The assumption that investment in manu-facturing industry will continue to fallduring 1967 and 1968, though at adecreasing rate, but will rise thereafter by5 per cent in each of the two succeedingyears. The forecast for computers and ships is an assessment of the likely trend. -(ii) The temporary increase in the rate of grant from 20 to 25 per cent (40 to 45 per centin Development Areas) on capital expendi-ture incurred in the calendar years 1967and 1968.(iii) The assumption that claims lag behindentitlement in 1967-68, catch up in1968-69, and that the arrears are made up over the following three years. (Butthe figures for any one year may varysubstantially in either direction.)(iv) A gradually reducing time lag betweencapital expenditure by a firm and payments of grant. These figures assume a time lagof 15 months in 1967-68 falling to months in 1970-71. No change has beenmade in the figures to allow for the ministerial decision in June 1967 that thetime lag in 1967-68 will be reduced bya further three months, which will have theeffect of bringing forward into 1967-68expenditures of up to  60 million thatwould otherwise have fallen in later years.Later decisions about the future timing of grant payments will determine when theoffsetting reduction of up to  60 million will occur.

This block brings together all the civil expenditure for which the Ministry of Technology is nowresponsible, following the fusion of the formerMinistry of Aviation with this Department. the items grouped under Government Research and technological Support for Industry comprise that part of the total expenditure which is regardedas programmable&apos; in principle, that is, whichmight provide the basis of an agreed forwardallocation, though such a programme cannot yet be constructed over the whole of this field. TheDepartment envisage a process of survey toestablish what is required in each part of theengineering industry before action can take place;in a year&apos;s time, when the Departments researchpolicy and industrial support programme havereached a firmer stage it should be possible for at least a substantial part of part (1) to be planned within a long-term allocation of resources. The figures in the total of part (1)assume that the current expenditure on government research will remain roughlyconstant, but allow for a continued increase intechnological support for industry on a scale which the Ministry of Technology at presentconsider likely. The total forecast for part (1)items for 1970-71 (i.e.,  122 million) is 5 percent less, at constant prices, than the total ofthe corresponding items in the 1966 Survey.The items in parts (2) and (3) are notpotentially programmable&apos; in a similar sense.They include existing major projects, measures offinancial assistance to industry and financialtransactions, and certain additional aircraft projects which are under discussion, but they donot allow for entirely new proposals ordevelopments of policy which may arise in thefuture.The following notes comment on the main items of expenditure:(!)   Government   research   and   technologicalsupport for industry a.. b. c. Government research. The Departmentaims to deploy its public sector research resources at the former Aviation and Ministry of technology establishments and Atomic energy authority establishments, which employ in totalabout 9,000 qualified scientists and engineers, toprovide the most effective help for industry aswell as discharging its defence responsibilities.It is reviewing its research policy for this purpose.For the Atomic Energy Authority the figurescover expenditure on research and development(other than that shown for major projects inpart (2)k) both in the nuclear and non-nuclearfields (the latter under Section 4 of the science and Technology Act, 1965). They include animputed rental averaging about  9 million perannum. The figures assume that resources notrequired for the nuclear programme will beredeployed on non-nuclear work.d. Support for the engineering industry. Thisconsists of development contracts and other means of enabling producers and consumers of engineering products to take the risks of modernisation:  the policy is as much directed towards the application of advanced techniquesas to the development of advanced projects Themain expenditures in this period are in theindustries originally allocated to the department i:e., computers (both development of newmachines and stimulation of applications, e.?National Computing Centre), electronics&apos; (theproposed new  5 million programme for development of micro-electronics), machine-tools(pre-production orders and development ofnumerically-controlled equipment). some allowance is made for support for the mainengineering and vehicle industries for which theDepartment became responsible last year.e. f. General research and support; NRDC.These are services for improving productivity and encouraging innovation generally, e.g., grants to industrial research associations, the ProductionEngineering Advisory Service, work on standards and support for the British Standards Institution,setting up advanced technological institutes,information dissemination service, action to helpstrengthen the engineering institutions, recruitingto offset the brain drain, development work ina variety of special fields, e.g.. oceanography,hovercraft, air traffic control. The figures foradvances to the National Research development corporation assume that legislation is passed toincrease the present  25 million limit on these advances.g. Headquarters (civil). The headquarters staff is assumed to increase over the period to administer the increasing work on support for industry.a.-g. Aggregate. The total of the figures for theindividual items in part (1) has been reduced byan unallocated shortfall of  6 million in 1970-71to allow for the possibility that, in the light ofthe review of the research programme and of thedevelopment of policy, expenditure on someindividual items may be reduced below thepresent&apos;&apos; forecast. Of this assumed  6 millionshortfall, perhaps  4 million may be in respectof Government Research. A smaller shortfall hasbeen assumed for 1968-69 and 1969-70.The Department believes that these operations for the support of industry will yield an adequatenational economic return, often very quickly.(2)   Major projects and financial assistance toindustryh. Aircraft projects and assistance. The five-year total programme amounts to  384 million of which  201 million has already been approvedby the Treasury; the remaining projects are still under discussion. The principal projects already approved are the Concord development programme, the launching aid for the firstaircraft for BEA re-equipment, and thedevelopment of the RB-207 and 203 engines.Those under discussion include the secondBritish aircraft required for the re-equipment ofBEA in fulfilment of Ministers&apos; declared policy,the proposed European Airbus and Concordproduction. Much of the expenditure onprojects under discussion&apos; is thereforeunavoidable without a reversal of policy; but the
Part Three: Detailed Analysis of ProgrammesTreasury is not committed to the actual figures and, in particular, it is possible that theproduction of Concord might be financed bymeans of bank loans with Governmentguarantees which would be unlikely to lead toany public expenditure as defined in this Surveyduring the period up to 1971-72.i, Space. This expenditure covers participation in ELDO consistent with commitments under-taken at the ELDO Ministerial Conference ofJuly 1966 ( 31 million over five years); the black Arrow programme consistent with theCabinet decision of November 1966; andassociated basic satellite technology research anddevelopment in Government establishments and in industry. The five-year total is  48-1 million.(Apart from this expenditure by the Ministry of technology, provision for scientific space research,including United Kingdom participation in ESRO,is included in Section 16a under the headingResearch Councils (other than Social Science),etc.&apos;)j. Shipbuilding. This represents the reorganisa-tion loans and grants ( 38 million) provided forin the Shipbuilding Industry Bill, designed tobring about a regrouping of the industry intolarger and more efficient units. (The shipcredits, which under the provisions of the bill will be guaranteed by the Government, are to beprovided by the banks and not from theExchequer.)15 Other employment, industry and tradek. sea reactor projects. This is the capitalexpenditure on building major new reactors(other sea R&amp;D expenditure is included inPart (1)). The fast reactor prototype at Dounreayis  30 million of the five-year total of  40million; the rest is - mainly the outstandingexpenditure on the Steam Generating HeavyWater and Advanced Gas Cooled Reactors andthe related design effort.and    other    financial(3)   Share    purchasestransactions1.

Theresult is a minus figure each year because receipts from Defence Votes include substantial, payments in respect of expenditure incurred by the authority in earlier years. The figures include an imputedrental averaging about  20 million a year.TABLE 15			  million at 1967 Survey prices			1967-68	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72a.

This expenditure consists of:(i) the whole of the Vote IV.7 expenditure ofthe Ministry of Labour;(ii) expenditure of local authorities on services grant-aided by the Ministry ofLabour; and(iii) payments out of the Redundancy Fund,administered by the Ministry of Labour,but wholly financed out of contributions paid by employers.I &apos;The main elements in the Vote are theMinistry of Labour&apos;s administrative costs,including the local Employment Exchanges, theGovernment Training Centres and the factory inspectorate and grants and loans towards the youth Employment Service, training and rehabilitation schemes and services for theseriously disabled. This expenditure, togetherwith that of the local authorities, is estimated torise from  43-3 million in 1966-67 to 51;6 million in 1967-68 and  58-4 million in1971-72. This increase is largely accounted forby the approved expansion of government training Centres and the assistance given by wayof loans and grants to the Industrial TrainingBoards.As regards redundancy payments, the fore-casts assume outgoings of  31 million from the redundancy Fund in 1967-68 and  25 million ayear thereafter. This is more than double thelevel assumed last year, based on subsequentexperience of the operation of the scheme. Witha view to meeting the higher figures of payments from the Redundancy Fund the contributions paidby employers have been increased.b. This covers a scheme announced in 1963 tomake available  75 million for loans to ship-owners for the construction of vessels in theUnited Kingdom. Only  17-6 million nowremains to be advanced and this will go to the cunard Company for the Q.4 in 1968-69.Repayments of loans already made range from 5-7 million to  7-4 million per annum over theperiod.
c. This programme consists of loans and grantsby the Board of Trade to firms providing additional employment in the development areas, and the building of factories by the Boardof Trade in the Development Areas for sale orletting. The level of expenditure is governed inpart by the policies pursued and in part by thelevel of demand for these facilities. the forecasts of Vote expenditure assume a substan-tial continued rise because of the use of the wider powers given to the Board of Trade in theIndustrial Development Act, 1966 and resumedeconomic expansion from 1968 onwards. Thisrise is partly offset by increased repayments of loans and by rent receipts, and partly becauseof a dip in expenditure in 1968-69 throughdiscontinuation of Standard grants&apos; for plant and machinery (now subsumed in the separateprogramme of investment grants). nevertheless the figure shown for 1971-72 is close to thecurrent year estimate of about  45 million.The forecasts allow for the further programmeof advance factories approved in principle inApril 1967, but not for changes in the loan andgrant arrangements which were under considera-tion at the same time, nor for any changes in the coverage of the Development Areas.d. The Industrial Reorganisation Corporation(set up in December 1966, with the function of16  Research Councils, etc.TABLE 16stimulating and assisting industrial concentrationrationalisation and development) draws money from two Exchequer sources loans from the consolidated Fund, on which a fixed rate ofinterest is charged, and Exchequer DividendCapital from Votes, on which the rate of returnis not prescribed in advance. There is a statutory limit on the Corporation^ borrowing, the Iaggregate of its borrowing from the consolidate fund and its drawings of Exchequer DividendCapital must not exceed  150 million.The rate at which funds are drawn from theExchequer is dependent upon the number ofschemes taken up by the 1958-59. No firm forecasts Ican be made on this at present. For this report it has been assumed that all the funds will bedrawn by the end of 1970:  36-3 million in1967-68 rising to  60 million in 1968-69 anddeclining thereafter: these figures have been used as a measure of public expenditure by theCorporation.e. This includes Board of Trade assistance towards the promotion of trade and industrial efficiency ( 10-8 million in 1971-72). Thereduction in expenditure in 1970-71 arises fromthe fact that the  26-6 million loan to the aluminium Company of Canada is then due tobe repaid.  million at 1967 Survey prices1967-68       1968-69       1969-70       1970-71      1971-72a.

This forecast covers expenditure by the science, Medical, Agricultural, and NaturalEnvironmental Research Councils, the british museum (Natural History) and grants and services for scientific purposes. Treasury Ministers have approved a three-year expenditure programmebased on declining percentage rates of growth of11 per cent for 1967-68, 10 per cent for 1968-69and 9 per cent for 1969-70. The figures for theyears up to 1969-70 are derived from these growthrates. The figures for 1970-71 and 1971-72 areprovisional pending advice from the Council for scientific Policy on the rates of growth which it considers appropriate for those years.72-6	79-9	87-1	94-1	101-11-2	1-9	3-0	4-1	5-273-8	81-8	90 1	98-2	106-3b. The figures for expenditure on the Social 1Science Research Council are based on a projectedincrease in research grant commitments from 1 million in 1967-68 to  4-2 million in 1971-72.The Department of Education and Science regard this increase as necessary in order to build upthe work of the Council to an effective level ina reasonable time. The Treasury consider that inview of the demand for highly qualified manpower and the need for financial stringency, these commitments should not be allowed to rise above 2-4 million in 1971-72 and that expenditure should be correspondingly reduced.17   Agriculture, etc.TABLE 17			  million	at 1967 Survey prices		1967-68	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	i97i-n(&quot;Other assistance to agriculture b. -\ Fisheries     ...... ^Forestry......	285-3 48-1 .      .         6-5 33-8	290 0 50-9 7-1 36-6	290-0 53-2 5-9 38-8	290-0 53-4 5-5 41-4	290-0 54-4 5-2 44-2Total   .      .      .      .	.      .      373-7	384-6	387-9	390-3	393-8;
lt it is a Survey convention that the latest estimate of the cost of agricultural support in thecurrent year is taken as the forecast of the cost inthe later years covered by the Survey. This is because the cost of agricultural support is affectedby changes in the level of supplies and in market prices which cannot be forecast with any reason-able degree of accuracy; nor is it possible to forecast the nature or effect of changes whichmay be made at future Annual Reviews. Inthese circumstances, the only practicable course is to assume forecast figures for agricultural support of the same order as the 1967-68Estimate, adjusted to take account both of theconclusions of the 1967 Annual Review and also of proposals in the Agriculture Bill for new expenditure on improving the structural efficiency of agriculture and for encouraging investment in it.b. Estimated expenditure on these items covers a variety of agricultural and horticultural servicesnot included in agricultural support, together withthe cost of Exchequer assistance to forestry andthe fishing industry.

Part Three: Detailed Analysis of ProgrammesDOMESTIC CAPITAL EXPENDITURE]be forecasts  for  water reflect  the growing demand of industry, agriculture and the domesticconsumer and the cost of the large schemesrequired to meet this demand. Capital expendituresewerage is expected to increase because ofthe need to cope inter alia with the risingconsumption  of  water  and  the  increase  indifficult trade effluents requiring treatment. Theincrease in expenditure on refuse disposal is duethe need for large new disposal plants inLondon and Glasgow and for improved vehiclesequipment. Other public health expenditureshows  an   increase  partly   because   of   thecentralisation of depots by London boroughs andly because of a continued increase in cleanair grants arising from greater local authorityactivity with more areas covered by smoke controlorders. The forecasts of expenditure- on parks,pleasure grounds and baths and on planning and miscellaneous services reflect the cuts which weremade for 1967-68: although in subsequent years the figures are larger, it is assumed that somerestriction  on  the  level  of  expenditure  willcontinue throughout the period to 1971-72. Asubstantial  increase in   1968-69  in planningexpenditure (mainly for land acquisition) is basedon a reassessment of local authority proposals;and will be partly offset by a more gradualeasing of restrictions on miscellaneous services:h include  offices,  private  street works,cemeteries, crematoria, markets  and theatres).The increase over the 1966 Report forecast forScotland is largely attributable to the inclusion ofexpenditure on arts centres, previously omitted from the Survey.other expenditure the estimates of other expenditure (excludingdepartmental administration) in 1967-68 and1968-69 are based on the more up-to-date figures which were submitted by local authorities last autumn for the Rate Support Grant exercise.For subsequent years the forecasts assume that local authority expenditure will continue toincrease at the same rate as in recent years-i.e.,at just over 6 per cent a year in England and in wales, and at about 4  per cent a year in Scotland.The bulk of these increases is attributable to loan charges on the capital expenditure programme and much of the rest will be taken up by increases in running costs of the new capital works andacquisitions. The Great Britain totals are there-fore much larger than the estimates shown in the1966 Report: by about  40 million in 1967-68rising to about  70 million in 1970-71.In reaching decisions last December on thelevel of expenditure which could be accepted forthe purposes of the Rate Support grant negotiations, substantial reductions were made inthe estimates submitted by local authorities. TheMinistry of Housing and the Welsh Office do notconsider that all the reduction that was nominallyassigned to local environmental services inEngland and Wales will be achieved on these services. They estimate that the amounts of the cuts on these services which are unlikely to berealised are about  14 million in 1967-68 and 11 million in 1968-69; and the 1967 Reportfigures are therefore correspondingly higher thanthe estimates approved for Rate Support Grantpurposes.19 Libraries, Museums and ArtsTABLE 19			  million at 1967 Survey prices			1967-68	1968-69	1969-70	7970-7/	1971-72a.

Estimates of local authority current expendi-ture on public libraries and museums accepted for Rate Support Grant were about  4 million(10 per cent) above the revalued 1966 Surveyforecasts for both 1967-68 and 1968-69. For therest of the forecast period, a rate of increase aboutequal to that between 1967-68 and 1968-69 is assumed. Forecasts of capital expenditure are based on an increase in loan sanctions from-7 million in 1966-67 to  8-4 million in thefour following years and to  10-5 million in1971-72. Loan sanctions on this scale wouldenable local authorities to carry out the mostunportant projects they are likely to put forward,lower figures suggested by the Treasury for bothcapital  and  current  expenditure   are   underconsideration in the civil review, where locallibraries and museums are being examinedtogether with education.b. The figures for the national museums and institutions show the cost of continuing existing policies, and the annual increases provided forrelate only to staff and administrative expenses.c. The figures included in respect of the Arts,although reflecting a continuation of the policiesdescribed in the White Paper, Tolicy for the arts&apos;, are provisional. The arrangements forforward financing of the Arts are now under examination, and the figures for the period up to1971-72 will probably have to be adjusted in thelight of these discussions.

The estimatesprovide for an increase in uniformed strengthsfrom 87,500 to 102,000 (17 per cent) and in civilian staffs, including traffic wardens, cadetsand school crossing patrols, from 37,485 to56,645 (51 per cent).b.   PRISONSCapital expenditure on prison building is forecast to rise from the Budget Estimate of  5 million in 1967-68 to  16-7 million in 1970-71 and 18-2 million in 1971-72, compared with a forecast rise to  9-1 million in 1970-71 whichwas shown in last year&apos;s Survey revalued. Thishigher forecast represents the minimum which theHome Office consider is required to accommodate the higher number of prisoners now forecast andto implement the Mountbatten recommendations.Approval has already been given to capitalexpenditure in 1967-68 (additional to the BudgetEstimate figure shown in the table) of  2-5 million on security measures and additional accommodation, but the scale and phasing of the
21 Child CareTABLE 21e. prisonsCapital expenditure will rise from  0-8 million to  2-4 million. Current expenditure on prisonsis expected to rise from  2-6 million to 3-0 million (15-4 per cent) in the period. Themain assumptions are that (a) the penalpopulation will increase from about 3,850 in1967-68 to 4,600 (19-48 per cent) in 1969-70 and later years; (b) the building programme (including expenditure on new institutions borne on theMinistry of Public Building and Works Vote)will improve existing accommodation as well as providing new establishments and (c) prison staff will increase by 2T3 per cent mainly to fill posts in new establishments expected to be completed by the end of the period.f. fire services in Scotland the increase over the same period is17-5 per cent, and allows for an increase ofabout 90 per annum in operational strengths andfor an increase in civilian staff.Great Britaing.    parliament and law courts, etc.The cost of maintaining Parliament and the privy council is expected to remain constant; theestimates provide for an increase in expenditureof 17-9 per cent on judicial and related servicesover the period 1967-68 to 1971-72. (the expected increase in income from fines, etc., is25 - 6 per cent.) Provision is made for the numberof probation officers to increase from 2,700 to3,500 in 1971-72. The number of applicationsreceived by the Criminal Injuries CompensationBoard is expected to rise from 3,600 to 6,000 bythe end of the period and the number of criminal cases in the higher courts in which legal aid is granted is expected to rise from 29,000 to 38,000.  million at 1967 Survey prices1967-68       1968-69       1969-70       1970-71       1971-72a.

The.number of field officers is forecast to rise from .900 to 4,300 over the same period. The forecastalso provides for an increase in the output of trained officers to 615 per annum from 1969-70onwards compared with 375 in 1967-68; and fora new shortened training course introduced as anemergency measure to produce a further 100trained officers per annum in 1968-69, 1969-70and 1970-71.b. For Scotland, the forecasts are consistent withthe figures submitted last year. Expenditure isexpected to increase by 13-6 per cent from1967-68 to 1971-72.expenditure in subsequent years has not yet beenaccepted by the Treasury, pending the outcome of the general review of public expenditure.The increase in capital expenditure over the1966 Survey revalued, comprises:1968-69    1969-70    1970-71Additionalaccommodation       1-4 1-5 6-5Mountbatten.      .      .2-4 0-8 0-other .     -      -      -       0-9 1-1 0-9Current expenditure on prisons is expected toincrease by 37-5 per cent over the period.

FIRE SERVICESExpenditure in England and Wales is forecast torise by 20-5 per cent between 1967-68 and1971-72, due largely to an expected increase inoperational strengths rising to 800 per annum by1969-70, to fill existing vacancies and to cope with basic developments of the service, withproportionate increases in the supporting civilianstaff.Scotlandd.  police the forecasts provide for expenditure on police to grow by 13-1 per cent over the period andcover an increase in uniformed strengths from about 10,500 to 11,400 and in civilian strengthsfrom 2,058 to 2.455.

SECRETPart Three: Detailed Analysis of Programmesa. This item covers capital expenditure by theMinistry of Public Building and Works on buildings and on furniture and equipment. Mostof this is for offices, but there are also other elements, including science and research buildings,museums and arts buildings, and government training Centres. Expenditure is forecast toincrease by 50 per cent over the period 1967-68to 1971-72. The figures for the three middle yearsof the Survey period show substantial increasesover the 1966 Survey revalued (18 per cent in1968-69, 29 per cent in 1969-70, and 28 per centin 1970-71). This is due to the large number of fresh demands for new buildings which are beingmade on the Ministry (for instance, expenditureon new computer centres in 1970-71 is estimatedat  5-8 million).b. The figures show the net charge on the stationery Office vote for the aggregate of demands from numerous Government Depart-ments and for the Stationery Office&apos;s own costs of meeting them. The rising trend over the review period reflects growing modernisation of office procedures, e.g., by computers andreproduction machines, and a marked expansion in the volume of Government business requiring the use of paper, printing, binding, etc.The increase over the 1966 Survey figures forthe four years 1967-68 to 1970-71 (total of  18-5 million at constant prices) are attributable mainly to revised assessments of the incidence ofpayments on large machinery projects and of the trend of demand for goods and services.c. This covers a variety of expenditures,including expenditure by the Ministry of public building and Works on rents and on themaintenance of Government buildings, part ofthe expenditure of the Central Office ofInformation, payments in lieu of rates forGovernment property and expenditure on civilsuperannuation.d. A global sum is offset for Allied Services(Defence) which item appears in Table 2, in theSection on other military defence.25 MiscellaneousTABLE 25  million at 1967 Survey prices	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70	1970-	-71	1971-72a.

SECRETPart Four s Methodologypart four: methodologyDefinition off expenditure[n order that the figures of public expenditureset out in this Report can be fitted in as far aspossible with the statistics and forecasts of national income and expenditure, they have to be measuredin accordance with the methods, sources anddefinitions used by the Central Statistical Officejn compiling the accounts of the public sectorwithin the overall framework of the national accounts. Public expenditure is defined as coveringcurrent and capital outlays of the CentralGovernment (including the gross outgoings of theNational Insurance Funds) and local authorities,together with the capital expenditure of public corporations. Transfer payments outside thepublic sector are included but internal transferscentral government grants to the national insurance Funds and to local authorities) areeliminated. Debt interest is excluded throughout(but see paragraph 8 below).2 The composition of total public expenditurein terms of economic categories by calendar year&apos;s  set out in Table 53 of the 1966 Blue Bookon National Income and Expenditure togetherwith the receipts of the public sector which finance the expenditure. At the back of the 1966 Blue)k there is a table providing figures of pastexpenditure by financial year, consistent withthose in the body of the Blue Book, classified byfunction in the way used for previous Surveysof future expenditure. The figures in this Reporthave been compiled in a comparable manner, at constant prices as defined below. There have,however, been some changes in classification andcoverage from the 1966 Blue Book which willbe reflected in the published statistics in due course. Among these, since the 1966 Survey, the coverage of public expenditure has been enlargedto include cash expenditure on the net acquisitionof company securities, and the (revalued) 1966Survey figures in this Report reflect the change.Price basis3 Figures for current expenditure on goods and services are on a similar price basis to the1967-68 Estimates. Those for expenditure on fixed assets are mostly at March 1967 prices. In somerases, however, e.g., roads and education, they relate to the price basis currently in use for planning purposes, which may differ from March1967. Payments such as grants and loans to industry, school meals and milk (regarded ascurrent grants to the personal sector) andscholarship awards, which do not involve thefeet purchase of goods and services, aremeasured in terms either of early 1967 prices or the price basis used in the 1967-68 Estimatesas appropriate; no allowance is made for antici-pated future price rises.4 Subsidies, family allowances and the aid programme are expressed in money terms, i.e.,(he amount expected to be disbursed in each year,irrespective of price changes which may by then have occurred. Although the effect of this treat-ment is to overstate the demands on resources which such money expenditures would make,there is nothing in the change in the amount ofmoney being provided from year to year that can be specifically attributed to the effect of price changes. As described in Part Three, Section 17a,the estimates for agricultural subsidies are necessarily notional.5 The method of estimating the figures for social security benefits is described in detail inSection 7 of Part Three. The effect of thistreatment is to show the year to year change in expenditure from 1967-68 onwards, if there is removed from the assumed successive changes in rates of benefit the element attributable to price changes.6 Figures on the basis just described are referredto as &apos;at 1967 Survey prices&apos;. With the exceptionof those items treated as in paragraph 4 above,this price basis is in general appropriate forcomparing demands on resources made by public expenditure in successive years, and for relatingthe growth of the total to what is tolerable inthe light of growth of domestic product. It isnot appropriate for the assessment of taximplications. For this purpose an estimate has tobe made of the effect of future price changeson the amount of money needed.7 The definition of Constant prices&apos; used in thisReport means that no account is taken of possibleincreases in wages and salaries beyond somealready agreed for 1967-68 and reflected in the1967-68 Estimates, regardless of whether such increases are contemplated merely to keep pace with the rise in living costs, or to keep the recipients&apos; incomes at the same relative levelcompared with other wage and salary earners,or to improve their relative position (in order, forexample, to promote recruitment). Althoughproposals for increases of the last kind do not affect expenditure as measured at constant prices,from the point of view of financing the resultantincreases in costs are as significant as those required by the expansion of the public services.Such increases involve a higher proportion of the gross domestic product being taken by the public sector and carry an implication for taxation.Imputed rent8 To accord with national accounting definitions,the figures of current expenditure include, in somecases, an allowance for what is called imputedrent&apos; to measure the value of the use made of publicly-owned fixed capital assets in the provisionof public services. These assets are treated as partof the resources available to the economy, whetheror not they yield a monetary return, and theuse of them is treated as part of expenditureon the national product just as much as the useof fixed assets for which a cash rent has to bepaid. The method of estimating &apos;imputed rent&apos;where relevant is not uniform for all programmes;
for example, loan charges are used as a measureof Imputed rent&apos; over large areas of localauthority expenditure.Estimates for 1967-689 The figures for 1967-68 included in thisReport, in so far as they relate to Vote-borneexpenditure either directly (in the case of CentralGovernment expenditure) or indirectly (in thecase, for example, of local authorities&apos; current expenditure financed by Central government grants) agree in general with those in the 1967-68Estimates. In some instances, however, account has been taken of important changes since theEstimates, such as the consequences of the 1967agricultural price review and the new price basisof roads expenditure, and of decisions not reflected in the Estimates, such as that to increase therates of social security payments during 1967-68.SET payments10 Payments of selective employment tax bythe Central Government in respect of its ownemployees are included in the figures shown for individual programmes in the Report. It has notbeen possible to allocate similar payments bylocal authorities in this way; accordingly, for thepurpose of this year&apos;s Report these payments are shown in total only under Adjustments&apos; inPart Three, Table 26.
