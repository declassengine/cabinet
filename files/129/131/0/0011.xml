ROAD SAFETY-A FRESH APPROACHSection 1.  INTRODUCTION-THE ROAD ACCIDENT PROBLEM1. Almost 8,000 people were killed on the roads last year, nearly100,000 seriously injured and nearly 285,000 slightly injured. Since 1945,no less than 124,000 people have been killed on the roads and no less than,385,000 have been seriously injured.2. The figures have levelled out in the last three years, ending the longcontinuous rise that stretches back to 1945. Over those 20 years the numberof casualties had risen annually by 5 per cent on average, whereas the volumeof motor traffic had increased by 8 per cent a year. But any hopes thattravel on the roads is getting safer are quite mistaken. We know whycasualties have risen more slowly than the use of vehicles. The main reasonis that people have been using two-wheelers less and less in recent years.The average rider of a bicycle, moped, scooter or motor-cycle is much more likely to have an accident, and to involve someone else in one, than arepedestrians or those who drive or ride in four-wheeled vehicles. It is all to the good that people increasingly prefer the safer types of vehicles to theless safe. But this change cannot go on for ever. As the use of two-wheelersstops declining, the annual accident figures will tend to rise again and torise more steeply.3. If present trends continue we can expect to see half a millioncasualties in 1970. As many people would die on the roads in the next10 years as the entire population of Doncaster, and as many would be seriously injured in road accidents as all the people in Birmingham. If thetrends of the last 20 years are allowed to go on, by the end of thecentury a million people would be hurt on our roads in a single year and20,000 people killed. Even at present rates, more than half the childrenborn this year would be injured in a road accident, sooner or later. One in50 would lose his life on the roads.4. These are appalling figures. We cannot tolerate the unnecessarypain and bereavement and human waste that road accidents make peopleendure. Nor can we shoulder with equanimity the heavy economic burdenthey impose: death and injury deprive the nation of productive output, add to the costs of medical treatment, occupy the time of the police and thecourts; the costs attributable to road deaths and road injuries amount nowto  250 million a year quite apart from the suffering and grief they cause.This is about the cost of 10 new hospitals. At the end of the decade, the bill could be  275 million, and by the end of the century  550 million a year.5. That is the outlook if we do nothing about it. But we know, too,that accident rates can be lowered and that the consequences of accidentscan be made less severe. We must keep the totals down and workceaselessly to reduce them. This will not be easy in face of a rapid and continuing growth in the use of vehicles.   The Government intends to
tackle the problem urgently but at the same time methodically andconsistently.  This will be done:  by making sure that planning to deal with the problem is as clear-headed and scientific in its approach as it can be (Section 2);  by strengthening the organisation to plan and co-ordinate effective action (Section 3);  by educating people in the safe use of the roads, by improvingvehicles and by making the road-users&apos; environment safer (Section 4).We must apply what we already know directly, simply and objectively. Atthe same time, through research and experiment on those aspects where thegreatest dividends can be gained, we must prepare the basis for a. planned,continuing and co-ordinated attack.Section 2.  THE SCIENTIFIC APPROACH6. Each of us is involved in a road accident rarely on average onlyonce in every 300,000 miles we travel and we seldom even see onehappening. As a, result, people are apt to think that accidents happen to others, not to themselves. When they have to think about them, they think of the few they have personally experienced or heard about. They tend,too, to think of remedies which might have helped prevent these particularaccidents. But for a serious assault on the road safety problem we cannotrely on haphazard observations or hunches. Instead, our approach mustbe to find out the facts, and then to seek out and apply effective remedies.Finding the facts7. The planning of road safety measures must start from the facts. Thefirst task is to pick out the main trends and problem areas. If we try tofind out why a particular accident occurred, we can seldom pinpoint a singlecause. Nearly always, it might have been prevented if any one of a variety of things about the road, the vehicles, or the people involved had beendifferent. Accidents arise from an immense range and diversity ofcontributing factors and there is no panacea in road safety. To track downuseful counter-measures, we must collect the simple facts about every accidentand identify the conditions under which accidents are more frequent. Everytime someone is hurt on the roads, the police make a report in standard form.It tells when and where the accident has happened, and to whom; whatvehicles were involved, what manoeuvres they were making and so on.8. The summary figures for the country are published by the Ministry ofTransport every year in a detailed report. The underlying figures are the primary source of knowledge about the factors associated with accidents.This system of data collection makes it possible to monitor and explore thereasons for road accidents and the conditions under which they occur. Thefigures for past years are stored in the Road Research Laboratory&apos;s computer,so that a long and consistent run of detailed information is available forthe close investigation of any single factor or conjunction of factors that isreported.8006b* 2
9. Police reports can also be a starting point for local accidentinvestigations. Some police forces, some local authorities, and the Ministry&apos;stwo Area Road Safety Units classify the facts from them and plot theinformation on maps. They can show what kind of accidents are happeningand where. Unsuspected trouble spots soon show up. Once the local patternshave been identified, the underlying reasons can be sought out.Deciding what to do10. The second stage, nationally and locally, is to look for counter-measures. There is a wide range of possibilities: legislation, regulation andthe enforcement of traffic rules; training and education; better road layoutand maintenance; improvements in the design, equipment and upkeep of vehicles. Some of these can only be applied nationally; some, by their verynature, must be evaluated from local knowledge. Work done in the pastby the Road Research Laboratory, and by others in this country and abroad,provides a great body of knowledge about the factors that affect safety onthe roads. Accident analyses, field surveys, experiments, theoretical studiesand growing experience from local road safety efforts have shown what canbe done about many accident problems and how effective different counter-measures are likely to be. As new problem areas are identified, new linesof research are pursued.11. As well as the effectiveness of counter-measures, we must also consider their costs. Resources are limited. We must choose those lines ofaction which bring the best results. To help in this, the Ministry ofTransport is developing an application of cost-effectiveness analysis, as a guide to priorities in road safety. This technique sets against the numberof fatal and serious injuries that a measure would save an estimate in money terms of the human effort and physical resources it would require. TheMinistry of Transport^ studies on these lines are still in their early stages.And the technique has its limitations: thus there are bound to beuncertainties in estimating the casualty saving a measure can achieve; forsome particularly for highway works the range of casualty savings varieswidely from case to case; the cost estimates may also have to be only verybroad; and the scope for a given measure may be limited, so that the answerwill change as the most favourable cases are tackled&quot;, and only less favourablecases remain to be dealt with.12. Despite these limitations the preliminary results encourage theMinistry to believe that this style of quantitative analysis will pay highdividends in the choice of lines of action in road safety, and the ministry will be developing the technique as well as developing its action programme in the light of the results. It already enables us to make some comparisonsin relative terms, and to assess their value at least to the right order of magnitude. It indicates for example that to require those who have passed the driving test to display a special plate on their vehicles during aprobationary period, and to sit a further test at the end of it would cost the community at least 30 times as much for each death or serious injuryit saved as would, for instance, new street lighting on a busy road in abuilt up area; again, the improvement of sight-lines at carefully chosen ruraljunctions can be expected to save rather more casualties for a given
expenditure than a requirement for protective guards on goods vehicles:though this too is a promising possibility and would do far more to preventaccidents than, for example, compulsory medical tests for elderly drivers.By applying cost-effective analysis we can select the measures on which to concentrate first. Thus we can give the highest priority as we have done to a nation-wide programme of improvements to the running surface of roadsat bends and skid-sites. Equally we can rule out of court many measures,which may be ardently advocated, that would impose costs out of all proportion to the practical help they can give.13. The proposals for action made in Section 4 are based on the established findings of research and, where possible, on an analysis of their cost and effectiveness. The programme also includes measures which must beexperimental at present and cannot be properly evaluated without field trials.It would be wrong to leave these untried because their effectiveness cannotbe conclusively tested off the roads. But even those measures v/hose valuealready seems certain will be kept under review and the results will be sentback for appraisal, to complete the testing cycle: first, exploratory analysis;second, specific research and evaluation; third, action or field experiment;fourth, re-appraisal, and, if necessary, further research or modified action. Inthis way, by exploration, research and evaluation the Government will maintain a continuing programme of action based not on supposition but onthe facts.Section 3.   STRENGTHENING THE ORGANISATION14. Road safety is not a subject on its own it is an aspect of roadbuilding, traffic management, environmental planning, law enforcement,education and publicity. Six government departments and many localauthorities, transport industries, vehicle manufacturers and voluntary workersall play a part in it. Although they have done good work, they have achieved less than they might, because there has been too little co-ordinationof effort and no clear strategy. The simple answers to accident problemshave been too often ignored, just because there has seldom been anyonein a position to identify the factors thoroughly. Choose the best line ofaction and put it into effect. Just as we need a clearer approach on research and the evaluation of measures, so we need a better organisation to make sure that our attack on road safety is more systematic, betterco-ordinated and more knowledgeable.The Central Road Safety Unit15. The Government is focusing its efforts on road safety in a newCentral Road Safety Unit within the Ministry of Transport. This unit will bring together a team of varied experience and will be the main link withthe whole range of people working in road safety. It will develop and carry through the continuing programme of national road safety measures and give fresh impetus to local efforts, guiding, stimulating and informing them. It will be the channel through which local problems can be referred back for central study, research and resolution. In short, it will be thedriving force in getting things done in road safety.
16. The new Unit will work with the other organisations in road safety,rather than replace them. The National Road Safety Advisory council will balance the new emphasis on science and professionalism by informedlay opinion. In particular, it will advise on problems of human behaviour.And much necessary local action will still be possible only because of the enthusiasm of voluntary workers. Government departments have enjoyeda special relationship with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidentsand discussions have now begun on the development of this co-operation for the future, particularly in the organisation of training and publicitywhere the Society has useful experience to offer. The unit will also be intouch with trade unions and trade associations, and with organisationsrepresenting motorists and other road users.Area Road Safety Units17. Area Road Safety Units were set up in 1963 in Hampshire andWarwickshire to study the facts about local accidents, to devise remedies,and, with the local authorities, to promote action on them. Their work was experimental at first, and their staffs have remained small. But theyhave demonstrated how accident reports can be used to diagnose and remedylocal accident problems. On a twenty-one-mile stretch of A.45, the numberof accidents in which people were hurt fell from 301 in 1964 to 252 in1966 a 16 per cent reduction after this treatment. The solutions maybe unspectacular things like small changes in the layout of junctions, or new arrangements to shepherd children to school but they strike at theproblems where and when they occur.18. The techniques these units have developed must be applied more widely, particularly in the urban areas. The Government will pass on toall local authorities the experience that has been gained. The first two units will be expanded, and three new units will be set up in North-East England,North-West England and the West Riding of Yorkshire. The Secretaries ofState for Scotland and for Wales also propose to set up units. All these units will continue to investigate local accident patterns. But they will also adviselocal authorities on how they can identify and tackle their local problems for themselves. The Government is discussing with&quot; the authorities responsiblefor traffic in London what arrangements will be most appropriate there and will make proposals later to authorities in other urban areas.Local Authorities and Road Safety Officers19. The Government believes that the time has come for all majorlocal authorities to review their road safety arrangements. At present onlyone local authority in three employs a full-time road safety officer. Thisis clearly inadequate. The Government believes that all major authorities,and, in particular, urban authorities with over 100,000 inhabitants, shouldemploy full-time road safety officers.20. At present most road safety officers limit their activities toeducational and training measures. These are most useful and theGovernment intends that they should be expanded and improved wherever possible. But the situation now requires that local road safety activitiesshould be widened and focused more effectively.   The appropriate local
authority committee and its road safely officer could apply the kind of localinvestigation developed by the Area Road Safety Units. In this way thefacts of all accidents involving death or personal injury would be recorded and studied for the measures which can be taken; for example, local trafficregulations, minor works, local publicity and information. By undertakingsuch work in addition to a full range of duties in connection with training,educational and publicity measures, the road safety officer would be in aposition to plan and guide local strategy in dealing with accident problems.The Government would expect him to have pay and status properlycommensurate with his wider range of responsibilities.21. The Government recognises that these proposals will need to be worked out with the local authorities. Solutions must fit in with newconcepts of organisation and management in local government. They mustsuit local circumstances. Special arrangements will be needed for collaboration between smaller authorities. The Government will discuss with local authorities how best the objectives for strengthening their road safety efforts can be achieved.22. Many local accident problems are remedied by alterations in thelayout or use of roads. Recent changes have strengthened local authorities&apos;initiative and discretion as highway authorities and traffic authorities. TheMinister of Transport has stated that local authorities should prepare trafficplans for every major town or city, and they will be given guidance in thepreparation of these plans later in the year. The recent changes in statutoryand financial arrangements (which are described in paragraph 51) have also given local highway authorities wider scope for initiative and more equitablefinancial aid. The Government proposes to give local authorities a greaterdiscretion in this placing of pedestrian crossings. It will introduce legislation in the next Transport Bill to extend their powers to make traffic regulationorders, including those that involve one-way schemes, restrictions on turningmovements and the making of speed limits on minor roads.23. The Government is convinced that through a stronger central organisation, through reinforced Area Road Safety Units and through an intensification of local authority activity on evgry front, we can exploitfully and continuingly the available knowledge and experience of roadaccident prevention.Section 4.   PEOPLE, VEHICLES AND ROADS24.   Using the approach and techniques described earlier in this paper the Government has built up a programme of action on three main fronts:people, vehicles and the road environment.People25. If we are to help people to use the roads more safely, we havefirst of all to persuade them that their own behaviour on the road can bea factor in reducing the number of accidents. This applies to the pedestriancrossing the road as well as to the motor cyclist or the driver of ahigh-performance car.   The internal combustion engine has added a new
flexibility to our system of communications. It has also transformed oursocial life. It probably brings more forms of pleasure within reach ofmore people than any other development of the twentieth century. At thesame time it demands new standards of responsibility, if these gains arenot to be thrown away in pain and loss. Just because the opportunityis so great we must induce sane social attitudes to the problems the motor car creates. We have to bring home to each and every road userthe fact that anyone who has not learned to use the road safely is notequipped for modern life.Informing all road users26. The Government are proposing to run over the next three years a fully integrated programme of public information and publicity. It will cover the widest possible front and use all the appropriate media of masscommunication.   It will have three main objectives:(a) to increase the road user&apos;s knowledge of particular hazards, how they arise and how he can cope with them;(b) to induce a more positive attitude to road safety; and(c) to alter the road user&apos;s behaviour so that he does not put himselfor others at risk.The programme will seek to achieve these long-term objectives through a continuing campaign which will link together publicity on a series of subjects each important in its own right. The results of each phase in the campaign will be tested by social surveys, and we shall adapt the programme in response to the reactions we get as we go on.27. One important subject on which public education is needed, is thefitting and use of seat-belts. These reduce fatal and serious casualties to people in the front seats of cars by 70 per cent. They are now compulsoryon new cars and light vans, but only a quarter of the cars and light vansnow on the roads have been fitted with them so far. And only 40 per cent of those who have scat-belts wear them. If everyone in the front seat of acar or van always wore a seat-belt, we should save 43,000 fatal and seriouscasualties this year.  At present, seat-belts are saving 3,500.28. Drink and driving is another field where public education is urgently required. There is good reason to believe that publicity over the past threeyears has helped to achieve a change in attitudes. After the Ministry&apos;sdrink and driving campaign of 1964 there were between 10 and 15 per centfewer casualties over Christmas than would have been expected if there hadbeen no campaign. Public opinion now strongly supports the creation of thenew offence of driving with more than 80 milligrammes of alcohol per100 millilitres of blood under the Road Safety Act, 1967. The Ministryestimates that the new provisions will save between 400 and 720 deaths ayear, and between 5,000 and 9,000 serious injuries. But the motorist mustbe helped to adjust to the new situation. Before the law comes into forcetherefore the Ministry will conduct a campaign of public information so thatthe driver knows what the law is, how. it will work and how it will affect him personally.
Training new road-users29. Education on this broad front must be reinforced by the higheststandards of training for those who are new road users: children, learnerdrivers and learner motor cyclists. We expect full advantage to be taken of the opportunities for road safety training in schools. The new generationmust be taught road safety from the start. As they grow up they mustlearn the lessons they are going to have to apply day by day on the roads.They must acquire knowledge, habits and attitudes which will stand themin good stead when they themselves come to drive. Parents must play their full part. Much good work has been done by the Royal Society forthe Prevention of Accidents in developing Tufty Clubs and the NationalCycling Proficiency Scheme. Instruction at school carries special weight. Itis the job of road safety officers to give all the help they can in order thatroad safety education is as good as it can be.30. The Government proposes special measures to raise the standard of driving instruction.(a) The Ministry of Transport will for the first time issue an officialdriving manual. It will describe the best techniques, and standardisedriving procedures. This will reduce the uncertainty and confusionwhich arises at present from the differing ways in which driversexecute their manoeuvres and signal their intentions. The manualwill be published early next year.(b) The Ministry will be producing a number of short films, for showingon television, which will deal with specific driving situations. Likethe manual, these will be aimed at the experienced driver as well asthe learner.(c) The Ministry will publish a new edition of the Highway Code.(d) To raise the standard of driving instruction, the Ministry set up a register of approved professional driving instructors in 1964. So far,it has worked on a voluntary basis. If Parliament approves the road traffic (Driving Instruction) Bill it will become illegal for an instructorto give tuition commercially unless he has qualified for inclusion inthe register.(e) The register and the manual will enable the Ministry to see that allprofessional instructors teach approved procedures and attain high standards. The Ministry will introduce a comprehensive system ofcheck testing of driving instructors, and will visit instructors on the job to help them keep abreast of the best modern techniques.31. The inclusion of driving tuition in the school curriculum began in the United States and there are some similar developments here.In some, arrangements are made with commercial driving schools to trainboys and girls who are old enough to hold provisional licences. In others,where training is given off the public roads, younger children are included.So far this type of training has been largely experimental, and we must make sure that it is beneficial and effective. The Government are thereforearranging with others who have helped in existing training schemes, to makeadvice and help based on existing knowledge available to any school whichwishes to introduce driver training.   But the Ministry of Transport is also
making an urgent study, again with the help of others with experience and knowledge, to assess the effectiveness of the present arrangements fororganised teaching of driving for young people, to consider whether an expansion of these arrangements is justified and practicable, and how this might best be set in hand.The law and law enforcement32. Our general aim is first and foremost to educate and inform roadusers, and to influence as many as possible into observing higher standardsthan the law lays down. But dangerous parking, the disregard of trafficsigns, and excessive speed are examples of traffic offences which are frequentlyfactors in causing accidents. Enforcement of the law in relation to offences of this kind is therefore essential to road safety, even though it is, in onesense, a last resort. We see it in fact more and more as a supplement toour programme of education, and this programme will have as one of itsaims the explanation of why in the interests of us all traffic offences havebeen created. It is not enough to prosecute people for offences against road safety. We intend to make sure that they understand what the offences mean in terms of accidents, since with understanding may come the voluntaryobservance which must be our objective.33. But it is still more important to get greater compliance with thelaw as it now stands. The police effort and its effectiveness have increasedsignificantly over the years. To give further assistance to the police theGovernment proposes to extend the powers and functions of traffic wardensso that they can be employed on many routine traffic duties, thereby releasingpolice officers for the more difficult jobs. They will have certain of thepowers of a constable under the Road Traffic Acts, though not that of arrest.This change would conform to the recommendations made last year by theSelect Committee on Estimates and those made recently by the PoliceAdvisory Board for England and Wales. Provision for it will be sought inthe next Transport Bill. The Government is also considering whether, wherea fixed penalty awarded for a parking offence is not paid by the driver, the registered owner should, subject to certain conditions, be liable to pay the fixed penalty which is due. It is also considering the extension of the fixedpenalty system to other offences.Motor cyclists and pedestrians34. Among the categories of road users, motor cyclists and pedestrianspresent two special problems, and both require special treatment. Mile formile, 20 riders of motor cycles or scooters are killed or seriously hurt forevery car driver. Mile for mile, motor cycles and motor scooters are involvedalmost four times as often as cars in accidents in which pedestrians arefatally or seriously injured. Young people are particularly at risk on two-wheeled motor vehicles: 12,300 riders and passengers under 20 were killedor seriously injured in 1966, as against 9,700 over 20. Motor cycles arethe most difficult vehicles to control. Only a limited amount can be done to build more safety into them. Yet they are the only motor vehicles thata 16-year old is at present permitted to drive, and there is very little organisedinstruction for the learner motor cyclist.
35. Motor cycling instruction has never been a paying proposition, andis very unlikely to become one. More motor cycle training is vital, butit will have to be sponsored. The foundations have been laid in the scheme,sponsored by the Royal Automobile Club and the Auto-Cycle Union, whichhas been supported for some years by the Government. This scheme gives the novice his first experience off the road, and under skilled supervision. Ithas not been used as widely as it deserves to be, partly perhaps because ithas not been well enough known, and partly because training centres havebeen few and far between. A working party, which included representativesof the motor cycling associations and also of the local authorities, recentlyrecommended that the scheme should be developed much more widely as anational motor-cycle training scheme, and that local authorities should assume responsibility for providing not only the training grounds, butalso the instructors and machines. The working party&apos;s report is being published separately. The Government considers that an expanded scheme could give very high returns in casualty savings, and the Minister ofTransport will discuss with local authorities how training on the scaleenvisaged could be provided most effectively, and in particular the basis on which it should be financed.36. Casualty rates for motor cyclists and scooter riders are highest forthe 16-year old. They then fall, at first sharply and then more graduallywith age. The reason is partly a matter of age, partly of experience. TheUnited Kingdom is the only country in Western Europe to permit 16-yearolds to ride two-wheeled motor vehicles irrespective of their capacity orweight. The present age limit has the effect of encouraging young people to ride motor cycles rather than to begin to drive cars, and it makes no sense to allow them to drive the most dangerous vehicles on the roads before they may drive the safest. So the Government is going to raise the age limit for driving a motor cycle or scooter of over 50 c.c. cylinder capacity from16 to 17 years of age. We recognise that to some extent this will transfer to the 17-year olds accidents due to inexperience, but the net effect will beto save about 2,000 fatal and serious casualties a year.37. A quarter of those killed or seriously injured on our roads arepedestrians: in 1966, there were 10,600 deaths and serious injuries amongpedestrians under 15 (which is 40 per cent of pedestrian casualties), and7,900 among pedestrians over 60. The Government has already announcedthat the number of zebra crossings is to be increased. But this is only a beginning. The Government has put in hand a review of the whole problemof pedestrian safety. It is considering many new measures to protectpedestrians: better lighting at pedestrian crossings, better marking of thecrossings, the installation of guard rails near them, rights of precedence asbetween motorists and pedestrians at junctions, more help for pedestrians atjunctions, an increase in linked traffic signal systems, a prohibition on parkingnear junctions. But in return pedestrians may have to accept somerestrictions on their freedom to cross the road where and when they like.The Government plans to put forward later this year comprehensive plans on pedestrian safety.
Vehicles38. Everyone, as an individual, can make his personal contribution tothe safer use of our roads. But we cannot eliminate human error.Improved design and performance of vehicles can make a vital contributionto road safety by reducing the number of accidents and by lessening therisk or extent of casualties when an accident occurs. Designers,manufacturers, operators and Governments have been working on vehiclesafety for many years. The vehicles on the road to-day are immeasurablysafer than they were. They are less likely to be involved in collisions, and give their occupants more protection if an accident occurs.Vehicle design and construction39. But they could be safer still. Almost 30 per cent of the fatal and serious injuries to vehicles users were caused in accidents in which theirswas the only one involved. In the past two years the Government hasreviewed existing regulations dealing with the main features of vehicledesign and performance which are crucial for safety. One specialist working group, including representatives of manufacturers, operators, unions and the many other interests with a real contribution to make in this field, hasconcentrated on brakes, a second on lighting. Many of their recommenda-tions have already been put into effect through regulations and the improved design of vehicles. Their remaining work will be completed thisyear. A third group is reviewing a wide range of other main features inthe construction of vehicles, including tyres, the fitting of safety belts, andso on. Again the results of much of its work have already been approved.Priority is being given to completing work on these aspects which can contribute most to safety and to its quick translation into practice. Themain departure is that the Government propose to require seatl-belts to befitted to cars made in 1965 and 1966; the great majority of cars made inthese years were manufactured with proper anchorage points.40. While concentrating first on completing work already in hand, theGovernment is now considering with the motor manufacturing industryfuture priorities in vehicle safety. They will agree with the industry a forward programme of action they can take together and of furthersupporting research where this is necessary, for the next generation of safety advances in vehicle design and performance.41. Changes in the design of vehicles, particularly if not properlyplanned, can be very costly. It is particularly important therefore to concentrate on measures that bring the best return in safety and wherever possible to introduce them at the design stage. Planning to get maximumsafety is complicated because, at present, British vehicles exported to foreigncountries have to meet a wide variety of differing regulations in different countries. This problem has been highlighted by the recent introduction ofnew Federal regulations in the United States. In many respects these regulations are similar to those already in force here: but some requiredifferent standards which conflict with ours. If an industry has to makecars to meet a range of different regulations the overall effect is to increasethe cost of production, both here and abroad and to reduce the overall value for money in safety terms.
42. The Ministry of Transport has, for many years, taken a full part in international discussions on vehicle safety, particularly at the United NationsEconomic Commission for Europe at Geneva (ECE). The Minister ofTransport has, this summer, taken a fresh initiative at the EuropeanConference of Ministers of Transport in Hamburg. She has proposed thatthe members of the Conference should work together to secure a greateruniformity in their national standards and should support an agreed programme for further work at the ECE aimed at those features with toppriority for safety. The Conference has accepted this suggestion and workon her proposals has already begun. The Government is also discussing with the authorities responsible in the United States possibilities forco-operation in research and development of improved safety standards forvehicles.Vehicle maintenance43. It is no use improving the quality of design and performance of vehicles if their safety standards are allowed to decline once they are putinto use on the roads. Public service vehicles buses and coaches have formany years been the subject of very rigorous inspection and supervision.The Government^ further proposals in respect of goods vehicles were described in Part II of the White Paper on Road Safety Legislation, 1965-66(Cmnd. 2859). These proposals have become law in this year&apos;s road safety Act. The compulsory testing and plating of existing goods vehiclesis planned to start in the summer of 1968 and to be placed on an annualbasis from January 1970. And we plan to start the new system of typeapproval for goods vehicles later in 1970.44. But this still leaves the private car and the small goods vehicle by far the largest numbers of vehicles on the roads to-day. All thesevehicles that are more than 3 years old are now required to be testedannually. There has been criticism of the way in which the present test iscarried out in some garages. The Ministry of Transport, with the full support of the Motor Agents Association and the Scottish Motor trade association, has taken steps to strengthen its supervision of garagesauthorised under the present scheme. More enforcement staff have been putinto this work. Each garage is inspected about twice a year. Complaintsfrom the public are followed up individually. And a new system has been introduced under which enforcement staff from the Ministry take vehiclesfor test to garages where they are not known and without revealing theiridentity until the test is complete. Where it is found that garages are not doing the tests properly action is taken against them; the authorisation of132 have been withdrawn in the last 12 months. In itself this figure is notlarge, representing less than 1 per cent of all the garages in the scheme.The Ministry of Transport is now completing a check on the standardsmaintained by a nation-wide sample of garages. If this shows that thereis justification in continuing complaints about the scheme, its wide basis of operation will be reviewed.45. In addition to the annual test, cars and small goods vehicles arealso stopped and examined on the road by examiners from the Ministry ofTransport and the police.   The Ministry&apos;s vehicle examiners are called in
to investigate some 5,000 vehicles a year which have been involved inaccidents (and in over 100 cases last year defects were reported back to the manufacturer). The Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill will give additional powers to require private cars found unsafe on the roads to be furtherinspected and to allow secondhand cars to be examined on dealers&apos; premises.These and other measures will increase the official supervision of the standardof safety of vehicles on the road. But, ultimately, the standard of everyvehicle on the road must remain the responsibility of the owner and thedriver. Once again, we must all come to understand that to keep our carsin a state of proper repair and maintenance is not only a responsibility thatwe should fulfil but an essential to keep ourselves and others from death orinjury.Roads and the road users&apos; environment46. Road accidents seldom have a single cause, and fewer still are wholly attributable to defects in the roads themselves. Indeed, soundconstruction and maintenance have characterised the British road system formany years, which is one reason why our road accident record is goodcompared with that of most other countries. On the other hand, we shall never wholly eliminate human error, and vehicles will never be perfectlyfoolproof and failsafe. By improving the roads and the road users&apos;environment, we reduce the occasions when human skill stands alone betweensafety and catastrophe.47. Every driver knows how often he meets situations where he couldbe caught unawares: corners that are sharper than they look; bends wherethe road surface is more slippery than it appears; walls and hedges that hidetraffic at a crossroads, places like shops or schools where pedestrians aremasked by cars waiting at the kerbside; streets where the children playhopscotch, or cluster round the ice cream van; the brow of a hill where acar is parked, the corner where the post-office van is collecting the mailfrom the pillar box. Every driver copes with a dozen hazards like these in a few miles safely enough as long as the other vehicles and other roadusers go true to form, so long as his brakes, his patience and his luck holdout.  But 800 times a day, somebody hits something, and someone is hurt.-48. Year by year, the building of housing estates and shopping precinctsto modern lay-outs and the creation of pedestrian routes and walk-ways in towns and cities make an increasing contribution to safety on the roads.The road programme itself is growing rapidly, and new modern roads,designed to carry the main traffic flows, have the highest attainable standards of safety built into them. Large-scale road construction schemes and majorenvironmental works are carried out where high traffic volumes or largenumbers of pedestrians would make for frequent accidents. But theirintensive benefits to road safety are necessarily localised. For the rest, andespecially for immediate results on the widest possible scale, we must pushahead with the smaller types of road works, and with traffic management, soas to apply remedial measures to accident spots on the road system andin the environment that we already have.49. Almost two-thirds of the fatal and serious casualties occur inbuilt-up areas.   The main attack must be directed to the relatively small
mileage of road in towns and cities. Pedestrian safety is particularly important there, because 90 per cent of the more serious casualties topedestrians happen in built-up areas. And the remedies are well known:subways, footbridges and guard rails along the kerb; where completesegregation is impossible, zebra crossings and central refuges. Whole areascan be made safer for pedestrians by comprehensive schemes to channelmotor traffic through distributor roads and by comprehensive parkingcontrol. A second objective is the improvement of junctions; junctionaccidents account for 60 per cent of the fatal and serious casualties inbuilt-up areas, and we know they can be reduced by prohibiting turningmovements, or elsewhere by installing priority signs or guide islands orwaiting areas for turning vehicles. At the busier urban intersections, wecan erect traffic signals. Night accidents cause 40 per cent of the fataland serious casualties outside built-up areas as well as within them. Theycan be dramatically reduced in built-up areas by modern road lighting:in the open country by cats eyes or reflective white lines at the edge ofthe road.50. Schemes of these kinds are continuously being carried out throughoutthe country. Upwards of  30 million a year is now being spent on thesmaller road improvement schemes costing less than  25,000 apiece.Small-scale roadworks of some types can give very high safety benefits inrelation to their costs. But there are many parts of the country where theroads have not recently been examined with the accident record at handand possible measures to reduce it in mind. Until this has been done, wecannot be sure that the country is spending its money as effectively or over as wide a front in saving accidents as it should. The Area road safety Units and some local highway authorities have shown how this canbe done, and to what effect. The Units are being strengthened and increased.And local authorities will have every encouragement and guidance toundertake this sort of examination for themselves. The additional information thus obtained will ensure that money, from whatever source,is spent where it does most good. The Government for its part, will give priority to those small road schemes which are shown in this way tohave a high safety content for their cost.51. The Government is playing its full part in enabling local authoritiesto create a safe environment for the users of the roads in their areas.Its specific grants for road improvement schemes on local authorities&apos;principal roads have increased and will go on increasing rapidly. It is making grants available for new lighting schemes on local authorities&apos;principal roads. Under the Local Government Act 1966, it has brought thelarger urban local authorities within the scope of rate support grant and thisis now paid from the Exchequer in respect of all local authority expenditureon road maintenance and improvement which does not qualify for specificgrant aid. The Act has also placed the responsibility for road lighting onthe larger local authorities who are highway authorities, so that properhighway lighting can be incorporated in to the design of the road. And theGovernment has taken over full responsibility for lighting its own trunk roads. It has embarked on a programme to install new lighting on morethan 500 miles of trunk road in Great Britain, and this programme willbe extended and rolled forward.
Section 5.  CONCLUSION52. The introduction to this paper described the trend of roadcasualties over the last 20 years. From them, it foreshadowed how theycould continue in the future. Nevertheless, a comparison of the present rateswith those of a generation ago shows clearly that accident rates on theroads can be reduced. The number of people killed on our roads each year in the early 1960s was no higher than it had been in 1933 and 1934.Although the traffic on the roads had increased enormously in the meantime,people had learnt to use them more safely; the law and its enforcement weredeveloped to eliminate some sources of danger, and the design andserviceability of vehicles had advanced; roads and their equipment had been improved; traffic regulation had gained wider acceptance. Rescue and hospital services had advanced. And above all, people were using safertypes of vehicles more, and the less safe types less. As a result, our accidentrates are now better than those of almost all developed countries, and much better than some.53. The fact remains that they are not good enough. They must bereduced still further. We already know a great deal about the factors thatcontribute to road accidents and the cost and effectiveness of counter-measures : this has enabled us to build up a programme of immediate action.The Road Research Laboratory is the most experienced and best equippedsingle organisation in the world for research into road safety in all its aspects. Further measures will follow from their current and future studies.The organisation for road safety is to be strengthened so as to bring theresults of current knowledge into practical effect on the ground. In all theseways the Government will give a firm and informed lead. But we can onlysucceed if all road users give a willing and full response. In the end, road safety is for the man in the street.Section 6.  SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS1. The Governments approach to the road safety problem is: first to getthe facts about accidents; second, to seek out and test remedies by scientific research; third to evaluate the remedies; fourth to try out on the ground andperfect them (Section 2).2. A Central Road Safety Unit is being brought together within theMinistry of Transport. It will be the driving force in getting things donein road safety (Section 3).3. The Government will give more help and guidance to local authoritiesthrough its Area Road Safety Units; the existing Units will be expanded;three new Units will be set up in England and one each in Scotland andWales (Section 3).4. Local authorities should widen the responsibilities of road safetyofficers, who should have more expertise and higher status in order that localroad safety effort can be managed more strongly (Section 3).
5. Local authorities are to be given wider discretion in the making oftraffic regulation orders (Section 3).6. The Government will launch for the first time a fully integratedprogramme of public information to increase road users&apos; knowledge andinduce more positive attitudes to road safety. Special publicity will promote the use of seat-belts and will explain the new law on drink and driving(Section 4).7. The Ministry of Transport will issue an official driving manual, and anew edition of the Highway Code (Section 4).8. The proposed compulsory register of professional driving instructorswill be used to raise standards of driving training (Section 4).9. The Government will intensify its research into driver trainingmethods, and will encourage the best methods of driver training for young people at school (Section 4).10. Proposals are being considered for legislation to extend the powersand functions of traffic wardens (Section 4).11. The Government will discuss with local authorities how motor-cycletraining can be provided on the proper scale (Section 4).12. The Government will raise the age limit for riders of two-wheeledmotor vehicles of over 50 c.c. from 16 years to 17 years (Section 4).13. The results of a wide-ranging review of pedestrian safety will be announced this year (Section 4).14. The Ministry of Transport will agree with the motor manufacturing industry a forward programme of research and action on vehicle safety(Section 4).15. The Government will introduce regulations requiring seat-belts tobe fitted to cars which came on the roads in 1965 and 1966 (Section 4).16. The Minister of Transport has taken the initiative in seeking with european Governments greater uniformity in national vehicle safety standards which are shown to have a high safety value for their cost (Section 4).17. The Ministry is completing a check on the standards maintained bygarages who operate within the annual car-testing scheme, and if the resultsso indicate the wide basis of the scheme&apos;s operation will be reviewed.18. The Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill will give greater powers tocontrol the condition of cars in use on the roads and on sale in dealers&apos;premises (Section 4).19. The Government will give priority to those small road schemes which are shown to have a high safety value for their cost (Section 4).20. New financial arrangements have been made to give local authoritiesa freer hand and proper financial support in the maintenance, improvement and lighting of their roads (Section 4).3S006    Dd.K      6/67
