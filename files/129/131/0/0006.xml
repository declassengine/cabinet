^DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY rS GOVERNMENT)TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING:  DRAFT WHITE paper memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland,the Minister of Housing and -Local Government andthe Secretary of State for WalesWe circulate, for the considered   ation of our colleagues, the draftof a White Paper on town and country planning which has been approvedby the Home Affairs Committee,     The purpose of the White Paper is to announce the substance of legislation to be introduced in the 1967-68Session for England and Wales, and in the I96&amp;-69 Session for Scotland.2.       As we explain in the White Paper, we want to modernise the main body of planning legislation which, in its essentials, goes back to theearly post-war years and owes so much to the care and foresight ofLewis Silkin,     There is now an urgent need to streamline procedures and cut down delays which have become a source of justified criticism;to ensure wider public participation in planning particularly when schemes are still at the formative stage;  and to adapt the planning process to match the advances in planning techniques and the economic and socialchanges that have taken place over the last 20 years.3.       The two most important alterations v/e propose concern the handling of appeals against decisions made by local planning authorities,and the content and procedure for approval of the development plansthey prepare.    At present, all planning appeals are decided in the nameof the Minister or the Secretary of State.    The proposal (paragraphs30-41 of the White Paper), which follows the recommendation of theCommittee on Tribunals and Enquiries, is that power should be takento authorise selected inspectors to decide minor cases that do notinvoke issues of policy.     This would greatly simplify the handling of thousands of cases each year and should lead to  a great improvementin speed of decision.    We believe too that most people would welcome the fact that their appeal was being decided by the man who heard theirarguments and inspected the site,4.       We propose (paragraphs 15-20) that the content of development plans should be broadened to take in not merely matters of land use butthe whole range of considerations that should determine the futurestructure of our towns and the policies for the countryside.     Inparticular, this means ensuring that traffic, transport and investmentpolicies are properly reflected in these plans.    At the same time, we propose that only these structural elements should normally requireMinisterial approval since one of the main causes of delay in planning in recent years has been the preoccupation of central government with c(67) 106COPY NO.15th June, 196?CABINET
the highly detailed proposals for land use that make up the greater partof the current plans.    These detailed matters would be dealt with in local plans which would, in the ordinary way, be left for settlement by the local planning authority,5,       In considering these proposals for development plans, the HomeAffairs Committee paid special attention to the measures needed tosafeguard objectors1 rights where planning authorities are approvingtheir own local plans and we propose to retain powers to intervene inthe handling of any local plan at any stage should circumstances demandthiss and to provide procedures which ensure that planning authoritiesdeal openly and fairly with those who object to their proposals.    Theseare set but in the Annex to the White Paper,6.       We now seek the agreement of our colleagues to the publicationof the White Paper at an early date, so that Parliament and the publicmay be able to consider the broad outline of our proposals and so that  /e may discuss them with the local authority associations and theCouncil on Tribunals before the legislation is introduced.W.R.A.C.C. K,Scottish Office, S.W.1,15th June, 1967
Now consolidated in the Town and Country Planning Act 1962TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING:1.        Town and country planning shapes the conditions in which welive together.    Planning decisions determine where and how new&quot;buildings may he built and whether existing uses of land and buildings may he changed.    In the broader sense, they largelydetermine the environment in which we shall live - whether ourtowns will be pleasant places to live in, and whether our homes,shops, factories, offices and places of leisure and entertainmentwill be in the right places, and with easy flowing communications between them.    They determine whether the countryside vail be pro-tected for farming, forestry and recreation, whether its beautywill be enhanced, and whether the fine buildings of the past willbe preserved against decay and wanton destruction.    They provide a framework within which thousands of millions of pounds are spentevery year on buildings and roads.2. It matters to everybody that we should have an up-to-date and effective town and country planning system which can help tobring these things about.    It matters, too, that the system shouldbe such that people can know about important changes before they take place and influence the decisions which may affect them.3.        Britain is fortunate in having had, for many years, the planning system established by the Town and Country Planning Act of19^7* and the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act of the sameyear.    It was then, thanks to the care and foresight ofLord Silkin, the most advanced and complete system of land useplanning in the world.    It did much to help in the reconstruction of our war-damaged cities and it protected the countryside from a resumption of the uncontrolled urban sprawl of the &apos;thirties.But the time has now come to profit from twenty years&apos; experience and to make the changes required by new circumstances, new policies and new advances in planning techniques.U. Three major defects have now appeared in the presentsystem.   First,  it has become overloaded and subject to delays andcumbersone procedures.    Second, there has been inadequateparticipation by the individual citizen in the planning process,and insufficient regard to his interests.    Third,  the system hasbeen better as a negative control on undesirable development than as a positive stimulus to the creation of a good environment.5. These are the main defects which the revision of the systemmust tackle and the G-overnment propose to remedy them.    To combinethe safeguarding of individual interests with quicker decisionsmeans streamlining;    to emphasise the positive environmentalapproach requires a concentration of effort on what is vital, and less central control over detail,&apos;    and, in considering the changesnecessary, we must recognise that planning now is operating in avery different context from that immediately after the War.A Hew Context for Planning6.        When the Acts were being prepared, planning was based on the belief that our population was likely to remain stable and therewas little appreciation at that tin? e  of the likely growth in thevolume of motor traffic - and still less of the impact that thiswould have on the structure of our towns and on the countryside.No?/, the best working assumption on population is -that we may have to/provide
provide homes for perhaps Mi million extra people in Great Britain&quot;by the end of the century - an increase of nearly a third.    As wellas building homes for a growing population, we must replace thosehouses which have come to the end of their useful life.    while this is a continuing process, there already exists a need for about 3 million houses to replace slums and other old houses which are not worth rehabilitating.    Not only must the occupiersbe- given new homes, but the cleared sites should be put togood use.7.        Meanwhile, traffic problems will be mounting.   -The number ofmotorcars on the road (already 9i million in 1966) is expected to exceed 18 million in 1975? with even bigger increases to follow.The revised planning system must be able to cope justly, flexibly,and swiftly with all this.8.        A new factor has &quot;been introduced into planning hy theGovernments regional policies and by the setting up of theEconomic Planning Councils in the regions and in Scotland and Vales.Some of these Councils have been publishing regional studies whichshould help to shape physical and economic development in the regions.    The new planning process must take account of theseevolving regional policies.9. The plans drawn up must also he realistic in financial terms and the demands they make on the main capital expenditure programmes must be reasonable in amount and in timing.    Howeveradmirable they may be, plans which cannot be realised arepositively harmful.    They stand in the way of more realisticplans, and cause needless worries to people who fear that their interests may be affected.10.       People must be able to participate fully in the planningprocess, and their rights must be safeguarded.    Many changes havealready been made in planning procedures following the report ofthe Committee on Administrative Tribunals*   in 1957 and. the subsequent setting up of the Council on Tribunals.    One of theGovernment&apos;s main aims in the present review of&quot; planning legislation is to ensure that there are greater opportunities for the discussionof important changes while they are still at the formative stage and can be influenced by the people whose lives they will affect.They intend also to maintain the rights of objectors - whether theyare individuals or organisations - to argue their case at the formal stages.11.       The problem is that safeguards built into the planningprocedure automatically slow it up.    Procedural safeguards, vitalthough they are,  slow the progress towards decision, and thereis growing impatience at present delays.    These delays may hold updevelopment that matters greatly to the people concerned, and maybe of economic importance for the country as a whole.    While thepreservation of proper rights of representation is of overriding importance, some streamlining of the system is essential ifunfairness to those who wish to develop is to be avoided.12.       There are therefore conflicting but basic requirements to be reconciled.    On the one hand there is the desire for more consulta-tion and wider association of the public with planning;    on theother, there is the need for quicker decisions.    The government believe that the way to satisfy these requirements lies in/devolutionCmnd.    218   H.M.S.O.    8s. net
devolution of responsibility for some planning decisions, and insimplification of procedures.   With these aims in mind, theGovernment have decided to introduce legislation to improve andmodernise the town and country planning system;    and this paperdescribes what they propose..OUTLINE OF PROPOSALS13.       Two main threads run through the present system:-(1) development plans prepared and reviewed periodicallyby the local planning authorities- and requiring theMinister1s** approval;    and(2)   development control exercised by the local planning authorities over new building and changes in the useof land and buildings.    There is a right of appeal tothe Minister against development control decisionsmade by the planning authorities;    and, whereunauthorised development takes place, planning control is enforced by means of notices issued by the planning authorities, which may also be the subject of appealto the Minister.1k.       Briefly, the Government now propose to  introduce 1-(1)    a new kind of development plan;(2) a new method of handling some planning appeals whichwill allow decisions to be reached sooner;(3)   more effective means of dealing with infringements of planning control;(4)    improved procedures for the preservation and maintenanceof buildings of historic or architectural importance:and(5)   miscellaneous improvements to planning law and procedures.DEVELOPMENT PLANS15.       The present development plans are failing to meet currentneeds.   Part of the trouble is that the areas they cover are too small;    the plan-making process is based upon local governmentboundaries which divide areas with competing and complementaryneeds and resources and, indeed, create planning problems byartificially separating town from country at the point wherepressure for change is greatest.    The structure of localgovernment and the size of the planning units required to meetmodern needs are being examined by the Royal Commissions on LocalGovernment in England and in Scotland  and by the Secretary of State16.       It is not only the administrative boundaries that are outof date:   the development plan itself has become an inadequate/instrument,*    Counties and county boroughs in England and Wales;counties and large burghs in Scotland.-**   In this paper, references to the Minister should be under-stood as references to the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment in England, and to the Secretary of State inScotland and in Wales.
instrument, both in its content and in its procedures.    The planconcentrates on land use, and does so in excessive detail.    Planningis not just a matter of prescribing permissible land uses, and making sure that incompatible uses are kept away from each other.What matters far more - certainly when it comes to central governmentlevel - is whether the physical environment as a whole is beingproperly shaped to meet evolving social and economic needs, withrealistic regard to investment programmes and priorities.    Inparticular, planning must be concerned with the critical problemsof movement that arise from the continuing growth of trafficgenerated by existing development, by redevelopment and by new development.    Planning of land use, of transport, and of investmentneeds to be integrated-in order to meet our economic aid social objectives.17.       The present concentration on the zoning of land for particu-lar purposes brings before the Minister for his approval a mass of detailed material.    Since so much detail is contained in the planssubmitted for ministerial approval,  it is not uncommon for hundreds of objections to be lodged,  for local inquiries into them to lastmany days and weeks;    and d ealing with the objections and othermatters arising from the plan inevitably takes a great deal oftime.    Further, the procedures introduced after the report of theCommittee on Administrative Tribunals and Inquiries may occasion asecond local inquiry.    Often approval of the statutory map for a town takes 3 to k years;   urgent proposals for comprehsiveredevelopment may wait 2 years for decision.    This concentration on a mass of detail has been at the expense of treating thedevelopment plan as a positive basis for environmental planning.The Planning Advisory Group18.       A Planning Advisory Group (P.A.G.) comprising officers oflocal government, the professions and Departments concerned wasappointed in 1964.    Its report, &quot;The Future of Development Plans&quot;,^-published the following year set out in detail the defects of thepresent type of development plan.    It recommended a new form ofplan consisting of:-(1)    a &quot;structure plan&quot; submitted for ministerial approval:this would be primarily a written statement of policy,accompanied by a diagrammatic structure map forcounties and major towns only, designed to exposeclearly the broad basic pattern of development and thetransport system.    These structure plans would form themain link between policies on a national and regional level and local planning.    They would indicate &quot;actionareas&quot;, i.e., areas where comprehensive treatment(development, redevelopment, improvement or a mixture)was envisaged in the ensuing ten years;(2)    &quot;action area plans&quot;    to be adopted locally,  showingthe shape of development in those areas;    and(3)    other &quot;local plans&quot;, to meet local needs, again to beadopted locally;The Group also recommended more straightforward powers of compulsory acquisition for planning purposes.Proposals for Legislation19.       The Government believe that a system following these recommendations is needed to improve the quality and effectiveness of planning.    It would make planning more relevant and more/flexible.*   H.M.S.O.    10s. netCONFIDENTIAL
flexible.    It would speed up ministerial approval by concentrating on the main issues of policy and removing from GovernmentDepartments detailed work which raises no issues of centralgovernment policy;    and It would improve procedures which nowcause complication and delay.20.       The Government therefore intend to introduce legislation tomodify development plans broadly on these lines.    It will take intoaccount two important questions raised in the comments about theGroup&apos;s report by the local authority associations and the public and professional bodies concerned.    These questions were:-(1)   whether the present local planning authorities are able to undertake this new and more sophisticated typeof planning;    and(2)   whether the procedures will ensure fair treatment ofthose affected by planning proposals.Transition to.,jthe^Jjfew^ j^st^21.       Some local planning authorities lack the resources to make an immediate start on the new system, and some well-organisedauthorities administer areas which make it difficult for them todraw up a satisfactory structure plan of the new type.   But others are anxious to make a start, are fully able to do so, and are being held back by the rigidity of the present statutory provisions.    Itis wrong that the planning of a number of important cities andcounties should be so constrained.    The Government therefore proposeto provide for the gradual introduction of the new system intothose parts of the country where it can usefully be operated in advance of its general introduction when local government isreorganised.   The transition to the new system will be a gradualone,  controlled by the Minister under powers which will be exercisedafter consultation with the local planning authorities concerned.Arrangements will be made for adapting the new system to thespecial circumstances of London,Planning Staffs22,       The Government recognise that however good the statutory andprocedural framework, success will depend largely on the availabilityand the correct use of professional staff in the planning field -planners, architects, engineers and surveyors.23.       The number of planners being trained by universities andfurther education establishments is being increased with the help and encouragement of the Government, Bat, though the situation will improve, there is at present a shortage and this will continue forsome years.    The authorities chosen for early transition to the new system must therefore show that they have the necessary nucleus of professional staff properly organised and deployed, and that theyare ready where necessary to supplement them by affording opportunity^-nities for training and by using professional skills from outside.Procedures2h,       The devolution of responsibility which is a cardinal feature of these proposals means that many matters of detail will no longertie submitted for ministerial approval as a matter of course.    it follows that there must be full safeguards for those affected bylocal plans (including action area plans) and proper opportunityfor the hearing of objections whether these are made by individuals or by local or national organisations.    These safeguards will beprovided and they are outlined, in the Annex to this paper,/25o
Cmnd. 2771 H.M.S.O.    is. 3d.25.       Both local plans and structure plans must he drawn up with proper regard to Government policies, and local planning authorities will &quot;be expected to consult fully, during the process of preparingplans, with Government Departments whose interests may be affected.Which these are will depend on the subject matter of the plan andthe area covered by it;   but they might, in a particular case,include, for example, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries andPood, the Ministry of Transport and the Board of Trade, as well asthe planning Departments.    In framing structure plans local planning authorities should also maintain close liaison with the regional planning machinery so that account can he taken, at theformative stage, of regional policy.26.       The existing powers of local planning authorities to acquire and compulsorily for planning purposes need changing.    the requirement that land subject to compulsory purchase should be&quot;designated&quot; in advance will he done avray with;    experience hasshown that it adds procedural complications without compensatingbenefits for anybody.    Consequent changes will be made to the procedures for compulsory purchase by the Minister of public building and Works and the Postmaster-General;    and the opportunitywill be taken to implement the undertaking given in the White paper on the Land Commission^ to enable all public authorities to use the vesting procedure available to the Land Commission.    The presentright of objection to compulsory purchase orders will, of course,be maintained.DEVELOPMENT CONTROL27.       The system of development control introduced by the Acts of1947 has, on the whole, worked well and the Government do notbelieve that there need be any great change.    The chief complaintis that decisions take a long time.    Sometimes this is unavoidable,if the proposal is controversial or difficult,  and if properopportunity is to be given to those affected to express their views.But present performance can be improved and, with the co-operationof the local authority associations, a management study of develop-ment control at local level is being undertaken.    The results ofthis should be available during the summer,  and recommendationsarising from it which would require legislation will be examinedthen.28.       The methods of controlling development to he carried out by statutory undertakers are also being examined.29v      There are three aspects of development control which urgently requirelegislative action.    These are the arrangements for asaung withappeals from decisions of local planning authorities, the enforce-ment of planning control, and the preservation of buildings ofarchitectural or historic importance.Planning Appeals30.       The number of planning appeals made to the Minister inEngland and Wales under section 23 of the Town and Country planning act 1962 has been running at a high level for several years.    Itreached a peak of over 1k,000 in 196h, falling to just under12,000 in 1966.    More than half of the appeals decided are thesubject of a local inquiry;    almost all of the remainder are settled after an informal visit to the site and an exchange of correspondence(&quot;the written representations procedure&quot;).
31,       There is no reason to expect any substantial reduction inthe flow of appeals, and the handling of these vast numbers is a major problem.    As early as 1957* when there were far fewer, theCommittee on Administrative Tribunals and Inquiries said that they&quot;did not regard it as satisfactory that a Government department should be occupied with appeal work of this volume, particularly as many of the appeals relate to minor and purely local matters in which little or no departmental policy entered.&quot;   this criticism is borne out by an analysis of the subject matter of appeals.   About 60% concern development on a small scale;    andmany of these, though of vital concern to the appellant, raiseissues of purely local significance.    They include, for example,minor residential development,  small groups of shops, smallcaravan sites, betting shops, garages and minor changes of use.About 25-30% relate to single houses.    Of all appeals, big and small,  that have been the subject of local inquiries over the last five years, 97.5% were decided as the inspector recommended.32.       One particularly unsatisfactory feature of the presentsystem is the time required to deal with an appeal.    It has been taking, on average, about nine months to issue decisions onplanning appeals which go to inquiry in England.    Part of the time is taken up in waiting for the local inquiry - because of the pressure on the inspectorate the average waiting period has at times been as long as six months - and part while the inspectorprepares a lengthy and detailed report of the inquiry, and whilethat report is considered.    Although the delays have already beenreduced,  it is clear that radical changes in the system are neededif there is to be a real and lasting improvement.    The preoccupa-tion of central government with matters that do not involvegovernment policy must be reduced;    and the process of handlingappeals must be simplified,,33.       The Government have considered whether it would be right toset up local tribunals to deal with certain planning appeals.    Onthe assumption that three-man tribunals would be required and thatthe necessary professional element would be provided by an inspector sitting as a member of the tribunals  several hundredlay members would be required.    This would be difficult.   Many ofthe people best able to undertake such work could not spare thetime, and others would already be associated with planning ordevelopment in their professional capacity, or in local government,to such an extent that they should not take part of the work of tribunials near their home.    It would also be difficult to get an even quality of decisions in different parts of the country.    Laytribunals could not be expected to have detailed knowledge of planning policies.    If there were inconsistency in their decisions,appellants and planning authorities would be rightly aggrieved.For these reasons this proposal has not been adopted.Proposed Delegation to Inspectors3h*       The Government propose instead to amend the law so as toenable the Minister to delegate to selected inspectors theresponsibility for deciding certain planning appeals in Englandand Wales.    This solution was recommended by the Committee onTribunals and Inquiries (paragraph 392 of their report).    They had also considered and rejected the idea of local tribunals.35.       The types of case to be dealt with in this new way will be defined by statutory instrument, vi/hich can be amended as a resultof experience and need.    The categories which seem suitable forthis treatment at the outset include single houses and residentialdevelopment on small sites,  small groups of shops, caravan sites of less than one acre, and other minor forms of development.    Where the/power
power to decide is delegated,  the decision will be the inspector&apos;s and not the Minister&apos;s, whether it follows a local inquiry or an exchange of written representations.    The minister would, however, be answerable in Parliament for the generaloperation of the system and for the planning policies within whichthe inspectors would continue to operate;    and the parliamentary commissioner for Administration will have the same powers of investigation as at present.    Inspectors&apos; decisions will besubject to the control of the courts, should there be an error oflaw or procedure, just as the Minister&apos;s decisions now are;    andthe conduct of appeals would remain subject to supervision by theCouncil on Tribunals as at present.36.       The advantage will be that the inspector who has visited the site and heard the arguments of the parties will immediatelytake the decision.    He will not have to write a detailed report forconsideration by others.    He will be able instead to prepare anddespatch, on his own authority, a letter setting out briefly but clearly the relevant facts,  the main arguments on both sides,  andthe reasons for his decision.    In cases dealt with by inquiry, the aim will be for the inspector to send the decision letter to theparties v/ithin too to three weeks whereas under the present systemit takes three months or more to issue a decision after an inquiry.The new procedure will shorten the time taken after the inquiry todecide appeals which are suitable for delegation;    it will alsohelp ind-irectly by reducing the burden of report-writing on the inspector.    It should also lead to a useful reduction in the waiting period for inquiries.37.       The ;,written representations procedure&quot;, now used for nearly half the planning appeals decided,  is suitable for caseswhere the issues are primarily local and there is no importantthird-party interest.    Many cases suitable for settlement byinspectors should therefore be handled by this method.    The pro-cedure has the virtues of saving time5 trouble and expense to theparties and its use will be encouraged.38.       Within the categories proposed for delegation,  cases will still arise which require ministerial decision because they raise questions of policy,  are of exceptional public importance, or areunusually complex.    The Government propose that the Minister shouldhave power to direct that particular cases or kinds of case shouldhe decided by him, notwithstanding that they fall within one of theprescribed categories for delegation.    These cases would then be handled in accordance with existing arrangements.    It would also beopen to an inspector to decline to decide an appeal if mattersarose (for example, unforeseen issues of policy) which he consideredshould be referred to the Minister.    In these cases the inspectorwould make this known to the parties and would report to theMinister instead of issuing his own decision letter.39.       This new procedure will mean that although for some appeals,appellants and local planning authorities will no longer receive a ministerial decision, they will receive an-earlier decision and they will have the satisfaction of knowing that it has been beaten by an inspector with first-hand knowledge of the sitewho has himself listened to the arguments put forward.^0.       The Government intend to limit delegation in the first place to appeals against planning decisions of local planning authorities(sections 23 and 2h, of the Act of 1962) relating to development ona comparatively small scale (see paragraph 35 above).    Butprovision would be made for other types of appeal to be delegatedhy statutory instrument as and when this proves useful and desirable.
k1.       In Scotland proportionately far fewer appeals are lodged;there were only 302 In 1966, of which 168 were withdrawn.Inquiries are taken not &quot;by salaried inspectors but by independentreporters who are seldom qualified planners.    There is not the same proportion of cases which would be susceptible of delegation evenif qualified inspectors were appointed to take inquiries.    Also,because of the much smaller number of cases,  improvements in management leading, for example, to the quicker submission bylocal planning authorities of observations on appeals, could havea relatively greater effect.    Still, growing pressure on land inScotland may greatly increase the number of appeals.    TheSecretary of State therefore intends to take the powers of delegation outlined in paragraphs 3k to kO, but, before exercisingthem he will explore new ways of expediting the handling of casesthrough the present machinery.Enforcement of JPl^anning. ControlU2.       The enforcement of planning control under the Act of 1962 isslow and complicated, and some elements of the law a s it standsfavour the contravener.    Enforcement action can only be taken within four years of the contravention;    after four years, unauthoriseddevelopment becomes established and immune from enforcement.    Anenforcement notice is stayed if an appeal is made to the Minister,and it is thus in the interest of the contravener to spin outproceedings as long as possible.U3.       The Government intend to abolish the &quot;four-year rule&quot;, sothat it will not in future be possible for unauthorised develop-ment to become immune from enforcement action by the mere passageof time.   Further, local planning authorities will be empowered toserve a notice requiring the immediate stopping of any operations which are the subject of an enforcement notice.    If proceedings onthe relevant enforcement notice show that permission was notrequired,  the planning authority would be liable to pay compensation for loss or damage resulting from,the cessation of operations &quot;brought about by the stop notice.Uk.       Present enforcement provisions in Scotland differ slightly in detail, hut the same difficulties exist and the same basicapproach will be adopted.Preservati onk5.       The Government have welcomed the changes to be made by theCivic Amenities Bill at present before Parliament, but they propose also to make some further improvements in the protection afforded to buildings of special historic or architecturalinterest.OTrlHR IJATTBRSk6 The opportunity will also he taken to make a number ofother improvements and simplifications in the law,  and to dealwith certain practical difficulties which have arisen in its operation.   Consideration is being given to the question whetherlong standing planning permissions which have not been exercisedshould remain valid indefinitely. -, Improvements will be proposed-in the present powers to stop up or divert highways;    at prG^enj.,.&quot;these are inadequate for the implementation&apos; of-$planning policies,particularly in relation to urban renewal.    Local new streetbye laws, which in many respects duplicate planning control, will., .be abolished., ;;!eh/CONCLUS&quot;
15th June, 1967.       The Town and Country Planning Acts of 19U7 gave Britaina system of land use planning which has served well;   hut thetime has now come to modernise it.    It must he speeded up,so that growth is not delayed or frustrated;    it must hebroadened, both to take advantage of new advances in techniqueand to set problems of land use in the wider context oftraffic, transport and investment policies.    The safeguards for the individual which form &quot;part of the system must beretained and strengthened.    The Governments proposals providefor this.    The new forms of plans and the procedures associatedwith them will give everyone a clearer grasp of changes thatmay affect them, and will give them full opportunity to express their views.    The devolution of responsibility to local planning authorities to decide their cwn local plans, and the delegation of certain appeal decisions to inspectors, will help to simplifyand shorten planning processes.k&amp;.       These have been the Governments aims in reviewing the law/.    They are now anxious to receive the views of intej^estedorganisations (including the local authority associations and the Council on Tribunals) on how these- aims can best be;achieved, within the framework proposed in this White Paper.
1.     The Minister will approve structure plans which will he prepared for counties, county borougns and other towns of over -50,000 population (and corresponding local government areas inScotland) and, on the Minister&apos;s direction, for other towns withsignificant planning problems.    Structure plans will follow a procedure very similar to that adopted for the current development plans.    They will be placed on deposit, an opportunity forobjections will be given and a local inquiry will be held into theobjections.   The Minister will issue his decision on the structureplan after considering his inspector&apos;s report.   The decision willtake the form of a letter commenting on, and expressing approval ordisapproval of, the main policies and proposals presented by thelocal planning authority in their structure plan.Local Plans2.     Local plans will be prepared within the framework of the policies approved in the structure plan.    They will in the normal course of events be adopted by the local planning authority afterfollowing prescribed procedures, and will not require the Minister&apos;approval.    The planning authority will be required to consult with local interests during the plan-making process, before resolvingto deposit a plan formally for public objection.   The authority will be required to consider objections and representations and to afford a hearing to any objector who so desires;    the report ofany hearing or inquiry will be published.    They will be required togive notice of intended modifications to the deposited plan and time will be allowed for the lodging of objections to thosemodifications by persons affected.   Having considered any such further objections the authority will resolve provisionally toadopt a plan, subject to specified modifications, and after thelapse of not less than 28 days, will be able to confirm that resolution, the plan thus adopted then becoming part of thedevelopment plan for the area.3.     Some local plans should be subject to further safeguards.These will be comprised In powers for the Minister:-(1 )    to call-in any local plan and decide it himself,  just as he may at present call in any planning application.Where a local plan comes to the Minister under this procedure it &quot;will be handled in the same way as astructure plan and will go through the normal processof objection and public inquiry.    This procedure willbe appropriate in cases of national importance, of verygreat controversy, or of unusual technical complexity;(2)    to require a local plainning authority to arrange apublic local inquiry conducted, by a person appointed bythe Minister,   The report of the inquiry will be made tothe planning authority.   The authority will be requiredto publish it and to resolve on each of the inspector&apos;srecommendations severally before adopting the plan.   this procedure will be suitable where the issues are not ofnational significance, but raise acutely the question offairness between the citizen and his local authority,e.g., a controversial policy to erect new offices for theauthority;AMjEXPROPOSE!: NEW PROCEDURES FOR DEVELOPMENT PLANSStructure Flans
il.     The combined effect of these proposals is that:-(1)    when the Minister is dealing with a plan, existingprocedures will be virtually unchanged;   but, sincethe number of plans requiring ministerial approval willbe reduced and their content will be far less detailed,a substantial speeding up in the process of approvalshould be achieved;(2)    where a plan is left for local approval, objectors willhave the same rights of being heard before the localauthority as they have at present before the Minister;and, where circumstances justify this course, the hearing will be before an inspector appointed by theMinister who will report to the local planning authority;(3) the Minister will have powers which will enable him todeal with any local plan if at any stage It appears tohim that it should not be left for local settlement.
