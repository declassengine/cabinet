&amp;c7(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidnetial cabinet of^ICFrecord copy copy na -24th May,  1954CABINETUNITED KINGDOM ASSOCIATION &quot;WITH THEEUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL community memorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations at their meeting on 7th April (C. C. (54) 27th Conclusions, Minute 3)the Cabinet agreed that a Ministerial Committee &quot;should formulate and submit to the Cabinet instructions to the United Kingdom delegation whichwould negotiate with the President of the High Authority the form of theUnited Kingdom&apos;s association with the Authority&quot;.    This Committee, over which I presided, has held three meetings, as a result of which a wide areaof agreement has been reached on the instructions to be given to our negotiators;  this is summarised below.Visit of M. Monnet2.        It is hoped that it will be possible to defer the visit of M. Monnetuntil about 18th June, so that the President of the Board of Trade will beable to take part in the discussions.    The Minister of-Supply, the Ministerof Fuel and Power and a Treasury Mlinister will also wish.to take part.    Itis considered that the ideal arrangement would be for the Foreign Secretaryto preside at the meetings, or at least to launch the proceedings, but should this prove impossible other arrangements will have to be made.3.        There is no intention, either on the part of M. Monnet or on our part, that the initial discussions should take the form of a detailed technicalnegotiation.    We should hope to exchange our ideas on the form whichcloser association should take, after which Ivl. Monnet would go away tothink over our proposals;  and detailed negotiations by officials would follow.United Kingdom objectives in the discussions4.        For political reasons we wish to secure as close a form ofco-operation with the High Authority, in both coal and steel, as we are able without forfeiting the support of the United Kingdom industries concerned.    We therefore favour an empirical approach to the detailsof a closer association, by seeking to secure co-operation through thediscussion of common problems in a Council of Association, on which boththe Iron and Steel Board and the National Coal Board would be represented.The setting up of such a Council should be our immediate objective in theforthcoming talks with M. Monnet.    Details of how it might be composedand of the sort of problems which it might handle are set out in Annexes 1and 2 to this paper;  but until we have heard M. Monnet&apos;s views we should wish to keep the details fluid.1-
7oConduct of the discussions5.        In his letter of 24th December to the Head of the United kingdom delegation to the European Coal and Steel Community (E.C.S.C.) (Appendix Ato C. (54) 20), M. Monnet suggested that the following should be theessential points in the negotiations for the establishment of closer tiesbetween the E. C. S. C. and the United Kingdom:-(i)     an association between markets by virtue of the reduction,and if possible the elimination, of reciprocal protectivemeasures, and the institution of rules which each partyundertakes to respect;(ii)     a procedure for common action;(iii) joint institutions responsible for watching over the opera-tion of the system, for preparing common action and for taking decisions reached in common agreement.It is therefore certain that he will raise at an early stage the possibilityof common markets, or failing that, of a reduction in tariffs.     It is alsoclear that he envisages the Council of Association as the continuingmachinery required to oversee agreements reached on matters of substanceand to extend the area of co-operation between the E. C.S. C. and theUnited Kingdom.6. &apos;      On the first point, the Committee are agreed that, because of theopposition of the National Coal Board, the Iron and Steel Board and theEngineering Advisory Council (who might be expected to be thebeneficiaries from a common market for steel) we cannot contemplatejoining a common market in either coal or steel.    On the question ofsteel tariff, we should take the line with M. Monnet that we are preparedto negotiate a reduction, if this can be agreed on mutually advantageous terms.    We should point out that the negotiation of the tariff would be amatter for the United Kingdom Government, but that we should have tocarry the industry with us;  and that we should not wish to defer the setting up of a Council of Association until this negotiation, which may takefrom six to twelve months, was completed.7.        On this last point, however, we are not unanimous.    ThePresident of the Board of Trade, while accepting the general line proposed,feels strongly that it would be a mistake to set up the proposed Council of association before a mutually acceptable reduction of the steel tariff hasbeen negotiated.8.        On the other matters for collaboration, we should emphasise theimportance of solving these empirically, and for this reason we should wish first to set up a Council of Association which would among other things enable the United Kingdom Boards concerned to meet the high authority across fche table to thrash out questions of common concern.We regard this as the only way of securing the co-operation of theindustries in solving the problems of closer association.    By agreeing to set up a Council of Association at an early stage in the negotiations andto remit to it a wide range of problems on which we regard agreement asboth desirable and possible, we should also hope to secure political advantages which might be lost if we embarked on a prolonged initialnegotiation on points of substance.    In Annex 2 to this paper there area number of important problems which we would remit to the Council.
Summary of recommendations.        Accordingly the majority of the Committee recommend:-(a) That exploratory discussions should start with m. JVIonneton about 18th June with the aim of reaching as close a form of association with the E. C.S. C. as we can getwith the support of the coal and steel industries.(b) That our objective should be to reach agreement to setup a Council of Association with.the E.C.S.C., composed as suggested in Annex I.(c) That in the discussions we should refuse to enter a common market for coal or steel, but should express our willingness to negotiate a reduction in the steel tariff, if this can beagreed on mutually advantageous terms.-(d) That we should seek to secure the co-operation of the coal and steel industries in negotiating in the Council of association as wide a range of agreement with theE.C.S.C. as possible on the problems outlined in Annex 2.SWINTONCommonwealth Relations Office, S.W.T.24th May,   1954.
The precise form of the joint institution will have to bedetermined after the exchange of views with M. Monnet, but the followingoutline might serve as a basis for discussion.2.        In order that matters proper to the Governments sphere ofresponsibility can be reserved for decision and/or negotiation by theGovernment the Council might consist of two tiers.    The top tier shouldon the United Kingdom side be wholly governmental consisting ofMinisters with officials as alternates according to circumstances and onthe High Authority1 s side of M. Monnet and Members of the Authority.The lower tier should consist of two parallel groups, one for coal andone for steel, each of which would contain, on the United Kingdom side,Government representatives (i.e. officials) and representatives of theNational Coal Board and the Iron and Steel Board respectively.    TheHigh Authority might be represented by senior officials.    These groupscould meet jointly if necessary to consider matters of concern to boththe coal and steel interests.3.        It would be part of the function of the top tier to act as asteering body for the two working groups on the lower tier.     In this wayit should be possible to organise and divide the work according to therespective responsibilities of the parties.4.        Matters arising out of the association which are more appropriate on the Community&apos;s side to the Council of Ministers than tothe High Authority could be discussed either:-(a) by arranging meetings outside the Council of association between United Kingdom Ministers on the one hand and the Council ofMinisters on the other;  or(b) by broadening the Council of Association for some of itsmeetings, so that it consists, on the Community&apos;s side, not only of theHigh Authority but also of representatives of the Council of Ministers.5.        Questions such as the location of the Council and the relationship to it of the permanent United Kingdom Delegation to theHigh Authority in Luxembourg will need further consideration in thelight of the decisions on the Council&apos;s functions and composition.THE COMPOSITION OF A COUNCIL OF ASSOCIATION
731.        Consultation with, a view to possible co-operation on thefollowing matters could come within the purview of a Council of association:(a) Questions affecting trade in coal and steel between theUnited Kingdom and the Community.(b) Action on supplies and prices in times of surplus andscarcity.     Consultation might take place when either party contemplatedtemporary measures designed to deal with difficulties of the market.(c) Price policy.    Although the pricing powers of the high authority, the National Coal Board and the Iron and Steel Board are notidentical, there is scope for consultation both about the methods of pricefixing and general price policy.    In relation to prices (and supplies) inthird markets, care will have to be taken not to give the appearance ofganging up against third countries;  the Commonwealth and Scandinaviahave shown themselves particularly sensitive on this point.(d) Supplies of raw materials;  and in particular, the import and export of scrap, and scrap prices including equalisation arrangements;also the development of sources of raw materials abroad.(e) General objectives in regard to modernisation, the long&quot;term planning of production, and the expansion of productive capacity, but without obligation to consult on individual development projects.(f) The study of market and price trends.(g) Forecasts of production, consumption, imports and exports.(h) The training of workers, and general safety measures.(i) The encouragement of technical and economic research.2.        The following are matters in which the High Authority hascertain responsibilities but about which we should not wish to have any specific obligation to discuss:(a) Re-employment of workers.    An obligation to consult onthis subject could only result in continuous pressure on the United kingdom to take surplus labour from the Community countries.    This is best dealtwith bilaterally on a Government basis, when all classes of workers canbe considered.(b) Improving the living and working conditions of the labour force.    An obligation to discuss labour conditions would inevitably involvewage questions which in this country are traditionally the province of collective bargaining.-1-POSSIBLE FUNCTIONS OF A COUNCIL OF ASSOCIATION
(c) Common definition of skilled jobs and conditions ofqualification   for workers.    This arises from the surrender of sovereignty by the E.C.S.C. member countries and is not appropriate ifwe are not joining the common market.(d) Transport.    The essence of the Community&apos;s Treatyprovision is the principle of non-discrimination through declaredtransport rates.    To accept this would involve reversal of the policy ofthe recent Transport Act which gives freedom to fix rates withoutpublication and on a competitive basis.3.        In some of the matters dealt with in paragraph 1, inter-national discussions already take place, particularly in the Coal andSteel Committees of the Economic Commission for Europe and theOrganisation for European Economic Co-operation.   This need not preclude our having an arrangement to discuss them with the E.C.S.C.,but it will face these other organisations with problems of adjustment in preventing overlapping and in re-assessing what distinctive interestsremain to be dealt with by them.     From the political point of view thisrequires careful handling so as to prevent any undesirable weakening ofexisting international organisations.4.        The High Authority does not have complete powers in respect ofall the matters for joint consultation suggested in paragraph 1.    Wherethey have not, we should in general be prepared for the High Authorityto act as the agent of the Governments of the six member countries if those countries so desire; but we might wish to be free to discuss someaspects of our association direct with the member Governments where,for example, some reciprocal concession we wanted for a concession onour part did not come within the competence of the High Authority.
