FUTURE ARRANGEMENTS FOR SUGARMemorandum by the Minister of food on 13th May the Economic Policy Committee approved theproposals made in my memorandum E,A,(54) 61 for carrying cut our obligations under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement and for thefuture of the British Sugar Corporation.2. I have reason to believe that these proposals, which are designed to make it possible to end direct state trading in sugar, willbe acceptable in principle to Commonwealth sugar producers and torefiners and other members of the sugar trades in this country.    As,however, they involve the establishment of a Sugar Board and the conversion of the British Sugar Corporation - the monopoly processerof sugar beet - from a private company to a company controlled by statute, I think that my colleagues should know of the matter at this stage.3. It might be argued that both the proposed Sugar Beard and the altered status of the 3ritish Sugar Corporation provide awkwardprecedents, bearing in mind the threat of nationalisation of the sugarrefining industry at the time of the last General Election.    It is howeveragreed by all concerned, including Tate and Lyle, that some suchorganisation as a sugar board is essential to the restoration of freeconditions with the Commonwealth Agreement in being, and the presentposition of the British Sugar Corporation is recognised to be highlyanomalous.     Moreover nothing can alter the fact that when the Ministryof Food ceases to be the sole importer of sugar the purchase andrefining of both home-grown and imported sugar will be returned to thehands of highly protected monopolies.    Y;re shall not obscure this fact by attempting to ignore it and, in my view, we are more likely to securegeneral approval, and a settled future for the sugar industry, by offering a compromise solution which will avoid the extremes of partisanship on both sides.    This is what my proposals are designed to achieve.G, IjXj.-G.CABINET OFFICE COPy NC. 1RECORD COPY -Ministry of Food, S.W.1.18th May, 1954.secret.(54) 16718th May, 1954CABINET
