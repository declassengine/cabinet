Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1954SECRETCABINET OFFIC1RECORD copy copy No.     iC. (54) 16318th May, 1954CABINETFUEL policy memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power on 6th October, 1953, the Cabinet appointed a Committee under theChancellor of the Exchequer to formulate and submit for their considerationproposals for a comprehensive Government policy on coal (C.C. (53) 55th Con-clusions, Minute 4). At this Committee&apos;s request i now submit my proposals tothe Cabinet.2. By the time that atomic energy is available to carry a significant shareof the fuel and power load, we may hope to have a smaller, highly mechanisedand much more efficient coal mining industry that will be far better able to meetthe demands of our fuel economy. But until then, and certainly for the next tenyears, we shall have to do our best with the other means at our disposal to remedy the chronic shortages and other difficulties that have afflicted coal ever sincethe war.3. During the next few years our coal policy should aim at the followingobjectives:  (a) Coal exports on at least their present scale and abolition of domestic coalrestrictions which soon will be the last survivor of war-time rationing.(b) An end as soon as possible to opencast coal mining on good agricultural land.(c) The creation as soon as possible of a special reserve of coal of from 5 to10 million tons as an insurance against the continuing threat of a fuelcrisis.4, Before the war an extra 50 million tons of coal could be obtained if neces-sary by drawing on a reserve of 150,000 unemployed miners. Then the spur ofunemployment and low wages kept shift output high and absenteeism low. Butfear of poverty and of unemployment no longer operates. We must continue themost determined efforts to secure by better leadership, labour relations and organ-isation a change of spirit in the industry. i am in constant touch with Sir HubertHouldsworth, the Chairman of the National Coal Board (N.C.B.), on these matters and one result is that the Board are now inquiring into their present organisation with the assistance of a small high-powered Committee drawn from outside theindustry and presided over by Dr. Fleck, Chairman of LCI. The Committee are going about their work with great thoroughness and are not likely to producetheir report before the end of the year. In the meantime I shall continue to pressupon the Board the extreme importance of improving the morale and performance of the industry, but I suggest that there is also action of various particular kindsthat we should take.5. Production could be increased if more men were available in the rightplaces. The worst, though not the only, shortages are in South Wales, Yorkshireand the West Midlands and in the two of these three areas where production could most quickly be increased there is strong competition for labour from other indus-tries.  Great efforts are anyhow needed to keep pace with the wastage of 60,000
2miners a year over the industry as a whole, and while some improvement tends to follow wage increases we cannot nowadays count on getting a net increase ofmore than a few thousand miners in any year. This year, indeed, manpower has consistently been at a lower level than last year (it is at present 6,700 lower), and ithink we shall do well if we make good this deficiency.6. For higher coal output we must therefore chiefly rely on greater produc-tivity and, as a means to this end, on capital investment. This is going on, but newmine sinkings and major reconstruction schemes take from 7 to 10 years to cometo fruition and in the short term we cannot reasonably expect an annual increaseof more than 2 per cent. (i.e., 4 million tons of coal). Even this assumes that open-cast mining is maintained at a high level, that uneconomic pits are kept in pro-duction and that Saturday working continues. So far this year we are failing toget anything like this 4 million ton rate of increase, and unless there is soon a significant improvement we may have to face a prospective shortage of 3 million tons before the end of the year and provide against it by further imports additional to the 1 million tons that I have already asked the Chancellor of the exchequer to authorise. Sir Hubert Houldsworth has convinced the miners&apos; leaders that moremust be done and the Miners&apos; Executive have now sent an appeal to all coalfieldsurging the need for greater effort; this is being followed by a delegate conferencein London. The position will need careful watching over the next few weeks witha further review at the end of June.7. Looking further ahead, i believe that if industrial demand continues to grow we must expect the estimated increase in coal output of 4 million tons tobe absorbed each year by an increase in consumption. Until the industrial recessionof 1952 consumption was increasing by about 4 million tons a year and so far thisyear the increase is running well above that figure.8. Thus, if nothing further is done, we are likely to find ourselves in two orthree years&apos; time in much the same position of general coal stringency that hasexisted ever since the war. At present the stranglehold of the miners can beabsolute. By a three weeks&apos; strike in the winter, which they could well afford,they could bring our whole economy to a standstill. By less extreme measures,for example, by a slowing down of Saturday working, they could land us, withthe balance so finely adjusted, in extreme difficulties. The Saturday shift is a purely voluntary surrender by the miners of the five-day week, which is theirs byright under the existing wage agreements. Although the National Union of Mine-workers are politically opposed to the present Government and would be within their rights in refusing to extend the Saturday working agreement, year by yearthey have agreed to it. But the responsible leaders may not always be able tocarry the day.9. A general coal stoppage would have disastrous consequences which neitherwe nor any other Government could avert. But there are certain new policies thatI wish to recommend which would at least protect us against the consequences of a &quot; go-slow &quot; (e.g., on Saturday working) and would at best bring the achieve-ment of our other objectives into sight. These policies are designed, first, to use coal to better advantage and, secondly, to increase our total fuel supplies.Better Use of Present Coal Supplies10. Within the general shortage of coal, there is a special shortage of certainkinds of coal, in particular, the carbonisation coals used by the steel and gasindustries, and large coal used by the railways and the householder; and both these kinds of coal are of special value to our export trade. The price mechanismcan be used to shift some of the demand from the scarcer to the more plentifulcoals and, under arrangements approved by the Government, a move has beenmade in this direction by weighting the recent increase in the price of coal more heavily against the scarcer kinds of coal.11. The main consumer of large coal is the householder, and here theprocess of price differentiation has been carried still further by widening the pricedifferences between the higher and the lower grades of house coal. But there isthe special difficulty that the lower grades of house coal contain a higher proportionof small coal, and the older fire grates do not burn this smaller coal satisfactorily.The householder^ proper course is to install one of the modern improved firegrates which will burn it quite well. i believe that with some special inducementand appropriate publicity many householders can be persuaded to install new
grates this summer, but without an inducement they will not. I am, in thesecircumstances, personally in favour of offering a subsidy of say  la new grate fora period of one year, at a total cost probably not exceeding  1 million.12. It has been suggested that this subsidy might be linked with our policy for cleaning the atmosphere, since coke, the only kind of smokeless fuel that can at present be made available in quantity, can be burned in the improved grates,but not satisfactorily in the old ones. I would be ready to limit the subsidy togrates installed in the &quot; foggy &quot; areas (to be defined by the Committee under sir Hugh Beaver) where the establishment of smokeless zones is most desirable and I am considering this possibility with the Minister of Housing.13. The railways come next to the householders as important consumers oflarge coal. Our present locomotives cannot burn small coal economically but therailways are providing useful savings of large coal by electrification, by the use ofdiesel engines and, more important in the short term, by the use of small coalmade up into briquettes. The railways are expecting to burn this year all thebriquettes (estimated at about 1 million tons) that the existing briquette-making capacity can provide for them. They are willing to take more briquettes pro-vided they are of suitable quality. This increase will entail, first, the release bythe British Electricity Authority (B.E.A.) of certain special qualities of Welsh coalused at power stations and, secondly, the construction by the National Coal Boardof additional briquette-making capacity. The substitution of other kinds of coal would cost the B.E.A. 20s. to 30^. a ton more, mainly on account of additionaltransport charges, and the N.C.B. would lose 255. a ton on the briquettes, with a chance, too, that some of the new plant costing  5 millions for an additional2 million tons capacity may become obsolete in a few years if other methods ofbriquetting are devised. Looking at the matter narrowly from their own industrialpoint of view neither industry would embark on this programme, but bearing inmind our need for large coal and the loss of  2 a ton that the N.C.B. are at presentincurring on imports, I consider that these changes would be in the public interestand that the real cost of the switch would be small. I would propose, therefore,to require the N.C.B. and the B.E.A. to make these changes.Oil to Increase Total Fuel Supplies14. While the policy outlined in the preceding paragraphs will improve thebalance of our existing supplies, in particular by reducing the demand for scarcelarge coal, it will not increase our total supplies, which, if nothing more is done,will remain in the precarious balance already described. Since we estimate thatgrowing consumption will absorb the whole of the 4 million tons increase in pro-duction that we expect each year, we can only look for a further increase in fuel supplies from either the use of more oil or the import of foreign coal. There isa clear balance of payments advantage in using more oil rather than importedcoal and, now that we have great oil refineries in the United Kingdom, I am sure that our policy should turn increasingly to oil. Without deliberate action on our part, however, we cannot hope for a faster development of the use of oil than isat present going on and we should, I think, take action at points where Governmentpressure or persuasion can be exerted. For practical purposes this field is limitedat the present time to the nationalised industries railways, gas works, and power stations.15. If the railway coal-oil conversion programme, halted in 1947 owing to shortage of oil supplies, had still been operating, its extension now would havebeen one way of obtaining further supplies of coal. By providing a direct releaseof large coal, it would also have rendered unnecessary the rather complicatedprocess now proposed for the release of small coal by the power stations to bemade into briquettes for the railways. I understand, however, that the transport commission would be very reluctant to undertake a new conversion programme without a subsidy from the Exchequer to meet the new capital expenditure on oildepots and conversion of locomotives, together with the operating loss on theuse of oil, which is estimated at about  1 a ton of coal saved. For this reason Iwould not at this stage press that course upon the Minister of Transport.16. Thus we are left with the gas and electricity industries. I propose toask the gas industry to press on with large-scale experiments for the use of oil in place of carbonising coal. They should not need much urging, for it is increas-ingly clear that with the rising price of coal their best means of countering the
grates this summer, but without an inducement they will not. i am, in thesecircumstances, personally in favour of offering a subsidy of say  1 a new grate fora period of one year, at a total cost probably not exceeding  1 million.12. It has been suggested that this subsidy might be linked with our policy for cleaning the atmosphere, since coke, the only kind of smokeless fuel that can at present be made available in quantity, can be burned in the improved grates,but not satisfactorily in the old ones.

The substitution of other kinds of coal would cost the B.E.A. 205. to 30s. a ton more, mainly on account of additionaltransport charges, and the N.C.B. would lose 25s. a ton on the briquettes, with a chance, too, that some of the new plant costing  5 millions for an additional2 million tons capacity may become obsolete in a few years if other methods ofbriquetting are devised. Looking at the matter narrowly from their own industrialpoint of view neither industry would embark on this programme, but bearing inmind our need for large coal and the loss of  2 a ton that the N.C.B. are at presentincurring on imports, I consider that these changes would be in the public interestand that the real cost of the switch would be small.

Since we estimate thatgrowing consumption will absorb the whole of the 4 million tons increase in pro-duction that we expect each year, we can only look for a further increase in fuel supplies from either the use of more oil or the import of foreign coal. There isa clear balance of payments advantage in using more oil rather than importedcoal and, now that we have great oil refineries in the United Kingdom, I am sure that our policy should turn increasingly to oil. Without deliberate action on our part, however, we cannot hope for a faster development of the use of oil than isat present going on and we should, I think, take action at points where Governmentpressure or persuasion can be exerted. For practical purposes this field is limitedat the present time to the nationalised industries railways, gas works, and power stations.15. If the railway coal-oil conversion programme, halted in 1947 owing to shortage of oil supplies, had still been operating, its extension now would havebeen one way of obtaining further supplies of coal. By providing a direct releaseof large coal, it would also have rendered unnecessary the rather complicatedprocess now proposed for the release of small coal by the power stations to bemade into briquettes for the railways. I understand, however, that the transport commission would be very reluctant to undertake a new conversion programme without a subsidy from the Exchequer to meet the new capital expenditure on oildepots and conversion of locomotives, together with the operating loss on theuse of oil, which is estimated at about  la ton of coal saved. For this reason Iwould not at this stage press that course upon the Minister of Transport.16. Thus we are left with the gas and electricity industries. I propose toask the gas industry to press on with large-scale experiments for the use of oil in place of carbonising coal. They should not need much urging, for it is increas-ingly clear that with the rising price of coal their best means of countering the
competition of oil (as well as of electricity) is by using oil themselves. By 1956the experimental plants, costing about  1 million in all, should be saving carbon-ising coal at an annual rate of nearly i million tons.17. The time is not yet ripe for any large-scale conversion of the power stations to oil, first, because at present prices oil generally involves an operatingloss of about 305\ a ton of coal saved and, secondly, because the coal is small coal and there is no point in releasing much more of it than can be briquetted into asaleable substitute for large coal. The largest quantity of coal that in the firstinstance I suggest we should seek to save by this method is 3 million tons. Oilburning to release this quantity of coal would not impose any serious burden onthe electricity industry. 1 million tons represents the coal which would otherwise have gone to a power station that is being constructed at March wood, and theEsso Company say that the proximity of Marchwood to their refinery at Fawleywould enable them to supply oil at prices competitive with coal. The company are now in direct negotiation with the B.E.A. and, unless the Minister of Housingfeels that the risk of atmospheric pollution involved is too great, arrangements could be concluded in the near future.18. The remaining 2 million tons represent the special Welsh coal to be withdrawn from power stations for briquetting, and here, too, the cost of oil willbe much the same as that of any new supplies of coal brought in from othercoalfields. To meet any strategic objections to the use of oil, I would proposethat the B.E.A. should arrange for all these stations to be &quot; dual-fired &quot; and capable of burning coal as an alternative to oil. The new capital investment of 3 to  4 millions will not be large in relation to the electricity industry&apos;s annualinvestment of  150 to  200 millions, and if the price of coal continues to rise inrelation to the price of fuel oil this may in any event prove to be a good investment.Alteration of their plans will cause some inconveniences to the B.E.A. but, if theyshould be reluctant to embark on oil-firing to this extent, I would propose torequire them to do so.19. Thus, by the greater use of oil we might by 1956 begin to be adding toour coal supplies at a rate of an extra 34 million tons of coal a year. This doesnot seem much of a result for the trouble and expense to which we should be putting the B.E.A. and the N.C.B., but marginal tonnages can be of vitalimportance,   These 3J million tons a year would enable us:  (i) to abolish domestic coal restrictions not only unpopular but alsoexpensive to run: they cost the Exchequer over  1 million a year and require the employment of 4,000 whole and part-time officials; or(ii) to add  17 millions or so to our export trade; or(iii) to meet the wishes of the Agricultural Ministers by stopping opencastworking on the best agricultural land; or(iv) to build up over eighteen months a special reserve of 5 million tons ofcoal an even smaller reserve would have prevented the coal crisis of1947, which put the unemployed figure up to 2 millions and cost thecountry  200 millions in lost exports.We shall in due course have to decide which of these courses is to be preferred,but I suggest that we defer decision until towards the end of the year, when we shallknow more of the coal outlook. The important thing now is to get on with the steps needed to use more oil.Opencast Coal20. The scale of opencast mining will inevitably be declining from 12 million tons last year to 10 millions in 1956. Moreover, the figure for 1956 is likely to bestill further reduced by the concessions that we shall be forced to make next yearwhen legislation replaces the Defence Regulations. Indeed, the opencast problems arising for this latter reason may have to be solved by the use of oil on a muchgreater scale than is at present contemplated for example, by converting loco-motives from coal to oil.21. But the Agricultural Ministers are pressing for an immediate decision about opencast, and in particular that we should forthwith ban opencast working on all first-class agricultural land. In theory this would involve a loss of \\ million tons of coal from about 1,000 acres of land in Lancashire between now and 1956.
In practice the real loss would be greater and the programme would be seriously damaged if leading contractors, such as Wimpeys and McAlpines, had to be told to clear out of Lancashire.22. The extent of this additional loss must necessarily be a matter of con-jecture, for it depends on the reaction of the contractors, many of whom would feelthey were no longer justified in spending money to maintain their machines oracquire new plant if opencast working were curtailed in this way. At the lowest Iwould estimate the additional loss on this account at about 5 per cent, of output,that is to say \ million tons a year, or \\ million tons between now and 1956 making, with the loss in Lancashire, a total loss by 1956 of 3 million tons. Butthe N.C.B. have made an independent investigation and Sir Hubert Houldsworthhas informed me that in his view the loss would not be less than 10 per cent, of output, bringing the total loss by 1956 up to 4-\ million tons.23. Even the lower figure of 3 million tons would be a serious matter, for toreplace it we should need to import 3 million tons of coal costing at present prices 20 millions. Surely an import figure of  20 millions is out of all proportion to theagricultural value of the 1,000 acres or so in Lancashire that we are now con-sidering? For these reasons I hope that the Cabinet will agree that there should at the present time be no further ban on opencast working.Conclusions24. After prolonged consideration and discussion with the nationalised fuel and power industries, I am convinced that we cannot reasonably expect coal production to increase in the short term at a faster rate than consumption is rising,namely 4 million tons a year. Thus, apart from regular imports of coal, there is no practicable short-term way of relieving the stringency of the coal situation except by injecting more oil into our fuel economy. We must choose either to adopt thisoil policy or to continue the previous Governments policy of drift. There is nothird possibility for the next few years.25. Accordingly I propose, if the Cabinet approve, that the following stepsbe taken:  (i) The N.C.B. to be required to build the plant needed to make another2 million tons of railway briquettes from small coal.(ii) The Gas Industry to be asked to press on with large-scale experiments inthe use of oil in place of carbonising coal.(iii) The B.E.A. to be required, first, to arrange for oil-firing at Marchwood(subject to consideration of the risk of atmospheric pollution); secondly,to release for the manufacture of briquettes the special qualities of welsh coal used at the power stations; and, thirdly, to convert thosestations to dual-firing with oil or coal.(iv) If the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Housing agree, theintroduction this summer of a small subsidy for one year on improvedgrates installed in &quot; foggy &quot; areas.26.   In the light of progress made with these plans, we might consider furtherbefore the end of the year what priority should be given to our various objectives:the increase of exports, the abolition of home restrictions, the relaxation of open-cast mining and the establishment of a special coal reserve.G.L.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W. 1,14th May, 1954.
