confidnetial cabinet OFFICE /^NC(54) 180 record COPY       COPY NO-M29th May, 1954CABINETTHE RATE OF HOUSING SUBSIDIESMemorandum by the Minister of housing and Local GovernmentG. (54) 111 (&quot;Operation Round-up&quot;), which is now underconsideration by a Cabinet Committee, includes proposals for an alteration of the structure of housing subsidies.    These are long-term proposals which will involve legislation.   However, the recent alteration in monetary rates and a probable further reduction in the rate of interest on loans to local authorities from the Public Works Loan Board, whichthe Chancellor of the Exchequer is considering will warrant a general reduction of the rates of the various housing subsidies.2. Such a general reduction can be made by Order laid in draft and requiring affirmative resolution of the House of Commons, afterconsultation with the local authorities.    The opportunity is timely becausethe subsidies are reviewed annually in a White Paper which is presented to Parliament on 30th June.3. The present general standard subsidy is  26. 14. 0.     If, when this figure was settled in 1952, the rate of interest had been 3f per cent(the probable new rate), and not 4^ per cent, the figure would have been 21., 18. 0.    Account must now be taken of changes in building prices,of the average size of Council houses and of earnings.    But I hope in thenegotiations to secure a rate of  22. 1.0. or thereabouts, and in any eventnot higher than  24, with corresponding reductions in the other subsidies.4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer concurs.5.   , I shall be glad to have authority to proceed on these lines.H.M.Ministry of Housing and Local Government,S.W.1. ,28th May, 1954.
