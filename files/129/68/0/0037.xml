Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1954SECRETC. (54) 1873rd June, 1954CABINET office Copy No.    7RECORD COPYCABINETEGYPTMemorandum by the Minister of state decision on the future of the Canal Zone is urgently needed. We mustredeploy our troops. Commitments elsewhere (and the general need for drasticeconomies) make a rapid and large reduction of expenditure in the Canal Zoneessential.2. The Egyptian Government appear to have their domestic situation inhand and to be anxious to reach agreement with us. They are probably as satis-factory from our point of view as any possible alternative. But, if we wait too long before reopening discussions, the Egyptian Government may be unable toprevent such a deterioration in the situation in the Canal Zone as would make a resumption of negotiations impossible. The situation had considerably improveduntil the incidents of 29th and 30th May. The Egyptian Government have been told that the future will be governed by the extent to which they co-operate intracing and punishing the criminals.3. At our request the United States Government are withholding economicand military aid. They will probably be unwilling to go on doing so much longer,particularly as the funds earmarked for Egypt will disappear on 30th June, theend of the United States financial year, unless Congress renews them.4. There appear to be two ways in which negotiations might be resumedwith some prospect of progress.The first would be to continue discussions on the existing scheme for usingservice technicians to maintain the base, but to agree that they shall not wearuniform in exchange for the Egyptians agreeing to include Turkey in the available-bility clause and provided that satisfactory arrangements are made regarding thestatus of the technicians.The second would be to suggest the maintenance of the base by a civilianorganisation, with American participation in some form, in return for the grantby the Egyptians of a longer period for the withdrawal of our troops and a longer period of availability. This was the suggestion which the Cabinet invited theForeign Office to explore, in consultation with the Americans, on 22nd March(C.C. (54) 21st Conclusions, Minute 2).5. The advantage of the first course is that some progress has already beenmade with the Egyptians and that we have good reason to believe that they areprepared to include Turkey in the availability clause, if we will not insist onuniforms. The disadvantages are that, although we might agree Heads of Agree-ment, we would probably have considerable trouble in working out the details and, in particular, in securing satisfactory immunities for our technicians. we might be held in this country to have given away under Egyptian pressure theright of The Queen&apos;s soldiers to wear The Queen&apos;s uniform.6. As regards the second course, proposals were worked out in some detail and submitted to the Americans, who replied that they regarded the plan favour-ably and would be willing to participate in working out a solution of this kindif invited by the Egyptians. They cannot, however, guarantee the participation of46248
2American firms. The Secretary of State for War has also had some consultations with British industrialists. Their reply showed that they consider the scheme tobe on the whole practicable, though full of difficulties. They made it clear thatthey would only participate if appealed to at the highest level. The scheme wouldbe very expensive if the installations were to be maintained on any considerable scale. But it has considerable merits, in that it avoids the deadlock on uniformsand the need to use military personnel whose status may be insufficientlyprotected.7. In my view the question of what is actually maintained in the base is nolonger of the first importance. The essential thing is to ensure that when we leaveEgypt we do so with an agreement which gives us the right for an adequate period to return in war. Our prestige throughout the Middle East would be seriously affected if we failed to secure this right. A civilian contract scheme on a large scale would be very expensive. In the light of the above considerations I thereforethink that our aim should be to maintain, for as long as possible, by civilian labour,a minimum form of nucleus base and to secure a satisfactory agreement on avail-ability in war. On that basis we could secure a very considerable saving in money.8.   The main points of such an agreement would be as follows:  (i) Complete removal of our troops from Egypt within about two years.(ii) The right to return if an attack is made on the Arab States or Turkey.It would be good if Persia could be included in the formula as well,but we should not insist on this. We should try to secure this right for as long as possible, and certainly for considerably longer than seven years.(iii) The removal or sale of the stores in the base within about two years(except what may be required under (iv) below).(iv) Maintenance by civilian contractors (of British or any other nationality),subject to British inspection of certain minimum facilities such as:  (a) one or more airfields (to include Abu Sueir), where we must alsosecure the staying rights in peace-time which we need;(b) some road and port facilities;(c) a few essential installations on a care-and-maintenance basis.The contractors would be under contract to the Egyptian or british governments, and maintenance would be paid for wholly, or in part,by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.(v) We should still desire the association of the United States Government insome way with the arrangement. For instance, the acceptance of anarrangement on the above lines by the Egyptians might be made acondition precedent to the grant of United States aid to Egypt.9. On his return the Foreign Secretary will want to raise these mattersurgently. I am therefore submitting this paper now for consideration by membersof the Cabinet.S.L.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,1st June, 1954.
