secret cabinet OFFICE /,c(54) 172 RECORD COPY copy no. 6 25th May, 1954CABINETAIR OPERATIONS IN KENYAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the Kenya authorities wish to extend the scope of their air opera-tions.    Air attacks on Mau Mau terrorists in the prohibited areas in Kenyahave been carried out by Piper Pacer and Harvard aircraft since April,1953, and by Lincoln bombers since November, 1953.    A flight of Vampireaircraft fitted with rockets and 20 mm. cannon was also used during april, 1954.2.        At the end of last December, General Srskine reported that thecontinued employment of air forces in Kenya was justified as they were theonly effective weapon available for attacking certain important targets inthe forests.    Their withdrawal would leave comparatively safe areas forgang hide-outs and would have an adverse effect on the morale of security forces and civilians.3.        The use of these aircraft has been defended in Parliament on thegrounds:-(a) that aerial attack is Confined to the Prohibited Areas, mainly the Aberdare and Mount Kenya forests, which are well-knownzones and which cannot be entered without a permit;  therisk to &quot;innocent&quot; persons is therefore negligible;(b) that only clearly identified and specific targets areattacked;  and(c) that operations are authorised by G. H. Q. , East AfricaCommand.4.        General Erskine and the Acting Governor of Kenya now recommendthat Piper Pacer and Harvard aircraft should be permitted to drop small2 0 lb. anti-personnel bombs in close support of security forces outside theProhibited Areas.&apos;    I append a copy of a telegram from the ActingGovernor on the subject.5.        The main reasons for this proposal are:-(a)    terrorist gangs in the reserves have gone to earth in comparatively small areas of wooded or thick country which it is difficult to penetrate on foot without sufferingcasualties;(b)although terrorists can be spotted from the air it is not easy to direct fire from the ground on to them;
(c) gangs have been able to lie up and eventually disperse andmany opportunities to inflict casualties on them haveconsequently been missed;(d) the present restrictions benefit terrorists and result inneedless casualties to security forces and home guards.6.        Bombing would only be undertaken at the request of theCommander on the ground and no bombing would take place if there was any foreseeable danger of injury to innocent persons.    There is little difference in principle between the use of mortars (which are alreadypermitted) and the use of small anti-personnel bombs.7.        The Secretary of State for &quot;War and the Secretary of State forAir (who has consulted the Air Officers Commanding Middle East andAden) are in agreement with the proposals.     The latter would stipulate that air action should only be undertaken at the request of the Commanderon the ground when in contact with the target.8.        There is little doubt that the use of light aircraft to drop 20 lb.bombs on terrorist gangs outside the Prohibited Areas will be attacked by certain Members of Parliament, especially if there is any unfortunateaccident in which members of the security forces or the civilian population are injured.    On the other hand we know from interrogation of &quot;GeneralChina&quot; that the terrorists are aware of the present restrictions anddeliberately take refuge in the Reserves in order to avoid being bombed.9.        I think we should authorise the Kenya authorities to go ahead onthe understanding that we shall review the decision in, say, three months1time in the light of the results achieved.    I should be glad to know whethermy colleagues agree.O.L.Colonial Office, S. W. 1.24th May, 1954.APPENDIXTELEGRAM DATED 24TH APRIL. 1954. FROM the acting GOVERNOR OF KENYA TO THESECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIESAir Action Against Terrorists.Hitherto aerial attack on terrorist targets has been confined toprohibited areas.2.        There has been a trend in recent operations for large gangs tomove about the reserve comparatively openly.    As a result of groundforces1 action these gangs have frequently gone to earth in comparatively small areas of wooded or thick country in special areas which it is
68&apos;difficult to penetrate on foot without suffering casualties.    Action inwhich Lord Wavell was killed was case in point.    In these fircumstancesmortar fire is permissible but not always successful.    Terroristscan usually be spotted but it is not easy to direct fire from the ground onto them.    Commander-in-Chief considers we are missing many goodtargets by not bombing them from the air.3.        Legal view here is that, on the principle that reasonable forcemay be used to repel force, and having regard to the fact that aircraft are increasingly being shot by terrorists, aerial attacks on terroristsas in paragraph 4 would be justified providing:-(a) terrorist target can be identified with virtualcertainty;(b) the effect of attack can with virtual certaintybe confined to the terrorist target;  and(c) the force used is the minimum required to achieve the object of the operation.4.        War Council has strongly recommended that in the circumstances described above in non-prohibited areas we should be permitted to dropsmall 20 lb. anti-personnel bombs from the air.    We propose that thisbombing should be confined to:-(a) light aircraft (Pacers) which fly slowly, carryingfour 20 lb. bombs each, and can place their bombswith extreme accuracy;  and(b) Harvards which have the same characteristics butcarry eight 20 lb. bombs and are armed with one machine gun.    We do not recommend that Harvardsshould be authorised to use their guns.5.        Air action would only be undertaken at the request of theCommander on the ground and no bombing would take place if there were any foreseeable danger of injury to innocent persons.    We feel thatsuch use of small anti-personnel bombs is in no way different from theuse of mortars.    Present restrictions benefit terrorists and result inneedless casualties to Security Force and loyalists.6.        I shall be grateful for your agreement to this proposal.
