COST OF LIVING ALLOWANCE FOR INDUSTRIAL workers at GIBRALTARMemorandum by the First Lord of the AdmiraltyLiving conditions in Spain are not the same as living conditions in gibraltar which has long had the advantage of being part of the BritishCommonwealths,    The Spaniards we are talking about live in Spain but workin Gibraltar.    It is Spain - not Gibraltar - which settles the pattern oftheii&quot; domestic existence.    We do not accept the statement that it costs the Spanish workmen as much to live as it does those in Gibraltar.    the spaniards can buy in whatever market is cheaper whether in Spain orGibraltar.    The Spaniards undoubtedly get local produce cheaper in Spainthan it can be obtained in Gibraltar.    Furthermore there is no doubt thatthe standard and cost of housing is appreciably higher in Gibraltar.2.        If we give way on this there is no doubt that the Spaniards will beable to live at a higher standard than Gibraltarians.    The Spanish manipula-tion of the exchange rate alone ensures this.    Goods coming into Gibraltarfrom Spain have to be paid for at a higher rate than the ordinary rate forexchanging pesetas.    But there are other things as well.    When theGibraltarians find themselves worse off than the Spaniards over the borderthey will feel themselves shabbily treated unless they get an extra allowance.Then all the fuss about discrimination would be started up again.3.        The Colonial Office do not define the principle they are invoking.They seem to hold that in no circumstances should any local entrants getless for the same work than any other employed in the same place.    Infact, however, in the peculiar circumstances of Gibraltar there are tworates to be considered., the Spanish rate and the Gibraltarian rate.    Therecan be nothing wrong in paying Spanish rates to the workers who live in spain.    The positive evidence that we are not undercutting the Spanishrate lies in the situation described in the report received in 1950 when wewere told that &quot;our Vice-Consulate in La Linea is beseiged by Spanishworkers wishing to obtain employment in Gibraltar&quot;.4.        When the Foreign Office and Colonial Office raised this with ministers we were ready to put forward a compromise.    Prices in Spainhave gone up recently and no one will say that 24/- a week is exactly theright difference.    We were going to suggest the Spaniards should get 9/&quot;a week more, making the difference 15/&quot;* a week.5.        Whatever is decided, surely nothing should be said till after the queen&apos;s visit.    First, it cannot appear as anything except appeasement.    IfWe are blackmailed by Spain into giving way on one issue another will soon-1-fjj        c^idej^ CABINET OFFICE K/c. (54) 156 RECORD COPY copy no.29th April, 1954cabinet
