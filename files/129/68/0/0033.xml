I have discussed the Report with my colleagues who are members of the Crichel Down Committee and I set out our views.The Future of Crichel Down3. The Home Secretary is submitting separately a paper(C. (54) 182) on future policy for the disposal of land acquired compulsorilyfor public purposes.    This paper recommends that previous owners(and certain successors in title) should be given an opportunity of. buyingback their land;  but that this should not apply retrospectively.    In thecase of the Crichel Down land, the decision to sell it to Crown Lands wastaken twelve months ago, and a tenant has been in occupation since lastMichaelmas and has a legal right to remain.    We can only sell the landback if the tenant is willing to give up his tenancy, receiving reasonable,compensation.    All the indications so far are that he would be unwilling to do this,4. In the circumstances, my colleagues and I consider thatthe present position cannot be disturbed.Commander and the Hon. Mrs. Marten&apos;s Costs5. Counsel for Commander and Mrs. Marten asked at theEnquiry,that their costs should be refunded to them and in his ReportSir Andrew Clark says that Commander Marten was fully justified in thecircumstances in pressing for a Public Enquiry.6.      ,      The payment of Commander and Mrs. Marten1 s costs would,help to counter any accusation that they were being unfairly treated, ifthe land was not returned to them.    On the other hand, there is noprecedent for the payment of costs;  an undesirable precedent would be created; and to pay costs might suggest that they had established amoral claim.    Their Solicitors were told beforehand that there was no provision for the payment of costs. * &apos;. 7. The costs would probably be of the order of  3,000 to  4,000.-1-
8. I have told the House of Commons that I expected to.publish &apos;.&apos;the Report shortly; and; in reply to a Supplementary Question, thatI hoped very much that it would be before Whitsun.    There has also.beena demand for a Debate on Friday morning on the assumption&apos; that theReport would be published on Thursday.-. 9. . My colleagues and I consider that a short Debate so soon after,the publication of the Report would not satisfy the Housed    In order toavoid two Debates, we consider that the best course would be to publish the Report on the day the House resumes (15th June) and to arrange a  -Debate as soon as possible thereafter, in the course of which I could makethe proposed statement about future policy and also announce our decisionon the Crichel Down land. -10. The Report is in some respects inaccurate and is regarded bya dumber of those criticised as unfair to them.    The criticisms of theAgricultural Land Commission are particularly severe.    We agreed thatwhen announcing in the House the publication of the Report I should makea brief statement on the lines of the attached draft.V T..L.D.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries,s.w.i. .        ; s31st May, 1954. ... &apos; ;&apos;   draft statement by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries&apos; Sir Andrew Clark&apos;s Report on the Crichel Down Enquiry is published.to-day and is now available in the Vote Office.-&apos; -        -Sir Andrew Clark states in Conclusion 25 of his Report that&quot;there was no trace in this case of anything in the nature of bribery,corruption or personal dishonesty&quot;.    The Enquiry has thus achieved mymain purpose,-which was to deal with any rumours-and suggestions ofthis kind. , f  .      .   &apos;The Report contains criticisms of the actions and conduct ofthe Agricultural Land Commission and of a number of individuals.    So faras those criticised are persons (and most of them are) for whose conductlam answerable as.a Minister of the Crown, the responsibility rests with me.    That responsibility I wholly accept.I have naturally given to those who are criticised anopportunity of commenting on those parts1 of the Report which referred tothem.    Having read the comments and explanations I have received, i must in fairness say that I have formed a more favourable view of the actions taken by the officers concerned than appears in the Report.I do not, of course, dispute that mistakes ^nd errors of judgment weremade;  and steps have been taken, so far as possible, to see that these donot happen again.    In view of the nature of the errors themselves and of
Phe public ,way in which, they have been exposed, I am satisfied that nofurther action by me in relation to them is necessary or would be appropriate..    I continue to have full confidence in the Agricultural HandCommission.,   ,The Government will shortly make a statement on thedisposal of the land in question at Crichel Down, and also a statement ofgeneral policy on the disposal of land purchased c,ompulsorily for. public purposes. .- The Government are most grateful to Sir Andrew Clark for ,his valuable services in conducting the Enquiry, without fee. ;     -   -

To The Right Honourable Sir Thomas Dugdale, Bt, M.P.Sir,I was appointed by you on 6th November, 1953, with the following termsof reference:  &quot;To enquire into the procedure adopted (a) in reaching the decision that land at Crichel Down should ibe sold to the Commissioners of crown lands; (b) in the selection of a tenant by them; and the circumstances,in which those decisions were made, but excluding from the enquiry all questions of governmental policy and, in particular, any question of whether preferential treatment should have been given to any applicanton the ground of previous ownership or occupation of the land.&quot;I have now the honour to submit my Report which I propose to divideinto two Parts:1. Factual Narrative.2. Conclusions.2. In accordance with my terms of reference I duly held a Public Inquiryat the Corn Exchange, Blandford, into the circumstances in which it wasidecided to sell 725 acres of land at Crichel Down to the Commissioners offCrown Lands and the procedure adopted in coming to such decision, andalso into the method adopted in selecting a tenant for the land and the circum-stances surrounding such selection. The Inquiry opened at 10.30 a.m. onWednesday, 21st April, and the hearing lasted for 7 working days, ending at p.m. on Wednesday, 28th April.3. I heard the oral evidence of 28 witnesses and examined in detail alarge number of letters, minutes and other documents. A list of the witnessesis set out at Annexures 1 and 2-to this Report. I am satisfied flhat all relevantdocuments were fully disclosed and that (with two exceptions hereinaftermentioned) all persons who could have materially assisted me in the Inquirywere present and gave evidence before me.Having heard the evidence and examined the documents I find the factsto be as follows: -1. FACTUAL NARRATIVE4. In or about the year 1937 some 725 acres of land at Crichel Down inthe County of Dorset (hereinafter called &quot; Crichel Down &quot;) were compulsorily acquired by the Air Ministry for use as a bombing range at a total costto the Government of  12,106 including compensation for injurious affection.5. At the time of such acquisition 328 acres (hereinafter called the&quot;Crichel Area&quot;) formed part of a farm on the late Lord Alington&apos;s CrichelEstate which at all material times was occupied by Mr. Robin Harding andhis nephew Mr. John Harding (hereinafter called &quot; the Hardings&quot;) astenant farmers. 382 acres (hereinafter called &quot; the Strange Area &quot;) formed part of Mr. Farquharson&apos;s Langton Estate and were being farmed as partof Launceston Farm which was originally occupied by Mr. Jim Strange andhis brother as tenant farmers, and was later purchased by them when theLangton Estate was broken up in 1940. The remaining 15 acres (hereinafter called &quot; the Hooper Area &quot;) were owned and farmed by the late Mr. Hooperas part of Manor Farm which is at present owned by the Trustees of hiswill and farmed by his son Mr. Hugh Hooper.  At that time approximately
114 acres of the Crichel Area, 56 acres of the Strange Area and the wholeof the Hooper area were under cultivation. The remainder of Crichel Downwas typical chalk downland used mainly for sheep grazing.6. After the land was acquired by the Air Ministry cultivation necessarilyceased and the land deteriorated rapidly becoming covered in places withgorse and infested with rabbits.7. After the War Crichel Down ceased to be used as a bombing range and in 1949 it was decided that the Air Ministry no longer required to retainit. It was then decided that the land should be transferred to the Ministrypursuant to Section 88 of the Agriculture Act, 1947. The requisite order under that Section formally transferring the land to the Ministry was neverin fact made ; but in anticipation that such order would be made in due course the Ministry assumed the control and management of Crichel Downin January 1950.8. The Ministry in accordance with normal practice handed over themanagement of Crichel Down to the Agricultural Land Commission (herein-after called &quot; the Land Commission&quot;), a body corporate established bySection 68 of the Agriculture Act, 1947 for the express (purposes of managingand farming land vested in the Ministry. The Land Commission have no power to buy or sell land, but may grant tenancies which are not normallyto be more than a year to year tenancy. Although the Land commission was responsible for the management of the land, they in fact were advised byand carried out their executive functions through the medium of the LandsService. The Lands Service is an integral part of the Ministry, to which itacts as technical advisers and its officers are all civil servants. In this case,the Lands Service in turn carried out their executive functions through the medium of the Dorset Agricultural Executive Committee (hereinafter called&quot; the Agricultural Committee &quot;).9. Some confusion is liable to be caused between the Land Commissionand the Lands Service by reason of the fact that officers of the Lands service are called Land Commissioners. To avoid this I refer to them hereinafter;as &quot; Land Service Officers &quot;.10. In December, 1949, Colonel Norton-Fagge (who was tlhe Land ServiceOfficer for Somerset and Dorset), anticipating the handing over of crichel down to the Ministry, wrote to the Dorset County Agricultural Officer, aMr. Ferris, asking for advice as to how the land should be dealt with.On 10th December 1949 Mr. Ferris replied stating that he was fairly certainthat each of the farmers who had previously farmed Crichel Down would be willing to take over the parts formerly attached to their respective farms and work the land. Mr. Ferris went on to say that he was quite sure that thiswould be a better method of dealing with the land than by attempting tofarm it as one holding. In March 1950 the Agent for the Crichel Estatewrote to the Ministry asking for an opportunity to negotiate for crichel down if it should be for sale, and Colonel Norton-Fagge replied that it wasnot then possible to give any definite reply. On the 1st April, 1950, theMinister made an Order under Section 68 of the Agriculture Aot, 1947,placing Crichel Down under the control of the Land Commission. At this time part of the land was being cultivated by the Hardings and also by Mr.Strange under some nebulous arrangement with the Air Ministry, but theyhad no tenancy and paid no rent. The land had no water supply of itsown, but water was obtained; under a licence from the Crichel Estate fromthe Estate reservoir.
11. Early in May, 1950, Colonel Norton-Fagge inspected Crichel Downaccompanied by his immediate superior, Mr. Hole, who was the ProvincialChief Officer of the Lands Service. As a result of this inspection ColonelNorton-Fagge made a written report which was sent to the Land Commission.In this report Colonel Norton-Fagge suggested three possible ways of dealingwith the land, namely : (a) By letting in blocks to neighbouring farmers.(b) By division into two or more independent fully equipped holdings.(c) By the formation of a single fully equipped holding.He discarded (b) as being unsuitable and economically unsound, and therecan be no doubt that he was right in so doing. He advised, contrary to theview previously expressed by Mr. Ferris, that (c) would be the best solution,and estimated the cost of equipping the land at  18,500, and that soequipped a rent of  2 per acre should be readily obtainable. He stated thatthe objection to (a) was that the adjoining farmers might be disinclinedto deal satisfactorily with the centre of the land; when&apos; cross-examined asto this he admitted that it was pure guesswork on his part and not basedon any information he had received or any enquiries he had made. Heiagreed that the farmers concerned were all first class farmers. He wenton to make recommendations as to temporary arrangements for reclamationand cropping, pending equipment of the land as a single unit which were infact substantially implemented. There are no material inaccuracies in thefacts set out in this report, save that the value of the land was placed at 7,500, as to which see later. The whole report was expressly subject to satisfactory arrangements being made for an adequate supply of water. Thiswas in fact subsequently obtained by agreement with the Crichel Estate whoprovided a water supply from the estate reservoir.12. On 20th June, 1950, the Land Commission resolved that one of their members, Mr. Bourke, should inspect Crichel Down as soon as possible.Mr. Bourke duly visited Crichel Down on 11th August, 1950, and reported inwriting to the Land Commission. He recommended that the agricultural committee should farm the land and carry out reclamation work untilMichaelmas, 1951, and that thereafter the land should Ibe equipped as asingle unit and let. He stated that he had discussed the matter with ColonelNorton-Fagge and considered the proposals in his report to be quite sound and adequate and recommended that they be adopted. He placed theestimated cost of equipment at  20,000, and the value of the land at  7,500.He estimated the rent obtainable at 35s. per acre which, he said, after allowing for depreciation and repairs would show a net return of 1\ per cent,on capital outlay. When cross-examined as to the value of the land he admitted that he did not know where he had got the figure of  7,500 from,and that it was nothing more than a rough guess. In fact it was a merearbitrary figure which appeared in the Ministry books for audit purposes and had been repeated in Colonel Norton-Fagge&apos;s report. It is clear fromthe evidence before me that the true value of the land unequipped andunrestricted was at least  20,000. Even apart from this mistake, however,it should have been clear even at this stage that from a purely financial aspect the proposal to equip Crichel Down as a single unit was probablyunsound.13. On 16th August, 1950, the Land Commission formally resolved thatthe proposals to equip Orichel Down as a single unit, subject to slightmodification, be approved in principle. The next day Mr. Edwards, whowas the Chief Technical Officer to the Land Commission, wrote to Colonel
JSlorton-Fagge notifying ihim of the decision and stating that the economics&apos;of &apos;Uhe proposal did not show up very well,, even at a rent of 35s. to 40s.per acre.14. By October, 1950, the Land Commission^ proposals for dealing withCrichel Down began to be known in the neighbourhood and from tlhenonwards applications were received from time to time by the Lands Service,either direct or through the Agricultural Committee, from a number of farmers desirous of being considered as tenants. Among the earliest appli-cants was a Mr. C. T. Tozer, a member of a well known farming familyat Woodyates, with whom I shall have to deal more fully later in thisreport. There were some 13 or 14 applicants in all, and the Lands Serviceacting as agents for the Land Commission, answered them all in more orless similar form, stating that the property was not at that time being offered to let but their names had been recorded and that as soon as theproperty was available for letting they   would be sent panticulars; the tenancy it was stated would be advertised for tender in the public Press andany application they   might then make would be carefully considered. Amongthe applicants was a Captain D. W. Taylor, who offered to rent the land aisit was and erect any necessary buildings himself.15. On 28th August, 1951, Mr. ILofthouse, who toad succeeded ColonelNorton-Fagge as Land Service Officer for Somerset and Dorset, wrote toMr. Hole pointing out that the water supply was then secure (an agreement for water supply had in fact been entered into with the Criohel Estate inJune 1951) and saying that all now seemed ready to advertise for a tenantand asking for authority to proceed. To this Mr. Hole replied that theChairman of the Land Commission, Sir Frederick Burrows, considered the farming of Crichel Down by the Agricultural Committee was very satisfactory,and that Mr. Edwards felt that the decision to advertise should be deferred for the time being. In September Mr. OLofthouse wrote to one of the applicants stating &quot; I have on record a great many persons who are definitelyinterested and must be given an opportunity to make an offer. ... I regret-therefore that I must not negotiate with you in advance of any of the otheroffers &quot;.16. On 31st October, 1951, a full dress inspection of Crichel Down bythe Land Commission took place. Sir Frederick Burrows (the Chairman),Mr. Watson Jones (a member), Mr. Edwards (Chief Technical Officer and land Agent) and Mr. Smith (Secretary) were present as representing theLand Commission, and were accompanied by Mr. Ferris, Mr. Hole, Mr.Lofthouse and other officers of the Lands Service in an advisory capacity.The arrangements for equipping Crichel Down as a single self-contained unitwere then settled and it was agreed that certain local farmers, includingthe Hardings, should be, and subsequently they in fact were, consulted asto the details of siting the buildings and of the necessary equipment generally.It was also decided that the Agricultural Committee should continue tofarm the land until Michaelmas, 1952, as from which date the tenancy shouldbe offered for tender.17. On 25th May, 1952, Captain Taylor wrote to Mr. Lofthouse makinga firm offer to rent Crichel Down unequipped as it then stood at a rentalof  2,000 per annum (i.e. approximately  3 per acre) subject to reviewevery three years with adjustment for provision by the Land Commission ofany buildings or other assets and in the light of then existing conditions.From a purely financial point of view this was in marked contrast to andon the face of it appeared considerably more attractive than the Land Com-:mission&apos;s proposal to spend approximately  20,000 in equipping the land
with a view to obtaining a rental after it had been equipped of  2 per acre(i.e. approximately  1,400).18. It is a little strange to see the way in which this offer was dealt with.On 5th June, 1952, Mr. Loftihouse forwarded Captain Taylor&apos;s letter toMr. Hole with a covering letter in which he stated that as it was a seriousoffer he felt bound to put it up, but recommended adhering to the originalplan. On 13th June, 1952, Mr. Hole forwarded Captain Taylor&apos;-s letter tothe Land Commission with a covering letter asking them to confirm that theCommission had no intention of letting without first equipping the land,and strongly recommending them NOT to do so. On 20&apos;th June, 1952, theLand Commission replied that they were not prepared to let the land withoutequipment, and Captain Taylor&apos;s offer was duly turned down.19. There was some suggestion both in the correspondence and in theevidence that Captain Taylor would not have been a satisfactory tenant inany event, but it was clear that the real reason for turning down hisapplication was that it had already been decided as a matter of policy thatit was desirable in the interests of food production to equip Criohel Downas a single self contained unit before letting it, and accordingly, as sir frederick Burrows himself stated, Captain Taylor&apos;s offer was never given anyserious consideration. Meanwhile on 26th May, 1952, the Agent to theCrichel Estate, Major Seymour, wrote to Mr. Lofthouse referring to theprevious letter from the Crichel Estate of 24th March, 1950, asking forinformation as to the present situation and asking whether it would bepossible to buy back the Crichel Area in order that it might be restored tothe Hardings&apos; farm to which it originally belonged and of which he contendedit formed an important integral part.20. Mr. Lofthouse forwarded the letter to Mr. Hole with a covering letter in which he stated that he had heard that the Oriehel Estate would be willingto purchase the whole of Criohel Down. He stated his belief (which theevidence showed to be correct) that the Estate intended to add any land aquired to the Hardings&apos; farm, and that no fixed equipment would benecessary as existing buildings would be adequate. He further stated thatthe Hardings were first class farmers and there was no doubt that if theland was sold to the Crichel Estate it would be well farmed. The evidenceshowed that this view was fully justified. Mr. Hole forwarded both letters to the Land Commission under a covering letter stating that he had not gone into the merits of the proposition as he imagined the Commission would not wish to recommend the Minister to sell the property. Mr. Edwards statedin evidence that he never pursued the matter any further as he thought theMinistry had no power to sell land. Sir Frederick Burrows stated in evidencethat the proposial was never investigated or considered, presumably for &apos;thesame reason.21. It appears difficult at first sight to see how such a misconception couldever have arisen in view of the provisions of Section 90 of the agriculture act, 1947, which expressly empowers the Minister (inter alia) to sell any land acquired by him in such manner as he may think expedient for thepurpose for which the land was acquired (in this case, of course, agriculture)and for any other purpose provided it appears to him expedient so to dohaving regard to the use proposed to be made of the land. It had, however,been the fixed policy of the Socialist Government never to sell any land that had been acquired by the Government, whether compulsorily or otherwise,except under very special circumstances, and presumably this policy had become so firmly established that many civil servants were under the impres-sion that there was no power to sell., No notification of any change in this
policy was received by any of the permanent staff of the Ministry until sometime in the summer of 1952, when, according to the evidence of Sir ReginaldFranklin, the Minister first expressed his view that if possible a number of properties acquired by the Ministry ought to be sold. Then for some reason,which I find it difficult to understand in f ace of the unusually clear wording OfSection 90 of the Agriculture Act, 1947, which I should have thought made it plain (not only to a lawyer but to any intelligent layman) that the minister had a complete discretion to sell any land which he had acquired if he came to the conclusion that it was expedient so to do, the Minister was advised by the legal department of the Ministry that there were grave doubts whether he had any power to sell land acquired by him. As a result of this advice the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown was obtained on thisquestion ; but it was not until November, 1952, that their opinion wasreceived, stating clearly that the Minister had the requisite power..22. On 10th June, 1952, Mr. Smith, the Secretary to the Land Commission,replied to Major Seymour&apos;s letter of 26th May, stating that it had beendecided to equip Crichel Down as a single self-contained unit and when this had been done to advertise it for letting in accordance with the usual practice.  Mr. Smith went on to say that although the management of CriohelDown had become the responsibility of the Land Commission, the freeholdwas still owned by the Air Ministry and so far as the Commission were awarethere was no intention of transferring it to the Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries.  How Mr. Smith (and presumably the members of the land commission) could have been in complete ignorance of the decision totransfer Crichel Down to the Ministry, especially in view of the Order of theMinister dated 1st April, 1950, vesting &quot;the management of the land in theLand Commission under Section&apos; 68 (1) (a) of the Agriculture Act, 1947,as being land vested in the Minister or for the management or farming ofwhich he had become responsible, is again difficult to appreciate.   Un-fortunately Mr. Smith is abroad and was unable to attend the Inquiry toexplain this and other matters.   As a result of this letter Lieut. CommanderMarten (whose wife had succeeded to-the Crichel Estate on the death ofher father Lord Alington) wrote to Mr. Crouch, the Member of parliament for the Wimborne Division of Dorset, asking him to take up the matter with the Minister on his behalf, pointing out that the Crichel Area hadbeen compulsorily acquired from Lord Alington, that it formed an important and integral part of one of the farms on the Crichel Estate, and setting out his objections to the proposals to equip and let Crichel Down as a singleself-contained unit.   On 13th June, 1952, Mr. Crouch forwarded Lieut.Commander  Marten&apos;s  letter  to  Mr.   Nugent,   Parliamentary   Secretary(Commons) to the Minister.   As a result Mr. Nugent directed that a report should be obtained from the Land Commission as to the desirability of selling the Crichel Area back to the Crichel Estate, he, of course, being thenaware from Lieut. Commander Marten&apos;s letter that this area had been acquired under compulsory powers.23. On 14th July, Mr. Payne, an Assistant Secretary at the Ministry, wrote to Mr. Smith asking for the necessary report. It further appears from his letter that Mr. Nugenfs private secretary had sent direct to Mr. Smith the correspondence with Mr. Crouch and Lieut. Commander Marten, so thatMr. Smith must also have been aware that the Crichel Area had been acquired under compulsory powers.24. On 15th July, 1952, Mir. Smith Wrote to Mr. Hole calling for the requisite report and saying &quot; I think what the Commission must do is togive the Minister a considered opinion on the whole question of sale versus
equipment as one unit&quot;. He also asked for a plan showing the previousownerships of Crichel Down, and information as to what sort of people theprevious owners are &quot; and (if you are able to form a view without approach-ing the people concerned) whether they would be willing and able to buyback their various portions &quot;. Mr. Hole passed this on to Mr. Lofthouseto report. In his letter he asked Mr. Lofthouse to &quot; obtain all furtherinformation you can without, of course, approaching the various owners&quot;.This it will be noted is an extension of the ban on approaching previousowners originally imposed by Mr. Smith. Mr. Hole also expressly directedMr. Lofthouse &quot; to obtain from the Air Ministry Land Agent informationas to whether the land was purchased voluntarily or compulsorily &quot;.25. Mr. Lofthouse was about to go on leave and handed over the matter to a young and comparatively inexperienced subordinate, Mr. Brown, with instructions to prepare the necessary report. The instructions given by Mr.Lofthouse to Mr. Brown were, according to the evidence given by Mr. Brown,which I entirely accept, somewhat extraordinary in the circumstances. Mr.Brown was told (for no apparent reason) that &quot; the job was extremely con-fldential &quot; and that on no account was he to approach the Hardings or anyof the previous owners or anyone else connected with the land. He wasalso&apos; forbidden to inspect the Hardings&apos; land or anybody else&apos;s holding, andwas to rely exclusively on such information as he &quot; could get from the officeorganisation &quot;. In this respect he was further told only to consult Mr. Ferris,and any further information was only to be obtained from the office files.In fact no office files were available to him except the Agricultural Committeefile (which when produced and examined contained nothing of any relevanceto his subsequent report) and certain farm survey statistics of the variousfarmers in the neighbourhood. He was never told to consult the AirMinistry Land Agent as to whether the purchase had been voluntary or compulsory and was never shown Mr. Hole&apos;s letter to Mr. Lofthouse inwhich such inquiry was directed. This is all the more strange since he wassupplied with Mr. SmitiYs letter to Mr. Hole. This was the first report Mr.Brown had ever been called upon to make and, in view of the conditionsreferred to above, he was left to make it almost entirely in the dark. i cannot do better than quote his own words &quot; I had to work completely in thedark. I was working completely blindfolded apart from what Mr. Ferriscould tell me&quot;. Under these circumstances it is hardly surprising to find that his report, when made, was riddled with inaccuracies. Although hewas never instructed to favour one view more than another, and I am satisfied that he did his best to make a perfectly fair and unbiased report,he started with the knowledge, which he had had for the past 15 months,that the Land Commission^ accepted policy was to equip and develop theland as one unit, and that all his superiors were extremely keen on the project.Under these circumstances it would have been expecting too much of humannature to suppose that, however unconsciously, a very junior official suchas Mr. Brown would not approach his task with at least a leaning in:favour of supporting his departments already settled policy.26. On 7tih August, 1952, Mr. Brown sent his draft report to Mr. Hole,and at the same time sent a copy to Mr. Lofthouse. The report starts by stating that Crichel Down was purchased by the Air Ministry in 1940. Infact it was compulsorily acquired in 1937, as is abundantly clear fromthe Conveyance of the Hooper area. I mention this for two reasons, firstbecause it may explain a later error as to the condition of the land when itwas taken over, and secondly because Mr. Brown stated that he reliedexclusively on the Conveyances for his information as to the circumstances in
-which the land was acquired. 1940 is in fact the date of the actualConveyances themselves.27. The report states that the whole area (with the exception of some114 acres) was at the date of purchase virgin downland in a very roughcondition, covered with much scrub and gorse, infested with rabbits and used as a sheep run. The statement that the land was covered with much scrub and.gorse and infested with rabbits was quite untrue, though such may well havebeen the position in 1940, which was 3 years after the Air Ministry took itover, A statement that as far as could foe ascertained the land had never-foeen under plough before was also incorrect in fact, though of course Mr.Brown had no means of discovering that fact. There was at least another72 acres of arable land in addition to the 114 acres mentioned in the report,and large areas were fenced, watered, and used for grazing cattle. Mr.Brown stated quite frankly that he was under the impression that the wholedown had been just an open stretch, apart from the 114 acres he mentioned.28. The report states that the Hooper area was purchased compulsorily,but that the Crichel and Strange areas were acquired voluntarily by agreement.Mr. Brown said in evidence that he came to this conclusion by looking atthe Conveyances. Having examined the Conveyances I am satisfied that it isquite reasonable and understandable that anyone, having no other source of information available, should have come to such a conclusion. TheHooper Conveyance makes it clear on the face of it that it is made in pursu-ance of a compulsory purchase, the other two Conveyances do not, and arein a form which is much more consistent with a voluntary purchase. This-mistake was particularly unfortunate as it is clearly one of great importance,as was generally admitted, and it would never have occurred if Mr. Hole&apos;sdirection to make enquiries of the Air Ministry Land Agent had been com-municated to Mr. Brown and carried out. The Report continues with a-Statement that the prices paid by the Air Ministry give an indication of thecondition of the land at the time of purchase and show that the two largerowners were not unwilling to part with it at a low price. This again isquite untrue, and the early correspondence, which was not available to Mr.Brown and could only have been discovered by an application to the AirMinistry Land Agent, makes it quite clear that in fact they strenuouslyresisted the compulsory acquisition of their land, but without avail.29. In the report, Mr. Brown states that he understands that the land commission^ policy is to equip the land as a single unit at a cost ofapproximately  20,000, and in evidence he stated that this policy had been well known to him since he joined the Land Service some 15 months previous-ously, and that he agreed with it. He also states that if Crichel Estateshould obtain possession of the Crichel Area it would almost certainly beadded to the Hardings&apos; farm, the buildings of which are inadequate for theexisting acreage. The statement that the Hardings&apos; buildings were inadequate for the existing acreage was incorrect, and in direct contradiction of the view expressed by Mr. Lofthouse in his letter of 27th May, 1952, to Mr. Hole, inwhich he stated that if the Crichel Area was added to the Hardings&apos; farm no new equipment-would be necessary and there would be a properly balancedunit between buildings and acreage. Mr. Brown was never shown a copy ofthis letter, and had never seen the Hardings&apos; buildings, and he said that hebased his statement on what he was told by Mr. Ferris. He also statesthat the Hardings already had 170 acres of rough downland which couldwell be reclaimed before they were given any more land. This figure, which mr. Brown obtained from obsolete records, was inaccurate. The total amount-of unreclaimed land on the Hardings&apos; farm at that time being about 60 acres,which they were then in the course of, or about to commence, ploughing up.
Later in the report, Mr. Brown states that the Crichel Estate are much more interested in the Crichel Area than they are in some of the land at presentin their ownership. This statement was quite unjustified, and it was common ground throughout the Inquiry that the whole of the Crichel Estate is and always has been very well farmed. He goes on to say that the opportunitypresented by these 726 acres of bare land is an unparalleled one for theerection of a modern farming unit on a scale which will be of interest andexample to the farming community for many miles around. In evidence hesaid that the Land Service were responsible for advisory work and that thiswas a very unusual opportunity to show what could be done and that hewas really enthusiastic about the idea.30. Finally in his report Mr. Brown came to the conclusion that if theCrichel Area was sold back to the Crichel Estate it would not be possible to equip the remainder of Crichel Down as a self-contained unit, and that therefore the choice lay between either selling back the whole of crichel down to the previous owners or other adjoining owners or else proceeding with the scheme to equip the whole as one self-contained unit. The evidenceclearly showed that these were in fact the only two practical alternatives, apartfrom letting the land as bare land without equipping it. He stated that he felt certain that the neighbouring farmers would be willing to buy back the land but that difficulty might well be experienced over price. Thepossibility of difficulty over price was of necessity pure guesswork on his part and was not based on any enquiry he had made or information he hadreceived. He concludes by expressing the view that, as only rough off-lyingland attached to large farms was taken and all but 15 acres of that byagreement, there was no case for a sale of the Crichel area or any other part of the land, and the best course was to go ahead with the existing scheme. After the errors in his report had all been pointed out to him,Mr. Brown stated in evidence that had the true facts been fully before himhe would still have come to the same conclusion. The point, however, isthat those who had subsequently to come to their own conclusion on his report might have come to a different conclusion if the facts had beencorrectly stated in it.31. Mr. Brown further stated that Mr. Ferris had seen his draft report and fully concurred in it. When his attention was drawn to Mr. Ferris&apos;sletter of 10th December, 1949, expressing a directly contrary view, he said he had never seen that letter, but he was quite satisfied that Mr. Ferris hadentirely revised his original opinion. It was, therefore, particularly unfortunate that Mr. Ferris declined to give any evidence at the Inquiry,although (I was informed) he had been requested to do so both by theMinistry and by Lieut.-Commander Marten and was still living and working in the neighbourhood. It would have been of great assistance to knowexactly why Mr. Ferris had completely changed his opinion as to the best method of dealing with the land, and also how he came to approve theinaccuracies in Mr. Brown&apos;s report, some at least of which ought to havebeen evident to him.32. On 10th August, 1952, Lieut.-Commander Marten wrote direct to theMinister saying that the Crichel Estate would be willing to buy the wholeof Crichel Down if this would assist in overcoming any objection to theresale of the Crichel Area alone, but it appears that the Minister was already;aware of that fact.33. On 3rd August, 1952, Mr. Watson-Jones, a farmer member of theLand Commission, inspected Crichel Down accompanied by Mr. Ferris. Hesaid in evidence that his primary object was to see whether, if the Crichel
Area was sold back to the Crichel Estate, the remaining land could be satis-f actorily equipped as a single unit. On 13th August, he made a written reportto the Land Commission in which he said that if the Crichel Area was soldit would seriously interfere with existing plans to farm Crichel Down andhe considered that it should be retained. His report goes on to say thatCrichel Estate have no farm buildings reasonably near this area. When itwas pointed out to him in cross-examination that the Hardings&apos; farm buildings are within a few hundred yards of Crichel Down he said that what he meant was that there were no farm buildings reasonably near the centre of the land. He also stated that he was convinced Mr. Ferris had abandoned the view expressed by him in his letter of 10th December, 1949.34. On 13th August, 1952, Mr. Hole sent Mr. Brown&apos;s report to the land commission with a covering letter in which he expressed his own views tothe following effect:  (a) If Crichel Down is equipped as a single unit greater production of crops and livestock is likely.(Jb) The cost of equipping will be in the order of  20,000 and he verymuch doubts if the increase in production would justify such a heavy outlay on the short term view whether it would do so onthe long term view depends on the future prosperity of agriculture.(c) If the Crichel Area was sold back the remaining land could not be equipped as a single unit.id) All the adjoining owners are competent farmers who would probablybe quite pleased to have their land back.Mr. Hole ends by saying that although the proposal to create one fully equipped farm is most attractive from many points of view the high costof doing so makes him wonder whether the project should be undertaken.35. Sir Frederick Burrows stated that this letter was never passed on tothe Ministry, though Mr. Brown&apos;s report.was.36. On 20th August, 1952, the Land Commission held a meeting at which mr. Hole&apos;s letter and Mr. Brown&apos;s report were considered, and as a resultof that meeting Mr. Smith wrote to Mr. Payne at the Ministry setting outthe Land Commission^ view to the effect that, if the Crichel Area was sold,it would not be possible to develop the remainder of the land as a selfcontained unit and therefore the only course reasonably open would be tooffer the remainder back to the previous owners. The evidence showed thatthis advice was undoubtedly sound. The letter then went on to state other factors which it was suggested the Minister might wish to have in mind.These were apparentiy taken from Mr. Brown&apos;s report and were sub-stantially incorrect in the following respects:  (a) It was stated that both the Crichel and Strange areas were acquired by agreement, although as noted above Mr. Smith (who signed theletter) must at least have known that Lieut.-Commander Martenhad specifically stated that the Crichel Area was acquired com-pulsorily. Mr. Smith unfortunately was not available to explainthis.(b) It was stated that there were still 170 acres of rough unimproveddownland on the Crichel Estate adjacent to the S.E. boundary ofthe Crichel Area.(c) It was stated that the buildings on the Hardings&apos; farm were inadequate for the existing acreage.
(d) It was stated that if the Strange Area was sold back there was nodoubt in the Land Commission^ view that it would not be fully and efficiently used, but would tend to go back to a sheep run.There appears to have been nothing on which such an opinioncould have been based, and it is contrary to the view expressedby Mr. Hole and to the accepted fact that Mr. Strange was a first class farmer.37. In the penultimate paragraph of the letter Mr. Smith says, &quot; Finally,I would say that the purchase and equipment of the Crichel property as one unit /would be a satisfactory proposition from the financial point, ofview . . .&quot;. This appears to be the personal view of Mr. Smith rather&quot;than a view taken by the Land Commission. It is somewhat strange thatMr. Smith, who apparently is not an agricultural expert but merely theSecretary to the Commission, should take upon himself to express such aview to the Ministry in face of Mr. Hole&apos;s letter which contains a gravewarning to the contrary which warning was never passed on to the Ministry.38. The Land Commission^ final advice to the Minister is &quot; that thewhole area should be retained and equipped as a unit in the interests of full and efficient production &quot;.39. It is to be noted that no mention was made in this letter of CaptainTaylor&apos;s offer to rent the land unequipped at a rent of  2,000 per annum,nor was the existence of such an offer ever brought to the notice of theMinistry.40. In September, 1952, a policy letter was drafted by Mr. Payne at theMinistry for Mr. Nugent to send to Mr. Crouch, based on the recommen-dations of the Land Commission. Mr. Nugent, however, wished to make further enquiries and the letter was not sent though the draft was later used as the basis of a subsequent letter in March, 1953, with which I deal later.At the instigation of Mr. Nugent further enquiries were made by Mr. Paynethrough the Lands Service, as a result of which Mr. Hole wrote to Mr.Payne on 14th October, stating (inter alia) that if Crichel Down was resoldto previous owners he would expect to get a total of  25,480 for the land.It would appear from the evidence that this was an over-estimate and thatthe true value of the land in its then condition was probably about  21.000.41. On 15th November, 1952, at the request of the Minister, Lord Car-rangton, Parliamentary Secretary (Lords) to the Ministry, visited crichel down for the purpose of inspecting the land and reporting direct to theMinister. Lord Cairrinigton was accompanied by Mr. Ferris but he did notvisit any of the adjoining owners or inspect any of the adjoining land. Forsome reason which I did not appreciate he seemed to think it would have(been improper for him to do so. Before going to inspect the land LordCarrington had read Mr. Brown&apos;s report and he stated that he assumed the statements of fact in it to be true for the purposes of his own report.42. On 19th November, 1952, Lord Carrington reported the result of hisinspection in writing to the Minister. In it he stated that from the agri-cultural point of view he felt convinced that Crichel Down should be equipped and farmed as a single unit. He then gave five reasons for that view, but they all appear to be based on the disadvantages of selling theCrichel Area and retaining the remainder, and none of them really touchesthe question of the advisability of selling the whole.43. On 11th December, 1952, Mr. Wilcox, an Under-Secretary at theMinistry, wrote to Mr. Hole stating that Lord Carrington had advised thatif Crichel Down was to be sold, it should be sold as one unit and not split
;up, and asking for advice as to whether if sold as one unit it would bebetter to sell the bare land or to equip it as a self-contained unit before sale.On the 16th December, Mr. Hole replied reducing his original estimate of the,value of the bare land from  25,000 to  20,000, which from the evidenceappears to have been substantially correct, and that after expending an estimated figure of  22,500 in equipping Crichel Down it might be expectedto realise about  41,000 with vacant possession or  31,000 with a sittingtenant paying a rent of 43s. 6d. per acre.44. Mr. Hole&apos;s letter was given careful consideration at the Ministry. SirReginald Franklin, Deputy Secretary to the Ministry, expressed the view thatthe interests of food production could best be served by equipping the land and selling with vacant possession by private treaty to some person selectedas a good farmer. Mr. Manktelow, the Principal Finance Officer suggestedvery naturally that from a financial point of view it would be better to sell theland in its present condition, but said that he would not press this if pro-vision of equipment before sale was considered desirable on the groundsol food production policy so long as it was sold witih vacant possession. he further stated that he would prefer a sale by auction to ensure getting thebest price and to disarm financial criticism. Mr. Nugent stated that equip-ping the land was right in the interests of production but some thoughtwould be needed to justify selling the equipped holding at a loss. The legaldepartment advised quite correctly that it would not be possible in law,on a sale of the bare land, to impose an effective obligation on the pur-chaser to equip the land or to farm it as one unit.45. ft is at this stage that the Commissioners of Crown Lands (hereinafter called &quot; Crown Lands &quot;) first come upon the scene, and it is necessary to appreciate their organisation. There are three Commissioners, namely aPermanent Commissioner and two ex-officio&apos; Commissioners. The PermanentCommissioner at all material times was Mr. Eastwood, who was firstappointed in October, 1952, having previously been an Assistant Under-Secretary of State in the Colonial Office, where he dealt with tropical agri-culture, apart from which he had no special agricultural knowledge or experience. The two ex-officio Commissioners are the Minister of Agricul-ture and the Secretary of State for Scotland for the time being. TheCommissioners never meet as a body and their business is conducted bythe Permanent Comimissioner, who refers at his discretion^ on matters of major policy to the Minister or, in the case of land in Scotland, to theSecretary of State for Scotland. Crown Lands own at the present timesome 370,000 acres of land and are under a statutory obligation to investany moneys in their hands in the purchase of land, Treasury sanctionbeing necessary to any expenditure. Their estates are managed in somecases by a local full time staff of their own, and in others by local firmsof Estate Agents employed on a part time basis for the purpose of the termsof written agreements, which vary from case to case, and who are known asCrown Receivers.46. On 8th January, 1953, Mr. Wilcox met Mr. Eastwood and they lunchedtogether at a Club of which they were both members. Crown Lands had at that time a large amount of money available for investment and Mr.Wilcox told Mr. Eastwood about Crdchel Down, suggesting that it mightbe a suitable property for Crown Lands to acquire. Mr. Wilcox made itclear that the property would have to be equipped and farmed as a singleunit, but at that stage it was not known whether the Ministry would equipit prior to the sale or whether Crown Lands would be required to undertaketo equip it themselves if they bought it.
47. Crown Lands already owned the Bryanston Estate in Dorset whichwas managed by Messrs. Sanctuary and Son, a firm of Estate Agents atBridport, as Crown Receivers under the terms of an agreement dated 6thMarch, 1951.48. On 18th January, 1953, Mr. Wilcox wrote to Mr. Eastwood sayingthat he thought the Ministry would prefer to transfer ahe land to crown lands as bare land in its present state. On 24th January, Mr. Eastwoodinspected Crichel Down accompanied by an employee of Sanctuary and Son.On 3rd February, Mr. Thomson, a partner in Sanctuary and Son, who hadmeanwhile inspected Crichel Down himself wrote a full report to Mr.Eastwood, in which he set out his own scheme for equipping the land withhis estimate of cost which amounted to  40,000 which was nearly double the Land Commission estimate. He assumes the land would be acquiredfor  15,000, making the total expenditure  55,000, which he frankly statesseems to him much too high for a farm of that kind. He states that the absolute maximum rent would be  2,100 ( 3 per acre) and that he wouldhave great difficulty in getting it, and taking a long term view he wouldprobably have to be content with a rent oif  1,400, which would give a capital value of about  30,000. He concludes by advising that Crown Landsought not to consider the purchase of the land unless it can be acquired fora good deal less than the price originally suggested, and even then crown lands should not commit themselves until they had had about two months in which to find a suitable tenant and agree with him a minimum rent. Thenext day Mr. Thomson wrote again (after consulting Mr. Middleton of the lands Service) saying that he could make economies in his estimate forequipping Criclhel Down but that Crown Lands should not consider buyingthe land unless they could get it for  15,000.49. On 16th February, 1953, a meeting took place at the Ministry between mr. Wilcox and Mr. Easuwood at which Mr. Hole, Mr. Thomson and certain other gentlemen were present. The conclusions reached were that it would cost about  32,000 to equip Crichel Down and Crown Lands could do nothing until they had ascertained what rent a tenant would be preparedto pay. It was agreed that if, as a result of a meeting the next day betweenthe Minister and Sir Frederick Burrows, the Minister was prepared toauthorise a sale, Mr. Thomson would then be authorised to start localinquiries as to the rent obtainable and if these were satisfactory Mr. Thomson,Mr. Hole and the District Valuer should meet on the site and endeavourto agree a price for the sale of Crichel Down as bare land.50. It is to be noted that on-one at this meeting, except Mr. Hole, was aware that a number of applications had been received by the Lands service for tenancies of Crichel Down, and that the applicants had been told thattheir applications would be considered and that in due course it was proposed to advertise the tenancy for public tender. Mr. Hole nevermentioned this at the meeting.51. After the meeting Mr. Thomson told Mr. Eastwood that he had apossible tenant in mind, namely Mr. Tozer. Mr. Thomson did not know that Mr. Tozer had already made several applications to the Lands service for a tenancy of Crichel Down and had him in mind solely because he had applied for the tenancy of a farm on the Bryanston Estate in January, 1951,which had already been let and was no longer available. Mr. Thomson&apos;sonly personal knowledge of Mr. Tozer was that he had met him in the spring of 1948 when Mr. Thomson was negotiating the purchase of an estateon which Mr. Tozer was a tenant of one of the farms. Mr. Thomson said he had spent a lot of time going over Mr. Tozer&apos;s farm and formed the
opinion that he was a very good farmer. Mr. Thomson&apos;s partner knewsomething of the Tozer family, however, as the firm of Sanctuary and Son(in which Mr. Thomson was not then a pafltner) had acted as advisoryagents to the Pitt-Rivers Estate from 1925 to 1935, and the Tozer familywere at that time tenant farmers on that estate.52. On 17th February, 1953, Sir Frederick Burrows saw the Minister whoinformed him of the proposal to sell Crichel Down unequipped to crown lands. Sir Frederick agreed to the proposal but asked that a firm decision might be made within two months, since if the land was not to be soldthe Land Commission would have to proceed with equipping it as speedilyas possible so that it could be let at Michaelmas. Sir Frederick stressed that the Land Commission were most anxious to avoid having to continueto farm Criohel Down themselves after Michaelmas. Neither the Ministernor Sir Frederick were aware of the existing applications for tenancies.Mr. Wilcox duly informed Mr. Easitwood of the two months&apos; time limit.53. On 19th February, 1953, Mr. Eastwood telephoned Mr. Thomsonauthorising him to start looking for a suitable tenant but giving him clearinstructions that no definite arrangements were to be made until the whole scheme had been referred to Mr. Eastwood and approved&apos; by him.Mr. Thomson at once telephoned Mr. Tozer and asked him if he would be interested in the tenancy. Mr. Tozer was interested, and Mr. Thomson went to see him on 22nd February. At that meeting Mr. Thomson explained hisideas for equipping the farm, and asked Mr. Tozer if he would be willingto take a tenancy of it when it was equipped at a rent of  3 per acre. Mr.Tozer said he wanted to discuss it with his father and brother and would letMr. Thomson know later. On 27th February^ Mr. Tozer wrote toMr. Thomson saying that he would very much like to go forward with the proposition.54. On 2nd March, 1953, Mr. Nugent wrote to Mr. Crouch explaining theposition. The letter was drafted by Mr. Wilcox from the draft prepared byMr. Payne in September, 1952, which has been previously mentioned. Theletter states that the buildings on Hardings&apos; farm would not be adequate ifthe Crichel Area was added to the farm, and that there were still some 170acres of rough land on the farm which could well be reclaimed. In facteven the 60 acres, which were rough land in September, had by then beenploughed up. These inaccuracies not unnaturally annoyed Lieut. CommanderMarten when the letter was sent to him by Mr. Crouoh. especially as noenquiries had ever been made of the Hardings or the Crichel Estate withregard to these matters.55. On 11th March, 1953, Mr. Middleton, who had succeeded Mr.Lofthouse in December, 1952, as Land Service Officer for Somerset andDorset discovered for the first time the file containing the previous applica-tions for tenancies and thereupon wrote to Mr. Hole pointing out that ifCrown Lands should finally decide to purchase Cnichel Down the existingapplicants for tenancies might feel that the Ministry had broken faith withthem and asking whether Crown Lands shouki be told of the position and sent a list of applicants.56. Mr. Hole replied that the situation was awkward since it was not known whether Crown Lands would definitely buy the property or not andall that Mr. Middleton could do would be to send the list of applicants toMr. Thomson and ask him if he would consider any of them. This Mr,Middleton did on the 19th March, stating that in most cases applicants hadbeen promised that they would have an opportunity to tender and that letting
would be by public tender. He further suggested in his letter that Mr.Thomson should give this some thought before making definite arrangements with Mr. Tozer.57. Mr. Thomson replied the next day saying he would pass the letter onto Crown Lands and adding that if the sale went through there was no. doubtthat Mr. Tozer would get the farm, but asking Mr. Middleton to treat this as confidential until matters were finally settled.58. Mr. Thomson admitted in evidence that at the time of writing this letter he had already made up his mind that, if Crown Lands purchasedCrichel Down, Mr. Tozer and no-one else was going to get the tenancy. Hewas unable to give any satisfactory explanation of why he asked Mr.Middleton to treat this as confidential.59. On the same day Sanctuary &amp; Son (i.e. Mr. Thomson) wrote to crown lands enclosing Mr. Middleton&apos;s letter but not a copy of Mr. Thomson&apos;reply. In this letter they stated that it was rather late in the day for theinformation to be given to them as they had already spent a great deal oftime with Mr. Tozer, and in view of the rent of  3 per acre which he was prepared to pay they very much hoped the sale would go through. In fact,all that had been done with Mr. Tozer was to visit some five or six farmsin the vicinity for the purpose of seeing what sort of equipment would benecessary.60. On 23rd March, Mr. Eastwood replied and I quote verbatim from this-extraordinary letter:  &quot; I quite appreciate that you have gone too far with Tozer to make iteasy to give the land to anybody else and I am not suggesting that weshould, in fact, do so. But I think it would be well that you should ask Middleton to send you particulars of all those who have applied forthe land and exactly what promises have been made to them. You maythen be able to judge whether any of them are likely to have been serious competitors and we can. then decide, in conjunction with theMinistry of Agriculture, what if anything we need to do, at least to appear to implement the promises made to them. Meanwhile I do notthink you need hold up your discussions with Tozer or recommendations to us on this account.&quot;Mr. Eastwood admitted that he had not made any inquiry and did not know at all how far Mr. Thomson had gone with Mr. Tozer when he wrotethis letter. Mr. Eastwood sent a copy of this letter and the correspondenceleading up to it to Mr. Wilcox.61. On 25th March, Mr. Wilcox replied and1 again I quote verbatim from&quot;his letter:  &quot; It is of course a pity that Middleton did not let Thomson have earlierinformation about the promises given to various farmers on behalf of theA.L.C. that they would be given an opportunity for tendering if it werebeing let by the Agricultural Land Commission.Clearly if you buy a property then you are in no way bound by thesepromises, and I appreciate it may be too late for Thomson to go backon anything he may have arranged provisionally with Tozer but I amvery glad that you asked Thomson, to get hold of the list of names fromMiddleton so that we can consider whether there is anything that couldbe done with a view at any rate to appear to be implementing any pastpromises. I imagine that you and Thomson for your part will be anxious to avoid doing anything that may leave a bad taste in the
mouths of any of the disappointed applicants, which might, e.g., prejudiceyour chance of getting them as tenants for other of your properties on your Bryanston Estate at some future date.&quot;At the time Mr. Wilcox wrote this letter his immediate superior at theMinistry, Sir Reginald Franklin, was away on urgent work connected with thefloods in East Anglia, and Mr. Wilcox took upon himself to write this very important letter without consulting any higher authority. Mr. Nugent told me in evidence that if he had seen it he would not have allowed it tobe sent.62. Mr. Eastwood not unnaturally took the statement &quot; Clearly if youbuy a property then you are in no way bound by these promises &quot; as beingexpress authority from the Ministry to go ahead and disregard the previousapplicants.63. In fairness to Mr. Wilcox I should say that I am not entirely satisfiedthat he realised at the time of writing the letter the full significance of these words, though he readily admitted in evidence that they bore that implications-tion and that such a decision ought clearly to have been referred to higher authority. (He also admitted that the idea of doing something to appearto be implementing promises which there was no intention to implement was so improper that it ought never to have been considered for a moment.64. It may be that this was more a case of failing to give proper con-sideration to what he was writing, than of any deliberate intention to devisesome scheme to mislead the other applicants. It is to be noted that the relevant passage in the letter is quoted almost verbatim from Mr. Eastwood&apos;sletter to Mr. Thomson. I found Mr. Wilcox a very nervous witness andnot very clear in his explanations, but I am satisfied that he was doing his best to be frank and to tell the truth.65. In fact the applicants were never informed of the true position, but nothing was ever done by the Ministry to mislead them.66. On 26th March, 1953, Mr. Thomson replied to Mr. Eastwood sayingthat, in view of the distance he had gone with Mr. Tozer and because of hissuitability, he did not think anyone else should be allowed to think thatthey had any chance of renting Crichel Down, and suggesting that a tactfulletter be written to the various applicants turning down then offers. this advice unfortunately was not followed, and the strange thing is that afterexpressing this perfectly correct view Messrs. Sanctuary &amp; Son received on18th May 1953 a new application for a tenancy of Crichel Down from aMr. Longman, which was forwarded to them by Mr. Middleton with a request that they would give him a proper reply, and on the next day Sanctuary&amp; Son wrote to Mr. Longman stating that if Criohel Down was acquired by Crown Lands his application would be considered with the others whichhad already been received. Mr. Thomson admitted in evidence that theyhad no intention of considering Mr. Longman&apos;s application or any of theother applications if Crown Lands acquired Crichel Down, as both he andMr. Eastwood had already made up their minds that Mr. Tozer was tohave the tenancy. He was quite unable to give any explanation as towhy such a letter was written to Mr. Longman, and merely said that itwas the usual common-form letter to write, an explanation which I couldnot accept. Mr. Thomson&apos;s evidence generally and his attitude in the witnessbox was unsatisfactory. He was obviously a man accustomed to havinghis own way and strongly resented anyone questioning anything that he had done or querying any decision that he had come to or advice that he had given.
67. On 1st April, 1953, Messrs. Sanctuary &amp; Son wrote a long letter to crown Lands giving a revised detailed estimate of the cost of equippingCrichel Down, amounting to a total expenditure of  34,632. This estimateincluded the following item &quot;Fees and expenses. Minimum... 2,160&quot;.Mr. Thomson explained that this represented Messrs. Sanctuary &amp; Son&apos;sscale fees as Architects and Surveyors in respect of the planning and super-vision of the work, calculated at 6 per cent, on the cost. He said the word&quot; minimum &quot; was inserted because 6 per cent, is the minimum scale feeallowed under the R.I.B.A. Scale of Professional Charges. A print of theR.I.B.A. Scale was put in evidence, and shows that 6 per cent, is the fixedfee for an architect employed on new work if the contract or order exceeds 4,000. Mr. Thomson then said the word &quot; minimum &quot; was used because he might have charged separately for each item, and on individual itemsunder  4,000 the fee could be scaled up to a maximum of 10 per cent, for small items, and &quot; minimum &quot; meant he was not going to charge in thisway. It is to be noted that the R.I.B.A. Scale expressly provides that thecharge may be reduced to 5 per cent, in the case of extensive works of a simple character which involve repetition of units. It is also to be notedthat 6 per cent, on the total expenditure (excluding of course the fee itself)amounted to  1,950 and that  150 was estimated travelling expenses. It is atleast very doubtful whether Sanctuary &amp; Son would be entitled to chargetravelling expenses in addition to the R.I.B.A. Scale fee. The items onwhich the fee was charged included inter alia the following:   Two Dutch Barns   ..................      2,000ElectricityRoads ...FencingGates   ...Water SupplyTotal6003,1501,5003001,811 9,361Mr. Thomson admitted that an architect would not normally be employed-or entitled to charge a fee in respect of any of the above items.68. Under Messrs. Sanctuary &amp; Son&apos;s contract with Crown Lands their remuneration is fixed at 10 per cent, on all moneys received by them onaccount of rents and such fees as may be mutually agreed upon for any work carried out by them and not covered by their commission. TheTreasury had agreed that Messrs. Sanctuary &amp; Son should receive theR.I.B.A. Scale fee for any new buildings or improvement work they under-took on behalf of Crown Lands.69. Mr. Eastwood stated that he had tacitly accepted and would have authorised payment of the estimated fee of  2,160 on the assumptionthat it was the correct minimum R.I.Q3.A. Scale fee. In fairness to Mr.Thomson it must be clearly stated that the figure of  2,160 was only anestimate, and it may well be that when the the claim for fees was finallyiput forward it would have been correctly calculated.70. Meanwhile on the 27ith March, 1953, Lieut--Commander Marten had had an interview with Mr. Nugent at the Ministry. Mr. Nugent said thatthe most important part of that meeting was that Lieut-Commander Marten:made an entirely new proposal that he should himself be allowed to become
the tenant of the whole of Crichel Down and farm it from his existing hold-ing as one of his own farms. He explained exactly how this could be done with little or no new permanent equipment, and Mr. Nugent promised him that the proposal would be carefully considered. Mr. Nugent said that hewas quite unaware at the time of this interview that Crown Lands were con-tending that they were already committed to Mr. Tozer and would not beprepared to consider any other tenant. As this fact was of course well knownto Mr. Wilcox it is strange that Mr. Nugent was not apprised of it before he saw Lieut.-Commander Marten, but it is quite clear that he was not; andMr. Wilcox could not explain why not. Mr. Nugent subsequently saw theMinister about Lieut.-Commander Marten&apos;s new offer and then learnt of theposition with regard to Crown Lands. On 16th April, he wrote to Mr.Crouch saying that the sale to Crown Lands was the right course and that itwas too late to go back on it now. He did not, however, explain that crown lands had already decided on a tenant.71. On 21st April, Lieut-Commander Marten wrote to the Minister directsaying that he felt the Minister could not have had a fair presentation of thefacts. As a result, on 5th May, 1953, the Minister had a private meeting withcertain Members of Parliament at which Mr. Crouch was present. The posi-tion was fully explained to them by the Minister as appears from Mr.Crouch&apos;s letter to&apos; the Minister of 5th May, 1953, but the Minister regarded the meeting as confidential and no evidence was given as to what tookplace at it.72. On 24th April, 1953, a meeting took place on Crichel Down betweenthe District Valuer, Mr. Hole, and Mr. Thomson, at which a price of  15,000for the bare land subject to an obligation to equip it as a self contained unitwas agreed and approved by the District Valuer. It was clear from theevidence that this was a fair price if the land was burdened with the obligationto equip it, though if it had been sold free from such obligation it wouldhave been worth probably about  21,000.73. On 25th April, Sanctuary &amp; Son reported the result to&apos; Crown Landsstrongly recommending the purchase of the land at the agreed price of. 15,000, and saying that if offered back to the original owners it would fetchabout  21,000 adding &quot; Please do not let the Ministry know this &quot;. Since touse Mr. Eastwoods own words &quot; The money will only be transferred fromone public or quasi-public pocket to another&quot; it is a little difficult to seewhy Sanctuary &amp; Son were so anxious that the full facts should not be disclosed to the Ministry. In point of fact however, the Ministry mustalready have been well aware that they could get a substantially higher pricethan  15,000 by selling back to the original owners.74. On 14th May, 1953, Lieut-Commander Marten wrote to Crown Landssaying that he would like to buy Crichel Down if an opportunity occurredand if Crown Lands decided not to buy themselves he would be gratefulif they would let him know so that he could again approach the Ministry.This letter was never answered.7.5. On the same day Mr. Eastwood wrote to Mr. Wood at the Treasuryasking for Treasury approval to the purchase of Crichel Down by crown lands at the price of  15,000 and to the expenditure of up to  34,000 inequipping it. The draft of this letter had previously been approved by Mr.Wilcox on behalf of the Ministry. In this letter he stated that a suitabletenant had been found prepared to pay  2,100 p.a. rent and that on that basis the return would be about 3^ per cent. He pointed out that the return waslow but Crown Lands would be doing a service to the Ministry and wouldrgain a lot of very interesting experience.   (The underlining is mine.)
76. To this Mr. (Wood replied that he felt some doubt about the proposal and asked whether it was intended to put the farm up for auction whenavailable for letting in order to test the market. Finally he stated that asthe property was near the Bryanston Estate he would approve the transaction.To this Mr. Eastwood replied that he was not going to put the farm up forauction as Crown Lands had already decided on a tenant. He went on tosay that the tenant was selected after a good deal of enquiry by their LocalAgent and that he was satisfied that the rent of  3 per acre was a very good one for the land, which was not worth much more than 7s. 6d. beforethe war.77. Mr. Eastwood admitted that he made no enquiry of Mr. Thomsonbefore writing this letter as to what enquiries he had made before selectingMr. Tozer as a tenant. In fact Mr. Thomson had made none. He neverat any time considered the possibility of any other tenant, and the onlyenquiries he had ever made about Mr. Tozer were in 1948. Mr. Eastwoodalso admitted that he made no enquiries as to the value of the land beforethe war and thought that he had got the figure of 7s. 6d. per acre fromsomething Sir Reginald Franklin had said about the value of that typeof land generally.78. It is regrettable that a responsible official in the position of a Trustee, as mr. Eastwood undoubtedly was, should have answered questions relatingto authority for the expenditure of Trust moneys in this light-hearted manner.In point of fact, however, no harm can have been done since the evidenceclearly showed that Mr. Tozer was a first class farmer, and the rent of  3 per acre was a very good one. It also appeared that the estimated rentalvalue of the land pre-war at 7s. 6d. per acre, though low was not altogetherunreasonable.79. The question now arose as to the basis on which Mr. Tozer was totake over and in particular whether he was to be entitled to any claim fordilapidations in respect of overcropping and foul land. The Land Ccan-mission contended that no claim for dilapidations should be allowed. Forsome reason, which Mr. Thomson was unable to explain satisfactorily,Sanctuary and Son took up the cudgels on behalf of Mr. Tozer and insisted that he should be allowed a claim for dilapidations on the ordinary basis as between an incoming and outgoing tenant. In point of fact this was nota transaction between incoming and outgoing tenants at all, but a simpleisale by an owner-occupier of the freehold (i.e. the Ministry occupying andfarming through their agents the Land Commission) to a new owner (crown lands) who was subsequently going to let on an entirely new tenancy to anew tenant (Mr. Tozer).80. I am satisfied, after hearing expert evidence on the subject, that no claim for dilapidations should have been allowed.  That Sanctuary and Sonwere fully aware of this position is clear from their letter to Crown Landsdated 8th June, 1953, in which they say dilapidations form part of the land-lords&apos; counterclaim against the tenants&apos; title to be paid for unexhausted valuesetc. and there is no legal right to such a counterclaim against a vendorany more than there is a legal right for a vendor to claim Tenant Rightunless specifically provided for by the Contract of Sale.   They go on tosay that therefore Crown Lands should obtain an undertaking from theMinistry that they will pay compensation.  In these circumstances the land commission obtained the advice of an independent expert, Mr. Ingram,a partner in Messrs. Senior and Godwin, Estate Agents and Surveyors, ofSturminster Newton, who was well acquainted with Crichel Down.   Mr.Ingram strongly recommended that other than a valuation of hay, straw,
fixtures and the like, there should be no valuation of any kind (i.e. neitherTenant Right nor dilapidations). This he states is the usual position betweenvendor and purchaser and he could see no reason why the Land commission should allow any sums for dilapidations on the one hand or claim forunexhausted manurial values on the other. He ends by saying &quot; unless there is some specific undertaking to the contrary I recommend this shouldbe striotly followed &quot;. Following this the Ministry wrote to Crown Landson 15th July, 1953, in the terms of Mr. Ingram&apos;s advice.81. Again Mr. Thomson took up the cudgels on the part of Mr. Tozer.On 27th July, he wrote to Crown Lands recommending that they should press for a full scale valuation. On the same day he sent a copy of thisreport to Mr. Tozer with a covering letter in which he says &quot; I am afraidthe Land Commission are in a fairly strong position and will refuse toagree to our suggestions&quot;. Finally, however, under pressure from crown lands, supported by a letter from the Ministry dated 19th August, 1953,signed J. S. Hill and stated to have been written at the request of Mr. Garside,a Principal in the Lands Division of the Ministry, the Land Commissiongave way, and a full valuation was taken on the basis of incoming and out-going tenants. When the Land Commission were themselves proposing toput the tenancy up for public tender their form of tender expressly excludedany right to dilapidations.82. The result of this valuation was that the amount of dilapidationsexceeded the value of the tenant right by  1,624. This sum was paid bythe Ministry, or the Land Commission as their agents to Crown Lands, whopassed it on to Mr. Tozer. It is difficult to find any excuse for theadaption of this unusual procedure which resulted in putting this large sumof public money into Mr. Tozer&apos;s pooket. Mr. Thomson attempted tojustify it by saying that it was a term of Mr. Tozer&apos;s tenancy agreement thatMr. Tozer should be entitied to claim dilapidations and that this was thecommon form agreement adopted by Crown Lands. He admitted, however,that it was only common form in the case of incoming and outgoing tenants and that Mr. Tozer&apos;s agreement, being for a very unusual type of newtenancy, was being specially negotiated and had not been signed or evenfinally settled at that time. The provision in the agreement with regard todilapidations was not agreed until after the Land Commission had agreedto pay dilapidations, and the final settling of the form of Mr. Tozer&apos;s agree-ment and the signing of it were expressly held up until the consent of theLand Commission had been obtained.83. Mr. Thomson then attempted to justify this procedure by saying thatif the Land Commission had not paid for dilapidations, Crown Lands wouldhave had to. pay Mr. Tozer for them. In face of the correspondence andin the light of the expert evidence I cannot accept this contention, and Iwas not satisfied that Mr. Thomson was being itruthful about it. Mr.Thomson then said that if Mr. Tozer had not been paid for dilapidationsCrown Lands would have had to accept a lower rent than  3 per acre.In face of itihe evidence and considering the fact that nothing whatever hadbeen said about dilapidations when die amount of the rent was agreed,and ihhat the question never arose Until several months later, I cannot accept this contention either. In the Land Commission^ letter of 25th June, 1953,to Mr. Ingram Mr. Brown says &quot; Obviously from Mr. Thomston&apos;s lettershe anticipates making as good a bargain for Mr. Tozer as possible &quot;. I finditihat statement was fully justified.84. On 6th July, 1953, Lieut-Comimander Marten wrote again to crown lands pointing out that he had had no reply to his previous letter and
saying that he was keeping farm cottages free for farm workers in casehe should have the opportunity to buy or farm Crichel Down, and thereforewished to be informed of its disposal so that he might plan accordingly.On 9th July, Crown Lands replied that completion of the purchase was taking longer than expected but there was no reason ito suppose it wouldnot go through, and it was unlikely that the iland would become availablefor resale. To this Lieut.-Commander Marten replied that he had ear-marked four cottages in Long Crichel to house farm workers and was prepared to rent the land with no additional equipment whatever. he asked that his proposition for farming the land should be considered byCrown Lands.85. On 23rd July, 1953, Sanctuary &amp; Son wrote to Crown Lands stating&quot; Both the Commissioners and Mr. Tozer are irretrievably committed to thepresent proposal &quot;. This was not strictly true, but it would undoubtedly have been difficult for Crown Lands to back out at that stage. On 24th July,Mr. Nugenfs Private Secretary wrote to Mr. Crouch saying &quot; It is true thatthe Crown Lands Commissioners are proposing to let Crichel Down to Mr.Tozer, though the negotiations have not yet been completed &quot;. This accur-ately stated the true position. On 27th July, Mr. Eastwood wrote to Lieut.-Commander Marten saying there was no chance of Crown Lands being able to resell the land to him ; but entirely ignoring his offer to rent it.86. On 29th July, Mr. Nugenfs Private Secretary wrote to Crown Landsasking them to set out the justification for their present policy with par-ticular reference to Crichel Down. On 31st July, Crown Lands replied at length. The letter correctly sets out the sequence of events up to thattime, and it is important to note that when dealing with the question ofthe original applications it said &quot;Mr. Wilcox was informed of the positionand he confirmed that the Ministry did not regard us as in any way bound by the promises made by your Land Service people or by the agricultural land Commission &quot;. This in my opinion was a fair interpretation to put upon the passage in Mr. Wilcox&apos;s letter of 25th March, 1953, to which Ihave already referred.87. On 3rd August, Lieut.-Commander Marten wrote to Mr. Eastwoodsaying that it had come as a considerable shook to him to learn that crichel down had been sold to Crown Lands on terms that they were to equipit as a single unit and that they were already committed to a tenant sothat there would be no opportunity to tender for it. He also asked if hecould be told the name of the tenant. It appears that this letter, togetherwith previous correspondence with Lieut-Commander Marten, was thensent to Mr. Thomson for advice and on 13th August, 1953, he wrote to crown Lands on the subject. His letter opens with the statement &quot; Fromthe correspondence alone I should say that Commander Marten was thelast person we should want as a tenant&quot;. The letter went on to say that everything possible would be done by Lieut.-Commander Marten to embarrassing-rass both Crown Lands and Mr. Tozer and the intention to obtain per-mission to use the Crichel Estate water toad better be labandomed as Ihedoubted if any approach for permission would be favourably considered.In fact as I have already stated an agreement with the Crichel Estate forthe supply of water had been signed in June 1951. I did not have a chance to ask Mr. Thomson about this, but I assume either he must have beenunaware of that fact or else for some reason Crown Lands were not goingIto obtain the benefit of this agreement. Further on in the letter Mr.Thomson writes &quot; You certainly could not have Coimmander Marten (i.e.as a tenant) after the way he has behaved &quot;. Up to that time Mr. Thomson
had never met Lieut-Commander Marten. When asked on what he basedthese statements he replied that they were based on What he had read in thePress and seen in the correspondence. Nothing at all about Crichel Downor about Lieut-Coimimander Marten in relation thereto had up to that timeappeared in the Press. When this was pointed out to Mr. Thomson hesaid he must have based his statements solely on the correspondence. when asked to point out anything in any letter or other document that he had&apos;seen which induced him to make these statements he was unable to doso. I gave him until the next day to see if he could find anything to justifyhis statements about Lieut.-Commander Marten in this letter. Next day he referred me to a minute made by Mr. Eastwood in which Mr. Eastwoodrecorded that Lieut.-Commander Marten &quot;was talking of pressing for apublic inquiry &quot;, and said that his statements were based solely on that. Mr.Thomson then said that he thought now that his language had been&apos;intem-perate, and made a very proper apology to Lieut.-Commander Marten.88. On 20th August, 1953, Mr. Wilcox wrote to Mr. Eastwood regarding a proposed meeting on 4th September, with Mr. Nugent, at which Lieut.-Commander Marten and Mr. Eastwood were to be present. In that letterMr. Wilcox writes &quot; Commander Marten- it is thought will continue tomake himself as much a nuisance as he can both to you and to us so long&apos;as he thinks there is any chance of getting either of us to change our minds &quot;. When asked in what way Lieut.-Commander Marten was &quot; makinga nuisance of himself&quot; Mr. Wilcox said by his repeated requests to beallowed to buy or rent Crichel Down. He went on to say that Mr. Eastwoodwas afraid that Lieut.-Oommander Marten might by local agitation upset the arrangements with Mr. Tozer and that he was anxious to help Mr.Eastwood.89. In his reply to this letter Mr. Eastwood added a postscript as follows,&quot; Giffard, Chairman of the A.E.C., is a tenant of ours at Bryanston and agood chap. I am sure we can settle him &quot;. . The significance was that-objections had been taken to the letting of Crichel Down to Mr. Tozeron the grounds that Mr. Tozer already had a farm and the Tozer familywere already farming a great deal of land in the County, and Mr. Giffardas Chairman of the Agricultural Committee would almost certainly be con-suited about this. Mr. Eastwood stated in evidence that he had never tried tosettle Mr. Giffard as there had been no occasion to do so. When it was put to him that Mr. Giffard had expressed certain views on the matter he did not answer.90. On 4th September, 1953, Lieut.-Commander Marten, Mr. Eastwood,Mr. Wilcox and others attended a meeting with Mr. Nugent at the Ministry.At this meeting Lieut.-Commander Marten urged that Crown Lands should withdraw from their negotiations with Mr. Tozer and proceed to advertisethe tenancy for public tender. Mr. Eastwood stated quite correctly that although Crown Lands had not entered into any legally binding agreementwith Mr. Tozer they nevertheless felt morally bound to him. I am satisfiedthat by that time Crown Land were under a strong moral obligation toMr. Tozer since he was expecting to take over the tenancy of the bareland at Michaelmas at a reduced rent pending the erection of buildings andequipment. Mr. Eastwood agreed under pressure to see whether in thelight of local feeling Mr. Tozer would be willing to withdraw from the tenancy offered to him, but made it clear that Crown Lands could not themselves withdraw. Mr. Eastwood made it clear to the Ministry that if mr. Tozer did withdraw, Crown Lands would not go on with the purchase.This struck me as a somewhat strange attitude for Mr. Eastwood to adopt
and he was quite unable to give any satisfactory explanation of it. Mr.Eastwood subsequently saw Mr. Tozer and gave him an opportunity towithdraw, but Mr. Tozer did not wish to avail himself of it.91. On 8th September, 1953, Mr. Wilcox wrote to Mr. Hole reporting theresult of the meeting and at the end of his letter he asks if Mr. Hole canthrow any light on the circumstances in which Lieut. Commander Martenwas able to get a licence for building farm cottages in 1950, apparentlyrather &quot; on spec&quot; with the idea of enabling him to farm Crichel Downlater on. In fact Lieut. Commander Marten had never done anything ofthe sort, and Mr. Wilcox was unable to explain where he got the idea from.He admitted that it was no concern of the Ministry how Lieut. CommanderMarten had got a licence in 1950, and when I pressed him as to why he made this enquiry he answered that he did so simply out of idle curiosity.That answer I cannot accept.   It is quite clear that he did so in an attemptto find something that he could bring up to the detriment of Lieut.Commander Marten.92. Mr. Hole not unnaturally took this letter to mean that Lieut. Com-mander Marten had said he built the cottages for the express purpose of farming Crichel Down and had got a licence on that basis and was usingthis in support of his argument that he should be granted a tenancy. Thiswas of course quite incorrect. Full enquiries were made by the LandsService into the circumstances under which Lieut. Commander Martenobtained a licence for the erection of the cottages. Everything was foundto be perfectly in order and at no stage was there any indication whateverthat the cottages were to be used for the future farming of any part ofCrichel Down. In his report on the matter Mr. Middleton concludes by saying &quot; I cannot understand Commander Marten&apos;s alleged remarks and canonly infer that the mention of the cottages was rather a &apos; swift&apos; one.&quot; Itis clear that Lieut. Commander Marten had never made any statement tothe effect that the cottages were built for the purpose of farming any partof Crichel Down, and that Mr. Wilcox&apos;s inquiry into the matter was whollyunjustified and created an entirely false impression in the Lands Servicehighly detrimental to Lieut. Commander Marten.93. On 11th September, 1953, a tenancy agreement with Mr. Tozer was signed under which he became a yearly tenant of Crichel Down as from.29th September, 1953, at a rent of  1,000 for the first year plus an additional 20 for sporting rights, and  2,100 per annum thereafter plus  50 for sportingrights, there being a provision for reduction of rent if the land was not fully equipped by 29th September 1954.94. On 20th September, 1953, Mr. Trumper, Liaison Officer to the Ministerat Exeter, wrote a letter to the Ministry commencing &quot; Herewith a longtale of woe from one Commander Marten &quot; and going on to say that it seemed trouble was going to be stirred up. In this letter Mr. Trumper statesthat the Agricultural Committee had always taken the view that the landowners concerned had neither the will nor the ability to farm the land andthat they held this view strongly. Mr. Trumper did NOT give evidence,and it was impossible to ascertain whence he had obtained this wholly^erroneous information. The one thing on which every witness at the inquiry was fully agreed was that the land owners concerned were all first class farmers and that if they had obtained their land back they would.have farmed it well.95. An argument then ensued between Crown Lands and the Lands Service;as to who was to write to the original applicants to explain the position.
In fact no one ever did write to them, and by this time owing to publicity in the Press there was no particular necessity to do so.96. On 28th September, 1953, a Petition signed by a large number of farmers and landowners farming between them some 167,000 acres in thedistrict was sent by Lieut. Commander Marten to the Minister asking fora Public Inquiry.97. On 9th October, the Minister personally replied at length to Lieut.Commander Marten. The letter was drafted for the Minister by SirReginald Franklin and was very unfortunately worded. On its naturalconstruction the letter gave the impression that the Minister still thought that part of Crichel Down had been acquired voluntarily by agreement. SirReginald explained that he only meant that apart from the Hooper area theactual price had been arrived at by agreement, and whilst it is just possibleto put such a construction on the letter, it is not what anyone reading it without any oral explanation would ever have understood it to mean. it also repeated the error in Mr. Brown&apos;s report that at the date of acquisitionthe land was for the most part rough sheep run, infested by rabbits andcovered with scrub and gorse. These unfortunate mistakes were notcalculated to allay Lieut. Commander Marten&apos;s fears that the Minister him-self had never really been told the true facts.98. Lieut. Commander Marten replied at length to this letter on10th October, 1953, saying in substance that whilst entirely satisfied that theMinister had acted in all sincerity on the advice he had received and thefacts placed before him, he (Lieut. Commander Marten) was firmly convincedthat the Minister had been wilfully ill-advised and had never been told the true facts.99. After further correspondence the Minister saw Lieut. CommanderMarten on 22nd October, 1953, and as a result of that interview decided to direct that a Public Inquiry be held.100. On 23rd October, 1953, Mr. Wilicox wrote to the Agricultural Com-mittee referring to Mr. Brown&apos;s report of August 1952, in which it was statedthat the Crichel Area and Strange Area were acquired voluntarily by agree-ment and saying that they were now told by the Air Ministry that a notice to treat was served in respect of both these areas and that it was only the price that was fixed by negotiation. He goes on to say that the statement inBrown&apos;s report was passed on to the Minister, and asks if the agricultural committee can throw any light on how Brown came to make this mistake.From this letter it looks very much as though the Ministry never reallyappreciated that the Crichel Area and the Strange Area had been com-pulsorily acquired until Lieut. Commander Marten&apos;s visit to the ministry on 22nd October, though why this should be so in view of Lieut.Commander Marten&apos;s previous statements I cannot think.101. By an Order of the Minister dated 10th November, 1953, crichel down was formally withdrawn from the control of the Land Commission asfrom 29th September, 1953.102. All the professional estate agents who gave evidence, including mr.. Ingram and Mr. Thomson himself, agreed that the proposal to equipCrichel Down as a self-contained unit was so unattractive financially thatthey would never have recommended it to a private client; but there wasa marked divergence of opinion as to whether it would or would not resultin increased production.
103. After hearing and considering the evidence given at the Inquiry and taking into consideration the demeanour of the witnesses when giving their evidence and the weight that ought to be attached thereto, and afterre-reading all the material correspondence and other documents I have cometo the following:2. conclusions. The decision of the Land Commission in August 1950 to equip and letCrichel Down as a single self-contained unit was. from a purely financialpoint of view, unsound. There was a sharp divergence of expert opinion asto whether or not this method of dealing with the land would result in increased production, but there were undoubtedly ample grounds for coming to the conclusion that it would do so. Whether the advantages of increased production were such as to outweigh the financial disadvantages is a ques-tion of Government policy outside the scope of my inquiry.2. Captain Taylor&apos;s offer in May, 1952, to pay a rent of  2,000 per annum for the bare land unequipped brought into striking relief the financial dis-.advantages of the proposal to spend some  20,000 of public money inequipping the land, and the question of whether the desirability of increased production was nevertheless sufficient to justify this expenditure should havebeen carefully reconsidered as a policy question at the highest level. CaptainTaylor&apos;s offer was shelved by the Land Commission and no reconsiderationat all was given to the original decision. It was clear that by this time boththe Lands Service and the Land Commission had become so infatuated withthe idea of creating a new model farm that they were determined not to-abandon the scheme for financial reasons.3. Lieut. Commander Marten&apos;s offer to purchase the Crichel Area in May,1952, was never considered by the Land Commission as they had no powerto sell, and was never passed on to the Ministry because the Land commission at that time were under the erroneous impression that the Minister had no power to sell the land or that at any rate it was a fixed Government policy:not to sell any land.4. When the Land Commission were required by the Ministry in July,1952, to submit a report as to the desirability of selling the Crichel Areaback to the Crichel Estate, the Lands Service, whom they asked to supply the necessary report, failed to take the necessary steps to ensure that an accurate and objective report was supplied. Mr. Brown was too junior andinexperienced to have been entrusted with such an important task. He was never supplied with the full correspondence and documents relating to tnematters on which he had to report and the ridiculous and wholly unnecessaryrestrictions placed upon him made it impossible for him accurately toascertain the necessary facts. Furthermore, so junior an official could not fail to be influenced by the decisions which had already been made and itwould have been far more satisfactory if an independent expert who waswell acquainted with the district had been employed. As a result Mr. Brown&apos;sreport was inaccurate in the respects stated above under the FactualNarrative and was not only of little value, but definitely misleading, for thepurpose for which it was required. Under the circumstances, however, no&quot;blame whatsoever can be attached to Mr. Brown for this. There was noimproper motive in the restrictions placed on Mr. Brown and they arosesolely from the passionate love of secrecy inherent in so many minor officials.5. No steps can have been taken to check the accuracy of Mr. Brown&apos;sreport before it was submitted to the Ministry. Mr. Smith knew that thestatement that the Crichel Area had been acquired voluntarily by agreement
was at any rate denied by Lieut. Commander Marten, and it ought therefore to have been re-checked with the Air Ministry ; and Mr. Hole knew that thestatement that the buildings on Hardings&apos; farm were inadequate for theexisting acreage was contrary to Mr. Lofthouse&apos;s report and should there-fore have been rechecked by visiting the Hardings&apos; farm.6. I cannot help inferring that the omission by the Land Commission tosupply the Ministry with a copy of Mr. Hole&apos;s qualifying letter, in which hespecifically drew attention to the financial Objections, when submittingMr. Brown&apos;s report was deliberate and was due to reluctance to call attentionto the financial unsoundness of their decision to equip and let Crichel Downas a self-contained unit. This inference is irresistible in view of Mr. Smith&apos;sletter to the Ministry giving the recommendations of the Land Commissionafter considering Mr. Hole&apos;s letter and Mr. Brown&apos;s report, in which Mr.Smith expressly states that the equipment of Crichel Down as one unit is a:satisfactory proposition from a financial point of view.7. When the Minister came to his decision in December, 1952, that as amatter of policy Criohel Down ought to be equipment:pped and farmed as oneunit the true facts and considerations were not fully brought to his notice.The facts were assumed by the Ministry to have been correctly stated in Mr.Brown&apos;s report which as I have pointed out they were not. Among other things it was assumed that the whole of Crichel Down except the HooperArea (15 acres) had been acquired by voluntary agreement, and. although Mr.Manktelow and Mr. Nugent both sounded a warning note about the financial aspect the true financial position had never been brought to the notice ofanyone in the Ministry.8. In order to enable a proper decision to be made as to whether crichel down ought to be equipped and farmed as one unit or whether it ought tobe sold back to the original owners the following facts should have been-clearly presented to the Minister in a proper brief: (a) The whole of Crichel Down had been compulsorily acquired for defence purposes in the face of strenuous opposition by the ownersat a total cost to the Government of  12,106.(b) The previous owners were anxious to repurchase their respectiveholdings and would have paid a total of about  21,000 for the landin its then condition.(c) The previous owners were all first class farmers and could havebeen relied upon to farm their respective areas properly from their(existing buildings which were adequate for the purpose.(d) It would cost approximately  32,000 to equip Crichel Down as a self-contained unit and when so equipped the maximum rent whichcould possibly be obtained would be about  2,100 per annum ( 3 per acre) gross without allowing for repairs or depreciation, whichwould provide not more than  1,400 net, and that whether or notthis rent could be maintained would depend on the future of agricul-ture generally.(e) A detailed statement by the Ministry&apos;s expert advisers setting outthe respects in which and the extent to which they estimated thatfood production would be increased by equipping Crichel Downand farming it as a single self-contained unit.Whether it is likely that the Ministers decision would have been anydifferent if the full facts and circumstances had been brought clearly and-correctly to his notice is a matter wholly outside the scope of my inquiry.
9. Once it was determined as a matter of policy that Oriohel Downought in the national interest to be equipped and farmed as one unit therewere various ways in which1 this policy could be implemented, namely:  (a) By the Ministry itself equipping the land and continuing to farmit through the Land Commission.ib) By the Ministry itself through the Land Commission equippingthe land and then letting it to a tenant.(c) By the Ministry itself equipping the land and then selling it tosomeone who could be relied upon to retain and farm it as oneunit.id) By the Ministry selling the bare land to someone who could be relied upon to equip it and retain and farm it as one unit.The first course (a) was never considered because it was never the policyof the Land Commission themselves to engage in farming operations if itcould possibly be avoided.The second course ib), although the one originally determined upon bythe Land Commission when the possibility of a sale was thought to be excluded, was financially unsound and a sale of the land was clearlypreferable.The difficulty in the case of both the other courses (c) and (d) was thatit is not possible in law effectively to ensure that a purchaser would eitherequip the land or retain it or farm it. It became necessary, therefore, ifthe land was to toe sold, to ensure that the purchaser was a person who could be relied upon to implement the policy. With an individual this was virtually impossible since, however trustworthy he might be, human lifeInevitably comes to an end and what would happen after his death could-only be a matter of speculation. In these circumstances certainly the best,and probably the only, certain way of ensuring that the purchaser imple-mented the Government Policy was by a sale to Crown Lands, whose policy the Minister himself was in a position to control by virtue of his office asan ex-officio Commissioner.10. Although the proposition of purchasing and equipping the land andthen letting it to a tenant was not a very sound one financially from crown lands point of view, yet, accepting (as of course I must) the policy decision that the land must be equipped and farmed as one unit, it may well havebeen justified as the only feasible method of implementing that policy. Thisagain however appears to me to have been a policy decision for the minister in his capacity of ex-officio Commissioner of Crown Lands and thereforesomething which is excluded from the scope of my inquiry.11.  15,000 was a fair price for the sale of Crichel Down to Crown Landssaddled as it was with the obligation to equip it as a unit; and the time limit Of two months in which to decide whether to purchase or not, imposed on Crown Lands at the request of Sir Frederick Burrows, was a necessary and reasonable one.12. Neither Crown Lands nor Sanctuary &amp; Son were aware of the previousapplications for tenancies until Sanctuary &amp; Son received Mr. Middleton&apos;sletter of 19th March 1953. The failure previously to notify Crown Landsof the position with regard to these applicants was due to Mr. Lofthousehaving vacated the post of Land Service Officer for Somerset and Dorsetbefore Crown Lands came on the scene, and his successor, Mr. Middleton,being himself unaware of the position until he received a further application in March 1953, when the old file was brought to his notice for the first
time. In these circumstances the selection of Mr. Tozer as a prospectivetenant toy Mr. Thomson in February 1953 was perfectly toona fide and,though it would have been more in accord with normal practice andmore satisfactory generally if the tenancy had been offered for public tender,the time limit imposed was probably sufficient to justify the course adopted.13. When Crown Lands were informed of the true position regardingprevious applicants Mr. Thomson was in no way committed to Mr. Tozereven on the strictest moral view, and Mr. Tozer should at once have beeninformed of the position and told that any further negotiations could onlybe regarded as purely tentative pending a ruling from the Ministry as tothe procedure to be adopted. The attitude adopted by Mr. Thomson andMr. Eastwood that they were already too far committed to Mr. Tozerto break off negotiations with him was wholly unjustified, and was dictatedsolely by a determination not to allow anything to interfere with the plansthey had in mind. There is no suspicion of any dishonesty. Mr. Eastwood&apos;shighly improper suggestion that something might be done to mislead the applicants into thinking that their applications had received due considerationspeaks for itself and calls for no further comment.14. When Crown Lands first learnt of the previous applications therewould have been no difficulty whatever in then advertising the tenancy for public tender and so keeping faith with the applicants. When Mr. Wilcoxreceived Mr. Eastwood&apos;s letter showing that Crown Lands did not intend to do this, the matter should at once have been referred to the Ministerfor his directions. Mr. Wilcox was guilty of a grave error of judgment intaking upon himself to tell Crown Lands that they would not be expectedto implement any promises the Lands Service had made. His readyacceptance of Mr. Eastwood&apos;s improper suggestion that something might bedone to mislead the applicants was equally improper, and had he not thoughtthat there might be some such way out of the difficulty it is very unlikelythat he would have been so ready to tell Mr. Eastwood that Crown Landscould ignore the previous applicants.15. It is inevitable that with over 370,000 acres of land to manage thePermanent Commissioner must rely to a very great extent on information and advice from his local officials or Crown Receivers, but Mr. Eastwood&quot;was particularly handicapped in this respect by being new to his appointment and comparatively inexperienced. Mr. Thomson is obviously a strongcharacter and determined to the extent of obstinacy in upholding his own views, and I am convinced that Mr. Eastwood was completely dominated byhim over the Crichel Down project.16. Although strictly outside the scope of this Inquiry, I cannot help feeling that it is a matter for consideration toy the appropriate authorities whetherthe present system of employing local firms of Estate Agents and Surveyorsas Crown Receivers on a part-time basis is satisfactory, and if so whetherthe method of fixing their remuneration for special work such as the crichel down project should be revised.17. Mr. Tozer should never have been allowed to claim dilapidations inthe circumstances of this case, and I can find no reason why Mr. Thomsonshould have pressed the claim so energetically on his behalf or why it wasultimately allowed. When the Land Commission were proposing to offer the tenancy for public tender any claim for dilapidations was expresslyexcluded in the form of tender which had already been prepared.18. Mr. Wilcox&apos;s unnecessary enquiry into the circumstances in whichLieut. Commander Marten obtained licences to build certain cottages threeyears previously was a regrettable lapse from the standard of conduct the
public is entitled to expect from responsible civil servants, and had the unfortunate result of making it appear to the Lands Service that Lieut.Commander Marten had been attempting to deceive the Ministry.19. Mr. Tozer is a first class farmer and in every way a desirable tenant.The rent of  3 per acre which he has agreed to pay for the land when fully equipped is a high one and there is no reason to suppose that any betterrent would have been obtained if the tenancy had been advertised for publictender.20. There was a certain amount of lack of liaison between officials at theMinistry, and some letters were not drafted as clearly or as tactfully as theymight have been, but apart from this and the specific matters concerningMr. Wilcox to which I have already drawn attention there was nothing done at the Ministry itself which calls for comment.21. The Land Commission were a comparatively new body very anxiousto gain experience by trying their hand at a new and interesting venturesuch as equipping Crichel Down as a model farm, and in their eagernessto ensure that they were not deprived of the opportunity they adopted anirresponsible attitude towards the expenditure of public money, and theywere not always as frank with the Ministry as they might have been. Theresponsibility for this lack of frankness appears to fall primarily, at anyrate, on Mr. Smith, and it is unfortunate that he was not available to give evidence as I hesitate to lay the responsibility at his door without havingheard his explanation.22. The Lands Service were equally filled with enthusiasm for this unusualopportunity, though Mr. Hole at any rate adopted a more conscientiousattitude towards the public purse. There was a lamentable exhibition ofmuddle and inefficiency over obtaining the report that was called for inJuly 1952 when Mr. Lofthouse was about to go on leave, and a complete failure by Mr. Lofthouse properly to&apos; instruct Mr. Brown or to make a proper hand over when he did go on leave. Again Mr. Lofthouse does notappear to have put Mr. Middleton fully in the picture when Mr. Middletontook over foam him in December 1952. Apart from this and (the failure ofMr. Hole to check Mr. Brown&apos;s report I have no criticism to make of the lands Service.23. In Crown Lands there is a lack of adequate control over the activitiesof Crown Receivers and a tendency, at any rate in this particular case, toleave everything to ithe Crown Receiver and to accept without questioneverything that he says or does. It is a matter for the consideration ofthe Minister whether he is consulted sufficiently frequently by the PermanentCommissioner on policy matters.24. A most regrettable attitude of hostility to Lieut-Commander Martenwas evinced by Mr. Eastwood, Mr. Wilcox and Mr. Thomson and to a lesser degree by certain other junior officials. There was no excuse whateverfor this attitude. Lieut.-Commander Marten acted perfectly properlythroughout and was merely endeavouring to stand up for what he conceivedto be his moral rights. This attitude was engendered solely by a feeling of irritation that any member of ithe public should have the temerity to oppose or even question the acts or decisions of officials of a Government orState Department. This attitude is in marked distinction to the courtesyand care with which Lieut-Commander Marten&apos;s complaints were treatedand investigated by the Minister himself and Mr. Nugent, and also (naturallyso perhaps) by Mr. Crouch.
25. There was no trace in this case of anything in the nature of bribery,corruption or personal dishonesty ; and once the Ministerial decision thatas a matter of policy Crichel Down must be equipped and farmed as asingle self-contained unit and must be so maintained for the future is accepted, the sale to Crown Lands and the subsequent letting to Mr. Tozercannot of themselves give rise to any legitimate complaint. The procedure adopted, however, was such that it inevitably gave rise to misgivings amonglocal farmers and landowners, and I am satisfied that Lieutt-CoimmanderMarten was fully justified in the circumstances in pressing for a public inquiry.At the close of his case Mr. MeMord Stevenson, Q.C., leading counsel forLieut-Commander Marten and the Honourable Mrs. Marten, Mr. Strange,and Mr. Hooper, asked me to recommend to the Minister that the costs which his clients had incurred by being represented at the Inquiry oughtto be defrayed presumably out of the public purse. As I pointed out to Mr. Melford Stevenson at the time, it would be wholly outside the scopeof my authority to deal in any way with a question of costs. The questionis one that can only be considered by the Minister himself, and I considerthat it would be improper for me to make any recommendation.Andrew Clark,Queeiis Counsel.13th May, 1954.ANNEXURE (1)Crichel Down Public InquiryList of Witnesses (Alphabetical)No.	Name	Party	Status1.
