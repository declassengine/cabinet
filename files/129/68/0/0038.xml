Recruits, menon leave and those returning for discharge, often with their families,I pass through the recruiting and transit depots in India.    These recruit-I ing depots are on a temporary basis and we are committed to closingI them by our five-year agreement with Nepal.    There is strong pressureI on     to doI 2.     If we are to hope for good relations with the Governments ofI Nepal and India, we must start to transfer these recruiting depots insideI {he Nepalese border.    To do this and eventually achieve full independence |^^HI of transit through India means a very large undertaking in a remote| country which presents many difficulties, and where it is hard to estimateI costs and progress.    Nevertheless, the time has now come to make aI decision to start on this programme.?????I 3.     Because of the great importance we attach to keeping the BrigadeI of Gurkhas in being and of the likelihood of a rapid deterioration in ourI relations with India and Nepal if we do not show in a practical way ourintention to start on this project, I ask the Cabinet now to agree:-I (a) that a long-term plan should be drawn up on theassumption that our agreement with Nepal willf^^l continue indefinitely (the full plan might amount toas much as  lj .   2 millions which might be spreadf^^l over a period of about 10 years);(b) that authority should be given for work to proceed onthe basis of this plan until 1958, when our agreementf f V with Nepal comes up for renewal (we estimate that the P-V-Hf^H initial stages would be at the rate of about  100,0001 (c) that in 1958 the whole question be reviewed in the lightI of the situation that then obtains.The War Office, S.W.I.June, 1954.I -i-
ANNEX1 RECRUITMENT OF GURKHAS TO THE BRITISH ARMY&lt; &amp; Introduction^|Gurkhas from amongst the hill tribes of Nepal have beenrecruited for Imperial service for some 150 years.    After the partitionof India and the disbandment of the old Indian Army a meeting was heldat Katmandu in Nepal on 1st May, 1947, attended by representatives of ^^^HHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, the Government ofIndia and the Government of Nepal.    The Prime Minister of Nepal statedthat the Nepalese Government would &quot;welcome the proposal to maintainthe Gurkha connection with the armies of the United Kingdom and India&quot;.2. It was therefore decided to maintain the Brigade of Gurkhas,H consisting of eight Gurkha Rifle battalions and a proportion of supportingarms as a long-term Imperial commitment.    These eight battalions andsupporting arms now form a major part of the Imperial forces deployed inthe Far East.Tripartite Memorandum of Agreement3. On 1st December, 1947, the Minister of Defence made a statementin the House of Commons in which he outlined the terms of the Tripartite ^^^BMemorandum of Agreement of 9th November, 1947, between the Govern- ^^^BI ments of the United Kingdom, Nepal and India.    Amongst other statementshe&quot;The Government of India have agreed to the use by theBritish Army authorities of the existing recruiting depotsI at Lehra and Jalapahar for a temporary period pending theestablishment elsewhere in India or in Nepal of permanentrecruiting depots required by Gurkha units of the BritishArmy. &quot;I These arrangements, which include hospitals, permanent accommoda-tion and storage, are now in use.4. In addition, the Indian Government agreed to grant transit rightsthrough India to the Nepal frontier and to the establishment of a receptioncentre at Barrackpore to handle the movement of Gurkhas. ^^^flDuration of Agreement5. On 1st December, 1947, the Minister of Defence announced in theHouse of Commons:-&quot;Arrangements have been made for the continuedI employment of Gurkha officers and soldiers in the armies ^^^Hof the United Kingdom and of India. &quot;H 6.     Recruitment to the Brigade of Gurkhas is governed by a five-year^^H, I Agreement with the Government of Nepal which expires in 1958. Thereis no reason to believe that this agreement will not be extended to anindefinite period in view of the popularity of the service in the BrigadeI |   of Gurkhas and the economic benefits derived by Nepal.-2-
Imperial requirement ^^^H7. Despite the fact that the Imperial commitment in Hong Kong may be?             reduced, no significant reduction in Malaya can be foreseen in the nearfuture.    Without the Gurkha contribution it will be impossible to meetour commitments in the Far East except at the expense of other Imperialcommitments.    In the long term it is clear that we must retain Gurkhasin Imperial service as long as we can in view of the impending rundownof British manpower in the Services and the consequent reduction inBritish units.    Sooner or later the existence of the Brigade of Gurkhasmay be one factor assisting towards a reduction in the period of nationalRecent developments-,--8. In 1953, in response to Indian political pressure, arrangementswere made to carry out the act of enlistment in Nepal instead of India,although the, Brigade of Gurkhas recruiting organization continued tomake use of the depots at Lehra and Jalapahar on the Indian side of theNepal frontier to complete their documentation and medical examinationand for other administrative purposes.9. Considerable pressure has again recently been placed on the j^^HGovernment of India by left-wing elements to interfere with the recruitmentof British Gurkhas.    This pressure has been resisted, but it is possiblethat it will increase as the Indian elections in 1956 draw near. Thecontinued presence on the Nepalese-Indian border of the Brigade of I^^HGurkhas recruiting organization will provide an excuse for this politicalagitation which can only be countered by evidence of our intention towithdraw from India as early as possible.10. The Indian Government may be forced into a position in which noalternative remains other than to try to influence the Nepalese Governmentagainst renewal of the Agreement in 1958.    No justification, however, wouldexist for this action if we had given evidence of our intention of leavingIndia as soon as possible.11. In 1953 the signing of the five-year Agreement resulted in ourhaving to move the recruiting organization of the Brigade of Gurkhas fromIndia into Nepal.    Apart from fulfilling our obligations under theTripartite Memorandum of Agreement to vacate the existing depots atLehra and Jalapahar, it was felt that the move into Nepal would placeHer Majesty&apos;s Government in a better position, in the future, to negotiatean extension of the Agreement.12. Hence, after the monsoon, a detailed reconnaissance was carriedj               out in Nepal to select sites on which could be built the recruiting depotsto replace those in India at Lehra and Jalapahar.    Sites were selectedfor a main depot at Dharan Bazaar in East Nepal, with a collectingpost at Bhairwa in West Nepal.The proposal13. It is proposed to build a permanent depot at Dharan Bazaar and^^H)H&lt;!/           to improve the existing 29-mile bullock-cart track to Biratnagar into a ^^^Jroad suitable for motor transport.    The depot will include permanentoffice and living accommodation for the staff, for 400 troops and*   families in transit and for 300 recruits.    Up to a further 600 individualsin transit will be accommodated in tents while the present land and sealines of communication continue.    A hospital, wireless station and ^^^Jamenities are also required.I -3- I
14. Should air trooping become possible.in the future the transitL I          arrangements at Barrackpore could be given up, and those required of the ^^^Hpermanent staff at Barrackpore would move to Dharan Bazaar.    An ^^^H,H airfield in fact exists at Biratnagar in the plains, 29 miles from DharanPfj Bazaar, and a subsidiary airfield exists accessible to Bhairwa.15. In addition, a collection centre will be established at Bhairwa,and only occupied during the recruiting season.Estimate of costs16. No reliable estimate of the cost is yet available.17. The work in Nepal is unlikely to be completed before mid-1958,although every effort would be made to accelerate it, in view of theimportance of closing the depots at Lehra and Jalapahar as soon aspossible.18. The principal factors making for delay are the length of timeWMM                   needed to secure the land, as this has to be negotiated with many ownersthrough the Government of Nepal, and the amount of work involved inpreparing plans, drawings and specifications and in placing the necessarycontracts for a project of this size.    There will also be practicaldifficulties in carrying out and supervising work in an undeveloped andremote country where skilled labour is not available and where themonsoon lasts for four months every year.11/   &apos; ^ ?-4-
