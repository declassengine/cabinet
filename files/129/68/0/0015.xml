41(THISWOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)-Vl-.....-..........................-..........................................-\1/ SECRET ^V- - CABINET OFFICE /C.(54) 165 RECORD COPY      COPY NO. DO18th May. 1954CABINETTRANSFER OF THE HIGH COMMISSION territories memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth relations at the end of last week I heard from the same secret source thatgave us timely notice before of Dr. Malan&apos;s intentions that Dr. Malan wasabout to instruct his High Commissioner here to enquire whether theUnited Kingdom Government will be prepared to open discussions at ministerial level at Pretoria in the middle of August about the transferof the Territories.    I understand Dr. Malan&apos;s idea is that the Uniondelegation should consist of Havenga, Donges, the Minister of theInterior, and Verwoerd, Minister for Native Affairs;  the last two arestrong advocates of the apartheid policy.2.        The High Commissioner has now asked to see me.    I shall tell him that I must consult the Cabinet.    I am informing my colleagues atonce so that we may agree the reply I should give.    This memorandum isbased on the assumption that the High Commissioner will presentDr. Malan&apos;s proposal as set out in paragraph 1.    If the High commissioner should offer some variant of that proposal, I will inform my colleaguesbefore the Cabinet meets.3.        Dr. Malan is of course basing himself on the resolution passedby both Houses of the Union Parliament last April in the following terms:-&quot;That this House resolves that the transfer to theUnion of the Government of Basutoland and the Bechuanalandand Swaziland Protectorates, to be administered in accordancewith the terms and conditions embodied in the Schedule to theSouth Africa Act, 1909, or such other terms and conditions asmay be agreed upon between the two Governments concerned,should take place as soon as possible.     This Houseconsequently urges that, with this end in view, immediate steps should be taken towards the resumption of the negotia-tions between the said two Governments at the stage reached at the outbreak of the war in 1939. &quot;4. In my letter to Dr. Malan of 1st April, which was written tohim before he tabled his resolution, and which the Cabinet approved,I said:-&quot;Our Government could not agree to the transfer of the territories at the present time.    Moreover, if a request for transfer is publicly made by the Union Government,either by tabling a resolution or by some other official statement, it would be impossible for the Government of the1-
United Kingdom to avoid declaring their attitude.    Wewould be immediately questioned in Parliament;  and wewould be bound to make our position plain.    It would there-fore be fruitless to embark on any negotiations as proposedin the draft resolution, because it would be clear to every-one in both countries that negotiations on transfer could lead to no practical result. &quot;Notwithstanding this, Br. Malan proceeded with his resolution.5.        Dr. Malan hurried on his debate in the House of Assembly;  andthe Prime Minister and I made our statements in Parliament while theresolution was being debated in the South African Lower House.     (Hansard,13th April. )    We both stated categorically that transfer could not be entertained at the present time.    The Prime Minister added his hope:&quot;that Dr. Malan and his Government, with whom we have hitherto happilyco-operated on so many problems we share in common, will notneedlessly press an issue on which we could not fall in with their viewswithout failing in our trust&quot;.I said in my statement:   &quot;that so far as relations between theadministration of the Territories and the Union authorities are concerned,these are, I believe, working very well.    There is close co-operationover a wide range of practical matters, trade, transport, agriculture,health (human and animal), and development generally......    Theseare the practical things that make for increasing goodwill between theUnion and the Territories.    All these practical matters of day-to-daycollaboration have gone on and developed irrespective of any question of transfer&quot;.6.        If Dr. Malan wished to send a Minister here or to instruct hisHigh Commissioner to talk to us, I do not think we could refuse, though we should again make it plain that any discussion on the main issue wouldbe fruitless at the present time.     We should have to add that it is whollyunrealistic to talk of resuming &quot;negotiations&quot; at the stage reached wherethey left off in 1939.    A great deal has happened since then, and dr. MIalan&apos;s native policy has changed the whole climate.    But I am surewe ought not to send a Minister to South Africa to discuss a matter whichthe United Kingdom Government has stated publicly and categoricallythey cannot entertain.    If we did so our action would be entirely misunder-stood, and we should put ourselves in a most embarrassing position both here aiid in South Africa.7.        I am sure Dr. Malan does not want his Ministers to talk aboutpractical co-operation.    If he asked about that, the answer should bethat these are practical administrative matters, which are and shouldcontinue to be the subject of regular discussion and collaboration betweenthe High Commissioner and his representatives in the Territories andSouth African Ministers and officials on the spot.    But the object of any discussions which Dr. Malan would initiate would be &quot;Transfer&quot;.8.        I have been in consultation with our High Commissioner aboutDr. Malan&apos;s purpose in pressing on with this matter when he knows hecan only court a rebuff.    I think the reason is this.    Provincial electionstake place in the four Provinces of the Union in July and August.    Inthe Cape and the Transvaal political Parties are fairly evenly divided.In those Provinces the coloured voter theme is wearing rather thin;
and Dr. Ivialan may want a new and more popular cry.    ProvincialCouncils elect a large part of the Senate.     If Dr. Malah. could sweep theProvincial Councils, he might have a dissolution and then get the two-thirds majority he wants in a new Parliament.    He might even make theRepublic an issue at the election, though I think that is less likely, for he has always said that if he put the Republic issue at all he would put it as a special subject;  and Havenga told me that on a secret plebiscitehe believed a considerable majority would be against a Republic.9.        None of these considerations deflect me from the advice I havegiven in this memorandum.    I have no doubt that Dr. Malan expects a refusal and he would probably welcome this for local reasons.    TheHigh Commissioner advises that our reply should be on the general linesof my letter of 1st April, which he says would not be easy to exploitlocally, though no doubt Dr. Malan would do his best.    The HighCommissioner says that any reference to the need for consultation withthe native population of the Territories would be seized upon as the best means of inflaming not only the Nationalists but a large number of english-speaking South Africans as well.    I think the High Commissionerappraisal is wise, and I propose that our answer should be that it wouldbe fruitless to open discussions on a subject on which the UnitedKingdom Government have stated that they could not agree at the presenttime.SWINTONCommonwealth Relations Office, S. W. 1.17th May, 1954.
