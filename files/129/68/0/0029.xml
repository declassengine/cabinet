S2-.*&apos;ASECRET-   - CABINET OFFICE itC&apos;(54)179 RECORD COPY      COPY NO&apos;-^28th May, 1954CABINETSAUDI ARABIAN FRONTIER dispute memorandum by the Minister of state in C. (54) 59 I explained the proposition which H,M, ambassador had been instructed to put to the Saudi Government about the pre-conditionsof arbitration.2. The Saudi reply, while accepting the proposition, as a basis for discussion, raised various points to which we could not agree.    but before we could answer it King Saud suggested that we should attempt tonegotiate a settlement of the dispute instead of taking it to arbitration.This we agreed to try to do, but it quickly emerged that the Saudis wereprepared to offer no compromise that we could possibly accept.    Wetherefore reverted to arbitration as a solution.3. At that point (on 23rd May), we heard from the State Depart-ment that Aramco (the American oil company operating in Saudi Arabia)were about to comply with a Saudi request to move prospecting partiesinto the areas in dispute between Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia.4. The facts about these areas are that in 1935 King Ibn Saudclaimed certain territory;  in 1936 a British oil company obtained an option (subsequently converted into a concession) from Abu Dhabi interritory not claimed by King Ibn Saud;  in 1948 their prospecting began to show signs of success; and in 1949 the Saudis claimed a much widerregion, embracing much of the likely oil areas and including those wherethe Iraq Petroleum Company were working.    Throughout this dispute wehave taken the line that, until someone else could be shown to have abetter claim, the Iraq Petroleum Company must stay where it is and thatAramco had no right to encroach.5. It was accordingly made clear to the State Department and tothe Saudi Government that we would not permit Aramco parties to enter the disputed areas and that, if they attempted to do so, they would be inter-cepted and put back again into Saudi Arabia.    The Americans were warned,moreover, that our Levy posts had instructions to use firearms, as a last resort, if the intruders did not stop.    We also urged the Americans tomake representations to the Saudi Government against an ill-consideredmanoeuvre which could only set back the chances of a peaceful settlement.6. We have now heard from the United States Embassy that theirAmbassador at Jedda has been instructed to express to the Saudis the&quot;strong objection&quot; of the United States Government to the use of a UnitedStates Company and United States nationals in so delicate a situation, and-1-
that his Government consider that the proposed incursion would be mostunhelpful at this juncture.    Our latest information is that the Aramcoparty, who had planned to enter the area on 27th May, have postponed theirentry until 29th May.7. Full instructions have been issued to our Levy posts on themanner of dealing with any incursion, and it is hoped that both thePolitical Agent, Trucial States, and Brigadier Baird, Military adviser to the Political Resident, will be on the spot should trouble occur.    Theyare being warned that every effort to carry out their instructions by peaceful means should be made before stronger measures are taken.8. Unless we repel this incursion, the confidence of the rulerswhom we protect will be further shaken.S.L.Foreign Office, S.W.I.28th May, 1954.
