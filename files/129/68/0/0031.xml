(this document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government)-Jl&apos;_____________________.....____....._________-_____-.-----secret CABINET OFFICS:C.(54) 181 RECORD COPY COPY NO- ^31st May, 1954CABINETFUTURE DEFENCE ARRANGEMENTS WITH IRAQMemorandum by the Minister of state the Foreign Office have been considering, in consultation with theChiefs of Staff, the desirability of inviting the Iraqi Government to discussrevised arrangements for mutual defence in the light of:-(i)    a revised strategic concept of a forward strategy for the defence of the Middle East;(ii)   the fact that the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 is due to expire in 1957, and that we shall in all probability be subject to pressure from theIraqis to revise it before then.United Kingdom strategy2.        The revised concept of a forward strategy for the defence of theMiddle East in a major war is based on the power of the United Kingdomand its allies to inflict on the enemy at the outset of hostilities suchdamage by air attack as would, we hope, reduce the land threat to iraq to manageable proportions.    Our intention is &quot;to deploy north-eastwardswith the object of holding the enemy land forces as far forward aspracticable, if possible in the passes leading from Persia to Iraq&quot;.    Inview of these plans, we should be able to convince the Iraqis that effective mutual defence arrangements can be worked out provided thatthere is adequate co-operation between our forces and, in particular,that the Iraqi air bases are capable of being immediately and effectivelyused by the R. A. F. in the event of war.Anglo-Iraqi Treaty3.        The Treaty of 1930, under which we occupy the air bases atHabbaniya and Shaiba, expires in 1957, and either side has been entitledto ask for its revision since 1952.    Article 11 provides that &quot;the highcontracting parties will, at the request of either of them, conclude anew treaty which will provide for the continued maintenance and protection in all circumstances of the essential communications ofHis Britannic Majesty&quot;.4.        The Treaty, being a survival of the Mandatory period, is notpopular in Iraq, and successive Iraqi Governments have been under strong pressure to secure its abrogation and the return of the air bases toIraqi ownership.    In view of the fate of the Portsmouth Treaty (a revisionof the present Treaty, signed in 1948, but rejected by the Regent of Iraq
after serious riots in Bagdad), no Iraqi Government is likely to be willingto negotiate a new formal treaty granting the United Kingdom military facilities in Iraq.    Nevertheless, it seems likely that we should have agood chance of obtaining in practice the essential facilities we require inorder to defend Iraq and strengthen the flank of the North Atlantic treaty organisation, if we take an early opportunity of inviting the Iraqis toexamine with us our mutual defence requirements in the light of UnitedKingdom strategic plans and on the basis of returning Habbaniya andShaiba to Iraqi ownership.5.        Further arguments for taking the initiative with a view toreplacing the Treaty by other arrangements are:-(i)    The Iraqis are likely to make a formal request to us for the abrogation of the Treaty and the return Ofthe bases as soon as there is an outcome to our negotiations with Egypt, and perhaps before.    Ifwe fail to reach agreement with Egypt, it isdoubtful whether the Iraqi Government would offer us facilities of a kind which the Egyptianshad refused in the Canal Zone.(ii)    In view of United States interest in the &quot;northern tier&quot;of Middle Eastern states, as shown in the Turco-Pakistan Pact and the agreement for United states military aid to Iraq, the Iraqis and others may getthe idea that we are leaving it to the Americans tomake the running in that part of the world, unless we ourselves take steps to put our military relationswith Iraq on a footing acceptable to both sides.Facilities we should attempt to secure in Iraq6.        H. MI. Ambassador at Bagdad regards it as a political sine qua nonthat the bases should be returned to Iraqi ownership and that we should give up the right to station operational units permanently in Iraq, though they might be admitted for long training periods.    Subject to this condition, the facilities which we should hope to secure may be listedas follows(i)   Regular visits by R.A. F. squadrons to Habbaniyaand Shaiba, so contrived that there should normally be one R.A.F. squadron in Iraqavailable for defence or training purposes.(ii) The provision of British technicians to maintain the bases in such a way that they would immediately be available for full operational use in war.    it remains to be seen whether the Iraqis would agree to the retention of British uniformedpersonnel for this purpose;  if not, it might bepossible to make arrangements for themaintenance of the bases by civil contractors,as is being done in Libya.(iii) Pre-stocking of supplies and equipment in Iraq forthe land and air forces that we intend to deploythere at the outbreak of war.
(iv)    Transit and staging facilities for R.A. F. aircraftthrough. Iraq in peace-time.(v)    Standardisation of equipment and co-ordination ofBritish and Iraqi operational and logisticplanning in peace-time for the defence ofIraq in war.(vi)    The wide range of facilities that an ally would normally expect in the event of war or threat of war.Method and timing of approach to Iraqi government.        H. M. Ambassador suggests that, after he has cleared the way with the King and Crown Prince of Iraq, we should propose to the iraqi government (or perhaps only to the Prime Minister) that military representatives of the two sides should hold secret discussions with aview to working out arrangements for mutual defence.    When agreement has been reached on the military level, Her Majesty&apos;s Government should consult with the Iraqi Government (or perhaps with a specially appointedall-party delegation) as to the form in which the agreement should be embodied.     Instead of a formal treaty, there might, for example, be adeclaration by the two Governments announcing the termination of theTreaty and the return of the bases, and indicating (without a specifictime-limit) the revised arrangements for the maintenance of the bases,R.A. F. visits for training purposes, etc.    H. M. Ambassador considersit important that our military representatives at the proposed talksshould be in a position to furnish a clear statement of their detailedrequirements as outlined in paragraph 6 above;  and that we should adopta forthcoming attitude over the financial implications of the transfer ofthe bases.8.        The timing of our approach is affected by the present politicalsituation in Iraq.    The present caretaker Government propose to holdelections on 9th June, and the resulting Government would no doubt wishto take stock of their position before being ready to start a majornegotiation with us.    H. M. Ambassador thinks, however, that if it is decided definitely to start talks with the Iraqis on the above lines, itmight be desirable for him to give the Crown Prince a hint of our intention before the elections, so that he is aware of the desirabilityof choosing a Prime Minister strong enough to get the resulting arrange-ments through Parliament.    H. M. Ambassador does not expect thatthe military talks could begin before about November, since in october the Iraqi military representatives who would be required to take partin the talks will be attending the annual manoeuvres.Re c ommendation9.        I recommend that:-(i)    We should decide in principle to approach the iraqi Government on the lines of paragraphs 6to 8 above, and that H. M. Ambassador shouldbe authorised to give the Crown Prince a hintof our intentions before the June elections.
(ii)   At a suitable moment, for example when themilitary discussions begin, we should inform the United States Government ofour intentions and impress on them once more the importance of their respecting ourpredominance in Iraq and backing our efforts to secure facilities essential to the generaldefence of the West.S. L.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.29th May, 1954.
