SECRET CABINET office.(54) 162 RECORD COPY copy no. ^ 1llth May, 1954cabinetPOSSIBLE INCREASES IN RATES OF PENSIONS AND benefits memorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National insurance on 13th April the Cabinet invited me to submit,(C. C. (54) 28th Conclusions, Minute 5) after consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, an outline of the following alternative schemes -(1)  an interim scheme, dealing only with benefit ratesand contributions, which could be put into forcein January, 1955, consistent with any recommendations that the Phillips Committeewere likely to make;(2)  an interim scheme, to come into force in June, 1955,dealing not only with benefit rates and contributionsbut with some of the matters now underconsideration by the Phillips Committee.2, I have consulted the Chancellor of the Exchequer and weboth agree that the best course would be to introduce a single scheme ata later stage incorporating any acceptable recommendations from thePhillips Committee rather than to announce an interim schemeimmediately, to be followed by a further scheme not long afterwards.If we can get at least an interim report from the Phillips Committee byNovember it should be possible to legislate early in 1955 in the light ofthe Committee&apos;s recommendations and to bring a new scheme intooperation in the summer of 1955.3. If the choice were for an interim scheme for operation bythe end of this year, the decision would have to be made at once because it takes at least six months to get the necessary new pension order books and stamps printed and brought into use.    Owing to the rush at my offices in the early months of the year from sickness benefit claims, I could not undertake the heavy work of introducing new rates of pensions during thelatter part of December or the months of January to April.Interim Scheme for Operation by the End of the Year4. For this purpose all that is possible is a simple raising of the main national insurance rates; I suggest from 32s. 6d. to 37s. 6d.a week for a single person and from 21s. 6d. to 23s. 6d. for a wife,making 61s. for a married couple compared with 54s. now, with appropriate increases in other rates.    This would more than compensate for the increase in the official cost of living and retail prices index since1946.    It would not alter the conditions of the scheme and would not be
inconsistent with any likely findings of the Phillips Committee; nor would it prejudice the statutory review of benefit rates which I shallhave to make following the Government Actuary!s Quinquennial Reportlater this year.5. There would of course be pressure to increase warpensions and industrial injuries benefits at the same time as national insurance benefits, and I think we should have to make correspondingchanges.    I propose that the basic war pension and industrial injuriesdisablement pension for 100 per cent disability should go up from 55s.to 65s. a week, with appropriate&quot; adjustments in other rates.    I do notthink it necessary to suggest any change in the rate of family allowances.6. These increases in insurance benefits would call for thefollowing increases in weekly contributions  -Man W omanEmployedSelf-employedNon-employed+ Shared with employer and including the increasein industrial injuries insurance contribution.7. The Exchequer supplement to national insurance contributions under the two schemes, which was reduced by over 30 millions a year in 1951, would be increased by about  9 millions a year.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated in C. (54)139 that therewould be a further potential burden upon the Exchequer by loss of revenue from tax allowances on the higher contributions: the Inland Revenueestimates that this would amount to about  11 millions a year in so faras the cost was not passed on to the consumer.    The Exchequer wouldalso bear the whole cost of the war pensions increase estimated at about  10 millions a year.    On the other hand there would, it isestimated, be a saving to the Exchequer of about  17 millions in expenditure on national assistance; as the Chancellor stated in C. (54)139there would no doubt be pressure to raise the national assistance scale,but there has already been a generous increase in that scale, and, solong as the cost of living remains stable, I see no justification for afurther increase.8. I estimate that my proposals would cost the national insurance Fund about  72 millions a year, rising to  105 millions a yearby 1967 and to  120 millions by 1977.    Against these sums theadditional yield in contributions and Exchequer supplement payable to theFund would be at a constant rate of between  60 millions and  65 millions.At the outset the income of the Fund (including the additional contributionreceipts) would be sufficient to meet the increased outgoing, but in ayear or two, as has always been contemplated, a deficiency would begin to open up between the income and expenditure of the National insurance fund.    This deficiency is estimated with existing rates to reach 274 millions a year by 1967 and  417 millions a year by 1977, and my proposals would increase that deficiency by  41 millions by 1967 and by 58 millions by 1977.    (The invested balances of the National insurance fund and the Reserve Fund now amount to over  1,400 millions).    Theincreased cost to the Industrial Injuries Fund would be about  4 millions a year at the outset, which would be more than covered by the additional contributions mentioned in paragraph 6.ls.3d.T Is. 0d7Is. Od. lOd.8d. 6d.
3^Interim Scheme for Operation in the Summer of 19559. I understand that the Treasury have consultedSir Thomas Phillips and that he is unable at present to indicate thenature of the recommendations his Committee may make regarding thefuture of retirement pensions.    We hope that at least an interim report may be forthcoming by November so that decisions about legislation could be reached early in the new year.    One possibility is that theCommittee will recommend some raising of the minimum pension age at which retirement pensions would normally become payable in future.If public opinion can be brought to accept a higher conventional minimum age of retirement we shall have to consider the most acceptable methodof bringing it about, but I do not think there is any point in my trying todevelop proposals along these lines until we see what the PhillipsCommittee are going to recommend.10. I ought also to remind my colleagues that by the end ofthe year the Government Actuary will have made his Quinquennial Reporton the finances of the National Insurance Fund and the adequacy of thecontributions now charged.    I shall then be required, as Minister, to review the rates of benefit to be paid in future and under the terms of theAct I must conduct this review in relation11  (a) to the circumstances at the time of insuredpersons in Great Britain, including inparticular the expenditure which is necessaryfor the preservation of health and workingcapacity;   and(b) to any changes in those circumstances since therates and amounts of benefit were laid downby this Act or any Act amending it and to the likelihood of future changes. 11I do not think that I can at this stage anticipate the proposals that I mayhave to make following the review.Unemployability Supplement11. The Cabinet approved in principle on 3rd March an increaseof 10s. a week in the rate of &quot;unemployability supplement&quot; payable to war pensioners, and in the rate of allowance payable to men whose industrial injuries render them permanently incapable of work; and they asked theChancellor of the Exchequer and myself to decide when the increases should be announced.    The Chancellor and I feel that it would on thewhole be unwise to introduce this limited improvement at the presentmoment and that it would be better to defer it for possible incorporation in the later scheme.O.P.Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance,w.c.2.,11th May, 1954.
