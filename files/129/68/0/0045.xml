Printed for the Cabinet; June 1954CABINET \0F&apos;F1CE Copy No.RECORD COPYCABINETUNITED NATIONS DISARMAMENT COMMISSION SUB-committee memorandum by the Minister of StateMy colleagues may wish to have some information about the work of theSub-Committee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission, which has beenmeeting in London since 13th May.2. C. (54) 161 gave an account of the establishment of the Sub-Committee;and, before it began its work, the four Western Powers agreed that the policy tobe adopted would be that set out in paragraphs 5-7 of that paper.3. The Sub-Committee has held fourteen meetings. Canada is represented by the High Commissioner in London, Mr. Robertson, France by M. Jules Moch,the U.S.S.R. by the Soviet Ambassador in London, M. Malik, the United states by Mr. Morehead Patterson, an industrialist specially appointed for the purpose,and the United Kingdom by myself.4. In my opening speech I suggested that there were three main groups of problems to be discussed: the first was the field to be covered by a disarmamenttreaty, the second was the nature and functions of the international control organand the third the phasing of any programme of disarmament.5. In connection with the first group of problems the United Kingdom tableda paper inviting the Sub-Committee to consider precisely what should be coveredby the disarmament treaty, what weapons should be prohibited and what shouldbe reduced. It also suggested that the Sub-Committee should consider whetherall armed forces of all kinds should be included and how they should be defined;whether there should be any kind of budgetary limitation; and, finally, whether there should be any attempt to control propaganda. I indicated that I thoughtagreement on these matters should be comparatively easy to reach, and statedthat we would then be willing to discuss the extent of any reductions. This paperreceived support from the Western delegates but the Soviet delegate refused todiscuss it.6. There has followed prolonged discussion on the second group of problemsconcerning the nature and functions of a control organ. I tabled a number of questions seeking to clarify the Soviet position on the nature of an international control organ. The Soviet Government had put forward certain ideas in June,1947, in the Atomic Energy Commission, and these had been resuscitated by theSoviet delegate in the Sub-Committee. My questions were designed to find outwhether there had&apos;been any modification in the Soviet Governments attitude since1947 which would make their proposals any more acceptable as a basis of agree-ment. The replies showed that there had been no substantial change. Inparticular the Soviet Union would deny the control organ any injunctive powersSECRETC. (54) 195,    715th June, 195446285

Government insist that all recommendations for action in thecase of proved violations should be subject to the approval of the Security Counciland so to the veto. The Soviet delegate also made it clear that the Soviet Govern-ment would refuse to allow the control organ to be in position before any agreedprohibitions and reductions began to come into effect. The Western ideas onthe nature and functions of the control organ were embodied in a paper tabled by the United States Delegation, but the Soviet delegate refused to discuss it indetail, characterising such discussion as a waste of time.7. Of course the crux of the whole matter is whether any effective controlover nuclear weapons is feasible. Owing to the attitude of the Soviet representa-tive, no worth-while discussion of this has been possible.8. The Sub-Committee has now begun discussion of the third group of problems. The basis of discussion is a paper (Annex) which the French and united Kingdom Delegations will formally table in the Sub-Committee. Thelines on which it is drawn have been endorsed by the Foreign Secretary and bythe Chiefs of Staff, It has general Canadian and United States support. this paper was discussed in a preliminary manner on 8th June when it was described by M, Malik as being in essence the same as previous papers tabled by the western powers.  He asked, however, for three days to consider it in detail.9. The Anglo-French paper is in fact a presentation in a somewhat differentform of the line we have consistently adopted in the past. Briefly it is proposedthat the Disarmament programme should be effected in three main stages. Thefirst stage would include the constitution and positioning of the control organ anda freezing of overall&quot;military man-power and expenditure. The second stage would follow as soon as the control organ reported that it was able effectively to enforce it and would consist of one-half of any agreed reductions of conven-tional armaments and armed forces and, on the completion of these reductions,the cessation of the manufacture of all kinds of nuclear weapons. The final stage would follow as soon as the control organ reported that it was able effectively toenforce it and would consist of the completion of the agreed reductions ofconventional armaments and armed forces and immediately thereafter the totalelimination of nuclear weapons.10. To sum up, although the talks have been conducted in a cordial manner,no progress at all has yet been made towards agreement. On the other hand, weare building up a strong case to show that the responsibility for this failure lies with the Soviet Union.- &apos; &apos; S. L.
annex memorandum BY THE FRENCH AND UNITED KINGDOMDELEGATIONSThe French and United Kingdom delegations submit the following proposalsa possible basis for compromise:  1. The members of the Sub-Committee regard themselves as prohibitedin accordance with the terms of the Charter of the United Nations from theuse of nuclear weapons except in defence against aggression. They recom-mend that the Disarmament Treaty should include an immediate and explicitacceptance of this prohibition by all signatory States, pending the total prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons. They further recommendthat the obligations assumed by the members of the United Nations to refrainin their international relations from the threat or use of force against theterritorial integrity or political independence of any State should be acceptedby all signatory States not members of the United Nations.2. The draft disarmament treaty prepared by the Disarmament Corn-mission and submitted by it to the Security Council, to the General assembly and to the World Disarmament Conference should include provisions covering the following:  (a) The total prohibition of the use and manufacture of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction of every type, together with the conversion of existing stocks of nuclear weapons for peacefulpurposes.(b) Major reductions in all armed forces and conventional armaments.(c) The establishment of a control organ with rights and powers and functions adequate to guarantee the effective observance of the agreed prohibitions and reductions.3. After the approval of the draft treaty by the World DisarmamentConference this instrument would be open to signature and adherence by all states. The treaty would enter into force immediately it had been ratified by those of the signatories who would be specified in the treaty.4. The treaty should provide that the disarmament programme should becarried out as described below.5. After the constitution and positioning of the Control Organ, whichshall be carried out within a specified time, and as soon as the Control Organreports that it is able effectively to enforce them, the following measures shallenter into effect:  (a) Overall military man-power shall be limited to 31st December, 1953,levels.(b) Overall military expenditure, both atomic and non-atomic, shall belimited to amounts spent in the year ending 31st December, 1953.6. As soon as the Control Organ reports that it is able effectively toenforce them, the following measures shall enter into effect:  (a) One half of the agreed reductions of conventional armaments and armed forces shall take effect.(b) On completion of (a) the manufacture of all kinds of nuclear weapons and all other prohibited weapons shall cease.7. As soon as the Control Organ reports that it is able effectively toenforce them, the following measures shall enter into effect:  (a) The second half of the agreed reductions of conventional armaments and armed forces shall take effect;
(6) On completion of (a):  A .________(i) The total elimination of nuclear weapons and the conversionof existing stocks of nuclear materials for peaceful purposesshall be carried out;, 7, (ii) The total elimination of all other prohibited weapons shall, be1  &quot; carried out.8. It is to be hoped that when all the measures enumerated above havebeen carried out, the armaments and armed forces of the Powers will be further reduced to the levels strictly necessary for the maintenance of internal security and the fulfilment of the obligations of signatory States under the terms ofthe United Nations Charter.9. The Control Organ shall remain in being to ensure that the reductions,prohibitions and eliminations are faithfully and permanently observed.
