Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs

I circulate for the information of my colleagues the annexed letter which I have recently received from H.M. Ambassador in Paris, Sir Gladwyn Jebb.

4TH JUNE, 1954.
29th May, 195U.My dear Secretary of State,If I may say so with respect, I think that some sort of&quot;Palestine&quot; solution of the Indo-Chinese problem, involving a partition, is the best that we can reasonably hope for.Prom what Bi&amp;aUlt said to us both on 22nd May I understood thathe also favoured some such solution, though I must admit thathis latest plan throws some doubt on this.      Anyway I assume that I am right in thinking that a &quot;Palestine&quot; solution is what would be involved, in such a settlement, i.e. the &quot;bufferstate&quot; would be under Viet Minh control and would be confined,if possible, to Northern Vietnam0     Southern Vietnam, Laos andCambodia would be on our side of the line and be guaranteed by the South-East Asian Defence organisation and preferablyactually members of it.     If in the above I have misunderstoodyour thinking, It&apos; would be very helpful for me to know whereI have gone wrong.I wish I could give you with any confidence an estimateof what is now likely to happen in the Government and Parliamenthere&apos; about the two largest problems of French external policy,Indo-China and the European Defence Coinmunity (E.D.C, ),      Atthe moment the main hope naturally is that, thanks to your-untiring efforts at Geneva, the &quot;other side&quot; may put forwardsome reasonable and acceptable scheme for an Armistice.      Ifthis happens within the next fortnight or so and Monsieur Bidaultcan be persuaded to accept, then I would be quite optimisticas regards developments here.      If it does not happen anyforecast that I attempt is bound to be discouraging.As I say, unless I have misunderstood your   thought, a feature&apos;- and even the major feature of any such reasonablescheme - would be the establishment of some &quot;buffer state&quot; inNorthern Vietnam.     Although it would certainly be a blow to french pride to have to accept a &quot;buffer&quot;, i.e. Chinesesatellite, state in Tonkin, I think that it would theoreticallybe possible to get parliamentary approval here for such asolution, provided it was part of a settlement which wasotherwise reasonably satisfactory from the French point ofview.      To make the settlement satisfactory for France itwould, I think, be essential that the three countries on-our side of the line should remain members of the French Union(with no &quot;right to secede&quot;) and that France should retainprimary responsibility for co-ordinating the political andeconomic aid from the Free World without which they could hardly exist.      This responsibility should however involveFrance in the minimum of men and money, and, therefore, themaximum foreign (i.e. American) material support should be forthcoming,A decision to accept a Viet Minh state in Tonkin would,however, be.-an extremely difficult one for any FrenchGovernment to take.      It is very hard to believe that it couldbe taken by the present Government, which now appears to beon its last legs, struggling from one Vote of Confidence to thenext.     If it was confronted with such a decision, I shouldindeed expect it to collapse,     I suppose however that itmight be possible to obtain an&apos;Armistice without necessarilyevacuating the whole of Tonkxfe, anyhow at once, the FrenchUnion forces Being concentrated in a limited bridgehead.Provided the bridgehead was a fairly large one and included
Hanoi, I think that Bidault could obtain parliamentary approval for an Armistice on these terms.     In these circumstances theLaniel Government might conceivably survive its present difficulties and be able to turn its attention to the E.D. 0, ,although.no one can be certain that it would not then break upon that issue, being deserted by the Gaullists and some of theRadicals,As an immediate practical issue the question is, however,would it be possible to get agreement on a bridgehead includingHanoi?     Do you not think it likely that the &quot;other side&quot; willnot accept an Armistice until they hold Hanoi?     It is con-ceivable that the French Government may decide to evacuateHanoi and concentrate on a smaller bridgehead- round Haiphong,,But again it seems to me unlikely that the Laniel Governmentin its present state could face what would also be politicallya very difficult decision.Owing to the leak to the &quot;Express&quot; we now have the substance of the Ely Report.     Briefly it is to the effect that theGovernment should ask the Assembly at once to pass a lawauthorizing the use of conscripts in Indo-China so that largereinforcements may be sent to Cochin China within four weeks,thus liberating other troops for the defence of the Hanoi-Haiphong area.     Since a full-dress debate on Indo-China&apos;will begin on 1st June and continue during the following week, itseems clear that the Government will have to inform Parliamentof its decisions on General Ely1s Report immediately afterWhitsun,     The Government may decide to ask for approval ofEly&apos;s recommendation about the use of conscripts, but my guessis that, unless this proposal was accompanied by a firmprospect of United States&apos;  aid on land in the near future,it would be rejected by the Assembly,,      if United Statesintervention is arranged, of course a new situation will arisesbut if it is not (which seems more likely) then the prospects of the Government seem to be dim.If, nevertheless, the Government survived or if it decided not to ask for conscripts at all, it would have to face &quot;thequestion whether&apos;or not it should attempt to hold Hanoi, aswell as Haiphong, without the forces which Ely considersessential for the purpose.     My present guess is that, being unable to take an any more painful decision, the Governmentwould decide to try to hold in Tonkin a perimeter smaller than that round the whole Delta, but including Hanoi, and woulddenude other parts of Indo-China for the purpose and send out such reinforcements as it could scrape together.     They would at the same time demand, and perhaps receive, increased american support, especially in the supply of aircraft:    and possibly also promises of direct United States air intervention if theFrench position in the Tonkin bridgehead becomes acutelycritical,,In these circumstances perhaps it is not too pessimisticto expect that there may well be no agreement at Geneva, the&quot;other side&quot; dragging out the negotiations in the confident(and probably justified) expectation that, failing Americanintervention, they can take Hanoi in about three months1 timeand then impose much more severe terms on the French.     After atthe most a few weeks from now the Laniel Government would inevitably fall and&apos;it would probably take at least a month,perhaps much longer, to form another Government,     TheParliamentary Recess would then be upon us and there could hardly be any question of a debate on the .E. D.C.  before the
4rautumn.     In any case the new Government, being probably facedwith a major disaster in Tonkin, would almost certainly lackeither the time or the will to drive the E0D0Ce  through anarrowly divided Parliament.     By that time we shall presumablyhave decided that some other solution of the problem of german rearmament must be found.All these gloomy reflections only show how important it isto reach some agreed solution at Geneva soon.     If thathappened the whole landscape could be transfigured.     For thatpurpose the threat of American intervention may well be effective;   but&quot; Heaven knows what might happen if the threatwere carried out.     The operation could well be successful andthe patient die.     Alternatively no solution and no interven-tion could mean further French disasters which would haveunpredictable, but certainly bad, effects in Paris, possiblyinvolving the future of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.Rarely can a Foreign Secretary have had heavier res-responsibilities,Yours ever,(Signed).
