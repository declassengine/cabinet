IIS]secret cabinet office. (54) 184 record  copy COPY NO.1st June, 1954CABINETEXPENSES OF MEMBERSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerAll I can do in this Paper is to set out a number of points which must be decided if the Government accept the majority decisionof the House as expressed in the Motion passed on 24th May.    At the instance of some of my colleagues I have also examined every permut-ation and combination of expenses schemes.     I will contribute anyobservations on this or any-other aspect orally.Steps to be taken if the majority decision of the House isto be implemented2. A Supplementary Estimate must be presented soon covering the extra cost during this financial year of an increase from  1,000 to 1,500 in Parliamentary salary.    As my colleagues know. SummerSupplementary Estimates are normally presented in July, are put fromthe Chair with the main Estimates (Class by Class) when the guillotinefalls on the last but one Allotted Supply Day, and are given statutory effect by the Appropriation Act passed just before the Summer Recess.3. I have been asked whether Conservative opponents of theincrease will have an opportunity of opposing the Supplementary Estimatein Debate and in the Division Lobby.    The short answer is that such anopportunity is normally provided by the Opposition choosing to have the supplementary Estimate put down for Debate on one of their Supply Days.Another - but an undesirable - possibility is that we put down the supplementary on a day in Government time outside the ordinaryAllotted Supply Days.Operative Date of the Increase4. No doubt we shall discuss this, but the date must be decidedbefore the Supplementary Estimate is presented.     Following the precedents of 1937 and 1946 (of which a brief note is in Appendix I), theGovernment should make an early announcement saying that the supplementary will provide for the increase to take effect as from 1st June or 1st July.ministers. If we are agreed that the right course is to prescribe that all ministers in the Commons may draw the full Parliamentary salary of 1,500 in addition to their Ministerial salaries, we could present thenecessary legislation during the next week or two, if time can be found.
l3oThe Bill will, I understand, be short and simple;  and it should not take upmuch time, though for technical reasons it would require a resolution ofthe House before Second Reading as well as the normal money Resolutionafterwards.    The operative date of the provision should in this case bethe same as the operative date of the increase in the Members&apos; salary.That would follow the precedent of 1946, when legislation enabled junior ministers to draw  500 of their Parliamentary salary with effect from 1st April, 1946.6. There is also the point that the extra expenditure broughtabout by the Bill must be provided for by a Supplementary Estimate on theHouse of Commons Vote, just like the extra expenditure on the salaries ofother M.P&apos;s.    There is everything to be said for covering the two pro-visions by the same Supplementary Estimate, instead of having a secondSupplementary on the same Vote later in the year.     It would be necessaryfor the Bill to be presented (presentation in dummy would do) before the supplementary Estimate is presented, and for the Bill to be passed not later than the Appropriation Act this Summer.7. The Bill would enable Ministers to draw the full parliamentary salary in addition to their Ministerial salary.     It would not alter the amountof the latter, and would thus not determine either way the question of re-storing to  5,000 the Ministerial salaries now abated to  4,000.    I will raise orally the question of extending the right to draw parliamentary salary to those Ministers whose Ministerial salary already exceeds  5,000.8. If time cannot be found before the end of July for this legislation, then we should have to defer the Bill till the Autumn.   It wouldnot be necessary in that case to present a Supplementary Estimate tocover the cost for Ministers till the Spring.     Once the Bill was passed itwould be normal to find the extra money for the intervening months fromthe Civil Contingencies Fund.Mtembers&apos; Fund9. The main statutory provisions governing the Members1 Fundcan be amended by affirmative Resolution of the House of Commons.Such a Resolution could increase the statutory deduction from Members&apos;salaries (e.g. from  12 to  24, as proposed by the Select Committee);could amend the financial limits which are imposed on the amount of reliefthe Trustees can give in individual cases;  or could increase (within limits)the special appropriation out of which the Trustees may meet special casesof hardship without regard to those limits.     On the other hand, an exchequer contribution to the Members1 Fund would require legislation(see Appendix II).10. The Government cannot decide what should be done about theMembers1 Fund until the Trustees have produced their views in response to the invitation of the House.     I understand that they are already con-sidering various schemes and are likely to be ready with their viewshortly after Whitsun.     It might be as well for me to find out informallyhow their minds are moving before they publish anything.    Considerationof the problem by the Government is bound to take some time, particularly if the Trustees ask for an Exchequer contribution.    This part of theproblem could well be left over till after the Summer Recess.11. One minor point arises here.    If Members get the increase of 500 in their salaries and it is later proposed to double their compulsorycontribution to the Members&apos; Fund, there may well be some opposition.I the refore think that, when a Government statement is made about the
forthcoming Supplementary Estimate, it should be made clear that, in agreeing to implement the will of the House, the Government assume thatthe House accepts the possibility that out of the increased salary there maybe an increased contribution to the Members&apos; Fund.Summary12. The order of events, therefore, all on the assumptionmentioned in paragraph 1, and on the further assumption that time can befound in the near future for a short Bill about Ministers would be asfollows:-(i) An early Government statement saying  (a) that they propose to accept the majority decision of the House about an increase in Parliamentary salary and about legislationregarding Ministers;  (b) that a Supplementary Estimatecovering the extra cost of both measures, effective from such date as we decide, will be presented in due course;(c) that the necessary legislation regarding Ministers willbe introduced very shortly;  (d) that the Government under-stand that the Trustees of the Members&apos; Fund are alreadyconsidering the pension proposals;   (e)  that considerationof this matter by the Trustees and the Government is boundto take some time, but meanwhile the House will understandthat one of the possibilities is an increase in the presentcompulsory contribution to the Fund.(ii) Presentation of a Resolution and a Bill allowingMinisters in the Commons to draw the Parliamentary salary.(iii) Presentation of a Supplementary Estimate coveringboth ordinary M.P&apos;s. and Ministers.(iv) MIeanwhile consideration of the pension proposals willbe proceeding.     But it is not necessary to take decisions onthis for some months.13. If the Bill about Ministers has to be deferred, the Statementoutlined above and the subsequent order of events would be alteredaccordingly.R.A.B.&quot;Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.1st June, 1954.APPENDIX IPRECEDENTS FOR INCREASES IN MEMBERS&apos; SALARIES1946The increase from  600 to  1,000 in 1946 was founded on aGovernment statement followed by a Motion proposed by the Government,in both of which an operative date of 1st April, 1946 was proposed.    the motion was passed on 29th May, 1946, and the Supplementary Estimatewas presented with the summer batch.,&apos;. -3-    \
A Government Motion proposed an increase from  400 to 600 with no mention of an operative date.    That Motion was passed on22nd June, 1937 (an amendment to defer the increase being defeated),and on 24th June the Government announced its intention to introduce a supplementary Estimate providing for the increase with effect from 1st July, 1937.APPENDIX IITHE MEMBERS1 fund the Members&apos; Fund is governed by two Acts.    The generalstructure is:-(1)  From every Member&apos;s salary there is a compulsorydeduction of  12, which does not rank for tax-relief.All Ministers in the Commons must similarly contribute.(2)  The Trustees may, at their discretion, make payments to ex-Members, their widows (or widowers) or their orphanchildren, within certain stated limits.     For instance, thegrant to an ex-Member cannot exceed  250 and must not raise the recipients total income above  325.    The manner of computing total income is at the Trustees&apos; discretion.No payment may be made to an ex-Member unless he is over60 or is incapable of earning his living;  nor, save in special cases, tnless he sat in the House for ten years or more.(3)  The Trustees may meet special cases of hardshipwithout regard to the above limits and conditions, but onlyout of a special appropriation from the Fund, which is limited to  3,000 (capital).An affirmative resolution could increase the  12 contributionunder (1), or loosen the financial limits under (2).    A resolution can alsoin any year supplement the appropriation under (3) for meeting special cases of hardship, by appropriating not more than 10 per cent of thatyear&apos;s income from Members&apos; contributions.     For any of these threepurposes therefore legislation would not be necessary.But the principle of the Acts is that no charge is to fall on public funds, and there is no doubt that legislation would be needed inorder to authorise an Exchequer contribution to the Fund, whetherrecurrent or not.
