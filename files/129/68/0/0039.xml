Printed for the Cabinet. June 1954CONFIDENTIAL nAry Copy No.- CAB/NET CPF/CrC (54) 189 RECORD C0Py4th June, 1954CABINETTHE QUEBEC AGREEMENTNote by the Secretary of the CabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister I circulate for the information of theCabinet the attached article, on the constitutional aspect of the Quebec agreement,which appeared in the Saturday Evening Post of 15th May, 1954.(Signed)        NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,3rd June, 1954.
Saturday Evening Post15th May, 1954&quot;THAT A-BOMB PACT NEARLY HOG-TIED us if former Prime Minister Attlee had read the Supreme Courfs opinion in thePink case, which was handed down in 1942, the history of American control overthe development of atomic energy might have been quite different.Sir Winston Churchill, under heavy pressure from his Labor opposition,revealed last month that at Quebec in 1943 he and President Roosevelt made anagreement which provided, among other things, that the atomic bomb would notbe used against a third party by either the United States or Great Britain withoutthe other&apos;s consent. In 1950, Attlee, apparently alarmed lest Truman shouldenlarge the Korean war by dropping an atomic bomb, flew to this country to protest, but felt himself helpless because Congress had passed the McMahon bill(1946) forbidding the export of information on atomic matters. The agreementwith England was cancelled, or at least modified, in 1948.With greater knowledge of the American Constitution, which declares thattreaties are the supreme law of the land, and of the Supreme Courfs dictum in thePink case that &quot; international compacts and agreements .... have a similardignity,&quot; Mr. Attlee might have raised the point before the McMahon Act waspassed that under the Roosevelt-Churchill agreement Congress had no right to deprive Great Britain of atomic information. Indeed, Senator McMahon wasquoted by Churchill as saying that, had he known of the Quebec agreement, hewould not have introduced his bill. But Mr. Attlee, apparently never dreamingthat any country would let a secret agreement entered into by its Executive take precedence over the powers of the legislature, assumed that the jig was up.It was reasonable that the United States and Great Britain should agree forthe duration of the war to unity of action in using the bomb, which, of course,did not even exist in 1943. After all, British scientists, like Lord Rutherford, had had an important part in laying the groundwork for the splitting of the atom. Thenecessity for secrecy is also apparent. However, since there appears to have been no time limit set for the duration of the agreement, it did constitute, as SenatorHickenlooper pointed out in 1947, an &quot; obnoxious&quot; infringement on oursovereignty.The fascinating history of this episode ought to be the subject for further study by the various committees of great and learned constitutional lawyers whohelped defeat the Bricker and George amendments, which would have broughttreaties and executive agreements under control of Congress in so far as they affectinternal law. The Roosevelt secret agreement with Churchill did set up a vetoover American foreign policy of which the British parties to the agreement were apparently unaware.It isn&apos;t inconceivable that in the light of these new revelations Congress will want to take a new look at &quot; treaty law &quot; and executive agreements, and theproposals by Senators Bricker and George to define and establish a safer relation between such agreements and our internal law.&quot;
