Printed for the Cabinet. June 1954C. (54) 19310th June, 1954CONFIDENTIALCABINET office record copy copy No.CABINETTRANSFER OF THE COCOS ISLANDS TO AUSTRALIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations andthe Secretary of State for the colonies in 1949 the Australian Government expressed a desire to develop the airstripbuilt by the R.A.F. during the war on the Cocos Islands (a small group of coralislands in the Indian Ocean midway between Western Australia and Ceylon seeAppendix A) as a staging point in a civil air service between Australia and SouthAfrica, and also for military use in times of emergency. In view of the expenseinvolved they asked whether the administration of the islands, which are at presentadministered as part of the Colony of Singapore and were recently visited by her Majesty after leaving Australia, could be transferred to them. The Chiefsof Staff, having advised that the reconstruction of the airstrip would be of con-siderable strategic value, the late Government agreed to the Australian requestand the intention to transfer the Islands to Australia was announced by the thenColonial Secretary in the House of Commons on 22nd June, 1951. (A copy ofthis statement and of the answer to a Parliamentary Question on 4th July, 1951,are at Appendix B.) The Australians have now completed the reconstruction ofthe airstrip and the air service between Australia and South Africa is in operation.2. The Islanders, who are of Malay extraction, are British subjects andcitizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies. About 1,600 of them have left for North Borneo, where economic conditions are more favourable, and less than400 remain. The Australian Government have agreed that these will be eligiblefor Australian citizenship, but owing to Australian legislation giving effect to the&quot; white Australia &quot; policy, they must treat the islanders like, for example, thePapuans and cannot give them an absolute right of entry into the mainland ofAustralia. The Australians have, however, given a confidential undertaking thatapplications by the Islanders for entry into Australia will receive the mostsympathetic consideration (see Appendix C); and it has also been agreed thatthe opportunity to enter Singapore (which they now have the right to do) will be preserved for them.3. The Law Officers&apos; opinion is that the proper way to effect the transferof the Islands is by Act of Parliament, any other way being not beyond challengelegally. They did, however, indicate a method of proceeding by Order in Council,involving the use of the Colonial Boundaries Act, 1895, if there were &quot; clear andcogent reasons &quot; for not having an Act (see Appendix D). To avoid the possibilityof embarrassing public discussion about the &quot; white Australia &quot; policy, and thedelay which would ensue if a Bill were to be introduced, every effort has beenmade in consultation with the Australian Government to work out a procedure by Order in Council, but without success. The Australian Government cannot agree to the use of the Colonial Boundaries Act because that would, in effect,extend the mainland of Australia to include these Islands, and thus admit theIslanders to unrestricted entry.   This is politically impossible for them.   The
Australian Government could only agree to an alternative Order in Council pro-cedure, of doubtful legal validity,. and on the condition that we assured themthat a subsequent validating Act would be introduced here if necessary. this seems to us a &quot;most &quot;undesirable proceeding, and we accordingly recommend:-(a) that, subject to further consultation with the Australian Government, ashort enabling Bill should be introduced next Session;(b) that the Australian Government should be asked to reaffirm formally, and allow us to use publicly if need be, their assurances (see paragraph 2)as to the citizenship of the Islanders and their opportunity to enterAustralia.SWINTON.O. L.9th June, 1954.APPENDIX AThe Cocos IslandsThe Cocos, or Keeling, Islands are a group of small coral islands situated in theIndian Ocean about 600 miles South-West of Java Head and almost midwaybetween Ceylon and Perth in Western Australia. Captain John Clunies Ross settled in the islands in 1827 and members of his family have lived in, and to a large extentcontrolled, the islands ever since.2. The islands were declared a British possession in 1857. In 1878 they were placed under the control of Ceylon and in 1886 under that of the Governor of theStraits Settlements. In 1903, by an Order-in-Council under the ColonialBoundaries Act, 1895, the islands were incorporated in the Colony of the straits settlements, the Government of which depended until 1946 upon the Straits Settle-ments Act, 1866. That Act was repealed by the Straits Settlements (Repeal) Act,1946, which made new provision for government of the territories formerlyconstituting the Straits Settlements, including the Cocos Islands. By the SingaporeColony Order-in-Council, 1946, the Cocos Islands are governed and administeredas part of the Colony of Singapore.3. In 1901, Direction Island (to the north of the main group) becamean important relay in the imperial cable communications system and in 1940 a naval Wireless Station was established. During the war the harbourage was usedfor flying boats and in 1945 a 2,500 yard air-strip was constructed for use by heavy bombers of the R.A.F. This air-strip was used by the R.A.F. only until 1946; andin 1948 the South African and Australian Governments were asked whether theyhad any interest in its retention. South Africa replied in the negative but theAustralian Defence Department considered that the air-strip should be retained asit was an important air link in an alternative route between the United Kingdomand Australia and might in time of emergency become of great strategic importance.4. The Chiefs of Staff were of the opinion that development of the airstripto international standards would make the Cocos Islands a potentially valuableAllied base for the operation of aircraft and flying boats in support of a campaign in South-East Asia, as well, as opening up a valuable alternative link in imperial communications. They were not, however, able on strategic grounds alone torecommend the expenditure of United Kingdom funds on the maintenance ordevelopment of the airstrip in peace.&apos;5. On the other hand the Cocos Group were already in the Australia, NewZealand and Malaya region of strategic responsibility for planning purposes and only a relatively minor adjustment of the existing boundary between the Far East,and the Australian naval station was needed to make the defence of the Islandsa direct responsibility of Australia. The Chiefs of Staff had no objection to suchan arrangement from the defence point of view and took the view that, if Australian
APPENDIX BParliamentary Statements on Transfer of Cocos IslandsExtract from the House of Commons Official Report for 22nd June, 1951Cocos Islands (Transfer to A australia)Mr. J. Johnson asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies the presentposition regarding the airstrip on the Cocos Islands; and how far he intends todevelop this airstrip for purposes of civil aviation.Mr. J. Griffiths: The Australian Government recently expressed to the UnitedKingdom Government their wish to develop for civil aviation purposes the airstripwhich was constructed on the Cocos or Keeling Islands for the R.A.F. during thelast war. This small group of islands lies in the Indian Ocean about 1,300 milesfrom Western Australia.In view of the strategic advantages which would accrue to the BritishCommonwealth as a whole from the development of this airstrip a project whichwill involve substantial expenditure by the Australian Government the UnitedKingdom Government, after consultation with the Government of Singapore, with whom responsibility for the administration of the islands at present rests, have accepted an Australian proposal that the islands should be transferred to Australia.In view of their very small area the airstrip itself covers a large part of WestIsland, which is the largest of the group it is, on purely practical grounds, desir-able that whatever Government controls the airstrip should also administer the islands.  The necessary Instruments of transfer will be prepared in due course.The islands, most of whose 1,200 inhabitants are Malays, were leased by theCrown in 1886 to George Clunies Ross and his successors in perpetuity, and thetransfer now proposed will not, of course, impair the title of the leaseholder.During recent years a considerable number of the inhabitants have indicatedtheir wish to leave the islands, which are over-populated. Since 1948 emigrationto North Borneo has been proceeding under arrangements made between theGovernments of Singapore and North Borneo. It is intended that all who wishto emigrate (probably a majority of the inhabitants) should be given theopportunity of doing so before the transfer of the islands is effected. TheAustralian Government have agreed to enact legislation giving Australian citizen-ship, or the option of acquiring it, to those who. elect to remain on the islands afterthe transfer.development of the base was contingent on transfer of administrative responsibilityfor the islands, that was desirable provided that the control and operation of theNaval Wireless Station remained undisturbed. After certain undertakings hadbeen given by the Australian Government Her Majesty&apos;s Government agreed totransfer the islands to Australia, and this agreement was announced in the Houseof Commons on 22nd June, 1951.6. In 1886 a freehold lease of the whole of the Islands in perpetuity was granted to George Clunies Ross and his successors, with the provision that theCrown could resume possession for any public purpose. The present proprietorof the estate is Mr. John Clunies Ross, and he still maintains to some extent these -feudal relationship with his employees which is traditional in the CocosIslands.7. The economy of the islands is based on copra. By the end of the warthey had become heavily over-populated and voluntary emigration to North Borneowas arranged in agreement with Mr. Clunies Ross. Some 1,600 people left the islands for Borneo, and by 1952 the native population was reduced to 406 Malay-russians, 18 Chinese and 3 Indians or Pakistanis. There were also over 100 Europeans(including Royal Australian Air Force personnel) engaged in the construction ofthe airport.
Extract from the House of Commons Official Report for 4th July, 1951Cocos Islands (Transfer)Mr. Gammans asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies what steps werebeing taken to seek the views of the inhabitants of the Cocos Islands before it wasdecided to transfer their administration to Australia; and why this matter was notreferred to the Legislative Council of Singapore, under whose jurisdiction the islands have been up to now.Mr. Dugdale: As my right hon. Friend indicated in his reply to my hon.Friend the Member for Rugby (Mr. J. Johnson) on 22nd June, the majority of theislanders have indicated during recent years their wish to emigrate to North Borneo,and emigration has been proceeding. It is the intention that all who wish toemigrate should have the opportunity of doing so before the islands are transferred,and we and the Australian Government have agreed that arrangements should bemade to this end.In these circumstances, the islanders were not consulted beforehand about theproposed transfer. The Governor of Singapore consulted the unofficial membersof the Legislative Council who agreed unanimously with the proposal and suggestedcertain conditions regarding the future status of the remaining islanders, whichthe Australian Government have readily accepted.APPENDIX CRight of Entry of Cocos Islanders into Singapore and australia in January, 1951, the then Governor of Singapore (Sir F. Gimson) reportedthat the transfer of the Cocos Islands to Australia had been discussed with the unofficial members of Legislative Council, who agreed that there would be noobjection to the transfer subject to certain conditions. One of these was that&quot; satisfactory arrangements should be made as to the status of the residents ofthe Islands still left on the Islands at the time of handing over.&quot; It was explainedthat the unofficial members &quot; were concerned lest persons born in the Islandsshould lose their present status and not obtain full citizenship status of Australia.&quot;2. In February, 1951, the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Australiawas asked to inform the Australian Government that the United Kingdom Govern-ment agreed to the transfer subject to certain conditions, one of which was that &quot; Satisfactory arrangements should be made as to the status, in particularcitizenship, of the inhabitants of the Islands. It would meet what we have in mind if, as we assume, residents of the Islands at the time of handing overwould become Australian citizens or at least be given the option of sobecoming, and persons born on the Islands after that date would be Australiancitizens.&apos;3. In May the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Australia reportedthat the Australian Government had stated that the conditions for the transferwere acceptable to them. The Australian Government assumed that the stipulationof the United Kingdom Government about the status of the Islanders would bemet if Australian citizenship, or the option of acquiring it, were granted only tothose members of the population who intended to remain residents of the islands and not to those who, though still resident there at the time of the transfer of administrative control, proposed to transfer to North Borneo.4. In a telegram dated 2nd June, 1951, to the United Kingdom HighCommissioner in Australia the United Kingdom Government confirmed that the
stipulation in question would be met by this proposal of the Australian Govern-ment. Meanwhile the draft of a Statement to be made in Parliament had beenprepared, which included the following passage:  &quot;The Australian Government have agreed to enact legislation givingAustralian citizenship, or the option of acquiring it to those who elect toremain on the Islands after the transfer.&quot;It was ascertained that this draft statement was acceptable to the Governor of singapore and the Australian Government.: 5. Unfortunately the-fact that the undertaking given by the australian government would not entail the right of free.entry to the mainland of australia for Cocos Islanders who became Australian citizens was not appreciated by theGovernment of Singapore, or by the Unofficial Members of the Legislative Council,until Mr. Casey discussed the matter with the Governor in July, 1951. TheGovernor reported in August that if it became known in Singapore strong resent-ment would be expressed in the Press and elsewhere, and he suggested that thepoint should be cleared up before the transfer of the Islands to Australia.6. This led to protracted discussions between the Government of Singapore,Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the Australian Government which centred mainly on the right of the Cocos Islanders to free entry (a) to Singapore and (b) to the mainland of Australia. The first point was ultimately resolved in discussion between the Governor of Singapore and the Unofficial Members of his ExecutiveCouncil by an agreement that the Governor could use his discretionary powers under existing Singapore legislation to admit any of the Islanders who wished tocome to Singapore.7. The second point presented greater difficulty. It was fully discussed between Mr. Casey and the Unofficial Members of the Legislative Council in singapore in April, 1952; and on 20th May, 1952, Mr. Casey wrote to the governor of Singapore (now Sir J. Nicoll) suggesting that a public statement might be madein the following terms:  &quot;Cocos Islanders resident in the Islands at the time.of transfer toAustralia will be entitled, if they so desire, to acquire Australian citizenship.Cocos Islanders who become Australian citizens will in practice be allowed toenter Australia for temporary visits. Although no undertaking can be given that they will be allowed to settle permanently in Australia, and each indi-vidual case will have to be considered on its merits in the light of circumstances,it has rarely been necessary to refuse such permission to an Australian citizen.&quot;8. The Governor of Singapore discussed the position with all the membersof the Singapore Legislative Council, and it was decided to ask for an assuranceby the Australian Government, which would not be for publication, thai any application from the Islanders to enter Australia would be sympatheticallyconsidered. It was on the understanding that such an assurance would be given that the Unofficial Members agreed that the right of entry into Singapore shouldbe preserved by administrative action instead of by legislation (which would involvepublicity). In reply to this request the following assurance was given by Mr. Caseyin July:  &quot; With regard to entry of Islanders into Australia, would you pleaseconvey to the Unofficial Members of Singapore Legislative Council concernedour assurance that applications from Cocos Islanders, after transfer, to enterAustralia will receive the most sympathetic consideration. As you indicatedin your letter, such an assurance would not be for publication. Schoolchildren are, of course, freely admitted subject to the usual requirements ofhealth, finance, accommodation, and enrolment in a school.&quot;This assurance was acceptable to.the Unofficial Members of Council.9. The whole of these negotiations were conducted on the understandingthat the transfer could be effected in a way which would avoid this issue being given prominence. &apos;     &apos;
APPENDIX DOpinion of the Law Officers on the Constitutional Processes Required forthe Transfer of the Cocos IslandsWe are of the opinion that, as a result of Section 1 of the Straits Settlements(Repeal) Act, 1946 (hereinafter called &quot;The Act of 1946&quot;), the proper way of transferring the government of the territories named in the Schedule to that Actis by an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament. We think, therefore, that anyother method is prima facie open to objection and should be resorted to only ifthere are clear and cogent reasons for not effecting the transfer by Act ofParliament.If, however, there are such reasons, the transfer can, in our opinion, be effected by an Order, or Orders, in Council. It is, we think, unlikely that an Order, orOrders, containing the following three provisions could in practice be successfullychallenged in our courts:  (i) A provision, under Section 1 of the Act of 1946, that the Islands shall be governed singly;(ii) A provision, under Section 2 of the Act of 1946, delegating Her Majesty&apos;spowers under the British Settlements Act 1887 and 1945 to the authority which the Australian Government proposed to appoint to govern the islands; and(iii) A provision which could in our view be made by the exercise of the prerogative extending the boundaries of the Commonwealth to includethe Islands.The first two provisions would, in our opinion, have the result of separating ^the Islands from the Colony of Singapore and of giving Politically^ in ouryeauao^^    ^to the^etjof the Australian authority.   They would not, however, suffice to bring *f*M*^into operation Section 122 of the Commonwealth Constitution.The third provision (which would, of course, require the consent of theAustralian Government) would, as a result of the Colonial Boundaries Act, 1895(as amended by Section 8 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act,1900), have the effect that the Islands would be &quot; otherwise acquired &quot; within themeaning of Section 122 of the Constitution, and accordingly that any legislation of the Commonwealth Parliament in pursuance of that Section would be effective in English law.If it is nevertheless decided to effect the transfer by Act of Parliament itwould, in our opinion, be sufficient for the Act to empower Her Majesty to make an Order in Council placing the Islands under the authority of the Commonwealth;but, in our view, it would be necessary for the&apos;Act to recite the request and consentof the Parliament and Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, inaccordance with Sections 4 and 9 (3) of the Statute of Westminster, 1931.
