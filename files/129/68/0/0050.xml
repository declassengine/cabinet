REORGANISATION OF THE COLONIAL service. The term &quot;Her Majesty&apos;s Colonial Service&quot; has been in use for well over a century to describe the members of the public services of the Colonies,Protectorates and other territories which are dependent upon Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom. Originally, the Colonial Service con-sisted of officers appointed from Britain or recruited locally from amongstBritish colonists. As time went on, staffs were increasingly built up fromthe indigenous or resident populations of the territories, but it has alwaysbeen and still is necessary to recruit large numbers of men and women from britain and other Commonwealth countries to supply needs which couldnot be met from local resources, especially in the professional, technical and higher administrative branches.2. Since 1930, these latter branches have been organised as &quot; unified&quot;Services. Although the members of these Services are directly employed and paid by the territorial governments, they are under the general direction and patronage of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. They have, rightly,regarded themselves and have been regarded as belonging to a general service under the Crown as well as to the local civil services of the territories in which they are immediately serving.3. The political developments now taking place or likely to take placein many of the territories, in pursuance of the declared policy of Her majesty&apos;s government in Che United Kingdom to further ther advance towards self-government, make it necessary to review the situation of the Colonial Service.Constitutionally, all officers of the Colonial Service, using this term in the widest sense, are in the same position. They are servants of the Crown, andthe conditions of ther employment are embodied in the Colonial Regulations.These Regulations constitute the Secretary of State as the ultimate authorityfor appointments, discipline, promotions and general conditions of employ-ment. The members of the Service and more especially those who havebeen recruited for the unified Ibranches by successive Secretaries of State are now asking, and are entitled to ask, what will be their position if andWhen as a result of constitutional changes, Her Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom are no longer able to exercise effective control over theirtenure and conditions of employment as hitherto.4. The debt which the oversea territories owe to the loyal, devoted and efficient work of the men and women in the Colonial Service is inestimable.Their work is far from over. The task of building up fully equipped localpublic services is progressing fast; it is an evolutionary process which willbe completed at different times in different places. But side by side there is going on the evolution of the Colonies and other territories themselves,and while their economies and activities continue to expand a wide field of opportunity and need for the skilled assistance of British staff remains.This fact is fully recognised by responsible leaders in the territories.5. It is then of the first importance to these countries, and not least tothose where a new burden of responsibility is being undertaken by theirown governments, that their progress should not be set back by the premature-ture loss of experienced staff or toy failure to attract new staff which theymay require. There :s a problem here which cannot be solved by theterritorial governments alone or by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom alone.   Both sides must act in partnership.
IJ6. Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom recognise that theyhave a special obligation towards those officers of the Colonial Service whohold their present posts as a result of having been selected for them by theSecretary of State. So long as Her Majesty&apos;s Government retains responsi-bility for the Government of the territory in which they are serving thenecessary safeguards are provided by the Colonial Regulations or the consti-tutional instruments. Should the territory in whose public service they areemployed attain self-government, these officers are entitled to expect that thefollowing conditions will be observed : (1) So long as they remain in their existing employment, the Governmentof the territory concerned shall not alter their terms of service so as to make them less favourable than those on which the officers are already serving.(2) The pensions and other benefits for which they or their dependentsmay be qualified under existing laws and regulations shall be similarly safeguarded.(3) They shall continue to be regarded by Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom as members of Her Majesty&apos;s Service andas such to be eligible for consideration for transfer or promotionito any posts which the Secretary of State may be requested to rillin other territories.(4) The government by which they are employed will not unreasonablywithhold consent to their accepting any such transfer or promotionand will preserve their existing pension rights on transfer.(5) They will be given adequate notice of any intention to terminatetheir employment in consequence of constitutional changes and her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom will endeavourto find them alternative employment should they so desire.(6) In the event of premature retirement resulting from constitutional changes they will receive compensation from the government of theterritory concerned.7. Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom accordingly makeknown their intention, if and when a territory attains self-government, toensure the observance of these conditions by securing their embodiment ina formal agreement, to be entered into between Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom and the government of the territory. The agreement will also provide for the continuing payment of pensions already awarded toofficers and their dependants. :,.8. In order that from now on all concerned may be clearly aware of their rights and obligations, a list will be compiled of all officers now inthe Colonial Service to whom Her Majes:y&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom regard the arrangements outlined in the last two paragraphs as applying. The officers included in this list will be given a new corporate title and will be known as Her Majesty&apos;s Oversea Civil Service. Regulationsconstituting this Service and defining the conditions of eligibility for admis-sion to it, are appended to this statement.9. When the new Service is in being, the question whether any particularvacancy, in the filling of which the co-operation of Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment is invited, should be filled by a Member of Her Majesty&apos;s OverseaCivil Service or on the basis of appointment to a purely local service, willbe a matter for arrangement between Her Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom and the territorial government concerned. Any offer of appointment made by or on behalf of the Secretary of State will includeI&apos;7
a dear statement whether it carries with it Membership of Her Majesty&apos;sOversea Civil Service or whether the officers contractual relationship willbe solely with the territorial government. Officers in either category will, ofcourse, be expected to regard themselves as being in all respects responsible to the territorial governments under which they are serving.10. Her Majesty&apos;s Government hope that this evidence of their real con-cern for the present officers of the Colonial Service and of their determination to safeguard the interests of those officers will allay the doubts and anxietieswhich are now apparent in some quarters.11. Her Majesty&apos;s Government also hope that the establishment of this new form of Service will ensure that qualified men and women may be attracted to come forward in future as in the past, in a spirit of confidence,enthusiasm and partnership, to help the oversea governments and peoplesalong the path of sooial, economic and political progress.12. Her Majesty&apos;s Government recognise that there are certain other cate-gories of overseas pensionable officers who have been appointed to theservice of territorial governments otherwise than by selection by the Secre-tary of State. These officers may be assured that their interests will notbe overlooked when the agreements referred to in paragraph 7 are being negotiated.13. Her Majesty&apos;s Government are aware that various proposals have beenput forward for constituting a Commonwealth Service or an Oversea Servicedirectly employed by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.The decisions embodied in the present statement are not intended to excludedevelopment along some suoh lines should this be found to be desirable and practicable. But this is a question which needs and will receive very careful examination in the light of changing conditions. It involves complicatedadministrative and constitutional, as well as financial, problems, and her majesty*s Government feel that they are not yet ready to reach any con-elusions upon them.
