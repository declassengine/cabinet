Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1954CABINET OFFICE Copy No.    ?RECORD COPYCABINETUNITED NATIONS DISARMAMENT COMMISSION SUB-committee memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in its resolution of 28th November, 1953, the General Assembly requested the Disarmament Commission to consider setting up a sub-committee of &quot; thePowers principally involved &quot; which should seek in private an acceptable solutionof the disarmament problem and report to the Commission as soon as possible,in order that the latter in its turn might report to the General Assembly and theSecurity Council not later than 1st September, 1954. At Berlin the four foreign ministers agreed that their Governments should exchange views in accordancewith the Assembly resolution, i.e., in the sub-committee.2. The Disarmament Commission was reconvened on 9th April at the requestof the United Kingdom representative, supported by his United States and Frenchcolleagues, and at its third meeting on 19th April, once again on United Kingdominitiative, the Commission set up the sub-committee mentioned above. The sub-committee is to meet in London on or about 13th May. It is composed of theSoviet Union, United States, United Kingdom, France and Canada, the Ministerof State being the United Kingdom representative. The Disarmament Commissionrejected a Soviet proposal that the sub-committee should comprise also repre-sentatives of India, Czechoslovakia and Communist China, but M. Vyshinsky hasreserved the right to revert to this question later.3. The sub-committee is to report to the Disarmament Commission by15th July.Western Policy in the Disarmament Sub-Committee^ 4. Preliminary discussions are to be held in London with United States,French and Canadian representatives on 10th and 11th May. We have proposedto those three Governments that Western policy should take the following lines.5. The Western Powers should take as their basic position the proposition that the prohibition of all atomic and hydrogen weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction is, and always has been, acceptable to them on two conditions:  (i) that the prohibition of the use, manufacture and possession of atomic andother similar weapons is accompanied by simultaneous and majorreductions in conventional weapons and armed forces to agreed levels,and carried out to an agreed time-table;(ii) that there must be agreement about the setting up of machinery for supervising and enforcing the prohibition and reductions. Enforce-ment measures must not be subject to a veto.6. The object of the Western Powers would be to direct discussion towardsconsideration of the two conditions outlined above, where we should be on safeground. In the course of such discussions it should be possible to obtain clarifica-tion of the Soviet Government^ attitude towards the basic principles of disarmament which the United Nations have laid down in the past as necessaryto any acceptable disarmament programme, and to show that the Soviet Union,not the Western Powers, are responsible for the lack of progress over disarmament.46137CONFIDENTIALC. (54) 1617 th May, 1954
7. The kind of questions to which we should hope to secure an answerwould be:(i) Whether there is agreement that disarmament should cover bothconventional and novel types of weapons.(ii) Whether it is agreed that there should be agreed measures of disclosureand verification of existing levels of armaments and armed forces on which the reductions can be based.(iii) Whether it is agreed that the object of disarmament should be not onlyto abolish the more obnoxious forms of warfare but to remove the disparity between the armaments and armed forces of the major worldPowers by means of a programme of balanced reductions.(iv) Whether there is agreement that States must be prepared to give facilities to the Control Organ sufficient to enable it to guarantee that evasionsshall be detected, even if this entails some derogation from the normalconcept of State sovereignty.(v) Whether there is any agreement on the enforcement procedure, e.g.,whether a procedure can be devised which avoids the use of the veto.8. The United States authorities have stated that they agree with this policy,but will have some slight modifications and some additions to suggest. The french authorities have also stated that they are in general agreement with our proposals.The Canadians have said that the United Kingdom proposals are broadly accept-able but they have not yet completed their study of them.9. I think that my colleagues will wish to know the line which I have authorised the Minister of State to follow in the preliminary discussions with our allies and subsequently in the sub-committee&apos;s meetings.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,6th May, 1954.
