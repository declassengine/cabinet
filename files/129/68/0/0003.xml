Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1954SECRETCABINET office record copy copy No.C. (54) 15323rd April, 1954CABINETMEMBERS&apos; SALARIESNote by the Prime minister circulate for the information of my colleagues a letter addressed to me by a Conservative Member of Parliament.10 Downing Street, S.W.1,23rd April, 1954.Right Hon. Sir Winston Churchill,C.H., O.M., M.P.,10 Downing Street, S.W. 1.I venture to write to you about M.P.s&apos; expenses in order to put three points which were not mentioned at last night&apos;s meeting of the 1922 Committee.Having been very close to this controversy since it began I have been in afavourable position to assess public opinion and I am certain that whilst thereis general opposition to an increase in Members&apos; salaries there is also a very strong feeling that it is unjust to expect Members to pay away such a high proportion of their present salary in expenses. The general view is that, as a salary,  1,000 p.a. is adequate but that the State should bear our legitimateexpenses.W. S. C.My dear Prime Minister,House of Commons,9th April, 1954.
Secondly, may I point out that the suggested subsistence allowance is opento one very serious objection. It would go to all who qualify for it howeverwealthy some of them may be and it would be denied to those who fail to qualify,however needy some of them might be.To make my third and last point I must appear to grind a personal axe.I hope you will forgive me. &amp;I am the son of a builder&apos;s labourer who bequeathed to me nothing more thanthe ability to take hard knocks a legacy which jydo-jiot urieer-value.More by hard work than any other merit I have met with a certain degreeof success and when I first entered the House just over four years ago I was thehead of my own small, but prosperous business. My income was between 3,000 and  3,500 p.a.Since then, as a direct result of the fact that my duties as an M.P. have forcedme to neglect my business, my income has steadily declined. During the year ending March 31st, 1954, for which I have just seen the figures, my income hasbeen &quot; NIL.&quot;I will not burden you with a list of the unpleasant but inevitable consequences.I realise that what happens to me as an individual is of no importance to theConservative Party. But I submit that what happens to me as representing atype is of the utmost importance, both to the Party and to the Country.I am convinced that the future of the nation depends upon the continuancein power of a Conservative Government; I am equally certain that the Conserva-tives cannot remain in power without men like me to hold seats like mine.Nothing the Government now decides to do about this issue will be in timeto save me. I must abandon all political ambitions and get back to the job of earning my living and supporting my family. But please don&apos;t let this happen toall of us. I pray that you will do what you can to make it possible for some of usto continue to serve our country through our Party.Should this letter bear the fruit I hope it will, I shall then have served someuseful purpose if only that of an unfortunate example to be avoided in the future.Yours respectfully,(Signed)
