Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1954SECRET cabinet office Copy No.record copy . (54) 19410th June, 1954CABINETUNREST ON THE RAILWAYSNote by the Minister of Labour and National service at the Prime Minister^ suggestion, I am circulating for the information of mycolleagues the text of the minute, which I addressed to the Prime Minister on 4th June, on &quot; Unrest on the Railways.&quot;W. M.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,9th June, 1954.Prime MinisterUNREST ON THE RAILWAYSThe end of the unofficial strike of locomotive drivers and firemen about lodgingturns marks only the deferment of trouble between the British Transport Corn-mission and their employees. I had yesterday a talk with the Minister of transport and the Chairman of the British Transport Commission.Some of the men who went on strike in the Western Region, although nowback at work, are on record as prepared to strike again unless all lodging turnsare withdrawn, but no time limit is stated. The immediate difficulties have shiftedfrom the Western Region to the Eastern and North-Eastern Regions. Furtherlodging turns agreed between the British Transport Commission and the unions are due to be introduced in the Eastern Region on the 14th June. The british transport Commission has no intention of withdrawing any lodging turns, andthose due to come into force in the Eastern Region on 14th June will be insistedupon. There is a meeting on 10th June at York of men in the Eastern and North-Eastern Regions (although in fact no new turns are for the time being proposed forthe North-Eastern Region). It is not possible to forecast what attitude will betaken, but it is quite likely that new difficulties will arise in the middle of the month.The matter is complicated by the fact that the union principally concerned the associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen has now adopted thepolicy of trying to get rid of all lodging turns. Accordingly, there is a risk of anystoppage being official, though it is doubtful whether the National Union of railwaymen would support it.I think it difficult to resist the conclusion that some of the trouble which hasoccurred about lodging turns has been due to a failure on the part of the unions to keep in sufficiently close touch with the branches and to bring- the questions and decisions fully and promptly down to the men concerned. So far as I can judge the British Transport Commission are not to blame for this, for they have allowed ample time for the men to be fully consulted through their unions before putting the agreed lodging turns into effect.46258
The Chairman of the British Transport Commission, however, thinks that the trouble is more deep-seated. I think myself this must be so, because the opinionof footplate men in the different Regions about lodging turns is sharply divided.General Robertson said that he was told by some of the men that if all lodgingturns were abolished there would be a strike about this. The reason is that insome Regions these turns are popular because of the increased pay. One reasonfor the opposition to lodging turns is the fear that they will result in redundancy.General Robertson thinks there are too many men for the work, but this will bedealt with by normal wastage and not by dismissals. He thinks that the realtrouble is that the spirit of the men is wrong at the present moment, and he thinks that difficulties over wages largely account for this. Before the war railwaymen,relatively to other workers, were in a secure and adequately paid employment.Now, compared with for instance miners or steel workers, they are underpaid.The three railway unions are sharply divided about the wages structure. general robertson is satisfied that some of the lower paid workers ought to get more,and that men in the A.S.L.E.F. engine drivers in particular ought to receive ahigher differential. He intends to push on as quickly as possible with negotiationsabout wages and thus to give the men the feeling that their fundamental grievancesare being promptly dealt with. Both the Minister of Transport and I agree thathe is right in this policy, but we fear that we must have considerable anxietiesabout industrial unrest in the railways in the weeks and months immediately ahead of us.1 do not think that there is any action which the Government couldimmediately take, but as trouble might arise during the Recess I thought it wise to let you have this memorandum. It represents the views of the Minister ofTransport as well as my own.WALTER MONCKTON.4th June, 1954.
