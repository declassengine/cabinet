75&quot;(this document is the property of her britannic majesty^ government)confidential / /- cabinet office (Lc.(54) 174 r   co r d co p&apos; copy no.24th. May, 1954cabinetUNITED KINGDOM ASSOCIATION WITH THEEUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL community memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIn the discussions in the Ministerial Committee I havedissented from the recommendation that, when we see M. Monnet forexploratory talks next month, we should propose to exclude from thescope of the initial negotiations the question of reducing our tariff on imported steel and that we should let this question stand over to bedealt with, along with other matters such as investment and price policy,in the proposed Council of Association between us.    Nor do I consider itwise to agree to enter into Association before certain important points ofprinciple have been negotiated with the High Authority.     I think it may be helpful to my colleagues if I explain briefly the principal reasons for mydissent and the broad lines on which I think we should handle thesematters.2.        Of course it is not necessary for us to go to the length of abandoning all protection for our industry or of making substantial con-cessions unilaterally.    To abandon our traditional policy of protection for the steel industry would obviously be a very serious step for us totake, and M. Monnet himself does not suggest this as an essential condition of association.    But I am convinced that it is not practical to hope for any enduring collaboration between our steel industry and the steel industry of Western Europe unless we are prepared to negotiate areduction of the high tariff (about 25 per cent) that we have againstEuropean steel to something like the moderate level (on average about12 per cent) of the European tariffs against our steel.    So long as we have this artificial obstruction to divide us it is simply not to be expected thatthere could be a healthy, enduring and effective relationship between us insuch matters as prices, investment, third markets or any of the other issues which would make up the day-to-day business of a Council of association.3.        Secondly, I am sure,too,that it would be a tactical mistake toestablish the Council of Association before the tariff issue had been settled.    Our strongest bargaining card vis-a-vis the High Authority is their desire to get us into an association with them, and if we gave thisaway in advance we should be in a weak bargaining position in any subsequent negotiations.    Moreover, if we entered into an association withthe major issues unresolved, our representatives would besexposed topersistent &quot;nagging&quot; on these matters &quot;(we have had experience of this inthe Organisation for European Economic Co-operation) and the cumulative effect might well be to worsen, rather than to improve, our relationswith the Schuman countries.1-
7&amp;4.        For these reasons I think that the Official Working Party was quite right to put to Ministers the various ways in which we mightnegotiate on the steel tariff and the associated problems of safeguardingour industry from Continental dumping.     1 think that we should now make up our minds on the form of tariff reduction which would be most accept-able to us and the form of safeguard which would seem likeliest to serveour purpose.    The time for actual negotiations on this will be, not when we see M. Monnet next month, but at a subsequent meeting for which weshould arrange when we see M. Monnet.    But we must make up our ownminds, before we see M. Monnet and plan for further talks ornegotiations with him, how we are going to play our hand on this tariffquestion which, as I have said, is in my judgment integral to any agree-ment to provide for institutional co-operation between us.5.        To sum up, I recommend my colleagues to agree that we should now proceed as follows:-(1)  When we see M. Monnet we should arrange with him the basis on which talks should take place inrespect of(a) a reduction in the steel tariff onmutually advantageous terms;(b) the form of Association with theHigh Authority;(2) if these arrangements are acceptable, we should then open negotiations on the tariff;(3)  on the completion of these negotiations, and notsooner, we should establish a formal aseociationwith the High Authority.P.T.Board of Trade, S.W.1.24th May, 1954.
