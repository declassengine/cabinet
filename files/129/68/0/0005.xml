(54) 155 RECORD COPY27th April, 1954CABINETINDOCHINANote by the Secretary of the CabinetI circulate, for the information of the Cabinet, a record of two emergencymeetings of Ministers which were held at 10, Downing Street, on Sunday,25th April, 1954, to consider an American proposal for Anglo-American military intervention in Indo-China.The Prime Minister presided over both these meetings. At the first, at 11 a.m.,the following attended: Foreign Secretary, Home Secretary, Minister of Defence,Colonial Secretary, Secretary of State for War, Secretary of State for Air, Ministerof State, First Sea Lord, Chief of the Imperial General Staff and Chief of the AirStaff.The second meeting, at 4 p.m., was attended by: Foreign Secretary, Ministerof Defence, Colonial Secretary, Minister of Housing, Minister of State, First sea lord and Chief of the Imperial General Staff.(Signed) NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,27th April, 1954.RECORD OF FIRST MEETINGThe Foreign Secretary said that, while he had been in Paris for the meeting ofthe North Atlantic Council, the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Dulles, hadinitiated a number of conversations about the military situation in Indo-China.He had reported the gist of the conversations in Paris telegrams No. 257, No. 262and No. 267; but the proposals which Mr. Dulles was putting forward were ofsuch importance that he had thought it right to return to London for personalconsultations before going on to the Geneva Conference. He had discussed theposition with the Prime Minister immediately on his return, and they had both feltthat such of their colleagues as were immediately available should be brought together at this emergency meeting so that they might have an opportunity of expressing their views before the Foreign Secretary went to Geneva.The Foreign Secretary said that the military situation in Indo-China was extremely grave. It now seemed inevitable that the French garrison at Dien BienPhu would be overwhelmed, or compelled to surrender. Mr. Dulles evidentlyfeared that this would be promptly followed by the collapse of all French resistancethroughout Indo-China; and, in order to avert this, he favoured some dramaticgesture of Anglo-American intervention in Indo-China.   He had originally been46087 .   -&apos;   ;   .   -; r
thinking in terms of action by United States air forces for the relief of Dien BienPhu;. but he had now been persuaded that this could not in fact save the garrisonthere. Though he still favoured early air action he now envisaged it as a meansof rallying French and Viet Namese morale elsewhere in Indo-China with a viewto preventing a general collapse. Military intervention in Indo-China could not beauthorised by the United States Administration without the approval of Congress;and Mr. Dulles believed that Congress would be more likely to accord this approvalif the intervention were undertaken on a joint-Anglo-American basis. His specificproposal was, therefore, that the United States and United Kingdom governments should jointly give an assurance to the French that they would join in the defenceof Indo-China against Communist aggression; and that, as an earnest of their intention to carry out this assurance, there should be some immediate military assistance, including participation by token British forces.Mr. Dulles believed that an Anglo-American initiative of this kind would havea powerful moral effect in rallying the anti-Communist forces in Indo-China. he also seemed to believe that military intervention by air forces alone could make an effective contribution towards retrieving the local military situation. The foreign secretary said that he could not share either of these beliefs, and had done his best to make this plain in his conversations with Mr. Dulles. He was doubtfulwhether such intervention would have any substantial effect in rallying publicopinion in Indo-China. He was certain that it would not be welcomed bynationalist opinion in South-East Asia generally. As for the military results, the limited measures which the Americans were contemplating would not, in hisopinion, achieve any substantial results. Admiral Radford, the Chairman of theUnited States Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was with Mr. Dulles in Paris, was thinkingsolely in terms of attack by land-based or carrier-borne aircraft. This would haveto be limited in the main to attacks on the supply columns and lines of communi-cation of the Viet-minh troops, and was not likely to have any appreciable effecton their efficiency. Admiral Radford had not contemplated the possibility of sending ground forces into Indo-China. In fact, however, the &quot; war &quot; in Indo-china was a widespread insurrection, comparable to the situation with which we had originally been confronted in Malaya; and no military aid to the French could be fully effective unless it included the provision of ground troops.The Foreign Secretary said that the French had at first showed little enthusiasmfor Mr. Dulles&apos; proposals. In particular, they had not asked us for any militaryhelp though they had said that they would be grateful for any that we might feel able to provide. This had strengthened his view that the Americans shouldbe discouraged from taking precipitate action on the lines envisaged by Mr. Dulles;and he had done his best to point out the dangers of this course and the limitedadvantage which it seemed likely to bring to the French. Finally, he had indicated that it was most unlikely that the United Kingdom Government would feel ableto associate themselves with such an American initiative, and that he wouldcertainly need to consult his colleagues in London before he could express any final view on Mr. Dulles&apos; proposal.The Foreign Secretary said that, after reflecting further on the matter anddiscussing it with the Prime Minister, his recommendation to his colleagues was thatthey should decline to give any immediate undertaking to afford military assistanceto the French in Indo-China. It now seemed inevitable that large parts of Indo-China should fall under Communist control, and the best hope of a lasting solutionlay in some form of partition. Our object should therefore be to strengthen the negotiating position of the French at the Geneva Conference. Their position wouldnot be strengthened by a premature military intervention which would soon beseen to have been ineffective. On the contrary, he thought that France&apos;s Alliescould at the moment make a better impression on the Chinese if they left them toguess what action they might subsequently take to help the French in Indo-China. He therefore suggested that, in his further discussions on this subject atGeneva, he should be guided by the following principles which he submitted forthe approval of his colleagues:-^&quot; 1. We do not regard the London communique as committing us tojoin in immediate discussions on the possibility of Allied intervention in theIndo-China war.&quot; 2. We are not prepared to give any undertakings now, in advance ofGeneva, concerning United Kingdom military action in Indo-China.&quot; 3. But we shall give all possible diplomatic support to the french delegation at Geneva in efforts to reach an honourable settlement.
&quot; 4. We can give an assurance now that if a settlement is reached atGeneva we shall join in guaranteeing that settlement and in setting up a collective defence in South-East Asia, as foreshadowed in the London com-munique, to make that joint guarantee effective.&quot; 5. We hope that any Geneva settlement will make it possible for thejoint guarantee to apply to at least the greater part of Indo-China.&quot; 6. If no such settlement is reached we shall be prepared at that timeto consider with our Allies the action to be taken jointly in the situation then existing.&quot; 7. But we cannot give any assurance now about possible action onthe part of the United Kingdom in the event of failure to reach agreement atGeneva for a cessation of hostilities in Indo-China.&quot; 8. We shall be ready to join with the United States Government nowin studying measures to ensure the defence of Siam and the rest of South-east asia including Malaya in the event of all or part of Indo-China being lost.&quot;In discussion the following points were made:  (a) French morale was undoubtedly at a low ebb. If the garrison atDien Bien Phu were overwhelmed or compelled to surrender, it was very likely that the French Government would fall. It might be succeeded by a neutralistGovernment. And, if after the fall of Dien Bien Phu the French abandoned thestruggle in Indo-China, their position in Africa might well be undermined andtheir prestige as a world Power would be seriously impaired.(b) These considerations should not, however, lead us into an unjustifiablemilitary adventure in Indo-China. If we could have assisted in rescuing Europeansfrom Dien Bien Phu, this would have been an operation which could have been justified to British public opinion. This, however, was not a feasible operation.Indeed, the consensus of military opinion was that the fall of Dien Bien Phu couldnot be prevented by any Anglo-American air attack which could be mountedwithin the next few days. The Chiefs of Staff agreed that air operations could not now have any appreciable effect on the outcome of the battle for Dien Bien Phu.(c) A general assurance of Anglo-American military assistance in the defenceof Indo-China was bound to lead to our committing ground forces in this theatre.And, in view of the history of the campaign, it seemed likely that very substantialforces might be required over a long period. The Chiefs of Staff expressed theview that it was quite unrealistic to suppose that effective assistance could be givento the French in Indo-China by naval and air forces alone. It was recalled that,at the outset of their intervention in Korea, the American military authorities hadsimilarly believed that the South Koreans could be effectively supported by navaland air action alone.(d) It seemed likely that the air action which Admiral Radford had in mindwould not be confined to Indo-China. It was known that Admiral Radford had for some time held the view that Chinese support of Communist insurrections inother countries of Asia should be checked by vigorous military action against theChinese mainland, e.g., blockade of the Chinese coast and air attack on military targets in China. He believed that direct military action could be taken againstChina without drawing the Soviet Union into the conflict. The Foreign secretary said that he rated very much more highly the risks of such a course of military action. He considered that anything like open war with China might well involvethe Soviet Union and lead to a third world war.(e) The Foreign Secretary said that while he was in Paris he had taken theopportunity of discussing Mr. Dulles&apos; proposals with the Canadian and AustralianMinisters for External Affairs. Mr. Pearson fully shared his view that immediatemilitary intervention in Indo-China would be ineffective locally and would be illreceived by world opinion. Mr. Casey was less clear in his views: the spread of communism throughout South-East Asia concerned Australia more nearly thanCanada: but there seemed to be a good prospect that the Australian Governmentwould support the response which we were proposing to make to Mr. Dulles&apos;initiative.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, said that weshould clearly be ill-advised to encourage the Americans to take precipitate military action in Indo-China. The effects of a Communist triumph at Dien Bien Phuwould be grave and far-reaching. It would be greeted throughout Asia as a notable triumph of Communism over capitalism, and of Asians over Europeans.46087 b 2
Within Indo-China opinion among the Viet Namese would at once become moreunsympathetic towards the French, and the local situation would certainly becomemuch more grave. At a later stage serious threats of Communist encroachmentwould develop in Siam and Burma and ultimately in Malaya. But, grave though these consequences were, it did not follow that they could be averted by precipitatemilitary action on the lines envisaged by the Americans. Therefore, he stronglyrecommended that the policy of the United Kingdom Government should be founded on paragraphs 4, 6 and 8 of the draft directive which the Foreign secretary had put before his colleagues.In discussion of this draft directive, the following further points were made:  (/) In the measures for the defence of South-East Asia, which were contem-plated in paragraph 8 of the draft directive, our primary role would be the defenceof Malaya. It should be made clear to the Americans that we could not be expectedto carry this out effectively if we were compelled to dissipate our resources in otherparts of the area, e.g., Siam. It was desirable that the Americans should make themselves responsible for any military assistance which might have to be givento Siam.(g) Communist control of Indo-China would reduce the rice supplies availablefor the free countries of South-East Asia. The Colonial Secretary undertook toput in hand an immediate study of this problem, including the possibility of acquiring some of the surplus supplies of rice which were now available.(h) If Communist encroachment spread from Indo-China to Siam, Burma andIndonesia, it would in the long run become much more difficult for us to maintain our position in Malaya. That situation was not, however, likely to arise for sometime to come.(/) The Americans were, however, disposed to exaggerate the immediate diffi-culties which we should encounter in Malaya. The Colonial Secretary and TheMinister of Defence undertook to supply the Foreign Secretary with up-to-date information on the political and military situation in Malaya, for use in his further discussions at Geneva.(j) If Indo-China passed under Communist control and Siam were threatened,increasing importance would attach to our military plans for sealing off Malayaagainst infiltration from the north. The Foreign Secretary and the Chiefs of staff were authorised to disclose these plans in confidence to the United States authori-ties, in the course of their further conversations on Indo-China, and to enlist their support for them.The Meeting -Agreed that the United Kingdom Government should not associate them-selves with any immediate declaration of intention to afford military assistance to the French in Indo-China; and invited the Foreign Secretary,in his further discussions on this question at Geneva, to be guided by theprinciples embodied in paragraphs 1-8 of the draft directive set out above.
RECORD OF SECOND MEETINGLater in the day, a further meeting was held to review the situation in thelight of a communication which the French Ambassador in London had madeto the Foreign Secretary after the end of the morning meeting.At the morning meeting the Foreign Secretary had referred to a letter which mr. Dulles was thinking of sending to the French Foreign Minister in reply to asuggestion by the French military commander in Indo-China that nothing butan attack by American air forces could save the garrison at Dien Bien Phu.Mr. Dulles had been proposing to reply that, according to his military advice,such air intervention could not at this juncture save the garrison. He had intended,however, to add that there was no military reason why the fall of Dien Bien Phushould materially and vitally alter the military situation in Indo-China; and that,if early action were taken to establish a system of collective defence for South-east asia, the position in Indo-China could be held by the collective action of thefree nations having vital interests in the area. The letter would conclude withan offer of closer and more vigorous combination with France and a call to theFrench to show the resolution and the will required to enable them to overcometheir present difficulties.The Foreign Secretary said that soon after the end of the morning meeting he had learned that this letter had been delivered to the French Foreign Minister:its text was reproduced in Paris telegram No. 274. The French Ambassador inLondon had handed him copies of the letter and of M. bidault&apos;s reply (Paristelegram No. 275). The reply dealt solely with the question of immediate military intervention at Dien Bien Phu. It repeated the view of the French military advisersthat the garrison could still be saved by a massive intervention by american aircraft. In addition, however, M. Massigli had informed the Foreign Secretaryof an oral communication made to the French Ambassador in Washington onbehalf of the United States Government. In this it was suggested that an imme-diate declaration should be made, on behalf of the Governments of the UnitedStates, the United Kingdom, France, the Philippines and the Associated States in indo-China, proclaiming the common will of the signatories to check theexpansion of Communism in South-East Asia and to use &quot; eventual militarymeans &quot; for this purpose. The French Government had been urged to do every-thing in their power to persuade the United Kingdom Government to join in sucha declaration and to co-operate forthwith in Washington in the preparation of adraft of the proposed declaration. They had been informed that, once he was assured that the United Kingdom Government would associate themselves withsuch a declaration, President Eisenhower would be prepared to seek Congressionalapproval for military intervention in Indo-China, and that it was possible that united States naval aircraft might be able to launch an attack by 28th April onthe forces now besieging Dien Bien Phu. M. Massigli had strongly urged thatthe United Kingdom Government should at once indicate their willingness to join in making a declaration on the lines proposed.The Foreign Secretary said that he was disturbed by the tactics followed bythe Americans in making this indirect approach to the United Kingdom Govern-ment through the French. Though a long conversation had been held with theFrench Ambassador in Washington, no corresponding communication had beenmade to Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador there. We were being pressed to join in ageneral declaration of readiness to fight Communism in South-East Asia in orderto support a request to Congress for authority to employ naval air forces of theUnited States in an air strike against the besiegers of Dien Bien Phu. The pro-posal for this air strike was evidently based on Admiral Radford&apos;s conviction that the time was ripe for the Western Powers to show that they were ready totake direct military action to check the ambitions of Communist China in South-East Asia. Admiral Radford had admitted that naval aircraft could not inter -vene effectively in the actual battle at Dien Bien Phu, as the forces on either sidewere now so closely interlocked that direct air attack on the besiegers was nolonger feasible, and he had recognised that the air strike could be made onlvagainst &quot; second-line targets.&quot; It was evident that in this phrase he included, no*tonly supply lines to the beseiging forces, but also airfields in China.The Foreign Secretary said that Ministers had no authority from Parliamentto support such a direct military intervention in Indo-China. Nor would theaction proposed have the approval of the United Nations.   Action on the lines
contemplated by Admiral Radford would mean that United States air forces wouldbecome engaged in direct hostilities with China. If the United States began towage open war against China, there was a grave risk that the Soviet Union would feel obliged to intervene. This action might therefore be the first step towards a third world war.In discussion the Chiefs of Staff confirmed the view that the proposed inter-vention by American naval air forces could not be effective in saving the garrison at Dien Bien Phu.The Prime Minister said that what we were being asked to do was in effect to aid in misleading Congress into approving a military operation which would itself be ineffective and might well bring the world to the verge of a major war.He had no doubt that this request must be rejected. He considered that the foreign secretary should proceed to Geneva, as planned, and should tell Mr. Dulles andM. Bidault that our military advice gave us no confidence that the fortress ofDien Bien Phu could be effectively relieved by air intervention of the kind nowproposed. In any event we ourselves had no air forces which could assist in suchan operation. In his further conversations the Foreign Secretary should be guided by the directive which Ministers had approved at their first meeting earlier in theday.The Meeting Reaffirmed the decision taken at the meeting earlier that day, and authorised the Foreign Secretary to reject the specific request that theUnited Kingdom Government should associate themselves with animmediate declaration of intention to check the expansion of Communismin South-East Asia and to use &quot; eventual military means &quot; for thatpurpose.
