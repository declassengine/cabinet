(THIS DOCUMENT *s THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)---:i........-.......-........-......-.......--------.........-......---.....----secret. (54)1163CABINET office record copy copy NO.18th May, 1954CABINETTRANSFER OF THE HIGH COMMISSION territories memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth relations the South African High Commissioner called on me thismorning and gave rne Dr. Malan&apos;s proposal as set out in paragraph 1of C. (54) 165.     I said that I must consult the Cabinet.    Dr. Geyerasked if I could tell him personally what I thought our reactions wouldbe.     I recalled that in my original letter to Dr. Malan I had said thatany negotiations on transfer at this time must be fruitless.    As,however, Dr. Malan had raised the issue of transfer, the United 2-IingdomGovernment had been compelled to state clearly that they could not contemplate transfer at the present time.     I felt pretty sure that the reaction of the Cabinet would be not only that a visit of a United kingdom minister to South Africa could serve no useful purpose as there was really nothing to negotiate about, but that such a visit would be mis-understood in both countries and would do much more harm than good.2. Dr. Geyer then asked what would be our reaction if insteadof asking a United Kingdom Minister to come to South Africa, Dr. Malansuggested sending a Union Minister here.     I said rny reaction would bemuch the same, if the South African minister&apos;s visit was announced asbeing for the purpose of discussing transfer.    This led me to make thefollowing suggestion.     Why not let the whole question of transfer diedown now?    Later on, say in November, Dr. Malan might send a seniorMinister, accompanied by his Minister of Defence, to talk with theForeign Secretary and other Ministers here about the whole field of world affairs, including defence;  in fact those subjects in which thePrime Minister and I had said in our statements in Parliament that wehad so much common interest.    This would be very natural.     foreign ministers and other senior Ministers from other Commonwealth countries were constantly here for such discussions.    We had had no such talks with South African Ministers since the Coronation.    Such a visit wouldbe natural and helpful.    Dr. Geyer was much attracted by this suggestion.3. I then said to Dr. Geyer that if our answer to Dr. Malan&apos;proposal was what I anticipated, I presumed Dr. Malan would wish tomake that public.     To my surprise Dr. Geyer said, speaking purelypersonally, he was not so sure.    I at once said that it would be anadmirable solution if Dr. Malan could take the line that, while he had felt bound to make his position plain in his Parliament and get itendorsed by their Resolution, and that while the United KingdomGovernment had equally made their position plain, no useful purposecould be served by attempting to carry the matter further at the presenttime.    A Ministerial visit in November would then be all the morenatural and acceptable.1-
4. Dr. Geyer always speaks to me very frankly;  and I know that he was against Dr. Malan raising the transfer issue publicly.I think, therefore, he may be taking too favourable a view of Dr. Malan&apos;sreactions.    But even if Dr. Malan states publicly that he had proposed a visit of a United Kingdom Minister to discuss transfer and that we had declined the invitation, that would not be too bad:  it would, at any rate,bring this tiresome issue to an end for the time being.    It would in no way preclude the visit of Union Ministers towards the end of the year for general talks.     On the contrary, such a visit would show that ourrelations continued close and friendly, and that would be all to the good.5. Dr. Geyer said that he would not report this conversationto his Government except to say that he had carried out his PrimeMIinister&apos;s instructions, and that I had said I must consult the Cabinet.SWINTONCommonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1.13th May, 1954.
