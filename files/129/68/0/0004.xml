(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential. (5HY J\5k27TH APRIL. 195k,COST OF LIVING ALLOWANCE FOR industrial workers IN GIBRALTAR&quot;&quot;&quot; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Memorandum by the Minister of State for colonial AffairsThe unskilled industrial worker in Gibraltar receivesU-O/- a week as basic wage, plus U8/- cost-of-living allowanceif he is a Gibraltarian but only 2k/- if he is a Spaniard.Upwards of 8,000 Spaniards cross the frontier daily to work,2,1+00 are employed by the Service Departments.     The colonial government employs kCO.     The remainder work for theCity Council and private employers.2.     The 51 per cent differential in cost-of-living allowanceswas fixed arbitrarily in 19U5 when the allowance, which wasthen at a much lower rate, was first introduced.     Whenarrangements were made in 19k7 to link the allowances withthe Gibraltar cost-of-living index the 50 per cent differentialwas maintained and was applied to all variations in the allowances.     This procedure was justified on the generalground of the differences believed to exist between livingcosts in Spain and Gibraltar.     These differences, however,were never precisely determined.3.     We have twice in recent years relied on the argument thatliving costs differ in replying to diplomatic protests bythe Spanish Government about the existence of thedifferentials.     The topic has, however, remained in the forefront of Spanish agitation over Gibraltar and continuesto be the subject of representations by the Spanish Consul-General in Gibraltar and by the &quot;Syndicate&quot; which operateswithin Spain as the officially sponsored trade union organisation for Spanish workers in Gibraltar.      (It cannotlegally operate in Gibraltar but in practice it is necessaryto have dealings with it,)k.     The Gibraltar Government has reconsidered the wholequestion and has come to the conclusion that this discrimina-tion between locally engaged Spanish and Gibraltarian workersdoing the same work is indefensible in principle and that,whatever the motives of Spanish agitation, it is important that Gibraltar should put herself in a morally sound positionin relation to her Spanish workers.     In this they have thesupport of the City Council, the majority of private employers and the trade unions within Gibraltar, which consist mainly of Gibraltarians,      In accordance with their normal practice of attempting to maintain a common front amongofficial employers they have therefore sought the agreementof the Service Departments to abolish the differential.CABINET office record COPY copy  N0&apos;CABINET
5.     In March, at the request of the Service Departments, a comparison was made of consumer prices in Gibraltar and spain, based on the articles comprised in the Gibraltar cost-of-living index.     This indicated that the cost-of-living in the adjacent area of Spain was the same as, if not slightly higher than, in Gibraltar,     Even assuming that the Spanishworker always had the best of both worlds by buying everyarticle in the cheaper market, the advantage to the Spaniardwould be no more than \h/- a week;    and this figure ignorescertain factors not susceptible of precise mathematicalanalysis e.g. travelling costs of Spanish workers to andfrom Gibraltar and differences in rent and accommodationstandards which offset any such advantage,6.     In spite of that the Treasury and the Service Departmentsmaintain that a differential is justified and can be defended:that the figures produced do not provide grounds forabolition or even reduction of the differential;    and that the onus of justifying the differential does not rest on theemployers.     The cost of abolition of the differential tothe Service Departments is estimated at about SA 50,000annually,7.     While the need for economy in defence expenditure is fully recognised, I cannot agree with the view&quot;of the treasury and the Service Departments.     On the contrary, it seems tome that we are faced here with valid arguments both of principle and of fact which Her Majesty&apos;s Government,&apos;as a goodemployer, are obliged to consider and which, in our own interests, we should be most unwise to ignore,      I must therefore press that the differential should be abolished.It is clearly desirable that a decision should be taken before the Queen&apos;s visit to Gibraltar on 10th May.(Intld.)
