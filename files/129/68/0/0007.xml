Printed for the Cabinet.  April 1954SECRET CABINET OFFICE Copy No.    g \C. (54) 157 RECORD COPY30th April, 1954CABINETPROVISIONAL LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME: 1954-55 session memorandum by the Lord Privy seal the Future Legislation Committee have examined the proposals of departments for legislation in the 1954-55 Session and have invited me to seek ontheir behalf the Cabinefs approval of a provisional programme based on the annexed lists, in which Bills have been classified as follows:  A. Bills which appear to be essential.B. Bills which will become essential in certain circumstances.C. Bills which should probably be included in the programme.D. Bills to enable emergency powers to be dispensed with.E. Bills from which a few might be selected for inclusion in the programme.F. Bills which might be left for a later session.G.-Scottish Bills.H. Bills suitable for Private Members.Within each list Bills are shown in alphabetical order. Consolidation Bills are not included.Approach to the programme . In formulating proposals for a provisional programme the Committee have borne in mind that the next may well be the last session of the present parliament and that it is, therefore, desirable to frame the programme with a view to affordingsome relaxation of the Parliamentary pressure to which our supporters have been continuously subject since the present Government took office. Furthermore, the session may well be rather shorter than earlier sessions of the present Parliament,not only through the possible absence of a resumption after the 1955 summer recess, but also if the volume of legislation to be completed during the present session should make it necessary to defer the opening of the new session until ratherlater in the autumn than has been customary in recent years. Both these considerations suggest a special need to avoid overloading the programme.Proposed programme. On the assumption that all the Bills in List A and most of those in List Bwill prove unavoidable and that those in List C should be included in the pro-gramme, there is unlikely to be time for more than one of the following majorBills (or groups of Bills) from List E:  Closing Hours of ShopsHealthj Welfare and Safety of Agricultural and forestry WorkersHealth, Welfare and Safety in Non-IndustrialPlaces of EmploymentHealth, Welfare and Safety of Railway WorkersLocal Government Organisation and Finance       (See C. (54) 111 and 120)Road traffic to these should perhaps be added Betting, Gaming and Lotteries which, althoughit may not be of comparable size, would be likely to prove a difficult and con-tentious measure. The Cabinefs choice from among these will help to determine46066MSee C. (54) 122 and 128)
.   ,2r:. .,whether any and, if so, how many other Bills from List E can be accorded a placein the programme.Bills to Enable Emergency Powers to be Dispensed with. The Committee did not.overlook the political and other advantages ofdispensing altogether with the whole structure of emergency powers in the lifetime of the present Government-^an objective to which the Home Secretary has alreadydrawn the attention of the Home Affairs Committee (H.A. (54) 6th Meeting,Minute 2). They were informed that some six or more Bills in addition to those at present shown in List D might well be required to enable this objective to beachieved in full and they noted that a number of the measures which would be involved would be likely to cause difficulty with Government supporters and provegenerally! controversial. They recognised that, if the Government should decide to pursue this objective^ it would have to be assumed that there would be room for no other measures in the programme apart from bare essentials, if, indeed,the full objective could be attained even on that assumption. It appeared to theCommittee likely that, if the Cabinet should decide against pursuing this objective,the Home Secretary would press for the inclusion in the programme of some atleast of the Bills included in List D for example, those to replace the land and water powers, which have already been approved in principle by the Home AffairsCommittee-as a further instalment in the gradual process of dispensing withemergency powers.Scottish legislation. It was also the Committee&apos;s view that experience with Scottish Bills duringthe present Session made it desirable that special attention should be given to the load which the proposed programme for next session would impose upon ScottishMinisters and the Scottish Grand Committee. To facilitate this the Scottish Billshave been listed separately (List G). It seems unlikely to be possible to maketime available for more than the three Bills in parts (b) and (c) of that List.Bills suitable for Private Members6. In submitting a list (List H) of Bills suggested as suitable for handing to private Members successful in the ballot for Private Members Bills, the committee invited me to draw the attention of those of my colleagues concerned to the needfor approval of the policy of such Bills to be sought and obtained by the same procedure as for proposed Government Bills.Summary of recommendations. On the Commiftee&apos;s behalf I invite the Cabinet to approve a provisional programme for the 1954-55 Session comprising:  .     (i) List A Bills;(ii) Such of the Bills in List B as events may render essential;(hi) List C Bills;(iv) Whatever proportion of List D Bills the Cabinet may consider to bedesirable; . .(v) One of the major Bills, or groups of Bills, from List E specified in para-graph 3 above (if the Cabinet should decide against a major legislativeeffort to dispense with emergency powers) and possibly one or two other selected Bills from this List;(vi) The Scottish Bills shown under (b) and (c) in List G.The drafting of such measures will thereby be enabled to proceed, as opportunity offers, subject to policy haying been duly approved in each case,..8. At the same time I must ask my colleagues to refrain from making publicpromises of legislation on the strength of the inclusion of any Bill in whateverprovisional programme may be approved by the Cabinet. Authority to make suchpromises should continue to be sought in respect of each proposed measure in thenormal&apos;way;,     ... H QGwydyr House, S.W. 1.29th April, 1954 : ,    t       .
