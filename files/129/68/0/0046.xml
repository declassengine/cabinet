(54) 196 RECORD COPY14th June, 1954CABINETSOUTH-EAST ASIANote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for the information of my colleagues the text of a despatch toHer Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington covering a memorandum about thediscussions on the situation in South-East Asia between 29th March and22nd May, 1954.A. E.Geneva, 11th June, 1954.
DISCUSSIONS ON THE SITUATION IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA-MARCH 29TO MAY 22, 1954Mr. Eden to Sir Roger Makins (Washington)(No. 535. Secret) Foreign Office,Sir, June 12, 1954.The nature and the course of the discus-sions on the situation in South-East Asia ingeneral and Indo-China in particular whichhave taken place over the past two monthsbetween France, the United States and our-selves have been so important and at thesame time so intricate that I have thoughtit desirable for the enclosed account to beprepared in narrative form. I am indebtedfor this work to Lord Reading, who hasstudied all the documents and recordsavailable.It will be found that the discussions havecovered four quite separate, even if closely related, topics:  1. The long-term project of the creationof a South-East Asia defence organisation, intended to be per-manent in character and not devisedmerely to meet the immediate prob-lem.2. The short-term proposals for activearmed intervention in the Indo-China war with the object of pre-venting the fall of Dien Bien Phu or at least averting its more disastrous consequences, such as the possiblecollapse of all French resistancethroughout Indo-China.3. The consideration of the measures tobe taken to furnish effective inter-national guarantees of any settle-ment in Indo-China which might bereached at Geneva or, in default ofany settlement, to contain furtherCommunist advances in South-east asia.4. The institution of Five-Power Stafftalks, without commitment to thecountries participating, to recom-mend possible courses of action to check further Communist aggressionor infiltration in the region of South-East Asia as a whole.This account covers, amongst other things, the misunderstanding between theUnited States Government and her majesty&apos;s Government of what had been,agreed during Mr. Dulles&apos; visit to london on April 11 to 13. Although this misuncler-standing was unfortunate, it was aggravated by the publicity given to the intention ofthe United States Government to go aheadat once with ten members for the formationof a South-East Asia Defence Organisationwithout waiting for any preliminary confi-dential discussions about possible addi-tional Asian membership. The prospectof repairing our differences was still furtherimpaired by the publicity given to the pro-posals made by Mr. Dulles in Paris onApril 25 and later for active intervention in indo-China. In such circumstances any&apos;action to set up a South-East Asia defence organisation would have been taken as anacknowledgment that we had abandonedany hope of an arrangement at Geneva andwould have ended the possibility of Asianassociation with the project or even benevo-lence towards it. Since Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment attach great importance to thesuccessful establishment of such an Organi-sation, I decided that this aim should take precedence over any facile attempt to restore Anglo-United States unity at theexpense of our objective.I am copying this despatch to her majesty&apos;s Representatives at Paris, UnitedKingdom Conference Delegation, Geneva,Saigon, and Her Majesty&apos;s representative to United Nations at New York.I am, &amp;c.ANTHONY EDEN.
DISCUSSIONS   ON  THE   SITUATION   IN   SOUTH-EAST   ASIAMARCH 29 TO MAY 22,  1954At the conclusion of the Berlin Confer-ence, held between the 25th of january and the .18th of February, 1954, it was announced that the four Foreign ministers had agreed that a further conference, witha wider representation, should take place at Geneva, opening on the 26th of April,and that at that conference there shouldbe discussed in addition to the Koreansituation, &quot;the problem of restoring peace in Indo-China.&quot;Towards the end of March the war in indo-China was going badly and thedefenders of Dien Bien Phu were alreadyhard pressed.The United States Government seem tohave come to the conclusion at that stage that there was little likelihood of obtainingan acceptable settlement in Indo-China by negotiation and that consequently some form of armed intervention must be pre-pared. In his speech to the Overseas PressClub of America on the 29th of March Mr.Dulles described the extent of the dangers of the situation in Indo-China. He recom-mended that the United States should notpassively accept the possibility of Com-munist domination of South-East Asia and,While recognising that such a policy wouldinvolve serious risks, he urged that the threatshould be met &quot; by united action.&quot;On the 2nd of April&apos;, perhaps stimulated by Mr. Dulles&apos; speech, the French Govern-ment who viewed the situation in Dien BienPhu as critical, asked the United StatesGovernment for &quot; a massive air strike &quot; in1order to restore or at least to relieve theposition. This appeal, characterised byMr. Dulles as &quot; slightly hysterical&quot; and apparently made in a moment of panic bythe French Cabinet, was rejected by theUnited States Government without prior consulation with Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment of any kind. But it seems to have hadthe effect of leading Mr. Dulles to make avery urgent review of the situation in South-East Asia in general and Indo-China inparticular, from which emerged a plan forthe formation of an ad hoc coalition of interested countries, the United States, theUnited Kingdom, France, Australia, NewZealand, Siam, the Philippines and the threeAssociated States of Vietnam, Laos andCambodia, in order to block any furtherCommunist advance in South-East Asia.From the conversations which Mr. Dullesheld at the time with the Ambassadors ofthe United Kingdom, France, Australia, andNew Zealand, he appeared at that stage tohave in mind that this coalition should issue a declaration calling upon the People&apos;republic of China to desist from furtheraggressive moves. He also indicated hisplans to the representatives in Washingtonof India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma andIndonesia.On the 5th of April, the Prime Ministerreceived a personal letter from president eisenhower, pressing him to fall in with this plan, and suggesting that, if it were thought advisable, Mr. Dulles should cometo London for Urgent discussions. Theoffer of a visit by Mr. Dulles was promptlyaccepted, but at the same time I warnedSir Roger Makins in Washington that heshould say nothing at that stage that mightcommit us to&apos;the joint action proposed.My fear was that any such plan, if putinto execution in the immediate future,was likely gravely to compromise any pfos-pect of a successful issue to the geneva conference. Nor did I think that, as the rains were about to break, the military
situation in Indo-China was as critical asthe Americans believed, of that it would bepossible, even if it were desirable, toorganise any such coalition with sufficientspeed to make intervention in the DienBien Phu battle effective. I Was also satis-fied that there was no prospect of obtaining a lasting settlement by military meansalone, and I was most anxious that no steps should be taken publicly to put the planinto execution until I had had an oppor-tunity of consultation with the asian countries most closely concerned and inparticular with those who were members ofthe Commonwealth.In response to our invitation, Mr. Dullesarrived in London on the 11th of April fortalks which took place informally that evening and formally upon the two succeed-ing days. By that time he had apparentlymodified his idea of a Warning Declaration.A draft of such a Warning was producedoutside the meetings for us to look at, butit was never produced in the formal dis-cussions. Nor, indeed, did the americans have any other prepared document whenthey arrived. Presumably Mr. Dulles had come round to the view that the formationof the contemplated coalition would initself act as a sufficient deterrent to theChinese. He did not think that an imme-diate announcement of his plan would have any adverse effect upon the prospects ofGeneva, but rather the opposite.The American proposals clearly had two different aspects, the first the formation ofsome lasting collective security system for south-East Asia and the second the ques-tion of Allied intervention in the fighting in indo-China. I was ready to examine thefirst proposition further in confidentialconsultation with the United States, thoughdifficulties would arise both as regards themethods of associating the defence system with the United Nations and as to the selec-tion of those countries to whom invitations to join should be issued. In particular I pointed out the importance of Asian andespecially of Indian participation. Mr.Dulles said that if this matter were pressedhe Would be urged to accept participationby the Chinese nationalists in Formosa.No decision was reached and it was agreedthat in case of need it should be stated inreply to public questions that participationwas one of the matters1 that would need tobe further explored between our twogovernments. As regards&quot; intervention ifrIndo-China, I made clear my objections toany hasty action there with special referenceto its probable effect upon Geneva.At the end of our discussions a communique was issued (Annex A) whichset out the results of our discussions.Mr. Dulles then continued his journey to paris for similar discussions with the FrenchGovernment, whose views, especially inregard to the timing of any such proposals,appeared to be very close to our own.On the 16th of April, shortly after Mr.Dulles returned to Washington, it became clear that there was a sharp divergence ofVieW as to the timing of the next steps. Wehave since been given to understand thatMr. Dulles was under the impression that ithad been agreed in the course of our discus-sions in London that the examination towhich we referred in the communiqueshould begin at once. If so, he may havebeen led to this belief by the terms of thesecond and third paragraphs of the com.Lmunique, which could bear the interpreta-tion he put upon them. There was,however, no agreement at our meeting inLondon about the membership of the pro- ^posed collective security system. ^ ^this fact ^^^^ Iwas to have beenjpublic, by agreement inParliament if I had been questioned inthe matter. However, to select nine othercountries besides the United States, andpublicly to summon their representatives toa meeting, as Mr. Dulles subsequently pro-posed to do, would clearly have prejudicedthis issue of membership.Acting upon his interpretation of theposition and ignoring my insistence that india should not deliberately be excludedfrom the examination, Mr. Dulles arranged to summon the Ambassadors of the UnitedKingdom, France, Australia, New Zealand,the Philippines, Siam and the three Asso-ciated States on the 20th of April with aView to consulting with them as to their willingness to join the proposed coalitionand the procedure for establishing it.A meeting of representatives of these tencountries at that moment would certainly have been taken as crystallising the member-ship of the proposed coalition, a decision which would in my judgment have beenfatal to the whole plan.I therefore objected&apos; to this proposal andin the end, since the fact that a meeting wasto be held was already public, it wasdecided to convert it from its original pur-pose to a discussion of the Geneva Con-fefence amongst the representatives ofthose countries which would be participa-tirig in it.
On the 22nd of April I arrived in Paris forthe N.A.T.O. meeting and also for consul-tations with Mr. Dulles and MonsieurBidault preliminary to the opening of the geneva Conference on the 26th. I found the position there confused and depressing,M. Bidault in particular being in a state ofgreat exhaustion.Soon after my arrival I had a conversa-tion with Mr. Dulles at luncheon at whichhe began by saying that he wanted to clear up a misunderstanding between us over his proposed South-East Asia security system.I replied that I would welcome this. the colombo Conference was to open on thesame day as the Geneva Conference andI was most anxious that we should avoid any steps which might lead to the Govern-ments represented at Colombo coming outpublicly against our security proposals.While i had, of course, issued no invita-tions I had been in touch with certain ofthe Asian countries and thought that I hadbeen able to restrain them from any un-favourable expression of opinion. But i thought it very important that we shouldnot issue any list of countries to be invitedto join the security system until we had beenable to see more clearly the trend of Asianopinion. On the other hand I was quite ready to discuss very secretly withMr. Dulles the form and outline of theplan.Mr. Dulles replied that there were twoproblems, the first whether we could in anyway help the French out of their immediate difficulties and the second, the eventualmembership of the South-East Asiasecurity system. He was still eager to make an early start with the latter on the basis ofthe three Western Powers together with oneor two others, such as Australia, NewZealand and Thailand, the consultations tobe of a military as well as of a politicalcharacter. He thought that this might help to rouse the French from their defeatism.He said that he was being pressed to includeFormosa and Japan and that if we insistedupon bringing in India and Pakistan itwould make it very difficult for him to resist the pressure. I said that I could not accept that position and I believed that by the communique which we had issued after ourLondon talks we had done all that wasnecessary to strengthen ; our hands forGeneva. I would, however, be prepared to begin a military study with the UnitedStates Government on the possibilities ofdefence in South-East Asia in the event of a french collapse in Indo-China.Mr. Dulles painted a gloomy picture ofthe French attitude of mind, saying thatM. Bidault had told him that the situation at Dien Bien Phu was desperate and that french Government had almost made up their minds to quit the fight in Indo-Chinaaltogether. I reserved my own judgementon the position until we had an opportunityto talk to the French in the afternoon.At the meeting at the Quai d&apos;Orsay dis-cussion was desultory and unsatisfactory and we never really got down to an examination of the Indo-China problem.After the meeting I spoke to M. MauriceSchuman and General Ely, though I did not get much from them beyond the view thatthe situation in Dien Bien Phu was verydifficult.But from a conversation which her majesty&apos;s Ambassador had with M.Chauvel, who had been present at an earlierFranco-American meeting, it appeared thatthe French had in fact not been so possibility-mistic as the Americans had suggested andthat in any event there was no question of taking any vital decision at the moment.The first thing, according to M. Chauvel,was to wait and see whether any negotia-tions were possible at Geneva.I formed the view that the French posi-tion was actually extremely grave and likelyto make our task in Geneva most difficult,even if the collapse which the Americansexpected did not take place. But since there had been no suggestion of the Frenchinviting us or the Americans to send mili-tary help to Indo-China, it was agreed between the Americans and ourselves thatwe should leave the idea of a joint study ofthe military situation in abeyance for thetime being.It was clear to me that M. Bidault hadbeen irritated by the way in which mr. Dulles had tried to insist upon theFrench agreeing to enter into immediatenegotiations about the proposed securitysystem, and also by American pressure upon him to reveal exactly how he pro-posed to play his hand at Geneva.M. bidault&apos;s anxiety was obviously in-creased by the very difficult and delicatepolitical situation in France. But when Icalled upon M. Laniel on the morning ofApril 23, I found him in quite good heartand less agitated about Indo-China thanM. Bidault.
Later on the same day the situation againchanged for the worse. Mr. Dulles in-formed me that General Navarre had tele-graphed to the French Government to saythat only a powerful strike by the AmericanAir Force within the next seventy-two hours could save the situation at DienBien Phu. I replied that I could not see how any intervention from fleet-carriers atthis stage could prove effective in saving the fortress, but it might have far-reachingconsequences. General Gruenther, whowas also present, asked whether there wasanything that we could do to raise Frenchmorale, which he had never known at solow an ebb. Mr. Dulles seemed to sharemy view as to the probable ineffectivenessof intervention by air but said that, if Iwere prepared to stand with him, he was ready to recommend to the President thathe should ask Congress for special powersto take action involving the movement ofthe armed forces. He went on to read meextracts from a telegram from the Presi-dent, showing concern at the military news from Indo-China and seeming to imply thatwe were taking a rather indifferent attitude.I said that this last was certainly not thefact, but that I continued to be unconvincedthat outside intervention alone, even if theresources were immediately available, couldrestore the situation at this stage. On theother hand, if the Americans would be willing to discuss the possibility of givingmilitary aid to Siam, if there were a totalcollapse in Indo-China, I was prepared torecommend this course to my Government.Mr. Dulles agreed to this proposal.At the conclusion of our talk I told mr.. Dulles that I hoped that there wouldbe no response to the French appeal with-out prior consultation with us since it mighthave far reaching consequences for us all.Mr. Dulles gave me an assurance to this effect.On the 24th of April I had a further talk with Mr. Dulles and Admiral Radford.Mr. Dulles began by saying that he was now convinced that the French would not remain in the fight unless they were assured&quot; that we would do what we can within the presidents constitutional powers to jointhem in the fight.&quot; The French had saidthat an assurance that we would join themin defending the rest of Indo-China if DienBien Phu fell would not be enough. unless we participated by means of an air strike in the actual defence of the fortress, DienBien Phu would be &quot; their last battle.&quot;Mr. Dulles said that there was no possibilityof the United States participating in thedefence of the fortress, because the Presi-dent could not act quickly enough and because no intervention could now save thesituation. But he added that, if the french were confident that we would join in thegeneral defence of Indo-China, they mightnot throw in their hand altogether whenDien Bien Phu fell, in spite of what they said. The United States Governmentwould be willing to give the necessaryassurance, if the British agreed to partici-pate and if Congress approved.I asked what measures were contem-plated. Admiral Radford said that theremust be some immediate military effort and suggested that we might send R.A.F. units from Malaya or Hong Kong. He askedwhether we had not an aircraft carrier inthe area. No more specific plans wereforthcoming.Admiral Radford then went on to givea most pessimistic picture of the probableconsequences of the fall of Dien Bien Phu,saying that in his view the whole militarysituation in Indo-China would get out ofcontrol within a few days, that there mightbe riots in Saigon and Hanoi and that thewhole population might turn against theFrench. The only way he saw of prevent-ing this situation was to demonstrate that france now had powerful Allies in the fight.But it would involve forcing unpleasantdecisions upon the French such as to removeGeneral Navarre, and to give the Americansa voice in the planning of the High Com-mand and the training of Vietnamese troops.I said that the picture painted to us by theFrench had not been anything like so des-perate and I asked whether the Americansreally thought that air intervention coulddecisively alter the situation. We had tobear in mind what might be the effect on world opinion and how the Chinese wouldbe likely to react. I assumed that they hadnot forgotten the Russo-Chinese Alliance.If we sent forces into Indo-China, we might find ourselves fighting not only the Viet-minh but Vietnam and at the same. timeheading for a world war.Admiral Radford said that he had neverthought that the Chinese would intervene in Indo-China, nor had they the necessaryresources available. If they attempted air action this could be stopped by bombingthe very vulnerable airfields in China.Admiral Radford asked what were theviews of our Chiefs of Staff. I replied thatthey certainly considered Indo-China of thefirst importance for the defence of Thailandand Malaya but I did not know what belief
they had in the possibility of successfulmilitary intervention in Indo-China at thisstage. Personally I had the gravest doubts about this. From the political point of viewMr. Dulles was proposing to confrontBritish opinion with as difficult a problem as it would be possible to find. I would consult at once with Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and would probably fly home toLondon that night for the purpose.At the subsequent tripartite meeting atthe Quai d&apos;Orsay, Mr. Dulles began by say-ing that in view of the conflicting reportsthey must now have a clear understandingwhether the French would continue thefighting in Indo-China if Dien Bien Phu fell.If so, the United States would try toorganise as urgently as possible the defenceof the entire region as agreed in the Londonand Paris communiques. He appeared atone point to be implying that the Londoncommunique had in some way committedHer Majesty&apos;s Government to action in indo-China and I took occasion to saythat in my view there was no suchcommitment. M. Bidault supported me,and Mr. Dulles did not dissent.Mr. Dulles also produced the draft of aletter which he proposed to address toM. Bidault, if it would be thought helpful.The substance of it was that the UnitedStates Government would be prepared, ifthe French Government and their other allies wished, to take the necessary stepsto obtain special powers from the president to move armed forces into Indo-China andthus to internationalise the struggle againstcommunism in Indo-China and protectSouth-East Asia as a whole. There was no reference in this letter to the United King-dom, although Mr. Dulles had said morethan once in our earlier conversations thatif the United Kingdom was not prepared totake part he did not think that a majority would be found in Congress to give thePresident his special powers.M. Bidault, after some hesitation, finallysaid that he was prepared for Mr. Dullesto address the letter to him.It had by then become very clear thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government would have totake a decision of first-class importance. i therefore decided to return to London that night to discuss the position with mycolleagues, and to ask their approval of theattitude which I had adopted in refusing tojoin in any immediate discussions on thepossibility of Allied intervention in theIndo-China war or to give any undertaking in advance of Geneva concerning UnitedKingdom military action in Indo-China.I had prepared a paper [Annex B] definition-ing what I thought should be the attitude ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government. This was en-dorsed by my colleagues during ourconsultations in London.Just before I left London again on sunday the 25th of April, the french ambassador called upon me and told methat the Americans were prepared to go tothe help of the French with an air strikeprovided that the action they took was onthe basis of a joint Allied declaration inwhich he strongly urged that we should par-anticipate. I told M. Massigli that I would put this at once to my colleagues before leaving for Geneva. On my way I landed at Orly airport where M. Bidault unexpec-tedly met me and I gave him the substance of the paper referred to above and whichhad by then received the assent of mycolleagues. M. Bidault did not seem sur-prised at our attitude but was clearly mostgravely perturbed by the situation, and bythe publicity which had been given to it byan American press leakage. I stressed thatall our technical advisers believed that an air strike at Dien Bien Phu could notappreciably affect the outcome and that we accordingly felt that we were being asked to involve ourselves in an enterprise whichmight have the gravest consequences, but was most unlikely to achieve its purpose.After my arrival the same evening in geneva, Mr. Dulles came to see me and Iinformed him of our discussions in Cabineton the proposals which he had put to me inParis. We would give the French allpossible diplomatic support towards reach-ing an acceptable settlement at Geneva andthis would be much more effective than an unsuccessful attempt to intervene in thepresent battle. In no circumstances did wethink air action in Dien Bien Phu practical.In spite of his earlier insistence Mr. Dullesappeared now to agree as to the efficacy ofthe air strike, but he was very anxious thata concerted effort should be made tosupport the French more vigorously than could be done without acts of belligerency.We ought to make them feel that if theyfought on they would get help. He believedthat there was no chance that they would continue to fight unless they could be given some hope within the next few weeks thata common defensive system could be created which would safeguard at least partsof Indo-China. I replied that if an accept-able settlement could be arrived at we were
ready to guarantee it; if the attempt failed,we were prepared to examine the situationafresh; but we were not prepared to inter-vene now.The Geneva Conference opened on thefollowing day, the 26th of April, and afterthe opening session I had a further conver-sation with Mr. Dulles, who said that he wasnot very clear where we stood after theprevious night&apos;s discussion in relation to theterms of the London communique of the13 th of April. He asked whether we couldnot now proceed to discussions with theFrench on the basis of that document. I said that, as I had made it plain that wewere not prepared to intervene in Indo-China, there seemed no advantage at this time in a discussion as to the preparation ofmilitary defence if Indo-China were to beincluded in it.I later showed the Cabinet conclusions and my reports on my talks with Mr.Dulles, M. Bidault and M. Massigli to theMinisters of External Affairs of Canada,Australia and New Zealand, who were allemphatically in agreement with the lineadopted by the Cabinet.The Colombo Conference of the PrimeMinisters of India, Pakistan, Ceylon, burma and Indonesia, opened on the same day asthe Geneva Conference.I had throughout been anxious to keepthe three Asian members of the Common-wealth informed and, if possible, to bring them along in step with us, and on the27th of April I sent telegrams to the PrimeMinisters of India, Pakistan, and Ceylon,saying that I wished to proceed at Genevawith the approval of our Commonwealthpartners and that if any settlement couldbe reached over Indo-China it would bedesirable to obtain the widest possible measure of backing for it amongst allinterested parties. I enquired whether theycould contemplate being associated in any form with such a guarantee. I also gaveinstructions for the Government of burma to be approached on similar lines through diplomatic channels. The replies receivedwere on the whole encouraging.On the same day M. Massigli called inLondon upon the Prime Minister in orderto convey to him an urgent appeal fromM. Laniel that we should join with theUnited States in the declaration promisingmilitary help in Indo-China. The PrimeMinister informed the Ambassador that wecould not at this stage make any commit-ments beyond those of which I had in-formed Parliament on the 13th of Aprilafter Mr. Dulles&apos; visit to London.The Prime Minister subsequently made astatement on the position in the House ofCommons. On the 30th of April I had afurther conversation with Mr. Dulles, whoagain asked whether there was not any-thing that we could do to help the Frenchand suggested that it would hearten them ifwe now started to have talks in Washing-ton about the South-East Asia defence organisation. I said that I saw the same difficulties as before. If we were preparing to go to the help of the French in Indo-China, that was a course which her majesty&apos;s Government could not take. Ifwe were not, then I did not think that forus to pretend that we were doing so would help anybody.I dined on the evening of the 1st of Maywith Mr. Dulles,&apos; General Bedell Smith andsome of their advisers, when Mr. Dullesexpressed the view that the present situa-tion between us Was very disturbing since inthe past we had always been in agreement at Conferences, whereas we were now incomplete disarray. I said that I did not really know what it was that we were being asked to do in Indo-China, but that, if itwere that we should intervene with&apos; armed forces, I had already explained fully thereasons why any such action was impossible.Mr. Dulles said that he was not askingus for any military assistance but only forour moral support in any action that theymight take. I said that that was quite anew approach and I asked what kind ofaction they had in mind. Mr. Dulles repliedthat it had not yet been decided. I said thatwe must really see where we were going,for if the Americans went into the Indo-China war, the Chinese themselves would inevitably step up their participation andthe next stage would be that the americans and the Chinese would be fighting eachother, which would in all probability be thebeginning of the third world war.Mr. Dulles said that they were notthinking in terms of any large-scale inter-vention at the moment, but of training upVietnam forces to undertake the defence oftheir own country, which might take a yearto accomplish. In the interval they wouldhave to hold some sort of a bridgehead.It became apparent during this conversa-tion that the Americans were deeplyaggrieved by our refusal to support themin such military measures as they might think advisable, but that at the same time they had no definite plans of their own.I subsequently discussed this conversa-tion with my Commonwealth colleagues and was confirmed in my view that we must
follow a consistent line and refuse, pendingthe outcome of negotiations here, not onlyto be drawn into the Indo-China war,but to promise our moral support for measures, the full scope of which was stillunknown to us. We could on the otherhand repeat our assurances to the americans that we agreed to work withthem in building up a collective defence withthe widest possible Asian support to guaran-tee any settlement in Indo-China andassure the security of the rest of South-east asia.On the 30th of April I prepared a docu-ment (Annex C) which was not intendedas an official statement of Her Majesty&apos;governments views, but merely as a reflec-tion of my own thoughts; I gave a copyof this to Mr. Dulles and on the 2nd ofApril received a reply from him (Annex D)setting out his reactions to my views, and again asking whether we could not recon-sider our position and &quot; inject some newelement into the situation &quot; with the objectof providing the French with furtherencouragement to continue the fight.On the 3rd of May, Mr. Dulles leftGeneva and I saw him off at the airport.The first plenary sitting of the Confer-ence on Indo-China was held on this day.The same evening I had a talk with GeneralBedell Smith at dinner in which he expressedno enthusiasm for the view that sea andair intervention alone could be effective in indo-China and added that Americanground forces would only be sent there overhis dead body. He went on to explain thatin his opinion the immediate problem wasto encourage the French to hold on both onthe battlefield and at the Conference tableso as to gain time to organise a more effec-tive defence, whilst bringing pressure to bear upon the Chinese and the Russians to accepta tolerable settlement. He indicated thatthis double purpose explained the recentAmerican impatience to take active steps.We discussed the part that might be played by the existing Five-Power Staff Agency in working out plans to cover the results ofthe Geneva Conference, whether these were favourable , or unfavourable, and I againstressed the need at least to keep the asian countries informed of what was going on.It was on the basis of this conversationthat I/prepared a paper on the 4th of May(Annex E) stating my willingness to recom-mend that; Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould take part in a study by the Five-Power Staff Agency on the Indo-Chinasituation and on the 7th of May, I sent a personal message to the Prime ministers of India, Pakistan and Ceylon in order tokeep them fully informed.On the 10th of May, the Minister of Statemade a statement on the position in theHouse of Commons.On the 11th of May, I received a letterfrom General Bedell Smith which containedWashington&apos;s reply to my suggestion inregard to staff talks and indicated thedesire of the United States Authorities tomove forward on two parallel lines, first themilitary staff talks by five Powers and,secondly, a concurrent effort to constructthe South-East Asian defence organisa-tion. My own view remained unchangedthat it would be fatal at this stage to begindiscussions with a 10-Power group beforethe results of the Geneva Conference were known.On the 15th of May, there was a discon-certing incident. The Swiss papers reporteddiscussions between the French and UnitedStates Governments concerning the termsupon which the United States would beprepared to intervene in Indo-China. Wehad received no intimation that such con-versations were taking place and enquires as to the truth of the reports elicited no information that morning from eitherGeneral Bedell Smith or M. Bidault, but after my meeting with them, M. de Margerie,at M. bidault&apos;s request, gave me, in strict confidence, a full account of what hadtaken place. Later in the day, when theNew York Herald Tribune arrived, it con-tained detailed reports which enabled me,without breaking the confidence of theFrench, to ask to see General Bedell Smithand to enquire from him what the truth ofthe matter was.General Bedell Smith, who was greatlyupset that we had not been informed, atcnce showed me copies of telegrams between Washington and Paris from whichit was apparent not only that these conver-sations were taking place, but that the inten-tion was that we should not be informed of them until they had been concluded. he undertook to keep us fully informed infuture.At a meeting with M. Bidault andGeneral Bedell Smith on the morning of the15th, the latter raised for the first time thequestion of bringing the United Nationsinto the South-East Asian picture by per-suading the Siamese to revive their plan ofJune last to secure the despatch of a Peace
Observation Commission to the Indo-Chinese/Siam frontier. This proposalcreated obvious difficulties and both I andthe French Delegation had doubts about itswisdom at that stage.Meanwhile, the question of staff talks in washington had been proceeding, but inview of the situation which had developedover the conversations between the Frenchand the Americans, I felt bound to reserveour position until the situation had been cleared as to the real American intentionsabout intervention in Indo-China. On the17th of May I had a talk with M. Bidaultabout this aspect of the matter, from whichit was clear that there was no questionof the French Government requestingAmerican intervention until the conference was over. As a result of my conversations with him and also with General BedellSmith, I stated that I was now preparedto go forward with Five-Power Staff talks on the understanding that the UnitedKingdom was not thereby committed. Onthe following day the Prime Minister agreedthat staff talks could now proceed and theterms of reference for the discussions were agreed.On the 19th of May, at a meeting withM. Bidault and General Bedell Smith, thelatter again raised the question of the appeal by Siam to the United Nations towhich both the French and ourselves con-tinued to see substantial difficulties bothtactical and procedural, since to raise thematter at this moment might well wreckthe chance of a successful outcome atGeneva, and at the same time mightalienate public opinion as being too trans-parent a manoeuvre on the part of theUnited States to secure United Nationscover for intervention in Indo-China. Atthis meeting it also became apparent thatthe Americans were already impatient ofthe slow progress made and were anxiousto revert to plenary sessions, although only two restricted sessions had so far been held.I expressed the emphatic view that wemust give the experiment a full and fairtrial, and M. Bidault confined himself tothe simple statement that to adopt theAmerican proposal would mean the fall ofthe French Government.This was the position when I returnedto England on the 22nd of May, afterattending the Entente Cordiale celebrationsin Paris, when I had the opportunity ofagain consulting my colleagues at a cabinet meeting on the morning of the 24th of Maybefore returning to Geneva later in thesame day.Annex AAt the conclusion of their meetings inLondon on April 12 and 13, during whichthey discussed a number of matters of com-mon concern, Mr. Foster Dulles andMr. Anthony Eden, issued the following statement:  &quot; We have had a full exchange of views with reference to South-East Asia. Wedeplore the fact that on the eve of the geneva Conference the Communistforces in Indo-China are increasinglydeveloping their activities into a large-scale war against the forces of the FrenchUnion. They seek to overthrow the law-ful and friendly Government of Vietnamwhich we recognize and they have in-vaded Laos and Cambodia. We realizethat these activities not only threatenthose now directly involved, but also en-danger the peace and security of theentire area of South-East Asia and theWestern Pacific, where our two nations and other friendly and allied nations havevital interests.&quot; Accordingly we are ready to take part, with the other countries principally concerned, in an examination of thepossibility of establishing a collective defence, within the framework of the charter of the United Nations, to assure the peace, security and freedom ofSouth-East Asia and the Western Pacific.&quot;It is our hope that the Geneva Con-ference will lead to the restoration ofpeace in Indo-China. We believe thatthe prospect of establishing a unity ofdefensive purpose throughout South-east asia and the Western Pacific will con-tribute to an honourable peace in Indo-China.&quot;Annex BIndo-China : Attitude of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernmentDraft prepared by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs for Consideration.1. We do not regard the London Com-munique as committing us to join in immediate discussions on the possibility ofAllied intervention in the Indo-China war.2. We are not prepared to give anyunder-takings now, in advance of Geneva, con-cerning United Kingdom military action in indo-China.
3. But we shall give all possible diplo-matic support to the French Delegation atGeneva in efforts to reach an honourablesettlement,4. We can give an assurance now that ifa settlement is reached at Geneva we shalljoin in guaranteeing that settlement and insetting up a collective defence in South east asia, as foreshadowed in the London Com-munique, to make that joint guaranteeeffective.5. We hope that any Geneva settlementwill make it possible for the joint guarantee to apply to at least the greater part of Indo-China.6. If no such settlement is reached weshall be prepared at that time to consider with our Allies the action to be takenjointly in the situation then existing.7. But we cannot give any assurance now about possible action on the part of theUnited Kingdom in the event of failure toreach agreement at Geneva for a cessation of hostilities in Indo-China.8. We shall be ready to join with theUnited States Government now in studyingmeasures to ensure the defence of Siam andthe rest of South East Asia, includingMalaya, in the event of all or part of Indo-China being lost.Annex CCommunism in Asia cannot be checkedby military means alone.. The problem isas much political as military; if any militarycombination is to be effective, it must enjoy the widest possible measure of Asiansupport.2. We should aim to get the support of burma as well as Siam as the immediateneighbours of Indo-China. But Burma willnot come in unless the project commandssome sympathy from other Asian countries,particularly the Asian members of theCommonwealth.3. If we cannot win the active supportof all the Asian countries of the area, it isimportant that we should, at the very least,secure their benevolent neutrality.4. To secure this widely based Asian sup--port, we must prepare the ground carefullyfor what is, in any case, intended to be a lasting defensive organisation, not a hastily-contrived expedient to meet the present crisis.5. This does not mean that we desire to delay. On the contrary, we have alreadybeen actively using our influence, particu-larly with  the Asian members  of  theCommonwealth, with encouraging results.Pakistan and Ceylon have already promisednot to oppose a South-East Asian collective defence on the lines we envisage,, and wehave succeeded in diverting Mr. Nehrufrom his original intention of condemningit root and branch. We have thus avertedthe danger that the Asian Prime ministers at Colombo would unite in condemning ourproject, and have grounds for hoping forthe actual support of some of them.6. Mr. Nehru&apos;s latest statement showsthat his ideas have moved closer to ourown. With persistence, we may evensecure his endorsement of the kind of nego-tiated settlement in Indo-China that wouldbe acceptable to us.7. While we do not believe that a Frenchcollapse in Indo-China could come about as rapidly or as completely as the Americansappear to envisage, this danger reinforcesthe need to lay the foundations of a widerand viable defence organisation for South-East Asia.8. We propose, therefore, that the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom should begin an immediate and secret joint exami-nation of the political and military prob-iems, involved in creating a collective defence for South-East Asia, namely:  (a) nature and purpose;(b) membership;(c) commitments.This examination should also coverimmediate joint measures to stiffen Siam.Annex DLetter from Mr. Dulles to the Secretary ofState: May 2&quot; I am taking back to Washington fordiscussion with the President the Memo-randum on South-East Asia Defence, which you gave me on April 30. I think thereis much in it with which we would go along.However, it does not seem to me that the eighth paragraph proposing immediate and secret joint examination between theUnited States and the United Kingdom isin itself adequate.Your paragraph 7 says that you do notthink that a French collapse in Indo-Chinacould come about as rapidly or as com-pletely as we appear to envisage. I hopeyou are right. I think, however, that Ourpessimistic view will almost surely provecorrect if France is left at this moment withvirtually no alternative to a lonely, hopeless
negotiation, which will * amount to uncon-ditional surrender. I think it imperative that we inject some new element into thesituation, and I believe that the least weshould do would be to invite the Frenchinto at least certain phases of our talks and let this be known.We have just had a meeting of theANZUS Council at which Australia andNew Zealand indicated a willingness to pro-ceed with military discussions with your government and mine and France, and withthe desirability of Thailand being brought in. This last is in accordance with the con-cluding paragraph of your Memorandum.If we do nothing in the way of planning a common defense until every last detailof nature and purpose, membership and commitments is agreed upon between our two governments acting secretly, then i fear circumstances will move against us sorapidly that what we do agree upon willhave been rendered obsolete by events.Could not your Government reconsider its position as expressed in your Memorandumat least to the extent of enabling us to helpprovide Bidault with some element of hope,which might enable him to gather thepolitical strength to hold off from the surrender which otherwise seems inevit-able.&quot;Annex EIn his statement in the House of Com-mons on April 22 the Prime ministers aid:  &quot; My Right Hon. Friend has of coursemade it clear to his colleagues at Genevathat if settlements are reached at Geneva,Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be readyto play their full part in supporting themin order to promote a stable peace in theFar East.&quot; I am ready to recommend that her majesty&apos;s Government should take partat once with the United States, France,Australia and New Zealand in a study tobe undertaken by the Five-Power StaffAgency of the implications of such sup-port for an Indo-China settlement. Inaddition to military questions, there will certainly be political and economic prob-lems which will require urgent examina-tion. For this purpose we suggest that political and economic experts should beattached to the Agency as appropriate.&quot; This study would be of direct interestto a number of other countries, notably the Powers represented at the ColomboConference and Siam, which would benaturally concerned with supporting anIndo-China settlement. It would be understood that these countries would beinformed of the intention to initiate the study, kept suitably advised of the pro-gress of the work and, where appropriate and by agreement, invited to take part.&apos;: A joint public announcement of our intentions would be issued. It would ofcourse be essential that this should be carefully considered and agreed upon.&quot; The present terms of reference of theFive-Power Staff Agency would requireamendment in order to make clear thecircumstances to which the study is toapply.&quot;
