Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1954SECRETC. (54) 1603rd May, 1954CABINETRECRUITMENT OF UKRAINIANS INTO THE MIXED SERVICEORGANISATIONMemorandum by the Minister of state the Foreign Secretary wished his colleagues to be consulted about a recentrequest of the Commander-in-Chief, Northern Army Group, to. be allowed to recruit Ukrainian displaced persons in the British Zone of Germany into the MixedService Organisation (M.S.O.). He considered this request before leaving london for Paris and Geneva and his views are set out in this memorandum.2. The M.S.O. consists of nearly 8,000 men employed by the Army on variousauxiliary services, such as transport. Unlike the German Service Organisation(G.S.O.) which consists only of Germans, it is composed wholly of non-Germans,mainly Poles and also some Baits. It makes an important contribution to the man-power of our forces, which will be even more important after the Bonn Conventionscome into force and the G.S.O. later disappears. Its support would also be ofthe greatest value during the first days of any hostilities before our units couldbe reinforced. It is at present about 10 per cent, under strength and its numbers are still falling. If its strength is not maintained, the Northern Army Group&apos;soperational plans will almost certainly be affected. The Ukrainian displaced persons are the only important source from which new recruits can come. Becauseof our man-power shortage, there is no prospect of making good the deficiency fromBritish sources.3.   The objections to recruiting these Ukrainians are:  (a) There may be a sharp Soviet reaction if we recruit persons whom theRussians regard as Soviet nationals.(b) There might be criticism from the French since many Ukrainians inGermany served during the last war in an S.S. Division in France.4. For the following reasons, however, the above objections do not seemoverriding:  (a) We have already recruited Poles and Baits into the M.S.O.  Although theformer are in a somewhat different category from the Ukrainians, thelatter are just as much Soviet citizens in the eyes of the Russians.(b) The Americans already employ individual Ukrainians in the United states army on various labour tasks. This has not produced any Russianoutburst.(c) Apart from protesting and making as much propaganda as possible outof the issue, it is hard to see what effective counter-action the Russianscould take.(d) Her Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Paris say that the S.S. Division in which someof the Ukrainians may have served did not acquire any specialnotoriety.5. The recruits will, of course, be screened as fully as possible, but we cannot now establish the full war-time records of the former S.S. members so completelyas to be certain of excluding really unsuitable persons.46105CABINET OFFICE-RECORD copy copy No.  6 8
6. This is a matter in which military requirements must be weighed againstpolitical disadvantages. V If vwe^agree to the&apos;proposal there is a danger of criticismin Parliament and from the Russians. But the military considerations are veryweighty and are reinTorcedBy the facf &quot;that we &quot;have been criticised in the North&quot;Atlantic Treaty Organisation for failing to provide sufficient support troops forour forces in Germany. The Foreign Secretary, in agreement with the Ministerof Defence and the Secretary of State for War, has therefore concluded that military requirements should prevail. ^,7. In these circumstances the Foreign Secretary proposes to,?agree,to the recruitment of the Ukrainians on the understanding that (a) the matter is given the minimum of publicity;(b) the most effective screening safeguards are adopted to ensure so far aspossible that persons with unsavoury records are excluded.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,3rd May, 1954.
