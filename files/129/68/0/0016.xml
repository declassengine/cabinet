Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1954SECRETCopy No.65C. (54) 16619th May, 1954CABINET OFFICERECQfiD COPYCABINETREPORT OF THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON CAPITAL punishment memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister for Welsh Affairs and the Secretary of State for scotland we submit our conclusions on the recommendations of the Royal Commissionon Capital Punishment.The Terms of Reference2.   The terms of reference of the Commission were as follows:  &quot; To consider and report whether liability under the criminal law in GreatBritain to suffer capital punishment for murder should be limited or modified,and if so, to what extent and by what means, for how long and under what conditions persons who would otherwise have been liable to suffer capital punishment should be detained, and what changes in the existing law and the prison system would be required; and to enquire into and take account ofthe position in those countries whose experience and practice may throwlight on these questions.&quot;The Commission was precluded from considering whether capital punishmentshould be retained or abolished. They were in effect required to consider whether any practicable half-way house could be found between the existing law, underwhich every person convicted of murder (except a person under 18 or an expectantmother) must be sentenced to death, and the abolition of the death penalty.The Commission were also asked to consider whether any change should bemade in the method of execution and to examine some subsidiary questions which did not strictly fall within their terms of reference.The Major recommendations.   The most important recommendations are the three following:  (a) that the statutory age limit below which the sentence of death may notbe imposed should be raised from 18 to 21;(b) that in all other cases the jury should be given discretion to decide whether there are such extenuating circumstances as to justify substituting the sentence of imprisonment for life for the sentence of death; and(c) that the test of criminal responsibility laid down in England by theM&apos;Naghten Rules should be wholly abrogated and that the jury shouldbe left to determine, unfettered by any formula, whether at the timeof the act the accused was suffering from a disease of the mind ormentally deficient to such a degree that he ought not to be held responsible.Of these recommendations, the first and the third are not unanimous. Thesecond is put forward in qualified terms, falling short of a clear recommendation.The three recommendations are considered in paragraphs 4-11 below.Raising the Age Limit4. The Commission recommend the raising of the age limit by a majorityof one (six to five). The recommendation is based mainly on the view that persons under 21 cannot be regarded as fully mature, and, however heinous theircrimes, are often capable of reformation.   The minority express the view that46174
where a murder is committed by a youth of 19 or 20 who has a criminal recordand shows no apparent signs of special immaturity or instability, there is no sufficient reason for exempting him from the scope of the death penalty, and theyconsider that it would be dangerous and inopportune to raise the age limit at atime when crimes of violence on the part of persons between 17 and 21 are soprevalent.We agree with the minority.Vesting of Discretion as to Sentence in the Jury5. The Commission say that &quot; the outstanding defect of the law of murderis that it provides a single punishment for a crime widely varying in culpability &quot;-;that this &quot; rigidity &quot; is at present mitigated mainly by the use of the Prerogativeof Mercy, a method in their view open to criticism; and that they have, therefore,sought for some other method of doing what is now done by the exercise of the prerogative.6. The Commission reject proposals for the division of murder into twodegrees, on the ground that it is impossible to frame a satisfactory definition of murder in the first degree, &quot; because no legal definition can cover all themultifarious considerations, relating to the offender as well as to his crime, which ought to be taken into account (and are at present taken into account by theSecretary of State) in deciding whether the supreme penalty should be exacted ineach individual case.&quot;   With this conclusion we agree.7. The Commission argue that the only practicable way of limiting thepresent liability to suffer capital punishment would be to leave the present scope and definition of murder unaltered and to &quot; give either to the Judge or to the jurya discretion to decide in each particular case, in the light of all the informationbefore the court, whether the sentence of death is appropriate, and, if it appearsto them that it is not, to impose or to recommend a lesser punishment.&quot; Theyreject the proposal that such a discretion should be given to the trial judge; andconclude that the alternative of entrusting such a power to the jury is said to workwell on the whole in the countries where it has been adopted, that if it were adoptedin Great Britain a workable procedure could be devised, and that it is &quot; the only practicable way of enabling the courts, instead of the executive, to take accountof extenuating circumstances so as to correct the rigidity which is the outstandingdefect of the existing law.&quot;   They add:  &quot; We recognise that the disadvantages of a system of &apos; jury discretion&apos;may be thought to outweigh its merits. If this view were to prevail, theconclusion would seem to be inescapable that in this country a stage has beenreached where little more can be done effectively to limit the liability to sufferthe death penalty, and that the issue is now whether capital punishmentshould be retained or abolished.&quot;8. This recommendation was the subject of a debate in the House of lords on 16th December, 1953. It was attacked by the late Lord Simon and by LordSamuel, Lord Waverley, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Oaksey, Lord Tucker andLord Asquith. It was supported by Lord Templewood and Lord Chorley. Theobjections raised to the Commission^ proposal were that it was inconsistent withthe traditional conception of the functions of the jury and that it would impose on them a responsibility which they were not equipped to discharge and which it wasnot fair to ask them to bear.The Commission themselves recognised that the disadvantages of the proposal might be held to outweigh its merits, and we have no doubt that it ought to be rejected. We see no reason to think that any change in the existing law and practice is required.Criminal Responsibility9. Three members dissociated themselves from the recommendation that inEngland the M&apos;Naghten Rules should be abrogated, on the ground that, while theRules were in some respects inadequate, it had not been shown that some criterionwas not needed. The advantage of a formula was that it served to limit the arbitrary element and to promote uniformity, as well as to help the jury to decide between conflicting views, and that to have no rule at all would be to leave thedecision on which a man&apos;s life often depended to the uncertain variations of ethicalstandard and&quot; emotional reaction which might influence the minds of members of ajury. These members thought that the objections to the M&apos;Naghten Rules as they
18th May, 1954.now stood would be substantially met by the adoption of a formula which themajority of the Commission regarded as a second best to dispensing with a formulaaltogether, namely that&quot; the jury must be satisfied that, at the time of committing the act, the accused,as a result of disease of the mind (or mental deficiency), (a) did not know thenature and quality of the act, or (b) did not know that it was wrong, or (c) wasincapable of preventing himself from committing it.&quot;&apos;They suggested that if this formula was unacceptable as a substitute for theM&apos;Naghten Rules a committee including members of the legal and medicalprofessions should consider this matter anew.10. As Home Secretary I have no doubt that the minority were right in con-sidering that in England some formula is essential. The Commission themselvesrecognised that the theoretical defects of the M&apos;Naghten Rules led to little hardshipor injustice in practice, and my conclusion is that, in view of the difficulty of framinga satisfactory amendment of the Rules and the division of opinion among theCommission, no advantage would be gained by disturbing the present position. Ifit should prove that there is strong pressure for amending the law in this respect, Ithink that the best course would be to adopt the suggestion of the minority andappoint an expert committee, including doctors and lawyers, to examine theproblem, but I am not anxious to pursue this suggestion.11. The Commission also recommend that the tests of insanity on arraign-ment (or, in Scotland, of insanity in bar of trial) and of insanity as a defence shouldmake no distinction in law between mental deficiency and insanity. It is true thatin both England and Scotland the position of a mental defective charged with a capital offence is not entirely clear under the existing law. In practice, however,a person of gross mental defect would, in England, be found insane on arraign-ment or guilty but insane, or, if convicted, would probably be reprieved, while inScotland he would be likely to benefit by the doctrine of diminished responsibility and be convicted of culpable homicide. Whatever the verdict of the court, theresult would ordinarily be that he would be removed to a State institution formental defectives. We therefore see no urgent need for amendment of the lawon this point. Existing statutory definitions in England and Wales of mentaldefectiveness may be affected by the recommendations of the Royal Commissionon the law relating to mental illness and mental deficiency.Minor Recommendations12. Our colleagues should also be aware of some of the less importantrecommendations of the Commission which are set out in the Appendix. Of these recommendations all except four would require legislation. Of these four, (d) isbeing put into effect as far as possible, although there are some practical difficulties:proposals have already been approved for the provision in England of an institutionon the lines of that proposed in (/); (/) does not call for any immediate action; and(k) is being considered with the local authorities concerned.Conclusions13. The three major recommendations of the Commission are all unaccep-table. The minor recommendations include some useful amendments of the law(although we are doubtful about (b) and (e)), but we are against introducing legis-lation now to give effect to them it would be something of an anti-climax tointroduce a Bill dealing with nothing but comparatively minor points, the way would be open to amendments embodying the less acceptable recommendations,and controversy about the death penalty itself would be revived.14. We think, however, that it may be necessary before long to find timefor a debate on the Commission^ Report. If there is such a debate, we suggestthat the Government spokesman should not announce that the Government haverejected the main recommendations but should take the line that the government feel grave doubts about accepting these recommendations, but in coming to a final conclusion will wish to take account of the views expressed by Parliament. Itshould be borne in mind that if there is a debate there is bound to be a discussion on whether capital punishment should or should not be continued, notwithstanding that this question did not come within the terms of reference of the RoyalCommission.D. M. F.
APPENDIXMinor recommendations of the Commission(a) The abolition of the doctrine of &quot; constructive malice &quot; in English law,with the proviso that principals in the second degree and accessoriesbefore the fact to felony should remain liable to be convicted of murderif the principal in the first degree is so liable.(b) Amendment of the law relating to provocation, to provide that, where thejury consider that the accused was deprived of self-control by suchprovocation as might have so deprived a reasonable man, the nature,as distinct from the degree, of the provocation should be immaterial;it should be open to the jury to return a verdict of manslaughter not-withstanding that provocation may have been by words alone. TheCommission consider that any such legislation should apply also to scotland.(c) Under the existing law in England the survivor of a suicide agreement isguilty of murder. The Commission recommend that the law shouldbe amended to provide that any person who aids, abets, or instigatesthe suicide of another person should be guilty only of that offence, not of murder, and should be subject to a maximum sentence of imprison-ment for life. No change is recommended in Scotland, where neithersuicide nor attempted suicide is a criminal offence.(d) In England and Wales the mental state of every prisoner charged withmurder should be examined by two doctors, one usually an outsidepsychiatrist and the other an experienced prison doctor. No change is recommended in the existing practice in Scotland.(e) The judge, both in England and Scotland, should be given power to raisethe issue of insanity, if it has not been raised by the defence and he considers that the trial of this issue would be in the interests of justice.(/) The Commission support the proposal to establish an institution for the detention and treatment of psychopaths and other prisoners who arementally abnormal, though not insane. They recommend that similar provision should be made in Scotland.(g) The wording of the sentence of death, both in England and Scotland,should be shortened.(h) The term &quot; imprisonment during Her Majesty&apos;s Pleasure&quot; should besubstituted for &quot; imprisonment for life &quot; in order to bring the wording of the sentence into conformity with its reality.(i) The Commission conclude that neither electrocution nor the gas chamberhas on balance any advantage over hanging as now carried out in thiscountry. They say that the method of lethal injection presents too many difficulties at present, but recommend that its practicability shouldperiodically be examined.(/) The Commission recommend that a notice should no longer be postedon the prison gate before and after execution, but that instead pressnotices should be issued.(k) The Commission recommend that in Scotland the prison authorities,rather than the magistrates, should undertake preliminary arrange-ments for executions, should appoint the assistant (but not theprincipal) executioner, and should make arrangements for burial.
