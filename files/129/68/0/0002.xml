secret,(54) 15224th April, 1954CABINET office record COPY/COPY NO.CABINETEFFECT ON COLONIAL. EXPORTS OF RELAXINGUNITED KINGDOM IMPORT RESTRICTIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the Chief Minister of Jamaica will be leading a deputation to london in May to discuss various matters relating to Jamaican exports.    In anticipa-tion of this visit, I wish to draw the attention of my colleagues to the effecton some Colonial producers (mainly, but not only, in the West Indies) of our recent and contemplated relaxations of import restrictions.    As the balanceof payments of the sterling area improves and restrictions can no longer bejustified by the need to protect our external financial position, someColonial producers, particularly in the poorer territories such as theWest Indies, are being faced with competition which they are ill-equipped to withstand.    If such producers lose their place in the markets of theUnited Kingdom the political consequences, especially in Colonies such as british Honduras, where constitutional problems are already causingdifficulty, could be very grave indeed.2.        I do not wish to imply that the relaxation of import restrictions isnot justified or that it is generally harmful to the Colonies.    Indeed in this context it is misleading to speak of a &quot;Colonial&quot; interest as such.    Moreover,-the argument cuts both ways.    We have consistently adopted the policy thatimport restrictions by Colonial Governments can only be justified on balanceof payments grounds and have for that very reason incurred criticism from united Kingdom industries over the relaxation of Colonial restrictions on japanese trade.    The benefits of multilateral trade to the sterling area asa whole are obvious and a freer economy suits the interests of many(perhaps most) Colonial producers.    There are, however, some Colonialindustries which are being hard hit by the return to normal trading conditions, and they are for the most part in Colonies which can ill affordloss of revenue and income and which are politically sensitive.    I shallmention here three current examples, but we must assume that there willbe others from time to time:-(a) As a result of import restrictions the Jamaica cigarindustry had a virtual monopoly of the United kingdom market from 1940 to 1951.    Increasing quotas for Cubancigars have been given as a result of the Anglo^Cubantrade agreements of 1951 and 1953.(b) Since the war the United Kingdom has been short of bananasand it is now proposed to license freely imports from non-dollar, non-sterling sources.    The &quot;West Indianproducers, particularly those in Jamaica, who are justrecovering from the effects of hurricanes in the yearsafter the war, believe that a sudden return to competition in the United Kingdom market will prejudice the recovery of their industry and spoil their chances of expansion.
(c)    The import of surplus citrus from the United States underSection 550 of the Mutual Security Act0 is in a rather different category,, since import restrictions are beingrelaxed not in consideration of our balance of paymentsbut in consideration of defence aid.    Despite the safe-guards on which we have insisted, citrus producers inBritish Honduras, Jamaica, Trinidad, the WindwardIslands and Cyprus see this arrangement as a first step to restoring the United States&apos; citrus trade to its pre-war position in the United Kingdom rs marketsf and since they have long been concerned by the effect ofUnited States and other export subsidies, they considerthat the most important of the few markets they have left is now being put in jeopardy.3.        These three commodities all affect Jamaica and these are the main reasons which have inspired the Government of that Colony to send the delegation already mentioned in order to seek protection for Jamaicanexports, though no doubt the discussions will in fact cover a wider fieldthan this (e. g. sugar).    Moreover, we must expect criticism of our policynot only from the Colonies concerned but in Parliament,,    We shall be told that the United Kingdom was in favour of Government purchases and long-term contracts when they enabled us to get scarce supplies cheaply, butthat we are not prepared to look after Colonial producers now that  -appliesare more plentiful and prices are lower.    We may be able to answer thesecriticisms in individual instances^ but, unless we do something to temperthe wind to these producers who may be in difficulty as a result of our policy, we sha.ll not find it easy to counteract the criticism that we arecareless of the interests of Commonwealth producers as a whole,,4.        As improvements in the balance of payments of the sterling areajustify further relaxation of restrictions on imports into the United Kingdom,so too we must continue to ensure that the Colonies also benefit by greater freedom to import non-sterling (particularly dollar) goods.    In theory wecan make a lot of the argument that our policy of using import restrictionssolely to protect the balance of payments is followed consistently in both directions of trade.    But unless the Colonies see a corresponding increasein their authorised dollar and other non-sterling expenditure the argumentcrumbles away.5.        There are few means of providing direct protection for the Colonialproducers.    Government purchase and long-term contracts cannot easily be reconciled with a return to freedom or with the Governments tradingpolicy.    Import controls which, during and since the war, have protectedCommonwealth producers must disappear as prosperity returns.    TheUnited Kingdom has no legislation for countervailing and anti-dumping duties which might be used to protect Colonial exporters against subsidisedcompetitors.6.        There remain only direct financial assistance by Her majesty&apos;sGovernment and Imperial Preference.    Some of the industries which maybe adversely affected by the return to freedom have been started with the encouragement of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in order to diversify Colonialeconomies.    Some of them may not be highly competitive but they will needsome help, at least for a time, if they are to get the capital for improvedplant and to acquire enough technical experience to develop standardscomparable to those of established industries elsewhere.    It may sometimesbe advisable to assist them to improve their efficiency and their marketing
&quot;7standards from United Kingdom fundso    At the moment I have no preciseproposals on this point to put forward, but I should like my colleagues toknow that I shall have this point in mind in considering the future of theColonial Development and Welfare arrangements (C (53) 167).70        The Imperial Preference system is often ineffective because some of the duties are specific and have remained unchanged for manyyears although the prices of commodities have risen substantially inthe meantime.    For instance, the preferential margin on cigars is nowless absolutely than before the war, although the full duty is more than three times as high as it then was;  the duty on bananas has remained unchanged since 1932, although the price is about 2.f times what it wasthen;  and the duty on fresh citrus is the same as it was before the warsalthough prices are almost 3 times as high (there is no duty on cannedcitrus).8.        The terms of the &quot;no new preference&quot; rule of the General Agree-ment on Tariffs and Trade as at present applied preclude the increase of specific duties to restore their former ad valorem incidence.    The Agree&quot;ment is to come up for review by the Contracting Parties later this year,and Departments are now considering what changes in it we should endeavour to secure.9.        I am giving further consideration to this whole problem and may find it necessary to submit recommendations to my colleagues on it at alater stage.    There will, naturally, be full interdepartmental consultationabout the line to be taken in dealing with the delegation from Jamaica0Colonial Office, S.W.U23rd April, 1954*&apos;
