Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1954CONFIDENTIALCopy No.  6C. (54) 17828th May, 1954cabinet office record copyCABINETTHE FAR east note by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for the information of my colleagues the annexed minute byMr. W. D. Allen, Under-Secretary in charge of Far Eastern Affairs in the ForeignOffice, concerning a conversation between General Bedell Smith and M. Molotovat Geneva on 22nd May, 1954.27th May, 1954.General Bedell Smith&apos;s Talk with m. MolotovThe United States Delegation showed me last night their record of the con-versation which took place after dinner on Saturday night 22nd May. The generalatmosphere seems to have been similar to that which prevailed when the Secretaryof State had dinner with M. Molotov. The United States record describedM. Molotov as being completely at ease and relaxed and friendly. The conversationseems to have been frank and useful.On Indo-China M. Molotov agreed that the situation in Cambodia and Laoswas different from that in Vietnam but he maintained that the Governments ofthe first two countries had effective control over little more than one half of their territories. After M. Molotov had referred to the apparent warlike intentions ofthe United States, General Bedell Smith said that the United States wanted peace in Indo-China but would not be prepared to associate itself with what it regardedas capitulation to aggression.On Korea M. Molotov had said that he thought the two halves of the country would take some time to learn to live together and appeared quite reconciled tothe continued division of the country. General Bedell Smith referred to thehistory of the United States&apos; effort in Korea as proof of the pacific intentions ofthe United States. He said that the United States could easily have avoidedAmerican casualties and shortened the war by carrying on more intensive and widespread operations. But it had deliberately refrained from doing so in order toavoid the risks of a Third World War. On the other hand, those who wished todeal with the United States must understand that they would not be prepared tomake any sacrifice of important principles and that compromise requiredconcessions by both sides.M. Molotov more than once referred to China as a young country, implying that it was excitable and had yet to learn restraint. But China, like Russia, neededabove all a period of peace to devote herself to internal reconstruction.General Bedell Smith referred to the imprisonment of Americans in Chinaand M. Molotov showed himself well-informed on the subject and immediatelyreferred to the Chinese students retained in the United States, adding that somesettlement of this mutual problem ought to be possible.There was also some discussion about colonialism. General Bedell Smithpointed out that talk of this kind was completely out of date now that India,Pakistan, Burma, Indonesia and the Philippines had all been given their independence.A. E.Geneva,W. D.
