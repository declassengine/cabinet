For Spender from Menzies and CaseyCabinet had a full discussion on the Indo-China questionyesterday and as a result Casey will leave for Geneva on Monday.    Hewill go by way of Delhi and Karachi and hopes to have some talks inLondon and Washington fairly soon.2. Cabinet does not underestimate the importance of the events in Indo-China to Australia.    Its consequences can be more serious for Australia than for any other Western nation.    We are also acutely aware that to some extent at any rate it is due to the Australian efforts over thelast few years that the United States has become impressed with theimportance of the South East Asian area and that to let the Americansfeel that we are not willing to pull our weight would be a very serious matter.    But we are troubled by the lack of precision that attaches tothe United States thinking - at any rate so far as their thinking is dis-closed to their friends.3. There are some who say that our destiny in the Pacific is sowrapped up with the United States that we should support them even ifwe believe the course of action proposed by them is wrong.4.        In the present circumstances this proposition would lead to theconclusion that we should agree to commit forces in Indo-China if theUnited States does so.-1
5.        Armed intervention at this stage would not be a United Nationsoperation but would be an act of war against the Communists.Australian participation in Korea had complete popular approval because it was a United Nations campaign.6.        What we are therefore being asked to accept is participation ina war from which quite clearly the United Kingdom, Canada, SouthAfrica and the rest of the British Commonwealth, except possibly NewZealand, are at present disposed to abstain.7.        This would be a completely impossible proposition for Australia to promote for it would be the first cleavage in Commonwealthunity.    Whatever may be said of the Indian attitude we can conceive ofnothing more destructive to Commonwealth unity than for Australia tobe neutral in a United Kingdom war or the United Kingdom neutral inan Australian war.8.        It is thus clear that tremendous efforts must be made tokeep United Kingdom and American policies in line.9.        The Americans have been extremely reticent about the objectives of intervention.    We cannot know either what liabilities weare accepting or measure our effective capacity to accept liabilityunless we know the military and political objectives of intervention.10.      If military objective is e.g. to prevent the Communists fromconquering the Hanoi area the ore must be reason for supposing that,having regard to the time-factor and forces that would be needed, the objective would be a realisable one.    Or is objective the completemilitary defeat of Vietminh Communists?    There is nothing to suggestthat this is feasible unless there is deep bombing of bases in Chinaitself.    That this would involve war with China is clear;  that it would provoke a general world war is certainly possible and may well beprobable.    It may well be said that all arguments which worked againstextended bombing beyond the borders of Korea are relevant here.    Soalso is the experience we have already had that intervention leadsultimately to some military Stal mate and ultimately either to some form of permanent garrison (which would be intolerable to local opinion) or an abandonment of the field.12.      The opinion of local inhabitants appears to us to have beeninsufficiently considered.13.      Paragraph 12 above is, of course, of first-class importancebecause to enter a country with armed forces against the will of the citizens of that country would be an act of invasion which might wellrally the whole of Asian opinion against us.    It is therefore important to aim for two things; first, the concurrence of India, Burma and otherAsian countries in a guarantee to Laos, Cambodia and the Southern partof Vietnam;  second, making it clear that such a guarantee was designedto support national integrity of definable countries, not to govern thembut to protect their independence.14.      It is only on such a footing as this that there would be any possibility of interesting Asian countries concerned.
16.      There is already partition in effect in Vietnam for insubstantial areas the Vietminh are in charge.   An agreed settlement which left the export rice bowl of Indo-China in the hands of Vietnamand which recognised the separate races and independence of Laos andCambodia would not only provide an effective opportunity to defendSouth East Asia against further Communist aggression but would also provide a real foundation for an international guarantee.17.      We feel confident that, if the United States can be induced to define its military and political objectives more clearly, it also willarrive at a conclusion along these lines.    We therefore believe thatour role should be to restrain the United States from embarking uponactive military intervention in Indo-China without adequate thought and definition of its objectives both military and political, and alsoto stimulate the United Kingdom to put forward greater efforts in theSouth East Asian area and in particular to be willing to guarantee an agreed settlement in Indo-China.18.      In short we are of the opinion that Australia&apos;s efforts shouldbe directed towards bringing about the following results (1) withdrawalof Vietminh forces from Laos and Cambodia, (2) a division of Vietnamon the best possible terms including denial of Mekong Delta toVietminh, (3) an international &quot;guarantee&quot; of the settlement with provision for enforcement of guarantee, (4) association of asian countries especially India, with settlement and guarantee, (5) a regionaldefensive arrangement within framework of United Nations both insupport of the settlement in Indo-China and with a more extensivepurpose.19.      As to the timing of a first meeting to discuss the possibilityof &quot;a collective defence&quot;, we have to take into account the timenecessary in which to endeavour to get adequate Asian participation in or sympathy towards the above-mentioned objectives.    The Asianattitude (and particularly India&apos;s) will depend upon their assessment of the effort of the British and the French and Americans to negotiate an agreement at Geneva.    Casey will discuss this question of timingwith other Governments, and our position is flexible.20.      Please give General Rowell a copy of this message.
