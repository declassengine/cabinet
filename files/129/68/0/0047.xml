(54) 19716th June, 1954CABINETTRIESTEMemorandum by the Minister of state on 12th April the Foreign Secretary circulated to the Cabinet a paper(C. (54) 145) regarding talks which have been taking place in London between representatives of the United Kingdom, United States and Yugoslavia with theobject of finding a realistic basis for bringing about an agreed settlement between italy and Yugoslavia of the Trieste problem. These talks were brought to a conclusion on 31st May, when an &quot;Agreed Record &quot; was initialled by the nego-tiators. This sets out the position reached at the end of the discussions and outlinesthe proposals which the United Kingdom and United States representatives have undertaken to put to the Italian Government as a basis for a settlement.2. A copy of the &quot; Agreed Record &quot; (without Annexes) is circulated herewithfor information. Its main provisions are:TerritorialZone A goes to Italy and Zone B to Yugoslavia. But there should be minor adjustments of the inter-zonal boundary resulting in an exchange of some 12 squarekilometres in the south-west corner of Zone A of the Free Territory against a somewhat smaller and less valuable strip in the north-east corner of Zone B.AdministrationSubject to agreement on all related points, the United Kingdom, United Statesand Yugoslav Governments should terminate the military governments in ZonesA and B of the Free Territory and the United Kingdom and United States Govern-ments, after withdrawal of their military forces from the area north of the newboundary, should relinquish administration of that area to the Italian Government.The Yugoslav and Italian Governments would forthwith extend their civiladministrations over the areas for which they would have responsibility.Safeguards for the Inhabitants of the Free Territory(a) The Yugoslav and Italian Governments should negotiate a statute on a reciprocal basis for the protection of the minorities in the areas which they wouldadminister.(b) The Italian Government should undertake to maintain the Free Port atTrieste in general accordance with the provisions of Articles 1-20 of Annex viii of the Italian Peace Treaty.(c) The Italian Government should be invited to declare that the area comingunder Italian administration would have an appropriate measure of local autonomy.Statement of Non-Support of Territorial ClaimsThe United Kingdom and United States Governments and, if they are willing,the French Government should issue a declaration that they will give no support to the claims of either Yugoslavia or Italy respecting territory under the sovereigntyor administration of the other.46289
Settlement of Outstanding Financial problems the United Kingdom and United States Governments would seek to bringabout, concurrently with the general agreement on Trieste, a lump-sum, or at least a partial, settlement of the principal financial problems now outstanding between italy and Yugoslavia and resulting in. the main from the Reparation Clause ofthe Italian Peace Treaty.3: In the course of the negotiations, the Yugoslav Government were informed,as authorised by the Cabinet on 13th April, that the United Kingdom Governmentwould contribute a sum of  2 millions as part of the final settlement of the dispute,probably in the form of an extension for one year of economic aid to Yugoslavia.4. It will be seen that the Yugoslav Government have now been brought toaccept, with certain modifications and safeguards, the solution which they rejectedand the Italians accepted last October. At the Foreign Secretary&apos;s direction, the proposition was communicated to the Italian Government on 1st June. It is difficultto forecast what their reaction will be. The proposition will involve some sacrificeon their part, as it has on the part of the Yugoslavs. But, in my opinion, they willbe well-advised to close quickly with an offer which gives them far the mostimportant part of the Free Territory and which may not easily be repeated.m   % :   - - s. l.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,12th June, 1954AGREED RECORD OF POSITIONS REACHED AT THE CONCLUSIONOF DISCUSSIONS IN LONDON, 2nd FEBRUARY TO 31st MAY,BETWEEN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED KINGDOM,UNITED STATES AND YUGOSLAVIABeginning on 2nd February, 1954, a series of discussions took place in Londonbetween representatives of the United Kingdom, United States and YugoslavGovernments in order to ascertain whether a basis for the solution of the Triesteproblem could be found which would be acceptable to both Yugoslavia and Italy.A common desire for the solution of the problem was manifest during these discussions. The Yugoslav representative made it clear that, should agreementnot be reached as a result of the current negotiations, the Yugoslav Governmentwould not consider itself bound by the provisions of this record.1. procedure United Kingdom and United States representatives undertook to proposeto the Italian Government that it enter into a Memorandum of Understandingcovering points 2 to 6 below and any points suggested by the Italian Government,or any other participants, upon which agreement is reached. Such a memorandum would make reference to the present unsatisfactory situation resulting from the impossibility of putting into effect the provisions of the Italian Peace Treatyrelating to the Free Territory of Trieste and to the agreement of the UnitedKingdom, United States, Yugoslavia and Italy, as the countries principally con-cerned, to bring this situation to an end. It would provide that, as soon as theMemorandum has been initialled and the territorial adjustments described thereinhave been carried out, the United Kingdom, United States and Yugoslav Govern-ments will terminate the Military Governments in Zones A and B of the Territory,and the United Kingdom and United States Governments will withdraw their military forces from the area north of the new boundary and relinquish adminis-tration of that area to the Italian Government. The Yugoslav and Italian Govern-ments will forthwith extend their civil administrations over the areas for whichthey have responsibility.The Memorandum of Understanding will be notified to the parties to theItalian Peace Treaty and to the Security Council of the United Nations.
2. Territorial Provisions &apos;It was agreed that the United Kingdom and United States representatives will propose to the Italian Government the acceptance of the territorial delimitationdescribed in Annex I. The new boundary will be drawn on a map at a scale of1: 50,000, which will be annexed to the Memorandum of Understanding. As soonas the Memorandum of Understanding has been initialled,&apos; representatives ofAllied Military. Government and representatives of Yugoslav Military Govern-ment will carry out promptly, and in any event within three weeks, a provisionaladjustment of the boundary in accordance with the map. The Memorandum of understanding will include a provision for the subsequent establishment by the yugoslav and Italian Governments of a commission to effect a definitive demarcation-tion of the boundary in accordance with the map.3. MinoritiesIt was agreed that there should be annexed to the Memorandum of Under-standing a statute on a reciprocal basis for the protection of the Minoritiesin the areas concerned. The United Kingdom and United States representativesundertook to transmit to the Italian Government a set of guiding principles,prepared by the Yugoslav representative and attached hereto as Annex II, whichshould, subject to consideration of any Italian suggestions, serve as the basis forthe preparation of such a Statute.4. Free PortIt was agreed that the Memorandum of Understanding should contain anundertaking by the Italian Government to maintain the Free Port at Trieste ingeneral accordance with the provisions of Articles 1 through 20 of Annex viii of the Italian Peace Treaty.The United Kingdom and United States representatives will propose that theItalian Government agree to invite representatives of Yugoslavia, Austria andpossibly other users of the Port of Trieste to a meeting for the purpose of working out the necessary arrangements to apply these articles under present conditionsin order to ensure the fullest possible use of the Free Port in accordance withthe needs of international trade. It was agreed that the Italian Government could give its undertaking to call such a meeting in a confidential exchange of letterswith the Yugoslav Government simultaneously with the initialling of theMemorandum of Understanding.5. AutonomyIt was agreed that the United Kingdom and United States representatives should endeavour to obtain inclusion in the Memorandum of Understanding ofa declaration by the Italian Government that the area coming under Italianadministration should have an appropriate measure of local autonomy.6. Non-Prosecution clause the United Kingdom and United States representatives will propose theinclusion in the Memorandum of Understanding of a statement along the following lines:  &quot; The Governments of Yugoslavia and Italy agree that they will not undertake any legal or administrative action to prosecute or discriminate against any resident of the areas, coming under their civil administrations inaccordance with the Memorandum of Understanding, for past political activities in connexion with the solution of the problem of the Free territory of Trieste.&quot;7. Consular Representation in Trieste; The United Kingdom and United States representatives will propose that theItalian Government undertake to accord consular status to the representatives ofthe countries now represented in Trieste by political or commercial representatives.8. Slovene Credit and Cultural InstitutionsThe United Kingdom and United States representatives undertook to seekItalian acquiescence in the granting by Allied Military Government in Zone of permission for the opening of a Slovene credit institution in Trieste.  Allied
Military Government may take such action before the Memorandum of Under-standing is initialled.The United Kingdom and United States representatives also undertook to explore with the Italian Government the possibility of making arrangements toprovide suitable buildings for the cultural activities of the Slovene minority in thearea of Trieste as a partial replacement for those formerly used for this purpose.9. Question of ClaimsThe Yugoslav representative stated that his Government did not wish to raisethe question of option, claims and counter-claims arising out of the execution ofthe provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding. Should, however, theItalian Government press for a provision on this point, the Yugoslav view is thatthe inhabitants of the Free Territory should be given one year in which to decide whether they wish to change residence and one additional year in which to dispose of property. The sums realised from such property liquidation would be depositedin special accounts with the national banks of the two countries and any balance between these two accounts would be liquidated by the two Governments withina specified period of time.10. Settlement of Financial problems the United Kingdom and United States representatives undertook to makestrong efforts to bring about, concurrently with the general agreement on Trieste,a lump-sum settlement, or at least a partial settlement, of the principal financial problems now outstanding between Italy and Yugoslavia.The Yugoslav representative maintained that a settlement or partial settle-ment of these problems should be arrived at concurrently with the general settlement of the Trieste problem. The United Kingdom and United States repre-sentatives, while agreeing to make every effort to obtain a settlement, maintained their position that the resolution of the Trieste question should not be madeabsolutely contingent thereon. The Yugoslav representative also considered thatsuch settlement should dispose of the claims arising from the Reparation pro-visions of the Italian Peace Treaty and the Italo-Yugoslav agreements signed in belgrade on 23rd May, 1949, and in Rome on 23rd December, 1950. He did notconsider that claims arising out of the Memorandum of Understanding should beincluded in such a settlement.11. Statement of Non-Support of Territorial ClaimsAfter the Memorandum of Understanding has been initialled, the UnitedKingdom and United States Governments will issue a Declaration that they willgive no support to the claims of either Yugoslavia or Italy respecting territory under the sovereignty or administration of the other. The United Kingdom and united States Governments will invite the French Government to make a similardeclaration.(GEOFFREY W. HARRISON.)(LLEWELLYN  E.  THOMPSON.)(VLADIMIR L.
