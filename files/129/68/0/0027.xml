Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1954SECRET cabinet OFFICE Copy No. fi?- record copy  (54) 17724th May, 1954CABINETTHE GENEVA conference memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsObjectivesOur objectives are:  (a) Positively. To give the Geneva Conference a chance of success withoutdoing grave damage to Anglo-United States relations.(b) Negatively. Not to lose the chance of making defensive arrangements with the United States for South-East Asia at the proper stage.Difficulties2. The main difficulty is that the United States Government may want to&quot; go ahead &quot; without the United Kingdom unless we are prepared to follow theirlead. By going ahead they have so far in mind (i) intervention in Indo-China;(ii) a South-East Asia Defence Pact (S.E.A.T.O.);fiii) an appeal by Siam (and perhaps by Cambodia and Laos) to the united nations for peace observation teams to be sent out.Risks3. (i) A decision to intervene in Indo-China depends on the French answers to the United States questions. It is most unlikely that the present FrenchGovernment, which is only there on sufferance, will agree to continued, let aloneincreased, effort in Indo-China. This risk is therefore not great. In any event we are not the obstacle; we only ask to be kept informed. It is possible, althoughour Military Attache in Paris thinks it unlikely, that the French will suffer furthermilitary disaster in the Delta within the next week or two. If so, this is more likely to lead to a French decision to evacuate and the fall of the present government than to an acceptance by the present Government of the conditions for American intervention.(ii) Until the outcome of Geneva is clearer, a South-East Asia Defence Pactcould be spoiled by premature action by the United States Government to fixmembership and determine the scope. We should try to hold the United Statesback by persuading them to start with Five-Power Staff Talks and by showingour readiness for speed and to high-level representation (e.g., general sir G. Templer).(iii) The Siamese appeal for peace observation teams would be unwise but, ifit becomes necessary to demonstrate that we are not dragging our feet, it is a concession that we could perhaps make in order to obtain our way over (ii), whichis cardinal. In any event we could not prevent Siam appealing to the united nations if she wished. It is, however, important to stop Laos and Cambodia from doing so until we see the outcome at Geneva.Conclusion4. The risks to our double objectives are not unduly great, provided we can obtain two to three weeks&apos; grace.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,25th May, 1954.46206
