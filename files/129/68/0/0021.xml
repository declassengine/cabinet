(54) 17121st May, 1954CABINETOPENCAST coal memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister,ofAgriculture and Fisheries, . We, recognise the difficulties of coal supply to which the Minister of fuel and Power draws attention in C. (54) 163. But we do not consider that theyoutweigh the agricultural objections to his proposal that there should be no furtherban on opencast working at the present time.2. Farmers have had to endure opencast mining since 1941. They loyallyaccepted it as a war-time expedient. But now, nine years after the end of the war,they are becoming more and more hostile to its continuation. At their last AnnualGeneral Meeting, the National Farmers&apos; Union of England and Wales passed bya large majority a resolution strongly opposing opencast working on good land.3. We recognise, however, that opencast production must continue duringthe next few years, and that a high proportion of the land to be worked will be good agricultural land. This will be difficult enough to justify to the farmers.But if our best land is now taken, the confidence of the farming industry will be seriously shaken. The Minister of Fuel and Power proposes that more than 1,000acres of first-class land should be taken in Lancashire alone during the next threeyears. Such a programme would in our view be incompatible with our agricultural policy of maintaining food production while securing lower unit costs of production.4.  We feel bound therefore to press for:A. A ban on the working of all first-class land in Great Britain as classifiedunder the Land Utilisation Survey.(i) This would involve a direct loss of about \\ million tons ofcoal over the next three years (about 150,000 tons in 1954 rising to700,000 tons in 1956).(ii) The whole of this loss would be in Lancashire. We appreciate that the coal supply position in this county is difficult and that about half its total requirements have to be brought in by rail from otherparts of the country.B. Acceptance of the principle that sympathetic consideration will be given tothe exemption from opencast working of a small amount of the best landnot classified as first-class in the Survey.(i) This is no more than a necessary corollary to A above. TheLand Utilisation Survey is on too large a scale to be entirely accurate asregards small areas. It would be difficult to defend a policy whichexempted land in East Lothian and Lancashire but allowed opencastworking on land of broadly comparable quality in, for example, theEast Neuk of Fife, Northumberland and Flintshire. The existing banon working in East Lothian is based not upon reference to the Survey(which does not show the whole of the banned area to consist of highest-class land) but upon a field-by-field assessment by technical officers.46192
(ii) It could be left to us to raise with the Minister of FuelandPower any individual cases of outstanding agricultural importance which merit sympathetic consideration on this basis. Such cases would-.................   naturally have to be considered not only on their agricultural meritsbut also in relation to available coal supplies. But we are convincedthat, if the Minister of Fuel and Power were able to agree to the exemption of some of the most important agricultural sites in areasother than East Lothian and Lancashire during the next year or two, itwould make it a good deal easier to reconcile farming opinion to thecontinuance of opencast production on good land. .5. Even with restrictions as proposed under A and B the opencast programme will still include much really good land. In view of the difficulties of coal supply,we are prepared to stand up to the inevitable criticisms from the farmers.6. We think it is desirable that there should be an early announcement of theGovernment^ policy on this question.conclusion. We ask our colleagues to agree that there will in future be restrictions onthe working of the best agricultural land in Great Britain on the basis indicated inparagraph 4.J.S.T. L. D.21st May, 1954.
