IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GO YERNMENT)SECRET- CABINET office.(54) 164 RECOhD COPY17th May, 1954CABINETBRITISH HONDURASMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the People&apos;s United Party (P. U. P. ) have gained an overwhelmingvictory in the elections held on 28th April, and won 8 out of the 9 seats.There was a very high poll, averaging over 70 per cent of the electorate,and the P. U. P. won 64 per cent of the votes cast.    The P. U. P. thus havea majority of one in the Legislative Assembly, which will consist of anominated Speaker (who has neither an original nor a casting vote),3 officials, 3 nominated unofficials and 9 elected members.2.        We have now to consider whether to go on with the second stage of the constitutional plan.     This involves the re constitution of theGovernor^ Executive Council, so that it will consist of 3 ex-officiomembers and 6 members elected by the Legislative Assembly - 4 from among the elected and 2 from among the nominated members.     (Thismeans that 4 P. U. P. members will be elected to the Executive Council. )The Executive Council will become the principal instrument of policy andthe Governor will be required, except in an emergency, to act in accordancewith its advice.     The elected members, however, will not be designatedMinisters or be given administrative charge of Government Departments.3.        The Governor proposes to appoint as nominated members of theLegislative Assembly 3 substantial citizens who can be relied upon to oppose any extreme measures sponsored by the P. U. P.    Of these, 2 willhave to be elected to the Executive Council and these members may beexpected to vote with the 3 officials on any crucial issue.    This will place the P. U. P. in a minority of one, and even if through illness or some othercause the voting was even the Governor as Chairman still retains acasting vote.    It should thus be possible to carry on day-to-day administration without yielding to P. U. P. pressure and without recourse to the use of the Governor&apos;s reserve powers in the Executive Council.4.        I consider that the P. U. P. members can do relatively little harmin the Executive Council.    Their presence there gives some chance,though it does not guarantee, that Government measures will be acceptedby the Legislative Assembly without the Constant use of the Governor&apos;sreserve powers.    I do not think that we can very well deny the promisedre constitution of the Executive Council.    To do so would precipitatean immediate crisis and we should be open to criticism for not havinggiven the P. U. P. a chance to co-operate.      The Governor stronglyargues that v/e should go ahead as planned, and I agree.    I consider,however, that:-COPY NO.&apos;-1
ft(a) The P. U. P. leaders must first give definite and satisfactory assurances &quot;that they are preparedto co-operate in working the constitution.    TheGovernor is confident that these assurances willbe forthcoming.(b) Representatives of the unofficial members of theExecutive Council (not exclusively of the P. U. P.members) should be invited to visit London soon,accompanied by the Governor if he thinks thisdesirable for talks on the future progress anddevelopment of the Colony.     This would give anopportunity of testing the willingness of theP. U, P. to co-operate and of reinforcing theGovernor&apos;s efforts to win them over to a responsible attitude.5.        It is possible, perhaps even probable, that sooner or later theP. U. P. leaders will prove intransigent and that the constitution will breakdown.    If that is so, and it becomes necessary to take action to substitutesome other form of constitutional machinery, we shall be on strong groundto face criticism, having given the P. U. P. a fair chance to co-operate.6.        British Honduras is a country the size of Wales with a populationof only 70,000.    The real problem of the Colony is its economic develop-ment.    I feel that the political situation has been unduly played up in thePress, and we should try to put it in its true perspective.7.        I recommend that subject to receiving the assurances referred toin paragraph 4(a) I should announce in the House of Commons that the planned second stage of the constitution will go ahead.O. L.Colonial Office, S. W. 1.15th May, 1954.-Z
