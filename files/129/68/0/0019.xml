secret cabinet office record copy .(54) 169COPY NO19th May, 1954CABINETTOGOLAND UNDER UNITED KINGDOM TRUSTEESHIPMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesTogoland under United Kingdom Trusteeship is a narrowlandlocked strip of territory on the eastern border of the Gold Coast witha population of about 400,000.    Since it came under British control in1914 it has been administered as an integral part of the Gold Coast;this arrangement now rests on Article 5 of the Trusteeship agreement which reaffirms the provision in the earlier League of Nations Mandatethat the Administering Authority shall administer the territory inaccordance with his own laws as an integral part of his territory.    by virtue of this arrangement the Trust Territory has fully shared theconstitutional and political progress of the Gold Coast.2. On 28th April the Minister of State for Colonial affairs informed Parliament of the constitutional changes in the Gold Coastapproved by the Cabinet on 16th September, 1953 (C0C.(53) 52ndConclusions, Minute 3) and made the declaration about the grant to theGold Coast at the appropriate time of self-government within theCommonwealth agreed by the Committee on Commonwealth Membershipon 23rd September, 1953.3. The new Gold Coast constitution formally preserves theresponsibility of the United Kingdom Government as the administering authority for Togoland.    It makes the Governor responsible in his discretion for Togoland and provides that any functions relating toTogoland exercised by Gold Coast Mlinisters shall be subject to theGovernor&apos;s directions.4. When self-government is granted to the Gold Coast it willbecome impossible for the United Kingdom Government to discharge their responsibilities under the present Trusteeship Agreement forTogoland.     To do so, they would need to take special measures toexercise in Togoland an authority separate from that of the Gold coast government.    After 40 years of common administration Gold Coast andTogoland affairs are so closely mingled that the separate administrationof this inland territory would be against both the interests and, almost certainly, also the wishes of its peoples.     It would create an administration which could not effectively administer the territory andwould therefore destroy the hope of any further progress in realisingthe aims of the Trusteeship System.5. Since the Gold Coast constitution of 1951 the United nations have drawn increasing attention to the sharp difference between theoryand practice in responsibility for the administration of Togoland.    Whenthe time comes to fulfil the promise of self-government for the gold coast, it will be necessary either to revise or to terminate the
Trusteeship Agreement for Togoland.    As the Gold Coast is likely to look for self-government within the next two to four years, and as theUnited Nations will probably require about two years to reach a final conclusion on the future of Togoland, we must start considering nowwhat that future should be.6. Togoland under United Kingdom Trusteeship cannot standalone.     It is too small and poor and it has close economic and ethnicties west and east with neighbouring territories.    Its Northern section is peopled by the same tribes as the Northern Territories of the gold coast with which it is wholly assimilated.    The only possible future for the Northern Section is integration with a self-governing Gold Coast.7. The position in the Southern Section is more complicated.Out of a population of over 220,000 nearly 150,000 belong to the Ewetribe.    About 400,000 Ewes live in the south-eastern corner of the gold coast Colony and a slightly larger number  in the southern part ofTogoland under French Trusteeship.    The Ewes have no close tribalsystem and during the inter-war years there was easy communication between the two mandates.    The economic difficulties of the war and the boundary restrictions imposed when French Togoland came under VichyFrance awoke a political demand for Ewe unity which has been apersistent embarrassment to the French and ourselves in the united nations.     The demand has sometimes been for the unification of Britishand French Togolands and sometimes for the creation of an Ewe Stateincluding the Ewe speaking part of the Gold Coast.8. Unification of the two Togolands would solve nothing.   the tribes of the Northern Section of British Togoland would be artificiallycut off from their kinsmen in the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast:the Ewes in the Southern Section would be united with those in FrenchTogoland, but cut off from those in the Gold Coast.    The creation of anEwe State might meet the emotional demand for Ewe unity but it would be unacceptable both to France and to the Gold Coast, which would lose alarge slice of Gold Coast territory.    It would also rule out the VoltaRiver Hydro-Electric Scheme.9. We have had no sure means of gauging the strength of thedemand for Ewe unity in the Southern Section of British Togoland, whichprobably has substantial minority support, but the rapid advance of theGold Coast towards self-government has won much Ewe sympathy and Ewespokesmen have frequently declared their aim to be Ewe unity within, or as a partner with, a self-governing Gold Coast.     The French well know that Ewe sentiment is directed against them rather than against us and wehave often had to go to great lengths to reassure them that the UnitedKingdom is not encouraging Ewe intransigence as a means of obtainingauthority over French Togoland.10. After the long association of British Togoland with the gold coast the Gold Coast Government look for its integration with the gold coast when the Trusteeship Agreement is terminated.    United Kingdomsupport for this Gold Coast attitude was pledged in June, 1951 in aprivate talk in London between the then Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State for the Colonies, Mr. T. Cook, and Dr. Nkrumah.     Gold CoastMinisters realise that there must be clear majority support in Togolandfor integration before the United Nations will agree to it.    They have therefore made it a major issue in the General Election to be held underthe new constitution on 15th June, which will be the first real trial of strength between the Government party and the all-Ewe movement.
11. Article 76(b) of the United Nations Charter says that a basicobjective of the Trusteeship system-is to promote.....&quot;the progressive development (of the Trust Territories) towards self-government orindependence as may be appropriate to the particular circumstances ofeach territory and its peoples and the freely expressed wishes of thepeople concerned&quot;.    Integration with the Gold Coast is the onlysatisfactory objective for British Togoland in its particular circumstances.It would continue undisturbed the administrative arrangements of the last40 years, it would, I believe, meet the wishes of a majority, probably asubstantial majority, of the whole population, it would fulfil the reason-able expectation of the Gold Coast Government and it would be welcomed by the French.     It would not prevent a future self-governing Gold Coastfrom seeking to draw the Ewes of French Togoland into its orbit but itwould help France to deal direct with the Gold Coast over this issuewithout the intervention of the United Nations on behalf of BritishTogoland.   Clearly the inhabitants must be consulted before a decision is reached between the United Nations and the Administering Authority,but with the north solid for integration and sentiment in the southincreasingly tending that way, majority opinion is not in serious doubt.Our tactics will however depend to some extent on the results of theGeneral Election.12. I therefore propose that the United Kingdom Governmentshould:-(a) Inform the United Nations that, as, under the trusteeship Agreement, British Togoland has been administered as an integral part of the Gold Coast,other arrangements for its administration must bemade when the Gold Coast becomes self-governing;(b) inform the United Nations that British Togoland,owing to its situation and resources, could not be administered as a separate Trust Territory withoutgreat hardship to its inhabitants, or with any prospectof realising the aims of the Trusteeship system, so thatit would not then be possible for the United KingdomGovernment to continue responsible for its administration;(c) inform the United Nations of the view of the UnitedKingdom Government that when the Gold Coast becomesself-governing the basic objectives of the Charter inrespect of British Togoland would best be fulfilled by itsintegration with the Gold Coast, which would involvetermination of its trusteeship status;(d) invite the United Nations to consider future arrangements for British Togoland, and before reachingconclusions, to ascertain the wishes of its inhabitants by whatever method seems most satisfactory, including ifnecessary the holding of a plebiscite.13. Before they were communicated to the United Nations theUnited Kingdom proposals would first be discussed with the French aspart of the routine Anglo-French exchanges on Colonial questions of mutual concern.    Some Member States, while in favour of integration,may wish to press for a plebiscite to bring French Togoland also intothe Gold Coast or may wish to defer integration until the future of
French Togo-land is also to be decided.    To achieve this they maypropose either Gold Coast trusteeship or joint United Kingdom/Gold Coasttrusteeship of British Togoland for a further limited period.    If thisoccurs we must reaffirm our intention to terminate the trusteeship whenthe Gold Coast becomes self-governing and persuade the Gold Coast to reply to any United Nations enquiries that they similarly expect adecision on integration forthwith.    We must discuss these various possibilities with the French.14. Finally certain Commonwealth Governments, otherAdministering Authorities (including the United States) and some other friendly Member States would be informed of the United Kingdomproposals shortly before these were sent to the United Nations and astatement would be made in Parliament.15. It may be that the United Nations, while agreeing to the integration of British Togoland with the Gold Coast, will propose that,because of the inexperience of the Gold Coast Government, thatGovernment should continue to report to the United Nations on Togolandfor a limited period.     If this is proposed, the United Kingdom Delegationwould work for its rejection.16. I invite my colleagues to approve the action proposed inparagraphs 12 to 15.    I am confident that our proposals will be acceptable to the United Nations and will ultimately result in the integration ofBritish Togoland with the Gold.Coast.     But should unforeseen obstacles to integration arise, I will consult my colleagues again..17. The Minister of State has seen this paper and agrees with it.O.L.Colonial Office, S.W.1.18th May, 1954.
