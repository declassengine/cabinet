OIL-FIRING AT MARCHWOOD POWER STATIONNote by the Minister of Fuid and power have examined with the Minister of Housing the question ofatmospheric pollution at Southampton which is referred to in paragraph 17of C. (54) 163, and I attach an agreed statement of the relevant facts andarguments.There is inevitably a large margin of uncertainty incalculations such as these.     I think that the best course is to augmentthe existing measurements of atmospheric pollution in Southampton sothat, when the new station starts, its effect can be accurately assessed.This is being done.    As the station is to be dual-fired, it could be changed over to coal-firing if it proves necessary during the periodswhen the pollution is shown to be serious.G.L.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W.1.31st May, 1954.Atmospheric Pollution from Oil-firing at MarchwoodOil-firing was originally suggested at the Marchwood power station as a means of avoiding grit on Southampton.    This proposal was dropped and the station is being fitted with the most modern grit-arrestingplant which, though efficient, does not completely prevent the dischargeof some grit when coal is burnt.    In the meanwhile, for reasons ofnational policy, it has been proposed that the station be equipped for alternative oil or coal firing, and the effect of burning oil on the atmosphere of Southampton has to be examined.    The oil fuel availablecontains about three times as much sulphur as the coal, and when allowance is made for its greater calorific value will throw out abouttwice as much sulphur dioxide.2, Measurements of sulphur dioxide pollution in a large city suchas London show that the average in winter is between O. 1 and O. 2 partsper million.    The maximum value recorded during the &quot;smog&quot; of 1952was between 1 and 2 parts per million, but this was accompanied bysevere climatic conditions and a high smoke content.    The relativeeffect on health of sulphur dioxide and other pollutants, and of climate conditions, is at present unknown.(fHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL CABIN FT  OFFICERECUi-O :J0PY ft&apos;C.(54) 186 COPY NO.

3. Calculations which will give an indication of the order of maximum concentration of sulphur dioxide for a particular power stationcan also be made, and these indicate that with Marchwood power stationgiving its full output on oil and a wind speed of eight miles an hour amaximum concentration of 2 parts per million from this source might beexpected to occur in a zone 3 miles down wind.    The centre ofSouthampton is 3 miles from Marchwood in a north easterly direction.4. It has, however, not yet been possible directly to relate thesetwo sets of figures arrived at in such different ways.    The London figures are daily averages of actual pollution measured at particular spots.The Marchwood figures are estimates of pollution from a single sourcereaching a particular area and assuming absolutely steady conditions.There are so many variables that any attempt to translate the latterinto measurable daily averages of pollution to be expected at any place would have to be mainly guesswork.5. About 35 per cent of the winds in this area have speeds of between 7 and 12 miles an hour.    About 26 per cent of the winds lie between south-south-west and west-south-west, hence about 11 per cent of winds satisfy the conditions necessary to establish the maximumaverage concentration of the order of 2 parts per million in a zone acrossthe middle of Southampton.    These calculations do not cover the case ofa major temperature inversion but, because of the height of the chimney(425 ft. ), it is possible that in these circumstances the pollution from thepower station would not be as severe in the city itself.6. Reductions in load would reduce the quantity of the gasescoming out of the chimney and so reduce the maximum concentrationnear ground level in Southampton.    The planned load factor of theMarchwood power station will drop during its life from 45 per cent to35 per cent, which reduces the possibility of the maximum emission ofsulphur dioxide coinciding with the meteorological conditions likely to cause maximum concentration in the middle of the town.7. It is not possible to say definitely whether or not the oil-firing at Marchwood would produce sulphur dioxide concentrations overappreciable periods in Southampton as great or greater than the maximumrecorded during the London &quot;smog&quot; of 1952, but it is possible that therewould be brief periods when the concentrations would be as high as theaverage in London during the 1952 &quot;smog&quot;.    The only way in which more definite answers could be obtained to the questions that arise would befor measurements of the existing sulphur dioxide concentration inSouthampton to be intensified, for the power station to start burning oil,and for detailed comparison of actual concentrations to be made.    Itmight be possible to experiment further by comparing periods duringwhich the power station burned coal with periods during which it burnedoil.    If it were found that during certain meteorological conditions oil-burning produced undesirably high concentrations, arrangements mightbe made to burn coal at such times.
