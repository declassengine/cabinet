EXPENSES OF MEMBERSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer it has been suggested by some of my colleagues that we should introduce now a plan of subsistence allowances for M.Ps. , that we should say that we accept in principle the decision of the House as expressed inthe free vote, but that we should not implement that decision until thenext Parliament.2.        I do not like putting off the implementation of the decision to thenext Parliament since I am most keen to prevent this matter being raised in the election.    If it were put forward to the next Parliament I cannot helpfeeling that Members would make all sorts of extravagant statements about their own and other people&apos;s intentions during the election.    I have feltthroughout that Parliament should settle its own affairs without tying them up with the claims of others.    My own proposal is set out in the nextsection - &quot;The Plan&quot;.3.        I greatly prefer a block grant for expenses to so-called subsistenceallowances.     The block grant drawn monthly would appeal more to thedignity and convenience of Hon. Members.    a genuine subsistence allowance scheme is bound to be complicated:  if the same allowances are given to all,although their subsistence expenses are widely different, they cannot be described as a subsistence allowance.4.        It is an error to suppose that any system of allowances in respectof expenses (whether called subsistence allowances or by any other title)will improve the financial position of Members by the gross amount ofthose allowances.    The allowances must be deducted from the amount which Members would claim for relief from income tax on their salaries.Otherwise Members would in fact be receiving two benefits in respect ofa single set of expenses, namely cash reimbursement and tax relief.    Thisis indefensible and contrary to the Income Tax Law.     I explained this to theHouse in my speech on 13th May (Hansard, Column 1496, last paragraphand Column 1497, first three paragraphs).5.        If we are not to go forward with a straight salary increase of  500the plan below is the best I can think of.vThe Plan6.        The Government would announce that they accept in principle thedecision of the House as recorded on free vote on 24th May.    They would say that, under present circumstances, they could not implement thisdecision forthwith in the manner proposed.    They propose, therefore, to-1* secret cabinet office record copy .(54) 192 copy no.4th June, 1954CABEvTET
divide the extra financial provision for M. Ps. into two parts - (i) a modestsalary increase, and (ii) a monthly reimbursement of expenses.    the salary increase would come into force in the next financial year;  thereimbursement scheme would come into force at once or, if preferred,from the beginning of this present financial year.7.        The salary increase should be from  1,000 to  1,250 only (thistakes account of the Governments statements that they do not wish toaccept the findings of the Select Committee or to relate the level ofM. Ps. salary to the 1946 cost of living).8.        In addition each M. P. may draw monthly in cash a reimbursement of expenses at the rate of  250 a year on the basis of a simple certificatethat his expenses are not less than this.     (If, exceptionally, expenses were less he would draw the lower figure;   in fact there are only 14 M.Ps. atpresent, out of the total House of over 600, who claim tax relief for expenses at less than this figure. )9.        Expenses over  250 would continue to be claimable for tax reliefagainst the present salary in the interim period and the salary of  1,250in the next financial year.     The  250 expenses claimed in each would bedeductible from the total expenses in arriving at the tax relief due.R. A. B.Treasury Chambers, S. W.l.4th June, 1954.
