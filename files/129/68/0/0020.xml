Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1954SECRETcabinet office record copy copy No.C. (54) 17020th May, 1954CABINETFUEL policy memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer am entirely at one with the Minister of Fuel and Power as to the seriousness of the situation, but I have doubts about the means he proposes to employ, both as to their adequacy and their justification. I sum up my views in paragraph 16below.2. The proposals in the Minister of Fuel and Power&apos;s paper (C. (54) 163)amount to a release of 3% million tons of good coal by importing and substituting1 - 9 million tons of fuel oil.   To do this:  (a) some gas works are to instal oil-burning instead of coal-burning plants to save \ million tons of large coal;(b) the railways are to substitute briquettes for 3 million tons of large coal.To make briquettes the National Coal Board (N.C.B.) is to be directed,against its commercial judgment, to instal briquetting plant (capital investment  5^ millions), which it is admitted will stand a good chanceof being obsolescent within a few years of its installation and product of which will, in any event, have to be heavily subsidised (30s. per ton)by the coal industry to make the briquettes competitive in price;(c) but, as there is no spare small coal to feed the briquetting plants, the british electricity Authority (B.E.A.) is to be persuaded to instal dual firingat some of its stations at a capital cost of  5- 6 millions and anoperating loss of up to 30,s. to 35s. per ton of coal released;(d) to enable the process to start we are to import nearly 2 million extra tonsof fuel oil which might cost  6 millions in dollars.3. These proposals are not in tune with the economic policies which we arefollowing with success in other fields. In contrast to our general policies offreeing markets, we are still holding down the price of coal to a level which does not reflect either its marginal cost or its scarcity. We are not making proper use ofthe price mechanism.4. The Minister of Fuel and Power wishes to give directions to the B.E.A.and the N.C.B. to undertake additional investment and to follow policies whichare against their commercial judgment and will involve them in losses. He is onlyable to operate these uneconomic controls because the industries are nationalised.But one of our strongest arguments against nationalisation has been that it would lead to just this type of undesirable interference by the Government. Such action can hardly redound to our credit, particularly as the savings of coal that will finallyresult will be comparatively small.5. Nevertheless, the situation is so serious that I realise that some unorthodoxmethods may have to be used. I am therefore prepared to accept those proposalsof the Minister of Fuel and Power which do not clearly involve heavy commerciallosses: the gas industry should be encouraged to press on with the use of oil; andthe B.E.A. should be encouraged to convert the Marchwood power station to oilburning. These two proposals would eventually save a total of \\ million tons ofcoal a year. The remaining proposals for converting power stations to oil and forforcing the N.C.B. to produce briquettes are so uneconomic that I think we mustreject them.46178
2Prices   j ,t 1 &apos; ^ ,    &quot;r 1    V &apos; &apos; &apos;6. Our recent decision to widen the price differentials was a step in the right direction, and I suggest that we should be prepared to carry this policy further. Asto consumption, it will be generally accepted that price increases in general makeusers imore careful; indeed we expect the recent changes in relative coal prices to alter demand from dearer to cheaper coal. There is plenty of evidence that coalis used wastefully and uneconomically on a very large scale indeed, and it wouldbe contrary to all experience to suppose that price changes would riot help. TheCoal Board furthermore works a number of mines at a substantial loss, and aprivate industry in similar circumstances would feel impelled to put up the price.7. I understand the political difficulty of moving too fast and far in thisdirection, but the trouble is that, unless and until we make more use of the pricemechanism, our difficulties on coal do not look like being cured. In particular Ido not see how there can be any question of abolishing rationing until we areprepared to see prices go up to the point of holding a balance between supplyand demand. I fully share the Minister^ wish to abolish this last major systemof rationing. But rationing is the accompaniment of prices which are keptartificially low. Although we are getting rid of food rationing, we are at the sametime letting prices find their proper level&apos;; we do not get rid of it by uneconomicinterference.   . .Production8. I am in complete agreement with the Minister of Fuel that we must con-tinue to press for better leadership and more capital investment in the mines, but thatit would not be realistic to hope for very quick results from either, disappointingthough the gains have been so far. On man-power, however, I think that he isunduly cautious when he says that &quot; we cannot nowadays count on getting a net increase of more than a few thousand miners in any year.&quot; I think that we mustmaintain a continuous and energetic recruiting drive until we have at least gotback to the figure of 720,000 wage earners on the colliery books, reached in 1949,1952 and 1953, and I propose that this should be our immediate target.Fuel Economy9. I do not agree with the proposal to force the N.C.B. to subsidise briquetteconsumption by the railways. The better way to coal saving by the railways wouldbe by extending electrifications, as this actually saves coal, rather than transferring the demand from one type to another. I therefore suggest that Sir Brian Robertson,the Chairman of the British Transport Commission, should be urged to expediteand enlarge railway electrification plans. The immediate contribution to the coal situation would not be large, but it would be an increasing one and the test shouldbe that the investment is fully justifiable on commercial grounds in the long run.10. In industry there is great scope for further fuel saving. The ProductivityTeam on Fuel Conservation, in their recent report, estimated that 30 million tonsof coal could be saved each year without impairing any services; and, more par-ticularly, that the efficiency of industrial steam-raising plant could be raised by10 per cent, by known means in the short term, saving between 5 and 10 million tons of coal a year. Investment expenditure would be involved; but such expendi-ture would be much more profitable, both from the point of view of coal savingand commercially, than the investment expenditure involved in the Minister^proposals.11. Why then is there not more investment in fuel saving equipment? Itis partly because of our price policy; if prices were higher, there would be morefuel saving. Taxation of industry is always put forward as a disincentive and i hope that the new system of investment allowances will be helpful on this aspect.But in many cases one must conclude that it is also due to inertia or inefficientmanagement. Financial resources should not be in question here because the first instalment of industrial loans for fuel saving, made available by the Governmenton commercial terms, has not been taken up. However, I was impressed by thecase made out by the Minister of Fuel and Power that comparatively smalladditional capital investment could result in significant savings of coal at no long-term cost to the firms concerned, and in most cases at a considerable profit in ashort period. Since firms, for whatever reason, have not shown themselves willingto take up these loans (and I think we should have some explanation, for the
apparent failure of the existing loans scheme), I suggest that the Ministry of fuel and Power should consider: what means there are to induce firms which continue touse fuel wastefully to take up the loans which are available. If the Ministry of fuel and Power considers that there are other and better means of forcing the pace on fuel economy, even if legislation is involved, these should be looked into. There is apparently considerable support on a nation-wide basis for smoke abatement which means considerable interference with the freedom of the industrialist to burn fuelas he likes, and I cannot believe that a properly presented scheme for enforcing fuel economy would not also win popular support.Subsidy on Household Grates12. Now for the proposal to introduce a short-term subsidy on the modernkind of domestic fire. I am firmly of the opinion that a very strong case needs tobe made for every Government subsidy: I do not feel that this case is a strong one.13. Thd cheaper kind of fire which would attract the greater part of thesubsidy mentioned in paragraph 11 of C. (54) 163 is only more efficient than theold-fashioned grate when it is burning coke. I agree with the Minister of Fuel and power that we want to see more of these fires installed. But last year, withoutsubsidy and before the differences in price between large and small coal were extended, over one million of these cheaper improved fires were taken up. Underthe pressure of wider differential prices for coal, the householder has an extraincentive to instal this type of fire at his own expense. It would, therefore, be indefensible in my view to spend a large part of the  1 million suggested by theMinister on improved fires which were going to be installed in any case without a subsidy.14. The more limited proposal (paragraph 12 of C. (54) 163) that there shouldbe a subsidy for one year confined to improved grates installed in the &quot; foggy &quot;areas is, I understand, still under consideration with the Ministry of Housing,in so far as it is presented as an &quot; anti-smog &quot; measure. But would adequate supplies of smokeless fuels be available? And at what prices compared with thoseof coal? Would subsidising the new domestic fires in these areas carry animplication that industrial users should also be subsidised as regards their fuelplant and equipment?Opencast Coal15. Our aim is to have &quot; a forward plan for opencast mining which would do the least harm to agricultural interest.&quot; I hope we can spare the best agricul-tural land unless there is a very strong case indeed that the sacrifice of. li million tons of coal in the next three years would be intolerably damaging to the economy.I am not convinced that there are not better ways of making good this loss, or that any of the additional losses resulting from a reduction in confidence amongcontractors need arise.16.   To sum up: (a) The British Electricity Authority and the Gas  Council should be encouraged to increase their consumption of oil in those cases wherethey agree that the use of oil would be commercially justifiable.(b) We ought not to &quot; direct&quot; the nationalised industries, against their com-mercial judgment, to engage in uneconomic activities of the kind proposed in C. (54) 163.(c) The policy of letting prices find their proper level should be extended inthe case of coal as opportunity offers.(d) There should be a drive to recruit more miners. ,(e) The Minister of Transport should urge the British Transport Commissionto produce plans for further railway electrification.    ,...(/) The Minister of Fuel and. Power should consider, whether it; is feasible to induce or enforce fuel economy in cases where coal is being wasted,unnecessarily.                                        .  .\.&apos;. &apos;(g) There should be no Government subsidy on the general run of improved&apos;&quot; &apos;   -&quot;grates.-&apos; &quot;&apos; &apos;......     &apos;Treasury.
