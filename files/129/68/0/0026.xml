Printed for the Cabinet.   May  1954SECRETCABINET office record copy copy No.71C. (54)17624th May, 1954CABINETSTATEMENT ON CIVIL DEFENCE PLANSNote by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister for Welsh affairs attach for the consideration of the Cabinet the draft of a statement on civil defence plans, which I propose to make in the House of Commons on Friday,Home Office, S.W.1,24th May, 1954.As I have already indicated to the House, the implications of our recent increaseof knowledge about the effects of the hydrogen bomb were immediately made thesubject of study from the Civil Defence aspect. It must be some time before this study is completed. In the meantime I have in consultation with my colleaguestried to extract the most important results apparent from a preliminary examination.2. The Prime Minister has stated that the coming of the hydrogen bombmakes the threat of a world war less and not more likely. But if the danger ofwar has receded it is also largely because we have been strong and Civil defence is an important part of our preparations and our strength. Unless all possible steps are taken to minimise the effects of air attack, to succour the injured and to relieve the homeless, the morale of the civil population could not be sustained andthat of the Armed Forces might suffer. Qur predecessors made a start with thedevelopment of a civil defence organisation and it is our clear duty to continue with all practicable measures.3. This does not mean that we propose to embark on a large new-programmeinvolving increased expenditure. What has, however, become incumbent on usis to revise.our:plans in the light of our present knowledge and to reshape themto meet the new danger and this may involve superseding some of our plans by others of a different kind, I do not want to minimise the possibilities, but greatlyexaggerated stories have been put about and it has even been suggested, for example,that a single bomb could destroy the whole of Britain. If we compare the actualarea of destruction of a hydrogen bomb with that of an atom bomb, the pictureis,Of course, a formidable one but not one which justifies a defeatist attitude. Fromground zero the radius for total destruction with the atom bomb was about ^ mile,of very serious damage about   mile, and of lighter damage about 1J miles. Thecorresponding figures for the Eniwetok bomb of 1952 were estimated to be 3,&quot;7 and10 miles. On any foreseeable facts, there would be few, if any, probable targetswhere, evendf the bomb were delivered on the centre, there would not be marginalareas where much could be done by an efficient civil defence organisation.4. Apart from structural damage, account must be taken of the.danger fromradio-active contamination, Alarming accounts have been published regardingthis. &apos; It is true that there would be very heavy contamination in the immediateneighbourhood of a bomb landing on or near the ground, but the publicity that28th May.D.

the radio-active hazard has received results largely from skin injuries to someJapanese fishermen in the Pacific downwind from the explosion and beyond the range of the blast. That incident demonstrates the need for knowledge andemphasizes the necessity for civil defence training. Indeed, the simplest precaution(even taking shelter below deck level) would probably, I understand, have been sufficient to protect these men. The technical and organisational problems involved in creating a proper system of precautions are being studied as a matterof urgency and instructions will be issued as soon as this study has been completed.There can be no doubt that with good civil defence casualties would be greatly reduced.5. Whatever may emerge from the completion of our study of these andother aspects of the civil defence problem, these points are clear:  (i) It is still essential to have local Services of trained and organised men andwomen to deal with the consequences of attack, and in particular toassist those who are trapped, injured or rendered homeless and tofight fires. It will be impossible to build up sufficient war-time Servicesunless we maintain and reach our peace-time establishments. We arebarely two-thirds of the way.(ii) Therefore we intend to press on with the recruitment and training of theCivil Defence Corps, the Auxiliary Fire Service and the NationalHospital Service Reserve.(iii) We believe that it is vital that there should be greater co-operationbetween the Industrial Civil Defence Service and the local authority services. The new developments make it necessary to consider thewhole area and not merely to concentrate on the industrial front.(iv) Dispersal clearly has a greatly increased relative importance.  The plansalready made for evacuating the priority classes need to be revised.Particular attention must be given to the dispersal of stocks and equip-ment and to our emergency and mobile feeding organisations and this may involve giving other measures a lower priority. With the shift of emphasis to dispersal there goes an increased importance for the workof women in Civil Defence.(v) The training manuals will be revised and the training syllabuses adjustedas quickly as possible. In the meantime the standard system of traininghitherto presented is still sound: in fire-fighting, or welfare, or rescueit makes little difference whether the fire has been started or a persontrapped or another rendered homeless by the hydrogen bomb, the atomic bomb or conventional weapons. Those who have done, or are doing, this training will not find it wasted.(vi) Local services are necessary, but not enough. It will be necessary to place an even greater emphasis than hitherto on a mobile organisation, basedso far as possible outside the main areas of population but available tohelp them. The plans for the creation of trained reserves for services in Mobile Columns which were announced in the Defence Debate on 2nd March will be brought into operation as soon as possible.(vii) Our operational organisation will be improved and changes will be madein the machinery of control for the purpose of giving effect to theprinciple of mobility and securing closer liaison with the Armed Forces.6. In all these matters we must neither minimise nor exaggerate the problem.What we have to do is to assess the risk carefully and pay the whole of what seemsto us a reasonable insurance premium against the risk. And we must remembertoo that we are all in this together. We cannot think only of our own danger orour own safety. If our neighbour^ defences are neglected or ineffective, our ownare less secure. In all emergencies, whether in war or in such peacetime disastersas the East Coast floods, we must be able to call on trained help from the neighbouring towns and districts.7. The further examination of the points I have mentioned and of. of hermeasures such as warnings, communications and shelter are in the first instancebeing undertaken by the Civil Defence Joint Planning Staff., Local authorities and;others concerned will be given any necessary guidance as to these measures forwhich they are responsible. In the meantime, it is their clear duty to proceed withthe measures which they have been asked to undertake. I have no doubt that wecan rely on their co-operation in this work.
