The Memorial Fund Committee decided in 1952 that a statue of His lateMajesty in a noble setting in London should form part of the National Memorial,and a Sub-Committee was set up under the chairmanship of the then Lord Mayor,Sir Leslie Boyce, to select the site and the memorial. After several sites had beenconsidered the present one was approved by the Queen.3. Mr. William McMillan, R.A. was selected to be the sculptor for thestatue, which with Her Majesty&apos;s agreement will be in bronze, and will depict thelate King standing in undress naval uniform with the Garter mantle. Mr. Louisde Soissons, R.A. was appointed as architect. The site and the proposals for the memorial itself have the approval of the Royal Fine Art Commission.4.
