FUTURE OF THE AIRFRAME industry memorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and ScienceAt their meeting on 2nd August (CC(66) 41st Conclusions,Minute 6) the Cabinet approved the appointment of a Sub-committee under my chairmanship to consider and make recommendations on thefuture of the airframe industry, which in practice means the future ofthe British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) and Hawker Siddeley AviationLimited (HSA) who are the two main companies in this industry!background.       The background to this subject is the Plowden Report on theAircraft Industry (Cmnd 2853), and in particular Chapter 37 on thefuture financial arrangements for the industry.     The committee recommended that there should be some degree of public ownership of the two main airframe companies;  they considered but rejected100 per cent nationalisation, and concluded that the balance of advantage lay in favour of the Government acquiring a shareholding in BAC andHSA.    The majority of the Committee felt that over half the equityshould be in Government ownership to give the degree of control thatwould make it possible for the Government to forgo detailed technical and financial control of projects by the Ministry of Aviation.     the minority felt that this objective could be attained with less than halfthe equity in Government ownership.     Mr, Aubrey Jones, in a reservation, dissented from these conclusions;  he did not think thata degree of Government ownership would of itself ease government control and he thought that it would lead to a less commercial approach on the part of the industry.    He, thought that the Committee&apos;s objectivescould be achieved without Government ownership of any part of the equity.3,       The issues and the possible courses of action were discussed in memoranda by the then First Secretary of State (C(66) 119), and theMinister of Aviation (ED(66) 71).    They were more fully argued intwo memoranda which formed the basis of the Sub-Committee!discussions, one by the Minister of Aviation (Appendix A, which shouldbe considered in conjunction with ED(66) 71) and one by myself(Appendix B),    In the hope of sparing my colleagues the need to readthrough all this paper in detail, I endeavour now to summarise at least the main points.HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 142 COPY NO,     6 718th October, 1966CABINET
Future Load4.       When the Cabinet discussed this, it was suggested that the key-question for the future of the airframe industry was the future load onthe industry.    Accordingly we asked the Minister of Aviation to give usa full report on the prospects for the industry over the next ten years,and the main conclusions of a report by a Working Party on aircraft industry loading are set out in an annex to this memorandum.5.       A number of major uncertainties overhang the industry,,     the picture cannot be regarded as wholly assured in respect of theAnglo-French Variable Geometry aircraft, the airbus or the P11270We considered whether at any rate for some of these projects thefuture might look a little clearer in six months&apos; time, and whether we should therefore do better to postpone decisions until then.    Butit is now ten months since Plowden reported;  there are signs that delay in the announcement of Government decisions is beginning to damagemorale in the industry and lead to loss of staff;  and moreover I )experience suggests that there is hardly ever a time when there arenot major uncertainties about the future of this industry.    The general pattern and scale of its activities over the next ten years are, however,reasonably clear;  future decisions on projects may modify them butare not likely to alter them fundamentally (unless, perhaps, the FrenchGovernment were eventually persuaded to abandon Concord).    Wetherefore concluded that decisions should not be deferred on this account.6.       The general picture is that, while total output is not expectedto change very greatly over the next ten years, within the total the share of Government work and of military sales is likely to fall offconsiderably in the early 1970&apos;s.     Total expenditure on research anddevelopment (both civil and military) will remain high until about1970 but will decline thereafter;  in particular, by 1976 militaryresearch and development may well be at a level only one-third of present expenditure.    The level of employment in the two maincompanies is expected to fall from 65,000 in 1966 to under 40,000 in1976,    The level of Government support which the industry receiveswill be higher in the second half of the 1960&apos;s than in the early 1960&apos;s,but from 1970 will begin to decline to a level which by 1975 is likelyto be considerably lower than in the early 1960&apos;s.Objectives7.      We are all agreed:(a)    That the airframe and guided weapons interests and activitiesof BAG and HSA should be rationalised.     There is still scope for much internal rationalisation of production and designresources within each of them.    Eventually the twoorganisations should merge.     The timing of this should bedetermined by the programme of work as it evolves, but itwould be advisable to bring the two companies as soon aspossible under a single management, with power to ensurethat the joint resources are used in the most economic manner and to make plans for a merger.
(b)    That our objective in the rationalisation should be to get astrong management which will carry through this rationalisation-tion and face up to the difficult decisions that it will require,and at the same time to retain for the British airframe industry the best possible design and technical staff.8.       On past form BAC have been strong on the design and technicalside, with some notable aircraft to their credit, the BAC 111 being themost recent example.    Hawker Siddeley have been less good on design,and have not launched a new civil project since I960.    Each of the two groups was formed by the amalgamation of various companies early inI960, and both have been extremely slow to effect any significant degreeof integration of activities.    But Hawkers have benefited from havingone parent rather than three and have set up a simplified companystructure.    The BAC top management has been less effective than hadbeen hoped.     The strong top management of Hawker Siddeley has givenHSA  an air of greater financial and commercial shrewdness.Whatever new organisation now emerges should combine the virtuesof both companies:  a strong design and technical staff, with a resoluteand expert top management, particularly on the financial and commercialside..v.&apos;...,:&apos; v v -       &apos;:     &apos;9.       In deciding how to achieve this we have to take into account thepossible reactions of the industry.    There v/ill be less upheaval, and less danger of losing key people, if we can come to a reasonablyamicable conclusion with the industry.    So far as we know the positionis as follows:(a) The two companies are very unlikely to merge of their own accord.(b) The parent companies of BAC are not interested in going intopartnership with the Government,     They have expressed a clesire forthe Government to acquire a 100 per cent holding,(c) Some elements in BAC might oppose 100 per cent public owner-ship of BAC if that was the prelude to merging BAC and HSA in a new company in which Hawker Siddeley had the major interest and themanagerial control, since they v/ould expect HSA to give preference toHawker personnel in reorganisation.    It is not clear if any BAC staff would push their opposition to the point of resigning and leaving theindustry rather than accept a merger with KSA,    Nor is it clear whether these staff would also oppose 100 per cent public ownership of BAC if itcoincided with 100 per cent public ownership of HSA as a prelude torationalisation under a public corporation.     To all except perhaps themost senior design and technical staff one would expect that the prospects of continuing work would be more important than the ownership of theorganisation.(d) Hawker Siddeley are now in a position to pull out of the airframeindustry after 1970 if they wish, and it seems that they will not under-take any new major commitments with their own money going beyond that date, at any rate until the future of the industry is settled.    If we decided to leave things as they are, Hawker Siddeley would probablypull out.    They would not want to continue as they are in competition with a 100 per cent publicly owned BAC, for fear that the Governmentwould give preference to BAC in allotting contracts and providingassistance.     They would not go into partnership with a majorityGovernment shareholding.    They would welcome an arrangement-3-
whereby they were in charge of the assets and activities of the tv/ocompanies, and would accept a Government minority shareholding.If BAC were being taken over by the Government Hawker Siddeleywould probably not in the end refuse to sell the whole of the KSAequity to the Government, if the price was reasonable.     Their ideas of a reasonable price might well however be different from ours, andsome of us doubt whether they would in practice refrain from publiclyopposing 100 per cent nationalisation of the industry.Possible Courses of Action10.       V/e have considered four possible courses of action:(a) To leave things as they are.(b) To take a majority holding in both companies, and use themajority power to carry through rationalisation.(c) To take over the whole of the equity of BAC, and then mergeBAC and HSA into a new company in which the former BAC equitywould represent a substantial minority shareholding for the Government.(d) To take both companies into 100 per cent public ownership,bringing them as separate companies under a new public corporation,which would also take over responsibility for other airframe interestsin public ownership (e, g. the Government holding in Shorts, and theBeagle Aircraft Company), and would be charged with the duty ofrationalising the industry.11.       We are agreed that we cannot leave things as they are.    Ifwe do that, Hawker Siddeley will fade out, and probably eventuallyBAC also,    We are agreed that a majority shareholding would be practicable only with the agreement and co-operation of the industry,and that this v/ould not be forthcoming;  there are also other reasons(into which I need not go) why this solution would not be attractive forthe Government even if it were practicable.     That leaves the coursessummarised in paragraphs 10(c) and (d) above.12,       The main arguments for 100 per cent nationalisation of bothcompanies and against the minority shareholding solution are:(a)     The Government are the industry s main customer and willcontinue to have to find 100 per cent of the finance required for militaryprojects.    Hitherto the Government have been contributing up to one half of the launching costs of major civil projects.    Now BAC on the concord and PISA on the airbus have indicated that the Government willhave to find the whole of the launching costs of future major civilprojects, and a share of working capital for production as well.    this could set a precedent for the Government bearing virtually all therisk on all major projects in future.    The annual amounts at stake are so large in relation to the value of the equity, and the Governmentsdominance in the affairs of the industry is so great, that 100 per centpublic ownership is, as the Plowden Committee put it, no more than a realistic recognition of the dominant role of the Government in theindustry&apos;s affairs.     The responsibility for providing capital, for makingcritical decisions and for dealing with the industrial consequences ofthose decisions would thus be concentrated firmly in the hands of a corporation appointed by and responsible to the Government.
(b) If the companies will not risk private capital on major ventures,the normal commercial sanctions will not bite, and a private enterprisemanagement will have little or no commercial incentive to responsibility and efficiency,(c) With a minority shareholding in a new company, the majorityshare of which would be owned by Hawker Siddeley, there would be therisk of conflict of interest.     Though under the Companies Act provisions,possibly supplemented by reserve powers, the Government as a minorityshareholder would retain certain rights of veto, they would not be ableto impose their views on future policy or on questions of management,(d) The need to reduce detailed financial and technical control of projects was one of the main objectives of the Plowden recommendations.In the view of the Minister of Aviation this objective can be achieved only if the industry is 100 per cent publicly owned.    It would be inappropriate for the day to day activities of a public corporation to be controlled indetail;  there would no longer be any question of undue benefits to private interests, and the Government would have the powers to dismissmembers of the corporation if they lost confidence in their capacity to manage the affairs of the industry and to run projects efficiently,(e) Objections in BAC to incorporation in a company dominated byHawker Siddeley could lead to resignations of key design and technical staff, who might well be lost to this country,(f) It would be politically hard to justify a course of action involving the takeover of BAC and a merger of a publicly owned BAC with aprivately owned HSA.    This would be presented by hostile opinion astaking BAC into public ownership and then giving it back to privateenterprise,(g) HSA&apos;s lack of initiative on the civil project side since I960suggests that they might not provide the industry with the leadership itneeds.13.       The main arguments for the minority shareholding solution and against 100 per cent nationalisation are:(a) The industry must contract and rationalise, and as its militarywork falls away its civil work will become increasingly important toit.    In these circumstances commercial disciplines and commercialexpertise will be more rather than less necessary than in the past,A predominantly private enterprise organisation is more exposed tosuch disciplines, and more likely to possess such expertise, than apublicly owned corporation.    A public corporation might also be at a disadvantage in meeting the competition of overseas private enterprises(particularly American firms) in international markets.(b) It is questionable whether we should be in a hurry to nationalisean industry which is not a &quot;commanding height&quot; and is about to enter upon a period of contraction and rationalisation.    The process of rationalisation will involve tough and difficult decisions.    As a majoritycustomer and a minority shareholder the Government would not whollyavoid the odium in the decisions, but they might find it ea.sier to meetthe pressures and answer the criticisms that the decisions would entail if they were the decisions of a commercial management ratherthan of a public corporation.-5-
(c) Specifically, the management of Hawker Siddeley has thetoughness, and the financial and commercial expertise, which will be needed; but it would almost certainly not be available to a whollypublicly owned industry.    Good management is even more difficult tosecure than good design and technical staff.    We could certainly find a management for a public corporation;  it is not so certain that we could find a management that was sufficiently tough, efficient and experienced in the working problems of the aircraft industry.(d) A substantial minority shareholding, combined with theGovernments power as a purchaser and a source of working capital,should give the Government sufficient influence on the policy of themerged company.    Ideally the majority holding should be diversified,so that the Governments share was the largest single shareholding.If that were not possible the Government might need to negotiate certainreserve powers (for instance, on the right of veto on the appointment ofa chairman), but such reserve powers could and should be kept to aminimum.(e) It is unlikely that Government participation in ownership would reduce the need for detailed technical and financial control of projectsby the Ministry of Aviation or its successor.    It will make little difference from this point of view whether the industry is wholly or partly owned by the Government, or whether a part holding is amajority or a minority share of the equity.    Moreover the questionof undue benefits to private interests, which is of much widerapplication, will shortly be resolved by the insertion of &quot;post-costing&quot;conditions in all appropriate Government contracts.    What matters here is not the precise form and degree of ownership but efficiency of management.(f) It is not clear that those in BAC who would object to a mergerwith HSA would object any less to incorporation in a nationalised industry of which the old HSA would inevitably be a major part.    There is room for doubt whether the ownership of the industry is as important to design and technical staff as a settled prospect and an assured, programmeof work.(g) It would cost the Exchequer much less to take over BAC alonethan to take over both companies.14.      Four general points should be added:(a)    Whatever solution we adopt, the assets of both companies willhave to be valued, whether for the purpose of assessing the purchase price or for deciding the relevant size of shareholdings in a new company resulting from a merger.    The process of valuation willbe difficult and controversial;  and, if we are going for the minorityshareholding solution, Hawker Siddeley will want to be associated withthe valuation of the BAC assets because of its implications for the size of the Government holding in the new company.    On the other hand the valuation of the HSA assets might present slightly less difficulty if thepurpose was simply to decide upon the relevant shares in a new company(since absolute precision would not be necessary) than if the purpose was to decide on a purchase price.
(b) The merger of the two organisations is the prior condition of rationalisation and of the increased efficiency that should result.    if both companies are taken over 100 per cent, the next year or so willbe taken up with the business of nationalisation, and the two organisa-tions will continue to go on as they are.    Rationalisation will be post-poned until there is a public corporation to undertake it.    Thusrationalisation, and a term to the uncertainty in the industry, would come earlier on the basis of the minority shareholding solution (giventhe right calibre of management) than on the basis of 100 per centnationalisation.(c) Neither solution would be unopposed or uncontroversial, inside the industry or more widely.    If we go for the minority shareholdingsolution, some people in BAC may object to a merger in which HSAwould be the dominant partner (though one doubts whether they v/would have very rational grounds for their objection).     The parent companies of BAC might be tiresome (though, as they would be getting out, theirneed or right to concern themselves with the future structure of theindustry would be questionable).    Hawker Siddeley would welcome thatsolution.    We should meet some criticism for taking over BAC and then&quot;giving it back&quot; to private enterprise.    But we could present thatpositively and constructively as a scheme of rationalisation, consistent with the general Plowden recommendation and likely to reap theadvantages which the Plowden Committee expected to flow from their recommendations.    It could prove to be a useful precedent, likeFairfields, for other measures of rationalisation in which privateenterprise and Government co-operated and shared responsibility forthe development of an efficient industry in the national interest.    If wewent for 100 per cent nationalisation of both companies, there might be some objections from key personnel in both companies.    The managementsmight not in the end resist, though we should certainly have a roughpassage in negotiating a price for the assets.    But Hawkers would be almost bound publicly to oppose nationalisation (which they would describeas confiscation if we did not offer what they regarded as a reasonable price);  and the parent companies of BAC might well follow theirexample.    We have to reckon that this would certainly broaden out into ageneral controversy on the nationalisation issue, on broadly predictablepolitical lines,(d) A decision to go for the minority shareholding solution now wouldnot exclude a decision to go for 100 per cent nationalisation later.Obviously the reverse is not true.    If we went for the minority share-holding solution, and either our negotiations with Hawker Siddeley broke down or the arrangements proved not to work out in practice, we could then go on to nationalise the whole industry.    We should not want toindicate in the initial negotiations for a minority shareholding solutionthat we had this possibility in our minds; but we should hardly need todo so, since the possibility would certainly be in the minds of the other side.     There may be advantages, particularly at this point of time, ingoing for the smaller step in the first instance.Conclusion15.       The Sub-Committee on Aviation were evenly divided between these two solutions, and I have therefore to ask the Cabinet to decide.The argument is nicely balanced;  there will be difficulties whatever we decide to do.    My own conclusion is still in favour of the minorityCO IJVl Fl BE; KITIIAL
shareholding.    But the Minister of Aviation is the Minister responsiblefor the industry, and the fact that he supports 100 per cent nationalisationmust therefore carry great weight.C. A.R.C.V Department of Education and Science, W, 1.17th October, 1966CONFSBENTEAl
ANNEXCONCLUSIONS OF A REPORT BY THE WORKING party on AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY LOADING(a) The aircraft industry&apos;s total output is not expected to changevery greatly over the next ten years.(b) Within the total, the shares of government work and ofmilitary sales fall off considerably in the early seventies, but riseagain at the end of the period.(c) There is a very rapid prospective fall in military R and D inthe last part of the period.    By 1976 this may have reached a levelonly one-third of present expenditure.(d) Total expenditure on R and D, for civil and military purposescombined, is at present rising and will remain at a high level until1970 or thereabouts.    The increase is largely explained by work onthe Concord project, which is superimposed on a military programme which remains fairly stable until 1970.(e) Within the total of military R and D there is a fall in designcontent.     The prospects for the design labour force in the main air-frame companies, even if there are no reductions or cancellations in programmes, is a continuing decline to a level less than a quarter ofthe present one.    The size and extent of this decline raise some major issues of policy. ,(f) Expenditure on procurement is expected to remain at roughlycurrent levels until about 1971.    Within the total during this period there is a considerable increase in expenditure on engines and adecline with respect to airframes and equipment.    Procurementexpenditure may fall off in the early 1970&apos;s, but is expected to be ata very high level in 1975 and 1976,(g) There is a possibility of slippage in programmes on themilitary side.    Any such tendency would probably make the year-to-year changes in total output even smaller than they now appear on ourprojections.(h) Exports and home civil sales together are expected to remain at a high level, and on our assumptions about Concord and the airbusthe level of exports should considerably exceed the present figure in the early 1970&apos;s.(i) The industry is heavily dependent on a limited number of major projects, especially in the early 1970&apos;s.     Over the years1972-74 the Concord project alone will on our assumptions account for some 20 per cent of the industry&apos;s total output,(j)     The level of support which the industry receives as reckonedby the methods of the Plowden Committee, will be significantly higher in the next five years than in the early 1960&apos;s.    But it will fallsteadily from about 1970 onwards, and in the latter half of the periodit can be expected to be considerably lower than in the p&amp;period 1961-64.
(k)    Detailed projections of employment suggest a continuing declinefrom 1967 or 1968, to a level of perhaps 170, 000 to 180, 000 at the end ofthe period.     The main reduction is expected to be on the airframe andequipment sides of the industry.    A rough projection of employment basedon the output forecasts would suggest a rather later and more gradualdecline, ending with a figure of perhaps 190,000 to 200,000 in 1976.w-2-
v.THE FUTURE OF THE AIRCRAFT industry memorandum by the Minister of aviation was invited at the last meeting of the Sub-Committee on Aviation on10th August to submit further information and comments on my previousproposals and to bring up-to-date the state of major projects.2.     My officials have prepared and circulated the attached paper forconsideration at the official level.   I regret that it has not been possiblefor an earlier meeting to take place.   This paper deals with the arguments forand against various options.   As I said in my original paper ED(66)71j thereis no easy course.   Every possibility (including taking no action at all) is open to objections.   While there are attractions in either taking no action oracquiring B.A.C. and merging it with Hawker Siddeley to give a minoritygovernment interest, on balance, I remain convinced&apos;&quot; that the best course isto acquire a 100$ holding of both groups on the lines proposed in my paper,and I hope therefore that my colleagues will confirm the recommendations madein paragraph 25 of ED(66)71.3.     I should report developments on major projects as followss-CONCORDI have had meetings this month with the French Minister of Equipment(M. Pisani) when he was here for Farnborough and when I visited the Sud factory at Toulouse at his invitation.   There is no doubt of French determination toproceed with the project and I see no way of persuading them to agree otherwise.They have now agreed, although it has taken much longer than we wished, to setup the joint committee of officials to examine economic and commercial prospects,decided at Cabinet on 21st July, 1966 (CC(66)39th Conclusions, item 4)*   It isintended that this committee should report in two months.   We are preparingproposals for sonic bang tests and it may prove possible to have a jointexamination of sonic noise problems.At ,the meeting on 8th September, M. Pisani and I agreed to publish the revised estimates.   It was essential to issue them on this day to avoid priorpublication by the Public Accounts Committee who had been supplied with them on&apos;a confidential basis and who insisted on putting them in their report.   Earlierpublication (i.e. before the House rose) would have been more embarrassing andwould have given rise to difficulties with the French.AIRBUSI reported the earlier discussions to E.D. on 28th February (ED(66)5thmeeting item 4).   Since then it has been established that the Germans are keento participate but there was considerable delay following this intimation asboth the Germans and French spent time exploring possibilities of an/&quot;Atlantic- 1 -
&quot;Atlantic airbus&quot;, one developed jointly between European firms and an Americancompany.   The French have always maintained their interest in a European projectsthe Germans are at least ready to keep the option open until the Americansdecide one way or the other whether to offer cooperation, and if so, on whatterms.There are no definite indications of American intentions in this field atpresent.   The probable outcome is that either Boeing or Lockheed, (i.e. the one who does not get the American supersonic civil transport), will develop a largeshort-medium haul aircraft of 250-300 seats.   Douglas is axso known to be interested.Circumstances are thus favourable to launching a European project but forsuccess a decision will need to be taken in the next few months, both to getahead of the American project (there will certainly be one as estimates of themarket vary from 400-1000) and to meet delivery requirements of Air Prance andother airlines from 1972 onwards. It would now prove difficult to meet the 1972date but we should aim to get as near to it as is technically possible. It isalso essential that the airbus should have operating costs 25-30$ cheaper thancurrent jet aircraft.Hawker Siddeley and representatives of the French and German industries have been asked to prepare a joint report by October 15th of the technical andfinancial aspects of a European project.   It may then be possible to put forward proposals to Ministers prior to further talks with the French and GermanMinisters.    M. Pisani is anxious to get this project moving so that, as he putsit, Concord will not be the swansong of the European aircraft industries.Since we have already virtually decided to get out of the long-haul sub-soniccivil transport field, unless we can participate in the next generation of short-medium haul aircraft, we shall be out of the civil market completely,except for small aircraft.   I hope, therefore, that we can find means to get a European airbus going.   A successful venture would save us dollars on our ownrequirement and bring in considerable exports.HS. 136Hawker Siddeley are on the brink of deciding whether to proceed with this project for a 40-50 seat feeder line jet or Dakota jet replacement.   If theydo decide to proceed they will undoubtedly apply for the usual $Ofo launchingaid for civil aircraft.MILITARY AIRCRAFT(a) Anglo-French V.G. aircraftBoth the French and ourselves were very concerned at the financial aspectsof this aircraft when the Defence Secretary and I met the French Minister forthe Armed Forces in July and its future seemed doubtful.   However the subsequent&apos; work of officials on both requirements and costs suggests that it may now prove a viable project.   I understand that the French are also more optimistic now than in July about its prospects.   It will be recalled that this aircraft was described in this year&apos;s Defence White Paper as &quot;the core of our long-termaircraft programme&quot;.   A detailed report is shortly to be put to Ministers andfurther meetings with the French Minister are planned for the end of October.(b) JaguarProgress will also be reviewed at the October meeting but its continuanceseems assured.(c) P.1127This VTOL aircraft programme is continuing satisfactorily and papers arein preparation for the October Ministerial Review decided upon last March./LIGHT- 2 - -
LIGHT AIRCRAFTAlthough not strictly relevant as the two main airframe groups are notinvolved, I should add that since the last meeting, authority has been givenfor launching aid for the Handley Page Jetstream (a large executive or smallfeeder line aircraft) and a loan approved to expand the production facilities and the Britten-Norman Islander (7-8 seater).   Detailed negotiations to complete the acquisition of Beagle are well-advanced.F.M.Ministry of Aviation,Horse Guards Avenue,S.W.1.29th September, 1966.- 3 -
THE FUTURE OP THE AIRFRAME industry memorandum by the Ministry of Aviation1.     At their meeting on 10th August, the Ministerial Sub-Committee of E.D. onAviation     ......invited the Minister to arrange for his officials, inconsultation with officials of the Treasury, the Department of Economic Affairs,the Board of Trade, and the Ministry of Technology, to examine the technical and organisational aspects and implications of the various possible forms of reorganisation of the airframe industry and to submit the results of this examination, with his own comments and recommendations to the Sub-Committeefor their next meeting.&quot;2.     E.D.(66)71 submitted by the Minister of Aviation to the ministerial committee on Economic Development on 25th July, 1966, set out the background tothis subject and summarised the main considerations bearing on the reorganisationsThe paragraphs which follow are largely a supplement to this paper, in the lightof the points made at the E.D. and E.D.(A) meetings.3.    Among the various possible courses of action open to the Government, therenow seem to be three that should be examined closelys(a) To leave things as they are.(b) To take a part shareholding in the industry, either 50$,or a minority.(c) To take over both groups completely.(a)   Leaving things as they are4.     On the face of it, there are attractions in this course.   By this meanswe would avoid making a substantial investment in an unstable industry and onepresenting considerable management and industrial problems.   It might indeed be argued that the basic concerns of the industry, namely the need for a stableprogramme of work and the need to improve productive efficiency, are unafftcted by changes in ownership.5.     But we must look deeper than this, and firstly at the financial situationin the two groups.   Of their three principal companies of B.A.C., bristol aeroplane have sold their holding to Rolls Royce who want to get rid of it,English Electric are chary of any new investment in civil projects, and Vickerswant to quit aircraft manufacture.   There is no hope of B.A.C. raising any significant amount of new risk capital from private sources.   The Governmentwill have to finance the whole Concord programme, including production, andfurnish the whole of the money needed to stretch the VC-10 and BAC.1-11 whichBEA are considering.   Hawker Siddeley though much the stronger companyfinancially have not launched a major new aircraft project for five or six years.   They would be the likely contractor for the British part of theEuropean airbus if it gets off the ground and have participated in theindustrial studies for it.   But they have already said that the government must provide the development finance and possibly some part of the productionexpenditure.   In parallel, Government missile and military aircraft projectswill continue to be financed wholly from Government funds.6.    Thus the Government faces the prospect of providing virtually all therisk capital for the forward aircraft programme, civil and military, and thereare no present indications that this situation is likely to change in future.7.     Of course, if we were to provide a stable programme for the industry, andpump in sufficient money, the two groups could be expected to carry onindefinitely as they are now.   But since neither group would be risking theirown money, there would be no incentive to financial responsibility and business efficiency.   We see grave objections to vast sums of public moneybeing hazarded under these circumstances.
8.    Even if we were prepared for this, there is another significant factor,namely, morale in the industry.   This is low.   It is touch and go whether theindustry will be able over the nest year or so to keep sufficient high qualitydesigners and technicians and thus to retain the capability for developingmajor new military and civil aircraft of the future, since the pull of a thrivingand even overloaded U.S. industry is very strong.   If all the main projects ofthe next generation could be approved within a month or two, namely, Concordproduction, V.G. aircraft, Airbus, HS.136, etc., there would be no problem.But this is unrealistic, since it may take us many months to reach decisions onall these.   It is, therefore, urgent that the question of government participation,raised by Plowden last December, should be settled soon.9.     If our long term expectation for the industry were that it would becomepredominantly a sub-contracting agent for the United States, there would bea lot to be said for letting it find its own level under commercial forces.But we have repeatedly proclaimed our intention to maintain a strong and healthyindustry, and we cannot allow it to disintegrate by default.10.   Even if we had doubts about the long term competitive ability of ourairframe firms, a substantial airframe capability in this country is essentialto maintain the strength of our aero-engine and equipment companies.   We couldnot hope to exploit the full commercial potential of these companies withoutretaining a capability for independent design and development of airframes.   Inparticular, the powerful aero-engine merger in the offing might prove abortive.11.   A possible intermediate solution would be to take over B.A.C. completelyand leave Hawker Siddeley in private hands.   Hawker Siddeley would be highlysuspicious of such an arrangement, and would fear discrimination in favour ofthe nationalised undertaking.   This would almost certainly prompt them to leavethe aircraft field as soon as their current programmes come to and end.   Theyare now placed in a position where they could steadily run down their aircraftinterests by about 1970.(b)   A Part Shareholding12.   In the earlier discussions some Ministers had reservations about a 100$take-over of the industry and thought that outright nationalisation (even onthe assumption that this would be done with the consent of the owners) might be interpreted particularly abroad, as an irrelevance in the present economic circumstances.   They thought that the alternative of a partnership between government and industry, on the lines recommended in the Plowden Report, should first be considered further.13.   One possibility would be a 50/50 holding?   but we can see no virtue in this.Under Company Law the important changeover points in holding are at 25$ and 75$*A minority holding of 25$ provides an assurance that the Objects of the company,or its Articles, cannot be altered without consent, nor its capital reduced.Special reserved rights can be negotiated but it is unlikely that the Governmentwould obtain significantly stronger rights by a 50$ shareholding than by 25$ or30$.   On the other hand, in the public eye, a 50$ holding would imply that theGovernment was responsible for the industry, but we would lack effective controlover it.   Prom the point of view of the industry, it would not be clear as towho was in charge, and Hawker Siddeley would almost certainly find thearrangement unacceptable.14*   The B-P arrangement is often invoked as a successful example of a 50/50arrangement.   But the oil industry is commercially prosperous and by convention the Government is little more than a sleeping partner in B-P.   The situation inthe aircraft industry is by no means analogous.15.   If a part shareholding by the Government were desired, it would be moresensible to make this a minority.   One way of achieving this would be for theGovernment to take over B.A.C. completely and then merge the undertaking with .S.A.     Since the value of B.A.C. at current rates would be likely to be less/than
than half the combined value of the two companies, we would thus have a substan-tial minority holding in the combined organisation.   Hawker Siddeley would alsofavour a solution on these lines since it would leave them in majority control.There are several attractions in it from the Government&apos;s point of view.   Thecost would be much less than that of a full take-over of both firms, and would leave open the possibility of full take-over later, if desired.   Jin the matterof cost, however, it should not be overlooked that the valuation of the assets,which would form the basis of the negotiations over the purchase price, wouldreflect the future prospects of the companies.   The fact that the industry facesa period of decline and subsequent uncertainty would thus I:a taken account of inthe price paid^J   Commercial sanctions and pressures would remain to the limited extent possible in an industry almost wholly dependent upon Government money.If there should be a serious contraction in the workload of the industry, calling for rationalisation on a substantial scale, the main burden of the responsibilityfor unpopular measures would nominally rest with Hawker Siddeley, though theGovernment would in practice still get most of the blame.16.   It must be recognised that the Government&apos;s status in such an arrangement would inevitably reflect the fact that the holding was a minority one only.   Itsrole would tend to be passive rather than active.   The arrangement would necessarily have to be one under which the Government sought to influence thecompany policy rather than to control it.   The means of influencing it wouldhave to be mainly through reserved rights secured as part of the initial deal.17&quot;   Any such reserved rights could be acquired, if at all, only by negotiation.The Fairfields arrangement provides a guide as to what we might aim to achievein the way of reserved rights, but it must be remembered that this was on thebasis of a 50-50 partnership5   and the Government were in a particularly strongbargaining position, since the only alternative for the firm was immediatecollapse.   The rights which were obtained by the Government represent themaximum that we could hope to secure with a holding of less than 50$ in themerged airframe organisation.   All the indications are that Hawker Siddeleywould be extremely tough in their bargaining, and the outcome of the negotiationscannot be taken for granted in advance.   Hawker Siddeley made this clear whenthey told us that if the Government took a minority holding in H.S.A., theGovernment could not then expect powers appropriate to a majority holding.18.   The sort of reserved rights (apart from a veto on the choice of Chairmanof the Board) which would be essential to protect the Government investment would be agreement that decisions by the Board would have to be unanimous ifinvolving an increase in share or loan capital, disposal or acquisition of substantial assets, and capital expenditure of more than a certain sum (perhaps 500,000).   In addition, the Government might find itself in an embarrassing position if unanimity was not also required for decisions to diversify,association with other firms, e.g. American or European companies, and paymentof dividends.   It cannot be assumed that Hawker would agree to any of them, itis judged unlikely that they would readily agree to more than the first two(viz., the requirement of unanimity for increases in capital or disposal of substantial assets).   Hawkers would probably ask for some reserved rights inreturn, e.g., perhaps the right to be bought out completely in certaincircumstances such as continuing poor profit record.19.   Even if all these reserved powers were secured, however, the arrangementhas some serious disadvantages.   The Government would have no power to imposeits views on the form future rationalisation of the industry should take, either from the aviation or distribution of industry points of view.   It would have no power to secure the replacement of managers who had proved inadequate.   hawker siddeley would probably deal drastically with the present B.A.C. set-up, andthere are some features of this, particularly on design, we should want to conserve.   The Government would still be obliged to provide the greater partof the risk capital on new projects through launching aid (and even on production in the case of the Concord and probably the Airbus) while themajority control of the organisation would remain in the hands of a private company.   Finally, the change in the relationship between Government and. /industry
industry would probably not be sufficiently fundamental to permit any substantialrelaxation in the financial and technical controls which are now exercised bythe Ministry of Aviation, and which are dictated mainly by statutory requirementsIt will be recalled that the Plowden Committee attached great importance to theneed to relieve the companies of a good deal of this detailed supervision, whichthey regarded as a brake on efficient and dynamic management.(c)   100$ Take-over of both Groups20.   This is the solution which the Minister recommended i:. ED(66)71, enablingus as it would to achieve the fullest possible extent and in the quickest time,the main objectives of re-organisation.   But before reaching a decision inprinciple on this, it is desirable to look in more detail at the management structure and finances of the two groups.21.   The structure of B.A.C. and Hawker Siddeley is described in Annex A.Management22.   It is difficult to make judgments about the respective competence of thegeneral managements of B*A.C. and Hawker Siddeley, and even more difficult tocompress these into a few paragraphs.   The following are the general impressionsof the Department.23.   B.A.C. are stronger on design.   Quite apart from the stature of Sir GeorgeEdwards (the only man in the industry with a world-wide reputation as a designer)the design elements in the management divisions are well led, particularly atPreston and Filton, and the middle grade technicians are most promising.   OnlyB.A.C. has designed supersonic military and civil aeroplanes.   On the whole,however, the senior commercial and production management of the Company doesnot inspire the same confidence, nor have any figures of authority yet emergedas possible successors to Sir George Edwards.24.   Hawker Siddeley have not the same strength of leadership on design either in their factories, or at the centre now that Sir Sidney Camm has gone, though there are many competent technicians in the middle and lower grades.   On theBoard of Hawker Siddeley Aviation, which appears to exercise a stronger central control, commercial and financial elements predominate.25.   On production, there is little to choose between the two groups.   Thereare good and indifferent factories in each.   In the selection of projects,Hawker Siddeley have been more successful, mainly because they have ventured so little, (they have, for example, now dithered for five years over launching theHS.I36, a Dakota replacement and a relatively modest venture).   The past records of the constituent companies which led up to the formulation of the large groupsdo not suggest that one group has been significantly shrewder than the other.26.   In any rationalised and revitalised industry we would hope to retain thebest managerial elements, on design and production, in both Companies.   Theyshould complement each other in the right form of organisation.   How particularindividuals would react to any particular measures or re-organisation is of courslargely a matter of conjecture.   But we think the prospects of retaining a competent management would be rather better in a 100$ Government set-up than inone with split ownership.   It can be assumed that the whole of Hawker Siddeleywould welcome an arrangement whereby they would retain a controlling commercialinterest in a merged group.   On the other hand, Sir George Edwards would be most unlikely to stay in an organisation dominated by Hawker Siddeley.-Merger27.   Some Ministers have asked what scope there is for rationalising theindustry through a merger, and whether the Government&apos;s aims could be secured without any shareholding at all.   In the first place, the Minister deployed. I fairly
fairly fully in his earlier paper (paras. 13 and 14) the reasons why we thinkit would be premature to embark on a physical merger of the two groups at thisstage, though the apparatus for effecting this in due course could be set upstraight away.   It was with this in mind that the setting up of a NationalAirframe Board with jurisdiction over both companies was recommended.   In thepresent state of uncertainty in the industry we see no prospect of any majormeasure of re-organisation coming about on the airframe side without direct government intervention.   It is no use our hoping that the airframe companies will emulate the aero-engine companies and initiate a re-organisation on commercial lines.   Their morale is too low and they lack the confidence and themoney for such a move.   Hawker Siddeley&apos;s have also made it clear that they arenot interested in finding the capital necessary to acquire B.A.C. on Rolls-Royce-Bristol Siddeley lines.   The desire of the principle shareholders of B.A.C. to limit or get out of their aircraft investment rules out any move on their part to acquire Hawker Siddeleys.28.   Some factual information about the finances of the two airframe groupsis set out at Annex B.   Ministers also asked for a forecast of the profits forthe next five years, and an estimate of the level of orders needed to,allow thecompanies to break even, and also for an assessment of the future market for thecompanies1 products.   It is very difficult to provide a forecast of this kind and the variable assumptions are such that an arithmetical picture would beartificial and possibly misleading, but in Part C of Annex &apos;B&apos; we havesummarised the material in paper ED(a)(66)2 giving our best forecasts on thefuture load of work on the industry.   This is perhaps the most reasonablebasis on which to deduce broadly the level of prosperity of the companies.Ministry of Aviation,Horse Guards Avenue,S.W.1.26th September, 1966.

HAWKER SIDDELEY GROUP

1. Hawker Siddeley Group Ltd. is a large public holding company with subsidiary and associated companies both in the United Kingdom and overseas. In the United Kingdom its interests are divided between aircraft and industrial activities, the latter mainly in the electrical and mechanical engineering fields. Although at present it also owns a 50% share and loan interest in Bristol Siddeley Engines Ltd. this interest has now become the subject of an offer for cash by Rolls-Royce Ltd. At the same time Rolls-Royce are bidding to take over Bristol Aeroplane Co. Ltd., who own the other 50% interest in Bristol Siddeley Engines Ltd.

2. At 31st December 1965 the Hawker Siddeley Group had total net assets (including part financed by bank borrowings) of £157M of which just over one-third related to the U.K. aircraft interests.

3. The Board of Hawker Siddeley Group is as follows:

Sir Thomas Sopwith (President)

The directors marked with an asterisk form an executive committee.

4. Hawker Siddeley&apos;s aircraft interests in the U.K. are now divided between two wholly owned subsidiaries, Hawker Siddeley Aviation Ltd. (Airframe) and Hawker Siddeley Dynamics Ltd., (mainly missiles, but including aircraft equipment and propellors). These companies resulted from a reorganisation in management structure in 1963 when the activities and physical assets of a number of separate subsidiaries were merged.

5. Hawker Siddeley Aviation (H.S.A.) is no longer divided into management divisions. It has factories at Kingston-on-Thames, Hatfield, Brough, Chester and Hamble, each of which is managed by local executives. The board of H.S.A. is as follows:

Loans from the principal companies (which are in direct proportion totheir authorised shareholding) can be regarded virtually as additional equityfunds;    interest is payable to the principal companies at 1% over Bank Rate.The  ISM term loan from the Finance Corporation for Industry Ltd. (FCl) madeprimarily to finance the BAC 1-11 falls due for repayment on 30th September1972;    interest is at 1-^5 over Bank Rate at present and will be at        over from 1969.5.     BAC continues to divide its activities between projects undertaken onbehalf of its principal companies and those on its own account.     The picture of the utilisation of finances is therefore not fully reflective of an under-taking working wholly on its own account.I-IA\VKER SIDDEK5Y .AVIATION AKD H^iKSIc SIDDEL5Y DYNAMICS6.     These companies are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Hawker SiddeleyG-roup.     Apart from share capital (itself provided solely by the hawker siddeley G-roup) and retained profits, almost half of the combined assets ofthe two companies is financed by loans from the parent company.     The parentcompany thus acts as virtual banker to its subsidiaries, and hence analysis of the separate companies gives a somewhat unreal picture of the financialrewards behind these activities.     Some details of the parent company aretherefore given below.Shareholdings of the Hawker Siddelex^jj^oup7.     The present share capital of the Group comprises:-Authorised Issued.

Whilst the content of nominee shareholdings is not known,it seems unlikely that at the same date any single shareholder held morethan 5% of the equity capital.Structure ^of..,th^jiawker Siddelj^y^Grpup8.

British Aircraft Corporation10.     The company was incorporated in 19&amp;0 to merge the airframe and missileactivities of Vickers, English Electric Aviation and Bristol Aeroplane Co.By 1963 BAC had also acquired Hunting Aircraft Ltd.     The merger arrangementsprovided that profits or losses on projects in existence when the merger tookplace were to accrue to the principal shareholder companies not to BAC.These were known as &quot;old account&quot; projects as distinct from BAC&apos;s own &apos;nowaccount&apos; projects.     However, to provide a more realistic picture resultsshown&apos; in Table II include activities of cortain subsidiaries of the share-holder companies engaged on &quot;old account projects&quot;.     The figures thereforediffer from those for BAC in Table I which relate to the Corporation on itsown.     There are no separate figures for the Guided Teapons Division,Hawker S^idAelej^^i-ijTCrafjb Interests11.     The Hawker Siddeley Group had several aviation subsidiaries, but therearrangement of the structure of the Group in 1963 resulted in two aircraftcompanies - HSA (airframes) and had (Guided Weapons),     Figures in Table IIto 1962 are totals for all the aircraft subsidiaries of the Hawker SiddeleyGroup, but from 19&amp;3 onwards HSA and had are shown separately.C. FUTURE PROSPECTS12.     We do not consider it possible in the present situation of the programme to make a realistic estimate in financial terms of the future commercial prospects of the groups.     However, Table III gives the employment figuresof the past three years (i.e. since the Hawker Siddeley Companies assumedtheir present structure and BAC Guided Weapons division as a separate unitwas formed) and compares them with the projections of labour to be employedon known airframe projects to 1975 prepared for paper ED(aX66)2,     Thoseprojected figures embody certain major assumptions -(a) that Concord   will go ahead(b) that the airbus will be produced from 1970 as an Anglo-Fronch-European collaborative effort(c) Jaguar and VG will go ahead as Anglo-French projects(d) production of current types will end when current orders andoptions and firmly expected orders are fulfilled (i.e. nospectacular unexpected orders will materialise).The picture is therefore weighted heavily to the more optimistic side inrespect of known projects, but omits allowances for any new types which might&quot;emerge in the early 1970s./Table III

The picture shown for BAC is heavily dependent on the successaf Concord.-      If this in fact goes ahead, and BAC receives part ofthe BEA order, the present labour force will not decline drasticallyuntil the mid-1970s.     A crisis will however occur on the design side in this period and this will lead to a lack of viability as anindependent design from beyond that date.     (This point does not emerge from the figures in Table III since these are for total employment inthe groups),     Assuming a correlation between utilisation of labour andthat of capital, current rates of profitability should broadly bemaintained.HSA14.     The picture with HSA looks reasonably rosy until 1970 especially if part of BEA&apos;s order comes their way.     However, from 1970 a drasticfall in workload is envisaged.     This would normally mean uneconomicoverheads.     But new projects may turn up and Hawker Siddeley have proved skilful in diversification, and their overall profit rate maynot suffer as much as might be expected.     Their future in aviation,however, must look bleak.
REORGANISATION OF THE AIRFRAME industry memorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and ScienceAt the meeting of the Subcommittee on Aviation on 10th August weinvited the Minister of Aviation to arrange for an examination of thevarious possible forms of reorganisation of the airframe industry and tooirculate the results to us, with his own comments and recommendations(ED(A)(66) 1st Meeting, Minute 1, Conclusion (3)).    We also thought that other Ministers with views on this matter could usefully circulate notes of their views before our next meeting.     It may help the discussion ofthis matter if I as a layman try to set out what our objectives are, as i see them, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of the possible courses open to us.2.     I think we are all agreed that the airframe interests and activitiesof the two main companies, Hawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA) and the british aircraft Corporation (BAG), should be rationalised, and that this means ineffect merging them in one way or another under a single management.     this result could come about in a number of different ways, but I think it is agreed that it will require injection of money from public funds, on a scale which would call for a measure of public ownership.     The main objectives which govern our choice of ultimate structure and ownership are -(i)   to get a tough and efficient management, which wild, have both theknowledge  of what needs to be done and the determination to do it(ii)   to get a greater measure of Government influence on the general direction and management of the industry, as distinct from control of particular projects.Whatever we decide to do should serve these objectives;   but in making up our minds we need also to have some regard for what we know about thepossible reactions of those who are at present in charge of the industry.There will be less upheaval, and less danger of losing key people, if wecan come to a reasonably amicable conclusion with the industry.-1-CONFIDENTLAL
3.     The choice is in effect between -(i)   a company with a majority Government shareholding - the solutionfavoured by the majority of the Plowden Committee;(ii)   a company with a minority Government shareholding - the solutionfavoured by the minority of the Plowden Committee;(iii)   a public corporation wholly owned by the Government (100 per centnationalisation) - the solution recommended by the ISLnister of aviation and endorsed by the Economic Development (Official)Committee.100 per cent nationalisation4-.     To take the last of these courses first, the main arguments in favourof 100 per cent nationalisation are as follows -(a) This industry is heavily dependent upon Government orders and government money.     As the Plowden Committee recognised, 100 percent nationalisation would acknowledge the dominant role of theGovernment in the industry1s affairs.(b) With the industry wholly in public ownership the Government wouldnot be trammelled by obligations to the companies or to theirshareholders, and could pursue directly and without delay the objectives of rationalisation.     So long as there is any degreeof private ownership in the industry, there remains thepossibility of conflict of interest.(c) If the industry were wholly in public ownership, the need for detailed control and supervision of projects by the Ministry of aviation would be lessened.5.     The counter-arguments to these are as follows -(a)   Dependence on Government orders and money is not by itself a con-clusive argument for 100 per cent nationalisation.     Theaero-engine industry&apos;s position in this respect is not greatlydifferent from that of the airframe industry;   but there we havenot sought any degree, let alone 100 per cent, of public ownership.Moreover, the airframe industry is, for the next ten years at anyrate, an industry that must decline and may well during that timehave difficulty in paying its way.     It is questionable whether weshould want, in political terms, to take over an industry withthis prospect, or indeed to assume direct responsibility for theredundancies and write-offs that might well be entailed.     indeed it could well be easier for the board of a predominantly privateenterprise company to carry through the process of rationalisation,and to be tough where toughness was called for, than for the boardof a public corporation, which would be exposed to certainpressures by virtue of being a public corporation.
-3-(b) The risk of conflict of interest, at any rate on any major issueof policy, -would be more serious if our objective was to maintain a larger capacity than the forecasts of demand would justify.     Onthe contrary, our aim is to see the industry trimmed to a shape and size which bear a reasonable relation to probable demands upon it.     We want to see an industry that is not only technically butalso commercially efficient.     Commercial disciplines andexpertise will become, more, not less, important, as we run into aperiod when military demands will be considerably reduced and theindustry&apos;s position will depend to a greater extent on its success in achieving sales in the civil aircraft market.(c) Given the requirements of control of public expenditure and ofaccountability to Parliament for departmental expenditure on theindustry&apos;s product, a considerable measure of detailed financialand technical control of projects will probably continue to berequired, whether the industry is organised as a public corporation or as a private enterprise company (with or without government participation).     Mr. Aubrey Jones, in his reservation to the plowden Report, thought it unlikely that Government participation in ownership would reduce the need for detailed control.     our best safeguard here is not participation in ownership but efficiency of management,*     There are moreover certain other arguments which seem to tell against00 per cent nationalisation -(a)   100 per cent nationalisation is not a condition of efficiency of management.     In our earlier discussions it has been argued thatit would be advantageous not only to keep the existing management of HSA but also to bring the airframe activities of BAC under thatmanagement, since many who have some knowledge of the industrybelieve that the HSA management would be both tough and efficient.There seems, however/ to be some doubt whether the existing HSAmanagement would be available to a 100 per cent publicly-ownedcorporation.     We could certainly find a management for such a corporation;   it is not so certain that we could find a managementthat was sufficiently tough, efficient and&apos; experienced in the workand problems of the aircraft industry.
(b) There could also he international arguments against 100 per centnationalisation, although I am not competent to judge them.   the airframe industry is not just selling to British airlines butessentially depends on its ability to compete in the internationalmarket.   It is sometimes stated that public corporations are at a disadvantage in meeting the competition of overseas privateenterprise in international markets.   Moreover, we see continuingEuropean co-operation as an important element in the future of ourown industry, either in the form of co-operation on particularprojects between national firms, on tho lines of Concord, or of theformation of international companies.   International co-operation on these lines demands a good deal of flexibility.   It might be argued that it would be less easy for a public corporation than fora mixed enterprise to engage in this sort of co-operation, andthat the need to promote European co-operation is itself a reasonfor preferring a mixed enterprise structure in our own airframeindustry.(c) We must reckon that, while BAC would not oppose nationalisation of1their airframe interests, HSA would be likely publicly andvigorously to oppose nationalisation.   Apart from wider political implications, this would adversely affect the detailed negotiations with would have to precede nationalisation and would no doubt be reflected in the price HSA sought for their assets.(d) Generally, the airframe industry is not a self-evident case for100 per cent nationalisation.   It cannot be said to be one of the&quot;commanding heights&quot; of the economy.Majority Government shareholding7.     The majority of the Plowden Committee favoured a partnership between public and private enterprise in the airframe industry, but felt that over half the equity of a merged airframe company should be in Government ownership,if the purpose was to be achieved of &quot;foregoing detailed and technical control by the Ministry of Aviation&quot;.     In the earlier Ministerial discussions(MISC 96) it was suggested that a majority interest was the minimum to besought.     There was perhaps some implication at that time that a majorityholding might be less controversial than 100 per cent nationalisation;subsequent inquiries suggest that it would be little or no less controversial.8.     The Minister of Aviation has argued (ED(66) 71, paragraph 15) thatthere would be little or no merit for the Government in a majorityshareholding.     As he said, vre should be saddled with the greater part ofthe expense;   and, while we should be widely regarded as having completeresponsibility and would incur all the odium for unpleasant decisions, our-ii.-
control and our power to run the industry with an eye purely to our own view of the requirements of long-term efficiency would be fettered bythe existence of and obligations to the minority interests.     this solution would give us less than the advantages of 100 per centnationalisation, with many of its disadvantages and others as well.9.       In any case majority shareholding would be practicable only withthe agreement and co-operation of the industry.     It is clear thatthat would not be forthcoming.Minority Government shareholding10.     We are told that the shareholders of BAC are not interested ingoing into partnership with the Government:    they insist on 100 per centGovernment ownership or nothing, with a preference (I understand) forthe former.     HSA, on the other hand, would accept a minorityGovernment shareholding, though they would be apprehensive of competing with a wholly Government-ovmed BAC.     This has led to the thought thatthe Government should take over the entire shareholding of BAC, andthen convert this 100 per cent holding of BAC into a minority holding in a new company formed by merger with HSA.11.     It might not be possible to rely solely on the size of theGovernment holding in the new company and on Government nominations tothe board of directors to ensure the degree of influence on managementthat we should want to retain, since the majority interest would presumably he held not direct by private shareholders but by hawker siddeley.     We might well need, therefore, to negotiate special rights for the Government-held shares:    these might include a power of veto forthe Government nominees on the board on such matters as seniorappointments, raising of new capital and major changes in policy.12.     The main advantage   of a scheme on these lines (apart from thefact that it would cost the Government much less) would be that inthis way, and perhaps only in this way, the existing management ofHSA could be put in charge of the rationalisation of the industry,and of its subsequent direction.     From what we have been told aboutthe industryTs reactions there seems to be some prospect of being ableto negotiate an agreed solution on these lines with the industry.The Government would have a substantial stake in the industry, and theright and power to exercise some influence over policy, but should beless exposed to the sort of political pressures to which they would be liable if they owned the whole or the majority of the shares.     At thesame time the company would still be exposed to commercial disciplines,and would operate in international markets as a commercial concern.mCONFIDENTIAL
It would not be exposed to domestic competition;   but there has in any casebeen only a modified kind of competition between BAC and HSA, at a timewhen the placing of Government orders has been heavily influenced by theneed in practice to divide orders between the two companies so as to keepboth going.     The competitive spur to efficiency would come, as with the rolls-Bristol aero-engine merger, from overseas industry in internationalmarkets.13.   The disadvantages of this arrangement would be that the Government&apos;sinfluence on the policy of the industry would be more limited than under either of the other arrangements;   and that it would not obviate the needfor close financial and technical project control.     There is also thepolitical objection that it would look odd for us to take BAC into public ownership and then hand it back to private enterprise.14.   These objections do not seem to be decisive.     A minority shareholding,possibly supported By special rights on the lines suggested in paragraph 11,should give us the measure of influence that we needed, provided that wehad confidence in the management of the company.     I have already drawn attention (in paragraph 5(c) above) to the point that it is unlikely thatGovernment participation in ownership would reduce the need for detailedcontrol.     In practice it might well make little difference from this pointof view whether the industry was wholly or partly owned by the Government,or whether a part holding was a majority or a minority share of the equity.Again, it is efficiency of management rather than the precise degree of ownership that is significant from this point of view.15.   No doubt we should meet some political criticism for taking over BACand then converting our holding into a minority holding in the new company.If we accept, however, that HSA would oppose, and not co-operate in,100 per cent nationalisation, but would co-operate in a &quot;mixed&quot; enterpriseon these lines if we decided that this would be the best,form of reorganisation in the circumstances, it should be possible to present itpositively and constructively, as a scheme of modernisation and rationalisation-tion, consistent with the Plowden recommendation and likely to reap theadvantages which the Plowden Committee expected to flow from the irrecommendation, in which the Government were co-operating with privateenterprise to develop an efficient industry in the national interest.     as was suggested at the meeting of the Ministerial Committee on economic development, this &quot;could prove to be a useful precedent, like Eairfields,for measures of rationalisation in which private enterprise and Governmentco-operated and shared responsibility&quot;.-6-
CONCLUSION16.   I had completed this memorandum by the time I received my copy of theMinister of Aviation&apos;s memorandum of 29th September (Append&amp;3i a).     Theconclusion which I had reached, after re-reading all the previous papers,was that the balance of the argument came down in favour of taking over BACand merging it with HSA in a new company in which the Government shareholdingof BAC would represent a substantial minority holding.     Though the Ministercomes to a different conclusion, I still incline to my original view, for reasons which I hope I have made clear;   I am therefore circulating thismemorandum in the hope that it will help my colleagues, in thinking aboutand discussing the problem, to have this somewhat different assessment beforethem as well as the note by officials attached to the Minister&apos;s memorandum.C.A.R.department of Education and Science,30th September, 1966I i
