DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 178 COPY NO,8th December, 1966CABINETAGRICULTURAL, POLICY:  BACON industry memorandum by the Minister without PortfolioI have to ask the Cabinet to resolve a difference of view whichhas arisen in the Ministerial Committee on Agricultural Policy abouta proposal by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for ascheme of temporary assistance to the bacon industry.The problem.       During the present financial year the price which curers havehad to pay for pigs has been so high that, even with very high prices for bacon, the curers have been incurring losses on such a scale that,in the Minister&apos;s view, if immediate assistance is not given some firmswill go out of business and others will cut back operations with a resul-ting fall in production which may v/ell be as great as 20 per cent belowrecent levels.     The Minister argues that the cut-back in production would not be made good for a long time, if at all, and the result v/ould be higher prices for imported bacon and increased dependence on imported supplies.    He estimates that this might mean additionalbalance of payments costs of some  16 million a year (though some doubts were expressed in the Committee&apos;s discussion whether theadditional cost would be as high as this).     Moreover higher baconprices would be a serious matter from the point of view of prices and incomes policy during the period of severe restrain^3.       The Committee were generally agreed that the long-termsolution is an increase in the supply of pigs.    In view of the seriousdownswing in the size of the breeding Iierd, the Government announced in September that they intended at the next Farm Price Review to raisethe level of the middle band in the flexible guarantee arrangements for pigs by 400,000,     But this announcement has not so far led to any improvement in the position and in the Minister1 s view a principalreason for the delay in recovery is the uncertainty which pig producersfeel about the future of the bacon industry as a continuing outlet for pigs;  the breaking of contracts by bacon factories, which is all toolikely to follow a refusal of assistance, would be a disastrous blow to confidence,,confidential
The Minister &apos;s Proposal40       To meet the immediate problems of the curers, the Ministerproposes a scheme for Exchequer advances to them to reimburse atleast a substantial part of their losses during the remainder of thefatstock year - i, e, up to end March, 1967, when the situation would fall to be further examined in the light of the Farm Price Review.It is estimated that the total losses over this period would amountto about  1 million.    The advances would be repayable by meansof a levy on the curing industry imposed when curers were againmaking profits.    Details of the scheme are set out in the annex.Legislation would be needed, though payment of the advances could being straightaway, if it were decided to use the Appropriation Actfor the purpose.     The possibility of incorporating the necessary provision in the present Agriculture Bill should be examined,5,       In the Committee&apos;s discussion it v/as agreed that the industryfaced a real problem in the short term, but that there was also anargent need for more fundamental measures to secure greater efficiency in the longer term.    The scheme proposed by the minister would not and was not intended to impinge on the long-term problemsof the industry and the Committee therefore agreed that a smallindependent enquiry should be appointed forthwith to examine thescope for increased efficiency in pig manufacturing and especiallybacon curing.The Treasury&apos;s Views6.       The Chief Secretary, Treasury, while not ruling out entirelya scheme on the lines proposed if experience between now and Januaryconfirmed the need for it, did not agree that the present situation v/assufficiently serious to justify going ahead now.    His reasons v/ere -(1)     The curers&apos; present difficulties were likely to be temporary;last year they had made excellent profits.     They were unlikely to take decisions to reduce productive capacity on the basis ofprospects between now and next March.     There might well be some improvement in confidence after Christmas.    If mean-while some of the many small firms concerned decided to go out of business, this would only strengthen the structure ofthe industry.(2)     The proposed scheme was a significant departure in that for thefirst time it extended Government assistance beyond the field of food production into food processing.     This would open the door to pressure for similar assistance every time any sectionof the process industry ran into temporary difficulties.    TheGovernment would not be justified in incurring this risk inorder to meet a temporary difficulty.The Chief Secretary therefore contended that we should review thesituation again in January,
7.       The Minister of Agriculture however considered that to postponeaction until January would be leaving it too late to avert a reduction incapacity with the consequences he had indicated for bacon prices and balance of payments costs.    In this he had the support of the majorityof the Committee.conclusion.      I invite the Cabinet to decide whether a scheme of temporaryadvances to bacon curing firms on the lines set out in the annex shouldbe announced and introduced forthwith and the necessary legislationbrought forward as soon as practicable thereafter.D.H.70, Whitehall, S.W. 1.8th December, 1966-3-
CONFIDENTIAL ,        ^ 3 gANNEXA Scheme for Temporary Advances to Bacon Curers1, Advances from the Exchequer would be made to bacon curersin order temporarily to make up at least part of the losses sustained in continuing to produce bacon.2. The scheme would cover the period from now until end-I/Iarch,1967.Rate of advances3.       The rate of advance would be determined by comparing on theone hand the price realised for bacon (including the price realised foroffals) less the cost of curing, and on the other the cost to curers of buying pigs.    If this comparison showed a loss to the curers, an advance would be made at a rate to cover that loss or a predeterminedpart of it.4,       Since some elements in this calculation, notably the price ofbacon and the level of the guarantee payment (v/hich affects the net cost to the curer of buying pigs on contract), may vary weekly, the1rate of advance would need to be calculated each week.Eligibility for advances5.       The advances, so calculated, would be paid on the weight ofbacon (whether of Wiltshire or other types) produced by each factory,6.       A limit would be set for each factory on the total weight of baconin respect of which it might receive advances.     The limit would be related to the quantity of bacon produced by the factory in recent months.There is little risk in practice that the advances would enable baconproduction to be increased above recent levels;  but this provision forlimitation would be essential in order to avoid criticism from other users of pigs at home and our overseas suppliers of bacon.Payments7.       Advances, at the weekly rates determined and subject to the quota limitation, would be made on the basis of claims specifying thequantity of bacon produced each week and supported by auditors&apos; cer-certificates.     The books of factories would be open to official auditinspection.Repayments8.       The total sum so advanced would be recovered by levy on thecuring industry in circumstances when the industry was making profitson bacon.    In other words, when the comparison in paragraph (3) aboveshowed a profit to curers a levy would become payable on the quantity ofbacon produced, and would continue to be collected until the whole of thesum advanced had been recovered.
