W.l.25th November, 1966
MANDATORY SANCTIONS AGAINST RHODESIABackgroundOn 13th September the Prime Minister, in accordance with theCabinet decision of 10th September (CC(66) 45th Conclusions), circulated on a restricted basis at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos;    vConference a written statement that &quot;the British Government, given an assurance of the full support of Commonwealth representatives at theUnited Nations for the proposals that follow, will be prepared to agreeto the passage by the Security Council of the United Nations of Resolutionsunder Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations providing formandatory sanctions on certain selected exports from Rhodesia and,perhaps at a somewhat later stage, on the import of oil into Rhodesia viaMozambique&quot;.2.      In considering how best to implement this undertaking, theMinisters primarily concerned had the following considerations in mind:-(i) The sanctions chosen should cause the maximum economic damage to the illegal regime in Rhodesia, subject to(ii) the need to safeguard the economic interests of neighbouringn  friendly countries in Southern Africa, such as Zambia, Malawiand Botswana.    (For example, a ban on Rhodesian coal exports would affect Zambia1 s copper output and therefore her economy.If the United Kingdom were to be deprived of Zambian copperthis would have grave effects on the United Kingdom balance ofpayments);(iii) The sanctions must be sufficiently credible to preserve theexistence of the multi-racial Commonwealth.(iv) The United Kingdom in its own interests must avoid being drawn into direct economic confrontation with South Africa, since thiswould have a most serious effect on the British economy andjeopardise our economic recovery,    (An analysis of the issues involved for us in such a confrontation is attached as Annex Ato this paper).Sanctions on Selected Rhodesian Exports3.      Ministers agreed that the proposed Security Council Resolution,which Britain would co- sponsor, providing for mandatory sanctions on certain selected exports from Rhodesia, should cover asbestos, iron ore,chrome, pig-iron, sugar, tobacco, copper, meat and meat products,hides and skins and leather originating in Southern Rhodesia and exported from there,4.      In view of the possibility that British motor vehicle plants in rhodesia (which are owned by subsidiaries of British motor-carmanufacturers) may be used for the assembly of foreign cars, ministers have considered whether to include in the proposed Resolution a sanctionon the export by foreign manufacturing countries of assembly parts forRhodesia.    They are agreed that the need for this does not arise at this-1-
stage, but that a sanction on these lines should be held in reserve; andthat meanwhile v/e should seek assurances from the British motor-carmanufacturers who have invested in plant in Rhodesia that they willreject any proposal by their Rhodesian subsidiaries to assemble motor vehicles manufactured in a country other than the United Kingdom;  andthat in the light of the result of these approaches the Canadian government might be asked to take similar action to prevent foreign cars beingassembled by Fords, Canada at their assembly plant in Salisbury.    TheTreasury are also considering whether the existing exchange controlpowers could be used effectively to prevent the British motor-carmanufacturers concerned from selling or giving up control of theirRhodesian investments to a non-resident of the United Kingdom, andwhether it would be necessary for the existing exchange control powersto be supplemented by an Order in Council.    It is also proposed to seekassurances from the Governments of countries with substantial motorindustries that they will not permit their manufacturers to enter into licensing agreement for the assembly of their motor vehicles by aRhodesian subsidiary of a British or Canadian company if such anarrangement had been legally rejected by the firm&apos;s head office;  or takeover any of the existing British assembly plants in Rhodesia if these hadbeen compulsorily and illegally acquired by the regime;  or establish newvehicle assembly plants in Rhodesia while the United Nations is seizedof the Rhodesian problem.    (The Canadian Government will be asked totake similar action).    If, contrary to our expectations, any Governmentwere not prepared to give satisfactory assurances, the United KingdomGovernment should then consider in consultation with the canadian government the issues involved, with particular reference to the risk of confrontation with South Africa resulting from a mandatory resolution calling upon all states to prevent capital transfers to Rhodesia or prohibit the export to Rhodesia of motor vehicle components and assembly plant.5.       Consideration has likewise been given to the possibility of a mandatory sanction on new investments in Rhodesia.    This would present no difficulties for the United Kingdom since all capital transactions withRhodesia have already been stopped.    But it would only be effective if all the United Nations Member States operated a comprehensive exchange control system.    This is far from being the case and the cost of runninga comprehensive Exchange Control machine to prevent a certain class ofpayments to Rhodesia might well seem to the Governments concerned outof proportion to the benefits to be expected from the sanctions.South Africa, Switzerland and Portugal could not be expected to co-operate in such a sanction.    This would provide a large loophole, even if all othercountries co-operated.Oil Sanctions6.       The proposal for a limited embargo on oil supplies for Rhodesiathrough Mozambique was discussed early in November with theUnited States Government and certain other friendly foreign and commonwealth powers.    Their replies showed a general misgivingabout the inclusion in our Resolution of oil sanctions confined toMozambique.    The United States Government doubted if we would keepthe Afro-Asians with us even initially on such a limited basis.    TheNetherlands Government thought there was no possibility that the security council would rest content with the limitation of oil sanctions to-2-
Mozambique, and the Canadian Government suggested that a limited oil sanction might be almost as unacceptable to the Afro-Asians, and others,as no reference at all to oil sanctions.    The New Zealand Governmentsuggested that confining the oil sanctions to Mozambique would beneedlessly provocative to the Afro-Asians.    Lord Caradon, who was alsoconsulted, reiterated his previous advice that there would be no hope of getting agreement at the Security Council for such a limited oil embargo.7.      In the light of these replies, the Ministers primarily concernedagreed on 8th November that whether we proposed a Resolution limitedto the import of oil to Rhodesia through Mozambique in the first place,or made no mention of oil at all, there was bound to be strong pressure for a general oil sanction and a strong possibility that we should inconsequence to faced in the Security Council with an amendment to makethe Resolution applicable to supplies of oil to Rhodesia from all sources.Accordingly, Ministers agreed that in order to secure Africanco-operation at the Security Council, the best procedure would be todiscuss our proposals on oil in the first instance with Presidents Kenyattaand Obote, Colonel Gowan in Lagos and General Ankrah in Accra.Mr. Malcolm MacDonald was instructed to undertake these discussions.8.      Mr. MacDonald has since reported that these African statesmenconsider it essential to have a mandatory embargo on oil supplies to rhodesia and that it should not be limited to oil going to Rhodesia throughMozambique.    On 21st November Ministers agreed that we should not succeed in limiting an oil embargo against Rhodesia to Mozambique andshould be prepared to accept a general oil embargo although we need not commit ourselves at this stage to sponsor this.    The most satisfactory way of bringing such an embargo into effect would be by way of an amendment to the Resolution (copy at Annex B) which we shall become-sponsoring on selected exports from Rhodesia.    A separateresolution on oil might in its preamble and its recommendation to non-member states set dangerous precedents, from the United Nationspoint of view, which we have devoted much care to avoiding in our present draft on selected exports.9.       It is suggested that the ideal wording of such an amendment to ourResolution would be one which called upon member states to prevent&quot;the participation by their nationals or vessels under their registration in the supply of oil and oil products to Rhodesia&quot;.    This wording avoidspointing the finger specifically at Portugal and South Africa, though itbites on them.    Compliance by the oil business is ensured by placing the onus on the home governments of companies and others supplying oil.At the same time - and this is of basic importance to the security of oil supplies in general - we avoid establishing a precedent that oil producingstates might have the right to control the destination of oil exported bythe companies.    The Minister of State for Commonwealth Affair sjiasbeen authorised to discuss with President Obote the possibility thatUganda might sponsor such an amendment, t10.      A final decision has yet to be taken as to whether our vitalreservation on oil sanctions - that we would on no account become involved in enforcement measures against South Africa - should be madeopenly at the United Nations or whether it should be a matter of confidential understanding between members of the Commonwealth.    Thismatter is under urgent examination in the light of the views expressed by our representatives in New York and Pretoria, and by-3-
Mr. Malcolm MacDonald, and it will also be discussed at meetings between senior British and American officials which are due to take placein Washington on 30th November and 1st December.    The critical natureof the question can be set out as follows.    A public statement wouldreassure the South Africans that we were not embarking on a course of confrontation against them; but it also might well be regarded by ourAfrican Commonwealth partners as giving public notice to South Africathat South Africa could defy the United Nations Resolution with impunity.On the other hand if we make no public statement in the United Nationsabout our ultimate intentions, the South African Government (and commercial organisations) could well conclude that the next step wouldbe a call for enforcement measures against South Africa, and could welldoubt our intention to avoid being drawn into enforcing these measures.This would not fail to have an immediately damaging effect on our commercial and economic interests in South Africa.    Finally, if we make no public statement now, it may be more difficult to resist escalation later.Summary11.       To sum up, in drawing up our proposals for economic sanctions against Rhodesia, Ministers have included measures which, thoughincreasing the effect of existing sanctions against the illegal regime - by applying them on a world-wide basis - ought to have little or no additionaladverse effect upon our own economy, since they comprise measureswhich we in Britain are already applying to the best of our ability on a voluntary basis; but mandatory sanctions will make it more difficult forother countries to trade with Rhodesia.    What we must avoid is thesituation in which mandatory sanctions escalate into enforcementmeasures which would bring us into direct confrontation with South Africa,since this could do disastrous damage to our own economy.-4-
ANNEX AEffect on the British economy of economicconfrontation with South africa.     The implications for Britain of full participation in economic sanctions would he very serious.   Whether or not we took the initiative in the United Nations we should be regarded by the South Africans as thechief cause of their difficulties, since these would spring from our policy towards Rhodesia.Exports2. .   South Africa is our fourth largest market, our exports andre-exports to which have risen from a level of about  150 million ayear in 1960-62 to  265 million (on a slightly different basis ofclassification) in 1965.   Our best estimate of South African government purchases   is that they are of the order of  30 million per annum *   Inthe private sector, South Africa is our largest market for woven cottonfabrics,   electrical machinery as a whole (including generating equipment,switchgear and telecommunications equipment), commercial vehicles andchassis   and engines.   She is one of our three largest markets for aconsiderable number of items including cotton yarn, tractors, motor cars,ships and boats, transport equipment as a whole, plastic materials,man-made fibre fabrics, tools, mechanical handling equipment, and machinetoolso   South Africa takes more than 10 per oent of our exports of railwayvehicles, commercial vehicles, chassis and engines, awitchgear, generatingequipment and woven fabrics.   She takes 10 per cent of our exports ofman-made fibre yarn and thread, and glass.   Engineering products accountedfor about one-third of our exports to South Africa in 1965, and many ofthese are individual rather than mass-produced goods which would bedifficult to divert to other markets.   The search for new markets formany other goods would, he difficult at a time when the exporters of othercountries would also be looking for alternatives to the South Africanmarket.Imports3. If supplies from South Africa were cut off, our import bill might increase by about  100 million because of pressure of demand on alternative sources of supply and the resulting rise in prices, particularly wool.Inconvenience, price increases and some dislocation v/ould be caused bythe cutting off of supplies from South Africa of certain essential rawmaterials and foodstuffs which could not be easily or satisfactorilyreplaced: the biggest single item (raw diamonds -  65 million per annum)
night be diverted from the British market with loss only to the UnitedKingdom.   The long-term effect on the United Kingdom Atomic energy authority and on the whole British nuclear energy industry of any interference with South African uranium supplies (for which we haveoutstanding our advance payment of  38 million) would be very seriousindeed.Invisible Incomek-.     We could also expect to lose something around  100 million annually of Invisible income.   Our investments in the Republic are estimatedat about  950 million producing an annual income of well over  60 million(about 10-12 per cent of total British earnings from investment overseasother, than oil).   We should lose this income and the investments themselves would be at risk.   The shipping contribution to the United Kingdom balanceof payments would be reduced by about  16 million a year.   The value ofshipping services directly concerned is of the order of  Lj milli on per annun;the interruption of existing shipping services also carries with it therisk that the trade contracts and local organisation upon which theydepend will be lost, and that the advantage which British companies atpresent enjoy would be lost irredeemiably.   An interruption of the air services would cause a loss to British airlines of some  6 million.We should also lose our earnings from oil, insurance, banking, tourism, etc.Balance of Payments and Unemployment5.     Our own balance of payments position is more vulnerable than whenthe possibility of sanctions against South Africa was considered (inthe context of Apartheid) 18 months ago.   The total loss to our balance ofpayments might be of the order of  300 million in the first year0   coupled with the effects on sterling of a cutting-off of the supply of monetarygold from South Africa, a loss of this order would do unacceptable further damage to Britain&apos;s economy and prospects.   The direct loss of a large part of our export trade would lead to redundancy in firms that could not readily find alternative markets.   About 13,000 British seafarers wouldbecome unemployed and the effect on shipbuilding and ancillary industries in particular could jeopardise as many as 15,000 jobs.   There would     tundoubtedly be hardship in the unemployment areas and in Northern Ireland.
Monetary Consequences6.    As a reserve currency country, the United Kingdom, like the UnitedStates, would almost certainly he affected by any fall in the sales ofSouth African gold resulting from a reduction in South African imports which are partly paid for by sales of gold (of which she is the source ofabout 70 per cent of the free worlds supply).   The pound as well asthe dollar could be seriously affected by the application of an embargoagainst South African gold.   Even if such an embargo did not effectivelyprevent South Africa from moving and disposing of gold, it would, set offspeculation in gold, and so reduce the amounts available for monetaryauthorities, and would be likely to reduce confidence in sterling inparticular.   It is impossible to predict how serious this might become.The Cold Pool arrangements at present operated by the Bank of Englandthrough the London market would be disrupted and there might be severepressure on the gold price.
