14th November, 1966CABINETHOUSING PROSPECTS-Memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentI have already given my views in PE(66) 13.    Since then, figuresfor September have become available and also the latest survey ofSpeculative Builders&apos; intentions.    These confirm the forecasts andanalyses then made.2.       It seems to me that the salient features of the situation are -(a) Unless action is taken now there is a considerable chance that no more than 400,000 houses will be completed in Great Britain in 1968.To do better than this, private builders will have to start more than190,000 houses in 1967.     There can be no csrtainty of this since they expect to start only 180, 000,(b) If this should happen, i. e, 180,000 starts only, completions in our first four years of office compared with the last year of the previous government would be:1964 - 374,0001965 382,0001966 - 380,0001967 - 396, 000 to 406,0001968 &apos;       - 390,0003.       There is a strong demand for new houses for owner occupation.The check to private building has so far not been caused by lack ofcustomers but by the inability of potential customers to get mortgages.Building Societies have been rationing their advances for some considerable time and when local authorities resumed lending on an appreciable arssa-ite early this summer, the demand upon them for mortgageswas heavier than anyone expected (the Greater London Council havealready almost exhausted their quota for the whole of the financial year).4.       As long as demand is so strong, the major uncertainty affectingthe housing programme is the future course of the Governments economic policies, since these determine the availability of money for lending.If there is general reflation or if movements in interest rates make theBuilding Societies investment rate relatively more attractive, building societies are likely to attract more funds and so be able to lend on alarger scale.    In the absence of general reflation, if measures of selective reflation released funds to finance mortgages, we might getthe same result.    Until one of these happens, private house buildingDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)68C(66) 168 COPY NO. -_
will continue at about its present depressed level.    In the interim wemust have the increased public sector building programme for which Iam asking to keep house building at a level which makes our pledgescredible.5.       The Public Expenditure Committee (paragraph 21 of their report annexed to C(66) 158) propose that the option mortgage scheme for newborrowers be postponed from October, 1967, when it could be broughtinto operation to 1st April, 1968.    The saving would only be  1, 5 million, but the political consequences of yet further delay in proposalsoriginally made in our 1964 campaign will be serious.    So indeed will the effect on the confidence of private builders.6,       I cannot, therefore, accept the Chancellor^ proposal inC(66) 158 that a decision on my request be postponed, since unless adecision is made now the houses will not be completed in 1968.    i therefore ask my colleagues to agree to  35 million additional invest-ment in local authority and New Town housing in England and Wales in1967-68 and to the introduction of option mortgages for new borrowersin October, 1967.A.G.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S. W, 1.14th November, 1966
