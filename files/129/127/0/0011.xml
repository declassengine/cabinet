IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENT)C(66)1528th November, 1966COPY NO.  67CABINETLjOCAL AUTHORITY CURRENT EXPENDITURE(ENGLAND AND WALES) 1967/68 AND 1968/69Memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerDiscussions with local authorities about the level of rate support Grant in 1967/68 and 1968/69 are scheduled to begin at theend of this week, and cannot be delayed if the Affirmative resolution is to be obtained for the Rate Support Grant Order before the christmas Recess.    It would in fact be possible to lay the Orderbefore the Recess and debate it after.    But if it involves substantial reductions in the expenditure estimates which local authorities have put forward, and it lies on the Table throughout the Recess, it willenable a considerable volume of opposition to it to become mobilisedand we shall face a much more difficult debate afterwards.2.       The discussions with local authorities will centre on the amountof current expenditure which we are prepared to approve for grantpurposes in these years.     The attached paper sets out the estimatessubmitted by local authorities, together with proposals for limitingthis expenditure.    In summary, the main figures are:-  million(mid-1966 prices)1965/66 (actual)1966/671967/681968/69As submitted2,196 (100)2,427 (110, 5)2, 651 (120. 7)2, 817 (128, 3)As revisedby Departments2,196 (100)(not available)2, 524 (114. 9)2, 677 (121. 9)Further reducedby 30 m.

3. The estimates as revised by Departments allow for expenditureon the main services as follows:-  million1967/68 1968/69Education	1, 377	1,457JLocal Health and Yifelfare	174	188Police	164	170Fire Service, Courts and other Home		Office services	132	136Roads and Lighting	201	218Miscellaneous Environmental Services	476	508Total	2,524	2,6774.      It is proposed that the estimates for Miscellaneous Environmen-tal Services should be further reduced by  30 million in 1967/68 and 45 million in 1968/69.    Any such reductions will of course enable usto limit the restrictions on the remainder of public expenditure in these years.    But local authority expenditure has been rising faster than expected and, even with these reductions, their expenditure in 1967/68would be some  22 million higher than that in the basic public expenditure programmes.     (Further reductions in specific services are referred to in paragraph 8 of the attached paper, but these canbe considered separately).ii5.       The Committee on Public Expenditure are agreed that officials should be instructed to open discussions with the local authorities on the basis that these further reductions should be made.     Thiswill mean adopting a very tough attitude in these negotiations and cabinet approval is sought accordingly.L, J. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.8th November, 1966
LOCAL. AUTHORITY CURRENT. EXPENDITURE (ENGLAND AND WALES):Departments are now concluding their examination of theestimates of current expenditure which local authorities have submitted for the purpose of determining the Rate Support Grant,etco in 1967-68 and. 1968-69*    The results are most disturbing.These figures are for England and Wales only:    the Scottish figures are not yet available,    (All the figures in this paper are at mid-1966 prices,)1?JL7^682.     In our Public Expenditure figures last year we allowed for current expenditure by local authorities in England and Wales toincrease from about  2,325 million in 1966-67 to  2,h50 million in1967-68,    In this year&apos;s figures we have already allowed for ahigher rate of spending by these local authorities -  2,350 million in 1966-67 rising by over 5 per cent,  to  2,472 million in 1967-68.The estimates now submitted by the local authorities themselves,however, amount to  2.651 million in 1967-68, representing a further 179 million (i,e, 7 per cent.) more than was included in thisyearfs basic Public Expenditure Survey figures.3.     The Departments concerned, in consultation with the Treasury,have examined the estimates submitted by local authorities, on thebasis that full allowance should be made for the continuedimplementation of any relevant Government policies, and that thevarious local authority services will continue to expand much asthey&apos;have in the past.    On this basis it is considered that thelocal authorities have over-estimated by some  127 million;    andthat it would be reasonable to seek to persuade them that their estimates should be adjusted accordingly.    However, this would still leave an excess over the PESC figures of  52 million for which there/ )is -at present no provision in any of the figures which the Committee Ihave considered.k&apos;     Most of this residual excess is due to the miscellaneousenvironmental services (sewerage, refuse col3.ection, parks, libraries,general administration and miscellaneous services) for which therate of growth of expenditure turned very sharply upwards in1965-66.   Expenditure in 1965-66 and 1966-67 was also above theestimates which have been used hitherto:    but this does not alter thefact, with which we are now faced, that proposed local authority expenditure in 1967-68 will be  52 million higher than was hithertothought,   &quot;
5c      In the circumstances with which we are dealing on public expenditure as a whole, we should ask Ministers to ensure thatreductions of  127 million of local authority estimates, proposedby Departments, are obtained in full;    but this is clearly not enough.6o      I propose, therefore, that the local authority estimates forthe Miscellaneous Environmental Services should be reduced by afurther  30 million in 1967-66.    This would be in addition tothe  127 million reduction for over-estimating and would reducethe excess over basic Public Expenditure figures from  52 million to  22 million.7-     Expenditure on the Miscellaneous Environmental Servicesincreased from  374 million in 1964-65 to  hi 1 million in 1 965-66 -an increase of 10 per cent.   A further substantial increase islikely in 1966-67, possibly to  450- -455 million.    The reductionwhich I propose would, limit this expenditure to  441 million in1967-68, and might therefore mean a reduction below the level ofactual expenditure in 1966-67.   But it would allow an average rateof growth on these services of about 3i per cent, per annum from1965-66 onwards, or of about 5i per cent starting from 1964-65&quot;8.     Some of the proposals which I put forward in PE(66)15 withthe purpose of limiting the increase in basic programmes will affectlocal authority expenditure.    In education, most of the increased charges, including those for school meals and milk, which I have proposed should apply from September next, would accrue to theiocal authorities and would reduce their net expenditure by 32 million (a subsequent adjustment for Rate Svpport Grant couldbe made in due course by reducing any additional amount payablebecause of increased prices).    Other reductions which I have proposed would reduce local authority expenditure by about million(mainly in roads, police and education) and this should be reflected in the amount of relevant expenditure for the Sate Support Grant,provided that decisions are taken and announced within the next month.9.     Similar considerations apply in respect of 1968-69.    Theestimates submitted by local authorities amount to  214 million morethan that included in the PESO basic figures.    In this year&apos;public Expenditure figures we have increased the allowance for localauthorities&apos; current expenditure in England and Wales in 1968-69  /&quot;)from  2,560 million to  2,603 million - i.e. over 5 per cent, higherthan for 1967-68.   But the estimates submitted by local authoritiesamount to  2,817 million, representing a further addition of 214 million (8 per cent.).    It is considered that some  140 million of this results from over-estimating;    but this still leaves anexcess of  74 million over basic Public Expenditure figures.    Ipropose, therefore, that the estimates of expenditure on the miscellaneous Environmental Services in 1968-69 should, be further reduced by  45 million.    This would still allow expenditure on these particular services to rise by 3i-4 pen cent, compared with 1967-68,to  458 million in 1968-69$    and it would reduce the overall excess over the Public Expenditure figures from  74 million to  29 million.The other reductions will, of course, also help with this year.1968-692.
10.    I realise that this must &quot;be unpalatable.    But, as I suggestedin PE(66)15, paragraph 1k, and emphasised at our discussion on the2kth October, we cannot allow local authorities to pre-emptresources with excessive increases in expenditure, particularly of a kind over which we have no control.    Though the local authoritiesestimates of relevant expenditure are examined service by service,the Rate Support Grant itself helps to meet expenditure as a whole:it is not allocated to particular services.    Thus by reducing thetotal amount of expenditure which we approve for grant, we make clear to them the need for economy across the whole field.    Of course, ifthey will not or cannot achieve this economy, they will say that wehave forced them to raise.their rates.    But in the circumstanceswith which we are now dealing, local authorities, like everybodyelse, must be invited to slow down their rate of growth.f
