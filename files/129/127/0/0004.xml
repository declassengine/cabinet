THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY AND THEPOST OFFICE PROCUREMENT PQlJTcYMemorandum by the Minister of Technology andthe Postmaster GeneralThe Ministry of Technology ap  fee sponsoring Department hasthe task of fostering the technological and economic development of the telecommunications industry.    The Post Office is the industry!s maincustomers taking more than half its total output.    Both Departmentstherefore have a direct interest in matters concerning the manufacture and supply of telecommunications products of all kinds.    Last year theindustry!s output exceeded  100 million,2.       The United Kingdom has for long been the leading exporting country.    About one third of the industry8s output is exported but our share of world trade has been declining (see the graph at Annex II).The reasons for this trend are complex,3.       The two Departments have under discussion a number of matters arising from their respective interests in the industry, particularly theway in which the purchasing policies of the Post Office affect the technological advance of the industry and its competitiveness in world markets.    Both accept that the possibility of some sort of joint research and development organisation, bringing together the Post Office andindustry, should be further studied.    The Ministry of Technologyregards the working out of satisfactory arrangements of this kind as of fundamental importance to the future well-being of the industry.    On the procurement of exchange and transmission equipment there aredifferences of emphasis between the two Departments on the way inwhich competitive purchasing could be used to secure rationalisation of manufacture.    These matters are still being explored.    Meanwhiletransmission equipment will continue to be bought competitively and theBulk Supply Agreement (BSA) for exchange equipment will not be renewed in March, 1968, being replaced by a series of contracts to be negotiated with the manufacturers which will be as competitive as circumstances in this highly specialised field allow.    But we are unableto agree what procedures should replace the present BSA for telephonesubscribers1 apparatus, which also expires in March, 1968, and whichlast year accounted for   14 million of Post Office expenditure,4,       The BSA&apos;s have a long history, and have frequently been attacked by Parliamentary committees and other bodies.    The PostOffice has already announced that it will not renew the agreement forapparatus after March, 1968.    Instead it proposes to use competitivebuying and in doing so will aim to bring about rationalisation of the-1-IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 145 COPY NO jj725th October,, 1966CABINET
-2-industry, taking advantage of economies of scale.    The Post office would avoid the risk of a monopoly and would be prepared to placecontracts with new firms having expertise in new techniques.    Theintention would be to announce this change of policy forthwith.5,     The Ministry of Technology sees the need for a government policy positively designed to rationalise the industry.    In the case of apparatus the Ministry proposes the formation of a joint productionunit with ownership and management shared between the Post Officeand industry.    It recognises that this may not be possible before theBSA expires in March, 1968.    Some interim arrangements would inthat case be necessary and in view of the Post Officers intention to usecompetition to escure rationalisation, it regards the Post Office proposals in paragraph 4 above as an acceptable interim step0    Nevertheless theMinistry regards it as essential that its longer term objective should beaccepted in this field.    If this is agreed it would be eBfietxi&amp;B.l to amplifythe Post Office announcement in paragraph 4 in order to make it clear to the industry that their proposal was an interim one pending theworking out of alternative arrangements.6.     The Ministry of Technology proposal is set out in more detail in Annex I, together with comments by the two Departments.Conclusion70     It is urgently necessary to decide the purchasing policy toreplace the existing BSA apparatus, having regard to the need to letindustry know where it stands, and to negotiate alternative arrange-ments.    There appear to be the following courses of actiong-(a) To adopt the line of action proposed by the PostOffice in paragraph 4 above,(b) To adopt the line of action proposed by the Ministryof Technology in paragraph 5 above.(c) If course (b) is adopted, we recommend that theMinistry of Technology&apos;s proposal be referred for urgent examination to an ad hoc official committee drawn from the Department of economic affairs, the Treasury, and the Board of Tradetogether with the Post Office and the Ministry of technology.A, W.

ANNEX ITelephone Subscribers* ApparatusGeneral1.     Subscribers&apos; telephone apparatus comprises mainly telephonesof various kinds, and private manual branch exchanges.2.     Under the existing Bulk Supply Agreement (BSA) (expiring on31st March, 1968) there are eight nominal suppliers, namely -Associated Electrical Industries (AEI)   1Automatic Telephones and Electric (ATE)Ericsson Telephones (ET)General Electric Company (G.C)PlesseyPhoenixStandard Telephones and Cables (STC)Telephone Manufacturing Company (TMC)Of these, ATE, ET and Plessey have amalgamated, Phoenix is owned by the big four (AEI, G.C, Plessey and STC) whilst TMC is controlled by the Pye Group.    The present BSA therefore effectively comprisesAEI, G.C, Plessey, STC and TMC,    These five manufacturers areguaranteed 75 per cent of Post Office orders.    The remaining25 per cent may be placed with any other firm who tenders competitively.3.      The number of telephones of all types ordered by the PostOffice for supply in 1966-67 is about one and a half million.    Theagreement firms also sell to other home market customers at the rateof about 30 per cent of their sales to the Post Office and export a likequantity.    The non-agreement firms have negligible export sales.The Ministry of Technology Proposal4.      The Ministry of Technology proposes that a single productionunit should be established, which would be jointly owned by the PostOffice and the five Companies now parties to the current agreement,to undertake the design and manufacture of subscribers1 apparatus.5.      The Ministry^ proposal is intended to secure the following advantages -(a) The maximum integration of the operating, marketing, design and production expertise of the Post Office and the manufacturers,(b) This is particularly important to put the iadufctsy in the strongest possible position to improve its exportperformance and to meet the competition in the home market to which it will shortly be exposed from EFTAand perhaps later from e.c..-3-CONF3DENTBAL
(c)    The maximum economy of scale.    Telephone apparatusand particularly telephone sets are ordered in quantitiesin which substantial economies of scale can be secured.Economy of manufacture is best obtained by concentratingas many of the processes as possible in a single locationto avoid transport and handling charges.    At presentfabrication of parts takes place in numerous separatelocations.6.     Comparison with experience abroad lends support to theproposal.    Two of the most efficient telephone administrations havearrangements not unlike that proposed.    In Sweden, the Post OfficeAdministration has a manufacturing department which suppliesapproximately half its needs and operates in a special relationship with industry which is basically competitive but does have regard tothe industry^ welfare.    In the USA the Bell System has an integratedmanufacturing unit, the Western Electric Co. , which undertakes theproduction of 7-9 million telephones a year in a single establishment.Post Office Comments on Ministry of Technology Proposal7.     The following are the Post Office comments on the MinistryJsproposals -(a) The Post Office must be assured of continuity of supply oftelecommunications equipment at a proper price and hasno confidence that this can be secured by the Ministry2sproposal.I(b) To create a consortium by taking over the industry!sexisting manufacturing facilities would not produce economies of scale or rationalisation,(c) On the other hand, to set up a new production unit would posethe problem of the provision of public cpaital and that ofthe closing down of existing factories, some of which arein development areas.(d) The Post Office has little or no know-how on commercialmanufacture and would have to rely entirely on theco-operation of the existing manufacturers, which wouldnot necessarily be forthcoming.(e) The competitive element would be entirely eliminated underthis proposal; it has not been established why theGovernments present policy of competitive buying shouldnot apply in this case.(f) The Post Office doubts the wisdom of separating theproduction of subscribers&apos; apparatus from the rest of the telecommunications industry, because the techniques and requirements are so closely knit.-4-CONFIDENTiAL
(g)    The efficiency of the Western Electric Co&apos;s productionunit in the USA is not disputed; but(1)   There are several other large manufacturers of telephone apparatus in the USA, providing a competitive environment.(2)   It is general experience that transfer to thiscountry of American practices and enterprisesdo not reproduce the same degree of efficiencyas in the country of origin,,8.     There may be a time when it would be appropriate for thePost Office to acquire production facilities for telephones, perhapsjointly with part of the industry, and to manufacture in competition with other suppliers, but this could not be until the process of rationalisation through competition ha;, made considerable headway.And to announce this at this stage would stultify the Post Office sshopes of improving efficiency by competition.-5-
