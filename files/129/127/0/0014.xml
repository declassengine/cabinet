DRAFT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME minister the position of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in relation to theEuropean Economic Community was stated in the Gracious Speech on21st April in these terms&quot;My Government will continue to promote the economic unity of Europe and to strengthen the links between the european free Trade Association and the European economic community.    They would be ready to enter the european economic Community provided essential British and commonwealth interests were safeguarded. &quot;This policy, which was itself a reaffirmation of that laid down in theLabour Party election manifesto has also been reaffirmed on many occasionin this House, in the country and abroad, notably in the speech ofmy rt. hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, then First Secretary, at stockholm on 6th May.On 21st April I informed the House that we had made certainMinisterial arrangements to ensure &quot;that any opportunities that do presentthemselves in Europe can be quickly seized upon so that they can beevaluated ....&quot;, and I said that it would be our intention &quot;to probe in avery positive sense the terms on which we would be able to enter theEuropean Economic Community and its related organisations&quot;.Sir, in recent weeks the Government has conducted a deep andsearching review of the whole problem of Britain&apos;s relations with the e.c.,including our existing special relationship with EFTA and the CommonwealtEvery aspect of the Treaty of Rome itself, of decisions taken subsequent to its signature, and all the implications and consequences which mightbe expected to flow from British entry, have been examined in depth.In the light of this review the Government has decided that a newhigh-level approach must now be made to see whether the conditions exist -or do not exist - for fruitful negotiations, and the basis on which such negotiations could take place.Sir, it is vital that we maintain the closest relations with our EFTAcolleagues.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government therefore now propose to invitethe Heads of Government of the EFTA countries to attend a conference inLondon it. the next few weeks to discuss the problems involved in a move to join the e.c..Following that conference my rt. hon. Friend the Foreign secretary and I intend to engage in a series of discussions with each of the Heads ofGovernment of the Six, for the purpose of establishing whether it appearslikely that essential British and Commonwealth interests could be safeguarded if Britain were to accept the Treaty of Rome and join e.c..In the light of these discussions the Government will then take its decision whether or not to activate the arrangements for negotiating for entry,and what the appropriate time for such negotiations would be.    The house will agree that - provided the right conditions for negotiations are-1-
established - it is vital that we should enter only when we have secured a healthy economy and a strong balance of payments, with the   standingfirm and high.    Commonwealth Governments, as well as EFTAGovernments have been informed and we shall maintain the closest degreeof consultation with them.Sir, I want the House, the country, and our friends abroad to know that the Government are approaching the discussions I have foreshadowedwith the clear intention and determination to enter e.c. if, as we hope,our essential British - and Commonwealth - interests can be safeguarded.We mean business.It will, of course, be our intention to keep the House as fully informed as is possible in the circumstances of the progress of our discussions.    If, as I would expect, there is a general desire in theHouse for a debate before these important meetings begin, my rt. hon.Friend the Leader of the House will be glad to arrange discussions throughthe usual channels to agree on a date which would meet the convenience of the House.
1 1 military X  )Draft Answer to Supplementary Question about theTreaty of RomeI recognise, as the Rt. Hon. Gentleman has stressed, theimportance of the question about our attitude to the Treaty of Romeitself.    The Government take the view that, while there are anxietieson this point, the Treaty of Rome is not in itself or necessarily animpediment.    There are anxieties, as I have saidj but the terms of theTreaty need not be an obstacle if our problems can be satisfactorilydealt with, whether through adaptations of the arrangements made underthe Treaty or in any other acceptable manner.    Perhaps I couldsummarise by saying that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be preparedto accept the Treaty of Rome, subject to the necessary adjustmentsconsequent on the accession of a new member and provided that we receive satisfaction on the points on which we see difficulty.-3-secret
