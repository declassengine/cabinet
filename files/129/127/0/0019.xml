FAMILY ENDOWMENT - SCHOOL MEALSMemorandum by the Lord President of the council the increase in school meal charges and abolition of free milk,which a majority of the Ministerial Committee on Public Expenditurefavoured, would hit the larger families particularly hard (although thechildren from the very poorest families would continue to get freeschool meals on a means test).    The relative position of the largerfamilies in the lower income groups has deteriorated since ]OK6, whileprices and other types of income have increased substantially.    I wouldbe most unwilling to agree to-this increase in charges except in the context of a thorough and satisfactory reform of family endowment.2.       The Report of the Official Committee on Social Services on family endowment (SS(66) 27) gives an account of several schemes.    Since a simple increase in family allowances large enough to make any significant impact on the position of the families with incomes below the supplementary Benefit level would be extremely expensive, the Reportconsiders various types of schemes which would concentrate the benefitthat might be given on the poorer families.3.       Several schemes are presented which involve means tests similarto that used for Supplementary Benefit.    I cannot accept that any such scheme would be a satisfactory way of dealing with the problem.    Our aimhas been to introduce reforms in the social security system that will reduce, not increase, the number of people who have to depend onbenefits subject to such means tests.    Introduction of a means testedbenefit for the families of wage earners in full-time employment, someof whom would be earning wages not very much below average industrialearnings, seems to me to be socially and politically intolerable.Moreover it would make it much more difficult to introduce to a sociallydesirable system later on.4.       The scheme which is undoubtedly the most desirable is thatoutlined in paragraphs 36 and 37 of the Official Committee&apos;s report.Family allowances would be increased by 10/- a week.    The benefit fromthis increase would be concentrated on families with low incomes (i. e.those paying no income tax and&apos;those paying tax at the reduced rates), by cutting income tax child allowances by  45 per annum for each child afterthe first.    This would leave standard rate income tax payers almost exactly as well off as they are at present (4d per week per child worse off).    The increase in family allowances would bring 57 per cent of the families, containing about 67 per cent of the children, who are now living-1-rHlS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)67C(66) 160 COPY NO. _11th November, 1966CABINET
below the Supplementary Benefit standard, up to or above that standard, andwould give substantial help to those who would still remain below it.    Thenet cost to the Exchequer would be about  30 million a year ( 45 million hithe first year, because only 5/6ths of the year&apos;s tax reaches theExchequer within the Financial Year.    Thus this reflationary impactwould come at the best possible moment).    This scheme would thus dealwith the major part of the problem of child poverty without using an unacceptable type of means test, and at a fairly moderate cost.5.      If one could view the proposals about school meals and milk aspart of a package which included a major reform of this kind in the field of family endowments it would be possible socially as well as politicallyto treat them as acceptable.    Presented without this reform or combined with a narrow means-tested assistance to the poorest families, theschool meals and milk proposals would be regarded as a betrayal of ouroften asserted claim that we have not cut back our social priorities duringthe deflation;  most important of all it would surely spell the end of anyincomes and prices policy.6.      I am aware that the problem of when we can introduce reforms of family endowment is complicated by the administrative difficulties of the inland Revenue.    Decisions, I gather, have to be taken immediately forany reform to be introduced next year.    Nevertheless I am told that adecision this week might still be just in time.    The choice, therefore,seems to me between (a) postponing any change in our family endowmentarrangements and dropping the proposals about school meals and milk and (b) making the saving on school meals and milk but combined with anunmeans-tested advance in family endowment.    I should have thought there could be no doubt where the preference should lie provided theadministrative difficulties could be overcome.R.H.S.C.Privy Council Office, S.W.I.11th November, 1966-2-
