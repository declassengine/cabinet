ItfIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HEP, BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 16111th November, 19 66CABINETSOCIAL, SECURITY BENEFITSNote by the Minister of Social security  v/ould like to put to my colleagues certain considerations affecting the programme for social security benefits, which I havealready brought to the attention of the Committee on public expenditure in the attached memorandum.M.H,Ministry of Social Security, W,. C. 2.11th November, 1966UCOPYING.
SOCIAL SECURITY benefits memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Social SecurityIt would he wrong to let my colleagues think that we could cut the social security programme as envisaged &quot;by the Chancellor of theExchequer Jm Pffi(fln)l5.2.     My programme assumed that social security &quot;benefits would heincreased next June.   By then, a rather longer interval wouldalready have elapsed between pension increases than at any time since19^11 and over 7s. might then be needed on the 80s. pension (andover 11s. on the married rate) merely to restore the real value thepresent rates had when we brought them in last year.   This show show far pensioners will actually have slipped back before we take further action.    The 1967 uprating allowed for in my basic programme looks expensive but tb:&quot; 3 reflects the extent to whichwe have already allowed the- pension to fall behind the rise in earnings.3.     There is another reason why we should not delay beyond next summer.33bne of us is likely to forget the storm of protest - not least from our own supporters - when we took eight ee:i weeks, from the date ofthe first announcement, to effect the last pension increases. Wewere hard put to it to defend ourselves even though we could, and did,lay much of the blame on the arrangements we had inherited from our predecessors.   But if we were to defer the next uprating untilmid-Uovember 1967? as        Chancellor&apos;s costings imply, it would be bound to take at least as long&apos; as last time from the firstannouncement - since the legislation would have to be passed beforeParliament rose in the summer - and I should be landed withan uprating time-table which, would be impossible to justify.4.     Vital though these issues of timing are they must not distractour attention from the amounts to be given.   As a result of what our predecessors did in their later years of office, and of what we ourselves have saidj people have come to expect that pensions will go up in the same proportion as earnings.   I have reluctantly agreedthat the increase calculated on this basis should be abated by 1s.to help finance the new scheme of supplementary benefits. To make a bigger cut would put the pensioners at a quite unfair disadvantage!and, on the Chancellor&apos;s own figures, his proposals would mean a cut of 4s. rather than 1s.   The standards for many of our old people are already low compared with those for the rest of the community.They must, not be pushed back still further.   It is not as thoughthe generality of pensioners have much besides their pensions.Prom my special survey of retirement pensioners last year, it appeared that the Isotal incomes of only about half the married couples reached -1.
 10 a week, i.e. exceeded the basic pension rate by  3 10s, ormore, while less than half the single men, and only about one-third of the single women, had even  2 a week above theirrate of basic pension.%     In 1946 we made a big increase in pensions and did nothing more until 1951&quot;   In 19^4 we again started with a big increase.We must not give the impression that history is beginning to repeat itself.M. H.Ministry of Social Security, W.C.2.28th October, 1966.
