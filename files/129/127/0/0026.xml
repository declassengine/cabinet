0C(66) 167 COPY NO.14th November, 1966CABINEr.DRAFT WHITE PAPER ON PRICES AND INCOMES CRITERIADURING THE PERIOD OF SEVERE RESTRAINTMemorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretary ofState for Economic affairs as I reported to the Cabinet on Thursday, 10th November,discussions with the Confederation of British Industry (CBL) and TradesUnion Congress (TUC) on the draft White Paper setting out the criteria for prices and incomes during the period of severe restraint have proved difficult.    There were signs on both sides of a desire&apos; to minimise the role of the Government in securing the application of the criteria to individual cases, particularly in respect of claims and proposals for increased pay.    I have now had further discussions withMr. Davies of the CBI and Mr. Woodcock of the TUC as a result ofwhich I now feel more confident that we can secure a wide measure ofagreement about the national need for exceptional restraint although itis clear that we shall not be able to carry the two bodies to the point ofwholly endorsing the criteria.      The principal objectives which I havehad in mind in these discussions have been:-(a) To involve the CBI and the TUC in securing observations of the criteria for securing restraint.(b) At the same time to ensure that the involvement of the CBI andTUC does not unduly diminish the role of the Government.(c) To secure that the White Paper, even if not wholly endorsed,is not wholly rejected by either the CBI or the TUC.2,      As a result of my further discussions the area of difference hasbeen considerably reduced.    The revised draft of the White Paper,annexed, reflects the progress made in these discussions as well aspoints made by my colleagues at the Prices and Incomes Committeeon 7th November and the Cabinet on Thursday, 10th November(CC(66) 56th Conclusions),3.       The main points outstanding are the following:-(i) Public Service Pay, This is discussed in a separate memoran-dum (C(66) 156).(ii)  Private Sector Salaries.    There is still a difficult issue overstanding commitments to review pay and salary increases which havebeen deferred under the standstill.    It was stated in Cmnd, 3073 thatthe standstill would not interfere with normal arrangements for is DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY TS GOVERNMENT)
Department of Economic Affairs, S.W.1,14th November, 1966increasing pay &quot;by means of regular increments of specified amountswithin a pr e-determined range or scale&quot;.     The effect of this rule, whichwas devised in order to maintain a clear dividing line between regularsalary increments and more general wage and salary increases, is thatsalary increments are free to go ahead in those employments (notably thepublic services) where they take the form of specified steps up a scale,whereas those employers who determine the amount of increments on thebasis of individual merit at managerial discretion are prevented frompaying any increments until the middle of 1967.    The CBI and managementgenerally are pressing very strongly indeed for some relaxation of this rule, which would enable these mainly salaried and managerial staffs toreceive salary increases during the first half of 1967.    On the otherhand the TUC strongly oppose any concession, pointing out that largenumbers of manual workers will be unable to secure pay increasesduring the period of severe restraint.    The general view of the ministerial Prices and Incomes Committee is that v/e must resistmaking any concession on this point.    The CBI in particular have,however, warned the Government that, if the White Paper is publishedwithout some relaxation of the existing restraint on salaries, they willbe forced to inform their members that they find this totally unacceptable.4.       Subject to consideration of these outstanding points, I think thatthe outcome of these discussions is not unsatisfactory and I recommendthat the Y/hite Paper should be published as soon as possible - probably on Monday, 21st November.    We must, of course, recognise that thepractical influence of both the CBI and TUC over their respectivemembers is limited.    Nevertheless, it is clear that we shall makemuch better progress with their co-operation than without it and Ithink that there is now a good prospect that co-operation during theperiod ahead will be forthcoming.M.

1/Draft of P.M. 11/117DRAPT WHITE PAPER ON PRICES AND INCOMES STANDSTILLPERIOD OP SEVERE JjES^TRAINTI     Introduction.The need for a standstill on prices and incomes was explained by the Prime Minister on 20th July 1366 and theway in which it was proposed that the standstill should beapplied was set out in the White Paper, Cmnd. 3073.I     2.     The object was to avoid increases in prices cr in incomesso far as possible during the period from 20th July to the endof 1966 and to regard the first half of 1967 as a period of severe restraint by all who are concerned with determiningprices and incomes.     The Government undertook to consult the confederation of British Industry, the Trades Union congress and other interested parties on the form which the stringentcriteria for the first half of 1967 should take.     these consultations have no?/ been completed and have shown a wide measure of agreement about the national need for exceptionalrestraint although it cannot be said that the criteria as setout below have been wholly endorsed.i iI     3.     The national response to the call for a standstill hasbeen extremely encouraging.     Management and unions, with very few exceptions, have done their utmost to support the stand-still and the Public generally have shown their willingness tocomply with the requirements of the standstill, even though this has entailed sacrifices by many people.I     h.     Although the Government has been obliged to bring part iv of the Prices and Incomes Act into operation they hope thatsevere restraint will be observed on a voluntary basis, andthat the same general responsible attitude which has markedthe period since 20th July will continue.     The Governmentwill use their statutory powers only to ensure that the voluntary support of the majority is not undermined by the actions of a few.I     5.     The six months of severe restraint will call for a continuation of personal restraint and readiness to accept some sacrifice of immediate personal benefit in the interestsof the whole community.     The guiding principle must be thatof national economic   and social priorities.     The Governmentare determined to see that prices, employment incomes andother forms of money incomes, including professional fees and dividends, are subject to the conditions of severe restraint.     During the coming months, the Government will consult the interested parties about the best way of carryingforward the productivity, prices and incomes policy after 30thJune 1967.
II     PRICES AND CHARGES1o     The Government recognise that there has been some concernduring the standstill period about increases, particularly in retail prices and charges by the service industries and trades.It was recognised from the outset by the Government that itwould not be possible to rule out limited increases in someprices and charges as a result of changes in world prices, seasonalfluctuations in supply or increased taxation.     There has been considerable success in holding the general level of prices so far,but this in no way lessens the need for all concerned to striveto keep any increases to a minimum and to work continually for price reductions..2,     Throughout the period of severe restraint until the end ofJune 1967, just as in the standstill period to the end of 1966,,the criteria for increases in prices or charges must necessarily/be much more stringent than those set out in the White Paper on.Prices and Incomes Policy (Cmnd.2639, Part I, paragraph. 9)-During the period of severe restraint,, all enterprises both inthe private and the public sectors will be expected to make as great an effort as possible to absorb, increases in cost whatever the circumstances in v/hich these arise.     The Government believethat they cam. rely with confidence on the voluntary co-operationof the great majority of those who are in a position to determine&apos;the movement of prices and charges.     In appropriate casesproposals will be referred to the National Board for Prices and incomes.     Where those responsible for determining prices actin clear breach of the severe restraint criteria the Governmentin consultation with the C.B.I. and the T.U.C. will consideraction under Part IV to ensure that the national interest prevails,,3-     Reductions in prices wherever these can be achieved are very important both on their ov/n grounds and in order to offsetunavoidable increases elsewhere.     The criteria for price reductions which were set out in paragraph 10 of Part I of the.White Paper (Cmnd.2639) remain valid.     These laid emphasis on.the principle that reductions in costs per unit of output should normally be reflected in reduced prices,,     The removal of theimport surcharge at the end of November should offer scope for price reductions.h.      It is recognised, however, that some increases in pricesjmay prove unavoidable.     The circumstances in which such increasesmay be justifiable are set out in the following paragraphs..Criteria for Price Increases5.     As indicated in paragraphs k and 5 &amp;f Cmnd.3073? price increases may be justified where there has been a marked increasethat cannot be absorbed in the costs of imported materials or inicosts arising from changes in supply for seasonal or other reasons,,or which are due to action by the Government, such as increased,taxation;    or v/here an enterprise finds itself faced by increased costs which it is unable to restrain,, and which are too large to absorb fully, such as the cost of bought-in. components forming alarge part of its total costs.     There may also be exceptional circumstances in which without some increase in price the receipts of an enterprise are not adequate to enable it to maintainefficiency and undertake necessary investment.2.
6.      In examining proposed price increases,  it will &quot;be necessaryto take into consideration, where appropriate, the relationship&quot;between particular increases in costs that have been sustainedand the total costs of the enterprise concerned and the relationship between the efforts made to absorb increases in costs and the overall profitability of the enterprise.7.      In general, it is to be expected that restraint uponincomes, under the strict criteria set out below, will keepdown increases in labour costs.     This should increase theopportunity to absorb them and thereby to hold or reduce prices.Type of Price Covered8.      These criteria for price behaviour during the first halfof 1967 will apply to all prices and charges of goods and services, whether provided by public or private enterprise.It is essential that wholesalers and retailers should applychese same criteria to their prices just as much as manufacturers.9.     All concerned in the negotiation of prices under individualcontract during the period of severe restraint should equallyhave full regard to the above criteria.Arrangements for Notification10.    The effectiveness of the policy of severe restraint on prices, and public acceptance of the restraint which as wage and salary earners and pensioners they are expected to observerequire that the Government should have an adequate opportunityto consider in advance proposed increases in prices.      It wouldnot, however, be possible to require prior notification ofevery price change across the whole field of wholesale and retail trading involving a vast number of different items.11.    In many cases, detailed arrangements for advance notifica-tion of proposals &quot;by manufacturers to increase prices already exist by agreement between Government Departments and represen-tatives of various industries and trades under the early warningscheme described in Cmnd.2808.      It is intended that these arrangements should continue to be applied during the period of severe restraint together with similar arrangements made withother industries with which discussions are now in progress.12.    The Government intend that there should be sufficientflexibility in these arrangements to ensure that they adequatelyreflect the differing circumstances of different industries.It is envisaged that arrangements of this type agreed inaccordance with paragraph 8 of Cmnd.3073 or arising out ofarrangements made in accordance with paragraph 10(a) shouldprogressively replace the existing general request for advancenotification that was made in paragraph 9 of Cmnd.3073.Criteria after June 196713. Guidance for those concerned with the determination ofprices and charges after 30th June 1967 will be given afterconsultation with the C.B.I. and the T.U.C.3.
inRENTS AND RATESPrivate Housing RentsIII   1.     The level of rents charged by landlords for virtually thewhole of the private housing sector is already determined withinthe statutory framework of the Rent Acts.     The Government are continuing to keep the movement of rents of private housingunder close scrutiny.Local Authority Housing Rents III.   2.     Local authorities are by lav/ responsible for determining the rents they charge and are required by statute to balance thehousing accounts year by year.      Increased costs not met fromrents must generally be recouped from the rates, and authorities,are under a legal duty to hold the balance fairly between tenants and ratepayers.     By their responsible attitude during theperiod of standstill they have already given significant support to the Governments policy on prices and incomes.     Only 25 outof 1,600 authorities in Great Britain have found it necessary toincrease rents in this periods     During the period of severe restraint the Government will look to them to avoid or limit any increase as far as they can;    and where rent increases proveinevitable they will expect them to protect tenants of modestmeans by the application of rent rebates..Ill   3*     Local rates are a form of taxation, although they alsoenter into the cost of living, and are necessary to finance the whole range of services to the residents of the areaprovided by the local authority.     Local authorities have beemurged to ensure all proper economies in expenditure.Rents of Business Premises and of Land fIII   ho     Because of their effect on the prices of goods and services, it is important that increases in the rents ofbusiness premises and of land should be severely restrainedup to the end of June 1967? and Government Departments havegiven a lead by arranging to forgo, until the end of June 1967negotiated rights to higher rents for business premises, and for*&apos;  land, which become effective during the standstill or thefollowing period of severe restraint.     Private landlords areexpected to have full regard to the need for severe restraint,   .Rates
CONHDbN i SALix...jnc.omesThe main objectives on the incomes side during the periodof severe restraint are to ensure that any rise in money incomes in the first half of 1967 is kept to the minimum; to developarrangements for assessing claims for special treatment accordin,to the criteria for the period of severe restraint set out belowand to ensure a planned growth of money incomes in line withproductivity after it has ended;    and to promote social justice.The need is to secure that in future the parties concerned areinfluenced to a greater extent by a more objective assessment,against the wider background of the national interest, of the merits of a particular case before a final decision is reached.Employment&apos;Incomes2.     As stated in Cmnd. 3073 it would defeat the intention ifany attempt were made to make good in subsequent negotiationsincreases forgone as a result of the standstill and severe restraint.3.     As in the case of the standstill, severe restraint will apply to increases in pay and reductions in working hours(including increases in holidays) but not to other conditionsof service, except in so far as these are likely to add signifi-eantly to labour costs.     Paragraphs 17 and 18 of Cmnd.3073 willcontinue to apply for the purpose of determining &quot;increases in pay&quot; during the severe restraint period.    / ?   Reference tosalaries/h.     During the first six months of 1967 the considerations affecting incomes policy agreed between the Government,management and unions in April 1965 and set out in the white paper on Prices and Incomes Policy (Cmnd.2639) will continueto be in abeyance.      In particular,  the &quot;norm&quot; for the annual rate of increase in money incomes per head will be zero.Increases in incomes during this period will be justified onlyin exceptional cases where they can be shown to meet thefollowing criteria for exceptions, and even then only, on aseverely limited scale.     These criteria apply to private andpublic sectors alike.     They apply equally to arbitration and similar awards and to negotiated settlements.Productivi t year.     Agreements designed to increase productivity and efficiencyhave an important part to play in improving our national economic performance and will be given priority during the severe restraint period.      It will be necessary to ensure,however, that increases in pay or reductions in hours which areclaimed on grounds of contribution to productivity serve thenational interest as well as the interests of the workers andmanagements concerned.     As stated in Cmnd.2639? the employees concerned should make a direct contribution towards increasing productivity, for example, by accepting&apos;&apos;more exacting work ora major change in working practices and some of the benefit should accrue to the community as a whole in the form of lower prices or improvements in quality.     Payment of increases onthese grounds should be dependent upon the firm assessment ofthe improvement in production and not paid &quot;on account&quot;.5
Lowest paid workersIV     6.     Improvements of the standard of living of the worst-offmembers of the community is a primary social objective.   Asin practice the needs of individual workers are largelydetermined by the extent of their family commitments, theGovernment will continue to give a high priority to ^measuresspecifically designed to meet family needs.     However, it willbe necessary to ensure that any pay increases, justified onithese grounds are genuinely confined to the lowest paid workers and not passed on to the other workers..     It will be necessaryto take into account both earnings and hours worked.Distribution of ManpowerIV     7.     During the severe restraint period only in the most exceptional cases can. a pay increase be justified in order to attract or retain manpower.     Such cases will be subject to the closest scrutiny In the national interest.     Where there is ashortage of labour to undertake essential work, every effort must be made to meet the shortage by a more effective use ofthe manpower available.Comparability IV     8.     Similarly, pay increases will not in general be regardedas justified during the period of severe restraint on thegrounds of comparison with the level of remuneration for similar work or on the grounds of narrowing of differentials,There may be exceptional circumstances in which some immediateimprovement in pay is imperative to correct a gross anomaly.Such cases will have to be strictly examined to ensure thatsevere restraint is not undermined.      It will be necessaryto ensure that any such improvement is strictly confined andnot used as an excuse for &quot;catching up&quot; increases for other groups.IV     9.      Claims based on existing links with other groups must beconsidered individually on their merits against the criteria for incomes set out abovenExisting CommitmentsIV     10..    The operative dates of commitments to increase pay or.reduce hours by specified amounts entered into on or before20th July 1966, which were originally due to be implementedbefore the end of 1966, should be deferred for six months inaccordance with the White Paper (Cmnd.,3073) * operativedates of such commitments which were originally due to be implemented in the first six months of 1967? should be deferred until at least 1st July 1967, unless they are regarded by the Government as satisfying the criteria for the period of severe restraint set out above.     As stated in the White Paper(Cmnd.3073), it will also be open to the parties to existing commitments to renegotiate their agreements in order to conform with the severe restraint criteria.IV     11.   Where, however, a previous commitment for a pay increase,or reduction in hours (other than a minor improvement or anincrease under a cost-of-living sliding scale arrangement)affecting the same group of workers has already been deferredas a result of the standstill, a subsequent commitment can be implemented without deferment.
II A.    /Where commit merits existed on or &quot;before 20th July 1966 fora pay increase or an hour&apos;s reduction to he operative prior tothat date, hut the amount had not &quot;by then been determined,the operative date should be deferred by six months.      Where,however, commitments existed on or before 20th July for pay increases to be operative from a later date the amount of whichhad not by then been determined, the operative date \ should be deferred until at least 1st July 1967/, except insofar as earlierpayments can be shown to be justified against the severe restraint criteria^12,      The operative dates of pay increases under cost-of-livingsliding scale arrangements which were originally due before theend of 1966 should be deferred for six months in accordance withthe White Paper (Cmndo3073)o      The operative dates of such pay increases which were originally due in the first six -months of1967 should be deferred until at least 1st July 1967.The Public Services12A.   - Employers and employees in the public services will be under the same obligations to observe the criteria for theperiod of severe restraint as the rest of the community.12B.    ,/Where commitments existed on or before 20th July 1966    for a pay increase or an hour&apos;s reduction to take effect beforethe end of 1966, but the amount had not been determined by 20thJuly 1966, the operative date should be deferred for six months.Where such commitments were due to take effect in the first halfof 1967 the operative date should be deferred until at least1st July.      In either case, earlier payments should only bemade insofar as they can be shown to be  justified under the severe restraint criteria,//712C.    ^Discussions will be held with the representatives of the groups of staff concerned on the application of these general principles in cases where commitments for pay increases orhours reductions existed on or &quot;before 20th July 1966 but theamount had not &quot;been determined &quot;by then./&apos;12D.    No increase in the pay of the public services will be paidin the first half of 1967 unless it oan be shown to be  justifiedunder the criteria set out above.      Increases, payment of whichhas been deferred until at least 1st July 1967 will, ifsubstantial, be paid in instalments as necessary.Arrangements for guidance on claims and proposals to increase pay13.      Under the &quot;early warning&quot; arrangements which were described in the White Paper?    &quot;Prices and Incomes Policy:An &apos;Early Warning&apos;  System&quot; (Cmndo 2808), the C.B. Land the T0U.C.receive information about claims and proposals to increase payfrom their own members.      The Ministry of Labour receive similarinformation about claims and proposals to increase pay from the
T.U. Co  and C.B. I., from organisations which are not members of either of these bodies and directly from firms and employers&apos;organisations in the case of local and company negotiations.These arrangements wili continue and will be of even greater importance during the severe restraint period,IV   1h.    Information is required about claims and proposals toincrease pay or reduce hours (including pay and productivityproposals) relating to national, local and company negotiations.For practical reasons, however,  such information covering lessthan 200 employees need not be notified to the Ministry of Labourunless it is regarded as significant either because of the natureof the claim or because of the possible repercussions on the pay of other groups.    All the parties to claims and proposals toincrease pay, whether at national, local or company level, areexpected to conform to the severe restraint criteria, whether ornot the claim or proposal has been notified.IV   15.    On receipt of information under these arrangements theGovernment will consider whether the proposals are consistent with the criteria described above and will make any further enquiries that may be necessary.    The object will be to ensurethat any settlement reached (or pay increase awarded) is con-sistent with the national interest.    Appropriate cases will bereferred to the National Board for Prices and Incomes.    If theparties concerned reach a settlement in clear breach of the severe restraint criteria the Government, in consultation withthe T.U.C. and C.B.I., Will consider action under Part IV of thePrices and Incomes Act, 1966, to ensure that the national interestprevails.    It will be the aim of the Government, in consultationwith the C.B.I.  and the T.U.C., and with the help of the N.B.P.T.in individual cases, to secure the effective and consistent appli-cation of the severe restraint criteria to claims and proposals to increase pay.Criteria after June, 1967IV   16.    Guidance for those negotiating settlements to take effectafter 30th June, 1967 will be given after consultation with theC.B.L, T.U.C.  and other interested parties,  /in the meantime,however,  it should be generally understood that the countrycannot at present afford any further general reduction in thestandard working week or general movements towards longer holi-days.    The economic effects of shorter hours and longer holidayscan Toe as important as those of straight pay increases.    Thusimprovements in pay, hours and holidays and other conditions ofservice likely to add significantly to labour costs need to beconsidered together for the purposes of incomes policy.    Therecent tendency to seek imporvements in pay or hours (or both)at intervals of 12 months or even less has added considerably toour economic difficulties.    It should also be generally under-stood that if the cost of living is to be stabilised in future,there should not be increases based on automatic cost-of-livingsliding scales in addition to negotiated pay increases.    A moreco-ordinated approach to wage and salary questions among employersand trade unions will be needed to help determine the relativeeconomic and social priorities of competing claims on behalf ofdifferent groups and sections of the community^/Other Forms of IncomeIV   17.    The criteria for employment incomes during the period of severe restraint should be applied to all other forms of personal incomes.    Those who are responsible for determining or are capable of influencing the incomes of self-employed persons should therefore be guided by these criteria.    In some cases,8confbdentsal
however, it may he more appropriate to apply the criteria for price behaviour, e,g. in relation to charges or fees of self-employed persons. Appropriate cases involving non-employmentincomes will he referred to the National Board for Prices andInc ome s.VPensionsIV   18.    Proposals to increase existing pensions and similar benefits should take into account the same criteria to be applied to proposed increases in employment incomes.    The incomes of manyoccupational pensioners are still small, and some increases may therefore be justifiable and accepted as a priority by those stillin employment who are being asked to exercise restraint, as wellas by the better-off pensioners whose claims are less urgent.These criteria do not however apply to the introduction of newpension schemes or improvements to existing pension schemes which do not involve an increase in pensions already in payment,since these are different in character.    In considering any pension proposals, regard shoul be had to the cost of pensionprovision as an element in labour costs.Profits and DividendsIV   19.    The Government are pledged to use their fiscal powers orother means to deal with any excessive growth in aggregateprofits.    The Government have already made it clear that the standstill will continue to apply to all company distributionsin the first half of 1967 (paragraph 31 of the White Paper&quot;Prices and Incomes Standstill&quot;).    Up to 20th July, 1967? com-panies should not distribute more to shareholders in respect ofa financial year than in the preceding financial year, nor should they pay out more in the twelve months after 20th July, 1966 thanin the twelve months before that date.    If any company thinks that there might be imperative reasons for not observing thisstandstill, the Treasury should be consulted beforehand.V     NATIONAL BOARD FOR PRICES AND INCOMESV   20.    The National Board for Prices and Incomes has&quot; been reconsti-tuted on a statutory basis in accordance with Part I of thePrices and Incomes Act, 1966.    The Government, the confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress believe that1the process of Independent examination by the Board will be ofparticular importance during the period of severe restraint andthe Government will refer to the Board appropriate cases relatingto prices and incomes for examination in the light of the abovecriteria.    The Government will also continue to refer to theBoard matters of longcer term significance in the field of productivity, prices and incomes.9
