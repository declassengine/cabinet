CONFIDENTIAL &quot;        389DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)P QC(66) 183 COPY NO. , ,16th December, 1966CABINETFAMILY endowment memorandum by the Minister of Social SecurityPressure is growing for us to declare our intentions fordealing with cyril poverty.    As my colleagues know from my earlierpaper (C(66) 157), my strongly held view is that our solution to thepresent problem of family endowment should not be any type of means -tested scheme but should take the form of a &quot;give and take&quot; scheme -that is, a substantial increase hi family allowances together withsimultaneous reduction of the corresponding income tax child allowances.     The combined effect would be to leave most familiespaying tax at the standard rate with approximately the same net incomeas before, while those below the standard rate level would gain anythingup to the full amount of the family allowance increase.The objective2.     While clearly the poorest families are those &quot;deficient&quot; bysupplementary benefit standards, I must strongly emphasise that itwould be quite wrong to think that the problem of family endowmentconsists solely of finding a way to help these 160, 000 families.    Ofthe two types of means-tested scheme which have been proposed forconsideration, straight supplementation of wages up to the supplementary benefit level would do nothing whatever for the many families  in thearea just above that level, who are very far from well off.    A housing allowance would do something for them, but not nearly as much as agive and take scheme (which is, of course, why the latter iscorrespondingly more expensive).    I would regard help for thiswhole area of low income families as highly desirable on merit inany event, but the case for it is strengthened by the iassoseas anprospect in rents during 1967, in national insurance contributions nextOctober, and, when they take place, in the charges for school meals and welfare milk.Objections to a means-tested scheme3.     My reasons for opposing a means-tested scheme andadvocating a give and take scheme are, in brief -(a)    A new means-tested scheme for people in full-time work would represent a radical departure from bur avowedphilosophy on social security benefits, which has alwaysbeen one of minimal reliance on means tests.-1-
(b) A give and take scheme would provide, at moderate cost,a considerable degree of concentration of help on poorerfamilies J and this would be given automatically, throughthe presQii^ family allowances, without the need for a new and continuing means test of any kind.    Under a means -tested scheme, on the other hand- people would have tomake a special new claim.     Some of those eligible would fail to claim; and I believe that many men in fell-timework would strongly resent having to subject themselvesto a means test in order to have their earningssupplemented by a social security payment.(c) If we were to have a means-tested scheme and little or no improvement in family allowances, the pattern of Statesupport for families would be most unfair.     Those at the bottom of the income range  would get means-testedbenefit, while those at the top would continue to getsubstantial help from their income tax child allowances(as v/ell as family allowances),,    But over an areabeginning just above the means-tested level therewould be many families, very far from well off, whowould have only the inadequate family allowances a.ndlittle or no help from the tax child allowances.(d) Any means-tested scheme must involve a reduced financialincentive for its beneficiaries   to increase or even maintain their earnings.    There would be accusations of deliberateslacking, whether well founded or not, and there v/ould be considerable feeling between the responsible man, whoworked hard enough to be independent, and the man who,for example, refused overtime because he preferred to rely on means-tested benefit.    Already there is concernand criticism, among some of our most loyal supportersabout the &quot;malingerer&quot;.(e) Under either type of means-tested scheme, it would benecessary to base benefit on a man&apos;s &quot;normal&quot; earnings.In many cases this would be an extremely difficult and unsatisfactory concept to apply to people in full-time work.My own Ministryls experience in the administration ofspecial hardship allowance under the Industrial InjuriesAct indicates that this problem would cause widespreadargument and dissatisfaction, as well as many troublesomeenquiries of employers.4.     I can understand the difficulties of introducing a give and takescheme before April, 1968, but I am as yet unconvinced that they arcinsolubte.       If they are, it may be suggested that we should introduce a means-tested scheme in 1967 solely as an urgent interim measure,in the form of either a housing allowance or straight supplementation,and that further study could then be given to what might be done in the longer term,    I must make it quite clear to my colleagues that a means-tested scheme, of either form, could not be temporary.    Onceintroduced, it would be with us indefinitely.   This is simply because,as the figures show, no foreseeable subsequent increase of family-2-GONF9DENT1AL
allowances, even as part of a give and take scheme, would be anywherenear large enough to float off from the means-tested scheme ail the families who would meanwhile have come on to it.    Clearly, wecould not wind up a scheme, once introduced, if this meantdepriving even a small number of beneficiaries of the help theywere receiving from it.Timing for a means-tested scheme \5.      On the question of timing for a means-tested scheme, the continuing severe strain on my Ministry1^ local offices in the periodahead will be such that, if the general up-rating of benefits planned for next October is not to be imperilled, the only possible operative date before May, 1968 for either a housing allowance or a scheme ofstraight supplementation would be at the end of next July.    Thiswould require Royal Assent for the legislation by Easter.6.      It might be thought that the introduction of a scheme ofstraight supplementation should be simple and straightforward, bothin legislative and in administrative preparation, on the basis that itwould mean no more than an extension of the already availableprovisions and machinery of the present supplementary benefitsscheme to people in full-time work, by simply removing the present statutory ba-r to their qualifying under this . scheme.     This is howevernot so.     There would be a number of awkward problems to settle,including the method and frequency of assessing entitlement (inparticular the calculation of &quot;normal earnings&quot;, for which new anddistinctive rules would be needed), the extent to which the presentrules for &quot;disregards&quot; would apply (they could not be left unaltered)and whether benefit, once in payment, would be withdrawn during a trade dispute (which, even considered solely as a matter ofmechanics, would not be easy).    In terms of legislation, therefore,straight supplementation would probably require little less than a housing allowance.    On the practical side, new rules and newadministrative procedures would need to be worked out and to beready for application when the load of new claims began.     There is thefurther important point, on either type of means-tested scheme, thatthe tuc&apos;s reaction would have to be ascertained before any announce-ment could be made.     Judging by past form, they will need some time before being able to give it, and it is likely to be unfavourable.    i must therefore make it clear that at this point of time it cannot beassumed that either a housing allowance or a scheme of straightsupplementation could be brought into operation before May, 1968.conclusion.      My firm view is that we should not prejudice the future by introducing a means-tested scheme (which, as explained above, might in any case not be practicable before May, 1968) but should decide infavour of a give and take scheme to start as soon as possible.    5 stillbelieve this could be in 1967.    But if this were shown to be impracticable, I suggest that we should decide - and at theappropriate moment announce that we had done so - to introduce such a scheme from April, 1968, and make in the interim a limitedstraightforward increase of family allowances for the largestfamilies, since it is among these that poverty is liable to be mostsevere.     This increase would be subsumed in the general give and-3-
take operation in April, 1968, so that the only resulting extra cost would be in the period until then.    Within the   10 million limit whichthe Chancellor of the Exchequer has previously indicated for anyfamily endowment expenditure in 1967-68, we could, for example,manage an increase of 5 s. a week for the fourth and subsequent children in t.-    family, operative from a date in the early summer jif more money were available, a better increase could be given.Provided there was at the same time a firm public commitment to a major improvement in April, 1968, I think this would help to hold the position until then.M, H.Ministry of Social Security, W.
