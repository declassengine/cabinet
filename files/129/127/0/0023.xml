DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)0(66)164Uth November, 1966ECGD COVER FOR ARGENTINAMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI have to ask the Cabinet to resolve a difference of view whichhas arisen in the Sub-Committee on External Economic Policy of the ministerial Committee on Economic Development over the percentageof the risk on capital goods exports to Argentina which the export credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) should be allowed to insure.I am submitting this memorandum setting out the opposing views since,in the absence of the First Secretary of State, I acted as Chairman ofthe Sub-Committee when this issue was discussed.2.    ECGD cover is normally given on 90 per cent of the amount at risk on any contract.    In 1958, when Argentina was a sellerss market and there was considerable demand for cover, the Export GuaranteesAdvisory Council decided that cover for medium term transactionsshould be limited to 75 per cent of the amount at risk.    from october 1962 until March 1965 ECGD was off cover for capital goodsbusiness with Argentina under Section 2 of the Export Guarantee Act,. 1949.In March 1965 the Ministerial Sub1-Committee on External economic policy decided in the light of some improvement in the Argentine economythat a measure of Section 2 cover should be made available, subject to a limit of  6 million on debts maturing in any one year.    The percentageof cover, however, remained at 75 per cent of the amount at risk.    since march 1965 ECGD have insured virtually no Section 2 business with argentina.3.    At their meeting of 9th November the Sub-Committee consideredmemoranda by the Minister of Aviation and myself recommending thatthe percentage of cover on Section 2 business with Argentina should beincreased from 75 per cent to the normal 90 per cent.    A large majority of the Sub-Committee supported this recommendation.    Theirreasons can be summarised as follows -(a) Exporters were unwilling to accept as much as 25 per cent of therisk themselves, and had difficulty in raising finance on these terms.    The restricted percentage of cover thus effectivelyexcluded British exporters from the growing market for capital goods in Argentina, of which our competitors would be able totake advantage.    The restriction also frustrated theSub-Committee&apos;s decision of March 1965 to permit a limited measure of Section 2 business with Argentina.    Normal terms-1-COPY NO.CABINET
of cover were available for very large and expensive projects in Argentina which qualified for Financial Guarantees, and itwas illogical to refuse these terms on other capital goodscontracts.    Normal terms of cover were also available forSection 2 business with other Latin American countries, whoseeconomic prospects, in many cases, were no better than thoseof Argentina.(b) Although on several occasions in recent years we had had torefinance a proportion of outstanding Argentine liabilities,our exports to Argentina had in general been of substantialbenefit to our balance of payments.    Between 1955 and 1965ECGD covered business with Argentina worth  143 million, ofwhich only 10 per cent had to be refinanced.    With almost allcontracts the value of the down payment would exceed the valueof the import content of the goods, so that at no stage wouldthere be even a temporary loss to our balance of payments.(c) We had to consider not only the effect on the balance of payments,but also the balance of advantage to our economy as a whole.Capital goods made up an increasing proportion of our exportsto Argentina, as of our exports as a whole.    At a time when wecould expect a downturn in industrial activity in this country weneeded export markets wherever we could find them.    If we didnot sell our capital goods in Argentina, it would not by any meansfollow that we should be able to sell them in other, morecredit-worthy markets.(d) British manufacturers were currently interested in a number of substantial contracts in Argentina.    They would almost certainly be unable to proceed with negotiations unless thenormal percentage of cover were restored.    One of these contracts was for the supply of Handley Page Herald aircraftworth  8- 9 million to the Argentine armed services.Handley Page v/ould withdraw from the negotiations, which were very near completion, if they were required to carry 25 per cent of the risk themselves.    Argentina and other Latin american countries offered promising markets for British aircraft exports.It would be inconsistent with the Governments policy of support for the aircraft industry to require aircraft manufacturers tocarry excessive risks in their export business.4.      The Chief Secretary, Treasury with some support from the Ministerof Overseas Development argued that the present limits on credit cover for Argentina should stand, for the following main reasons -(a)    Argentina had a bad record of economic mismanagement undersuccessive Governments.    The economic policies of the presentArgentine Government were far from clear, and offered littlepromise of improvement.    In such circumstances it was essentialto maintain tight control over the total of outstanding debts.The restriction on the percentage of cover and the limit onannual maturities were both ways of exercising this control.There was no evidence to suggest that Argentina was now morecredit-worthy than before; but such evidence was needed before any improvement in the terms of credit could be justified.
(b) Further refinancing of Argentine debts remained a strongpossibility.    In such circumstances, the cost to our balanceof payments would be correspondingly greater if, by relaxing the controls on credit, v/e allowed insured debts due to Britishsuppliers to pile up.    It would be extremely difficult to accommodate further refinance for Argentina within the aidceiling, and this could only be done at the expense of other,more aid-worthy countries and projects.(c) The contract for the supply of Handley Page Heralds to theArgentine armed services was at present conditional on theprovision of six years&apos; credit for three of the aircraft.Ministers had decided earlier in the A/ear that five years shouldbe the maximum length of credit for this type of aircraft, andthere was no case for reversing the decision.5.      In the course of discussion the Chief Secretary proposed a compromise solution under which the percentage of cover would be raised from the present 75 per cent to 90 per cent, but at the same time thelimit on annual maturities would be reduced from  6 million to  3 million.This proposal did not commend itself to the Sub-Committee.6,      I therefore invite the Cabinet to decide whether -(a) ECGD should continue to cover only 75 per cent of the risk onSection 2 business with Argentina;  or(b) ECGD should, within the present limit of  6 million on annualmaturities, be empowered to cover 90 per cent of the risk,D.P.T.
