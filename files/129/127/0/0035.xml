68C(66) 176 COPY NO.___30th November, 1966CABINETLOCAL AUTHORITY CURRENT EXPENDITURE(ENGLAND AND WALES) 1967-68 AND 1968-69Memorandum by the Minister of Housing andLocal government at their meeting on 10th November (CC(66) 56th Conclusions,Minute 6) the Cabinet approved the proposals put forward by theChancellor of the Exchequer in C(66) 152 for further cuts in the levelof local expenditure to be accepted for the purpose of fixing the totalof the rate support grant, on the understanding that, if the reductionsmet with strenuous and well-founded objections, there would be anopportunity for Ministers to consider the matter further,2.     Since then the estimates have been discussed in detail between officials representing the Departments concerned and the localauthorities.    Finally, to complete the process of consultation, theSecretary of State for Education and Science, the Secretary of Statefor Wales, the Minister of Health and I, supported by Ministers -representing the Home Department and the Ministry of Transport,have today seen elected representatives to hear at first hand the viewsof the local authority associations and the Greater London Council,This memorandum records our agreed conclusions,3.      The local authorities fully accept that under present conditions we may not be able to afford to develop services at the rate previously envisaged and, given a lead by the Government, they are ready to play their part in reducing the rate of growth of public expenditure.    Butthey are emphatic that the Government must come out into the open and make a clear statement of policy on the need to slow the growth ofpublic expenditure in the light of the present economic situation.    they attach importance to this for two reasons.    First, because they considerthat the Government should accept responsibility and because experience has shown (in their view) that unless the Government publicly recognise the need to go slow local authorities will find themselves subject to allmanner of pressures to incur extra expenditure despite the paring oftheir estimates.    Their second reason is that a public statement ofpolicy is essential if results are to be achieved.    Local authorities arealready well advanced with the preparation of their estimates for nextyear and, if these are to be looked at in a new light, they need, to be toldso and quickly.    We are agreed that such a statement needs to be made,though its form will require consideration.DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT)
4.     The local authorities1 second main point is that even given anearly and explicit public statement it will not be possible to realise the cuts which are demanded - if insisted on they will remain to someextent paper cuts.    It is not merely that the arbitrary additional cuts of  30 million in 1967-68 and  45 million in 1968-69, though directedin the first instance at the environmental services, could only beachieved, in so far as they were achieved at all, by making furthercuts on other services, in addition to the reasoned cuts alreadyproposed.    There is a more general reason why in the localauthorities&apos; view the cuts are quite unrealistic and that is that theyignore the current level of expenditure.    hi pressing for reductions in the estimates for 1967-68 and 1968-69 Departments have basedthemselves largely on the level of actual expenditure in 1965-66 andthe rates of growth of expenditure for which their figures allowpostulate a level of expenditure in the current year well below thelocal authority estimates.    In effect, so the local authorities say,Departments have been arguing from a false base;   the estimates for1966-67 are the best available evidence as to the current level ofexpenditure and with the year two-thirds spent it is too late to change the pattern.    The proposed expenditure figures for next year thus leavemuch less room for growth than they have been presented as doing andare the less capable of realisation.    There is a lot of force in this,5.     The suggestion has in fact been made that in seeking to reducethe estimates of expenditure, the Governmenfs only real concern is toreduce the total of Exchequer assistance to local government (underthe proposals put to the local authority associations last February thetotal of grant for 1967-68 would be calculated as 54 per cent of the accepted estimated expenditure and for 1968-69 as 55 per cent); inother words, that after taking credit in the White Paper for reducingthe burden on the ratepayer the Government were now tryingsurreptitiously to increase it by basing the grant on unrealisticallylow estimates of expenditure.    This is a most damaging chargepolitically and one that the Opposition would be quick to take up.6,     As regards the estimates of relevant expenditure we are convinced that the cuts we are seeking are unrealistic, by which Imean that they will not be achieved and could not be in the time available without a disruption of services such as none of uscontemplates.    Even the reasoned cuts *. without the extra 30 million and  45 million - are very much more severe than anycuts ever made in the estimates of expenditure for the purposes ofthe general grant,    li we insist on the full cuts, there will not be acorresponding reduction in public expenditure; it is impossible to say how much of the proposed savings would be achieved but I ami in nodoubt - and all the associations emphasise this - that there would bean usually sharp increase in the rates next spring,    (This yearlsfreeze in local authority rents will in any case mean higher ratesnext year, )70     My colleagues and I recognise the Chancellor^ difficulties and we are prepared, as we have always been prepared, to concedethat local authorities should be placed under financial pressure tokeep their expenditure down.    But they should be given an expendituretarget which, even if they cannot hit it, is not so far out of reach as tobe a mockery.    On this basis I would propose that we remit two-thirds-2-

of the arbitrary cuts for which we have been contending - in other words add  20 million and  30 million respectively to the figures which we have so far said we are prepared to accept.     I have placed the salient figures in the Annex.    I have given first the expenditure figures in terms of mid-1966 prices, since our previous considera-tion   was on this basis; but it is the mid-November figures on whichthe total of grants would be based.8.     I invite my colleagues to agree -(a) that there should be an early public statement on theneed to slow the growth of public expenditure withparticular reference to local authorities;(b) that for the purpose of calculating the total of exchequer grants the estimates of expenditure should be increased by  20 million in 1967-68and  30 million in 1968-69.A.
