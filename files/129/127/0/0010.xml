COPY NO.      6 VCABINETPRICES AND INCOMES STANDSTILL:  DRAFT WHITE paper on PERIOD OF SEVERE RESTRAINTNote by the First Secretary of State and secretary of State for Economic Affairs   ,I circulate herewith a draft White Paper on Criteria for prices and Incomes in the Period of Severe Restraint.    It reflects the views expressed at a meeting of the Ministerial Committee on prices and Incomes on 4th November.    I will report orally to theCabinet on the consultations on the draft which I am having withthe Confederation of British Industry and Trades Union congress on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week.2.       It will probably be necessary to add a paragraph to thedraft dealing with pay in the public services in the light of a further meeting of the Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomesarranged for Wednesday, 9th November.3.      I recommend that consultations with other interested parties should be carried out without delay and the White Paper publishedearly next week.M. S.IIDepartment of Economic Affairs, S.

DRAFT WHITE PAPER ON PRICES AND INCOMES STANDSTILL -PERIOD OF SEVERE RESTRAINTI   introduction the need for a standstill on prices and incomes was explained by the Prime Minister on 20th July 1966 and thevray in which it was proposed that the standstill should beapplied was set out in the White Paper, Cmnd.3073&quot;I   2.     The object was to avoid increases in prices or in incomesso far as possible during the period from 20th July to the endof 1966 and to regard the first half of 1967 as a period of severe restraint by all who are concerned with determiningprices and incomes.     The Government undertook to consult the confederation of British Industry, the Trades Union congress and other interested parties on the form which the stringentcriteria for the first half of 1967 should take.     these consultations have now been completed.     ^Although the criteriaset out below have not been endorsed specifically by theseparties, they reflect a wide measure of agreement about thenational need for exceptional restraint^I   3.     The national response to the call for a standstill hasbeen extremely encouraging.      Management and unions, with very few exceptions, have done their utmost to support the stand still and the public generally have shown their willingness to complywith the requirements of the. standstill, even though this hasentailed sacrifices by many people.I   h.     Although the Government has been obliged to bring Part iv of the Prices and Incomes Act into operation they hope thatsevere restraint will be observed on a voluntary basis, andthat the same general responsible attitude which has marked theperiod since 20th July will continue.     The Government will use their statutory powers only to ensure that the voluntary supportof the majority is not undermined by the actions of a few.I   5.     The coming period of severe restraint is of great importancein itself because of the opportunity it offers the nation toimprove its competitive position in world trade and to fostergeneral stability of prices.I   6.     The six months of severe restraint will call for a continua-tion of personal restraint and readiness to accept some sacrifice of immediate personal benefit in the interests of the whole community.     The Government are determined to see that theprinciples of severe restraint govern prices, employment incomes and other forms of money incomes, including professional fees and dividends.     All our economic and social objectives and policies for sustained growth depend on our ability to competevigorously in export trade and with imports from other industrial countries.     This period is bound to be important also as a meansof developing an effective and just policy for productivity,prices and incomes for the longer-term.       During the coming months, the Government will consult the interested parties aboutthe best way of carrying forward the productivity, prices and incomes policy after 30th June 1967.- 1 -
II      PRICES AND CHARGESII   1.      The Government recognise that there has been some concernduring the standstill period about increases, particularly in retail prices and charges by the service industries and trades.It was recognised from the outset by the Government that it wouldnot be possible to rule out limited increases in some prices and charges as a result of changes in world prices, seasonal fluctua-tions in supply or increased taxation.     There has been consider-able success in holding the general level of prices so far, butthis in no way lessens the need for all concerned to strive tokeep any increases to a minimum and to work continually for price reductions.II   2.     Throughout the period of severe restraint until the end ofJune 1967?  just as in the standstill period to the end of 1966,the criteria for increases in prices or charges must necessarily be much more stringent than those set out in the White Paper on prices and Incomes Policy (Cmnd.2639s Part I, paragraph 9).During the period of severe restraint, all enterprises both inthe private and the public sectors will be expected to make as great an effort as possible to absorb increases in cost whatever the circumstances in which these arise.     The Government believethat they can rely with confidence on the voluntary co-operationof the great majority of those who are in a position to determine the movement of prices and charges.II   3*     Reductions in prices wherever these can be achieved are very important both on their own grounds and in order to offsetunavoidable increases elsewhere.     The criteria for price reductions which were set out in paragraph 10 of Part I of theWhite Paper (Cmnd.2639) remain valid.     These laid emphasis onthe principle that reductions in costs per unit of output should normally be reflected in reduced prices.II   k&apos;     It is recognised, however, that some increases in prices may prove unavoidable.     The circumstances in which such increases/ may be justifiable are set out in the following paragraphs.Criteria for Price IncreasesII   5.     As indicated in paragraphs k and 5 of Cmnd.3073, price increases may be justified where there has been a marked &quot;&quot;increasethat cannot be absorbed in the costs of imported materials or in costs arising from changes in supply for seasonal or other reasons,or which are due to action by the Government, such as increased taxation;    or where an enterprise finds itself faced by increased&quot;costs which it is unable to restrain, and which are too large to absorb fully, such as the cost of bought-in components forming alarge part of its total costs.       There may also be exceptional circumstances in which without some increase in price the receipts of an enterprise are not adequate to enable it to maintainefficiency and undertake desirable investment.II   6.     In examining proposed price increases,  the Government willtake into consideration, where appropriate, the relationship between particular increases in costs that have been sustainedand the total costs of the enterprise concerned and the relation-ship between the efforts made to absorb increases in costs andthe overall profitability of the enterprise.II   7.     In general, it is to be expected that restraint upon incomes,under the strict criteria set out below, will enable increases in labour costs to be absorbed and prices thereby held or reduced.- 2 -
II   Tyjpe^^ofJ^i^ce^ C^yjred8.    These criteria for price &quot;behaviour during the first half of1967 will apply to all prices and charges of goods and servicesswhether provided by public or private enterprise.     It isessential that wholesalers and retailers should apply these samecriteria to their prices just as much as manufacturers.II   9.     All concerned in the negotiation of prices under individualcontract during the period of severe restraint should equallyhave full regard to the above criteria.II   Arrangements for Notification 10.    The effectiveness of the policy of severe restraint on prices, and public acceptance of the restraint which as wage and salary earners and pensioners they are expected to observe, require that the Government should have an adequate opportunity to consider in advance proposed increases in prices.      It would not, however,be possible to require prior notification of every price changeacross the whole field of wholesale and retail trading involving a vast number of different items.II   11.    In many cases, detailed arrangements for advance notification of proposals by manufacturers to increase prices already exist byagreement between Government Departments and representatives ofvarious industries and trades under the early warning schemedescribed in Cmnd.2808.     It is intended that these arrangements should continue to be applied during the period of severe restrainttogether with similar arrangements made with other industries withwhich discussions are now in progress.II   12.    The Government intend that there should be sufficientflexibility in these arrangements to ensure that they adequatelyreflect the differing circumstances of different industries.It is envisaged that arrangements of-this type agreed in accordancewith paragraph 8 of Cmnd.3073 or arising out of arrangements madein accordance with paragraph 10(a) should progressively replace the general request for advance notification that was made in para-graph 9 of Cmnd.3073.II   13.   Pending the completion of such arrangements, the Governmentwill continue to expect major manufacturing enterprises (for convenience regarded as those employing 100 or more workers) togive the appropriate Department not less than twenty-eight days&apos;notice of any proposed increase in price.      If the Department. has not notified the enterprise concerned to the contrary beforethe end of the twenty-eight days, the enterprise will be entitledto assume that the Government have decided to take no further action in its proposals.3 -
inRENTS AND RATES PAY-gjQ-JHgusing RentsIII   1.     The level of rents charged by landlords for virtually thewhole of the private housing sector is already determined withinthe statutory framework of the Rent Acts,      The Government are continuing to keep the movement of rents of private housingunder close scrutiny.Local Authority Housing RentsIII   2.     Local authorities are by law responsible for determining the rents they charge and are required by statute to balance thehousing accounts year by year.     Increased costs not met fromrents must generally be recouped from the rates, and authoritiesare under a legal duty to hold the balance fairly between tenants and ratepayers.     By their responsible attitude during the periodof standstill they have already given significant support to theGovernment&apos;s policy on prices and incomes.     Only 25 out of 1,600authorities in Great Britain have found it necessary to,increaserents in this period.     During the period of severe restraintthe Government will look to them to avoid or limit any increase as far as they can;    and where rent increases prove inevitablethey will expect them to protect tenants of modest means by theapplication of rent rebates.Ill   3.     Local rates are a form of taxation, although they also enterinto the cost of living, and are necessary to finance the whole range of services to the residents of the area provided by thelocal authority.      Local authorities have been urged to ensureall proper economies in expenditure.Rents of Business Premises^ndof^LandIII   I+,     Because of their effect on the prices of goods and services,it is important that increases in the rents of business premises and of land should be severely restrained up to the end of June1967? and landlords are expected to have full regard to the needfor this.     Government Departments have given a lead by arrangingto forgo, until the end of June 1967? rights to higher rentsfor business premises and for land negotiated and becoming effec-tive during the standstill or following period of severe restraintRates- k -
IV      INCOMESThe main objectives on the incomes side during the period of severe restraint are to ensure that any rise in money incomes inthe first half of 1967 is kept to the minimum;    and to developarrangements for assessing claims for special treatment accordingto the criteria for the period of severe restraint set out belowand to ensure a planned growth of money incomes in line withproductivity after it has ended.     The need is to secure that infuture the parties concerned are influenced to a greater extent by a more objective assessment, against the wider background ofthe national interest, of the merits of a particular case before a final decision is reached.Employment incomes2.     As in the case of the standstill, severe restraint will applyto increases in pay and reductions in working hours (includingincreases in holidays) but not to other conditions of service,except in so far as those are likely to add significantly to labour costs.     Paragraphs 17 and 18 of Cmnd.3073 will continue to apply for the purpose of determining &quot;increases in pay&quot; during the severe restraint period.3.     During the first six months of 1967 the considerations affecting incomes policy agreed between the Government, management and unions in April 1965 and set out in the White Paper on prices and Incomes Policy (Cmnd.2639) will continue to be in abeyance.In particular, the &quot;norm&quot; for the annual rate of increase in money incomes per head will be zero.     Increases in incomes during thisperiod will be justified only in exceptional cases where they canbe shown to meet the following criteria for exceptions, and even then only on a severely limited scale.      These criteria apply to arbitration and similar awards as well as to negotiated settle-ments.Productivityk.     Agreements designed to increase productivity and efficiencyhave an important part to play in improving our national economicperformance and will be given priority during the severe restraintperiod.      It will be necessary to ensure, however, that increases in pay or reductions in hours which are claimed on grounds of contribution to productivity serve the national interest as wellas the interests of the workers and managements concerned.     Thismeans first that the employees concerned should make a directcontribution towards increasing productivity, for example, by accepting more exacting work or a major change in working practicessecondly, that payment of increases on these grounds should, so faras possible, be directly linked to improvements in productivityachieved and not paid &quot;on account&quot; before any firm assessment canbe made of the benefits;    and, thirdly, that some of the benefit should accrue to the community as a whole in the form of lower prices or improvements in quality.     For this purpose it will benecessary to ensure that the productivity increases in questionnaire properly assessed.L-Qgest paid workers.     Improvement of the standard of living of the worst-off membersof the community is a primary social objective.     As in practice the needs of individual workers are largely determined by theextent of their family commitments, the Government will continue- 5 -
to give a high priority to measures specifically designed tomeet family needs.     However, it will he necessary to securethat any pay increases during this period for lowest-paid workersin the community are genuinely confined to those whose totalearnings (taking into account any excessively long hours worked)are too low to maintain a reasonable standard of life.      Thismeans that their claims for special treatment by way of pay increases will have to be recognised and accepted by other workers,since some compression of differentials in earnings is bound tofollow.JJ is tj? distribution of. Manpower6.     During the severe restraint period only in the most exceptional cases can a pay increase be justified in order to attract or retain manpower.     Such cases will be subject to the closest scrutiny in the national interest.     Where there is ashortage of labour to undertake essential work, every effort mustbe made to meet the shortage by a more effective use of the man-power available.Comparability7.      Similarly, pay increases will not in general be regarded, asjustified during the period of severe restraint on the grounds of comparison with the level of remuneration for similar work oron the grounds of narrowing of differentials.     There may beexceptional circumstances in which some immediate improvement in pay is imperative to correct a gross anomaly.      Such cases willhave to be strictly examined to ensure that severe restraint isnot undermined.      It will be necessary to ensure that any suchimprovement is strictly confined and not used as an excuse for&quot;catching up&quot; increases for other groups.8.     Claims based on existing links with other groups must beconsidered individually on their merits against the criteria for incomes set out above.Existing Commitments9.     Existing commitments to increase pay or reduce hours enteredinto on or before 20th July, 1966, which are due to be implemented in the first six months of 1967, should be deferred until 1st July,1967 or later unless(i)    a previous commitment for a pay increase or reductionin hours (other than a cost-of-living increase) affectingthe same group of workers has already been deferredsince 20th July, 1966^    or(ii)    it is regarded by the Government as satisfying the criteria for the period of severe restraint set out above.As stated in the White Paper (Cmnd.3073) it will also be opento the parties to existing commitments to renegotiate theiragreements in order to conform with the severe restraint criteria.10.     The operative dates of pay increases which are due under cost-of -living sliding scale arrangements in the first six months of1967 should be deferred until 1st July, 1967 or later.- 6 -CONFBOEMT3AL
Arrangements for vetting claims and proposals to increase pa;11.    Under the &quot;early warning&quot; arrangements which were described in the White Paper:  &quot;Prices and Incomes Policy:    An &apos;early warning&apos; System&quot; (Cmnd.2808), the Ministry of Labour receiveinformation about claims and proposals to increase pay from theT.U.C. and C.B.I., from organisations which are not members of either of these bodies and directly from firms and employers&apos;-organisations in the case of local and company negotiations.These arrangements will continue and will be of even greater importance during the severe restraint period;    if necessary,they will be extended and strengthened.12.    Information is required about claims and proposals toincrease pay or reduce hours (including pay and productivityproposals) relating to national, local and company negotiations.For practical reasons, however, such information covering lessthan 200 employees need not be notified unless it is regardedas significant either because of the nature of the claim or because of the possible repercussions on the pay of other groups.All the parties to claims and proposals to increase pay, whether at national, local or company level, are expected to conform tothe severe restraint criteria, whether or not the claim orproposal has been notified.13.    On receipt of information under these arrangements theGovernment will consider whether the proposals are consistent with the criteria described in paragraphs 2-6 above and willmake any further enquiries that may be necessary.     The objectwill be to ensure that any settlement reached (or pay increaseawarded) is consistent with the national interest.     appropriate cases will be referred to the National Board for Prices and incomes.     Where,despite the views of the Government or therecommendations of the National Board, the parties concernedreach a settlement in clear breach of the severe restraintcriteria the Government, in consultation with the T.U.C. andC.B.I., will consider action under Part IV of the Prices and incomes Act, 1966, to ensure that the national interest prevails.It will be the aim of the Government, in consultation with theC.B.I, and the T.U.C., and with the help of the N.B.P.I. in individual cases, to secure the effective and consistent applica-tion of the severe restraint criteria to claims and proposals to increase pay.Criteria after June, 1967   :lh.   As stated in Cmnd.3073, it would defeat the intention ifany attempt were made to make good in subsequent negotiationsincreases forgone as a result of the standstill and severe restraint.     Guidance for those negotiating settlements totake effect after 30th June, 1967 will be given after consul-tation with the C.B.I.,.T.U.C. and other interested parties.This will cover the appropriate norm for increases in money incomes and any modifications in the criteria originally set outin Cmnd.2639 that experience shows to &quot;be necessary.     In themeantime, however, it should be generally understood that thecountry cannot at present afford any further general reductionin the standard working week or general movements towards longerholidays.      The economic effects of shorter hours and longerholidays can be as important as those of straight pay increases.Thus improvements in pay, hours and holidays and other conditionsof service likely to add significantly to labour costs need tobe considered together for the purposes of incomes policy.&quot;    The- 7 -
recent tendency to seek improvements in pay or hours (or &quot;both)at intervals of 12 months&apos;or even less has added considerably to our economic difficulties.      It should also be generallyunderstood that if the cost of living is to be stabilised infuture, there should not be increases based on automaticcost-of-living sliding scales in addition to negotiated pay increases.If    15.    Further consideration will also be given to the machinery and institutional arrangements which are needed to ensure thatthe criteria laid down are strictly observed.     A more co-ordinated approach to wage and salary questions among employersand trade unions will be needed to help determine the relativeeconomic and social priorities of competing claims on behalf ofdifferent groups and sections of the community.     ,/Both the C.B.I.and T.U.C. have undertaken to use their influence on the amount and timing of claims and offers after the end of the period of severe restraint with the object of avoiding inflationarysettlements^-Qj hgr.... Fo.g.ms. jgf^I nc o meIV    16.    In principle the criteria for employment incomes during theperiod of severe restraint should be applied to all other formsof personal income.      In some cases, however, it may be more,appropriate to apply the criteria for price behaviour, e.g. inrelation to charges or fees of self-employed persons.PensionsIV    17.    Pensions form an important part of total incomes arisingout of employment.      They should therefore be governed by theprinciple of severe restraint between 1st January and 30th June,1967 and in considering pension proposals, regard should be hadto the cost of pension provision as an element in labour costs..IV    18.    Proposals to increase existing pensions and similar benefits should take into account the same criteria to be applied to proposed increases in employment incomes.     The incomes of many-occupational pensioners are still small and some increases maywell be justifiable within the requirements of the criterion setout in paragraph IV.k above.      It is right that such increases should be accepted as a priority by those still in employmentwho are being asked to exercise restraint as well as by the better-off pensioners whose claims are less urgent.      In other cases, including commitments entered into on or before 20th July,1966 to improve existing or similar benefits which were originally intended to come into effect during the first half of 1967, the increases should be deferred until after 30th June.IV    19.   New pension schemes, or improvements to existing pension schemes, which do not involve an increase in pensions already in payment, are different in character and may be introduced duringthe period of severe restraint.Dividendsp    20.    The Government have already made it clear that the -jtand-still will continue to apply to all company distributions in thefirst half of 1967 (paragraph 32 of the White Paper &quot;Prices and incomes Standstill&quot;).     Up to 20th July, 1967, companies shouldnot distribute more to shareholders in respect of a financialyear than in the preceding financial year, nor should they payout more in the twelve months after 20th July, 1966 than in the twelve months before that date.      If any company thinks thatthere might be imperative reasons for not observing this stand-still, the Treasury should be consulted beforehand.21.   The Government are pledged to use their fiscal powers orother means to deal with any excessive growth in aggregate profitsor dividends.
