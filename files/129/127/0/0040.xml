SECRET *        352CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 181 COPY NO. 0 S16th December; 1966CABINETFAMILY endowment memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister without PortfolioOn 17th November the Cabinet invited us to give urgent considera-tion to an acceptable family endowment scheme (CC(66) 58th Conclusions,Minute 4(10)).     This paper sets out the main factors as we see them andour conclusions at this stage.2.       In considering our approach to these issues it is important tobear in mind that the full survey by the Ministry of Social Security isnot yet available:  it is not expected to be completed until next year orto be published until the end of May, 1967,    It is at the stage that publication takes place that public pressure is likely to build up most strongly.     Clearly we will need to have a considered view on how weapproach these questions before then.    The fact remains that althoughan interim report on the survey has already been studied by officials,our Ministerial colleagues have not had the opportunity of detailed discussion of the issues involved on the basis of a full report.3,       It may nevertheless be said that there appear to be two distinctbut overlapping problems here:  the problem of giving help to the poorest families and the question whether family allowances shouldbe increased and income tax child allowances reduced to achieve aredistribution of income,4,       The E.eport by the Social Services Committee (C(66) 159)indicated that having looked at a number of income tested and giveand take schemes (a scheme for increasing family allowances withsimultaneous reductions in child tax allowances), a majority of theCommittee favoured the latter.     This  approach, while having someimpact on the child poverty problem, could only provide a partialsolution to it.    It is perhaps fair to say (i) that the majority of theCommittee regarded any scheme of supplementary benefits for able-bodied men in work as politically and socially unacceptable except asa last resort even though other schemes would be less effective in bringing relief to the poorest families and (ii) that they viewed thewhole problem in somewhat broader terms than the needs of the poorest families alone.     The Cabinet will need to consider whetherit agrees with this approach.
5.      Against this? background, we agree that it is necessary for theGovernment to be prepared to have formed a view before the fullMinistry of Social Security survey is published but at present thereis doubt as to which of the schemes so far considered is the right wayto proceed.    There are considerable practical objections., and difficulties of principle about both any income-tested scheme or any form of give and take scheme    These are brought out in the further report by officials (C(66) 182).6.       The preliminary results of the survey undertaken by the Ministryof Social Security showed that there are about 160^ 000 families with500,000 children with incomes below supplementary benefits (formerlyNational Assistance) levels who were either unable to get such benefitsat all because the father is in full time work or only in part because ofthe &quot;wage stop&quot;.    A -;give and tak?&quot; scheme is clearly not designed todeal fully with the needs of these families and these children any morethan a housing allowance scheme or scheme of supplementary benefitsis designed to improve the relative position of families with incomesabove supplementary benefits levels.7.       Nor is it clear either that a housing allowance scheme is necessarily the best way to help the families in greatest need, or that a&quot;give and take&quot; scheme is the way to achieve changes if desired inrelativities over a wide range of incomes.    In the former case muchdepends on thelpreeise circumstances of the families concerned; forinstance, a family where the father is mentally or physically unable ever to earn more is a very different problem from one where the breadwinner is a young married worker with reasonable future prospects.In the latter case much, depends on precise objectives and wider economicand financial considerations,,consutteticm aim public Discussion8.      as we have already emphasised the full Ministry of Social SecuritySurvey is not yet available to Ministers and will not be ready for publication before the end of Mays 1967.    There is at present no satisfactory basis for informed public discussion or for outsideconsultation.9.      Whatever action is taken in the field of family endowment is likelyto be controversial,,    j&apos;f there were a consensus of informed publicopinion about the nature of the problems to be tackled and the ways inwhich they should be dealt with this would be of great value and help to10,       We both feel strongly that before any firm decisions are taken onissues cf this importance and complexity there should be full discussionwith the TUG in particular, the GBI (who have already shown signs ofalarm following recent press reports) and perhaps other representative bodies and persons.-2
11.       Quite apart from the time needed for ,contrultation arulJEur&amp;e-rdetailed study there are limitations on what we could do in 1967-68.At this date it would not really be practicable to give effect in 1967-68to a &quot;give and take&quot; scheme of any shape or form except as an emergencymeasure decided on immediately.    We both agreed that this would place an almost intolerable burden on the Departments concerned and wouldresult in a great deal of individual inequity.   A straight increase in family allowance would be technically possible but would be prohibitivelycostly, wasteful and unpopular.    (LAn &quot;increase of 5g. for third and subsequent children would cost  32! hiillionJn a full year and would be ineffective in dealing with any of the problems).12,      It would just about be possible to introduce with effect from august, 1967 an income-tested scheme such as a housing allowance scheme or a scheme for treating those in full employment and wage-stopcases so far as possible as if they were eligible for supplementary benefits,13.      We are not recommending any of these courses.Our Conclusions14,      These ares-(1)    We are not in a fully satisfactory position at the moment to--takefirm long term decisions about the problem of family endowment.    Further analysis of the nature of these problems and of possible answers to them is needed, as well as morepublic discussion and consultation with representative bodies.For this purpose we think that it may be desirable to publishan effective summary of the Ministry of Social Security Surveybefore it can be published in full in May, 1967.(2)    Provided we show that we are actively in search of an acceptablelong term solution, it should be possible to avoid having toadopt a temporary or interim scheme of family support.(3)    K the Cabinet has any doubt about f2), however, we must emphasise that the scope for action during 1967-68 is already severelylimited both on timetable and. expenditure grounds,    A decisions would have to be reached immediately and without the consultations which, as we have explained above, we thinkshould be undertaken! we do aot recommend this.15.      On 17th November the Cabinet-aleo agro-ed. that the price of school meals and welfare milk could be raised if an acceptable family endowmentscheme were introduced.   In fact all families with incomes at or belowsupplementary benefit levels can now get school meals and welfare milkfree.    It might be possible to devise a scheme for lifting the incomelimits for this concession.    We therefore think that:-(4)    A report should be prepared quickly on the possibility of extending existing concessions as awl &quot;when school meals and welfare -milk charges, were raised.Li. J.
