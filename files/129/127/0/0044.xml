DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 185 COPY NO.      6820th December, 1966nCABINETP. 1127Note by the Prime MinisterWe have to take a decision by the end of the year on whether or not we should continue with the Ps 1127.    In discussion in the Defense and Oversea Policy Committee there v/as a divisionof view and, although preponderant opinion was in favour ofcontinuation, the decision is one which the Cabinet will wish to take.I attach a note by officials setting out the considerations on either side.H. W.10, Downing Street, S. W. 1.20th December, 1966SECEIET
The Defence Review made provision for the purchase of 110P1127 aircraft (93 solos and 17 duals).    In considering the review in February (CC(66) 9th Conclusions) the Cabinet agreed that the PU27was important for United Kingdom industrial reasons and that at that stage we should plan on the assumption that it would be developed.The Cabinet, however, reserved the right to take a different decision should technical developments or the escalation of costs make itdesirable to do so.    Following their discussion, the Defence and oversea Policy Committee agreed in March (OPD(66) 15th Meeting,Item 1) that an order should be placed for 60 aircraft, with an optionfor a further 40, and that the issue should be further considered in theautumn in the light of feasibility studies, the cost of production and theprospect of export orders.The present position is that the programme is going well, thefirst two aircraft are flying and development should be completed withinthe estimate of last March,    Our commitments to the end of Decemberin respect of both research and development and production will totalabout  45 million, which is over one-third of the estimated cost of thedevelopment and production of the first 60 aircraft ( 120 million to 125 million) and 13 per cent of the total ten year programme cost of 336 million.    In addition, we have spent, including contributions fromthe United States and German Governments to the Kestrel programme and payments on the cancelled P1154, a further  70 million on thetechnology of vectored thrust,-1-P1127Note by OfficialsIntroductionThe P1127 is an aircraft intended to provide close support forour ground forces.    It is a major advance in this field through the exploitation of its unique ability to operate from very short roughstrips in the forward area (short take off and landing capability orSTOL) and to operate from small landing sites in the vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) mode with a bomb or rocket load.    At thetime of the Defence Review it was hoped that the VTOL. performance,which is limited in range and load, could be appreciably improvedthrough incorporating plenum chamber burning, but further studieshave established that this is not the answer and the most likelyalternative would be costly in both development and production.There are, however, indications that engine thrust increases canbe achieved in the normal course of development which will lead toworth while improvements in aircraft performance.There is no aircraft which can replace the special V/STOL.characteristics of the P1127, but it is possible - admittedly with somedetriment to the operational efficiency of our forces - to provide close support for the Army by means of different combinations of the Spey-Phantom and of the Anglo-French Jaguar.     The latter course would becheaper, but would involve additional expenditure in foreign currency and would have industrial implications for the future of the UnitedKingdom aircraft industry.     The question is the degree of priority to be accorded to the gain in operational efficiency.Defence Requirements
The further defence studies might call also for a review of thenumber of P1127 (or alternative aircraft) which will be required.    these studies will not be completed until July, 1967 and, theoretically, thedecision on the future of the P1127 should be taken then in the light ofthe cost and implications of the alternative courses.    By then, however,a further  26 million will have been committed on the P1127 and effectively deferment now would be equivalent to a decision to continue with the aircraft.    The choice on whether to continue or cancel theP1127 is therefore open to us only until the end of the year.The argument for cancellationThe argument for cancelling the P1127 is its cost and its lowdefence priority.    Pressure on the Defence Budget has increased.There is still the problem of attaining the Defence Review target of 2, 000 million at 1964 prices in 1969-70;  and further defence studies are being undertaken to consider the possibility of substantial additional savings by 1970-71.    To provide the total 110 P1127 aircraft which wouldbe necessary for the defence commitments envisaged in the defence review would cost  130 million more over a ten-year period than alikely alternative.     Such an alternative, although cheaper in budgetaryterms, could, however, involve expenditure of  40 million in dollars,plus perhaps a further  25 million for the foreign currency element ofthe additional Anglo-French Jaguars.    (Until the further defence studies are completed it is uncertain whether this requirement for a number ofP1127, or alternative aircraft, can be reduced:  it is thereforeimpossible to calculate with any precision the additional budgetary costof the P1127 and the cost in foreign exchange of the alternative.)Although the P1127 is desirable on grounds of operational efficiency the priority to be accorded to it on defence grounds alone isnot such as to justify its continuation in view of the pressure on theDefence Budget.    The incidence of expenditure on the P1127 wouldmoreover give rise to awkward budgetary problems in 1969-70 and1970-71 and although alternatives to it, giving us a similar capability,could also do this, there would be greater room for manoeuvre.    Ifthe continuation of the P1127 is approved, then the Defence Budget willbe higher than the total to which it could otherwise be reduced inconsequence of the Defence Review and the further defence studies.The argument for continuationThe argument for continuing with the P1127, apart from the gain in operational efficiency and the saving in foreign currency, is that it isthe only advanced military aircraft at present under development in theUnited Kingdom and the only major national aircraft project this government has initiated.    Its adoption as a part replacement for theHunter was intended to mitigate the cancellation of the TSR 2, P1154 andHS681,    K it were to be cancelled now the effect on the aircraft industry could be disastrous, particularly in the context of the uncertainty of thefuture of the Anglo-French variable geometry (VG) aircraft.    Althoughthe balance of probability is that the French will agree to the continuation of the latter, this is not certain, and if they withdrew we should then have to consider whether or not to continue with the development of a somewhat simpler form of this aircraft in the United Kingdom alone.This uncertainty is relevant to the future of the United Kingdom industry.-2-
Although the main work for a design team in the immediate future wouldbe on a VG aircraft and not on the P1127, the loss of confidence from theabandonment of the P1127 alone would be such that it is doubtful if menof the right industrial, scientific and technological standing could beretained in the industry.    In particular, this is the major project inthe programme for Hawker Siddeley,    It is around this firm, and itsmanagement, that the Governments proposals for reorganising the airframe industry are built.    If this project were now cancelled,Hawker Siddeley&apos;s willingness to remain in the industry could evaporate:in that event any prospect of an effective United Kingdom aircraft industry on the basis of the Governments proposals would disappear.Furthermore, the development of the VTOL and STOL capabilityis the only part of aircraft technology in which at present theUnited Kingdom is in advance of the rest of the world.    To abandon theP1127 would be permanently to throw away that lead, with widerconsequences for our technological capacity.Export ProspectsThe export prospects of the aircraft are necessarily uncertainuntil it is clear whether or not the Government intend to go ahead with production, since we cannot expect to sell military aircraft unless theRAF order them.    However, a number of countries have shown interest.The most promising prospects so far appear to be Israel, India and finland.    In general, the Head of Defence Sales considers the exportprospects are good but of course there can be no certainty of them.Numbers to be orderedIf a decision were taken in favour of the continuation of theprogramme there would then be a choice between ordering now 60 single and ten dual aircraft (essential for training purposes) at a programme costof  242 million while keeping an option open for a further purchase, thecost of which cannot be quantified until the end of the defence studies, orordering now the full number of 110 (including 17 duals) at a programmecost of  336 million.    The advantage of the former course is that itwould leave options open if the defence studies showed either a requirement for fewer than 110, or that alternative cheaper aircraft should be provided for the full remaining requirement.    The advantageof ordering the full 110 now is that if this number is required it would bemarginally cheaper and that it v/ould give greater industrial certaintyand enhance exports prospects.The ChoiceThe choice lies between:(l)     cancelling the P1127 and(2)    continuing the programme, in which case the choice is between:(a) ordering 70 aircraft now and keeping the option open on theremainder until mid-1967;  and(b) ordering the full 110 now.-3-
