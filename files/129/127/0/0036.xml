C(66) 177 COPY NO.2nd December, 1966CABINETBROAD CASTING POLICY AND DRAFT WHITE paper memorandum by the Postmaster GeneralThe Cabinet agreed (CC(66) 51st Conclusions, Minute 5) that the bbc should be asked to provide a popular music programme on an interim basis as soon as the legislation to suppress the pirate radio stations took effect, and approved in principle the proposal to establish a new broadcasting corporation, financed by advertising, to take over indue course the.running of the new programme from the BBC and toprovide a service of local sound broadcasting.    I was invited to discuss these proposals with the BBC and the Musicians&apos; Union.2,       After my many meetings with them I have concluded that it is extremely doubtful whether we could get the proposals, in their present form, off the ground.    What has emerged clearly is that they do not provide a basis on which an interim popular music programme couldbe established to coincide with the disappearance of the pirate stations.A number of other bodies have made representations to me and aregenerally opposed to the proposals.3,       The BBC have agreed, although with some reluctance, toco-operate in interim arrangements.    But the Musicians1 Union areunable to support the plan, and, if we went ahead with it, would offer the strongest opposition.     They have said in statements to the press that if necessary they would carry their opposition to the point of refusing to make gramophone records.4.       The Union do not believe there is a demand for additional sound broadcasting services.    They would nevertheless co-operate with the bbc in the provision of a national music programme and local sound broadcasting provided these services did not carry advertising.    Boththe BBC and the Union think that they could reach satisfactory agreement to that end.5.       But the Union are flatly opposed to new services financed byadvertising.    They believe that to make the services pay would require a much higher proportion of needle-time than that at present accorded to the BBC (about 20 per cent);  that, in the absence of agreement withthe Union, a commercially-based broadcasting authority would seekadditional needle-time by appeal to the Performing Right Tribunal;and that any award by the Tribunal would have to be applied also tothe BBC,COMF3 DEISTS ALUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
CONF3DENT3AL6.      For these reasons, the Union reject the view that new services,however financed, must create additional work for musicians.    they believe that the contrary would be true of services financed from advertising.    Their attitude is not narrowly protectionist.    It is part of their case that, if the opportunities for live performance     322are further diminished, the musical life of the country will in the longer term become impoverished.7,       I think there may very well be some substance in the Union&apos;sappraisal of the financial prospects of new services financed from advertising and of the consequent risks to their members1 interests.My colleagues will recall that the estimates of income in C(66) 141assumed 50 per cent needle-time, and even on that basis thefinancial viability of the new corporation was not clearly assured,A  5 million Exchequer loan was required for the new corporation,and even by the fourth year it was uncertain whether the corporation^income would match its current expenditure.    As to the Union&apos;sbelief that any award by the Tribunal would apply also to the BBC,it is the case that under their present needle-time agreement the bbc are entitled to terms not less favourable than those grantedto any other broadcasting body in the United Kingdom.8.       I have had discussions also with representatives of the recordmanufacturers.    They have made it quite clear to me that they havea common interest with the Musicians&apos; Union in not wishing their products to be given too great an exposure over the air.    Subjectto that, their disposition is to give us all the help they can in the furtherance of our plans.    But in the last resort they are dependenton recording artistes and hence on the Musicians&apos; Union,    Their ownassessment is that the Union can and will block the present plan, ifnecessary by refusing to make records.    Even a relatively shortstrike v/ould inflict lasting damage on the British gramophone recordindustry and the important export trade would suffer.9.       It is possible to take the view that the Union would not, in theevent, call a strike, and that the long-term risk can be discounted.But the balance of the opinion I have consulted is that they probablywould strike.    If this happened, it would probably be in 1968 or1969 after we had passed legislation and set up the new corporation.However that may be, in the short term there is no prospect that theUnion would co-operate with the BBC in arrangements for an interimmusic programme between the closing of the pirate stations and thetime when the new corporation began to broadcast.    Without their co-operation neither the BBC, nor anyone else, could provide a popular music programme at the time when the legislation againstthe pirate stations takes effect.    In my view, this consideration isparamount.    The need can only be met if we authorise the BBC toprovide the music programme on a longer-term basis.     This wouldmoreover be by far the least expensive way of providing the service,10.      My colleagues will recall that if the BBC were called on toprovide the music programme they would do so by arranging for theLight Programme transmission on 247 metres to continue in musicwhenever the long-wave transmission carried the spoken word.    Theywould now propose to extend this arrangement to other periods whenthe long-wave transmission carried music of a kind unlikely to appealto a youthful audience; and to make other changes designed to givethe programme the new and popular character needed.    As nowplanned it would provide throughout most of the day continuous music,much of it of the kind young people prefer,
11.       Turning now to local sound broadcasting, it is clear that local stations must have an inexpensive source of music as backing material.Whether this took the form of gramophone records or a &quot;feed1 from themusic programme the Musicians&apos; Union would be in a position to blockit.12.      Again it is possible to take the view that we should call theUnion&apos;s bluff.    But my colleagues will recall that local sound broad-casting and the music programme are the only new developments to be announced in the forthcoming White Paper.     They would lose much oftheir value, particularly during the passage of the anti-pirate Billthr ough the House, if their credibility were challenged by the Union.13.      I have therefore considered whether the local sound broad-casting service could be financed in some other way than by advertsing.Subvention from the rates would be wrong from every point of view.But there are, I feel no doubt, many local bodies which would beprepared to make a financial contribution to the cost of a station byway of payment for the general promotion of their objectives.    these would include the local authority, particularly for education services;the local University where there is one;  the Open University;Chambers of Trade and Commerce;  local Councils of Churches;arts associations;  and other representative bodies active in the social and cultural life of the community.    Although the local authority would no doubt be a major contributor it would be for services rendered bythe station and not by way of subvention.    It is only right, in my view,that stations which could make a unique contribution to the life andculture of the communities they serve should receive their financial support from these communities and not from the general body oflie enc e -holder s.14,       I have therefore discussed the possibilities with the Secretaryof the Association of Municipal Corporations who has since takenconfidential soundings of a number of local authorities.    As was tobe expected, the reactions of the authorities varied a good deal.    Butthere is a good prospect of establishing stations in a number oflocalities, financed in this way.    Time is needed to explore thepossibilities more fully and to quantify the sources of income.    Ipropose therefore that the BBC should establish a limited number of stations (say, nine) on an experimental footing, to determine among other things whether this method of financing offers a basis for apermanent service of sufficient extent.    If the experience showed that local sources, without recourse to advertising, were not enough,we should have to re-examine the alternatives,15.      I have discussed this proposal with the BBC and they v/ould beprepared to carry out an experiment on a footing that would afford toLocal Broadcasting Councils, widely representative of the community,the maximum possible voice in the direction and performance of the stations.    As part of the experiment they would explore, in consul-tation with the Local Broadcasting Councils, the possibilities of localself-financing for a permanent service.    The experiment could getunder way before the end of 1967 and would continue for a year or so.The BBC have assured me that any part of the cost of the localbroadcasting experiment that cannot be financed locally could,together with the cost of the music programme, be accommodated within their plans for continuing without an increase in the licence fee until after the end of 1967,-3-
16.      As an alternative to provision by the BBC I have considered whether the local stations could be directly licensed.    There are anumber of objections to such a scheme but the decisive consideration is that it would establish new broadcasting bodies by administrative action.    Not only would this involve a dubious use of my licensingpowers but it would create a precedent for any future Governmentwhich might wish to establish commercial sound broadcasting withoutspecific Parliamentary authority.    Another alternative would be tobring the local stations under the general oversight of a new regulatorybody (on the ITA pattern).    This is a possibility that we may need tokeep in mind for the future, but I think my colleagues would agree thatit would be inappropriate to set up a body of this kind for the purposesof a limited experiment.    The White Paper would in any case make itclear that, in deciding that the BBC should conduct the experiment,we implied no commitment that the Corporation should provide apermanent service, if it were decided to authorise one.17.      In sum, my recommendations are:(i) That the BBC should provide a new music programme to comeinto operation when the legislation against the pirate stationstakes effect.That the BBC should be authorised to carry out a 9-stationexperiment in local sound broadcasting to determine, among other things, the sources of local revenue that would beavailable to support a permanent service in a wide range oflocalities.18.      I invite my colleagues to agree that the draft White Paperannexed, which has been revised to embody these recommendations,should be published as soon as possible.E.S.(ii)General Post Office, E.C.1.1st December, 1966
Anne:Draft White PaperBROADCASTINGIntroduction1,     The Government have had under review various manor aspectsof broadcasting policy.   First among them was the question of the3BC*s finances.   Besides this, there were various proposals forthe further extension of the broadcasting services; that thereshould be a fourth television service; that a service of localsound broadcasting should be introduced; and that there should bean extra service of sound broadcasting entirely given over tomusic.2.     The Government have thought it best to consider them as a comprehensive whole.    For two other major questions it was howeverdesirable for the Government to publish their views before thegeneral review was completed.   A Bill to put an end to theactivities of pirate radio stations has already been introduced.And on colour television, the Postmaster General announced on 3rd March last the decision that a service using the PAL trans--mission system and broadcast on the 625-line standard would starttowards the end of next year.3.     In reaching the conclusions announced in this review, it hasof course been the Government&apos;s duty to consider both what purposes the proposals for further extending the broadcasting services should seek to serve, and what organisation would best- promote those purposes.    The Government have also- had to consider to what extent it would be in the national economic interest to allow theseextensions.    It is not enough that they should be desirable in themselves.    The overriding consideration is whether the country can afford them.THE FINANCES OP THE BBCThe BBCs request for an increase in the licence foek.     Following the report of the Pilkington Committee in 1962, the bbc were authorised;(a) to provide an additional television service - bbc;(b) td provide self-contained television services forScotland and Wales;(c) greatly to increase the number of hours for which itsThird Programme/Network Three broadcasts.   It nowbroadcasts throughout the day;(d) to&apos;^extend the Light Programme.    It now broadcasts from5-30 a.m. until 2 a,m.;1.
(e) to provide more programmes of adult education on television.    Both BBC and ITA have made full use of thisauthorit y; and(f) to start colour television on bbc,The decision to authorise these major developments was welcomed;and, except for colour television - which is to start next year -they either have been or are being carried into effect.5.     Also, the BBC are developing stereophonic broadcasts of programmes in the very high frequency (VHF ) transmission of theThird Network.6.     The understanding on which the BBC proceeded to carry out thesemajor developments was that they would he afforded sufficient income to finance adequate services.    In their Annual Report for 1962-63?the Corporation record that if they had received the full proceeds of a  5 licence from 1st April 1963? for which they had asked, theycould have financed their services out of income until the end ofthe nineteen sixties-.    The Corporations request was not granted,but from October 1963, when the Government of the day relinquishedthe  1 annual excise duty, an amount equal to the whole of the netproceeds of a  4 licence became payable to the Corporation.7.     In October 1964, the BBC represented to the Government thatthe combined television and sound licence fee should be raised from  4 to  6, and the sound-only fee from  1 to  1 5s.   It was,of course, the Government&apos;s duty first to satisfy themselves that increases of this order would be justified.   But it was also plain that some immediate action was called for to put the BBC in funds.The Government therefore decided that there should be a closeenquiry into the Corporation^ finances, but, as an interim measure,also authorised increases in the combined licence fee from  4 to 53 and in the sound-only fee from  1 to  1 5s.   Both increasestook effect on 1st August 1965.The Government&apos;s enquiry8,   The Government have completed their enquiry into the BBCsfinances.    Practically speaking, the only possible ways ofproviding finance for the BBC ares by direct Government subvention,by the sale of advertising time in the Corporations services, orby the licence-fee system.9.   A Government subvention would be liable to expose theCorporation to financial control in such detail as would proveincompatible with the BBCs independence.    The money would, ofcourse, have to be found from general taxation.10. Under their Licence and Agreement (Cmnd.2236) the BBC are not allowed to broadcast commercial advertisements without first havingsought and obtained the Postmaster Generalfs permission,   Becauseof the probable long-term effect on the character of their services the BBC have never sought this permission.    The Government recall&quot;that the Pilkington Committee found against the financing of theSBC in any measure from advertising, and that this view commandedgeneral acceptance.U.   The Government have decided that there should be no changeat present in the arrangement whereby the BBC are financed throughthe licence fee system.   But at a time when none may be content torest wgon present standards of efficiency and financial performance,good though they may be, the Government have thought it right to2.
rexpect of the BBC that they should set themselves even moreexacting financial objectives.    They have accordingly asked them whether, assuming the expenditure ceiling which would be impliedif there were   no increase in the licence fee for the present, thyCorporation would be able to maintain their present services? and&apos;to proceed with extensions and developments either already authorised or proposed below.    The BBO have reported that, by making special economies, they will - on certain assumptions - beable to do so until 1968 when they would need an increase of  1.12*   In order to make these special economies, the BBC will restrictactivities which they have hitherto considered, well justified but which, against the background of continued financial stringency,can be sacrificed to the overriding national need for economy.The Corporation have conducted a searching examination of all their ancillary services and operating, with a view to making themaximum retrenchment in detail.    By itself, however, this will notsuffice.    Some larger scale projects, desirable in themselves, forenlarging and modernising the Corporation^ programme production capacity, will be forgone for the present.   But the BBC will beable to maintain their present level of programme output and toproceed with extensions and developments of their services already authorised or about to be authorised.Licence evasion13.   One assumption on which the BBC have based their undertaking to manage without an immediate increase in the licence fee is thatcounter measures against licence evasion will prove effective.,It has been reliably estimated that, of the gross revenue amountingto some  80m. payable in a full year, some  9m. is lost throughevasion.    This is far too much to be tolerated.   Honest viewersand listeners are, in effect, paying for the dishonesty of theevaders.Ik.   Steps have already been taken by the Postmaster General to tighten up counter evasion measures, but, by themselves, they willnot suffice.   Further measures are required^, The Government arereviewing the penalties which Magistrates may impose on convictedevaders, and are discussing with the associations representingretailers and the rental companies ways in which dealers could helpin the enforcement of the licence system,   The Government willannounce their proposals as soon as these dicussions have beencompleted; and legislation will be brought before Parliament inthe current session.BBC finances conclusion15.   The Government recognise the efforts which the Corporation aremaking to defer their request for an increase in the licence fee.The increase will be required in due course, but, given the combinedeffoci of the special economies to be secured by the BBC and of thefurther measures to be taken to combat licence-evasion, theGovernment are satisfied that no increase in the fee will berequired before 1968.A FOURTH TELEVISION SERVICE16.   Ultimately, the frequencies now available for television couldaccommodate six services of near-national coverage on the 62.5-linedefinition standard; two in the very high frequency (VHF ) bands;and four in the \iltra-high frequency (UHF) bands.   At present, the3.
19.    The Government have decided that no allocation of frequenciesto a fourth television service will be authorised for the next three years at any rate.TELEVISION FOR THE OPEN UNIVERSITY20,   Besides the claim of independent television to the frequenciesrequired for a fourth television service network, there is also thepossibility that the network would be required for a specialisedservice of educational television, forming part of the structure ofthe Open University.    The decision to reserve the fourth networkwould enable the requirements of the Open University to beappraised more closely in the light of practicable experience.COLOUR TELEVISION21.   The Government have already announced the decision that colour television, using the PAL transmission system and the 625-linedefinition standard should be provided.    The service is to starttowards the end of next year on bbc.    In reaching this conclusion the Government saw as an important consideration the prospect ofincreasing exports - provided that an early start could be made.22.   In making this announcement, the Postmaster General stated thatif the Oslo conference of the International Radio consultative committee were to show that another transmission system found general acceptance, the Government would take such a development intoconsideration.    In the event, the conference-did not reach a commonview on any transmission system.    In general, the countries of western Europe expressed a preference for the PAL system, and france and eastern Europe for the SECAM III system.   Accordingly,in the United Kingdom the colour service will be provided on thePAL system.VHF  bands are occupied by bbc and independent television, bothbroadcast on 405-lines.    Of the four 625-line- networks possible inUHF, one is committed to bbc.    There is therefore tuiused frequencyspace in the HHP bands for three more 625-line services.    Space for two of them must be reserved in case it is required in order to change over the existing i+05-line services to 625-lines by theduplication method.    This means that the present basis on which planning must proceed is that, for the next 10 to 15 years,frequencies will certainly be available for only one additionaltelevision service of near-national coverage, in UEF and on625-lines.17.   When the Television Act 1963 was before Parliament, theGovernment of the day stated their intention to allocate this service to a second programme of independent television during1965 unless the financial or other obstacles were insurmountable.However it were allocated, a fourth television service would makelarge demands on resources.    The three main services of televisionalready provide a large volume of programmes of various kinds andthe Government do not consider that another television service canbe afforded a high place in the order of national priorities.l8.   Moreover, before deploying the last frequencies certainlyavailable for television for many years to come, the Governmentwould need to be satisfied that the case for committing them toany new service had been fully established.
23.    It has always &quot;been recognised that the decision to providecolour television on the 625-line definition standard is closely related to the intention to change over the two 405-line servicesof bbc and independent television - to 625-lines9    ThePostmaster General!s Television Advisory Committee has been askedto -report as soon as possible on the method of changeover to beadopted^.    It may well be that this will involve duplicating theexisting 405-line programmes on 625-line lines in UHP,2k,   It is the Government&apos; s view that the cost of colour programmes which are likely at the outset t o o e a va x lable only to a small minority of viewers because of the cost cf receivers? should not fall upon viewers in general.   Accordingly a supplementary licence fee of  5 will be required from those equipped to receive colourprogrammes,5.
Sound Radiof).   The BBC broadcast three programmes - the Home Service, thetight Programme and the Third Network.    Complementary planningbroadly ensures that, at any given time, listeners have an effectivechoice between programmes of different kinds;    and, between them,the three programmes cater for a wide span of tastes and interests,ranging from those which attract very large audiences to those which,seing highly specialized, serve small audiences.    The threeprogrammes are widely regarded as very well suited to their function of providing a comprehensive service of sound-radio on a national basis.A popular music programme26.   That there is an audience for continuous music as popularentertainment is not now.    What is new is that, by appropriatingwavelengths allotted to other countries and by largely disregardingcopyright in gramophone records, the pirate stations have been ableto&quot;exploit the fact.    Legislation to end the activities of these stations has been introduced.    The Government recognise that there is,however, a need for a new service devoted to the provision of a continuous popular music programme.    The question is how the need canlegitimately be met; legitimately in that it would be broadcast onlyon wavelengths available under international agreement to thiscountry, and in that it would respect the rights of performers,composers and others in the material broadcast.27.   It is necessary to weigh also any implications for presentservices to the listening public generally; and, in particular,whether the need to provide frequencies on which to transmit a popular music programme would involve an unacceptable curtailment of the present services of sound broadcasting.Because a popular music programme does not need to differ fromiplace to place, the most economical way of broadcasting it will beby relatively few stations, each with a large transmission area.&quot;h&apos;3 characteristics of wavelengths in the Medium Wave band suit themto this objective.   But, as the medium wavelengths available to thiscountry are already intensively used, room for an extra service canonly be found by redemploying them.    There is not room enough in themfor all the present sound-radio services and for a popular musicprogramme with anything like sufficient coverage.Hg29.   The Government have therefore discussed with the BBC whatRearrangement of their services they would need to make in order tofind room for the additional service.    In the past, the Corporation&apos;iave considered that they could best serve their various audiencesby providing the Light Programme on both long and medium wavelengths,in order to-attain the widest possible coverage at an acceptablestandard of reception.    Now, however, that the long-wave transmission of the Light Programme is reinforced by the bbc s very high frequencyIvHF) transmissions, which have themselves attained virtuallypomplete population coverage, and now that portable VHF  transistorpts, at reasonable cost, are available, the Corporation feel free[0 uevote the medium-wave channel of 2hl metres to a oopular musicprogramme.P.   The BEG have informed the Government that, on weekdays, therograrmne would broadcast popular music continuously from 5.30 a.m. tobr tv.P&quot;&apos; and asain from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. , and on Sundays, for mostla\ day&apos;s oroadcasting.    Over six hours of music each day would beayed from gramophone records.    The remainder would be   either liveaacasts or BBC recordings of popular music especially made for theeet+f&apos;   The ProSramme would provide each day a blend of output totne needs of the audience for popular music,6.
38.&amp;ovproceed is by way of experiment.In considering how an experiment should be conducted, theernment have had regard not only to the need to avoid an excessive7.In the Government&apos; s view, the provision of a popular musicrn-ramme on the medium wavelength, 2kl metres, would, on an overallKrai sal, provide an extension of choice to the listener.    TheyJill authorise the BBC to provide the new service at an early date.Local   sound   radiow    No general service of local sound broadcasting&quot;, which wouldbe&apos;available during hours of darkness as well as in daylight, canbe -provided only on medium wavelengths allotted to the UnitedKingdom.   The only possibility for such a service lies in VHF.    In-ractical terms, some 150 towns and cities could be served.    Ofthe proposals put to the Government for the provision of a service,some advocate that it should be provided by commercial companies,others that it should be provided by the BBC.33.   In a worthwhile service of broadcasting a local station should,the Pilkington Committee concluded, transmit &quot;for a sufficient partof the broadcasting day /material/ of particular interest to thecommunity served by that station rather than to other localities.&quot;In their White Paper of July 1962 (Cmnd. 1770) the conservative administration agreed &quot;that the justification for local sound broadcasting would be the provision of a service genuinely &apos;local&apos;in character&quot;.    The Government share this view.34.   They consider that this objective would prove incompatible withthe commercial objectives of companies engaging in local sound broadcasting; and that, in the result, the former would be likely to suffer.    In their view it is of first importance to maintain publicservice principles in the further development of the broadcasting services; and accordingly they reject the view that a service oflocal sound radio should be provided by commercial companies.35.   Evidence of the expertise and professional enthusiasm which the bbc would bring to local sound broadcasting is to be found in the trial 1 programmes&apos; they have prepared.    They lend much support to theview that, properly organised, local radio would provide a valuableservice to the local community; and, by giving a new means of expression to its particular interest and aspirations, serve to reinforce its distinctive character and sense of identity.36.   The Government believe that local radio, organised and producedas a public service, would be most likely to realise those socialpurposes to the full; and would at its best prove an integrating andeducative force in the life of the local community.   But it is, theyconsider, important to establish how far the claim for a localstation is likely to rest on genuinely local initiative having these purposes as its objective; and how far local sources of &quot;finance arelikely to be available to meet the expenditure required by such an initiative.    In sum, not only is it important to establish that alocal service of high quality could be maintained, month-in, month-out.   There is also the question whether it would command enoughsupport, including financial support, to justify the development of a service on a widespread and permanent footing,37.   The Government consider that more information is required beforennal judgments are made on the way in which this new service would^constituted and organised.   Moreover, this is not the right time atwaieh to authorise a further and large-scale extension of thecountry&apos;s broadcasting services.   Valuable though it may be in itself,&quot; cannot at present command a high place in the order of nationalpriorities.   The Government have therefore decided that the right way
I diversion of resources for the ourpose hut also to the undesirability10f entering a commitment at this stage to any permanent form of constitution and organisation.    They conclude that these variousreauirements will best be met if the experiment is conducted by tneBBC as a venture in co-operation with local interests; and they have therefore decided to authorise the BBC to go ahead with a nine-station project, in VHF .    The stations would offer a full-scale localservice.    They would come into operation after about a year; andafter a year or so of operation,  should have provided the information on which to found the final solution.39.   To secure co-operation with local interests, theexperimentalservice will be provided in the closest association with them.    Foreach station, there will be a local Broadcasting Council appointedby the Postmaster General in consultation with the BBC,   EachCouncil will be widely representative of the community - includingyouth - and will play a fully formative part in the development of programme policy and content.   The Government attach great importanceto the need to ensure that the stations are local in character andnot all moulded to a common pattern imposed from the centre; and the bbc have assured the Government that the Coi;ncils will have themaximum possible voice in the direction and performance of the stations.AO.   It is the Governmenfs hope that the stations would, wherever possible, afford local professional musicians the opportunity ofcontributing live performances to the programme output of theservice.   In this way, the stations would help to provide a widebasis on which to rest the musical culture of the country.M.   Since the essential purpose of the local station is to giveexpression to local interests and aspirations, it seems right thatits income should derive so far as is possible from local sources;but excluding direct subvention from the rates, and income from commercial advertisements.    There are in local life various bodieswho might well be prepared to make a financial contribution to the costs of the station, in consideration of the general promotionthrough its programmes of their objectives:   the local authority,particularly for its educational services; the local university, wherethere is one; the Open University; Chambers of Trade and Commerce;Local Councils of Churches; Arts Associations; and otherrepresentative bodies active in the social and cultural life of thecommunity.    An important purpose of the experiment will be toestablish whether enough financial support will be forthcoming fromthese sources.p2.   The Government reserve until the conclusion of the experiment;ariy decision on the question whether a general or permanent service should be authorised, and, if so, how it should be&quot;constituted,organised and financed and by whom provided.    The decision that thePC should conduct the experiment implies no commitment that theJ-orporation should provide a permanent service, if it were decided to[authorise one.PAY TVj3.   The Conservative Government authorised an experiment to lastKrmn ye?r? and Slanted a licence which will not expire beforeK?  t7   9d9&apos;    The Government agree with this decision but they willfciewo        a situation to develop in which the vast majority ofWi?nS ^ denied the viewing of major sporting events.    Somewhat*^mo .^ssues are raised by the showing over closed circuit televisionporting events to audiences in cinemas and other public places.8.
I+3.   Both the BBC and ITA are public corporations, whollyresponsible for the content of their programmes and for the day-to-day conduct of their affairs.    The principles that the public corporations should be independent of the Government has beenupheld by successive Administrations since the beginning of broadcasting in the United Kingdom.    The Government adhere to thisconcept.k10.   The Government has discussed with the broadcasting authorisies,and with other parties in Parliament, the idea of establishing,subject to this governing principle, a council to consider general issues of broadcasting policy.    They have concluded that additionalmachinery of this sort would serve little useful purpose if theindependence of the two public corporations is to be maintained.Since full responsibility is required of them, they must be affordedfull authority to secure that their services are conducted in thegeneral interest.50.   Though Parliament has pla.ced them in competition with eachother, they have a common objective of public service.    In the continuing task of realising this objective matters of common concern are bound to arise.   To discuss matters of this kind, theChairman of the BBC and the Chairman of the ITA have, the Governmentunderstand, established regular and frequent meetings.    The twobroadcasting authorities have now decided to put these meetings ona more formal footing and to use them as the occasion for discussingmatters which either Chairman might wish to raise.    The meetingswill continue to be private and unpubliciscd.51. The Government welcome this means of consultation between thetwo authorities and their ready recognition that they will benefitirom an understanding by each authority of the other&apos;s view,9.HOURS OP BROADCASTINGlik.    The first White Paper (Cmnd. 1770) on the report of the pilkington Committee stated that the Postmaster General&quot;s powersto control the hours of broadcasting would continue.    In the television Act, 1963, and in the BBCs Licence and Agreement,approved by Parliament in January 1964, these powers were re-enacted in a more detailed form.45.    It has been represented to the Government that, ideally,these powers should not be used, but held as a reserve power.Both the ITA and the BBC would then be free to broadcast for as many hours a day as they chose.    The Government have also considered whether, instead, there might be authorised a large increase inthe number of hours of broadcasting a week.I;.6.    In a typical week BBC 1, independent television and BBC 2broadcast for some 130 to 200 hours in total.    The amount of television broadcast here compares favourably with that of anyother Western European country and considerably exceeds that of most.kl. In the Government&apos;s view, the amount of broadcasting time willremain a matter of sufficient social importance to require that thePostmaster General should continue to hold and exercise his present powers of control. Nor do the Government consider that any general increase in broadcasting hours will be justified for the present.They do not, however, rule out the possibility of more time for educational programmes.T7EBROADCASTING AUTH02ITIESs    THEIR COMMONRESPONSIBILITIES
