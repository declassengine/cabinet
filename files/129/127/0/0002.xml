IMPORT ARRANGEMENTS FOR APPLES AND PEARSMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI have to ask the Cabinet to resolve a difference of view whichhas arisen in the Sub-Committee on External Economic Policy of the ministerial Committee on Economic Development, relating to proposalsfor liberalising the quota arrangements for imports of apples and pears.I am submitting this memorandum summarising the opposing viewssince, in the absence of the First Secretary of State, I acted as Chairmanof the Sub-Committee on the three occasions when this issue was discussed.2.     For apples and pears, the real protection is by quota from all sources except the sterling area, since there is no tariff on imports ofapples (and only a nominal one on pears) during the home marketingseason and only a modest tariff on both apples and pears during theSouthern Hemisphere marketing season, as a matter of imperial preference.    The present quota levels for apples are 15,200 tons forthe period July to December, and 68,750 tons for the period January toJune.    For pears, there is an annual quota of 28,000 tons.    these restrictions in common with similar restrictions imposed by continental countries are contrary to our obligations under GATT.    The Sub-Committee on External Economic Policy discussed a possible basis of liberalisation contained in a report submitted without commitment by officials of all the departments concerned at a meeting on 27th June and again on 25th July and agreed by a majority that revised quota arrange-ments should be introduced as from 1st January, 1967 as follows;-(a) An apple quota of 37, 000 tons for the months of January and february.(b) Thereafter a quota-free period for both apples and pearscovering the months from March to July inclusive.(c) The present six-monthly apple quota of 15,200 tons to applyto the five months from August to December inclusive.(d) The present annual pear quota of 28, 000 tons to apply to the seven months from August to February inclusive.The implementation of these conclusions was, however, subject to theresults of consultations with the Australian and New Zealand. governments which we are under obligation to carry out before altering the present arrangements.-1-IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 143 COPY NO.     &quot; &apos;18th October, 1966CABINET
3.     These consultations have now been completed and in addition theCanadian Government and the National Farmers Union (NFU) have been consulted.    Australia and New Zealand, while recognising that the quotaswould have to be terminated eventually, criticised the proposed changeson the ground that they would result in increased quantities of fruit beingstored by Northern Hemisphere suppliers (particularly France and Italy)for export to the United Kingdom in the early part of the proposed free-entry period of March to July, to the detriment of Southern HemisphereSuppliers,    The Canadian Government found the proposals unacceptableon the grounds that they were more interested in export opportunitiesbefore Christmas but they asked, if we went ahead with proposals on thelines envisaged, that there should be a higher quota for the months ofJanuary/February.    The NFU challenged the proposals to admit moreimports as contrary to the import saving role allotted to the home industry under the National Plan.    They argued that the proposals could lead to heavy imports from Europe and low prices at the beginning and end ofthe home marketing season; and the southern hemisphere countries might, in consequence, feel unable to continue their long standingarrangement under which their exports are timed not to overlap withthe beginning of the English crop.4.     The Sub-Committee discussed the result of these consultationsat their meeting on 17th October and a difference of view emerged.    TheMinister of Agriculture, supported by the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State, Commonwealth Office, felt that the proposals should not be pursued at the present time.    His reasons can be summarised as follows(a) The revised quotas would seriously damage the interests ofhome growers who have been encouraged by the Governmentto grow more fruit and to invest in better storage facilities and could lead to a loss of confidence and a setback in home production.(b) It was doubtful if any significant benefit to the balance of payments would result, and home growers would regard a move towardsliberalisation at this time as being in contradiction to the presentneed for import saving.(c) The proposals would also adversely affect our suppliers inAustralia and New Zealand who incurred losses on sales at last season&apos;slevel of supplies and the representations of their governments on this point must be taken seriously.(d) The proposed arrangements would expose us to dumping from france and Italy.    Any benefit to the consumer by way of lower prices would be short-lived because the long-termeffect would be to prejudice the maintenance of supplies fromthe Southern Hemisphere on which we depend for a substantial part of the year,(e) Supplies from English, Australian and New Zealand growershave expanded in the past ten years and growers&apos; prices have not risen.    There has been no question of shortagesand high prices in the United Kingdom Market.    The realproblem is the surpluses which have built up in the past fewyears in France and Italy where new plantings have been encouraged for political reasons.    There is a serious risk-2-
that these supplies would be dumped and that our market would collapse if we relaxed our restrictions on importswhile other countries maintained theirs.    This problemcan only be solved by international negotiations in the kennedy round, as we proposed in our offer last August, leading tosome regulation of supplies and allround reductions of barriersto trade.    Exploratory discussions on the United Kingdomproposal have already begun in Geneva and it is important that we should lose no opportunity to get a settlement onthis basis.    It would make nonsense, and suggest that wehave no faith in our own proposal i 9 on the eve of negotiationsabout it the United Kingdom were to take unilateral actionwhich would be irrelevant to the real problem of worldsurpluses which we are seeking to discuss.    Such action would materially damage the interests of the British,Australian and New Zealand grov/ers and would get no thanksfrom France and Italy.The Minister of Agriculture therefore felt that the action proposed wasunwise and untimely and that we should instead concentrate on pursuingthe broader objective in the Kennedy Round negotiations.5.     The view of the Board of Trade, supported by the Treasury, theForeign Office and the Department of Economic Affairs, was that weshould adhere to the Sub**Committee&apos;s provisional decision at its earliermeetings.   While Ministers from these departments thought that there might be a case for increasing the proposed quota for January/Februaryfrom 37, 000 tons to 40, 000 in deference to the Canadians&apos;views, they didnot press this in view of the Minister of Agriculture&apos;s objections.    Thereasons for the view taken by these Ministers may be summarised asfollows s-(a) The reactions of those we have consulted were on the lineswe expected.    No new factor had emerged which was not present in ministers minds when the issue   was discussed on previous occasions.(b) We must have regard first and foremost to the effects of theproposed measures on our balance of payments.    While thesecannot be precisely quantified, it was thought possible thatthe introduction of the revised arrangements might produceimport savings ranging between  200,000 and  500^000.(c) The effect of the existing quotas was to maintain prices ofapples and pears (and hence of other fruit) at artificiallyhigh levels.    A move towards liberalisation would thereforebring advantages for the home consumer.(d) The interests of home growers would not be significantlyprejudiced because quotas would remain for the period ofthe home marketing season.(e) Apples and pears were unlikely to figure to any appreciable extent in the Kennedy Round negotiations.    We could not inany case expect to get any substantial quid pro quo in returnfor liberalising restrictions which are contrary to our obligations under GATT,-3-
The majority view on the Sub-Committee was therefore that we should go ahead with the revised quota arrangements,conclusion.     If we are to introduce revised arrangements, an announcement should be made in the next week or so to give the industry reasonablewarning.    I therefore invite the Cabinet to decide whether -(a) an announcement should now be made that revised quotas asset out in paragraph 2 above will be introduced from 1st January, 1967; or(b) no change should be made in existing arrangements for thecoming year, thus leaving time for discussions in the kennedy Round.D.
