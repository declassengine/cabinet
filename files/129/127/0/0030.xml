DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)MODALITIES OF THE VISITS BY THE PRIME MINISTER ANDTHE FOREIGN SECRETARY TO THE CAPITALS OF THE SIXMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in Cabinet on 9th November I undertook to circulate a paper on themodalities of the visits by the Prime Minister and myself to the capitalsof the Six,2.       Between now and the Christmas holidays we already have theEuropean Free Trade Association (EFTA) Prime Ministers Meeting(4th/5th December), the Meeting of the North Atlantic Council(13th - l6th/17th December) and the Ministerial Council of western european Union (l9th/20th December);  though I will probably not be goingto the latter myself, many of the Foreign Ministers of the Six will be doing so.    In view of these commitments I do not think it practicable that thePrime Minister and myself should start this series of visits until January.3.       However, I think we should aim at visiting two capitals before thePrime Minister delivers his speech to the Consultative Assembly inStrasbourg (23rd/27th January).4.       There is therefore a little time in which to consider the order ofthe visits.    This is a convenience because it should enable us to see how the political situation in Germany develops.5.       Meanwhile we should not leave the Community Governmentswithout a word from us, or we may give the impression of dwindlingmomentum and encourage speculation about the reasons for apparentinactivity.    After consulting the Prime Minister, I am therefore sendingmessages to the Six Foreign Ministers, as my colleagues, saying that thePrime Minister and I look forward to visiting them at mutually convenienttimes, but that we think that engagements already existing make this toodifficult before Christmas;  and that we shall be consulting them in a week or two about exact dates.    This would also enable us to answer pressenquiries by saying that we were already in touch with the Governmentsof the Six.6.       I propose to circulate a further report when the Prime ministers and my plans have progressed further.C(66)17122nd November, 1966COPY NO.cabinet . B.Foreign Office, S.
