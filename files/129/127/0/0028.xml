W. 1.15th November, 1966
SPACE POLICYReport by the Official Committee on Science and technology.     The issues relevant to our space policy have been summarised in an earlier report to Ministers (attached to C(65) 180).     This further reportseeks to reassess these issues in the light of subsequent developments sothat Ministers may consider against that background -(a) what resources should be devoted to our space programme as awhole, having regard to expenditure on research and development in other fields of technology;(b) the balance of the present space programme;(a)   the base for the continuation of the BLACK ARB.0Y/ and nationalspace technological programme;(d) whether we should participate in the proposed programme of theEuropean Conference on Satellite Communications (CETS) for thecollaborative development of a  European communications satellite;and(e) whether we should participate in a United States/Europeanadvanced space project,A.     Space programmes in relation to other technological developments2.     Leaving aside defence expenditure on space ( 2,7 million in 1966-7) whichis mainly for participation in a world-wide military communicationssatellite system and which vd.ll be met from the defence budget, the present estimated expenditure by Government Departments and the Post Office on approved space programmes for 1966-7 is  18.8 million, (Table l).     The total estimated expenditure on civil research and development (including space)in the public sector for 1966-7, is  292 million (Table 2).     This includesexpenditure in the Universities ( 48 million), and by the nationalised industries and public corporations including the Post Office ( 29 million).Thus, the space programme amounts to 6,4 per cent of the total.   this compares with Atomic Energy Authority programmes 17*5 per cent, research councils 19.5 per cent, Universities 16.5 per cent, and the Ministry of technology programmes (excluding atomic energy) 6.3 per cent, (Table 2).3.     Our expenditure on space (about .065 per cent of &amp;NP) is of course trivialin comparison with that spent by the United States (estimated  1.790 million in 1966, which is 61.1+ per cent of all civil research and development expenditure paid by Federal funds and 0.8 per cent of GNP).     However,although it is comparable to that estimated by France ( 25.6 million0.09 per cent OKP) and Germany ( 21.30 million, 0.06 per cent) their contributions to international programmes is a much smaller proportion oftheir total (39 and 60 per cent respectively), than it is of ours
(86 per cent).     The stated cost of the Japanese space programme( 4.58 million in 1966) is only a quarter as much as that of the UnitedKingdom, hut this appears to be considerably under-estimated and the realcost is unknown:   nevertheless the Japanese hope to achieve a satellitecapability from this modest programme.4.     About 940 qualified scientists and engineers are at present engaged on research and development on the civil space programme, of whom 350 areintramural.     This compares with a total of 14,500 qualified scientists,engineers and technologists employed on research and development by theCentral Government, nationalised industries and public corporations(including the sea).     That is, the intramural staff of the public sectorworking on space represent 2.4 per cent of the total.     The total number of qualified scientists and engineers engaged on research and development inthe manufacturing industry in 1965 was 37,000;   of which 11,300 were employed by the aircraft and electronics industries;   thus the extramuralprofessional staff of 590 employed on our space programme was just over  per cent of those in the latter two industries.     The total labour forceemployed on space work in British industry in 1964 was estimated at 3*000about 1 per cent of the work force in the aircraft and electronicindustries,&apos;V.\Bo    The balance of the space programmes as a whole5.   Our resources do not permit our activities in space to cover the wholefield, and we seek to relate them to those particular aspects which most closely affect our national interests.     Excluding military uses (whereeur major interest is in communications), these are scientific space research and satellite communications.6.     Our scientific space research programme consists of basic research in the Universities, work at the Radio and Space Research Station and, in collaboration with the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, the launching of a scientific satellite (UK3X  We also participate in theEuropean Space Research Organisation (ESRO) to which we are bound by itsConvention to contribute a proportion (currently 25 per cent) of its expenditure which is subject to a ceiling of  110 million over eight years(until 1972).     The total estimated cost for&quot; all these programmes in1966-7 is  5.5 million, rising to  7.25 million in 1971-2. (Table 1).-2-
7.     On satellite communications we have no direct work in progress aimed at communications satellite technology, but our expertise has benefitedover the last three years from a small basic programme on satellitetechnology which is virtually at an end pending a decision on the black arrow programme (see paragraph 9) and we are currently spending about 1.0 million per annum on general space technology.     Most of this isintramural expenditure.    We also participate in the programmes of the interim Communications Satellite Committee (iCSC) which is an internationalconsortium set up in 1964 with the object of developing a global systemof satellite communications.   Our share (7*6 per cent) is estimated to cost  1.25 million per year up to 1970 when the present interim organisation will be replaced.     In addition the Post Office, as part of its normal commercial investment in communications, is extending our satellite earthstation at Goonhilly Down in Cornwall at an expected cost of  2.4 million.In the launcher field, which is incidental to the preceding interests,we participate in the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO)whose programme includes the construction of a demonstration satellite( 11.0 million in 1966-67 dropping to  1.4 million in 1971-72) and,pending Ministerial decisions, we have holding contracts on BLACK AP?QW,which if the full programmes were agreed (see Section C) would cost 3.55 million in 1966-67 rising to  5.3 million in 1971-72.8.     In 1966-67, 30 per cent of our space programmes (excluding BLACK ARROW)comprises scientific space research, 7 per cent relates to satellite communications, 58 per cent to launcher development and 5 per cent togeneral satellite technology.   In 1971-72, these percentages would be67 per cent, 11 per cent, 13 per cent and 9 per cent respectively (Table l).Further programmes which are described in sections C-E below,  and whichare under consideration in the light of our interests will, if agreed,obviously affect the balance of these programmes and their effort willbe discussed later (see paragraph 27).
Co   BLACK ARROW and the National Technological Space programme .   This programme covers -(i)   The further development and construction of a small satellitelauncher (BLACK ARROW) designed (a) so that satellite components and sub-assemblies can be proved in actual space conditions and10.     Both parts have been planned as a single integrated and self-containedproject.   The experimental components in the satellites launched byBLACK ARROW would enable us to develop an independent capability in satellitedesign, to demonstrate to prospective customers the viability of ourcomponents in space.     The programme does not have an operational satellite,for communications or other purposes, as its end product.    The total cost,including telemetry and tracking facilities, over the next eight years(1967-75) is estimated at  41.4 million (Table 3).11.     Savings could be obtained by either -(a)   reducing the number of satellite launchings from five to threein the development phase and from three to one per year in the utilisation phase as well as, at some technical risk, the &apos;ground test programme.     This would afford a total saving of 15 million; or(b)     discontinuing the development of the launcher and buyingforeign launchers for either the full or reduced utilisationphase.   If foreign launchers a.re purchased there would be certain technological disadvantages.   Moreover the explorationof new ideas in space technolog2r would be dependent on the availability of such launchers and involve disclosure of our intentions to the suppliers of the launchers.     This would yield a net total saving over the eight years of between 7 and  18 million depending on the type and number oflaunchers bought, but the element of expenditure in foreign exchange would be increased by between  4.5 million and 12 million. (Table 3).(ii)(b) so that direct practical experience can be obtained of theproblems of injecting satellites into prescribed orbits and of controlling them there and continued research into basic technology of satellites, andtheir development and manufacture.
12.   Another    option    would   be   to   discontinue   the   present programme completely, and continue with basic satellite technology only atan expected cost of  1.5 million a year.   This would mean we should have noindependent means of proving components or sub-systems in space, and the exploration of new ideas such as low thrust systems would not be possible.The level of expertise at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) would diminish and it would be difficult to keep a high-quality team in being.It would also preclude us from playing a useful part in the CETS programme(see Section D below).   The technical value of such a limited programme would not justify the expenditure involved.     The Department of education and Science points out that if, as a result of restrictions in the space technology programmes, the expertise and technical facilities available   inthe United Kingdom were to decline, then our space scientists would increasinglyhave to rely on advice and technical support from abroad.D.     The proposed programmes of the European Conference on Satellite13.   The present CETS plan, which has still to be approved by other member governments (see paragraph 24)5 has recently been revised to take account ofthe changed ELDO programme and consists of three stages:   (i) the exploitingof any available ELDO firings to carry ad hoc communication and satellitetechnological payloads;    (ii) the development of experimental communicationssatellites to serve as test vehicles for possible future technical develop- 1ments, the latter being combined with certain laboratory programmes for communication and satellite technology;   and (iii) design studies andexperiistsatal development of future applications for satellites, such astelevision broadcasting and navigational and meteorological purposes.   this last stage would begin with economic and feasibility studies and associatedexperimental work (ending in mid-1971) to determine the extent to which it isworth proceeding with further development.   The object of the whole programme is the co-operative development of a European capability over a wide range of communications satellite uses, including the possibility of a Europeancontribution of equipment to the global system, and to meet possible futureEuropean requirements for regional satellite systems, particularly for television broadcasting but also for navigation and meteorology.    (The PostOffice consider that satellites are unlikely to prove economic for tele-communications within Europe, even if no account is taken of launcher andsatellite development costs.)   As currently planned, however, the second phase will be concerned only with the development of communications satellitetechnology.   The cost of the programmes to mid-1971 (end of the preparatory work for the third stage) is estimated at  34 million, of which the UnitedKingdom share would be  8.5 million (25 per cent).   If we agreed to-5-CONFSDENTBAL
participate only in the second stage and the preparatory work for the third stage and as would be prudent, add a further 25 per cent contingency to thepresent estimated cost of the development work on the second stage, the costto the United Kingdom would be about  9.7 million up to 1971-72 (Table 3).In its revised form the plan offers a more acceptable basis for participationas well as an end use for the ELDO launcher development to which we are nowcommitted.   However, the utilisation of these new applications of satelliteswould need to be agreed with the European and international bodies concernedsuch as the World Meteorological Organisation and the International Tele-communication Union.   This need not, however, delay the economic andfeasibility studies with which the third stage is to begin.14*   The second and third stages of the plan are designed to form a continuingprogramme, subject to the satisfactory outcome of the studies and experimental work which open the third stage.   Although it would be possible to share onlyin the work on the second stage, which would develop our communicationssatellite technology at a cost of about  8 million, there would be little pointin our doing so if it were thon our intention to withdraw.     It would   bothe third stage at which we should be enabled to play a part in the otheruses of satellites if we so desired.   There would, however, be no commitment to the third stage beyond 197&quot;! and the results of the economic and feasibilitystudies could provide a break-point at which we could withdraw if they suggested that it would be financially or technologically not in our interests to continue.15.   It should be stressed that the CETS programme has been based on theassumption that there would be supporting national programmes in member countries.   Thus although, subject to the points made in paragraph 23, wecould carry out the national programme and not participate at all in the CETSprogramme, we could not play our part in the CETS programme without at least some supporting national space programme - though it would not be essential for this to be on the scale of the full BLACK ARROW programme.   Beforediscussing the minimal size of this supporting national programme(paragraphs 20 and 21) it will be useful to compare the objectives of the two.16.   The national space programme is a research programme designed to achieve a national space technological capability, using national launchers, whichwill give us the competence for a wide range of national or internationalactivities in a field in which the potentialities nay be of considerable importance to us but are still unknown.   The CETS programme arises from apolitical desire amongst members of CETS to develop a communications satellite
capability independently of the United States.   Its avowed objective is toimprove European space technology and in particular to enable Europe toprovide equipment for use in the global system.   But some countries may wellsee it as leading to the establishment of a separate European sub-systemeither for point-to-point communications, which would in our view bedoubtfully practicable on commercial and political grounds, or for televisionrelay or other applications, which may prove of much greater importance.   Thetwo programmes would not duplicate each other technically, although there might be some slight overlapping.E.     Participation in an Advanced Space Project17.   On Presidential initiative the United States Government has proposedcollaboration with Europe in developing a space-craft for any form of advanced scientific mission - a probe to Jupiter seemed to be the mostpromising - although the final choice would lie with European scientists.If it were agreed to participate Europe would be responsible for the management and control of the project: the United States would provide the launeher, launchiigand use of the deep space tracking network.   The total cost to the UnitedKingdom of a project of the kind envisaged, which would start in 1968, isat present estimated to be  9.0 million ( 6.0 million up to 1971 with thefurther  2.5 million, falling mostly in 1972) though the United States Y/ould be willing, if necessary, to defer funding until 1972.   This expenditure(Table 3D) would be in addition to our present ESRO contribution (vide Table 1).18.   The Science Research Council, although aocepting that there is a highscientific interest in the project, have stated that such expenditure couldnot be justified on scientific grounds alone.   Nor could they find the funds for it from the resources likely to be at their disposal.   Indeed, if extramoney were available, they would prefer to use it to support other scientificprojects which have already been deferred.19.   It has been strongly emphasised by the United States National Aeronauticand Space Administration (NASA) that the mounting of such a mission will neces-sitate many advanced technological developments in which all participantswill share, and these in turn will lead to indirect technical benefits(&quot;spin-off&quot;), which, though not directly quantifiable, will lead to a greatstimulation of the electronic and associated industries.   If we decided toparticipate, and each country received contracts in accordance with its contribution, we could expect that about 80 to 90 per cent of our expenditure would be on contracts with United Kingdom industry, although this has not beenour experience in ESRO so far.   Nevertheless we consider that the BLACK ARROWand CETS programmes are of greater technological importance to us.   Many ofour European partners have also expressed doubt about the usefulness of the project and some have clearly stated that they would not be able to providefunds for it.-7-
P.     Considerations for participation in additional space programmes20.   In deciding which of the courses open to us offers us the &quot;best advantage in relation to the expenditure involved we must also consider the effect achosen course would have on the &quot;balance of our space programme as a whole andits relation to oilier technological fields.   In theory the alternatives areas follows:--8-

Since the courses involving the use of foreign launchers do not afford very great, savings in comparison with the reduced BLACK AERO?/end national technological programme and, as pointed out in the table in paragraph 20 and paragraph 11 (b), they also have a number of technical disadvantages, we do not consider these alternatives are worth pursuing.     Nor do we believe that in the present financial stringency we are justified in recommending the continuation of thefull BLACK ARROW programme, especially as such a programme on a reduced scale should secure us a national satellite capability, albeit at sometechnical risk.     On the assumption that the CETS programme will beundertaken by our European partners there are thus three practicalcourses left open to the United Kingdom -(a) to participate in CETS supported by the reduced BLACK ARROW and national technological space programme;   or(b) to undertake the reduced BLACK ARROW and national technologicalspace programme without participation in CETS;   or(c) to opt out of any of the alternative programmes shown inparagraph 20 and to confine our space activities to those shown in Table 1, which represent our existing commitments.The cost of the first two of the above courses oompared with&quot;our expenditure on agreed space activities are -  million
If we follow course (a) above, no further qualified staff would berequired intramurally but about 65, rising to 110, wauld be employedextramurally for the development of satellites.   These increases would be offset by the numbers expected to become redundant as development work onlaunchers for ELDO and the BLACK ARROW programme is finished.   Forcourse (b), about 35 to 60 extramural staff are required for satellite work,and these again would offset by redundancies in the launcher field.   if however we pursued course (c) above and opted out of the alternativeprogrammes shorn in paragraph 20, work on the BLACK ARROW and national spaceprogramme, which is in progress under holding contracts (paragraph 7)*would cease and about 200 qualified scientists and engineers now employed,of whom 85 are at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, would become redundant.-11-
G-.    Economic and Industrial Considerations22.    (i)   The only certain market for communication satellites which can now he foreseen is in the later stages of the global communications system.In the longer run there may be a number of other possible uses for satellites,e.g. direct radio and television broadcasting, navigation, etc.), but on existing information this would not provide a direct economic justification for the expenditure now proposed.     In short, even if the chosen courseresulted in our being able to develop and manufacture satellites the expen-diture involved would not be justified by any likelihood of an immediateeconomic return.(ii) The case for going ahead with either course (a) or (b) thus rests onunquajitifiable factors.     Either course would help our aerospace and elec-tronics industry as a whole in that the experience which they would gain by working on more comprehensive space programmes would stimulate them to under-take other developments and pursue a number of technologies to the limit.Participation in such programmes might also stimulate those parts of theindustries engaged on satellite technology to compete more effectively withthe best European firms to obtain international contracts (e.g. for ESRO).(iii) But those who oppose additional expenditure on space point out that theaerospace and electronic sectors of United Kingdom industry already receivesubstantial Government contracts in such fields as advanced computers and aircraft.     Additional expenditure on space programmes, even if it did conferbenefits on a particular section or sections of the aerospace and electronicindustry could not be justified by its effect on improving the efficiency ofUnited Kingdom industry as a whole.     As to the possible indirect benefits to industry from programmes of this kind (&quot;spin off&quot;) better results in the longer term could in theory be achieved by direct expenditure on research anddevelopment in the industries concerned.(iv) On the other hand space is a field which is developing very rapidly andwhich may well present us with benefits and opportunities which will only beapparent in the long term.     It is also a field to which the leading european nations are devoting appreciable resources and to which other major industrial countries do not think they can afford to ignore.     TiJhat needs to be decided therefore is whether in the light of our economic situation,we can afford to go ahead in either of the limited ways proposed, in thehopes of future unquantdfiable benefits, or whether we must opt out of these programmes altogether.23.    Consideration has been given to the best method of achieving industrialresults.,     Eor this purpose officials have twice met the National IndustrialSpace Committee (NISC) who are industry&apos;s chajinel for communications withthe Government on space matters, although they do not speak for the aero-space and electronic industries as a whole.     The considered view of theNISC is that the primary objective in the development of United KingdomCONFIDENTIAL-12-
space technology is participation in the CETS programme or a similarEuropean programme which would exploit the ELDO-PAS launcher.      They alsoassest that a parallel national programme is essential to participation ina CETS type programme.     The question is not therefore of relativepriorities between a national programme and a CETS programme but rather to   determine the minimum level of the former to make participation inCETS worthwhile.     The NISC are convinced that the national programme must make provision for launching experimental satellites with a national launcher.They regard the reduced BLACK ARROW programme as the minimum fulfilment ofthis requirement which yet represents a significant advance.     They regard a basio satellite technology programme without orbital tests under nationalcontrol as providing an inadequate technical return for the expenditure involved.     The logical conclusion, which the NISC accept, is that we should undertake the reduced BLACK ARROW programme and participation, in   CETS(course (a) in paragraph 21).    NISC takes the view that   if it were possibleto devote more money to the national programme and increase the frequency of launchings the technological cost effectiveness would be greatly onhanoed.H.    Political Interests24.   No European Government has yet declared its attitude to the CETSprogramme, &quot;but now that ELDO&apos;s future has been decided, decisions onparticipation will very shortly be required (22nd November 1966).Germany and the smaller European countries are likely, on balance, to favour a co-operative venture.    France, although still undecided aboutthe CETS programme, is now likely to view this more favourably than goingit alone or co-operating on a narrower basis with Germany and possibly the United Kingdom,     In whatever form, European development of satellitetechnology will certainly go forward and our power to influence eventswill depend on our participation.     Our political interests lie in promoting co-operation on the broadest practicable basis.25.   Although we have no formal connitment to take part in the CETSprogramme we decided in July to continue our contributions to ELDO whosebasic purpose is to construct a launcher which could be used for communications satellites.     At the same time we agreed to take part in discussions leading to the co-ordination of the space objectives and activities now pursued independently through ELDO, ESRO and CETS.Against this background, a refusal by the United Kingdom to take part inCETS would risk being construed as a reversal of policy which, coming on top of the ELDO episode, would further harm our prospects of collaboration inother and perhaps more immediately important technological fields, civil and-13-
military.     Given the relatively modest size of our contribution to CETS( 0.6 million in 1967-68, rising to  2.9 million in 1970-71) an attemptto justify our non-participation on grounds of financial stringency might seem spurious to our partners;   or, if believed, might lead them to drawunfortunate inferences about our economic situation.     These political considerations should be carefully weighed against the arguments forconcentrating exclusively upon a national programme or abandoning satellitetechnology altogether.I.     Effect of additional programmes on the balance of our civil spaceprogramme26.   Our contribution to ELDO, if we do not commit ourselves to any furtherprogrammes before 1971-72, would fall from  11.0 million in 1966-67 to 1.4 million in 1971-72, and our total expenditure on approved spaceprogrammes other than for defence purposes from  18.8 million per annum to 10.9 million per annum.     The cost of the full additional programmes (black arrow, CETS but excluding Jupiter probe) outlined in this paper rises from 3.55 million in 1966-67 (to most of whioh, in respect of BLACK ARROW, we arealready committed) to  8.2 million in 1971-72.     Thus, if we took part in allthese additional programmes, our total expenditure on space in 1971-72( 19.1 million) would be about 2 per cent higher than now though it would presumably represent a lower proportion of our gross national product.     Withregard to the consideration in the public Expenditure Committee of public expenditure as a whole, the full BLACK ARROW programme is in the basic programme for the Ministry of Aviation;   if we undertake the CETS and a reduced BLACK ARROW programme there would be a reduction in cost of 0.5 million in 19&amp;7-68;   the small additional total cost over five years( 1,7 million) would have to be met out of whatever allowance for additionalprogrammes Ministers decided to make in subsequent years,27.   Since we cannot forecast the total expenditure on civil research anddevelopment in the public sector in 1972, the proportion likely to be devotedto space in that year cannot be calculated.     If we undertake the extraprogrammes shown under course (a) in paragraph 21 (CETS plus reduced black arrow), however, the percentage of the total for space in 1972 ( 16,9 million)devoted to scientific space research, satellite communications, launcherteohnology and general space technology would be 42.6, 35.6, 14.2 and7.6 per cent respectively.    We would then presumably have a better balanceof expenditure between basic and applied research than if we did not engage in the additional programmes (see paragraph 8).     Furthermore our contributionto international organisations would drop from the present 86 per cent to57 per cent.
CONCLUSIONS &quot; 21228.   On the assunption that there will be a CETS programme (seeparagraph 2k-) the effective choice before us, having regard to the considerations set out in paragraph 21 and the views of industry givenin paragraph 23, appears to be either -(i)   to participate in the CETS programme with an associated reducedBLACK ARROW national space   technological programme;   or(ii)   to opt out of further additional programmes in space.In addition   Ministers have to decide -(iii)   whether to participate in a joint United States-European scientificprogramme such as the Jupiter probe (paragraphs 17-19).This third is the last in our order of priority and in present economic circumstances we do not recommend participation.     As to (i) and (ii)Departments are not in agreement.    We are committed to participation inthe programmes of ELDO and ESRO, but in relation to the size and natureof our shares in these programmes the technological return to the UnitedKingdom will be comparatively small.     There will be no   immediateeconomic case nor a justification in terms of indirect &quot;spin-off&quot; fordevoting further resources to space technology, but additional expenditureon the scale proposed may nevertheless be desirable not only as a rein-forcement to our international commitments but also because of the scientificchallenge which space technology affords.   Such a challenge would belilely to have a fructifying influence, yielding the extra technologicalbenefit which might have a decisive effect on the economic viability of our industries concerned with space technology and satellite communications.Despite the magnitude and technical advancement of the United Statesspace effort, important developments could spring from a modest national programme.     On these grounds the Ministries of Aviation and Technologysupport the reduced BLACK ARROW programme and participation in CETS (i))above).     On political grounds the Foreign Office also favour participation in the CETS programme.     The Treasury and Department of Economic Affairsconsider that the size of the minimum viable programme as assessed in thisreport, is larger than can be justified in present circumstances, given theneed to limit the growth of public expenditure and the uncertainty of thebenefits from this programme, would represent a misuse of scarce national resources.29;   If the CETS programme does not materialise the Ministry of Aviation and ministry of Technology would wish to continue with the reduced BLACK ARROWand national technological space programme, but recognise that it might haveto be re-examined in relation to the new situation in Europe.-15-
