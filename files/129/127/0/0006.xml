November 1966 __C (66) 147 Copy No.     6 ?4th November, 1966CABINETTELEVISING PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGSMemorandum by Lord President of the Council andthe Lord Privy SealNow that the Select Committee on Broadcasting, etc., of proceedings in the House of Commons has reported,* it is necessaryfor us to consider what the attitude of the Government spokesmenshould be in the debate for which the previous Lord President agreedto give time. It is hoped to arrange this debate later this month.It will also be necessary at a later date for the Lord Privy Seal in the lords to indicate the Governments view of the proposal to televisethat House, which has already decided in principle that it desiresits proceedings to be publicly televised for an experimental period.2. When the matter was last considered by the Cabinet(CC (65) 31st Conclusions, Minute 5), as a result of a debate initiated by Mr. Iremonger, there was some support for the view that changesin the relationship between Parliament and public opinion might provide stronger justification than had formerly existed for consentingto some degree of broadcasting of Parliamentary proceedings, but itwas agreed that the Government spokesmen in the debate should confine themselves to indicating that the Government would not take any initiative in this matter, but that they would be prepared to pursue it if this was clearly the general wish of Parliament. Thiswas the line adopted by the previous Lord President in the debate on 28th May, 1965.3. The Select Committee has now come out in support ofarrangements for televising proceedings. The detailed examinationconducted by the Select Committee shows that there are no technical reasons why the televising of proceedings should not proceed and thenecessary apparatus would not be obtrusive or inconvenienceMembers. In particular, no difficulty is envisaged about theenhanced level of lighting which will be required. The SelectCommittee&apos;s view on televising proceedings is, I think, to be welcomed, although a number of their long-term recommendations* Any Minister who does not have a copy of their First Report may obtainone from the Privy Council Office.CONFIDENTIAL7348 a
will require careful consideration. It is unnecessary at this stage toexamine the merits of these recommendations but it is perhaps worthpointing out now that the concept of a House of CommonsBroadcasting Unit gives rise to difficulties, since such a Unit might find themselves with little to do during the recesses and it would beuneconomic in the use of staff (if it were left to the broadcasting authorities to provide expert staff, such staff could, during recesses,be rotated to other tasks); any suggestion that a full record ofParliamentary proceedings should be broadcast, or even preservedseems unjustifiable (although there is much to be said for arranging for a permanent sound record to be retained for the archives);and the view of the Select Committee that the televising of proceedings would not affect the nature of debates is unlikely to prove realistic.4. It is not, however, necessary to reach decisions on thelong-term proposals at this stage. Before such decisions are reached,the Select Committee recommended that there should be a two-monthclosed-circuit experiment in the period between the Christmas andEaster adjournments in 1967. (This period was chosen becauseoutside broadcast activities become more intense from Marchonwards each year and the apparatus will no longer be available.)A closed-circuit experiment will, however, not be of great value in deciding whether the proceedings of the House should be televised only a very small proportion of proceedings will be used for thefinal edited programme. The essential thing is for the House to havean opportunity to see the edited programmes. Further, in consideringthe proposal for an experiment, there are three factors which shouldbe borne in mind:(a) Since the experiment would be costly to both Houses andalso to the broadcasting authorities because it wouldoccupy valuable staff and apparatus, it is essential that itsduration should be limited to.the minimum necessary to gain full benefits from the experiments; further, so faras possible, it should cover all aspects of the proceedingsof the House which are likely in the event to be comprisedwithin programmes prepared by the broadcasting authorities. Considerable doubt exists whether it isnecessary to have a closed-circuit simultaneous coverage ofall the proceedings on the floor of the House of Commonsfor as long as eight weeks. Moreover it seems that, asfar as the experiment in the House of Commons isconcerned, it should include not only proceedings on the floor but also, as is proposed by the Report of the SelectCommittee, proceedings upstairs. (I should point outthat the Opposition may oppose the extension of the experiment upstairs.) In addition to televisingproceedings in a Standing Committee, it should bepossible during the period of the experiment to arrangefor the televising of the proceedings of a SelectCommittee. It is the practice of Select Committees (apart
CONFIDENTIAL 3- *from the Select Committee on Private Bills) to sit in private, but it is open to them, if they so wish, to sit in public. The proceedings of a Select Committee, such asthe Select Committee on Nationalised Industries, while itis taking evidence would undoubtedly make excellentviewing and it would be valuable for the purposes of the experiment (particularly in the editing of programmes) ifsuch proceedings could also be televised.(b) Any experiment which excluded simultaneous televising ofthe proceedings of the House of Lords would be unrealistic. The House of Lords has gone one stepfurther than the Commons as it decided in principle onthe 15th June, 1966, on a vote (56-31) that it &quot; would welcome the televising of some of its proceedings foran experimental period&quot;. Following this decision a select Committee was set up on 21st July to &quot; consider how the Resolution of the 15th June last . . . can best be carried into effect&quot;. This Committee is currentlyvigorously at work and is expected to issue an interimreport some time after the Commons debate on television and before Christmas. It is understood that this report will recommend to the House that it should co-operate with the Commons in a joint experiment and that the resultant programme should be shown on a closed circuit.When the interim report is debated, the Lord Privy Sealwill have to indicate the Government^ attitude. It seemsto us that the experiment in televising proceedings shouldbe an integrated one involving at some stage at leastsimultaneous recordings of the proceedings in bothHouses. Any other experiment would be totallyunrealistic and would therefore be of much less value tothe Members of both Houses when attempting to judge the experiment. It is expected both that the Lords&apos;Select Committee will recommend this joint experimentand that the House itself will endorse the irrecommendation to this effect.(c) The closed circuit simultaneous transmission is designed togive Members an idea of the problem involved. but what really interests them is not this but the finalprogramme.5. We have, therefore, explored with the broadcasting authorities the various possibilities which are open to the House toset in motion an experiment taking into account the factors set outin the preceding paragraphs. The broadcasting authorities are verywilling to mount an experiment on the lines proposed they agreethat the most important part of any experiment must involve the simultaneous recording of proceedings in both Houses but they arein some difficulty since the duplicating of coverage which an integrated experiment makes necessary raises special problemsbecause of the demands which it would make on their limited resources of specialist editorial, production and engineering staff andCONFIDENTIAL7348 a 2
on scarce equipment. They are understandably hesitant to agreeto any experiment which could only be undertaken at the risk of producing experimental results below the standard which they would hope to be able to offer in the long run. Both broadcasting authorities have agreed, however, that an experiment might be conducted provided it is of a limited duration and, as part of the experiment, it is accepted that it will be necessary to record theproceedings on one day and present the edited version on thefollowing day.6. The broadcasting authorities have, therefore, suggested, in substitution for the proposals in the Report of the Select Committeea five-week experiment on the following lines:Weeks 1 to 4. During this period the experiment wouldinvolve the House of Commons alone on the lines recommended in the Report of the Select Committee. The two broadcasting authorities would operate during alternate weeks during thisperiod producing not only closed-circuit transmissions but alsospecimen edited programmes. It would be necessary on days of Committee coverage to suspend coverage of the mainproceedings on the floor of the House. (If during the periodof the experiment morning sittings were to be held, there isa possibility that these might clash with the demands ofCommittee coverage.)Week 5. During this week both Houses would be covered.If the House of Lords were to sit from Monday to Thursdayconcurrently with the House of Commons, the days ofsimultaneous recording of both Houses would be Tuesday andWednesday. On Tuesday one of the broadcasting organisationswould direct the cameras in both Houses and record theproceedings of both; on Wednesday the same organisation would edit Tuesday&apos;s recording for inclusion in a single reportfor reproduction over closed-circuit at viewing times convenient to Members of both Houses on Wednesday. The otherbroadcasting authority would record Wednesday^ proceedings in both Houses for similar treatment on Thursday. On theMonday and the Thursday of this week the opportunity wouldbe taken for proceedings in the House of Lords to be shownalone over closed-circuit television and recorded. These tapesmight then be made into edited versions of the proceedings ofthe House of Lords alone by one or both of the broadcasting organisations for showing at some convenient time the following week, say on the next Tuesday.Radio. If the above proposals are accepted, the BBC wishalso to record the proceedings of both Houses for the purposeof providing specimen edited programmes on radio as well astelevision which could be played back at suitable times to suitthe convenience of Members of both Houses.7. These revised proposals by the broadcasting authoritiesseem to us to be acceptable and we suggest that both Houses shouldbe recommended to accept them.  The five-week experiment
proposed would take place between the Christmas and EasterAdjournments in 1967 and should provide the Government and parliament with sufficient information to decide whether the televisingof proceedings of both Houses should become a permanent feature.In view of the amount of effort involved and the cost, we do notthink that we should enter upon the experiment unless it is our intention, if the experiment is a success, of making permanent arrangements for televising both Houses. If it were to be decidedthat proceedings should be televised, the broadcasting authoritiesadvise us that it may take them about a year to assemble the staff and apparatus to be able to do this. Nevertheless the televisingof proceedings of Parliament could become a permanent featuresome time in the 1967-68 session.8. The broadcasting authorities were asked for a revised,&apos;estimate of cost of the experiment based on the view expressed inthe Report of the Select Committee that only the additional cost ofthe experiment should be borne by the House authorities. Broadlywhat is involved is a Supplementary Estimate for  150,000 whichwould be borne on the House of Commons Vote (Civil Estimates,Class I, Vote 2) and a Supplementary Estimate for  18,000 whichwould be borne on the House of Lords Vote (Civil Estimates, Class 1,Vote 1). It is, of course, impossible at this stage to make any estimateof the cost of any permanent arrangements which would be madesince this would depend on the nature of those arrangements.9. The supervision of the experiment in the Commons will,if the recommendation of the Select Committee is accepted, be conducted under the aegis of a new Sub-Committee of the SelectCommittee on House of Commons (Services). This seems a sensiblesuggestion since this Select Committee will be closely concerned with many aspects of the experiment for example, with the provisionof facilities and accommodation and it is a means by which on theone hand the House can express its views through its own machinery and on the other the Lord President can, as Chairman, keep closely in touch with the arrangements for the experiment. There is noreason to believe that the proposal will be unacceptable to theServices Committee. In the case of the Lords this experiment willbe carried out under the supervision of the Television and administration Committees acting jointly.10. We invite the agreement of our colleagues to the proposals in this Paper, and in particular for an integrated experiment involvingboth Houses of Parliament on the lines suggested in paragraph above.R.
