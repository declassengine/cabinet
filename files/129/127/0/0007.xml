I announced last March that the United Kingdom would switchto a decimal currency in February 1971, on the basis of the  -centsystem.    Arrangements are being made to set up a Decimal CurrencyBoard to direct the changeover.    I hope before long to be asking theCabinet to approve a draft White Paper setting out the governments proposals in detail.    Early decisions are, however, required pnthe new coinage.2.       The Ministerial Committee on Decimal Currency have considered recommendations by officials, based on therecommendations of the Halsbury Committee, for the new coinage.The relevant considerations and arguments are set out in a note bythe Chairman of the Official Committee on Decimal Currency, acopy of which is attached to this memorandum.    The ministerial committee reached general agreement on the following conclusions,which I now invite the Cabinet to endorse:(i) The new minor unit - l/100th part of a   - should becalled a penny, not a cent.    To minimise confusionduring the transitional period, the unit will have tobe described during that period as the &quot;new penny&quot;.The Committee thought that, while this could causesome confusion during the transition, that wouldnot be unmanageable, and there was a general feeling that the public would probably want to keepthe penny in our currency.(ii) The sequence of coin denominations should be \, 1,2, 5, 10 and 50 new pence.    This will mean the disappearance of the equivalent of the 6d coin, withnothing between the 2 new penny piece (4. 8d) andthe 5 new penny piece (is. ); and it will mean nocoin between the 10 new penny piece (2s. ) and the50 new penny piece (10s. ).    The lack of the 6d coinwill cause some inconvenience, but a      new pennypiece would have no logical place in the system.The gap between 10 new pence and 50 new pence willbe little wider than the gap between 2/6 and 10/-.If later on the need for some intermediate coin was felt, it would be possible to introduce a 20 or 25new penny coin.-1-I DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 148 COPY NO. _7th November, 1966CABINETDECIMAL CURRENCY;  COINAGEMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer
(iii)        The \, 1 and 2 new penny coins should be of bronze,in weight/value relationship, ranging from a jdslightly bigger than the old silver 3d piece to a2d coin about the size of a present halfpenny.(iv)        The 5 new penny and 10 new penny coins should becupro-nickel coins of the same size as their present day equivalents, the 1/- and 2/- pieces.(v)       A 50 new penny coin should be provided instead of thepresent 10/- note.    Some of us would like to see asilver coin, but that would probably be tooexpensive.    There are to be further studies on this,but I fear that we may have to stick to cupro-nickel.The shape and size of the new coin are for furtherconsideration: the important consideration is thatit should be readily distinguishable from the other&quot;white&quot; coins.(vi)        The present halfpenny should be withdrawn beforedecimalisation, and should not be replaced in thedecimal system.    To have a new quarter pennywould add substantially to the difficulty and cost ofthe changeover.    Its absence will be felt mainly inthe food trades, where halfpennies feature in theprices of certain goods like bread and milk, but alsoin the confectionery, tobacco and petrol trades.There is some danger that dropping the halfpennywill lead to price increases, but the effect on the retail price index will be small, particularly if   1increases in some cases are balanced by decreasesin other cases.    On balance we are satisfied thatthe advantages of dropping the halfpenny outweigh the disadvantages.3.      The Royal Mint have announced that there will be a competition for designs for the new coinage.    I attach importance to havingsimple and uncluttered designs, in which the numerical indicatorsof value feature prominently.    In choosing designs we shall have thebenefit of the views of the Royal Mint Advisory Committee.Ij. j. c .Treasury Chambers, S. W.l.7th November, 1966.2-COMF1DENT5AL
DECIMAL CURRENCY:    COINAGENote by the Chairman of the Official Committee1.     The Official Committee have considered the HalsburyWrecommendationa for the coins to &quot;be introduced under a   - centsystem of decimal currency.The Halsbury proposals.     The Halsbury Report proposed six coins as follows:Bronze coinsdenomination edge diameter weight (grains)i cent (l.2d) plain 0.675&quot; 27.5(slightly bigger than the silver 3d piece)1 cent (2.^d) plain 0.800&quot; 55(slightly bigger than the farthing)2 cent (U.8d) plain 1.020&quot; 110(slightly bigger than the halfpenny)Cupro-nickel coins5 cent (Is) milled 0.929&quot; 87.27(shilling size and weight)10 cent (2s) milled 1.122&quot; 17U.55(florin size and weight)20 cent (l*s) milled l.h.20&quot; 3U9.09(approaching crown size and weight)3.     The Report points out that a 50 cent (10s) coin might bedesirable later, instead of a banknote.
Nomenclature . g the      The Halsbury Committee referred to the minor unit for convenience as &quot;cent throughout their Report.   They were notimplying that it should in fpet be given that name.    &apos;Cent&apos; is an obvious name for the hundredth part of the rrnjor unit an&apos;J itsdistinctiveness (assuming people used it) would help reduceconfusion during the changeover.   On the other hand there have beenindications in the Press and in letters to the Treasury that itwould be too transatlantic in flavour for many people.   A morerational objection is that if &quot;iienny&apos; is not. used for the minor unitit might well be popularly used for the   cent (close tc it in value) with the consequent danger of this j cent becoming the unitmost commonly used in ordinary speech and everyday moneytransactions, thus infringing the decimal principle.5.     The alternative name to &quot;cent is therefore &quot;penny&apos;, a namewith a long history and one which it would be a pity tc lose.    Inthe transition the minor unit would have to be differentiated fromthe present penny, which will circulate alongside it during the transitional period.   This points to the name  &apos;new penny&apos; - more vigorous than &quot;decimal penny&quot; - in the expectation that &apos;new&quot;will in due course be dropped.6.     Opinion on the Official Committee, as on the Halsbury Committee,is divided.   The majority view favours &quot;new penny&quot;.   Both names are used in the rest of this paper.Weight/value relationship7.     In both the bronze and cupro-nickel Halsbury coinage tiersthere is a weight/value relationship, e.g. the 2 cent (new penny)weighs twice as much as the 1 cent (new penny) arid the 20 four times as much as the 5.   The present  . s. d. cupro-nickel coins(6d., Is., 2s., and 2s. 6d.) are in weight/value relationship butthe bronze coins are not.   The value of a mixed lot of coins inweight/value relationship can be checked by weighing in bulk andthis feature is a great help to banks, retailers, transport undertakings and the Post Office.   It is on the strong recommendation
of such interests that the Halsbury Committee decided to retainweight/value relationship for the cupro-nickel coins and to extendit to the bronze coins.   This decision, which in the view of theOfficial Committee was right, limits the choice of coin sizes.   Itled Halsbury to recommend a 20 cent (new penny) coin which isalmost certainly too large and heavy to be useful.Sequence of denominations8.     The values proposed by Halsbury were based on two considerations:    that coins and notes should be in true decimalprogression and that the most economic and manageable series isthat which allows one to pay any given amount, or give change toany given amount, with the smallest number of coins.   This leads tothe sequence       1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50,  1.9.     In the view of the Official Committee the Halsbury sequence is,the right one, though three questions need to be answered:(i)   Would a 2? cent (new penny) coin, which could be identical in value, weight and size with the popularsixpence, be preferable to a 2?(ii)   Is it really necessary to have a coin between 10 (2s) and50 (10s) cents (new pence)?(iii)   Would a 50 (10s) cent (new penny) coin be preferable to a50 banknote?The 2 versus the 2 10.   The argument for the sixpenny sized 2? cent (new penny) coin isthat it retains a familiar and popular coin, might thus ease the transition, and would spare the expense of altering 6d. slotmachines.   But a value incorporating a      i.e. in the middle of the sequence, is not in decimal progression, and experiments commissionedby Halsbury showed that people found change-giving and reckoningmore difficult with such a fractional coin.   The 2? cent coin inSouth Africa (previously the popular 3d. bit) became unpopularafter decimalisation and is being replaced by a 2 cent coin.   Afurther argument against the 2  is that, when eventually the   cent(new penny) itself becomes obsolete, it would remain as a distinctblemish on the system.
11.   The Official Committee &quot;believe that the Halsbury decision infavour of a 2 cent (new penny) piece was the right one.A 20 cent (new -penny) piece12.   There is no coin in the Ub/^b range in general circulation now and the need for a decimal coin is thun open to doubt, a doubtstrengthened by the considerable difficulty of fin-ling h suitablesize for it.   The Halsbury Committee coulo find ir* solution otherthan to recommend a very large coin in weight/value relationship tothe 5 and 10 coins.   On the other hand we now have the half-crown(which at 12^ cents (new pence) is unacceptable in a decimalsystem) and, when it goes, a Us. or 5s. coin of convenient size(which the crown is not) might be useful.   Opinion on the official committee is not unanimous, but the majority view is that a 20 coinshould not be provided initially, when it would add to the already considerable problems facing the Mint and the banks.   A decision not to introduce such a coin at the start of decimalisation doesnot, of course, rule out its introduction later when the need r.aybe clearer.   It would also then be for consideration whether a 25(5s) coin, representing the familiar concept of a quarter of the major unit, might be a more useful coin than a 20 (Us) coin, inspite of the departure it represents from the logical decimalsequence of denominations.The 50 coin versus the 50 banknote13.   The argument for a 50 cent (new penny) coin is primarily aneconomic one.   The production, circulation and eventual withdrawal and destruction of notes is an increasingly costly business and thelower the denomination of note issued the more costly it is in proportion to its value.   The current cost of 10s. note production is about  700,000 a year.   As much as 20% of resources at the Bank ofEngland Printing Works - at present fully extended - are devoted to10s. notes, which represent only h% by value of total notecirculation.   If these resources were devoted to notes of higherdenomination substantial economies would result.   This wouldh
postpone for some time the need to extend the Works with aconsiderable saving of capital expenditure.Ik,   Even at today&apos;s prices find average 10k. note life (5 months)it would cost ks, Vd. to maintain a 50 note in circulation for50 years - a calculation which doe a not take account of the highand rising costs, not involved with coins, of transporting to andfrom the Bank each year, under maximum security, some 500 millionpieces of paper.   Against this a 50 coin in a base metal - with alife of at least 50 years - might cost roughly 5d to 10c. (depending on the metal), and would involve an initial investment of 3 million to  6 million.   A comparison of the cost cf providing50 cent (new penny) notes with the cost of providing equivalentcoins over a period of 50 years shows that the present value cf the savings in changing from a note to a coin is well in excess of thepresent value of the likely costs.   It is on thi3 comparison thatthe economic case for a coin rests.15.   There is also the consideration of public convenience.   Anote is easier to carry than a coin hut this advantage seemsmarginal provided the coin is not too large and heavy.   The publicis already showing an increasing tendency to treat the 10s. note asa coin, to be thrust into a pocket or purse (thus shortening itslife) rather than preserved in a wallet.   In recent years severalEuropean countries have replaced their lowest denomination notes by coins.16.   It would be possible to introduce both 50 cent (new penny)coins and notes so that, in theory, the public would have anopportunity of expressing its preference.   But this would not rrivethe coin a fair chance.   People are conservative in money matters and would probably, through habit, continue to demand notes.   Andas long as there was a substantial demand for notes the Bank ofEngland could not achieve the financial savings they hope for.   Othercountries which have introduced high-value coins have generallydone so in complete replacement of notes.
17.   A question for consideration is whether the 50 coin shouldhe in silver rather than a base metal such as cupro-nickel.   Asilver coin might well gain public favour more quickly than a basemetal one.    It could be a thin^ of beauty and nresti^e value aswell as utility.   Most European countries now have silver high -value coins and both South Africa and Australia have their topdecimal coins in silver.   A silver coin would have the furtheradvantage that it could be made more readily distiri^uiehable fromother &apos;white&apos; coins - partly because of the slight difference incolour   and partly because, for technical reasons concerned withthe coining process, it would be easier to give it distinguishingfeatures such as a 1 dished * surface.18.   The objection to a silver coin is its high cost.   If roughlyhalf-crown size it might cost about Us. to produce, of which about3s. 9d. would be for the silver.   This would represent a total investment of about  30 million, though even at the end of a50 year life most of the metal  content would be recoverable.Silver has to be imported, thus affecting our balance of payments.Moreover industrial demand for silver (e.g. for electronics andphotography) is growing and it can be argued that the limitedsupplies available are most usefully devoted to these uses ratherthan to coinage.   Further cost studies will be done on the case fora half-crown sized silver coin but it is obviously weaker than thecase for a cupro-nickel or other base metal coin (lU above).19,   It would be possible to produce a much smaller and thus muchcheaper silver coin if a shaped piece, e.g. a square one or one withscalloped edges, were acceptable.   This is because there would beless difficulty in making such a coin readily distinguishable fromother coins by sight and by touch.   But the Halsbury Committee were opposed to shaped coins, and it is certainly difficult to find ashape likely to be generally acceptable.   The view of the DeputyMaster of the Royal Mint is that any feature, such as shaping, whichmight detract from the additional virtues of quality and dignity tobe gained from silver,would invalidate the case for the use of the
the expensive metal.   In his view the choice lies between a silverand a &quot;base metal coin, both round and both roughly half-crown size.20.   The recommendation of the Official Committee is that a 50 cent(new penny) coin should be introduced instead of a 50 note, but that further consideration should be given to its size, shape and metal content.   Decisions on these latter features are not as urgentas for the other coins.The sizes of the bronze coins21.   Few would defend the size and weight of the present pennies.They are much too big for their modest value.   The question is how much smaller the decimal coins should be, bearing in mind that ifweight/value relationship is  introduced in the bronze tier, asHalsbury recommended, the room for manoeuvre on sizes is limited.22.   To eyes accustomed to the penny the Halsbury i appears verysmall and it will not be welcomed by slot machine manufacturers.But it is as big as, or bigger than, popular low value coins inmany other countries - and some of these are widely used in slctmachines.   There is a further practical problem.   If the ? is madeeven slightly bigger it would tit into the sixpenny slot of many gasand electricity meters.   Similarly the 1 cent (new penny) piece,which would also have to be bigger, would then go into many shillingslots.   Even if this problem were ignored and the Gas and electricity authorities were left to claim from customers (deficiencies arising from fraud, the scope for increasing the size of the i is small.   Given the weight/value relationship, the2 cent (new penny) piece, already slightly bigger than thehalfpenny, would have to be bigger still - probably unacceptably30 ,23.   Making the 2 a small cupro-nickel coin offers no way out.   A2 cent (new penny) cupro-nickel coin in weight/value relationship with the 5 and 10 pieces would be very close to the sixpence in size and the resulting confusion during the period when old andnew coins circulate together would be intolerable.
2Uo    In the view or the OiTiciul commit Lee the nalsbury bronze coinrecommendations should dc accepted. 1The sizes of the cupro-nickel coins25.    Shillings anil 1&apos;lorins translate exactly into     and 10 cent(new penny;  pieces.    Onl.v  Die &apos;ie:;lgn need be changed.    rheHalsbury Committee concluded that  it was out of i.:.e meatier: to change the sizes of these coins.    seeping l ami 1 lac -..u-; popularcoins at familiar values offers   )people -i nin; &apos;f paychciog j calanchor in the changeover period.    Changing these coir.:; .v;dconsiderably to the cost of the changeover for banks, an-: : orcoin-operated machine interests,    Tne additional coct rcr co,;r.-operated machine conversion alone was estimated Dy halsbury hi i+0 million.26.   There is nevertheless some case for reducing tne sizes of5 and 10 cent (new penny) coins.    As the smallest coin in tnecupro-nickel tier the shilling sized 5 is fairly big and tne :lorinsized 10 is a heavy coin by the standards of otner countries.There is virtually no complaint from the general public about thesizes of shillings and florins but there have been &apos;-economist1articles urging the case for smaller, lighter coins and South .-.fricshas recently changed its complete decimal range to introduce smallercoins equivalent to shillings and florins and to ieave room ^or handy-sized higher value coins in the same tier or metal.    If the 10 is reduced considerably below florin size it would De possible tointroduce a 20 piece in weight/value relationship.27,   There is some support for smaller 5 and 10 cent (new penny;pieces on the. Official Committee but on balance the Halsburyarguments for shilling and florin sizes are regarded as decisive.In particular the need for &quot;associability&quot; of some coins duringthe transitional period, to which other countries have attached great importance, seems very compelling.
Recommendations on sizes28.   The Official Committee therefore recommend that the Halsburyproposals for ^, 1, 2, 5, and 10 cent (new penny) coins be acceptedbut that instead of a 20 coin lh*;.re should be n 50 (to replace10s. banknotes) of a apocification to be determine&apos;.! later.Appendix A gives a chart comparing these coins v/it a the --resentones.     Consistent with Government policy on metrication,  the sizesand weights of coins should be expressed not jr. Inches ana grainsbut in centimetres   and grammes.   This involves a very slightadjustment of Halsbury measurements.Numbers of coins needed29.   Total coin requirements are estimated as follows:-	millions1 s	2,0001	2,6002	1,5005	l,u0010	1,25050	150	8,900The assumption made is that the total value of the new coinage shouldbe the same as that of the estimated value of present coins and10s. notes in 1971 - with some deduction for an increase in the useof  1 notes instead of a complete switch to coins.   The divisionamongst denominations has been estimated after consultation withthe banks and statistical authorities.30.   As the new decimal bronze coins will not be interchangeablewith existing coins a supply aimed to satisfy 100 per cent of thedemand is desirable from the outset.   Assuming that the replacement coins for the Is. and 2s. are identical with them inshape and weight, it is not essential to lave 100 per centreplacement of cupro-nickel coins available, especially asreplacement would add considerably to the production problems of
the Royal Mint and the coin handling problems of the banks.However it will be desirable to replace the cupro-nickel coinsfairly quickly and to have at least n token issue at the start.31.   The current proposal iu to aim at n minimum total productionof about 6,500 million coins by the chrmgeover date - including all the bronze coins anil the 50 piece.    It will  be for theDecimal Currency Board, however, to make detailed recommendations on the phasing of the withdrawal of existing coins m/i theintroduction of the 50,The Halfpenny32,   The proposed decimal coin series gives a lov/est value coin of1.2d as compared with the present halfpenny.   The Halstury Committeewent to great pains to satisfy itself that the halfpenny could be dispensed with and recommended its withdrawal nine months beforedecimalisation.   A few organisations, now supported by the confederation of British Industry, still see a need for a halfpennyequivalent.   The case for and against providing it in a   system is set out in Appendix B,   In the view of the Official Committeethe arguments against are very strong and Halsbury was right to conclude that retention of the   is incompatible with retentionof the halfpenny.   They therefore recommend that ministers should endorse the Halsbury proposal that the halfpenny should be withdrawn before decimalisation day.Recommendations33,   The Official Committee therefore reach the followingcpnclusions and recommend accordingly:(i)   that the minor unit be called not &apos;cent* but *new penny&apos;(though the Official Committee are not unanimous or. this);(ii)   that the best theoretical sequence of coin and banknotedenominations is -  , 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50,  1;(iii)   that it would be wrong to depart from the above sequencein order to provide a 2i cent (new penny) coin ofsixpenny size;
(iv)   that a 2 should therefore he provided from the startas well as   and 1 cent (new penny) coins;(v)    that a 20 or 25 cent (new penny) coin should not heprovided initially, but its possible introduction couldbe considered later if a need became evident;(vi)    that a 50 cent (new penny) coin should be providedinstead of a banknote;(vii)    that the       1, and 2 cent (new penny) coins should be ofbronze and in weight/value relationship;(viii)    that the Halsbury sizes for the bronze coins should beadopted but that the specifications should be adjustedvery slightly so that, consistent with declaredGovernment policy on the metric system, diameters andweights can be expressed neatly in that system asfollows:weight diameter(grammes) (centimetres)i 1.75 1.701 3.50 2,002 7.00 2 .60(ix)   that the 5 and 10 cent (new penny) coins should be incupro-nickel and of shilling and florin size respectively,the measurements being fractionally adjusted to provide&quot;round&apos; metric figures as follows:weight diameter(grammes) (centimetres)5 5.65 2.3510 11.30 2.85(x)   that the specification for the 50 cent (new penny) coinbe reserved for later decision and that further studiesbe carried out into the case for a silver as opposed to abase metal coini
.   , &quot;75(xi;    that the halfpenny should be withdrawn beforedecimalisation day and no equivalent or roughlyequivalent coin should be provided in the decimal system.S. GOLDMAN31st October. 1?66Treasury Chambers,Great George Street,LONDON, S.W.1.
