C(66) 14424th October, 1966HOMOSEXUAL LAY/ reform memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department the Y/olfenden Committee recommended that homosexual acts in private between consenting adults should cease to be unlawful,,     LordArran&apos;s Sexual Offences Bill to amend the law of England and YYales inaccordance with this recommendation has twice been through all its stages in the House of Lords.    It was passed on 28th October, 1965, by96 votes to 31 and on 16th June, 1966, by 78 votes to 60.    A similar bill introduced by Mr. Humphry Berkeley last Session was given a SecondReading in the House of Commons on 11th February, 1966, by 164 votes to 107.    The Bill was well placed to make further progress, but became a casualty of the General Election.2.       No member successful in the ballot for Private Members1 Billsthis Session wished to introduce a Bill on this subject.     But on 5th July,1966, Mr. Abse was given leave under the &apos;10-minute rule1 to introduce such a Bill by 244 votes to 100.     The Bill has not yet been published,but v/ill probably be identical with Lord Arran&apos;s Bill.3t       The recent votes show that a majority in both Houses (andparticularly now in the Fiouse of Commons) favours implementation ofthe V/olfenden Committee&apos;s recommendation,    I do not suggest that theGovernment should depart from its earlier decision to adopt a neutralattitude on the principles involved (Cn Ce (65) 28th Conclusions, Minute 5)but we shall be under considerable criticism, mainly from our own supporters, if we fail to provide a little time for Mr. Abse&apos;s Bill tomake progress.     There is also the point that, if we leave the matter in abeyance, there is difficulty in administering a part of the criminal law against which both Houses have twice pronounced.4.       I ask my colleagues to agree that half a day of Government time should be made available for a Second Reading debate on Mr. Abse&apos;bill.     This proposal has the support of the Lord President and theChief Whip.UsR.H.
