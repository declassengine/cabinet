S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)PERIOD OF SEVERE RESTRAINT:  PUBLIC service memorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretary ofState for Economic affairs at their meeting yesterday afternoon the Ministerial Committee on prices and Incomes considered a note by the Chairman of the Prices and incomes (Official) Committee, a copy of which is attached to thismemorandum, on the treatment of the public services during the periodof severe restraint.non^Industrial Civil Servants2,       There are pay research surveys outstanding affecting about140, 000 non-industrial civil servants, having operative dates on 1stJanuary, 1965, or 1st January, 1966.    We are agreed that there shouldbe no payments until 1st July, 1967, except in so far as they may bejustified under the criteria for the period of severe restraint.    On 1stJuly, 1967, the grades in question should receive increases based ontheir pay research surveys, with retrospection to a date six months later than the original operative date.    If the increases are substantial,they should be phased in two or three instalments.Other Public Service Employees3,       We also considered cases of other public service employees,where there are commitments to review from an agreed operative datebefore 30th June, 1967, but for which the amount of an increase has yet to be determined.     These employees fall into three groups:(a) Those with an agreed operative date before 20th July, 1966.(b) Those the dates of whose reviews fall between 20th July, 1966,and 31st December, 1966 (the main case being police).(c) Those the dates of whose reviews fall between 1st January and30th June, 1967 (the main case being schoolteachers).4,       We are agreed that those in the first group should receive pay-ments not earlier than 1st July, 1967 (unless they qualify for earlierpayment under the criteria for severe restraint), but that the increases should be retrospective to a date six months after the agreed operative date.     The increase would be phased if they were substantial.C(66) 15610th November, 1966CABINET
CONFIDENTIAL .        1 00X &amp;5,       We are also agreed that for those the dates of whose reviewsfall during the period of severe restraint (i. e, group (c) above) thereshould be no payment before 1st July, 1967 (except in so far as theywould be justified under the criteria) and no retrospection.6.       We have not been able to agree about the treatment for those in category (b), the dates of whose reviewed/s fail between 20th July and 31stDecember, 1966.    Some Ministers considered that those in this group should not receive any payment before 1st July, 1967 (unless payment would be justified under the criteria for severe restraint), but thatany increases given hereafter should be paid with effect from anoperative date six months later than the original date.    Thus thepolice would receive on 1st July an increase which would be backdatedto 1st March, 1967.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer and I consideredthat a general rule of this kind would be inconsistent with the trea.tm.entproposed for the private sector, and would make it very difficult for usto hold the degree of restraint proposed during the first six months of next year.    We therefore considered that no retrospection should beallowed in these cases,7.       The Home Secretary took the view that neither of theseproposals would be acceptable from the point of view of the police, towhom he believed that at any rate some rjart of their increase should bepaid from 1st March.    It was suggested in discussion that in practice the police might qualify for earlier payment in any case under the criteria, on grounds of acute shortage of manpower.    We cannot,however, be sure of this, and it is unlikely that the police would beprepared to accept this unless there was a very firm understanding thatthey would in fact qualify,    Moreover, if the police received paymentbefore 1st July, on the grounds that they satisfied one of the criteria,there would be other claims for early payments under one or other ofthe criteria from other groups of public servants (for instance, PostOffice supervisors, engineers and Post Office cleaners).8.       A further suggestion, which commanded a considerable measureof agreement, v/as that the general rule should be payment not earlier than 1st July, 1967, and no retrospection, but that the police should betreated exceptionally and allowed to receive payment on 1st July, 1967,with retrospection to 1st March.     The Home Secretary undertook toconsider whether this would be acceptable to him from the point of viewof the police.     One difficulty about this course was that it might bedifficult to explain v/hy exceptional treatment was being given to thepolice and not to the fire service, whose previous pay agreement expiredon 1st August, 1966, and for whom negotiations in respect of a new agreement had reached an advanced stage on 20th July.    We shouldhave to be clear that we could hold the police as the only exception, ifthis course were to be followed.    Subject to this, however, theChancellor of the Exchequer and I could accept this suggestion.Industrial Civil Service9.       We are agreed that the Government should give the unions an assurance that they accept a firm commitment that any increase for industrial civil servants should be calculated on the lines recommendedby the National Board for Prices and Incomes,    If this assurance canbe given, it is thought that the unions will be willing to accept that inrespect of date of payment and retrospection they should be treatedlike other public sector workers.
*     12 3Conclusion10.       The Cabinet are asked to decide upon the treatment of thosegroups of public servants the dates of whose reviews fall between 20thJuly and 31st December, 1966,    The alternatives are:(i)   To make no payments before 1st July, 1967 (except in so far asthey are in line with the criteria) and to allow no retrospection,(ii)   To make no payments before 1st July, 1967 (except in so far asthey are in line with the criteria) but to allow retrospection toa date six months later than the original review date.To make no payments before 1st July, 1967 (except in so far asthey are in line with the criteria) and to allow no retrospection(as in (i)), except for the police, who should receive from 1stJuly, 1967, an increase retrospective to 1st March,11.       There was general agreement that the position of the publicservice should be dealt with in the White Paper not by altering the criteria of manpower and comparability but by adding an extra passage.Alternative drafts for the various possible courses of action areannexed to this memorandum.M. S.Department of Economic Affairs, S.W.1,10th November   1966-3-(iii)
-4-DRAFT PASSAGE FOR INCLUSION IN THE WHITE PAPERPublic sectorEmployers and employees in the public services and publicly-ownedundertakings will be under the same obligations to observe the criteria for the period of severe restraint as the rest of the community.    Noincreases in the pay of the public services will be paid in the first half of1967 unless they can be shown to be justified under the criteria set out above.    Increases, the payment of which is deferred until after30th June, 1967, will if substantial be paid in instalments as necessary,/continued by one of three alternativesjAlternative A (course 1))Where commitments existed on or before 20th July, 1966 for apay increase or hours reduction to be operative prior to that date, butthe amount had not by then been determined, the operative date of theincrease should be deferred by six months.    Where, however,commitments existed on or before 20th July, 1966 for pay increases to be operative from a later date, the amount of which had not been determinedbefore 20th July, 1966, the operative date should be deferred until after30th June, 1967, except in so far as earlier payments can be shown to bejustified under the criteria for the period of severe restraint.Alternative B (course 2))Where commitments existed on or before 20th July, 1966 for apay increase or hours reduction to take effect before the end of 1966, the operative date should be deferred for six months.    Where suchcommitments were due to take effect in the first half of 1967 the operative date should be deferred until after 30th June.    In either case earlierpayments should be made only in so far as they can be shown to bejustified under the criteria for the period of severe restraint.Alternative C (course 3))Discussions will be held with the representatives of the groups of staff concerned on the application of these general principles in caseswhere commitments for pay increases or hours reductions existed on or before 20th July, 1966 but the amount had not been determined by then.
PERIOD OF SEVERE RESTRAINT:    PUBLIC SERVICE PAYNote by the Chairman of the prices and Incomes^OfficiaI^X.&apos;-CoMflitiee &quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the First Secretaryconsider that the outstanding Civil Service pay research surveys.affecting about 1h-0,000 non-industrial Civil Servants;, and havingoperative dates of 1st January 1965 and 1st January 1966 shouldbe dealt with as follows.     No pay increases should be given during the period of severe restraint, except in so far as theymay be justified under the revised criteria for that period.,     On1st July 1967 the grades in question should receive increasesbased on their pay research surveys, with retrospective effect totheir original operative date deferred by the six months of the standstill, subject to the granting of the increases in one, twoor three instalments according to the size of the percentage increase in pay involved.2.     Officials have considered, in the light of these views aboutthe handling of non-industrial Civil Service pay^ and the prospective criteria for the period of severe restraintv what arrangements should be made about reviews of pay in the other public services in the first half of 1967*     This paper deals withreviews for which there is an agreed operative date but for whichthe amount of an increase has yet to be determined.3.     Details of the groups of public service employees coming intothis category are given in the Annex to this paper.     These arereviews proper, not consequentials of earlier reviews.     It will beseen that they fall into three groups(a) those (e.g. Service Doctors and Dentists) in whichthere is an agreed operative date before 20th July,1966,(b) those (e.g. police) the dates of whose reviews fallduring the standstill,(c) those (e.g. teachers) the dates of whose reviewsfall during the period of severe restraint.,The operative date of pay reviews in categories (a) and (b) must inany case be deferred for six months under Cmnd. 3073;    and thepossibility of further deferment in certain cases is discussed in para, 6 below.
The operative date of any increases flowing from reviews in category (c) will under the terms of the draft White Paper be deferred -until 1st July 1967 unless increases are justifiedat an early date under the criteria for severe restraint.The date of payment of any increasesh. Following the arrangements for the non-industrial CivilService discussed in paragraph 1  above, we recommend -(a) that, unless the criteria for severe restraintcan be satisfied, no payments of increases should be made before 1st July 1967 to any ofthese categories;(b) that where/ substantial payments are authorisedto be made to any group of employees after 30thJune, 1967s consideration should be given tophasing them,The operative date of any increases 5.     More difficult, however, is the extent, if any, to which these increases as and when they are paid after 30th Junes 1967 should begiven with retrospective effect.     We have considered whetherdifferent treatment in this regard should be given to those cases in which there is a formal agreement as to operative date (e.g.Civil Service pay research cases and police) from those in whichthe commitment is moral rather than formal.     In the National health service in particular no formal agreement about operative date is normally made in advance as it is in the Civil Service.     But in suchcases it will be argued strongly that there is a moral commitmentand that retrospection should apply as much in these cases as incases where a formal agreement as to date exists.     We think thatthere is force in this argument and that different treatment in thetwo types of case would be difficult to justify.     If this is accepted,  there are a number of possible courses of actiont-(i)  to allow no retrospection at all,,     In any case it wouldbe regarded as unfair by those groups whose originaloperative dates preceded 20th July, and who, but forthe standstill, would have been due for substantialretrospection (e.g. Service Doctors and Dentists with apublished commitment to an operative date of 1st April1966).     This would be inconsistent with the proposedtreatment of the Civil Service Pay Research Surveys.-2-
Industrial Civil service.      The reason why the industrial Civil Service presents aparticular problem is that the N.B.P.I. recommended (beforethe standstill was announced) a new pay structure based incomparisons withoutside analogues to take effect, if possible,in April 1967 and that in the meantime there should be noreview in October, 1966 under the existing system.      Courses(ii) or (iii) above would require the implementation of thenew pay structure to be deferred until after 30th June 1 967except in ss far as earlier payment was justified under the severe restraint criteria.      The Unions may argue, that paymentshould be retrcspective to 1st April (course (iii)) becausethey have already lost the increase that, under currentagreements, should have been due from 1st October, 1966(though the reason for this was not the standstill but theBoard&apos;s recommendation).      However, the main concern of theUnions is that the Government should accept a firm commitment that any increases should be calculated on the lines recommended by the Board, i.e. having regard to what is being-   3 -(ii) to allow retrospection only for these groups whoseagreed or normal operative dates were or would havebeen before 20th July, 1966, &quot;&quot;rut for the standstill.This would have the merit of preventing &quot;catching-up&quot;increases from taking effect in the period of severe,restraint except in so far as the operative dateswould have been before the standstill.    But it wouldmean that other groups such as the police (whoseoperative date is the subject of a formal commitment)would have to wait for more than six months unlessan increase during the period of severe restraintcould be justified under the revised criteria.(iii) to allow retrospecticn for all those groups for whom any increases due as a result of reviews arebeing deferred by 6 months under the standstill(i.e.  categories (a) and (b)  in para.3 above).On this nasis the police, for example, could receive a general increase which was not necessarilyjustified under the severe restraint criteria from 1st July retrospectively to 1st March (six months later than their original operative date)-    On theother hand any increase paid to teachers after1st July, 1967 would not be retrospective since intheir case the deferment would only have been forthree months.      The difficulty of this course isthat it would be inconsistent with the treatment ofthe private sector.     The White Paper on the prices and incomes standstill (Cmnd.3073) said:    &quot;It would clearly defeat the intention of the standstill ifthe parties concerned were to seek to make good in subsequent negotiations any increases foregone asa result of the standstill&quot;.      This means, for examplthat a firm which would normally have reviewed its1staff salaries towards the end of 1966 - as weunderstand a good many firms do - would be expectedto defer the operative date of all increments until after Junp 1967, except in so far as they satisfy the severe restraint criteria, and would not beexpected then to pay them with retrospective effeot.
to -paid frr a hO-hour week/piece workers engaged rn similaractivities in outside employment, allowing, for example, forfringe benefits.&quot;     If Ministers agree that this assurance canbe given, the Unions would probably be willing to acceptdeferment of the operative da be and phasing, on equivalent termstr other public and private sector workers.Use^f the NLB.P.I. *7.     Ministers have already decided that some of the cases underconsideration should be referred to the N.B.P.I.  (fire serviceand local authority chief officers).      Other important casesmight similarly be referred to the Board for consideration ineach case both of the amount of the appropriate increase and ofits operative,date.Oonclusion8..   &apos; We invite Ministers to endorse the recommendations aboutthe timing of the actual payment of increases in paragraph k above.9.     We&apos;also invite Ministers to decide between the alternative courses about the operative date of increases to be paid &apos;discussed in paragraph 5 above.      In our view course (i) wouldbe unduly harsh on the public services generally and inconsistent with the proposals for the Civil Service.      Course (ii) wouldmake it clear that new increases could not be paid during theperiod of severe restraint except in so far as they satisfiedthe criteria for this period.      This would be consistent with the criteria laid down for the private sector.     It might,however, result in some public service groups (and some private sector groups) suffering a deferment of more than 6 months,and complaining that they were being treated more harshly than others.      Course (iii) would avoid any deferment for more than6 months in the public services but it would allow some newincreases to be paid with retrospective effect to a date inthe period of severe restraint even though they are not clearlyjustified under the criteria,.and ecen though the private sector[and the nationalised industries) will be expected to avoidretrospection of this sort.1.0.    We suggest that a short reference to public service payought to be made in the proposed White Paper on the period of severe restraint.     Alternative drafts for this purpose are attached.E. W.
