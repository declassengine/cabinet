W. 1.ii9th November, 1966
STATEMENT OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT[S TERMS FORA SETTLEMENT IN rhodesia the British Government have novj undertaken a review of the Rhode sianproblem in the light of the recent visit of the Commonwealth secretary and Attorney-General to Salisbury during which a statement of positions on either side was drawn up.2.     The British Government&apos;s attitude remains based on the principles which successive British Governments have insisted must govern any constitutional settlement for an independent Rhodesia.     The major areasof disagreement turn on the application of these principles, and are notmatters to be resolved merely by detailed constitutional modifica-tions.The Constitutional Settlement3.     The British Government have throughout shown their readiness to explore every possibility of reaching a settlement within these principles.   they have proposed, if it would facilitate the task of working out anindependence settlement within the stated principles, that there might bean entirely new constitutional approach.     They have further suggestedthat the assistance of constitutional experts from the Commonwealth mightbe brought in to assist in working out such a new basis for a settlement.As a further possibility, they have also proposed that a mission of commonwealth Prime Ministers might be invited to visit Rhodesia and to   ...lend their good offices in devising a solution between Rhodesia and Britain.     They have also declared themselves ready to enter into discussions about the possibility of an &quot;Act of Union&quot; between Britainand Rhodesia.     All these possibilities have been rejected out of hand.The British government&apos;s consideration of the problem has therefore been confined to the possibility of a settlement based on the 19^1 constitutionwith the changes necessary to give full effect to the stated principles.4*     It is. the British Government1s purpose that the political advancement of the Africans in Rhodesia should be brought about in a way that willpreserve good government and stability in the country, and safeguard itssocial and economic development within the concept of a society pledged to afford equal opportunity to all, regardless of race. They accept that the pace of the political advancement of the Africans should continue to be governed by achievement and merit, i.e. through the acquisition of the economic and educational qualifications prescribed under the 1961 constitution in the belief that such arrangements, if fully safeguarded in a constitutional settlement which is demonstrated to be, acceptable and is legally enacted,would be in the best interests of the Africans, the British Government(1)
hope that the Africans would participate fully in working then:    and theyrenew their previous offer of assistance towards the development of educational and econonic opportunities for the Africans.     The BritishGovernment, however, are not prepared to agree that African advancementnight after independence be arbitrarily held back through the operationof powers left in the hands of the European ninority, if the latterjudged at any tine that the advent of African majority rule would bo&quot;premature&quot;.     Such a provision would be incompatible with the principleof unimpeded progress to majority rule.f I5.     The British Government must therefore continue to insist that theprovisions of Chapter III of the 1961 constitution (which deal with thenumber and delimitation of constituencies and electoral districts) mustbo specially entrenched in any independence constitution.6.     As regards safeguards for the specially entrenched   clauses of theconstitution, the British Government would accept, as part of the necessary machinery, a Senate consisting of twelve Europeans and twelve Africans,which would vote together with the Lower House.     They consider however that the elected element among the Africans should be increased, to constitute an effective blocking quarter.     There should therefore be notless than nine elected African members of the Senate, though the BritishGovernment would be prepared to see up to three Chiefs included:    and thenumber of B Roll Seats in the Assembly should be increased fron fifteen toseventeen.7.     The British Government have throughout insisted that any independenceconstitution must contain safeguards for specially entrenched clauses as effective as those provided in Section 108 of the 1961 constitution:    andit is for this reason that their proposal for an external authority whichwould finally decide on such amendments has been put forward.8.     The British Government would be prepared to see the external authoritybrought into operation not by automatic reference to it of everyconstitutional Bill concerned with anendnent of a specially entrenchedolause (as envisaged in their original proposals), but by a systen ofappeal against such an amendment.     The amendment would not cone into force until the tine for appeal had expired or the appeal had been finallydisposed of.     Such an appeal night lie in the first instance to a&quot;Constitutional Commission&quot; in Rhodesia, consisting of the Chief Justice andother judges:   with further appeal as of right to the Judicial Committee ofthe Privy Council.     The grounds of appeal should be that the amendmentdiscriminated or bad the effect of discriminating unjustly between the races,or contravened any of the provisions of the declaration of rights containedin the constitution.
9.     The British Government cannot accept the abolition of cross-votingor the fade-out of B Roll Seats, since these would be incompatible withthe first and third principles.     The B Roll franchise would he extendedto all Africans over thirty by appropriate amendment of the second schedule to the constitution.The Fifth Principle10.   It remains tho position of the British Government that any constitutional settlement for an independent Rhodesia must be demonstratedto their satisfaction by a fair and free test to be acceptable to thepeople of Rhodesia as a whole.     Until this test has been carried out,there can be no question of inviting the British Parliament to. legislate for independence.11.   If informal agreement oan be reached on the form of a constitutional settlement, which meets their requirements, the British Government will beready to stand by that as the basis for negotiation with a legal governmentand for the eventual testing of Rhodesian opinion.     But they cannot accept that the testing of opinion should take place before there has been a return to constitutional government in Rhodesia, the censorship has beenlifted, and individuals detained on political grounds released and normalpolitical activities permitted provided they are conducted peacefully anddemocratically and without intimidation from any quarter,12.   They remain of the view that a Royal Commission should be appointedto test opinion in Rhodesia.     They would accept that the composition ofthe Commission and the methods by which opinion should be tested should beagreed with the legal interim administration when it is established.Return to Legality13.   The British Government adhere to the view that, before there can beany formal negotiation of an independence settlement, a constitutional government must be established in Rhodesia.     A settlement negotiated onany other basis could not hope to secure the acceptance of the people of rhodesia as a whole, or of the British Parliament, or of the general world community.12f.   The British Government therefore require as the first step theappointment by the Governor of a broadly-based Representative Governmentad interim.     This must be and be seen to be a fresh start - a Governmentof national unity representing the widest possible range of public opinionof all races in the country.
15.   The Rhodesian Parliament nust be in abeyance during the interim period, since it would not be appropriate for the interim government tobe responsible to the present assembly.     rhodesian Ministers would beappointed by and responsible to the Governor who would normally act ontheir advice in all internal matters of administration, subject to his control of the armed forces and police as described in paragraph 17 below.16.   Free expression   of opinion would be assured by the removal of censorship and the assumption by the Governor of responsibility for thenational broadcasting and television services.17.   The armed forces and police would, cone under the direct responsibilityof the Governor during this period, while the Governor would normally acton the advice of members of the interim government in matters eonqerningthe armed forces and police and law and order, the British Governmentwould need to be satisfied that he retained powers in his discretion notonly to deal with domestic disturbance and illegality but also to prevent a repetition of unconstitutional action and to protect human rights.The British Government would reserve the right to provide military assistance for these purposes if this is required by the Governor in thisperiod.     Similarly, the British Government would reserve the right, underthe independence constitution, to provide such,assistance,if this isnecessary as a further guarantee of the agreed constitution. &apos;;Racial Discrimination and Land Apportionment18.   The British Government cannot accept that there is no case for anyfurther action to give effect to the fourth principle.     They repeat theirminimum requirement that, as a contribution towards this, a Royal commission should be set up to study the problems of racial discrimination and inparticular land apportionment in Rhodesia.Conclusion19.   This statement by the British Government spells out in practicalform the action necessary to give effect to the principles which theBritish Government has clearly and consistently stated.     It is now aquestion whether a return to constitutional rule can be achieved and asettlement worked out.     Otherwise, the consequences for Rhodesia and indeed for the whole of Central and Southern Africa will be incalculable.The British Government for their part stand firmly by the undertakings towhich they are committed by the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; communiquein September.
REPLY TO STATEMENT OF BRITISH GOVERNMENT&apos;S TERMS FOR A settlement in RHODESIA&quot;The Rhodesian Government have examined the document headed &quot;statementof the British Government&apos;s terms for a settlement in Rhodesia&quot; which was delivered to the Rhodesian Prime Minister fay Sir Morrice James Deputy UnderSecretary at Commonwealth Office, on Saturday, 15th Octofaer 19&amp;6.2.     During the visit of the Secretary of State for Commonwealth affairs to Rhodesia in September, the respective positions of the British andRhodesian Governments were analysed.     The analysis demonstrated that therewas no prospect of a negotiated settlement unless each side were to make some move towards the other.     The terms submitted fay the British Governmentindicated disappointing inflexibility on their part and that they havescarcely moved towards the Rhodesian position.3.     The Rhodesian Government now submit their comments on the Britishstatement.i british Paragraph 34.     The claim is made that the British Government have throughout showntheir readiness to explore every possibility of reaching a settlement.A whole year has now elapsed since Rhodesia declared her independence.     Inthat period the British Government have made no effort to seek a negotiated settlement with the Rhodesian Government;    indeed for a long time they refused even to talk with the Rhodesian Government, and when they did theircommunique conveyed that the talks wore exploratory and without commitments.Therefore it would seem that they have never seriously contemplated a negotiated settlement with the Rhodesian Government.     It is evident thatthey are hopeing for Rhodesia&apos;s capitulation to open the Way for theimposition of a new constitution fashioned to their own ends after a periodof direct rule.5.     The paragraph distorts facts in a manner that serves only to aggravatefeelings.     The British Government&apos;s proposal that there might fae an entirely new constitutional approach and their other similar suggestions were notrejected out of hand fay Rhodesia.     The fact is the Rhodesian Prime minister pointed out to the Secretary of State that the exploration of any settlementnot &quot;based on the 1961 constitution would take as long as one year or eventwo years to complete, which would, in prevailing circumstances be undesirable.     Moreover, It would involve seeking a frech mandate from the electorate with all the complications this would entail.     The Secretary ofState concurred with this view.     The British Government have been well aware(5)
SECRET , AO108of the desire of Rhodesians to reach a settlement on a basis of the 1961constitution which they had been led to believe was the threshold to independence.     Having regard also to the historical background to thesituation and to the exclusion of Rhodesia from the Commonwealth forum long before her declaration of independence, also to the continuous maliciousattacks which have been made upon Rhodesia in that forum, and alsovto thegeneral distrust which the handling of Rhodesian affairs by successive british governments have engendered in minds of Rhodesians, it is little wonder thatthese generalised proposals and suggestions of the British Government havenot been received with any confidence.British Paragraphs 4, 5 and 96.     The Rhodesian Government note that it is the British Government&apos;s purposethat the political advancement of the Africans in Rhodesia should be broughtabout in a way that will preserve good Government stability in the country,and safeguard its social and economic development within the concept of asociety pledged to afford flexible opportunity to all, regardless of race.The Rhodesians subscribed to this idea but have misgivings about the way inwhich the British Government propose to achieve it.     Recent happenings in africa raise serious doubts about the wisdom of forcing the pace of Africanpolitical advancement.     The Rhodesian approach, on the other hand, providesopportunity for the growth of respect for tradition and convention which isa cardinal feature of any well-ordered society and is essential for a trulydemocratic Parliamentary system.     The British Government&apos;s terms seize uponevery means of accelerating the pace to majority rule, to a degree which, inthe Rhodesian Government&apos;s view, would not only defeat the purpose, butindicate a disregard of the principles which the British Government themselves have laid down in paragraph 4- of their statement.     It is the Rhodesiansnot the British people, who ?rauld suffer from the consequences of theinstitution of ill-advised constitutional provisions.7.     It is with these general considerations in mind that the rhodesian government submit the follov/ing proposals:-(a)   that the B roll franchise be extended to include all maleAfricans over 30 years of age;    providing that the cross-voting system is eliminated.     The effect of thisproposal would be to enfranchise at lea.st 400,000 Africansalthough they will not have the minimum qualificationswhich even the British Government accept as necessary formeasuring achievement and merit.     However, to preserve this principle of maintaining standards, it is necessary to eliminate cross-voting.     The cross-voting system is complicated and the effects are not readily understood by many voters and candidates.     The misunderstanding of theeffects will be accentuated by the addition of 400,000 voterswho have not even the elementary B roll qualifications;
00that the present 15 B roll electoral districts hespecially entrenched.     This replaces an earlierproposal for fade-out of these Seats and renovesany British Government&apos; s fears of reduction of african representation in the assembly or ofdisenfranchisenent of B roll voters; u(c)   that an additional 15 Seats he reserved for Europeansin the Legislative Assembly, such Seats to be phased-in as African advancement on the A rolldevelops for each African elected on the A roll,one European reserved Seat would be created, untilthe maximum of 15 was reached.Having regard to the existence of the 15 B roll Scats which will, inpractice, be African Seats and to the British Government&apos;s sixth principle,it is logical to provide 15 reserved Seats for Europeans.     These, togetherwith the European representatives in the Senate, would form a blockingquarter.     Without these additional Seats it would bo possible in time for there to be no European in the Legislative Assembly, thereby frustrating thesecond and sixth principles.8.     The British Government continue to insist that the provisions of chapter III of 1961 constitution must be specially entrenched.     the rhodesian Government are prepared to agree to the special entrenchment ofall the provisions of Chapter III with the exception of Section 57, subjectto paragraph 7(b).     This section determines the number of constituencies andelectoral districts.     It would be unprecedented for the Assembly to be deprived of its right to increa.se its membership through additionalconstituencies when expansion and growth of the country so demands.British Paragraph 69.     This paragraph refers to safeguards for the specially entrenched clauses of the constitution.     Here there is wide measure of agreement.     both governments accept a Senate   of 24 persons consisting of 12 Europeans and12 Africans and that on amendments to the specially handled clauses of theconstitution, the Senate would vote together with lower house, with one .quarter forming an effective block.     However, of the 12 Africans in the senate, the Rhodesian Government believe there should be 6 Chiefs and elected Africans, whereas the British Government believe there should be9 elected Africans and only 3 chiefs.     In last year&apos;s negotiations the rhodesian Government had contemplated a Senate   of 12 chiefs alone.     the senate is the natural and proper place for the representation of the chiefsalong with others, for a Senate, in contrast to a lower house, is an organfor the representation of groups, not of aggregates of individual voters, a.ndchiefs, above all, are the spokesmen of the tribal entitles with their own(7)
secret *        HOinternal and long established arrangements for sounding and expressing the will of their peoples.     These arrangements are realistic in the sense thatthey are understood, familiar and functional.     The Western device of the ballot box, in a tribal context, is exotic, misunderstood and mustrustedas has been only too clearly demonstrated by the events in one country after another in Africa.     The chiefs are given their positions and derive their authority to speak for their people from complex rites of succession uniqueto each tribe, and it is more accurate to consider them as social institutionsrather than individuals.     As institutions they are accepted and respectedas the representatives of the groat bulk of the African population.     when a chief speaks he does so as the collective voice of his people and the verynature of his position binds him to do so in the interest of his people. iIn today&apos;s context the carrying out of their traditional and public dutiesinvolved them in expense and to suggest that the modest recompense they receive in this connection turns them into servants of the Government isabsurd.     A representation of 6 chiefs elected by an electoral college of .chiefs to the Senate is the minimum which the Rhodesian Government consideradequate and necessary to give full and realistic communal representationto the Africans, the vast majority of whom are tribesmen, and to do justice to the vital and important status and role the chiefs are accorded bytheir people.     Whatever the British Government might feel about chiefsbelonging to a bygone age, it is to be noted that the constitutions granted by Britain to Lesotho and Botswana make provision for senates or upper houses of chiefs.10.   As minimum African representation in both houses under the foregoingproposals would exceed the number required to provide an effective block to amendment of the specially entrenched clauses, the British proposal toincrease B roll seats in the Assembly from 15 to 17 is unnecessary and undesirable.British Paragraphs 7 and 811.   As regards further safeguards for specially entrenched clauses the rhodesian Government are prepared to consider a system of appeal to an internal authority - possibly a constitutional commission in Rhodesia, onthe lines of British proposal, but they are not willing to accept the proposalfor a right of further appeal to an external authority.     The establishmentof such an external authority \vould not be compatible with independence.The proposal that the grounds of appeal should be that the amendmentsdiscriminated unjustly between the races would be acceptable, but the rhodesian Government have serious doubts about the acceptability of aprovision for appeal on the grounds that the amendment had the effect ofdiscriminating.     The proposal that the grounds of appeal should includecontravention of the provisions of the declaration of rights, would have theeffect of making the declaration of rights immutable.
IllBritish Paragraph 18 12.   With regard to the British suggestion for a commission to study problemsof racial discrimination and land apportionment the Rhodesian Governmentpoint out that in Rhodesia land apportionment legislation is continuallybeing amended to meet the changing conditions while racial discriminationwhich is, of course, not unique to Rhodesia, is constantly being reduced in a practical manner.     Accordingly, the Rhodesian Government believessuch a commission would serve no purpose.     However, they are prepared todiscuss the suggestion.British Paragraphs 10 to 1713.   The Rhodesian Government recognise that the British Government areentitled to satisfy themselves that any settlement, the form of which hasbeen agreed upon beforehand by the two Governments, is acceptable to thepeople of Rhodesia as a whole.     when the form of settlement has been agreed,the Rhodesian Government would co-operate with the British Government todetermine the procedures required for testing the fifth principle.     once this stage has been completed and a new constitution has been finally determined by the Governments, the Rhodesian Government would be prepared toenter into discussions with the British Government bringing the newconstitution into legal force and effect.     The Rhodesian government believes that it must be obvious to all that they could not contemplate theabandonment of the 19^5 Constitution until a settlement has been arrangedand secured.Conclusions14.   It now seems clear that the differences between the two Governmentsregarding the changes to be made to the 1961 Constitution are not now so great that they cannot be bridged by negotiations.     The Rhodesian government therefore invite the Secretary of State to come to Salisbury with full powers to reach final agreement on the settlement.&quot;(9)
