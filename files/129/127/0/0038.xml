DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government 8C(66) 179 COPY NO. ,_____9th December, 1966CABINETRHODESIAMemgrandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth affairs,      fotroductionAt the Commonwealth Prime ministers Conference in1September we secured two reuults g-(i)    We gained time and obtained the acquiescence of commonwealth Prime Ministers that we should give the regime a further chance to end the rebellion.(ii) We made a commitment to proceed with mandatorysanctions and to declare &quot;no independence before majority rule&quot; (aabmr) before the end of the year if the rebellion were not ended.Mr, Smith&apos;s rejection of the working document now leaves us no alternative but to proceed in accordance with the commonwealth conference agreement.2.     United Nations action we are proposing in the Security Council effective andselective economic mandatory sanctions against Rhodesia,    It isvitally important that these sanctions should be limited in form andshould not lead to the risk of escalation into economic warfare with south Africa,    The Commonwealth fully understood this and acceptedthe position at the Commonwealth Conference, though they will undoubtedly press for the inclusion of oil in a form not limited to imports from Mozambique (as we had suggested at the Conference),We hope, however, to be able to secttre a resolution in a form whichshould be acceptable to us -- though, of course, if South Africa and portugal do not comply with the resolution, there will subsequently arisedemands for enforcement measures against them.    Howeverimpracticable these maybe and indeed whatever reservations we ourselves may make now, we are likely to come under embarrassingpressure.    It will be a difficult operation to secure the passage of aresolution in an acceptable form in any case and it cannot be assumed that we shall necessarily be successful.     The passions of the Africans
J33S341have certainly not been lessened by the knowledge of the lengths to whichwe were prepared to go in order to try and reach a settlement with the regime.    If no agreement can be reached at the Security Council or ifthere should be the necessary majority for extreme measures (whichwe could only defeat by using the veto) the position will be a difficult one and we shall have to reconsider our policy.On the assumption, however, that we are successful in limiting the scope of the resolution, the prospect is that mandatory sanctionswill come into force and will have a substantial, but not crippling,effect on the Rhodesian economy.    An assessment is contained inJIC(66) 81 which may be summarised as followsThe cumulative effect by September, 1967 of mandatory-sanctions added to existing sanctions could be a reductionof the order of 25 per cent [a,5 compared with something like15 per cent at present/ in the general level of economic activity in Rhodesia since before idi.    Rhodesians couldhowever at the cost of some reduction in the standard ofliving, continue to withstand even more severe mandatorysanctions almost indefinitely provided they could count on the support of South Africa, particularly for oil supplies.     The prospect of no legal independence before majority rule would be likely to cause the great majorityof white Rhodesians to rally to the regime.     This attitudecould well outlast the will and ability of some tradingnations to implement sanctions.Nevertheless, particularly if oil imports are included withinthe terms of the Security Council resolution, attention is likely to concentrate on any breaches of the embargo by South Africa and portugal.3.     South africa the attitude of South Africa is crucial to the whole problem of rhodesia and particularly to any question of economic sanctions.Rhodesia is land-locked and has always drawn the majority of her supplies or sent her exports through (or to) South Africa andMozambique.    No embargo can be fully effective if these two territories do not co-operate.The South African attitude has consistently been that they willnot interfere with &quot;normal trade&quot; and that they will not undertakeany economic &quot;boycotts&quot;.     They have made it clear that their attitudewill remain the same if mandatory sanctions were passed.    With thedeclaration of nibmr the South Africans are likely increasingly to identify the Rhodesian cause as their own and will no longer be willingto urge on the regime that they should reach a settlement on our terms.Nevertheless they have a strong legalistic approach to problems,regard Rhodesia as a British responsibility and have never formallyrecognised the illegal regime.    Moreover they will be very anxious not to put the spotlight on themselves by a flagrant defiance of a mandatory resolution.    Any further international action over SouthWest Africa may increase this anxiety.jl3h33s
On balance therefore it is most likely that South Africa will fail to comply.     There would then be three courses open to uss-(i)    To do nothing (in the hope of preserving our owntrade with South Africa and of not shaking confidence in the British economy),(ii)   At the other extreme, to be prepared for measuresleading to confrontation with South Africa.(iii)   Alternatively we could invite consultation on thesematters with the South African Government,This would be in continuation of the exchangesrecently between the Prime Minister andMr. Vorster.     The object would be to have a frankdiscussion with the South Africans and to see whether there were any practical steps which could be takento lessen the aid and conf ort at present being givento Rhodesia.The first course would leave us  open to violent attack in theUnited Nations and in the Commonwealth,    The second course wouldinvolve unacceptable risk to the British economy and has been ruled out by Ministers,    The third course is recommended, but since theSouth African Government are unlikely to go back on their p^^blicdeclarations and would only operate unobtrusively, our exchangeswith them should be conducted unobtrusively and we should not beseen to be trying to exert pressure, as would be involved in a ministerial visit.4.      Position in RhodesiaMuch will depend on reactions among Europeans as a whole tothe triple factors:-(i)   smith s rejection of our offer.(ii)   Mandatory Sanctions.(iii)   nibmr.One may hope that the rejection of our offer will cause somedissension in the ranks of the Rhodesia Front and certainly will lead some sections of European opinion to realise that the regimehave placed party interests before the interests of the nation.    our propaganda must make the maximum effort to exploit these differences.    But unless a change is produced immediately it may bea long time before it shows itself.    In this process the continuation of sanctions should produce an increasing effect.Nevertheless, after the failure of the talks on HMS Tigerand particularly after our undertaking on nibmr comes into force,it will be virtually impossible to reach a settlement with the present regime,    The most we can hope for is that in course of time (and itmay be a long time) the opposition to the regime will assert itself and we may be able to start afresh with a new team.
But in the meantime we should encourage the Governor to stay as a focus of loyalty, and fortunately he continues to remainrobust and will carry on as long as he can.    So long as he remainsit would probably be in our interests to retain the British ResidualMission if we can to keep in contact with him.    There is always a chance that it will be thrown out by the regime, in which event, ofcourse, we would take parallel action with the Mission in London.We undertook at the Commonwealth Conference (as one ofthe related consequences) to withdraw all previous proposals for a constitutional settlement and stated that we would not be preparedto submit to the British Parliament any settlement which involvesindependence before majority rulec    It is clear that this would not become operative until the passage of a resolution by the security council with the full support of Commonwealth representatives at theUnited Nations.    There is no need for any specific declaration, butit will become operative when the resolution   has been passed and nodoubt this will be made clear in Parliament.     We should make itclear to the Europeans that, though their independence underEuropean rule is precluded by nibmr, nevertheless they may look forward, if they return to legality, to return to something on the linesof the 1961 Constitution.    That will mean possibly a long period ofGovernment prior to majority rule during which the Africans will beprepared for their responsibilities and the general administration ofthe country continue much as before idi.Whether or not the regime purports to declare a republicremains to be seen.    There are powerful considerations against iteven from their own point of view.    If they should do so our difficulties (e. g. in retaining the Governor and the Residual Mission)will be increased and it will be impossible to negotiate a settlement with them.In the event of a declaration of a republic we have already agreed that the British Government should advise all public servants in Rhodesia not to continue to serve the regime.5.      Alternative CoursesBefore embarking on the present phase Ministers consideredpossible alternative courses of action, includingj-(a) military invasion;(b) mandatory sanctions against South Africa;(c) handing over to the United Nations,Overwhelming objections to any of these courses were seen at thetime and the governing factors remain the same.    Nevertheless thepolitical scene has been changed in the new phase which we areentering and we should review our public attitudes.    It was made clear on board HMS Tiger that in the event of a second udi wewould reserve the right to use military force.    It may be argued thatwe should make a similar reservation after the regimeJs rejection of
our offer and some of our friends (including the Americans) have urged that we should de-emphasise the categorical character of our previous statements.     On the other hand, the military factors havenot changed and any admission by us that the situation is one in whichwe considered that force could properly be used, would lead totremendous pressure from the Afro-Asians that we should use it.Similarly, while the idee, of transfer of responsibility to theUnited Nations has its attractions, we have never been able to devise a way in which this could be dene satisfactorily and could get us offthe hook, and such action on our part would of course give the regimethe justification they are looking for to declare a republic.    Never-theless, while the time has clearly not yet come for us to be able toget responsibility for Rhodesia transferred to the United Nations, ifmandatory sanctions fail in their effect this may well prove the leastdamaging course open to us.6.      The commonwealth the undertakings we gave at the Conference in September were designed to save the Commonwealth, and v/e succeeded in doing so.Our present action stems directly from the Conference decisions.Nevertheless African passions run high and we cannot be sure thatwe shall be able to count on their full support, still less on anabsence of criticism.    In any case v/e sha.il continue to have a majortask to keep our relations with the Commonwealth, countries in africa in good repair, and our Specia.1 Representative in Africa,Mr. Malcolm MacDonald, will need to remain in very close contact with all the African leaders.Much will depend on whether agreement is reached on aresolution at the Security Council and how things work out thereafter.We cannot overlook the commitment at the last Conference that&quot;Prime Ministers would meet again soon if the illegal regime werenot brought to an end speedily&quot;.    We shall undoubtedly be held tothis, though no doubt a period of some three months will be allowedto judge the effectiveness of the new mandatory sanctions.Presumably the Commonwealth Sanctions Committee will keep theseunder continuous review.7.      BritishInterestsThe outstanding British interest is to achieve a settlementof the Rhodesian problem as speedily as possible.     With Mr, Smithrsrejection of our last offer, however, there seems to be no honourableway of doing so by agreement.    Indeed, in addition to the directmoral responsibility which we ourselves bear, there are ourspecific undertakings to the Commonwealth and the commitments which v/e have entered at the United Nations.    Both for reasons ofBritish policy and for reasons of our external interests there is no alternative to our determination to end the rebellion.
On the other hand British economic interests must equallybe taken into account and there is a point beyond which we cannot afford to be driven.    The loss to the British balance of paymentsalready incurred under the sanctions against Rhodesia is set out below;-Jmports nil exports 20Current Invisibles (including shipping,civil aviat5.on, insurance, etc) 12Private Investment 6Total of current and long-te::,.n capitalbalance of payments items&apos;6 in addition there are the cost of assistance to Zambia,which might be put at   7 million or   0 million for the full year in balance of payments terms; and the cost of honouring Rhodesianinternational obligations guaranteed by the United Kingdom, whichwould be about  2^ million in 1966 as a whole, making a totaladverse effect on the balance of payments of the order of 5 0 million.These figures exclude the effect of increases in the priceof copper, whether Rhodesian or Zambian.    This figure is verydifficult to estimate but almost certainly does not exceed  2 0 million.This is a sufficient strain and it will be awkward, to say the least,if it continues for any considerable length of time.    But it will notbe increased by the passage of mandatory sanctions, since virtually all trading between this country and Rhodesia has ceased already.l s however, there were to be a confrontation with SouthAfrica, there would be a loss of over S.250 million of exportsextremely difficult to make good elsewhere;  a fall in world supplies of a number of important commodities, including copperand wool, sufficient to cause a large rise in prices and addconsiderably to our import bill; the loss, net, of about  60 million of investment income and over  20 million of other invisible exports.The continued effect on the United Kingdom balance of payments would be very serious.In present circumstances - and indeed in any circumstances -this is a price which we cannot afford to pay and we must at all costsinsist that we are not drawn into economic warfare with South Africa.We therefore have to follow a middle course designed to ensurethat we do not do irreparable damage either to our external politicalinterests or to our domestic economic interests.    If agreed action is taken in the Security Council in accordance with the commonwealth conference communique, we should be able to hold the position withother Commonwealth countries at least for a period, particularlyafter we have declared nibmr.
The one doubtful country is Zambia.    Idi has come as apsychological shock to Zambia, particularly because of the largenumber of Europeans on the Copper Belt., and our relations with her have been strained.    If Zambia were to break with us or therewere to be instability in the country, the cost to us could be considerable.    We are dependent on Zambia for 40 per cent of ourcopper imports costing  63. 3 million in the first ten months of 1966.If Zambia!s copper supplies were cut off, the additional cost wouldbe far greater.Though concerted action by all African countries against us is unlikely, it should be pointed out that our economic interestsin Black and White Africa are about equally balanced.    The figures are as followsComparative Table^Black africa south africa and S. W. AfricaA,   Stocks(i)   U. K. Investment  450 m  700 m(ii)   Sterling Balances  45 0 m Very SmallB.

C onclusionOur policy should be to bring economic sanctions to the pitchof maximum effectiveness, only limited by the need to avoidconfrontation with South Africa.    We should take all steps possiblein order to secure as much practical co-operation from SouthAfrica as can be devised.    At the same time, though we cannotcount on early effectiveness, we should do what we can to bring home to the Europeans in Rhodesia their sense of isolation in theworld, the hopelessness of any future under the present regime and what a settlement now would involve.-7-
SECRET Qx 1No-one can see at present what developments there might be,but it is not impossible that at a later stage a situation might arise in which we could look for assistance to further parties.    Australiaand New Zealand stand out in particular as countries which are likelyto have an appeal to the Europeans in Rhodesia.    Canada and theUnited States are also deeply concerned and would help to carryconviction with the African world.   One cannot foresee in whatprecise form their services could be used, but we should keep inmind the possibility of taking advantage of their good offices.    Weshould not exclude the possibility that South Africa and Portugalmay also be able to help.Failing all else it seems that we must reconcile o^^rselves tothe prospect of a long haul.    II so, we shall inevitably have to face the embarrassment of a continuous barrage of criticism in theCommonwealth and at the United Nations.    But it seems vinlikelythat there will be an early break in morale in Rhodesia and we mayhave to wait for the time when, as a result of the pressures exertedby sanctions and by our propaganda, there may arise an oppositionto the regime and new men with whom we could deal.    But we mustface the fact that this may be a considerable time ahead and that thefactor of most importance - namely the degree of support from south Africa - is, if not beyond our influence,   at least beyond.&quot;our influence, at least beyond our control.    Indeed if South africa is prepared to give sufficient support to the regime, Rhodesia may eventually fall within the South African orbit.H.B.Commonwealth Office, S. W. 1.9th December, 196611.-8-
