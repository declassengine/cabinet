europe memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 1st November the Cabinet were in &quot;general agreement onthe need for the Government to demonstrate the sincerity of our desire to join the European Economic Community (e.c.) if our requirements could be met.    To defer action, in order to give timefor the strengthening of our economy, would be widely assumed to mean that we had lost interest in joining:  our friends in the EECwould be profoundly discouraged and the cohesion of the European free trade Association (EFTA) would be at risk. &quot;2.      The problem at issue is how to obtain from the Governments ofthe Six indications of how our special difficulties could be met if we decided to apply for membership of the e.c..    Until we have suchindications, we cannot decide whether or not to apply.    We cannotembark on the probing necessary to obtain these indications unless theGovernments of the Six are made to realise that we are in earnest.The immediate point is thus what step should be taken in order to prove that Her Majesty&apos;s Government are in earnest.3.      As a preliminary to the necessary probing, three main ideashave been under discussion:(a) A meeting of EFTA Heads of Government.    This was an ideaput forward for the first time in Cabinet on 1st November.(b) Early visits to the capitals of the Six by the Prime Ministerand Foreign Secretary.    This was an idea which was putforward at the Chequers meeting on 22nd October.(c) A declaration that Her Majesty*s Government were preparedto accept the Treaty of Rome, subject to receivingsatisfaction on the points on which we saw difficulty.If any of the above courses were adopted, that would be followed by,and would be inseparable from;(d) The probing which we need to undertake in greater depth andwhich would respond to invitations we have had (but not taken up) from some of the Five.DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 146 COPY NO.    7 42nd November, 1966CABINET
4.       The ideas at (c) and (d) above (which in effect represent onesingle process of probing) were put forward in the paper jointlycirculated by the First Secretary of State and myself in preparation for the Chequers meeting.5.       It goes without saying that a major step of any of the kindsindicated above cannot be embarked on before we have carefully con-sidered what action would be appropriate in order to ensure that our obligations to our EFTA and Commonwealth partners are met (seeparagraph 9 below).6.       A meeting of EFTA Heads of Government (possibility (a) above)has certain attractions if we are thinking solely in terms of buying timewhile we strengthen our economy.    But we must buy time in a way that suggests forward movement to our friends in e.c.;  and in thisrespect as well as in others the serious disadvantages in an EFTAsummit outweigh the solitary advantage mentioned above.     One of thereasons why our leadership is implicitly accepted in EFTA, whererelations with e.c. are concerned, is that we are in a median positionbetween those (e. g. Austria, Denmark) who want to go much faster,and those (Portugal, Switzerland and to a lesser extent Sweden) who are more reticent than we.    An EFTA summit is not likely to change this situation and could hardly result in our receiving agreed advice from ourEFTA partners or in any consensus being reached.    Moreover, evenif a consensus were achieved, this could produce pressure within EFTAeither for additional commitments within the EFTA framework (whichcould be embarrassing for us) or for some kind of joint negotiation between EFTA and e.c. - and this, as we know, is unacceptable toEEC, even if we ourselves could accept it.    But we could hardly do so,not least because the problems of the other EFTA countries are different from ours.    We might well find that in certain matters an unholyalliance would develop between some of our EFTA partners (e. g. the danes) with the e.c. to press for concessions on which we had the best of reasons to hold back.    In sum, a meeting of EFTA Heads ofGovernment might seriously complicate our own eventual negotiatingposture without appearing to opinion both in this country and in europe as the kind of decisive step forward that is now required.7.       As regards (b), I warmly supported the idea of visits by thePrime Minister and myself to the capitals of the Six.    Such visitswould be an effective way of countering any doubts about the seriousness of our intentions and would inaugurate the process of probing in depthwhich is necessary,8.       If, on the other hand, my colleagues consider that such a tourmight appear too dramatic, or see difficulties (I myself do not think they need be serious) arising from the present political situations inGermany and Holland, I would be equally prepared-to accept course (c),coupled with course (d).9.       I at no time envisaged any overt move or the adoption of any ofthe courses set out above without prior information to EFTA governments and Commonwealth Governments.    As regards EFTA, the immediate question is whether our EFTA partners v/ould feel hurt because what wetold them came so soon after the Lisbon meeting when we could tell themnothing.    My own view is that it will be sufficient to notify EFTA rather
than to consult them.    Our EFTA colleagues made it clear at Lisbonthat they expected us to take the lead.    We (and they) know that anylong period of notice to them (48 hours would be the outside) would bring danger of a leak.    In which case our announcement would loseits effect.    For these reasons I think that notification as opposed to consultation is indicated and that no more would be expected by EFTA.The same considerations would appear to apply to the commonwealth and, in the case envisaged, to notify them would be consonant with what we undertook in the Commonwealth Prime ministers communique last september.10,       To sum up, two courses are open to us.    First, the course the Prime Minister proposed at Chequers (alternative (b) above).This, as the Prime Minister said in his summing-up at Chequers, wouldinvolve our being prepared, if asked whether we could accept the Treatyof Rome, to say that, provided that we received satisfaction on the points on which we saw difficulty, adherence to the Treaty would not initself be a sticking point.    The second course is to declare acceptanceof the Treaty of Rome and to probe in depth (alternative (c) and (d)).Although it was not my own proposal, I would prefer the course proposed by the Prime Minister,    If, however, my colleagues rejectit, then I think that the second course ((c) and (d) in combination) mustbe accepted as the right one.    Were both courses to be rejected then i must say plainly that I do not see that any further probing is possible.It would be a mistake to suppose that we could put a moratorium onprobing and then resume it as if nothing had happened.    A moratoriumwould be equivalent to dropping probing altogether and that would be disastrous for us both as regards the e.c. and EFTA.G.B.Foreign Office, S.W.1.2nd November, 1966
