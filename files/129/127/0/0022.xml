C(66) 163 COPY NO.   fi 711th November, 1966CABINETPARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE and specialist COMMITTEESMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilWe face in the next few weeks a debate on procedure in theHouse of Commons.    I mention below a number of the points whichare most likely to arise.2.     Financial procedure Select Committee on Procedure have made 19 recommenda-tions.     (They are listed in the Appendix with comments on them. )   Mostare acceptable.    Those that need legislation may possibly be dealt within a Finance Bill.3.     Specialist committees the appointment of a Select Committee on Science and technology would have the support of the Opposition who have suggestedthat it might start with a study of the annual reports of the research councils and the University Grants Committee policy towards science and technology.       Perhaps I may be authorised to agree terms ofreference with the Secretary of State for Education and Science.The Opposition would also in addition accept, experimentallyfor one year, a committee on the work of a single Department.   Butin view of the fact that we have had difficulty in finding a suitableMinistry, it may be that we shall not be able to take up this offer.    Aswe must soon appoint a Select Committee to supervise the work ofthe Parliamentary Commissioner, I fear, therefore, that for this session we must be content with a single Specialist Committee.4.     Morning SittingsThe recommendation of the Procedure Committee that for an experimental period there should be two morning sittings is on thelines of the evidence which my predecessor gave to them.    There is,however, a significant difference.    The Select Committee propose thatthe adjournment debates should take place at the end of the sitting andnot in the morning.     With this change it is questionable whether therewould be sufficient non-controversial business to occupy the House;and the business that would be taken would be scrappy in the extreme.Two items of business might, therefore, be added to the proposals ofthe Select Committee thus improving the prospects of the experimentbeing successful.HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)
5.     First, while I have sympathy with the Select Committeessopinion that Business and major statements should be made in the afternoon, I believe that there may be a case for introducing anopportunity in the morning for statements of secondary importance.These are now often made the subject of Written Questions merely toavoid intruding on the time of the main business of the day.    Theycould be kept to three or four a day;   supplementary questions wouldbe limited j and forward notice of them would either be given on theOrder Paper or by poster in the Lobby,6.     Second, there has been agitation for more frequent debates on the adjournment &quot;on definite matters of urgent and public importance&quot; under Standing Order No,    9.    The Select Committeeare considering the scarcity of opportunities under the Standing order and will be reporting shortly.    In the meantime, we might considerintroducing, again as a sessional experiment, a new class of topicaldebate.    These would last, say, lj hours.    They would be mountedat short notice and limited to one a week.    Divisions and countswould be barred.    The procedure for raising them would be thesame as for applications under Standing Order No,   9, exceptingthat it would not be essential for them to be raised at the first opportunity,    A Member would have to show that the subject wasdefinite and of public importance, but the element of urgency as nowunderstood would not apply.    K leave were given, the debate wouldtake place on the next available opportunity in the same week,     Durinsuch debates speeches might be limited to 20 minutes for Movers andfrontbench spokesmen and 10 minutes for others.    (This might set the pattern for other limited debates, for example, Prayers, )   Theseoccasions might provide a useful safety valve in those quarters wherethe present criticism of Standing Order No. 9 is strongest.    the speaker, who in his recent evidence to the Select Committee gave afavourable opinion on a proposal of this kind, could reasonably beexpected to avoid repetitious debates.*J8.     The proposal of the Select Committee that the two morningsshould be Wednesdays and Thursdays is unattractive because of serious conflict with meetings of Standing and Ministerial Committeesincluding the Cabinet.    Better choices would be Monday andWednesday or Tuesday and Wednesday.    The advantages of Mondayover Tuesday include avoiding clashes with Committees of the house and the prospect of getting Business cheaply as often happens onFridays now.    The Monday sittings would be confined to non-controversial business recommended by the Select Committee assuitable for the mornings.    Those on &quot;Wednesdays would be widenedto take in the new topical debates.    An experiment of two morningsittings would mean that each week late nights would be relieved by three and a half or five hours, according to whether a topical debatehad been allowed.    Incidentally, I hear that the Opposition are goingto have a free vote on morning sittings.    They say that this, liketelevising the House, is a domestic matter and should be left to members to decide.    However, I am assuming that the government supporters should be whipped, even though about a hundred of ourbackbenchers have signed the Early Day Motion calling for a free vote on procedural changes.
R, H. S, C.Privy Council Office, S. W, 1.11th November, 1966-3-$.     Other mattersThere remain two further recommendations from theCommittee.    First, that an extra quarter of an hour should beprovided for Questions on Mondays to Thursdays inclusivej and second, that Friday sittings should be extended by one hour.    Ipropose that we should deal with them by suggesting  that beforeadopting them we should have an opportunity to judge the effect ofthe other changes.&quot;I 1=0.     Royal Commissions for BillsBlack Rodrs interruptions to summon the Commons to the lords for Commissions to give Royal Assent to Bills have caused considerable irritation.    There have been talks on ways of reducingthe number.    I hope that the Parties will in due course agree thatthere should be  only one of the present type of Commissions for Billsand that this would take place at the end of the Session.    This, Ithink, would be an arrangement welcomed in both Houses.    It may notbe possible to make this amount of progress this Session and we mayhave to be satisfied with an interim arrangement.    A change ofprocedure would almost certainly require a short Bill - a detailed investigation is in hand - and I am assuming that the Bill could been acted with little inroad on Parliamentary time,    I hope to make astatement about this during the procedure debate.Iff.     Changes on financial procedure, the appointment of specialist Committees (at least one if not two) as well as an experimenton morning sittings, and new opportunities for topical debates shouldmake a welcome package,    I should then invite the Select Committeeon Procedure to concentrate on producing as quickly as possible - say a year - a major report on all aspects of procedural reform, and atthe same time excuse them from producing interim reports on specificmatters.    It might, however, be worth considering that the SelectCommittee should have authority to appoint a sub-Committee - whowould report to the main Committee - to deal with any comparatively minor points on which early recommendations, not involving debate in the House, would be particularly useful.
APPEND DCSelect Committee *s RecommendationsRepeal the rule that charges must originate in Committee -Acceptable, but cannot be fully implemented without legislation.Supply days should all be held in the House, sitting as such, andshould include debates on substantive Motions tabled by theOpposition and adjournment debates - Acceptable.    TheGovernment would always be able to amend Opposition Motions.The Chairman of Ways and Means, as Deputy Speaker, should retain his present responsibility for financial matters -Acceptable.The Order Paper should note that Supply business is chosen bythe Opposition - Acceptable.Supply days should not be allocated to specific subjects -Acceptable.A third guillotine (for Winter Supplementary Estimates) shouldbe introduced - Acceptable.    It ensures that the Winter supply is passed in time.Ensure a more even distribution of Supply days - Acceptable,but in practice unnecessary.Members wishing to vote against Estimates &quot;rolled up&quot; in theguillotine should be required to give notice of their intention,in order to permit the unopposed Estimates to be put in onequestion - Acceptable.The guillotine should fall at 10. 00 p. m, and not at 9. 30 p. m. -Acceptable.There should be a standard form of putting the question onMotions to reduce Estimates - An acceptable device to enableamendments to be put without, on the same occasion, passing the Estimates.The third reading stage of Consolidated Fund Bills should beundebatable, and the lost debating time replaced by Supply Days.The second reading debates should be made available entirely for private Members - Acceptable.The Treasury offer to provide more information about under-provision on Service votes should be accepted - Being implemented.A Defence Vote on Account should be introduced which couldreplace the present miscellaneous votes taken on the fourthDefence Supply day.    The form of the defence estimates andthe distribution of defence debates should be further examined -The Secretary of State for Defence has reservations,-4-
14.     Ways and Means Resolutions (including Budget debates) shouldbe taken in the House sitting as such - Acceptable but requireslegislation.15.     There should be a new form of provisional authorisation of taxes, with considered decisions by the House at the endof the Budget debate - Acceptable but requires legislation.16. The practice of bringing in Consolidated Fund Bills and certain other Bills on Ways and Means Resolutions should be ended -Acceptable.17.     Money Resolutions should be taken in the House.    Resolutionsin connection with Bills should be allowed one hour&apos;s debate -Not attractive.    It would sometimes add \ hour to sittings.18.     The Queen&apos;s Recommendation should be signified in writing,and the fact of its signification indicated by means of a note on the Order Paper - Acceptable,    It would be a greatconvenient to senior Ministers,19.     The Committee make no recommendation which might tend to limit the discretion of the Chair in the exercise of the castingvote on taxking proposals - No action.-5-
