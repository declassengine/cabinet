THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government (66) 180 Copy No.     6814th December, 1966CABINETHOME INFORMATION services memorandum by the Prime minister it may be convenient to my colleagues to have a note of thearrangements which I have approved as a result of the cabinets discussion about Home Information Services on 3rd November(CC (66) 54th Conclusions, Minute 3).2. There will be no change in the existing arrangements whereby the Prime Minister^ Press Secretary is responsible forco-ordinating the home information services at official level. at ministerial level, however, the Lord President, in his capacity as leader of the House of Commons, will exercise a general oversightof the public presentation of the Government^ policies as a whole and will be responsible for ensuring that all members of theGovernment are equipped both to reinforce the efforts of departmental Ministers in this respect and to counter public criticismor misinterpretation. This arrangement does not imply the creationof a Minister of Information or a Government spokesman in any formal sense; and it will be without prejudice both to theresponsibility of individual Ministers for presenting their ownDepartmental policies and to the existing arrangements for the ministerial co-ordination, in appropriate cases, of the presentation of inter-related Departmental policies (e.g., in relation to certain aspectsof economic policy).
3. For this purpose the following arrangements will now bemade:(a) All Ministers contemplating policy announcements should give the Lord President sufficient advance notice to enable him to consider whether he wishes to offer any advice on timing, method of presentation, etc. It should be theduty of Ministers&apos; Private Secretaries to ensure that theLord Presidents Office is kept informed in this respect.(b) The Chairmen of all Ministerial Committees should ensurethat, before a Committee concludes the discussion on anyitem on the agenda which is likely to result in a decisionof policy to be announced in the near future, theDepartmental Minister or Ministers concerned arereminded of their responsibility to inform the lord president and to convey to him any views which theCommittee themselves may have about the appropriatepublic presentation of the decision.(c) The Lord President will be responsible for ensuring that all ministers, particularly Junior Ministers, are kept regularlyinformed of forthcoming announcements on government policy about which they are likely to have to speak or to answer questions. For this purpose arrangements willbe made by the Prime Ministers Press Secretary tomaintain a comprehensive forward diary of announce-ments, Ministerial speaking engagements, appearances on television and so forth; and on the basis of this diary theLord President will arrange to obtain from Departments,where necessary, briefs and factual material to be supplied to Ministers for use on such occasions. MinisterialPrivate Offices should give the Lord Presidents Office fullcp-operation in implementing these arrangements.(d) The Lord President will also be responsible for keepingunder continuous review public comment on theGovernments policies, whether in the Press or by
CONFIDENTIAL3broadcast and television; and, if he judges that suchcomment requires a reply, he will advise the minister concerned accordingly.4. In discharging the above duties the Lord Presidents office will maintain close contact with the Press Office at No. 10 which will maintain a corresponding co-ordination with Departmental PressOffices.5. In answer to any inquiry on this subject it should suffice tosay that, as part of his responsibility for the management ofGovernment business in the House of Commons, the Lord Presidentexercises a general oversight of the public presentation of theGovernments policies as a whole. If so, however, it will be necessaryto make it clear that this does not derogate from the responsibilityof individual Ministers for presenting and defending their ownDepartmental policies and, in particular, that it does not imply thecreation of anything resembling a Ministry of Information.H. W.10 Downing Street, S.W.1,13th December, 1966.
