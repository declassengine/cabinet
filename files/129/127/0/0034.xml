DRAFT WHITE PAPERHELP TOWARDS HOME OWNERSHIP&quot;    PART IOption Mortgages1. The White Paper of November 1965 &quot;The Housing Programme1965-1970&quot;  (Cmndo2838) envisaged the &quot;stimulation of the planned growth of owner-occupation by financial measures designed to widen its economic basis;&apos;.    This paper describes the Government&apos;s proposals to do this.    These proposals havebeen worked out in co-operation with the Building Societies andother lending agencies and the necessary legislative provision is contained in Part II of the Housing Subsidies Bill.    Thiswill apply throughout Great Britain.The Scheme2. House purchasers who pay income tax and have a mort-gage get relief from tax on the mortgage interest paid.    Therelief is directly related to the rate of tax paid,, so that people who pay at the standard rate of 8/3d in the  , getgreater relief than those who pay at no more than the lower rates of 6/-d and in the  ;    while those who pay no taxC1)get no relief at all.    v   &apos;    The scheme, which is designed tohelp those in the lower income groups, provides for a new.  type of loan - an option mortgage - at a reduced rate ofinterest as described later in this paper.    House purchaserswill be free to choose an option mortgage with a reduced rateof interest but without tax relief or an ordinary mortgage atnormal rates of interest and with tax relief.    Option mortgages/will;Out of some       million people buying houses with a mortgage,it is estimated that f of a million pay tax at a maximum rateof 6/-d in the  ;    5 of a million at a maximum rate of L/-d inthe  s and another i million pay no tax at all.
will be available not only to people who takeout home loans after the scheme is in force but also to people who already had such home loans before the beginningof the scheme.    So the entering into house purchasing andmortgage arrangements in the meantime will not debar anyonefrom the benefits of an option mortgage.3. Generally mortgage arrangements provide for payments by the borrower of an annuity, i.e. equal   instalmentsof principal and interest combined over the life of the mortgage.    The scheme will apply not only to mortgage arrange-ments of this kind but also to certain other forms of mortgageas indicated later in this paper.    The operation of the mortgage option scheme, however, may be best illustrated by reference to the annuity type of  mortgage.U. As applied to an annuity mortgage,  the subsidy paidto the Building Society or other lender on the borrower&apos;behalf will take the form of 2% interest on the capital out-standing.    The borrower&apos;s repayments of principal and interest will be calculated at a rate of interest 2% less thanthe full rate chargeable on the mortgage for the time being(though not so as to reduce the interest charged below       .For example, if the rate of interest on the mortgage isthe borrower&apos;s repayments will be calculated as though therate were5. One result of these methods of determining the subsidyand the repayments under the mortgage is that the amount ofthe subsidy payable to the lending institution in the early years of a loan will be somewhat greater than the sum by whichthe borrower&apos;s repayments themselves are reduced.    The extramoney so provided by the Government will be applied to the borrower&apos;s account in a more rapid reduction in the outstanding/ capital
capital debt.    Pew mortgages run to full term and the borrowerwill get the benefit of accelerated repayments at the time ofredemption because his debt will be less than it would other-wise have been.6.   Tfcte operation of the scheme is illustrated by the examples and table attached to this paper. The following exemplificationrelates to a  1,000 mortgage, a mortgage period of 25 years., andan interest rate of 6f%.    Under the existing system the annuitypayment by the borrower would be  83. 17. 9d a year:  a personnot liable to income tax would pay this amount and could ofcourse obtain no tax relief: persons paying tax at h/-d in the  only would obtain tax reliefs which would result in a net costto him ranging from  73.  7.  9d in the first year to  83.  1. 3din the last year:    for a person liable for tax in the 6/-d range,the net cost allowing for tax relief would range from  68. 2. 9dto  82.  13. 0.    With an option mortgage the cost would be 69. 3. 9d every year;  in addition his remaining debt willevery year be less than under an ordinary mortgage. Thus for theman paying no tax, or tax at h/-d in the  , outgoings will always be less than at present.    For a man paying tax at 6/-d in the  the payments under an option mortgage will be slightly greaterinitially than the net cost of an ordinary mortgage, but willvery soon be less;    and,  talcing account of the subsidy creditedin repaying his capital debt, the overall benefit will be morethan at present ( 20 as compared with  15 in the first year - seethe table).    For persons paying income tax at the, standard rate,the option mortgage scheme has no advantage over tax relief, andis not intended to benefit them.7. In some cases where a borrower chooses to convert an/existing
- k -existing conventional mortgage into an option mortgage, theposition is more complicated.    Where existing mortgages havebeen running for some years and where the borrower has, ascommonly happens, preferred to meet increasing interest charges by varying the period of the mortgage rather thanthe amount of his annuity payments, these annuity repaymentsbear no fixed relation to current rates of interest.    Indeedextremely complicated calculations would be needed to ascer-tain just what the relationship may be. When,  in thesecircumstances, a person who already has a mortgage chooses to change to an option mortgage,  the scheme will provide for areduction in annual repayments of one-sixth.    Sample calcula-tions have shown that this provides results roughly comparable with those which would be produced by meticulous recalculationof repayments.    Any disparity will be corrected by smallchanges in the duration of the mortgage period, with slightlengthening of short periods, and slight shortening of long-ones.    Such borrowers will,  if they wish, be able instead of reducing their current payments to keep them the same and use the subsidy to pay off their debt more quickly.Fixed.instalment mortgagessome mortgages are repaid by equal instalments of capitaltogether with the interest due on the outstanding debt fromtime to time.    The interest and therefore the total paymentis accordingly progressively reduced as the capital isrepaid.    In these cases the interest due at each payment willbe calculated at a rate 2 per cent less than that providedfor under the mortgage and the difference will be paid tothe lending agency by the Government.    This will apply to both existing and new borrowers.8.Instead of being repaid by equal periodical repayments- h -
9. .       Where mortgages are repaid at the end of the termfixed by a single lump sum, normally provided by a policy ofendowment assurance, the interest is not reduced annuallybut is calculated on the whole sum borrowed throughout theperiod of the loan.    Because of their different nature thescheme cannot apply to this type of mortgage exactly as toannuity mortgages.    In such cases the subsidy will be at separately of 1%% which will provide roughly equivalent treatment between annuity and these mortgages.    Subsidy will only bepaid on mortgage interest;    the premiums paid for theendowment assurance policy and the income tax relief whichthey attract will not be affected.    Subsidy will not reducethe mortgage interest below h\% to correspond with the U%lower limit for annuity mortgages.Mixed mortgages10. There are some mortgages in which part of the capitalis repaid with interest by equal periodical payments on anannuity basis while the remainder is repaid at the end of the mortgage by an endowment assurance and interest only is paiduntil then. These will be treated in effect as two seperatemortgages, the first part attracting a subsidy of 2% and theremainder the subsidy of 1%% applicable to endowment mortgagesTenant purchase schemesll.       Some local authorities sell their houses by instal-ments1 With interest on the outstanding capital.    Under these arrangements the ownership of the property does not pass untilthe last instalment has been paid.    The scheme will apply tothese transactions as if the purchaser had borrowed thepurchase price from the authority on the security of the house
Imp r o v em en t s12. -     The scheme will apply to mortgage loans for improve-ments to owner-occupied houses.How subsidy will &quot;be paid %13.       Borrowers will not have to claim subsidy. Once theyhave chosen an option mortgage,  subsidy benefit will be credited to them by the lender.  The precise methsd and timing of payments by the Exchequer to the lending agencies will belaid down in directions to be given by the three Housing Ministers afterconsultation with the lenders or their representative bodies and with the approval of the Treasury.    The method of creditingthe borrower with the subsidy will be laid down in schemes tobe made by the Ministers.  Before making a scheme,  theymust consult with the qualifying lenders or their representa-tive bodies.    Different schemes may be made for differentcases or classes of case.Making the choice of an option mortgagelh.       Every mortgagor will have one irrevocable choice betweenpresent tax relief arrangements and the new mortgage optionscheme.    However,  if the mortgage should pass to some other person, for example upon the-death of the original borrower,the person who takes over the mortgage will be able to decidewithin three months, whether to choose an option mortgage ortax relief.15.       Borrowers who have a mortgage before 1st September 1967must in general make their choice before 31st December 1967.There will be some exceptions.    Some building societies&apos;financial years end at the end of September, October orNovember.    Borrowers from these societies will,  in order tomake possible the large number of recalculation of payments,have to make their choice before the end of the society1s/financial
financial year. Some people will have applied for a loan before 1st September 1967 but will not have received it by that date.They will have to opt by the dates given above or by the date when the loan commences, whichever is the later.16.       Borrowers seeking a loan on or after 1st September 1967 will normally have to make their choice when applying for a loansince this choice may affect the amount of the loan which thelending society will be prepared to make. They will have.toformally sign the option by the time the loan is made.Whenjthje^sjihgme. will operate17.       Only rough estimates can be made of the number ofmortgagors who may opt but the number could well be very large.There are many varieties of mortgage;    consequently explanation of the scheme to individual borrowers (who will often wantadvice) and the adjustment of the accounts for those who optwill be a formidable task for- the lending agencies.    A heavy burden will fall upon Inland Revenue.    For these reasons itwill not be practicable to make the scheme fully operativeuntil the 1st April 1968 and subsidy and adjusted payments under mortgage options will run from then.Co-ownership Housing Associactions18.       The subsidy will be available to co-ownership housing associations which have been approved for the purposes of S.I4.3of the Finance Act 1963.    These associations are corporations in which the members own co-operatively the houses which theyoccupy and the individual co-owners are treated for tax purposes in substantially the same way as owner-occupiers.19.&apos;       There are at present few such associations. However,the application of the scheme to them presents some difficultiesbecause the association, whose acts are those of the memberscollectively,  is the sole mortgagor, but the advantages ofopting will depend on the individual circumstances of each- 7 - /member.
member.    The Bill empowers the Ministers to make regulations for applying the subsidy provisions to these associations withsuch modifications and adaptations as they consider necessary.The intention is to secure that if the association as a bodyopt, their members will benefit by subsidy under the Bill.Limits on the schemeBorrowers20.       The- subsidy is intended for people borrowing to providea house for their own occupation and consequently no personwill normally be able to have more than one option mortgageat any one time.    There are some occasions however, when aperson may wish to help a member of his immediate family by taking out a mortgage on a house for the latter&apos;s occupation.An exception will be made enabling an option mortgage to beobtained in these circumstances.Lenders21.        The Building Societies Association,  the Life OfficeAssociation, the local authorities associations and the friendly societies have all agreed to recommend to their members that they should co-operate and join in the scheme.The scheme will apply to loans made by lenders who areprescribed by Ministerial order.  It will include the mainlending agencies,  i.e. building societies, insurance companies,local authorities, friendly societies, new town corporations and for loans to housing societies the Housing corporation and the Housing Ministers.    The ministers will have to consult the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies beforeprescribing a building society or a friendly society andthe Board of Trade before prescribing an insurance company.22.       People will be told in due course when and how toapply for option mortgages./ PART II
PART IIGuarantees for mortgages up to 100% of valuation23.       Some people who would otherwise be able to afford to buy a house on mortgage have difficulty in finding thecapital needed for a deposit.    Some local authorities areprepared to lend up to 100% of their valuation of a propertybut other lending institutions will rarely do so.    Building-societies have, however, well tried arrangements under whichthey will advance more than the sum which they would lend uponthe security of the property alone where the excess advanceis guaranteed by a policy of insurance to secure them againstloss.    The premium is commonly added to the mortgage debt.The Government consider that this well tested scheme can provide the basis for arrangements for the wider granting ofmortgages of up to 100% of valuation for persons of modestmeans who take an option mortgage.24.       Representatives of the British Insurance association and the Building Societies Association have agreed, to co-operate with the Government in a system for guaranteeing suchmortgages in suitable cases.    Broadly where lending agenciesare willing to make loans above the amount which they would normally advance without collateral security the minister would join with insurance companies in guaranteeing the excess up to 100% of valuation.    The risk of loss would be shared  &quot;between the Government and the insurance    - -company.    The borrower would pay a premium to meet that part of the risk which would be borne by the company, but no charge would be made for that part of the risk carried bythe Government.25.       While the option mortgage scheme will be operativeas soon as is practicable,  the Government haye decided/that the- i. &quot;  9 - .
\that the introduction of the guarantee scheme will have to be deferred until economic conditions are more favourable.    TheBuilding Societies Association and the British InsuranceAssociation have for their part said that they agree that itwould not be appropriate to introduce the scheme at thepresent time.    Opportunity is being taken to provide thepowers needed in the Housing Subsidies Bill but the scheme will not come into operation until a later date which will befixed by the Minister.    In the meantime, discussions will beheld with the bodies concerned to determine the precisedetails of the scheme so that it will be fully worked out and ready to be put into operation as soon as this becomes possible.
