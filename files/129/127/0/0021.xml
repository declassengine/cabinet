The Chairman said that the Commission had greatly valued the informal discussions they had already had with certain Ministers, whichthey regarded as complementing departmental evidence.    MostMinisters had wide experience outside their immediate departmental responsibilities and were able to help the Commission to make a realistic assessment.    Nevertheless, he and his colleagues would fullyunderstand if Ministers, individually or collectively, felt that no further consultation of this kind with Ministers should take place.    As agreed at Cabinet on 20th October (CC(66) 51st Conclusions, Minute 2) I explained to him the objections to such consultations between Ministers and theCommission.    I added that I did not myself expect to appear beforethe Commission and that I did not expect other Ministers would wish todo so  but I hoped to continue my personal contacts with him.A.G.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.
