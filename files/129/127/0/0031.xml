SECRETRHODESIAPROPOSALS FOR A SETTLEMENT-1966The six principles the approach of successive British Governments towards the problemof granting independence to Rhodesia has throughout been governed by certain basic requirements. These have been formulated as five principles,to which the present Government subsequently added a sixth. These areas follows:  (1) The principle and intention of unimpeded progress to majority rule,already enshrined in the 1961 Constitution, would have to be maintained and guaranteed.(2) There would also have to be guarantees against retrogressiveamendment of the Constitution.(3) There would have to be immediate improvement in the politicalstatus of the African population.(4) There would have to be progress towards ending racial discrimination.(5) The British Government would need to be satisfied that any basisproposed for independence was acceptable to the people of Rhodesia asa whole.(6) It would be necessary to ensure that, regardless of race, there wasno oppression of majority by minority or of minority by majority.Historical background. The present Constitution of the Colony of Southern Rhodesia is thatgranted by Order in Council in 1961. This introduced a number of importantmodifications in Rhodesia&apos;s position as a self-governing dependency, but itwas not framed nor intended as an independence Constitution. The grantof independence can constitutionally only be made by Parliament at westminster. In the course of negotiations in 1963-64, the then BritishGovernment made plain to the Rhodesian Government that certain conditions must be met before independence could be granted in particular, theexistence of sufficiently representative institutions: and, on the rhodesian government^ claim for the grant of independence on the basis of the 1961Constitution, they insisted that, the British Government must be satisfiedthat any basis on which independence was proposed was acceptable to thepeople of the country as a whole. The negotiations subsequently undertaken by the present British Government explored in great detail the possible formof an independence settlement within the five principles. In the discussions in London and later in Salisbury in October 1965, Mr. Smith accepted these principles as a basis for discussion: but because he was not prepared to implement them effectively, no agreement for the grant of independence was found possible. (The relevant documents and correspondence have alreadybeen published.in Cmnd. 2807.)3.   On 11 Ndyember, 1965, Mr. Smith&apos;s Government purported, on itsown authority, to declare independence.  As had been made clear in advanceSECRET7335 a 2
by the British Government, an act of this kind was illegal and unconstitutionaland could not be regarded as valid. Accordingly, The Queen, through theGovernor, dismissed the Rhodesian Ministers and the Governor has sinceremained the focus of constitutional authority in Rhodesia.4. The British Government declared their intention of ending the rebellion as soon as possible and to this end imposed sanctions against rhodesia in which, in accordance with the authority of resolutions passed in the Security Council, they had the support of the vast majority of tradingnations in the world.5. The British Government made it clear that they would be willing tonegotiate a constitutional settlement only with a legally constitutedGovernment in Rhodesia. When in April of this year the Governorforwarded, with his support, a suggestion from Mr. Smith that there shouldbe informal exploratory talks to see whether a basis for a solutionexisted, the British Government thought it right to authorise officials intheir service to take up this offer. Talks at official level were accordinglyheld first in London and subsequently in Salisbury between May and august. The understanding in these talks was that they were entirelyexploratory and without commitment. The ground was fully explored andpositions clarified: but no basis for a solution emerged.6. At the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting in London inSeptember the British Government notified to the Conference their decisions as regards a settlement of the Rhodesian problem, and stated that they proposed to communicate their intentions through&apos;&apos;&apos;the Governor to all sections of opinion in Rhodesia, and to inform the illegal regime that, ifthey were not prepared to take the initial and indispensable steps whereby the rebellion was brought to an end and executive authority was vested inthe Governor, certain related consequences would ensue. These are setout in paragraph 10 of the section of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos;communique relating to Rhodesia, which is reproduced at Appendix A.7. Accordingly the Commonwealth Secretary visited Salisbury from13 to 28 September for the purposes explained in the communique. Duringthe course of his \visit, under the aegis of the Governor he met across-section of representatives of opinion in the country, including mr.. Smith and members of the regime. In these talks, he made clear theBritish Governments requirements for a settlement of the Rhodesianproblem, and what the consequences of rejection of the British proposals would be. Mr. Smith put forward the views of his regime on the form ofa settlement and how it might be reached: and a document was exchangedin which the respective positions were set out in parallel in the words ofeach side.   This is contained in Appendix B.8. Subsequently, in the light of these discussions, the BritishGovernment drew up a considered statement of their terms for a settlement and this was communicated to Mr. Smith by Sir Morrice James, DeputyUnder-Secretary of State, Commonwealth Office, on 15 October. The text of this is contained in Appendix C.9. Mr. Smith&apos;s reply was forwarded to Mr. Hennings, the Head of theBritish Residual Staff in Salisbury, on 4 November and is contained inAppendix D.4
The British GoYcrmncnfs objectives10. Throughout the constitutional discussions before the illegaldeclaration of independence on the 11 November, 1965, and the exploratorytalks which have taken place since that event, the British Government have sought a solution which would be fair to Europeans and Africans alike in rhodesia, which would win the acceptance of the people of Rhodesia as awhole, which could be commended to the British people and Parliament asa just and honourable settlement, and which would be calculated to establishRhodesia as an independent State with the general goodwill of the world community.The implementation of the principles11. The British Government have, quite exceptionally and in theparticular circumstances of Rhodesia, been prepared to consider the grantof independence to Rhodesia before majority rule had been reached. Butthey have made it plain that, if this were to happen, certain essential conditions must be met.  The most important of these are as follows:A. Any Independence Constitution on this basis must firmly establish an open road, which could not be blocked or impeded, for Africanpolitical advancement to majority rule within a reasonable period ofyears.B. The essential parts of the Constitution must be protected by the moststringent possible safeguards to prevent changes which could stopor impede this advancement.C. Any Independence Constitution on these lines must be demonstratedby appropriate democratic means to be acceptable to the people of rhodesia as a whole.12. They have also said that the Independence Constitution should provide some immediate improvement in the political status of Africans, andthat there must be progress towards ending racial discrimination.13. On Mr. Smiths insistence, the discussions have centred round thepossibility of amending and safeguarding the 1961 Constitution to meet theseessential conditions. There has never on his side been any disposition to contemplate a new constitutional approach which the British Governmenthave always been ready to consider if it appeared to offer a more hopefulpath to a solution.A.   Unimpeded progress to majority rule14. The 1961 Constitution provides 50 seats in the Legislature on anon-racial franchise for which certain qualifications arc laid down (the &quot; A &quot;Roll). The qualifications mean that the voters for these seats are at presentpredominantly European. But given a genuine effort on the part of Africansand Europeans to make this Constitution work in spirit and in practice, thenumber of African voters could steadily increase in a way calculated to bringmajority rule about within a reasonable period from the point of view oflegitimate African aspirations, and in a way that would preserve good government and stability in the country and safeguard its social and economic development within the concept of a  non-racial society.   The British5
SECRETGovernment have repeatedly said that majority rule could not come aboutimmediately but should be reached through merit and achievement.15. The 1961 Constitution also provides a starting point for Africanadvancement by providing 15 additional seats in the Legislature on a franchisewith lower qualifications (the &quot; B&quot; Roll). The voters on this role arepredominantly African. In addition there is a system of cross-voting which enables &quot;B&quot; Roll voters to exercise some in flu .-ce on &quot;A&quot; Roll elections(and &quot; A &quot; Roll voters on &quot; B &quot; Roll elections). Under this system, &quot; B &quot;Roll votes are allowed to count in an &quot;A&quot; Roll constituency up to a quarter of the total &quot; A &quot; Roll votes cast in that constituency.16. In all the detailed discussion of possible constitutional arrangements which has taken place over the past two years, agreement on a settlementhas been made impossible by Mr. Smith&apos;s-adamant insistence on two points:(i) that the European minority in Rhodesia should retain a constitutionalpower to control the pace of African advancement; and(ii) that the road to majority rule, as established in the 1961 constitution as it stood, should in effect be lengthened in the IndependenceConstitution.17. On the first point, Mr. Smith has consistently refused to entrenchthe whole of Chapter III of the 1961 Constitution, which among other thingsfixes the respective number of &quot; A &quot; Roll and &quot; B &quot; Roll seats. That is, hedeclines to make these provisions subject to the special procedures requiredfor amendment of vital areas of the Constitution. The effect of this wouldbe to leave the Rhodesian Legislature as at present constituted (and hence the European minority) with the power arbitrarily to increase the numberof &quot; A &quot; Roll constituencies, which could be done simply by exercising thetwo-thirds majority vote which the Europeans already, control (see paragraph20 below). This power could clearly be used arbitrarily to retard the pace ofadvancement to majority rule. Indeed Mr. Smith has said that he regardsthis as &quot; a safeguard against the premature advent of African rule &quot;.18.- On the second point, Mr. Smith has consistently sought to abolish the cross-voting system, and thus to eliminate the influence which the&quot;B&quot; Roll voters can, under the 1961 Constitution, already exercise on&quot; A &quot; Roll elections. Another way in which he has sought to lengthen theroad to majority rule has been by proposing, originally, to &quot; fade-out&quot; the&quot; B &quot; Roll seats as Africans secured &quot; A &quot; Roll seats, and now in his latest proposals to &quot;phase-in&quot; 15 European reserved seats (in addition to the50 &quot; A&quot; Roll seats) as Africans secured &quot; A &quot; Roll seats. While the BritishGovernment have been prepared to consider provision, for European reservedseats at a later stage of political progress, they could not accept their introduction in a way which would affect and is clearly intended to affect the length of the road towards majority rule as compared with the existing provisions of the 1961 Constitution.19. To accept Mr. Smith*s position on these matters would thereforebe incompatible with the principles that progress to majority rule should beunimpeded and that there should be an immediate improvement in thepolitical status of the Africans.6
B. Safeguarding the Constitution20. The 1961 Constitution provides for amendment of ordinary sectionsof the Constitution by a two-thirds majority vote of the RhodesianLegislature, and of specially entrenched provisions (i.e., the vital areas ofthe Constitution) by such a vote followed by either a referendum of the fourmain racial groups in Rhodesia voting separately, or alternatively the queen&apos;s approval given on the advice of United Kingdom Ministers.21. The 1961 Constitution was not an Independence Constitution andthese provisions for amendment of specially entrenched clauses would hotbe appropriate to such a Constitution. The British Government has insisted,however, that they must be replaced by provisions providing equivalentsafeguards against retrogressive amendment. They have sought to do thisby suggesting: ,&apos;(i) an effective domestic &quot; blocking mechanism &quot; which, until majority rule is achieved, would ensure that consent to any amendment wassecured from a broad consensus of the people of Rhodesia as a whole,of both minority and majority races: and(ii) a system of appeal whereby any amendment which discriminatedunjustly between the races or contravened human rights could be challenged. - -   \ &apos; &apos;22. On (i), the British Government have expressed their willingness tointroduce a Senate of 12 Europeans and 12 Africans. This would votetogether with the Lower House on any proposal to amend the specially entrenched clauses, and such amendment would require a three-quartersmajority of the combined Houses. They have said that at least nine of the africans in the Senate should be democratically elected, and have also proposed that the number of &quot; B &quot; Roll seats in the Lower House shouldbe increased from \-$ to 17. These proposals would give the Africans an effective blocking,quarter and could therefore ensure that no retrogressiveamendments could be made. &apos;23. On (ii) the British Government have proposed that appeals shouldlie to a &quot; Constitutional Commission &quot; in Rhodesia, consisting of the chief justice and other judges, with further appeal as of right to the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council.24. On these two proposals, Mr. Smith insists that at least six of the12 Africans in the Senate should be Chiefs elected by an electoral college of Chiefs; and rejects any increase in the &quot; B&quot; Roll seats in the lower house. Pie is &quot; prepared to consider&quot; an appeal to a constitutional commission in Rhodesia, though he would wish the grounds of appeal tobe more narrowly defined than in the British proposals; but he rejects theidea of a further appeal to the Privy Council.25.   Mr. SmiuYs proposals do not constitute effective safeguards againstretrogressive amendment of the Constitution.C. The testing of Rhodesian opinion and return to legality26. The British Government, like their predecessors in office, have throughout maintained that, if a settlement were to be reached on a basisifll; - &apos;iji      -.7 :        l      1  &apos;&apos;&apos;,-!&apos;
not of majority rule as a condition precedent to independence but ofunimpeded progress towards majority rule, it must be unmistakably clearthat the people of Rhodesia as a whole wanted independence on this basis.There would be no independence before majority rule if the people of rhodesia as a whole were shown to be opposed to it; and no question of inviting the British Parliament to legislate for independence unless it were clear that the proposed Constitution was acceptable to the people of rhodesia as a whole.27. There can be a fair test of opinion only under a constitutional government, with censorship lifted, individuals who have been detained on political grounds released, and normal political activities permitted provided they are conducted peacefully and democratically. For this reason, a returnto legality must precede the testing of opinion.28. In order to bring about a return to legality, they have proposed theappointment by the Governor of a broadly-based interim administration.This would be a Rhodesian Government of national unity. It would clearly be inappropriate for it to be responsible to the present Rhodesian Legislature,which would have to be in abeyance. Members of the interim governmentwould be responsible to the Governor who would normally act on their advice in all internal matters of administration. The armed forces and thepolice, however, would come under the direct responsibility of the Governor,who would retain powers in his discretion not only to deal with domesticdisturbances and illegality, but also to prevent a repetition of unconstitutionalaction and to protect human rights. If during the interim period theGovernor needed military assistance for these purposes, the BritishGovernment reserved the right to provide it. Also, in order to provideassurance after independence to both the minority and the majority raceand thus give expression to the sixth principle,, the British Governmentreserved the right to provide similar assistance if this were necessary asa further guarantee of the agreed Constitution.29. The course put before Mr. Smith and his regime was therefore quite clear. If they were willing to reach an informal agreement with the BritishGovernment on a constitutional settlement based on the stated terms and principles, the British Government would be ready to stand by that agreement as a basis for negotiation with a broadly-based, legal interim government representing the various races in Rhodesia, and as a basis onwhich the wishes of the people of the country as a whole would be ascertained.30. Mr. Smith, however, in his reply, passed over in complete silence theBritish Governments proposals for a return to constitutional government,while appearing to insist that the testing of opinion must be carried out under the present illegal regime and before there could be any discussion of restoring legality. He made no comment or undertaking on the removal of censorship or the position of political detainees. ..      .....31. The reply was unsatisfactory in other respects, e.g., Mr. Smithshowed no disposition to recognise that any move at all was necessary asregards racial discrimination and land apportionment.8
SECRET - 233The three fundamental issues32. In this situation, the British Government on the 11 Novemberaddressed to Mr. Smith, through their representative in Salisbury, threeelucidatory questions on the essential issues of principle on which their decision clearly turned, as follows:- Question 1In declining to entrench the whole of Chapter III of the 1961Constitution, does Mr. Smith wish, as he told the Secretary of State for commonwealth Affairs, to maintain the position that the rhodesian government of the day should retain the right to control the pace of ^African advancement?Question 2Does Mr. Smith reject the proposals (in paragraphs 13-17 of theBritish Governments statement of terms for a settlement) for abroad-based interim administration representative of all races as themeans of returning to legality?Question 3Does Mr. Smith maintain that the testing of opinion under principlefive must take place before there has been a return to constitutional government in Rhodesia and before censorship has been lifted and politicaldetainees have been released, as proposed in paragraph 11 of the Britishterms?Mr. Smith&apos;s reply to these questions was received on the 17 November andis at Appendix E.33. - Mr. Smith in his reply seeks to deny that his. motive in declining toentrench the whole ,of Chapter III of the 1961 Constitution is to give the rhodesian Government of the day the right to control the pace of Africanadvancement, despite what he said in his earlier statement of position(Appendix B) aboutX&apos; safeguards against the premature advent of Africanrule &quot;. But, whatever the^ motive, Mr. Smith&apos;s proposals would in fact leave a braking mechanism in the^hands of the European minority, because theGovernment of the day could at any time create as many extra &quot; A &quot; Roll seats as they wanted. If the provisions in the Constitution relating to thenumber of &quot; A &quot; Roll constituencies were not specially entrenched, this wouldbe the effect whatever provisions were made elsewhere in the Constitution.34. On the question of restoration of constitutional government,Mr. Smith declines to discuss the matter until a constitutional settlement hasbeen reached, has passed the test of acceptability, and has been finallyendorsed by the British Government.35. In saying this, he answers the third question also, since it is clearthat he is insisting on the test of acceptability being carried out before therehas been a return to constitutional government. But he then seeks to cloudthe issue by putting a counter-question to the British Government. Thatcounter-question is in effect whether the British Government would undertake9
in advance to impose a constitutional settlement even though the people of rhodesia as a whole had manifestly rejected it. There is only one answerwhich any British Government could give to this question. Nor isMr. Smith&apos;s implication valid that, if the result of the lest was unfavourable to the constitutional settlement proposed, Rhodesia would under the british governments proposals be left without a Constitution. There would be a legal interim government, under the 1961 Constitution appropriately modified,with whom further negotiations could in that event be undertaken.36. Finally, Mr. Smith indicates no more than a readiness to &quot; modify &quot;censorship while the testing of opinion is taking place. He denies there are any purely political detainees, and gives no undertaking beyond thepossibility of those in detention making their views known to the testingauthority.37.   [Paragraph to be added.]Conclusions38. The British Government have carefully weighed the position which mr. Smith continues to present, in the light of the thorough and repetitiveexploration of all these problems which has taken place since last May.On the three vital issues:(i) Mr. SmiuYs proposals would leave in the hands of the Europeanminority a mechanism whereby progress to majority rule could beimpeded. The British Government could not possibly justifyrecommending to Parliament the grant of independence in circumstances where the minority could arbitrarily delay the progress to majority rule.(ii) Mr. Smith has not accepted the British Governmenfs proposals fora broad-based Rhodesian Administration to be formed by theGovernor and to be representative of all races, as a means of.returning to legality. He insists that this is a matter for discussiononly when a constitutional settlement has been agreed and has passed the test of acceptability. The British Government cannot negotiate a constitutional settlement with an illegal regime and must satisfyitself that any new legal administration is broadly representative ofthe people as a whole.(iii). Mr. Smith insists that the testing of opinion under the fifth principlemust take place before there has been a return to constitutional government. He evades any firm undertaking about the removalof censorship and is not prepared to release political detainees evenagainst an undertaking that their political activities will be conductedpeacefully and democratically. He has not accepted the BritishGovernmenfs proposal for a Royal Commission as the means oftesting opinion. The British Government cannot agree that a fair and free test could take place under the auspices of the illegal regime, and in the circumstances contemplated by Mr. Smith: and10
no test held under such circumstances of virtual duress could hope to be recognised as valid by public opinion generally in theUnited Kingdom or in the world at large.39. For these reasons, the British Government have been forced to conclude that the regime are not ready to contemplate any constitutional settlement which would ensure uninterrupted progress to majority rulewithin a reasonable period of time: that they are not prepared to acceptwhat must be the minimal requirements if the opinion of the people of rhodesia as a whole is to be properly ascertained: and that they are notprepared to take the necessary steps whereby the rebellion is brought to anend. The related consequences,&quot; as set out in the final communique of the^-Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting in London (see paragraph 10 of appendix A) will therefore ensue.//11SECRET
APPENDIX AEXTRACT FROM THE FINAL COMMUNIQUE OF THECOMMONWEALTH PRIME MINISTERS&apos; MEETING IN LONDON1966 (Cmnd. 3115)RhodesiaI. The Commonwealth Conference devoted a major portion of itsdiscussions to the problem of Rhodesia.2. As at Lagos, in January of this year, the members of the Conferencereaffirmed that the authority and responsibility for guiding Rhodesia to independence rested with Britain but they acknowledged that the problem was of wider concern to Africa, the Commonwealth and the world.3. They reaffirmed the view expressed in the communique issued at theend of the Lagos Conference as follows:&quot; The Prime Ministers declared that any political system based onracial discrimination was intolerable. It diminished the freedom alike ofthose who imposed it and of those who suffered under it. they considered that the imposition of discriminatory conditions of political,social, economic and educational nature upon the majority by anyminority for the benefit of a privileged few was an outrageous violation of the fundamental principles of human rights. The goal of futureprogress in Rhodesia should be the establishment of a just society basedon equality of opportunity to which all sections of the community couldcontribute their full potential and from which all could enjoy the benefitsdue to them without discrimination or unjust impediment. To this endseveral principles were affirmed. The first was the determination of allpresent that the rebellion must be brought to an end. All those detained for purely political reasons should be released. Political activities shouldbe constitutional and free from intimidation from any quarter. Repressiveand discriminatory laws should be repealed.&quot;4.   They further reaffirmed  the  statement made in  their  LondonCommunique of 1965 and repeated in Lagos that &quot;the principle of one &apos;man one vote was regarded as the very basis of democracy and this shouldbe applied in Rhodesia &quot;.5. They remain unanimous on the objective that the rebellion in rhodesia must be brought to an end speedily. In order to achieve this objective, most of the Heads of Government expressed their firm opinion* that force was the only sure means of bringing down&apos; the illegal: regime in rhodesia. Others, however, shared the British Governments objections tothe use of force to impose a constitutional settlement, while agreeing that itwas not ruled out where necessary to restore law and order.12
6. Most Heads of Government urged that Britain should make acategorical declaration that independence would not be granted before majority rule is established on the basis of universal adult franchise and thatthis declaration should not be conditional on whether the illegal regimeagreed to surrender or not. They further urged that Britain should refuse to resume discussions or to negotiate with the illegal regime.7. The British Prime Minister stated that the British Government wouldnot recommend to the British Parliament any constitutional settlement which did not conform with the six principles; that they attached particular importance to the fifth principle, namely that any settlement must be, andbe seen to be, acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole; that they regarded it as implicit in this fifth principle that the test of acceptabilitymust enable the people of Rhodesia as a whole to indicate whether or not they were prepared to accept any settlement which provided for the grant of independence before majority rule was achieved; and that there would be no:independence before majority rule if the people of Rhodesia as a whole were shown to be opposed to it.8. The Conference noted the following decisions . of the BritishGovernment: I(a) After the illegal regime is ended a legal, government will beappointed by the Governor and will constitute a broadly basedrepresentative administration. During this interim period the armed forces and police will be responsible to the Governor. Thoseindividuals who are detained or restricted on political grounds will be released and normal political activities will be permitted provided thatthey are conducted peacefully and democratically without intimidation. from any quarter;.. .     / i(b) The British Government will negotiate, with this interim administration,a constitutional settlement directed to achieving the objective of majority rulo^on the basis of the six principles;(c) This constitutional settlement will be submitted for acceptance to thepeople of Rhodesia^s^a whole by appropriate democratic means;(d) The British Parliament and Government must be satisfied that thistest of opinion is fair and free and would be acceptable to the generalworld community;(e) The British Government will not consent to independence before majority rule unless the people of Rhodesia as a whole are shown tobe in favour of it.9. Most Heads of Government made it clear that in their view political leaders and others detained should be immediately and unconditionallyreleased before an interim representative Government was formed, in whichthey should be adequately represented. They further expressed the viewthat any ascertainment of the wishes of the people of Rhodesia as a wholeshould be by a Referendum based on Universal Adult Suffrage, i.e., one man,one vote.13
10. The Heads of Government also noted that the British government proposed immediately^ to communicate its intentions as indicated abovethrough the Governor to all sections of opinion in Rhodesia and to informthe illegal regime there that if they are not prepared to take the initial andindispensable steps whereby the rebellion is brought to an end and executive authority is vested in the Governor, the following related consequences willensue:  (a) The British Government will withdraw all previous proposals for a constitutional settlement which have been made; in particular theywill not&apos;thereafter be prepared to submit to the British Parliamentany settlement which involves independence before majority rule.(b) Given the full support of Commonwealth representatives at the united nations, the British Government will be prepared to join in sponsoringin the Security Council of the United Nations before the end of thisyear a resolution providing for effective and selective mandatoryeconomic sanctions against Rhodesia.11. The Conference had before it an analysis of the working of economic sanctions prepared by the Sanctions Committee set up in Lagos. It wasagreed that, though sanctions had undoubtedly depressed the Rhodesianeconomy, they were unlikely at their present level to achieve the desiredpolitical objectives within an acceptable period of time. Accordingly, the heads of Government were generally agreed on the need for stronger andmandatory economic sanctions under Chapter VII of the United nations charter. Most were convinced that mandatory sanctions of a general and comprehensive character should be applied under Chapter VII, Articles 41and 42 of the United Nations Charter, and should cover both exports and imports. Others favoured sanctions on selected individual commoditiesimportant to the economy of Rhodesia. The Heads of Government recordedtheir appreciation of the work of the Sanctions Committee and requested it tocontinue its work. &apos;12. There was unanimity of view that Commonwealth countries shouldcontinue to co-operate to the fullest extent possible in the pursuit of the objectives for Rhodesia notwithstanding some differences of opinion as tothe most effective means of achieving them.13. It was also agreed unanimously that assistance should be given to zambia to produce a more complete cut-off of trade with Rhodesia and toassist her to withstand any serious effect on her economy resulting therefrom.To this end they requested that the Zambian Sub-Committee of the SanctionsCommittee should continue its efforts in co-ordinating further Commonwealthassistance. Continuing consideration should also be given to the problemsof Malawi. : -14. The.Heads of Government agreed that the problem of Rhodesiashould be kept under constant review, and that they would meet again soonif the illegal regime were not brought to an end speedily.15. The Heads of Government have had one overriding purpose in their consideration of the Rhodesian situation; a consideration which has now- &apos;  14   .;&apos;.&quot;V/., &apos; &apos;        .   -
extended over four meetings of Commonwealth Prime Ministers. Thatpurpose is to end the perpetuation of power in that country in the handsof a minority, with only ineffective and inadequate guarantees of the political rights of the majority. Such a situation must be replaced by an arrangementbased on a multi-racial society in which human and political rights will be vested in all the people without discrimination and in accordance with the true principles of democracy.&apos;V.!15SECRET
secret appendix statement OF POSITIONSStatement by British government.  Return to Legality(a) Before there can be formal negotia-fion of an independence settlement,there must be a return to legality in rhodesia.(b) This should be accomplished bythe appointment by the governor of a broadly-based representative government ad interim, not neces-sarily confined to political parties and including Africans. The com-position of this government would need to be approved by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment.(c) During this interim period, the armed forces and police to beresponsible to the Governor.(d) Individuals detained or restrictedon political grounds to be released and normal political activitiespermitted, provided they are con-ducted peacefully and democraticallyand without intimidation from any quarter.(e) Special provision to be made forthe protection of the Kariba Dam- installations.(/) Provided there is acceptance inprinciple of a return to legality inthe manner and on the conditionsdescribed above, informal talks willStatement by the regimeA. Restoration of Normal Relations(a) The Rhodesian Government hasnot yet determined its position in this regard and it does not believe thatthe question should be considereduntil the shape of the constitutional settlement has been agreed. How-ever it does recognise that some steps would have to be taken at theappropriate time.(b) This could only be carried outafter the shape of the independencesettlement has been mutuallydetermined and after its acceptabilityto the people of Rhodesia has alsobeen determined and. its. acceptability-to the British Government has been declared and, then finally, after ageneral election has been held.(c) There can be no deviation from the traditional practice that has alwaysexisted in the country.(d) Those individuals who have been detained or restricted have been sodetained or restricted by reason oftheir subversive activities. Theycould only be released if they gave a genuine undertaking to abide bythe law.(e) There is no need for additional or special provision to be made for theprotection - :bf -the Kariba Daminstallations since the protection ofthese is already adequately providedfor by the Rhodesian Government.(/) The talks designed to determine the shape of the constitutional settlement should be pressed forward to a conclusion.   Thereafter consideration16
continue for the purpose of estab-lishing an agreed framework for a constitutional settlement, directed toachieving the objective of majority rule on the basis of the, sixprinciples.(g) If such a framework can be agreed,formal negotiations for independence on that basis will take place with thelegal interim administration.(/z) Sanctions will be lifted as soon asthe new legal government has beeDestablished.B.   The Fifth Principle(a) The constitutional settlement evolvedin informal talks and subsequentlynegotiated with the legal governmentwill be submitted for acceptance tothe people of Rhodesia as a wholeby appropriate democratic means,and the British Government and parliament must be satisfied that thistest of opinion is fair/and free, andacceptable to the/general world community.(6) It would probably^^e decided(though other methods are not finallyexcluded) to set up a Royal&quot; Corn-mission for this purpose, with authority to determine by whatmeans the opinion of the various sections of the community in rhodesia might best be ascertainedand to carry through such ascertain-ment..., The Commission might be entirely British. Of it might &quot;include members drawn from commonwealth countries; or alternatively Common-wealth representatives might be&apos;associated in some way or other withthe processes of ascertainment ofopinion.B.  The^ Fifth Principle(a) It is accepted that the BritishGovernment needs to be assured ofthe acceptability of the constitutional settlement to the people of rhodesia  a whole.-This process&quot; should becompleted in accordance with the steps indicated earlier in A (b) above.1(b) The manner in which the accepta-bility of the constitutional settlement is determined is primarily a matter for the British Government. How-ever, the Rhodesian Governmentwould need to be satisfied about theterms of reference and composition of the determining body and mannerin which it would set about its task.Since this.is. a matter between Britainand Rhodesia it would seem logical&apos;that membership should be drawn from Britain. Objection would however. be raised to : the appoint-ment by the British Government ofpersons from other commonwealth countries which have openly declared their hostility to Rhodesia.should be given to the problemsrelating to the test of acceptabilityby the people of Rhodesia as awhole. When this matter has been resolved consideration should begiven to the final steps to be taken for an agreed settlement as con-templated in (a) above.(g) This requirement is adequately met by the holding of a general election in Rhodesia and the formationthereafter of a new government.

APPENDIX CSTATEMENT OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENTS TERMS FOR ASETTLEMENT IN rhodesia the British Government have now undertaken a review of the Rhodesianproblem in the light of the recent visit of the Commonwealth secretary and Attorney-General to Salisbury during which a statement of positions on either side was drawn up.2. The British Governments attitude remains based on the principles which successive British Governments have insisted must govern any constitutional settlement for an independent- Rhodesia. The major areas of disagreement turn on the application of these principles, and are not matters to be resolved merely by detailed constitutional modifications.The constitutional settlement3. The British Government have throughout shown their readiness to explore every possibility of reaching a settlement within these principles.They have proposed, if it would facilitate the task of working out anindependence settlement within the stated principles, that there might bean entirely new constitutional approach. They have further suggested thatthe assistance of constitutional experts from the Commonwealth might bebrought in to assist in working out such a new basis for a settlement. Asa further possibility, they have also proposed that a mission of commonwealth prime Ministers might be invited to visit Rhodesia and to lend their good offices in devising a solution between Rhodesia and Britain. They havealso declared themselves ready to enter into discussions about the possibility&apos; of an &quot;Act of Union &quot; between Britain and Rhodesia. All these possibilitieshave been rejected out of hand. The British Governments considerationof the problem has therefore been confined to the possibility of a settlementbased on the 1961 Constitution with the changes necessary to give full effectto the stated principles^4. It is the British Governments purpose that the political advancement of the Africans in Rhodesia^should be brought about in a way that willpreserve good government and stability in the country, and safeguard itssocial and economic development within the concept of a society pledged to afford equal opportunity to all, regardless of race. They accept that the pace of the political advancement of the Africans should continue to be governed by achievement and merit, i.e., through the acquisition of theeconomic and educational qualifications prescribed under the 1961Constitution. In the belief that such arrangements, if fully safeguardedin a constitutional settlement which is demonstrated to be acceptable andis legally enacted, would be in the best interests of the Africans. TheBritish Government hope that the Africans would participate fully in workingthem: and they renew their previous offer of assistance towards thedevelopment of educational and economic opportunities for the Africans.The British Government, however, are not prepared to agree that Africanadvancement might after independence be arbitrarily held back through theoperation of powers left in the hands of the European minority if the21
latter judged at any time that the advent of African majority rule wouldbe &quot; premature &quot;. Such a provision would be incompatible with the principleof unimpeded progress to majority rule.5. The British Government must therefore continue to insist that theprovisions of Chapter III of the 1961 Constitution (which deal with thenumber and delimitation of constituencies and electoral districts) must be specially entrenched in any Independence Constitution.6. As regards safeguards for the specially entrenched clauses of theConstitution, the British Government would accept, as part of the necessary machinery, a Senate consisting of 12 Europeans and 12 Africans, which wouldvote together with the Lower House. They consider however that the electedelement among the Africans should be increased, to constitute an effectiveblocking quarter. There should therefore be not less than nine electedAfrican members of the Senate, though the British Government would beprepared to see up to three chiefs included: and the number of &quot; B &quot; Roll seats in the Assembly should be increased from 15 to 17.7. The British Government have throughout insisted that anyIndependence Constitution must contain safeguards for specially entrenchedclauses as effective as those provided in Section 108 of the 1961 Constitution:and it is for this reason that their proposal for an external authority whichwould finally decide on such amendments has been put forward.8. The British Government would be prepared to see the externalauthority brought into operation not by automatic reference to it of everyconstitutional Bill concerned with amendment of a specially entrenchedclause (as envisaged in their original proposals), but by a system of appeal against such an amendment. The amendment would hot come into force until the time for appeal had expired or the appeal had been finally disposedof. Such an appeal might lie in the first instance to a &quot; constitutional commission&quot; in Rhodesia, consisting of the Chief Justice and other judges:with further appeal as of right to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.The grounds of appeal should be that the amendment discriminated or hadthe effect of discriminating unjustly between the races, or contravened anyof the provisions of the Declaration of Rights contained in the Constitution.9. The British Government cannot accept the abolition of cross-votingor the fade-out of &quot; B &quot; Roll seats, since these would be incompatible withthe first and third principles. The &quot; B &quot; Roll franchise would be extendedto all Africans over 30 by appropriate amendment of the Second Scheduleto the Constitution.The fifth principle10. It remains the position of the British Government that any constitutional settlement for an independent Rhodesia must be demonstratedto their satisfaction by a fair and free test to be acceptable to the peopleof Rhodesia as a whole. Until this test has been carried out, there canbe no question of inviting the British Parliament to legislate for independence.11. If informal agreement can be reached on the form of a constitutional settlement, which meets their requirements, the British Government will beready to stand by that as the basis for negotiation with a legal governmentand for the eventual testing of Rhodesian opinion.   But they cannot accept22
that the testing of opinion should take place before there has been a returnto constitutional government in Rhodesia, the censorship has been lifted, and individuals detained on political grounds released and normal political activities permitted provided they are conducted peacefully and democraticallyand without intimidation from any quarter.12. They remain of the view that a Royal Commission should beappointed to test opinion in , Rhodesia. They would accept that the composition of the Commission and the methods by which opinion shouldbe tested should be agreed with the legal interim administration when it is established.Return to legality13. The British Government adhere to the view that, before there canbe any formal negotiation of an independence settlement, a constitutional government must be established in Rhodesia. A settlement negotiated onany other basis could not hope to secure the acceptance of the people of rhodesia as a whole, or of the British Parliament, or of the general world community.14. The British Government therefore require as the first step theappointment by the Governor of a broadly-based representative governmentad interim. This must be and be seen to be a fresh star\ a government ofnational unity representing the widest possible range of public opinion ofall races in the country.15. The Rhodesian Parliament must be in abeyance during the interim period, since it would not be appropriate for the interim government to beresponsible to the present Assembly. Rhodesian Ministers would beappointed by and responsible to the Governor who would normally act ontheir advice in all internal matters of administration, subject to his controlof the armed forces and-&apos;&apos;police as described in paragraph 17 below.16. Free expression of opinion would be assured by the removal of censorship and the assumption by the Governor of responsibility for thenational broadcasting arid television services.17. The armed forces\mid police would come under the direct responsibility of the Governor during this period. While the Governor would normally act on the advice of members of the interim government in matters concerning the armed forces and police and law and order, the BritishGovernment would need to be satisfied that he retained powers in his discretion not only to deal with domestic disturbance and illegality but alsoto prevent a repetition of unconstitutional action and to protect human rights. The British Government would reserve the right to provide military assistance for these purposes if this is required by the Governor in thisperiod. Similarly, the British Government would reserve the right, underthe Independence Constitution, to provide such assistance if this is necessary as a further guarantee of the agreed Constitution.Racial discrimination and land apportionment18. The British Government cannot accept that there is no case forany further action to give effect to the fourth principle.   They repeat their23
minimum requirement that, as a contribution / towards this, a RoyalCommission should be set up to study the problems of racial discrimination and in particular land apportionment in Rhodesia.Conclusion19. This statement by the British Government spells out in practicalform the action necessary to give effect to the principles which the BritishGovernment has clearly and consistently stated. It is now a questionwhether a return to constitutional rule can be achieved and a settlement worked out. Otherwise, the consequences for Rhodesia and indeed for the wholeof Central and Southern Africa will be incalculable. The BritishGovernment for their part stand firmly by the undertakings to which theyare committed by the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Communique inSeptember.75 October, 1966.
APPENDIX DREPLY BY THE REGIME TO THE STATEMENT OF THEBRITISH GOVERNMENTS TERMS FOR A SETTLEMENT INRHODESIA1. The Rhodesian Government have examined the document headed&quot; statement of the British Governments terms for a settlement in Rhodesia &quot;which was delivered to the Rhodesian Prime Minister by Sir Morrice James,Deputy Under-Secretary at Commonwealth Office, on Saturday,15 October, 1966.2. During the visit of the Secretary of State for Commonwealth affairs to Rhodesia in September, the respective positions of the British andRhodesian Governments were analysed. The analysis demonstrated thatthere was no prospect of a negotiated settlement unless each side were tomake some move towards the other. The terms submitted by the BritishGovernment indicated disappointing inflexibility on their part and that theyhave scarcely moved towards the Rhodesian position.3. The Rhodesian Government now submit their comments on theBritish statement. \British paragraph 34. The claim is made that the British Government have throughoutshown their readiness to explore every possibility of reaching a settlement.A whole year has now elapsed since Rhodesia declared her independence.In that period the British Government have made no effort to seek a negotiated settlement with the Rhodesian Government; indeed for a longtime they refused even to talk with the Rhodesian Government, and whenthey did their communique conveyed that ,the talks were exploratory andwithout commitments. Therefore it would seem that they have neverseriously contemplated a negotiated settlement with the rhodesian government. It is evident that they are hoping for Rhodesia&apos;s capitulationto open the way for the imposition of a new Constitution fashioned to theirown ends after a period of direct rule.5. The paragraph distorts facts in a manner that serves only to aggravatefeelings. The British Governments proposal that there might be an entirely new constitutional approach and their other similar suggestions were notrejected out of hand by Rhodesia. The fact is the Rhodesian Prime minister pointed out to the Secretary of State that the exploration of any settlementnot based on the 1961 Constitution would take as long as one year or eventwo years to complete, which would, in prevailing circumstances be undesirable. Moreover, it would involve seeking a fresh mandate from the electorate with all the complications this would entail. The Secretary ofState concurred with this view. The British Government have been well aware of the desire of Rhodesians to reach a settlement on a basis of the1961 Constitution which they had been led to believe was the threshold to independence. Having regard also to the historical background to thesituation and to the exclusion of Rhodesia from the Commonwealth forum25
long before her declaration of independence, also to the continuous maliciousattacks which have been made upon Rhodesia in that forum, and also to thegeneral distrust which the handling of Rhodesian afTairs by successive british governments have engendered in minds of Rhodesia ns, it is little wonder thatthese generalised proposals and suggestions of the British Government havenot been received with any confidence.British paragraphs 4, 5 and 96. The Rhodesian Government note that it is the British Governmentspurpose that the political advancement of the Africans in Rhodesia shouldbe brought about in a way that will preserve good Government stability inthe country, and safeguard its social and economic development within the concept of a society pledged to afford flexible opportunity to all, regardless of race. The Rhodesians subscribed to this idea but have misgivings aboutthe way in which the British Government propose to achieve it. Recenthappenings in Africa raise serious doubts about the wisdom of forcing the pace of African political advancement. The Rhodesian approach, on theother hand, provides opportunity for the growth of respect for tradition andconvention which is a cardinal feature of any well-ordered society and isessential for a truly democratic Parliamentary system. The british governments terms seize upon every means of accelerating the pace tomajority rule, to a degree which, in the Rhodesian Governments view, wouldnot only defeat the purpose, but indicate a disregard of the principles whichthe British Government themselves have laid down in paragraph 4 of their statement. It is the Rhodesians, not the British people, who would suffer from the consequences of the institution of ill-advised constitutionalprovisions.7. It is with these general considerations in mind that the rhodesian government submit the following proposals:(a) that the &quot; B &quot; Roll franchise be extended to include all male Africansover 30 years of age; providing that the cross-voting system iseliminated. The effect of this proposal would be to enfranchise atleast 400,000 Africans, although they will not have the minimumqualifications which even the British Government accept as necessaryfor measuring achievement and merit. However, to preserve this principle of maintaining standards, it is necessary to eliminatecross-voting. The cross-voting system is complicated and the effectsare not readily understood by many voters and candidates. Themisunderstanding of the effects will be accentuated by the additionof 400,000 voters who have not even the elementary &quot; B&quot; Rollqualifications;(b) that the present 15 &quot; B&quot; Roll electoral districts be specially entrenched. This replaces an earlier proposal for fade-out of theseSeats and removes any British Governments fears of reduction of african representation in the Assembly or of disenfranchisement of&quot;B &quot; Roll voters;(c) that an additional 15 seats be reserved for Europeans in the LegislativeAssembly, such seats to be phased-in as African advancement on the\       .26
&quot; A &quot; Roll develops for each African elected on the &quot; A &quot; Roll, oneEuropean reserved seat would be created, until the maximum of 15was reached.Having regard to the existence of the 15 &quot; B &quot; Roll seats which will, inpractice, be African seats and to the British Governments sixth principle,it is logical to provide 15 reserved seats for Europeans. These, together withthe European representatives in the Senate, would form a blocking quarter.Without these additional seats it would be possible in time for there to beno European in the Legislative Assembly, thereby frustrating the second andsixth principles.8. The British Government continue to insist that the provisions of chapter III of 1961 Constitution must bs specially entrenched. the rhodesian Government are prepared to agree to the special entrenchment ofall the provisions of Chapter III with the exception of Section 37, subject to paragraph 7 (b). This section determines the number of constituencies andelectoral - districts. It would be unprecedented for the Assembly to be deprived of its right to increase its membership through additionalconstituencies when expansion and growth of the country so demands.British paragraph 69.   This paragraph refers to safeguards for the I specially entrenchedclauses of the Constitution. Here there is wide measure^ of agreement. both governments accept a Senate of 24 persons consisting of 12 Europeans and12 Africans and tint on amendments to the specially handled clauses of theConstitution, the Senate would vote together with lower house, with one quarter forming an effective block. However, of the 12 Africans in the senate, the Rhodesian Government believe there should be six Chiefs and six elected Africans, whereas the British Government believe there shouldbe nine elected Africans and only three chiefs. In last year&apos;s negotiations the Rhodesian Government had contemplated a Senate of 12 chiefs alone.The Senate is the natural and proper place for the representation of thechiefs along with others, for a Senate, in/contrast to a lower house, is anorgan for the representation of groups, not of aggregates of individual voters,and chiefs, above all, are the spokesmen of the tribal entities with their own internal and long-established arrangements for sounding and expressing the will of their peoples. These arrangements are realistic in the sense that theyare understood, familiar and functional. The Western device of the ballotbox, in a tribal context, is exotic, misunderstood and mistrusted as has been only too clearly demonstrated by the events in one country after another in africa. The chiefs are given their positions and derive their authority to speak for their people from complex rites of succession unique to each tribe,and it is more accurate to consider them as social institutions rather thanindividuals. As institutions they are accepted and respected as therepresentatives of the great bulk of the African population. When a chiefspeaks he does so as the collective voice of his people and the very nature ofhis position binds him to do so in the interest of his people. In to-day&apos;scontext the carrying out of their traditional and public duties involved themin expense and to suggest that the modest recompense they receive in thisconnection turns them into servants of the Government is absurd. Arepresentation of six chiefs elected by an electoral college of chiefs to the27
Senate is the minimum which the Rhodesian Government consider adequate and necessary to give full and realistic communal representation to the africans, the vast majority of whom are tribesmen, and to do justice to the vital and important status and role the chiefs are accorded by their people.Whatever the British Government might feel about chiefs belonging to abygone age, it is to be noted that the Constitutions granted by Britain toLesotho and Botswana make provision for senates or upper houses of chiefs.10. As minimum African representation in both houses under theforegoing proposals would exceed the number required to provide an effective block to amendment of the specially entrenched clauses, the British proposal to increase &quot;B&quot; Roll seats in the Assembly from 15 to 17 is unnecessary and undesirable.British paragraphs 7 and 811. As regards further safeguards for specially entrenched clauses the rhodesian Government are prepared to consider a system of appeal to an internal authority possibly a constitutional commission in Rhodesia, onthe lines of British proposal, but thoy are not willing to accept the proposalfor a right of further appeal to an external authority. The establishment ofsuch an external authority would not be compatible with independence.The proposal that the grounds of appeal should be. that the amendmentsdiscriminated unjustly between the races would be / acceptable, but the rhodesian Government have /serious doubts about the acceptability of aprovision for appeal on the grounds that the amendment had the effect ofdiscriminating. The proposal that the grounds of appeal should includecontravention of the provisions of the declaration of rights, would have theeffect of making the declaration of rights immutable.British paragraph 1812. With regard to the British suggestion for a commission to studyproblems of racial discrimination and land apportionment the rhodesian government point &quot;put that in Rhodesia land apportionment legislation iscontinually being amended to meet the changing conditions while racial discrimination which is, of course, not unique to Rhodesia, is constantlybeing reduced in a practical manner. Accordingly, the rhodesian government believes such a commission would serve no purpose. However,they are prepared to discuss the suggestion.British paragraphs 10 to 1713. The Rhodesian Government recognise that the British Governmentare entitled to satisfy themselves that any settlement, the form of which hasbeen agreed upon beforehand by the two Governments, is acceptable to thepeople of Rhodesia as a whole. When the form of settlement has beenagreed, the Rhodesian Government would co-operate with the BritishGovernment to determine the procedures required for testing the fifthprinciple. Once this stage has been completed and a new Constitution hasbeen finally determined by the Governments, the Rhodesian Governmentwould be prepared to enter into discussions with the British Governmentbringing the new Constitution into legal force and effect.   The Rhodesian28
Government believes that it must be obvious to all that they could not contemplate the abandonment of the 1965 Constitution until a settlement hasbeen arranged and secured.Conclusions14. It now seems clear that the differences between the two Governmentsregarding the changes to be made to the 1961 Constitution are not now so great that they cannot be bridged by negotiations. The rhodesian government therefore invite the Secretary of State to come to Salisbury with full powers to reach final agreement on the settlement.4 November, 1966.
secret appendix EANSWER BY REGIME TO QUESTIONS PUT BY HER MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT TO Mr. SMITHThe Rhodesian Government received on Friday, 11 November, from theHead of the British High Commission residual staff in Salisbury a writtenrequest from the British Government for replies to the three questions arisingfrom their examination of the Rhodesian Governments reply to the Britishstatement of terms for a settlement in Rhodesia.2. The Rhodesian Government believes that the form of the constitution and the conditions of its acceptability must be determined as a whole andnot piece-meal. They therefore regard the issues raised in the questions to be matters which cannot be resolved by distant questions and answersof a categorical nature, but only by personal negotiation. However, subjectto these comments, they make the following points in clarification.Question No. 1No. The reason is already given in paragraph 8 of the RhodesianGovernments reply to the British Governments statement. The rhodesian government wishes to maintain the right of the Assembly, already implicit in the 1961 Constitution, to increase the number of constituencies to meetthe needs of a young and growing country. Chapter III cannot, however,be taken in isolation from the other constitutional issues.Question No. 2Until the constitutional settlement has been disposed of and acknowledgedby the British Government as having passed the test of acceptability, the rhodesian Government cannot commit themselves to an operation, detailsof which would yet have to be settled by negotiations. A decision on this issue would be influenced by the nature of the new Constitution and by its general acceptance.Question No. 3Before the first part of this question is answered the rhodesian government would like the British Government to answer another question:In the event of the Rhodesian Governments agreeing to relinquish the1965 Constitution, would the British Government agree to stand by theconstitutional settlement previously agreed by the two Governments inorder to guarantee that Rhodesia would not find herself without a constitution in the event of the testing of opinion under Principle No. 5 going againstthe proposed new Constitution?The Rhodesian Government concede the need to modify censorship duringthe process of testing of opinion and are prepared to discuss territorialquestions with the British Government. The Rhodesian Government wishto point out, however, that the main reason for censorship in Rhodesia isto counter hostile economic and psychological action being taken against this country by Britain.30
No persons are detained on purely political grounds. Persons aredetained when they constitute a threat to public security. There should beno need to remind the British Government of the dangers inherent in the link-up of external terrorists with these lawless elements, and of how thishas been encouraged by subversive broadcasts beamed from adjacentterritories. Has not British aid to Zambian broadcasting been given withreckless disregard of the consequences? The Rhodesian Government wouldhave no objection to the views of those in detention being made known tothe testing authority. The arrangement would be a matter for discussion bythe two Governments.3. The Rhodesian Government are confident that, once the twoGovernments have reached agreement on the form of the Constitution, animprovement in relations between them should pave the way for agreement upon the issues concerned with the subsequent stages. The rhodesian government renew their invitation to the Secretary of State to come to salisbury to settle by negotiation the form of the new independenceConstitution.17 November, 1966.
