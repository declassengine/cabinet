C(66) 149 COPY NO.11&apos;.&quot;\V&apos;;&apos;7th November, 1966CABINETEUROPEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in his summing up in Cabinet on 3rd November(CC(66) 54th Conclusions, Minute 4) the Prime Minister outlined a programme of action designed to obtain the information necessary toenable Her Majesty&apos;s Government to decide their future policy towardsthe Europen Economic Community (e.c.),    The programme proposed was as follows(a) After consultations with the Governments of the european free Trade Association (EFTA), a conference of EFTAHeads of Government in London should be called for earlyDecember, to consider the steps to be followed in furtherapproaches to the e.c..(b) There should be an announcement, probably at the sametime as the announcement of the EFTA conference,reaffirming our willingness to enter the Community onappropriate terms, and stating that the Prime Ministerand I would accordingly make a series of visits to the heads of Government of the Six to make our requirementsclear and to ascertain theirs.(c) The January meeting of the Consultative Assembly atStrasbourg might be the occasion for the Prime Ministerto make a full statement of Her Majesty&apos;s governments attitude to Europe; the terms of the statement would need to be considered by the Cabinet.(d) Thereafter the Prime Minister and I should carry outthe proposed visits both to explore conditions of membership and to press for a forthcoming attitude in the Kennedy Round.For the former purpose it would be necessary to have an agreed formula on our attitude to the Treaty of Rome, whichwould no doubt be on the basis of qualified acceptance,(For amplification of these points see Annex to this paper).(e) Urgent studies should be made by officials of both the&quot;Javits&quot; plan and also of the prospects of our continuingwithout any new form of association, in order to strengthen our position in any subsequent negotiations, and to consider what it should be if they failed.flS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
(f)     It would be necessary to decide the nature and timing of consultations with the Governments of the commonwealth and of the United States in regard to our further movestowards Europe,    Those consultations might, in turn,reveal further possible courses of action.2.     The above programme needs some further elaborationespecially in regard to point (a) - Consultations with EFTA governments and (f) - the Nature and Timing of Consultations with the Governments ofthe Commonwealth and the United States.3.     There must be preliminary consultations with EFTAGovernments, before the proposed Conference of EFTA PrimeMinisters,    It will he necessary to impress on EFTA governments the need for complete secrecy as regards our intentions.4.     It may be argued that if we are to have a meeting of EFTAHeads of Government we should have a similar Commonwealth meeting.This is a matter for the Commonwealth Secretary, but in my &quot;view, theCommonwealth situation is different from that of EFTA, in that ourEFTA partners are all in Europe and all potential members of an expanded European Economic Community.    I therefore recommendthat we should notify Commonwealth Governments, the Government ofthe Irish Republic, and the Government of the United States of our intentions shortly before the announcement proposed at (b) above.    in doing so we shall need to make it clear to Commonwealth governments that the policy represents a continuation, at a higher level, of that wehave pursued over the last few months, that there is no question of anearly negotiation for entry into the Community, and that we are not committed to such a course.    Simple notification to the United states would be sufficient since we would not wish it to appear that any move-ment in our European policy is dependent upon permission from theUnited States.5.     In addition I have the following comments on points (b) and (c)above.    It would be essential to make simultaneous announcementsabout the EFTA Conference and our projected tour.    It would also bedesirable for at least one of our visits to the capitals of the Six to bemade before the Prime Minister speaks in Strasbourg, since theStrasbourg meeting does not begin until 23rd January.G. B.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.7th November, 1966.-2-
NOTE ON VISITS TO BE MADE TO CAPITALS OF THE   ,EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY BY THEPRIME MINISTER AND FOREIGN secretary in their visits to the capitals of the Six the Prime Ministerand I would be seeking on the one hsnd to explain the principaldifficulties we see in accepting Community policies as they standand on the other hand to obtain a clear indication of how far eachof the Six would be prepared to go in meeting us on thosedifficulties.    We would thus be continuing, in greater depth, theprocess of probing which began this summer.    Only when this process is completed will we be in a position to judge whether ornot to embark on negotiation for entry into the e.c..    Whether ornot the discussions had shown that a basis for negotiation existedwould be for the Cabinet to decide.2.      In addition to this, we should take this opportunity, at what may well be a crucial stage in the Kennedy Round negotiations, topress for a forthcoming attitude on the part of the Six.3.      The Prime Minister and I would continue to make clear inour discussions that whatever emerges from the continued processof probing, we should only enter with a healthy economy and astrong balance of payments, and on terms which would not call inquestion either the strength of the economy or the value of sterling.4.      As to political questions, these are more likely to arise inthe discussion with the French Government than in the discussions with the Five.    French Ministers (though not General de Gaulle)have said that there is no political veto.    NeverthelessGeneral de Gaulle might well raise the question of our closeinvolvement with the United States.    If he does, we can only stand firm.    Some common ground may be found with him over thequestion of supranationality.TREATY OF ROME5.      The Prime Minister and I will be asked whetherHer Majesty*s Government accept the Treaty of Rome.    It issuggested that we should say that the Treaty in itself would not bean obstacle to our joining the European Economic Community if our problems could be satisfactorily dealt with whether throughadaptations of the arrangements made under the Treaty, or in anyother acceptable manner.    In other words, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment were prepared to accept the Treaty of Rome, subjectto the necessary adjustments consequent on the accession of a new member, provided that Her Majesty&apos;s Government receivedsatisfaction on the points on which they saw difficulty.6.       The difficulties we see in accepting Community policies areprincipally concentrated in two particular fields: those flowingfrom the Common Agricultural Policy, and from the Communitypolicy on freedom of capital movements.    The Prime Minister andI will emphasise that although these are the two most important aspects there are other problems, e.g. regional policy and the ability of certain Commonwealth countries to associate with theCommunity.-3-ANNEX
0-4-COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY7.     The Community^ present policy and price structure mightwell in terms of aggregate income prove no less profitable to UnitedKingdom agriculture - perhaps in some respects even more profitable -but at the expense of unbalancing its production, e, g.  as betweencereals and livestock production, including dairying.    Other effects ofthe common agricultural policy would be to increase our balance ofpayments burden, to damage Commonwealth trade and to increase thecost of living and, in consequence, wages and costs.8.     The Prime Minister and I would say in our discussions with the six that the consequences of accepting the common agricultural policyunchanged would be serious.    Some way of overcoming the difficultiesmust be found if we are to join.    We would suggest that we would needarrangements to limit what would otherwise be a disproportionateburden.    ha any event in an enlarged Community it would be necessaryto review the distribution of the burden of agricultural support.    and special arrangements would have to be made for New Zealand inparticular. V,CAPITAL MOVEMENTS9.     A requirement to dismantle our foreign exchange controlswould endanger our balance of payments in the early years of member-ship, even though in the longer term there would be more favourableinfluences at work.10,     The Prime Minister and I would explain the problem with whichthe United Kingdom would be confronted if we were required toliberalise portfolio and direct investment immediately - even though we would expect that our economic, and especially our balance ofpayments situation would be basically restored by the time of entry.We would require satisfactory provision for this problem, whetherthrough adaptations of the arrangements under the Treaty or any otheracceptable way.    Meanwhile we should continue to seek throughappropriate channels some long term arrangement for the sterling balances.
