C(66) 157 COPY NO.11th November, 1966CABINET67FAMILY endowment memorandum by the Minister of Social security  understand that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is opposed toa scheme involving increased family allowances and correspondingly reduced income tax child allowances, oi the kind outlined ins the recent report by the Official Committee on Social Services.    While I appreciate the Chancellor^ difficulties about this type of scheme, it would, in my view, be deeply unfortunate if they were held to outweigh its great meritsas compared with any other course available to us at this time.2.       Publication of the findings of my Ministryrs recent familycircumstances survey can hardly be delayed beyond the spring or early summer.    They will confirm the existence of child poverty so wide-spread as to call for early action.    In view of our many publishedstatements about our determination to attack this problem once thefacts have been established, and the likely reaction of the ChildPoverty Action Group and back-bench MPs to the report, I do not see how we could then continue to let matters drift, even if there were noproposal to raise school meal charges, etc, next year.    that proposal, together with the expected rise in local authority rents inthe new year and the necessary increase in the national insurancestamp when benefits are raised later on, could offset any increased wages which lower paid workers may gain if they receive some prioritywhen the incomes freeze is relaxed.    If we allow the position of lower-income families to deteriorate still further, we shall be exacerbatingan already gross injustice, and we shall be inviting the strongest public and parliamentary reaction,3,      In view of current and prospective financial limitations, thereare only two ways of making an early and substantial impact on childpoverty (including the problem of families whose national assistance iswage-stopped).    One is the family allowance/tax allowance type of scheme; the other is a new means-tested scheme to supplement the earnings of people in full-time work.    What is at issue here is notmerely a matter of weighing the cost and effectiveness of two alternativetypes of family endowment.    The choice before us has social and political implications which go far beyond this.    In my view we stand here at acrossroad which is crucial for our v/hole social security policy.    Ifthrough short-term considerations we were to go down the means-tested road now, not only would this go against all we have ever preachedon this subject;  it would make it exceedingly difficult, if not impossible,to get back on to the other - and I believe the right - road.b DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
4.       &quot;Whatever might be said in theory, I do not believe that a means-tested scheme could be merely a temporary stop-gap.    Apart from thefact that it would not seem sensible to create a new means-tested system -involving special legislation, the creation of new administrative machinery and the taking on of a considerable number of extra staff - merely to bridgea short time gap, any likely subsequent family allowances increase would fall well short of the amount needed to float off from the means-testedscheme all the families who would meanwhile have come on to it -especially if the increase were limited to what could be afforded out ofgeneral taxation, with no offsetting reduction of tax child allowances.5.       But, when the  time came, v/ould any family allowances increasein fact take place?    Not merely would the impetus for it be lost once the poorest were looked after by the means-tested scheme, but it would infact give least to the poorest, since a corresponding reduction would haveto be made in their means-tested payment.6.       There v/ould be many claims on the public purse of greaterurgency than a family allowances increase in such circumstances.Rather, the balance would be likely to swing the other way, and the usefulness of a restricted (and indeed, in real terms, declining) family allowances scheme would be increasingly questioned, now that the poorest were looked after by other means.    The savings to be obtained by cutting family allowances expenditure would obviously be extremelytempting, and I have little doubt that in time, perhaps by stages, thescheme would be wound up.     The result of this would be much larger numbers on the means-tested scheme than anything now envisaged.Even if there were some degree of &quot;tapering&quot; in the scheme - which would,of course, increase the numbers eligible under it - the total effect onworking incentives could become serious,7.       This would be all the more deplorable because it v/ould be sounnecessary.    The family allowanee/tax allowance type of schemedoes not give help indiscriminately but only to those not within thestandard rate tax range.    By using the already existing tax system toprovide an automatic test of income, it produces a considerable degreeof concentration of help on the neediest families, without the need for aseparate means test of any kind.    For example, the scheme illustratedin the Official Committee^ report would involve a net cost of about 30 million a year in a normal year, of which about half v/ould go to the160, 000 families below the supplementary benefit level and a good partof the remainder to those in the area immediately above that level.A married couple with three children under age 11, for instance, would gain the full 20s, a week increase if their gross earnings were lessthan about  12 15s. Od. a week.    Above this level there would be atapering effect up to the beginning of the standard rate range, wherethe break-even area would begin.8.       It is important to realise that the scheme just mentioned isillustrative only.    A variety of schemes costing less can be produced,although to make a really substantial impact on the problem of childpoverty would probably require not less than about  20 million a year(and rather more in the first year, depending on the type of scheme).-2-confs dents al
9.      I strongly urge rny colleagues to agree on a scheme of this kind intime for it to come into operation next April.    This would requireimmediate decisions so that a Bill could be prepared and introduced before Christmas.10.      If in the event - which I do not accept - it were judged impossible,for one reason or another, to have a scheme involving tax allowanceadjustments in operation before April, 1968, I am quite sure it would bedisastrously short-sighted to go for a means-tested scheme on the groundthat it could be brought into operation a few months earlier.    Even astarting date as late as next September for such a scheme must bespeculative at present.    In the case of a &quot;housing allowance&quot; type of scheme, which has attracted some of my colleagues, a good deal ofprior consultation with outside bodies might well prove necessary, since,as the Official Committee pointed out, this type of scheme might encourage rent increases and complicate rent and rate rebate schemesoperated by local authorities.    And, of course, if means-tested relief is thought necessary for those families who cannot afford the higherschool meal charges, there is no need for a new scheme, sincearrangements for the remission of such charges already exist.11.       While the implications for incomes policy are not my concern,I should have thought that a scheme of improved family allowancescoupled with income tax child allowance adjustments would be muchmore acceptable to the trade unions, and more helpful in dealing withpressure for wage improvements based on the difficulties of low-paid workers with families, than a means-tested scheme.12.       I hope rny colleagues will agree that the question of family endowment and the attack on child poverty is of such fundamental importance that it should not be determined by short-term considerations.]Vi.
