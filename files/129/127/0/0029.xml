CONFIDENTIAL &quot;        217S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY CF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)68C(66) 170 COPY NO.16th November, 1966CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1967-68:  FINANCE FOR CONTAINER shipd memorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretary ofState for Economic affairs my colleagues should be aware of a proposal approved in principle by the Ministerial Committee on Economic Development at a meetingunder my chairmanship on 14th November, which may involve an additionto public expenditure in 1967-68.2.       The proposal is set out in the attached memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade.    It is briefly that provision should beincluded in the Bill to set up the Shipbuilding Industry Board for anadditional credit of  30 million to be made available to shipping firmsplacing orders for British ships, where the orders would enable animportant development in ship design or construction to be undertaken in British yards and would contribute to the formation of groups in shipbuilding which would be to the long term advantage of the industry.This provision would be in addition to the provision for loans of up to 30 million already envisaged in the Bill for promoting structuralreorganisation in the industry as recommended by the Geddes Committee,3,       The immediate purpose of this provision would be to enableBritish shipbuilders to eompete on level credit terms with Japaneseshipbuilders for orders shortly to be placed by a British consortium(Overseas Containers Limited) for container ships to the value of  27million.    The Japanese builders can offer credit to overseas buyers at-1 per cent interest for 8$ per cent of the cost of the ships,    YIq,however, only make similar terms available for foreign buyers.    Theproposed credit would enable loans to be made at the Exchequer lendingrate as well as grants designed to bridge the gap between the Exchequerlending rate and the lower rate offered by our competitors abroad.4,       The Ministerial Committee on Economic Development agreedthat it was important for British shipbuilding to gain a footing in themarket for container ships, and that the proposal should be approved subject to agreement between the Treasury, Board of Trade and Ministryipf Technology on a formula to be embodied in the legislation which would effectively confine the use of the credit to cases in line with the proposals in paragraph 2 above.    It is proposed that in the event of British yardssubmitting tenders which are competitive in other respects with tendersfrom abroad, we should announce our intention before the consortiumplaces its orders and therefore in advance of the legislation:  tendershave been called for by the consortium by 17th November.-1-
Department of Economic Affairs, S.W.1.15th November, 1966-2-5.       The loans from the proposed additional credit would be likely tobe drawn in instalments over a period of two to three years and wouldinvolve additional public expenditure.    Since the meeting of the ministerial Committee on Economic Development, it has been estimatedthat expenditure on this account repayable over the loan period mightbe up to  10 million in 1967-68.    The cost to the Exchequer of grants to bridge the gap between the Exchequer lending rate and the lowerinterest rate available from overseas competitors would amount to amaximum of about  ^ million spread over the period of the loans.The Ministry of Technology will consider whether any compensatingsaving for the grant could be secured elsewhere in their Estimates.6.      I invite my colleagues, having considered the financial implications, to endorse the decision of the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Development.M. S.
9i Qht X oFINANCE FOR CONTAINER shipd memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of TradeOverseas Containers Ltd., a consortium comprising P &amp; 0, BlueFunnel and other shipping groups, has sought tenders from a numberof British and foreign shipbuilders for six container ships.They are expected to cost about  27 m. and are required for a newfast service to the Far East beginning early in ^^6^.2,     The company insist that it must get the best credit termsavailable for these ships.     This is understandable.     The opera-tion as a whole is a costly venture in which the consortium willbe sinking  1+5 m, including  18 m. for containers and land-basedhandling facilities.     The cost of the capital is likely to be a significant factor in determining whether the operation is acommercial success.3.     Japanese tenders are expected to carry the usual credit termsmade available for ship exports by the Japanese Government - 80%of the contract price over 8-10 years at 5zfo interest.     these terms are roughly similar to those we offer for exports of such goods.     But the best terms which Overseas Containers Ltd. or british shipbuilders can obtain commercially will involve an interest rate of around 8^.     In consequence, if our shipbuildersare able to match the Japanese on price and on the tight deliverydate, they are still likely to lose the orders because of the disparity between Government export credit rates in Japan and thecommercial rate here.h.     This disparity in interest rates affects many capital goodsbut it has a special and increasing importance for ships.Unlike most other capital goods, ships attract no import duty andthere is little or no hidden protection because ships are built to international standards for operation on the high seas.     Inaddition shipowners in most countries rely to a much greater extent than most other purchasers of capital goods upon raisingup to 80% or more of the cost by a mortgage on the goods purchased.Indeed, as so many foreign merchant fleets are not backed by&quot;sizeable domestic shipbuilding industries, export credit is ofspecial importance as a source of finance for ships.     Japan, theonly other non-Communist country with both a big fleet and a bigshipbuilding industry, provides credits for home purchasers ofships on even better terms than for export customers.5.     For all these reasons I have been pressed by British buildersand owners to rectify the present anomalous position which canresult in our shipbuilding industry taking foreign orders whileBritish shipowners purchase abroad simply because of the favourablecredit terms widely available for exports.     I have, however,resisted this because British yards have had sufficient work tokeep them occupied, and I did not wish to weaken the industry&apos;swill to make the changes in method and organisation which I believe to be essential in the long term.     The special credit scheme for1
home owners which our predecessors arranged did nothing to bringabout these necessary changes.     No doubt with these considerations in mind the G-eddes Committee did not suggest any general credit scheme, though they recommended that one should be held in reserve in case it was needed to give the new shipbuilding groups a goodstart in 1968/70.6.     But I consider that the present case justifies a special arrangement to ensure that the order is not lost to United Kingdomyards solely on credit grounds.     Over the next few years we expect the speedy development of container services on oceanic aswell as short-sea routes.     Japanese shipowners are expected to order 29 such ships shortly mainly for the Pacific routes with government credit on the usual generous terms for orders placed at home.     The six ships which the United Kingdom consortium isordering are of a sophisticated type based on the latest Americanpractice.     The design provided by the consortium may not berevolutionary;   but construction will present some novel andchallenging problems and the experience gained in building andfitting out these ships will be of the greatest value to theindustry.     Moreover, I think that if we are the first or amongthe first to build such ships outside the subsidised andinefficient U.S. industry, it will be an important factor in our ability to obtain further orders for container ships of all types.7.     I do not think that an exceptional arrangement of this kind would be seriously open to challenge internationally:    not only dothe Japanese provide cheap credit for virtually all domestic shiporders, but the U.S., Prance, Italy and many other countries sub-sidise their shipbuilders directly;    and many fleets including theNorwegian rely largely on the export credit facilities of othercountries to finance their ship investment.     At home it might besaid that the arrangement was inconsistent with our current generalpolicy on credit, but we can point out that in this case the technological and balance of payments advantages are particularlystrong.     I do not moreover think that other capital goods pro-ducers, whose home market is protected by tariffs, could make agood case for similar treatment.     No doubt we should be pressed to extend these facilities to all domestic ship purchases.     my view is that having made special provision to support majortechnological development and re-organisation of the shipbuilding industry, we could and should continue to resist such an extensions8.     My Department has discussed with other Departments concerned the possible machinery for implementing such an arrangement.     TheIndustrial Reorganisation Corporation have confirmed that this isnot a suitable project for them, because it does not bear directlyenough on the reorganisation of an industry.     It cannot be fittedinto the arrangements for financing export credits;   and the pro-vision of a Bank of England guarantee would not secure a lowenough interest rate.9.     I have concluded that the best arrangement would be to intro-duce a special and limited scheme of credit for United Kingdomshipowners placing orders in United Kingdom yards.     legislation would be necessary and this could most conveniently take the formof a provision in the legislation setting up the shipbuilding industry Board, which already envisages the possibility of a special and limited  30 m. credit scheme as recommended by the geddes committee.   Because of the tight delivery requirements it is unlikely that more than part of the present order could be placedin the United Kingdom, but it is necessary to provide for other possible orders of similar importance.For instance, it now seems that the other container consortium(which includes the Blue Star Line and Port Line, a Cunard2
(ii hj -1subsidiary) are developing plans for a container service in theAustralian trade with a likelihood of issuing tenders before longand may well make an approach to the Government on broadly thesame lines as O.C.L.I propose, therefore, that we should provide for additionalcredit, not exceeding  30 m., to be made available only when theMinister of Technology, (who will shortly be responsible for ship building) after consultation with me on shipping considerations,is satisfied that -(a) the credit would enable work involving an importantdevelopment in ship design and construction to be under-taken in British yards which have the capacity to take on additional work;    and(b) the placing of the order in British yards would contribute to the formation of groups with long term advantages forthe industry.The Minister of Technology would, no doubt, take the advice of the shipbuilding Industry Board on the second of these criteria.     Inthis way the new arrangements would tend to reinforce our efforts to modernise and rationalise the industry.     As it is contemplated that all loans under the S.I.B. legislation will be at theExchequer lending rate, it would be necessary for the Minister tohave power to make grants calculated to reduce the effective rateof interest to match that offered by competing yards.10.   This is a matter of urgency.     Tenders should reach the con-sortium by 17th November.     If the delivery schedule is to bemaintained, orders will have to be placed within about a month andthis will be before the new proposed legislation can be passed.This difficulty can be overcome if as soon as we know whether theBritish tenders match up to the Japanese on price and delivery,the Government announces its intention to take powers of the kind Ihave suggested in paragraph 8 and if the Ministry of Technology andthe Shipbuilding Industry Board indicate their intention to approvethis order.     On this basis I would expect that the consortiumwould agree to place orders in any British yards where tenders werecompetitive in other material respects.     It would however benecessary for Ministers to decide quickly on their policy in advanceso that the necessary drafting of the legislation could be put inhand.11 .   I seek the agreement of my colleagues that if and when british yards submit tenders for these container ships which are reasonablycompetitive with those from overseas yards, I should announce our intention to introduce a scheme on the lines suggested in paragraph3o     I also seek agreement to the procedure outlined in paragraph 10.DoP*ToJo1 Oth November, 1966Board of Trade,London, S.W.1 .3
