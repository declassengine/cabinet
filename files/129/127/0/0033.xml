confidential   INTRODUCTIONDecision in principle1.     On 1st March 1966, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the House of Commons the Government&apos;a decision that theUnited Kingdom will adopt a decimal currency system in February1971.   The   will remain the major unit of currency but will hedivided into 100 minor units instead of into twenty shillingseach of twelve pence.2.     This is an historic decision.   Decimalisation of the currencyhas been a recurrent theme in public and Parliamentary debate for about a century and a half.   During the last six or seven years the pace has quickened and there has been a growing acceptance ofAthe need for a change.   In 1960^a joint report by committeesappointed by the British Association for the Advancement of science and the Association of British Chambers of Commercerevealed considerable support for a change throughout industryand commerce, and in 1961 opinion was influenced by the successfulchange-over carried out in South Africa from an      s.     d. systemvery similar to our own.3.     In December 1961 a Committee of Inquiry on Decimal Currencywas appointed under the Chairmanship of the Earl of Halsburywith these terms of reference:(a) to advise on the most convenient and practical form whicha decimal currency might take, including the major and minor units to be adopted.confidential/ &apos;Decimal Coinage and the Metric System: Should Britain Change?1 -Butterworth&apos;s Scientific Publications.
CONFIDENTIAL(b) to advise on the timing and phasing of the change-overbest calculated to minimise the cost.(c) to estimate the probable amount and incidence of the costto the economy of proposals based on (a) and (b).The Committee were not asked to advise on whether decimalisationwas desirable, but their Report, published in September 1963(Cmnd.21h5) * illustrates in striking fashion the main difficulty which has prevented an earlier decision to decimalise: that of deciding which decimal system to adopt.   By a majority of fourt two the Committee recommended the adoption of a  -cent-i system.m *The minority recommended a 1Os.-cent system,ftecent historyk.     Since the publication of the Halsbury Report the case for moving to a decimal system has grown stronger.   Australia, oneof the few remaining countries with an       s.     d. currency system,decimalised in February this year; New Zealand follows suit inJuly 1967.   The Republic of Ireland decided as long ago asFebruary 1962 that a decimal system of currency should be adopted.Soon the United Kingdom will be the only major country in tinsworld without the benefit of a decimal currency.   Meanwhile, thereis evidence that in industry and commerce support for the change is growing.   It is against this background that the Government,after careful study of the implications of the change-over, tookits decision.confidential* The Halsbury Committee used the word 1 cent&apos; as a convenienttechnical expression for the minor unit of account in a decimalsystem under which a major unit is divided into 100 minor units(as &quot;mil&apos; is similarly used for the minor unit in a &apos;three place9decimal system).   To avoid confusion it is also used in this way in the early paragraphs of this White Paper, along with the preferredexpression   new penny&apos;.   See paragraphs 20-22.
II   THE BENEFITS OP DECIMALISATIONThe faarmonlflfttlon of money and non-money calculations5.     Decimalising the currency will be an important aid toproductivity.   In ordinary arithmetic we count in tens; in      8.     d. money calculations we count in twelves, twentiesand tens.   Decimalisation of the currency will bring about aharmonisation of money and non-money calculations and, as aresult, money calculations  will be quicker, easier, and lessprone to error.   Savings will occur in all walks of life.   all will benefit.   For  shoppers and shop assistants the mechanicsof payment and change-giving will be streamlined.   But themost obvious savings will occur in offices and in schools.Office work and office machines6.     In offices - and of course in banks - the mental and paperwork of monetary calculation will be greatly simplified.   Inaddition, all the aids available for ordinary calculation,ranging from slide rules and log tables to adding and accountingmachines, will also be usable for money calculation.   Special     Sod. monetary machines will no longer be needed andthis advantage will be increased by the fact that a decimalnotation is more economical than our      s.     d. system in its use of figures,   making it possible to use cheaper machines of lower recording capacity.   Because almost all other countries have decimal currencies,       s.   d. monetary machines are non-standard; manufacturers have to produce special models for theUnited Kingdom market.   When we have a decimal currency mostmachines will be standard; this should enable our manufacturers to keep down costs and to compete more easily abroad.   A widerchoice of machines, of both home and foreign manufacture, shouldhe available to the machine user.3
Schools.7.     The educational &quot;benefits of decimalisation have always &quot;been regarded as an important reason for making the change.    Much time inprimary schools is devoted to teaching children the specialrules of money arithmetic^   When a child has learned the &quot;basicdecimal processes of addition, subtraction, multiplication anddivision, he has to learn different methods for dealing with moneysums; the process is tedious, time-consuming and lacking inintellectual excitement.   When we have a decimal currency,teaching time will be saved and text books will be simplified^Some of the early disenchantment with mathematics often experienced&quot;by school children may be avoided, and the change will fit inwell with changes already taking place in mathematics teaching.Educationalists, in their evidence to the Halsbury Committee,stressed, however, that the full benefits of a decimal currencywould only be obtained in conjunction with a full metric systemof weights and measures a80     In iay 19659 the President of the Board of Trade announcedthat the Government considered it desirable that British industries on a broadening front should adopt metric units, sector by sector,until that system can &quot;become in time the primary system of weights and measures for the country as a whole.   Within the next tenyears a large part of industry will therefore be making thechange to the metric system.,   This reinforces the case fordecimalisation of the currency.,   Indeed, each change increases theadvantages of the other and, taken together, they should helpexports because most of our overseas markets already use the .metric system and have decioal currencies^k
yaasuring the savings9.    The benefit6 described in paragraphs 5 to 8 will undoubtedly lead to substantial savings of time and effort in offices,banks, shops and schools.   Although these savings are important, there is no easy way of expressing them in money terms.So far as office work is concerned, the Institute of OfficeManagement told the Halsbury Committee that they believed it likely that the cost of the change-over in offices would berecouped in savings within a year or so from the date of thechange.   For schools, the saving in mathematics teaching timefor the 6 to 11 age group has been estimated at roughly 5% to 10%or 2% of total teaching time.   But decimalisation will not. reducethe number of clerks, still less the number of teachers;it will simply mean that those we have are employed more effectively.Many of the benefits of decimalisation will make themselvesfelt in the same way as productivity or technical changes - diffusedover the economy, not always easy to identify, but none the less of great practical significance.   Experience in South Africahas confirmed that the benefits expected of decimalisation can beachieved in practice.   The Report for 1965/66   of the AustralianDecimal Currency Board points out that, after less than five monthsexperience, many organisations already claim to be enjoying thebenefits.rJ5
CONFIDENTIAL -       278III THE CHOICE OF SYSTEMI  and the 10s. systemsThe Government considers that it would be wrong to let controversyrthe choice of system delay the introduction of a decimal currency,ecially now that the advantages of the switch are generally accepted.Report of the Halsbury Committee  weighs the merits of 25terns, four of them in detail,,   However, the Committee sooniided that the final choice must lie between the  -cent-  andi,-cent systems.   Informed opinion in the main agrees., The Committee4s analysis of the advantages and disadvantagesthese rival systems is long and authoritative.   It is clearlom the Report itself and from the discussion which  followeds publication that neither system is ideal and that there arejrong arguments on both sides.   In the Governments view, however,e practical advantages of retaining the familar   tip the scalescisively in favour of the   system.     The decision was only madeter full consideration of the arguments for the 1Os. system, and,object to the final approval of Parliament, it is a firmhe. No completely new evidence has come to light since the Halsbury report, in view of the public interest and some continuing misunder-tanding of the case for the   system, it may be helpful to set outhe arguments which led the Government to its conclusion.i2,  Many people have assumed that the Governments decision forjthe   system was based primarily on the &apos; international case;Indeed, some assume that this is the only argument for the   system,peither assumption is true.
0,   The Government&apos;s view ie that   the &quot;internationalcase&apos; ie important,   though not in itself decisive.     But there are other important arguments for retaining the  , arguments which are more obvious and concerned with sterling as the domestic currency of the United Kingdom rather than as an international currency.   Whenadded to the &quot;international case these point clearly to the choice ofthe   system.   They are described first in this Chapter;    the&quot;international case&apos; is described in paragraphs 31 to 33.Drawbacks of changing the major unit1U.    A change in the value of the major currency unit is a much morefar-reaching step than a change in the subsidiary units and carrieswith it certain inevitable disadvantages.   The more advanced thesociety, the more important some of these disadvantages are.     Thereis a sharp break in continuity with the past, and a considerablevolume of financial and accounting records and statistics &apos; has tobe changed.   Any comparison with the past involves the conversion of past accounts and records;   this is a disadvantage which is notmerely transitional but stretches well into the future.   During thechange-over there is no doubt that the retention of the   will bea big help to many sections of commerce and industry and that, as aresult, there will be substantially lower account conversioncosts than under a system with a different major unit.A &apos;heavy&apos; major unit15.  we in the United Kingdom are accustomed to an unusually high-value major unit.   This 1 heavy&apos; unit has advantages in a highly developed industrial and trading economy where so many moneytransactions are large ones expressed wholly or mainly in major units.Other   developed countries have major units of lower value but it isdoubtful whether, if they were starting afresh with a new system, theywould deliberately choose &apos;light&apos; units.     The lower the valueof the major unit, the greater the proliferation of large numbers insuch documents as national and company accounts.   There can be little doubt that the higher the value of the units in a currency system,subject to adequate provision for small purchases, the more efficientthat system is.     Small numbers are easier to&quot;reckon with than largeones and enable more effective use to be made of machine capacity.
CONFIDENTIAL -        280iislnes8 machine considerations^  Business machine considerations are important in the transitions well as in the long-term.    Large manufacturers of some of theiain types of business machines - cash registers, adding machines andccounting machines - have stressed that, because the 10s. systemakes less efficient use of machine capacity, the cost of conversiono such a system would he greater than conversion to the   system,ven taking into account the need under the latter system to providei half cent (half new penny) on some machines.lasting systemj.   It is important to introduce a decimal currency system which111 endure; it must remain an efficient system if possible fori very long time, not merely for a few years or decades.   Theisefulness and significance of currency units change   over the years.[his is not merely because of price inflation.   Even with stabletrices the practical importance of a given unit tends to become less asstandards of living rise and it represents an ever decreasingproportion of the average income.   The   system will need a halftent (half new penny) coin, which is admittedly a blemish on aiecimal system.   But, with growing prosperity, this coin will eventuallythereIJiisappear and/will then be no significant respect in which the   system can be said to be inferior to the 10s. system.I8.   Given this inevitable erosion of the importance of currencyunits it is the Government&apos; s view that there would have to bepowerful reasons to justify a switch to a major unit only half thefalue of the present  .   The majority Report of the Halsburyvommittee stresses that halving the value of the major unit by adopting a 10s. system &quot;seems to go against the economic logie of ,jhistory&quot; and it is difficult to deny that this is so.laming the major unit^   One important difficulty of the 10s. system is avoided under;he   system;  that of finding a name acceptable to the public8
for a new major unit.    This is not a main reason for keeping the  , hut it is a useful benefit from adecision reached on other grounds.   Correspondence in the Press,and the experience of other countries, have illustrated the lackof any obvious name and the controversy which new names can provoke.Naming the minor unit20.   The problem of finding a name for the minor unit arises under both  and 10s. systems.   Australia and New Zealand are calling theirminor unit a &quot;cent&apos;, no doubt partly because they decided to call theirmajor unit a dollar.   The advantages of this name are that it isshort, defines its own value in relation to the major unit, and iseasily distinguishable from the present penny, thus avoidingpossible confusion during the transitional period.   But there is evidence, from letters received by the Government or published inthe Press, that &apos;cent would not be a popular name in this countryand it would be a pity if, by giving the minor unit an unpopularname, the Government made decimalisation of the currency less acceptable.21.   The obvious alternative name is &apos;penny&apos; .   &apos;Penny&apos; is a namewith a long history - for many years, as a silver piece, it was our only official coin - and most people would be sorry to see it lostas the name for a current coin.   The Government proposes, therefore,that the minor unit be called a &quot;new penny&apos; during the change-everperiod, to avoid confusion with the present penny, and that theadjeetive *new&apos; should be gradually dropped thereafter,22.   in a decimal system it is neither necessary nor desirable togive names to other coins.   We want a straightforward decimal system with a major unit of account sub-divided into a hundred minor, unitsof account.   There is no advantage in continuing to call the florinby that name when it becomes a 10 new penny piece, and to call the 5 new penny  piece a shilling would be confusing.   We shall therefore have a &apos; -new penny&apos; system not a &apos; -florin-new penny&apos;
10system.   Subject to this, precise methods by which amounts of money should be expressed both orally and in writing will be investigated by the Decimal Currency Board (see paragraph 60 below) and announced in due course.lAssociability&apos; : the   as a measure of value23.   Much of the case for a 10s. system turns on the importanceduring the transitional period of what the Halsbury Committee called&apos;associability&apos; .   This  refers not only to the ease with which itis possible to translate sums of money from   s. d. to decimal andback but also to other factors which determine the readinesswith which the general public and the world of commerce and industry could adapt themselves to the new system.2k,   It is undeniable that the 10s. system has 1associability&apos;advantages.   These are the easy translation of shilling and penny&quot;shopping prices&apos;, the reduction in coinage changes, and the absenceof a fraction of the minor unit.   But the   system has the very important &apos;associability&apos; advantage   of retaining the familiar majorunit, which at present is the most important measure of our moneyvalues.   The 1Os. system in fact, although having an exactequivalence of shillings and tens of cents, retains not one of thepresent units of account; both the major unit and the minor unitwould be unfamiliar and people might well find this more disturbingand confusing than a system which maintains the   major unit as afamiliar point of reference.   Indeed, many might find it difficultunder a 10s. system to eradicate the   from their minds as a standard of value; there is some evidence that this has been so in countries which have changed from   s. d. to a 10s. system.   Undera   system wages and the prices of large purchases expressed onlyin terms of the major unit would be unchanged.Conversion from   s. d. to decimal25.   It is a mistake to think that people will constantly need to convert sums mentally from   s. d. into decimal and back again during
the change-over.   Dual-price labels, with both   s. d. and decimalprices clearly shown, will no doubt help the shopper.   Moreover,people will have conversion tables to consult when they wish to check a price.   Even more important, the Decimal Currency board will investigate very thoroughly all available means of publicisingthe change, making full use of modern educational and public relations techniques, and will consider the special problems ofparticular groups; school children, the old, and those such asshop assistants and bus conductors who handle cash in smalltransactions all day.   To the limited extent that mental conversionswill be necessary, therefore, full attention to training and publicity will considerable diminish their difficulty.Coinage changes26.   Fewer coinage changes are needed under a 10s. system, butideally under both   and 10s. systems four coins - the halfpenny,the penny, the threepenny bit and the half-crown - should eventually be withdrawn.   Under the   system it is also desirableto replace a fifth coin - the sixpence - since otherwise we shouldhave a 2^ new penny coin (see paragraphs hi and U2).   Moreover,during the transition, the coins to be replaced have more &apos;awkward&apos;decimal values than under a 10s. system.   These disadvantagesare real but &quot;essentially transitional.   The&apos;awkward&apos; coins (3d. at H, 6d. at 2-g- and 2s. 6d. at 12? new pence)will be withdrawn after the transition, which the Government aimsto make as short as possible.   Moreover, to let the avoidance ofcoinage changes distort the choice of system would be to let thetail wag the dog.     The right policy is to choose a sound, lasting,decimal system and then to design a coinage which is appropriate to that system and which people will find convenient in their dailytransactions.   It is worth adding that the   system requires onlyone change in our banknotes; the  1,  5 and  10 notes need not be altered.
The half new penny27.o The introduction of a half new penny is the main disadvantage of the   system.    It represents additional work when it has to be written or printed, whether it is expressed as a half or as a thirddecimal place.   And it also means an additional non-standard columnon some business machines needed for registering money values.But the half is a familiar concept to us all; no one will be puzzled&quot;by it.   Moreover, it is fair to suppose that the half new penny willnot stay for ever (see para.   17 above) and in much accounting work it will never be used.   Even in the period immediately after thechange-over, many organisations, including the banks, will ignore it for accounting purposes.   It is difficult to accept that thedifficulties of the half new penny are serious in planning a currency which should last for very many years.Cost and prices28.   Two important short-term considerations in selecting a decimalsystem are the cost of the change-over and the likelihood of pricerises springing from the replacement of currency units by others ofdifferent value.   In the Governments view there would be no significant differences between the   and 10s. systems in these respects.29.   The   system involves greater conversion costs for slotmachines and some business machines, and probably higher non-machinechange-over costs for retailers and transport undertakings - those most affected by the differences in &apos;associability&apos; for smallamounts9 including coinage changes and the use of the half newpennye   The 10s. system on the other hand involves greaterconversion costs for large numbers of business machines and highernon-machine costs for account and record conversion in banks andotherfinancial undertakings.30.   It has been argued that there would be a tendency formanufacturers and retailers to round prices up further under the  system in order to avoid the half new penny.   This is difficult
to accept, if only because the inconvenient halfpenny - less than half the value of the proposed half new penny - is still used.However, every effort will be made by the Government, with the helpj - . (\of the Decimal Currency Board, to prevent this kind of exploitation.Under the 10s. system, on the other hand, it can be argued thatthere is a risk that the near equivalence of pennies and newpennies will encourage people to regard them as the same and totranslate all penny amounts into the same number of new pennies.\  The &quot;international case for the  i     \ i&apos;31.   The &quot;international case&apos; is based upon the fact that the  sterling, besides being the domestic money of the United Kingdom, isone of the two great international currencies.   It is used by aItlarge part of the world, both for the settlement of trade debts andas a reserve currency.   About one third of the world&apos;s international trade is settled in sterling, and rather more than half of this coversItransactions in trade between third countries; the goods concerned13
never touch this country.   Sterling is also used for pricingternational pates, such as in the shipping market, while for manymodi ties the prices determined in the United Kingdom commodityfleets represent the dominant world price.   In addition, London is,e world&apos;s largest market for insurance, and many risks insuredjcally throughout the world are re-insured in London, the hulk(the business being expressed in sterling.   All these activities,gether with the banking services they involve, earn this countrylarge and growing invisible&apos; income.   Sterling also forms part of the national monetary reserves of a number of countries.   These areainly members of the Commonwealth, but many other countries alsoold sterling in their reserves, often in substantial amounts.   As aesult of all this, the   is a symbol known throughout the commercialentree of the world.\i. Witnesses from the City, including the Bank of England, theBritish Bankers9Association, the Accepting Houses and the British[nsurance Association argued before the Halsbury Oomnlttee that to change ther 3 or value of the   would jeopardize the goodwill that is embodied in it through long usage and an acceptable degree of stability over theyears; that some of those who held or used sterling might inconsequence cease to do so; and that,if this occurred when economic circumstances were otherwise unfavourable, misunderstanding of ourmotives would aggravate the situation so that the effect could be serious.   Underlying this argument is the realisation that theinternational trading and financial communities are moved not only by reason bat also by custom and habit.33, There is no doubt that a change in the major unit wouldinconvenience a lot of sterling users who are not concerned withthe domestic arguments for decimalisation.   Equally it would be idleto claim that a change could benefit the international standing of sterling;   if there were any effect at all it might prove to be an adverse one.
Summary of the arguments34.   To sum up, the choice between the   and 10s. systems involvesbalancing many different considerations.   To select either system is to pose for some sections of the community problems which theywould not face - or would not face to the same degree - if thealternative were chosen.   But the decision which the Government hastaken is based on the view that the benefits of the   system are on balance greater now, and that they are significantly so in thelong term because most of the advantages of the 10s. system relatesolely to the fairly short transitional period.   The important thingis for all those organisations affected by the change-over, whatever their views on the choice of- system, ts-play their full part in carrying out the plans for the change-over in theinterests of the country as a whole.
CONFIDENTIAL 2 8 iv THE COINAGEle Halsbury Committee&apos;s viewsft.   The Halsbury Committee made recommendations about thesnominations and specifications of coins to be used with a decimalnrrency based on the  -new penny system.   They did this afterareful consideration of all the factors and consultation with aariety of interests, including banks, retailers and others whoandle cash in bulk, manufacturers of coin-operated machines, andirganisations representing women, the consumer, and the blind.16.   Just as it is impossible to choose a decimal system which willilease everyone, so it is impossible to design a coinage which allInterests will find equally satisfactory.    In the Government&apos;s view the Halsbury Committee&apos;s proposals come near to achieving the bestbalance.   With one important exception the coins described belowfollow the Committee&apos;s recommendations.Choice of denominations7.   Two considerations govern the choice of coin denominations, x,They should be in a simple relationship to one another so thatpayments may be made and change given easily for any amount.   Theyshould also be chosen to enable transactions to be conducted withthe smallest practicable total number of coins in circulation.This in effect means a compromise between excessive numbers of oneor two low-value coins, and an equally undesirable proliferationof denominations.   The following sequence of coins or banknotes,recommended by the Halsbury Committee, comes nearest to meeting these requirements:  new penny (1 .2d) 10 new pence (2s.)1 new penny (2.Ud) 20 new pence (hs.)2 new pence (U.8d) 50 new pence (10s.)5 new pence (1s.)  1 (unchanged)The Halsbury Committee recommended the provision of bronze      1 and
2 coins and cupro-nickel 5, 10 and 20 coins; a 50 note would ultimately replace the 10 shilling note and the remaining hanknotes would be unchanged.The problems of distinguishability v38.   There is less freedom for manoeuvre in selecting coin sizesand specifications than might at first appear.   Apart from the obvious fact that there are upper and lower limits to the sizeslikely to be acceptable to the public, coins of different valuescirculating together have to be readily distinguishable from one another by sight, by touch, and by machine (coin-sorting machines and slot machines of all types).   The position is complicated bythe fact that at least some of the   s. d. coins have to circulatealongside the new decimal coins during a transitional period, evenif this is short.   The Halsbury Committee made two furtherrecommendations which impose restrictions^ that all coins shouldbe round, and, more important, that the weight/value relationshipwithin the present cupro-nickel coinage should be retained and asimilar relationship provided within the bronze coinage.Shaped coins39.   The present twelve-sided threepenny bit is a Shaped1  coin andit has always had its critics on aesthetic grounds.   A few countries have square coins or coins with scalloped edges.   But round coinsare traditional and popular in this country and it is difficult to select a shape which would be readily accepted as being bothattractive and functional.   And   there are practical objections asI well as aesthetic ones; it is difficult to provide efficient andj economical slot machines to take shaped coins.kO.   At present the value of a mixed bag of cupro-nickel coins canbe assessed by weighing because, for example, the florin weighstwice as much as the shilling and four times as much as thesixpence.   This weight/value relationship is of considerable17
assistance to those organisations which handle coins in bulk - banks,the Post Office, large stores, and transport undertakings.   Itsabandonment would involve increased costs for coin sorting.   In theGovernments view the Halsbury Committee were right to recommend the retention of this useful practical feature  in the cupre-nickelcoinage and its introduction into the bronze coinage.The bronze coins41 ,   The Government accepts the Halsbury Committee recommendations for      1 and 2 new penny coins in bronze, slightly larger thanold silver threepenny piece, the farthing, and the halfpennyrespectively.   Three questions which may be asked are:(i)   Would a 2? new penny coin, exactly the same size, weightand value as the sixpence, be preferable to a 2 new pennycoin?(ii)   Would a small cupro-nickel 2 new penny coin be preferable to a fairly hig bronze one?(iii)   Will a coin as small as the half new penny be acceptable?The sixpence42.   The sixpence is a popular coin both with the general public and the slot machine industry.   But a 2% new penny coin is an awkward denomination and experiments have shown that fractionalcoins make change-giving slower and more prone to error.   InSouth Africa the previously popular threepenny bit became unpopularas a decimal 2? cent piece.   Very few countries have 2  cent pieces;many have popular 2 cent pieces.The 2 new penny piece43.   A smaller 2 new penny piece in cupro-nickel is ruled outbecause in the transitional period it would have to circulate withthe sixpence and would undoubtedly be confused with it if provided in weight/value relationship with other cupro-nickel coins.Small bronze coins44.   The bronze half new penny piece will be small but no smaller than common and popular low-value coins in other countries.   Indeed,
it is bigger than several such coins.   One widespread criticism of our present bronze coins is that they are much too large and heavy for their modest value.    They already cost more than theirface value to produce.   The introduction of weight/valuerelationship in the bronze coinage limits the choice of sizes; ifthe half new penny becomes bigger, so does the 2 new penny coin.There is a further practical point;  even a slight increase in the size of the   and 1 new penny coins would allow the dishonest touse them in most of the sixpenny and shilling slots of gas and electricity meters.The 5 and 10 new penny pieces45.   The 5 and 10 new penny denominations are exact translations ofthe shilling and the florin, the only   s. d. coins which fit intothe decimal sequence.   Shillings and florins evoke very littleadverse criticism now and, if the weight/value relationship stays,there is little point in changing their specification and therebyadding considerably to slot machine conversion costs.    Indeed, theretention of these familiar coins at familiar values will be a greathelp to the public during the change-over.A 20 new penny piecekS.   The Halsbury Committee recommended the provision of a cupro-nickel 20 new penny coin (Us.) in weight/value relationship to the5 and 10 new penny pieces and thus a very large   coin - the samesize as the double-florin which was introduced for &quot;Queen Victoria&apos;sgolden jubilee in 1887 but which never found public favour.   Inthis recommendation the Committee were influenced by a desire on theone hand to provide a coin of higher value than 10 new pence (2s.)and on the other hand to avoid a coinage with three tiers of metal.considerBulk coin handling.organisations/three-tier systems inferior tosystems with only twa hirers ef-Tnetal-with a weighs/value relation-ship in each tier.   In the Governments view the verylarge 2- new penny coin would not be popular.   Moreover,as there is no generally circulating coin
in this value range now it is by no means clear that one is neededunder a decimal system.   It is not therefore proposed to include a20 new penny piece among the new decimal coins.    If demand for itshould grow, such a coin could be provided later.aj?0 new penny pieceU7-   The 10 shilling note is popular hut its life is very short.On economic grounds there is a strong case for replacing it by a50 new penny coin instead of a 50 new penny banknote; a coin ismuch more expensive to produce but has a life of at least 50 years(after which the metal is recoverable) whereas the note has a life of only about five months and the costs of distributing replacementnotes and withdrawing worn ones are considerable.liB.   One disadvantage of a 50 new penny coin is that it makes athree-tier coinage inescapable if we maintain weight/valuerelationship in each tier and keep within sensible sizelimits.   However, it is the Government&apos;s view that anelegantly designed 50 new penny piece would be popular aswell as economically sound and they propose to introduce one.It would be significantly different from the other white coins.Several countries have recently introduced high-value coins inroughly this value range, and most seem to be popular.   TheGovernment are giving further consideration to the specificationof this coin and the timing of its introduction; details will be announced later.Banknotesk9*   Apart from the eventual disappearance of the 10 shilling note,no changes in the denominations, specifications or designs of ourbanknotes are necessary under a  -new penny decimal system..The halfpenny50.   The decimal coinage proposed above gives a lowest value coinof 1 .2d as compared with the present halfpenny.   The HalsburyCommittee, after considerable research into the use made of the
coin and the effect of its withdrawal, unanimously recommendedthat no coin equivalent or roughly, equivalent to the halfpennyshould he provided in a decimal system.   The halfpenny is stillused in the prices of some goods, including a few staple food items.But, measured by the frequency of its appearance both in price listsand in the total purchases of sample households, it has for someyears been steadily declining in use.   The purchasing power ofthe halfpenny is less than half that of the farthing in 191 h. andit has a practical significance much smaller still because of the greatly increased standard of living since that date.51 .   If a i new penny coin were introduced it would give a coinworth rather more than the halfpenny (0.6d); if a  -mil system were introduced it would give a coin worth almost the same as the oldfarthing (0.2hd).   But either the  -new penny system with a i or the -rail system would present people with considerable difficultiesbecause of the cumbersome method of expressing amounts - and wouldhave machine disadvantages.   Both are markedly inferior to the -new penny system with a -jr, and the Government considers that it wouldbe undesirable to select either of them for introduction in 1971when even now the halfpenny is of limited and declining use.Withdrawal of   a, d. coins52.   The Government&apos;s intention is to accept the recommendation ofthe Halsbury Committee that, to avoid confusion during the change-over, the halfpenny should be demonetised and withdrawn beforehand,probably in 1970.   It has not yet been decided when the other four  s. d. coins which do not have equivalents in the decimal coinagewill be demonetised (1d, 3d, 6d and 2/6d - see paragraph 26).The Decimal Currency Board will consider the phasing of thesecoinage changes in consultation with the Royal Mint and other interested organisations.Summary of coinage proposals53.   The Government therefore proposes to introduce the followingdecimal coins:21
Denomination			Value	Metal	Edge	Diameter	Weight1 2	new	penny-	1 .2d	&quot;bronze	plain	(centimetres) 1 .7145	(grammes) 1 .78201	new	penny	2.Ud	bronze	plain	2.0320	3.56402	new	pence	4.8d	bronze	plain	2.5910	7.12805	new	pence	1s.	cupro-nickel	milled	2.3595 (shilling size and weight)	5.655210	new	pence	2s.	cupro-nickel	milled	2.8500 (florin size and weight)	11 .310450	new	pence	10s.	(to	be announced later)		The first five of these recommended coins follow the Halsburyproposals;     the 50 new penny piece is proposed in place of thelarge cupro-nickel Halsbury 20 new penny piece. The Appendixgives a chart comparing the sizes of these decimal coins withthose of our   s. d. coins.The Halsbury specifications were expressed in inches and grains;they have been expressed here in metric measurements, consistent with the Government&apos;s declared policy on the metric system.22
V THE CHANGE-OVERBroad time-table5k.   The change-over to decimal currency will take place inFebruary 1971. almost five years from the date of the Governmentannouncement on 1st March this year.Change-over date55.   On a day yet to be determined in February 1971. therefore,the decimal currency will become the country&apos;s official currency.The banks will adopt decimal working, as will probably mostGovernment departments and many non-Government organisations.Decimal coins will appear for the first time and will be needed topay for purchases in some shops.   February has been selected, onthe advice of the Halsbury Committee, as the slackest time of theyear for banks, retailers and transport undertakings.Transitional period56.   A clean nation-wide overnight switch from   s. d. to decimalworking is, however, impracticable.   So far, when countries havemade the change to a decimal system, they have found it necessaryto have a transitional period of dual-currency working.   It isimpossible to convert or replace all business machines which record  s. d. on one day.   As they wait for their cash registers and othermachines to be decimalised, therefore, some shops and offices willcontinue to price things in   s. d.     Both old and new coins willcirculate together.   This period of dual-currency working involves. a lot of extra work for many organisations, particularly the banks,and may well be confusing for the public.   It is clearly desirable tohave as short a transitional period as possible.   This is largelywhy the Government decided to have a long preparatory period;   ifthis preparatory period is used to full advantage the transitioncan be kept short - perhaps much shorter than the two years whichthe Halsbury Committee considered probable.     It will be one of themain tasks of the Decimal Currency Board to study ways of reducingthe length and problems of the transitional period.
liprgparatory pet-ledI57,   The preparatory period has already started.   The first tasle. have been to determine the new coinage, and to settle the organisational arrangements for the change-over.   The key body inthe change-over will be the Decimal Currency Board,  which willbe appointed shortly.580   The two largest physical tasks of the preparatory period -tasks mainly responsible for determining its length and stretchingalso over the transitional period - will be, first, the minting of almost 9.000 million decimal coins to replace the   s. d. ones,I and, second, the work resulting from the need to replace orconvert to decimal working between 2 and 2i million businessmachines, mainly cash registers, adding and accounting machines,and about the same number of slot machines, including Post Officetelephone coin boxes.   The Royal Mint have already embarked on thepreparatory work for producing the coins and have announced apublic competition to find suitable designs.   The business machineindustry has also begun planning.59*   As the preparatory period progresses a big campaign of publiceducation will be launched.   Preparatory work, including the alteration of records, the revision of price structures, theproduction of new stationery, dual-price ticketing and stafftraining, will take up much time in shops and offices.   If the precedent of other countries is followed the banks will be closedf for a long weekend before the change-over to enable them to change their machines and accounting system, epimal.....Currency Board60.   All this preparatory work will be co-ordinated by the decimal currency Board in close consultation with Government departments.The functions of the Board will be as follows:(1)   to examine in detail the problems of the change-overincluding consultation as appropriate with interested parties;
(2)    to promote the speedy and efficient transition to the useof decimal currency;(3)    to organise a programme of guidance to the public;(h)   to examine any claims for $compensation (within theGovernments broad policy on the subject), and to make recommendations thereon,wing the early months of its life the Board will be mainlyadvisory;    it will later assume a more marked executive andco-ordinating role.si.   One major task of the Board will be to discuss with thebusiness machine Industry the problems of conversion and replacement of machines.   In this they will have the specialistsupport of a group of engineers.   The Government intends that oneBoard member shall be a qualified professional engineer able togive particular attention to machine problems.62.   The Government will await the advice of the Board before deciding on the precise change-over date in February 1971* thelength of the transitional period, and the other difficult issues which will need to be resolved.The cost63.   The Halsbury Committee estimated the 9measurable&apos; cost ofdecimalisation in 1970 at  128 million;    they made no estimate for 1971*   &quot;Measurable&apos; costs are those for converting or replacingbusiness machines and slot-machines, coinage costs, thespecial bank costs, and the costs of publicity and central administration.   Much the largest single item in the Halsburyestimate -  80 million - is for business machines.6k.   The Government is satisfied that the Halsbury figures,, asthe Committee themselves pointed out, are too high rather than too low.   The minting costs will be greater but the costs for convertingbusiness machines will be lower.   The machine companies have hadvaluable experience in the Australian change-over and in planning the
Hew Zealand change-over.   Government experts will collaborate with the companies in this country with the aim of taking full advantage of experience elsewhere to discover the conversion methodsoffering best value-for-money to machine users.   The longpreparatory period should also enable users to plan their machinepurchases in such a way as to minimise decimalisation costs.compensation65*   In the Government&apos;s view those organisations which will haveto incur substantial change-over costs are in the main those whichstand to benefit most from the change in the long run.   compensation as a general principle is not acceptable.   Indeed, it may militateagainst an efficient and economical change-over.   If it can be shown to the Decimal Currency Board, however, that there aregrounds for giving some assistance in special cases the Governmentwill consider any recommendations the Board may care to make.But such cases, if there are any at all, will be exceptional.Legislation66.   The Government will be bringing forward for the approval ofParliament a Bill to establish the new decimal currency units and totake certain other necessary powers.
