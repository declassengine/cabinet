DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)PUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1967-68Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer attach a report by the Ministerial Committee on public expenditure on the results of the exercise which has been carried outfollowing the Cabinet&apos;s instructions on 10th August.    This report dealswith 1967-68;  we shall subsequently deal with expenditure in later years in the light of studies being made of the economic prospect up to, 1970.2.       The starting point for our work was a paper by officials setting out a range of alternatives, with no programmes excepted, to enable usto consider how best the claims of departments could be limited to the planned rate of growth of A\ per cent.     The figures used in this paper were based on the main June PESC report since when substantial.further expenditure has been approved or contemplated (Annexes A-C of the ministerial Committee*s Report).     This too has had to be taken intoaccount.3.       The Public Expenditure Committee have considered departments&apos;programmes, item by item, at a series of meetings over the past threeweeks and in the case of the major spending departments we have discussed the position with our colleagues.4.       The general approach we have taken to these questions is set outin our Report, but it may be helpful here to summarise our main guide-lines.    What we have tried to do is to contain the rate of increase ofpublic expenditure.    In 1966-67 public expenditure is likely to be atleast 4 per cent at constant prices higher than in 1965-66;  and it will rise by over 8 per cent at constant prices in 1967-68 over this yearunless it is curtailed.    This increase in public expenditure has beensolely in civil expenditure because defence expenditure has been held;and of course the increases in civil expenditure have been much faster thanoutlays in the rest of the economy.    It is important to recognise theshift which has already taken place in the use of resources between theprivate and public sectors,5.       It has seemed to us that our emphasis should now be turningfrom increasing public expenditure every year to deciding whether ourpresent priorities are the best ones and those to which the Cabinetattaches the highest importance.    We are financing the shift of resources by increasing taxation each year and by damping down anygeneral increase in the level of private consumption.    But we need to keep the balance here.C(66)158COPY NO.11th November, 1966CABINET
6.       We have also to consider the consequences for our general economic policies of allowing an excessive rise in public expenditure,for if we were to permit this we should find when the time comes forreflation that we have tied our hands and limited our room for manoeuvre.We have already in the last few weeks found it necessary to take actionto limit the fall in private fixed investment which has been taking place to an extent going beyond our intentions in July.7.      In August the Cabinet took the view, and this was reinforced bythe decision of the Labour Party Conference, that when reflationbecomes possible the first priority should be given to expenditure whichwill directly benefit productivity, exports and import saving.    But thesituation with which the Committee were confronted was an increase in programmes of public expenditure which would have amounted to a rise of over 8 per cent next year.8.       The increase programmes for 1967-68 proposed by Departmentsamount to  1, 037 million.    An increase of 4;j per cent on the 1966-67figure would mean a rise next year of  526 million.    The differencebetween these two figures represents a reduction in the rate of increaseof  511 million.    This report contains agreed recommendations for reductions in proposed increases totalling about  277 million.    We arenow inviting the Cabinet to endorse these recommendations.    In the major fields of transport, education, health and welfare and social security our proposals are made after discussion with the ministers concerned, though I should make it clear that those Ministers are not committed by our recommendations.     The other reductions which we propose have not been discussed with the Departmental ministers responsible though our proposal that Black Arrow should be cancelledtakes account of what we were told about discussion in the ministerial committee on Science and Technology.9.       None of us likes making these proposals.    We are clear,however, that for the reasons set out in paragraph 4 to 8 of the report we cannot contemplate the rate of increase that would result if theprogramme went forward without change.10.       If all these reductions are approved by the Cabinet the rate of increase from 1966-67 to 1967-68 will still be of the order of 5. 8 percent at constant prices, and 9-10 per cent at current prices.    we recognise that, in a year of pensions uprating it may be reasonable togo ahead a little faster than in other years;  but I should not like mycolleagues to under-rate the danger of adverse reactions to confidence,from a rate of increase as high as this.11.       In our figures for public expenditure in 1967-68 we have allowed 50 million for &quot;additional programmes&quot; which are still under examination.     The candidates for inclusion in this category alreadytotal  92 million and are listed in Annex 3 of the Report.    Oncedecisions on the proposals in the Public Expenditure Committee&apos;sReport have been agreed, we shall have to turn our attention to theseproposals for additional expenditure.    The main candidates areadditional housing investment and provision for child poverty.
12.       The Minister of Housing and Local Government has drawn our attention to the fact that private sector housing starts have fallen awaysharply since July.    Public sector starts in 1967 are expected to total220,000 houses.    If private starts in 1967 fall below 190,000 whichthe Minister of Housing regards as quite possible, total completions in 1968 could be no better, or even lower, than the 400, 000 houses or so that are now expected to be completed in 1967.    It is argued that, ifwe can do no better than this in 1968, our chances of achieving 500,000houses by 1970 are small.    In order to make good the shortfall incompletions in the private sector in 1968 which he fears the Minister of housing now proposes an additional 15, 000 starts in the public sector in1967-68.13.       The Ministerial Committee on Public Expenditure discussed thisproposal with the Minister of Housing.    It was pointed out that the 1970target of 500,000 houses was under review, both in relation to housing needs and in relation to revised forecasts of the rate of economic growth.If that target were to be revised, the case for injecting additional startsinto the public sector in 1967-68 would be diminished.    Moreover, someof us thought that it would be premature to take action now on theassumption that private sector housing will not revive over the next 12months.    The prospect of the option mortgage scheme, and the easementof restrictions on credit for bridging finance, are among the factors which could well contribute to a revival in private sector housing, whichall our experience shows to be highly volatile.    The majority of theCommittee on Public Expenditure therefore took the view that a decisionon the Minister of housing s proposal should not be taken for the timebeing, and that at this stage no provision should be made for additionalstarts in 1967-68 on public sector housing investment.    This is a matterupon which further discussion outside Cabinet is unlikely to get us anyfurther, and I ask the Cabinet to accept the majority view.14,      So far as provision for child poverty is concerned, Ministers willbe aware of the comprehensive report that has been prepared by theOfficial Committee on Social Services.    This will need to be further discussed by the Committee on Public Expenditure and by the ministerial committee on Social Services before a decision is taken by the Cabinet,I recognise that there is a real problem in relation to the group of about150,000 families who for one reason and another are around or belowthe supplementary benefits level but do not qualify for them.    i recognise that it would be easier to present increases in charges for school meals and welfare milk if at the same time we were doingsomething for those families.    I could support proposals for a scheme,which I recognise would have to include a means test, which channelled,say,  10 million of additional benefit directly to those particularfamilies.    I do not, however, believe that it would be practicable tointroduce any of the more wide-ranging schemes which have beendiscussed in the course, of 1967-68, and I am so far unconvinced thatany of these more wide-ranging schemes could be regarded as consistent with the very limited scope we have for increasing public expenditure on social benefits in the next three years.    I also consider that the balanceof political advantage will need careful thought.    The Lord President ofthe Council^ however, thinks that we should not queer the pitch for a comprehensive family endowment scheme later on by minor adjustmentsnext year.    He would therefore prefer not to introduce the sort of limited scheme to which I have referred, and not to raise charges for school meals or welfare milk, in the meantime.    The Lord President
and the Minister without Portfolio have now set out their views onthese matters in more detail in memoranda which are being circulated for consideration by the Cabinet.    I remain of the view that it wouldnot be practicable to work out and introduce any wide ranging scheme in 1967-68.    I accordingly ask the Cabinet to approve these charges from September, 1967, subject to working out a satisfactory schemecosting about  10 million to help the families to which I have already referred.15.       The other proposals for additional expenditure we can pursuethrough the ordinary interdepartmental channels and, if necessary, inthe Ministerial Committee on Public Expenditure,    What we must nowdo very quickly, since time is running out for the preparation of estimates, is to take decisions on the proposals in the report by the ministerial Committee on Public Expenditure which is attached tothis memorandum.16.       Our public commitment has been to 4^ per cent increase overthe period 1964-70: next year this would mean a rise of  526 million.The proposals put forward in the Public Expenditure Report would themselves represent an increase of  720 million i. e. 5. 8 per cent.While the Cabinet will no doubt wish to consider these proposalsindividually I would ask my colleagues to recognise the narrow limitswithin which our decisions must now be reached,l. j. c.Treasury Chambers, S.Wml,11th November, 1966
PUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1967-68-  At its meeting on August 10th (C .C. (66)h3rd Meeting) theCabinet gave instructions that officials were to draw up a.list of items (without making recommendations) which wouldhave the effect of keeping the Increase in expenditure in1967-685 as compared, with 1966-67. within the planned rateof hi per cento    The Cabinet also laid it down that no programme was to be excepted, from this examination..    Officials have reported and. we have examined, their list of possibilities;    inaddition we have taken Into account increases of no less than 16? million in public expenditure which have been authorised since june (see Annex A).   Beyond these there are still further proposals for increased expenditure in 1967-68 totalling  92 million.2.     The situation with which we started, may be outlined as&apos; follows: -Total public expenditureestimate for comparison)m.i2,372Comparison with1966-67  m.%1967-68 Basic programmes in mainPESC Report, June 1966less 20th July savingsIncrease already agreed (Annex A)Further proposals under examination13,2338313515016713,3179213,U09* 861+ 7784- 9k5+1 037i 7.0+ 6.3+ 7.6+ 8.23.We are therefore dealing with large increases in expenditureicxt year, and not with &quot;cuts&quot;.or c omparIson, maintcnanc e of astrict hi per cent,  increase would mean a rise next year of 526 million).    The central questions with which we have had to&apos;  whfdeal are, first, at what rate can public expenditure be safelyincreased, next year, in the light of the nations economic prospectand., second, where reductions might best bethe priority for increasing the nation?staken as a whole:made, bearing in mindeconomic strength which was expressed in the resolution carried atthe Party Conference.Desirable level ofmpublic.....expenditureho     The percentage rates of increase shown in the table do not give us any firm lead by themselves, though they have&apos; somepresentational significance in relation to &quot;hi per cent.&quot; statements made in the Plan and on other occasions by the Prime Minister andthe Chancellor.    Our main guide must be the relation of the increasein public expenditure to the prospect for the economy as a whole.1 0
5.     Wc cannot at this stage he certain that the degree ofdeflation we set in train in July will prove to he righto    Itis fairly clear that deflation is proceeding faster than we expected, but that does not mean that it is going to run away.It is obviously possible that at some stage we shall want to relax somewhat.,    It would be quite wrong to conclude, however,that the way to do this is to let Government expenditure in 1967-68rise as much as it now seems likely to do.   We have said that whenthe time comes to moderate the deflation and prepare for an up-turn, we shall want to look first at private productive investment,that we want to avoid setting off a consumer boom and that socialexpenditures may temporarily have to take second place.   This maymean that our first actions would bo in the field of credit and investment incentives;    and we should not prejudice such action by decidingnow on increases in Government expenditure which would take up allthe slack we are likely to be able to afford.60     We must also remember that many decisions in the field ofexpenditure set in train upward trends which are not easy to reverse - the difficulties we have experienced in our attempts to restrain the growth of expenditure on various occasions over thepast two years are evidence of this.    This point is of particular importance at the present time, when we are facing the strongprobability that the growth in the economy between now and 1970, willbe very much less than we had expected.    This may well mean that we   -shall have to phase back the rate of rise of a number of expenditure programmes, and we should net make this process more difficult by allowing substantial rises to take place now.7.     Finally there is the strong possibility that between now andthe end of 1967-68 we shall have to consider further proposals for increases in expenditure, some of which may be of higher prioritythan existing programmes.    The fact that between July and Octoberadditional expenditure of no less than  16? million was approved(see Annex A) shows what can happen.8.     For all these reasons we believe it to be necessary to   adopta cautious approach now, so as to hold back the increase in public expenditure enough to ensure that freedom of manoeuvre is left tomeet these possible developments.    If we fail to restrain public expenditure sufficiently now, we might well find ourselves forcedto make unplanned checks of the kind we imposed in July 1965 and july I966.   We believe our colleagues will agree that this is amost unsatisfactory type of action which we must do our best toavoid.9&quot;     Dg gPLQ.g,&quot;    The Chancellor of the Exchequer has proposed andthe Committee agrees that a reduction of  50 million should be madein next year&apos;s Defence Estimates;    the Secretary of State for defence is at present considering how a reduction of this order might beachieved.10.   Civil,defence.   We propose a reduction of  1.7 million.Moreover, we recommend that officials be instructed to keep totalcivil defence expenditure (including expenditure on the Home defence force) within a total next year of  22 million, i.e. the same as thisyear, and that if possible they should secure a lower total fort hewhole of this expenditure.2.
1&quot;1&quot;    Overseas inforaation.    A reduction of  k.5 million is proposed for next year.    The balance between this and reductions in defence expenditure may need to be examined;    if large reductions in thelatter are secured there may be a case for not reducing expenditureon overseas information by so much.\z.    Roads.     Reductions in improvements of minor roads and car parks and in the maintenance of minor roads will make possible a reductionof  6.2 million and this we recommend (this applies to Great britain as a whole).    Adjustments in expenditure on major road programmescannot be met at short notice without undesirable effects on the orderly progress of construction because of the long planning periodsinvolved.    This is apart from the difficulty of assessing the realeconomic benefits of given levels of expenditure.    When public expenditure comes to be examined in the longer term, we believe thatthis aspect of the road programme will need to be further examined.13o    Railway deficit.    The deficit next year will be  25 million higher than was forecast earlier, largely as a result of declines intraffic following the measures of July 20th.    The total next year islikely to be over  130 million, roughly the same as in the presentyear.   We believe that a reduction of  5 million should be possible by increasing charges after the period of severe restraint on price increases has ended.&apos;&apos;^0    Agriculture.    A saving of  2.7 million will result from delay in the passage of the Agriculture Bill.    In addition a furthersaving of  k.5 million expenditure on agriculture etc.    can ioe secured by a variety of small measures; some of which depend on the delay inthe Agriculture Bill.   Both these savings should be adopted.15&quot;   Ports.    The Minister of Transport has said that a saving of 3*5 million is practicable;    she would prefer this to any further reductions in road expenditure next year.   We have adopted herproposal.    These mean further reductions in independent portsinvestment and a small deferment of capital works on transport piersin Scotland.16.   Airports.    Savings of  1.6 million can be secured by reductions in capital expenditure on air traffic control services.^7-    Other transport.    Small reductions totalling  1 .k million can besecured by a tighter control of loan sanctions for road passenger transport investment, by postponement of starts on a ship for the highlands and Islands of Scotland, and by a small reduction in the contribution to euro control.18.   Board of Trade.   A saving of  0.2 million can be secured from various minor reductions in Board of Trade grants in aid throughthe assistance of industry and trade.Aviation.   A saving of  0.1 million will follow from a revised estimate for assistance to the aircraft industry.20.    Industrial research.    Savings of  1 .8 million can be secured bya small reduction in the rate of increase in expenditure on industrial research in the Ministry of Technology&apos;s sphere.This will still leave an increase of  10 million between the presentyear and next year.   A reduction of  1 .1 million in A.E.A.expenditure can be secured by curtailment of capital expenditure,economies in the procurement of stores, etc.;     3^5 million can befound from agreed economies and a modest change in the aeronautical research programme.    In addition it is proposed that Black Arrow3.
should be cancelled (with a saving of  2,1  million next year) ^onthe grounds that it has no military or economic advantages and thatthe possible technological advantages may be just as well secured by continued participation in ELDOo21*    Housing; subsidies and grants.    Total savings of  26.5  millioncan, we believe, be secured from the following changes.    the dropping of the publicity campaign for improved grants would enablegrants to be kept clown to the&apos; current level, with a saving of k.6 million next year.    Postponement of the owner occupier mortgagesubsidy until 1st April 1968 would lead to a saving of     1-5 million,in addition to which reductions in advances to the housing corporation for realism would yield savings of  6 million next year.There would also be a small reduction of  0.9 million in housing subsidies in Scotland:    this would bring subsidies in line with the basic subsidies for housing investment.    The Committee recommends that all these savings should be secured.    The Committee are alsoagrec-d that local authority lending for house purchase should be held,at  130 million.22.   Local authority &quot;other environmental services&quot;. A reductionof    12 &quot;million can be secured hy further restrictions in the rural water supply and sewerage schemes;    by an embargo on all newparks, pleasure grounds, etc., and by deferment of correspondingworks in Scotland.    This is all capital expenditure and is separate from the reduction of  30 million in current expenditure onMiscellaneous Environmental Services referred to in paragraph 29.23-    Police and prisons.    The Committee think that a reduction of 1 million is practicable here, mainly by postponement of work atthe Police College and delaying theintroduc tion of the schemefor a longer period of recruitment training, together with someother small modifications.Education.    The present charge for school meals is Is., thelevel at which it has remained since 1957 when it was last raised;compared -with this the economic cost is 2s. 6d.    Meals are freefor children whose parents&apos;  incomes are at or below supplementary benefit levels.   An increase of 6d. in the school meals charge,which would yield  12 million next year, could be introducedbeginning in September 1967, in order to bring the charges more closely in line with current prices.    The majority of the Committeesupported this increase in the charge of 6d. provided that some arrangement was made to improve the &quot;endowment&quot; of the poorer familiesthe situation will in any case be eased by tho new rates ofsupplementary benefit coming into force this month.    The committee did not consider that a general charge should be made for school milk;    but considered that there should be an enquiry into thepossibility of making a charge in secondary schools.25.    The Committee also believes that the present levels of somefees can be raised and that some grants and awards might be reduced.It recommends a rise in fees for evening institutes and for further education (each yielding  1.1 million in 1967-68) and for overseasstudents at universities ( 1  million).    In addition we believe itshould be possible to reduce grants for direct grant schools( 1 million)and to reduce the vacation grant and increase the parentalcontributions for students at a total saving of  8.6 million.  &quot;Thepolitical aspects of such changes will hoed consideration, as has been pointed out by the Secretary of State for Education and Science,v-e also believe that a saving of  3.8 million could be made by taking advantage of the gradual decline in teaching costs perteacher per year and in local authority expenditure onadministration, the Youth Service, community centres andtillage halls.k.
26.    Health and Welfare.    Under the present scheme,  expectant mothers and children under five get one pint of milk a day at 4d.,compared with the retail price of 9d.-10d.    Children of familieson national assistance, and some others, get the milk free.Subject to the same proviso as in the case of school meals(para. 24) we believe that an increase in the price from 4d. to 6d.,yielding  13-5 million next year, could be achieved.    This doesno more than bring the level of subsidy per pint down to about thelevel which prevailed after the present price of 4d. was fixed in1957.27.    Social security benefits.    In recent years benefits have been increased in line with the rise in earnings and the Minister of social security had proposed a rise in June 1967-    The Committee thinks thatthe next increase should take place in November 1967.    A rise in line with retail prices would mean an increase of 8s.   A rise in line with earnings would mean a rise of 1 3s. for the single pensioner (taking into account the 1s. deduction to help meet the cost of the newnon-contributorjr benefits).   Bearing in mind that the recently introduced supplementary benefits will take care of cases of hardships,the Committee considers that in the circumstances a rise of 10s.would be sound and would be defensible.    This would mean a savingnext year of  100 million.    This we recommend.28.   Administrative and j^is^eT^neoustiiservices.    This covers a wide range of buildings of various kinds and other small adjustments.We consider that a reduction of 5.6 million is practicable next year.This would allow proposed work on Government training centres andindustrial rehabilitation centres to go ahead, and some building of offices in development areas, but it would mean the postponement of purchases of land and buildings for the Bridge Street site.29o   Rate Support Grant.   As explained in paragraph 8 of the noteannexed to C7C66&quot;)152, some of the above proposals affect expenditure by local authorities, and would be reflected in adjustments of theRate Support Grant.    In addition, as proposed in paragraph k ofC(66)152, officials are seeking a further reduction of  30 million in the general provision in local Authority estimates forMiscellaneous Environmental Services.    This  30 million is separate from the other figures mentioned in this paper.    Even if it is allachieved, local authority current expenditure would still be 22 million more than foreseen in the PESC Report.30,    These proposed reductions acid up to  277 million.    Thetotal of public expenditure in 1 967-68 would therefore be 13,040 million instead of the  13,317 million shown in line k of the table in paragraph 2.     13,040 million represents&apos;an increase of5*h per cent, over 1966-67.5*

The corresponding increases implied for the Estimates arenearly 6 per cent, at constant prices and nearly 10 per cent, at current (1967) prices.34.   .
