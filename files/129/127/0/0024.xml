SALS OF BAC 1-11 AIRCRAFT TO THE INDIANAIRLINES corporation memorandum by the President of the Board of trade the Sub-Committee on External Economic Policy of the ministerial Committee on Economic Development has been unableto reach agreement on a proposal by the Minister of Aviation thatthe present limit of  20 million on officially insured business with india on credit terms in excess of five years should be waived inorder to make possible the sale of BAG 1-11 aircraft to the IndianAirlines Corporation (IAC).    As I acted as Chairman of the Sub-Committee, in the absence of the First Secretary of State, when this was discussed I am submitting this memorandum to enable theCabinet to resdve the issue.2.      The IAC will shortly need to replace its fleet of twelveViscounts.    Their choice of a replacement will probably lie betweenthe American DC-9 and the BAC 1-11 and the indications are that the bac 1-11 would be the IACts first choice.    The order would be worth 9,5 million,3.      The Indians have made it clear that they will want to makerepayments over ten years for whatever aircraft they purchase.    Itwas agreed earlier this year that ten year credit could be extended for BAC 1-11 aircraft.    The limit   of  20 million which was fixed by the previous Administration in 1963 is already fully subscribedand a sale of the BAC 1-1 Is could therefore only go through if thelimit were lifted to accommodate this particular transaction,4.      The Minister of Aviation, supported by the commonwealth secretary and by the Ministers of State, Department of economic affairs and Board of Trade, argued that the limit should be raised for the following reasons(a)    Even on the most pessimistic assumption about the prospects of repayment, the sale would not involve any direct cost toour balance of payments since the down payments would exceed the import content of the aircraft.    There would subsequently be sales of spares which would be paid forin cash.    The transaction would boost the prospects forthe sales of BAC 1-1 Is in other markets, with furtherbenefit to the balance of payments.    It cannot be assumed that, if the sale did not take place, the manufacturingresources would be used on exports elsewhere; and, inview of declining demand in the economy at the presenttime, the resources might well be left under-employed,-1-HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY lS GOVERNMENT)C(66) 165 COPY NO.     6712th November, 1966CABINET
(b) Aircraft are precisely the kind of technologically advancedexport for which we should be prepared to make creditavailable.    Even accepting that there might be some riskof having to re-finance repayments, we shall never succeed in building up our export potential if we are not preparedto take some risks..(c) The Indians, however, have always been punctilious in settling commercial debts, which this would be.    Thereis no reason to suppose that they will change their policyin this respect.    If they cannot buy aircraft from us, theywill certainly buy them from a competitor.    It is not clearthat purchase of the aircraft would affect the amount of anyre-financing of India fs inter-governmental debt, but evenif it did there is no reason why the British share of re-financing should be higher if the Indians bought aircraft from us rather than from a competitor,(d) If the Indians bought elsewhere, we should lose      million annually of exports for cash in the form of spares for theirexisting Viscount fleet and the cash earnings from spareswould go elsewhere.(e) To allow credit difficulties to stand in the way of the salewould be inconsistent with our commitment to maintain a viable aircraft industry,(f) Special assistance is not sought for the British aircraft corporation but only that they should be allowed to offer the same terms as their competitors.(g) The sale of British aircraft would help to improve ourrelations with India which have been under strain sincethe Indo-Pakistan war.5.     The Chief Secretary was unable to accept these arguments.His reasons may be summarised as follows:-(a) The Advisory Council of the Export Credits guarantee department has not been prepared to consider accepting this credit for insurance on normal commercial terms.Any decision to provide cover for it would therefore haveto be taken by the Government in the national interest.(b) The Indian economy is in an extremely grave condition.In the current year exports will finance less than halfof total imports (and there is a further deficit oninvisibles and capital account).    All this deficit isfinanced by aid.    Detailed forecasts for next yearsuggest that the position will be no better.    There is bound to be a huge gap between imports and the financeto pay for them for several years to come.-2-
(c) It is contrary to our policy to offer credit cover inmarkets where there is no reasonable chance of repay-ment.     In the case of India it is a question not of whether there is likely to be default on this particulardebt, but of her overall financial position; the Indianswill certainly have to ask for re-financing of inter -governmental debt; they may possibly ask at some futuretime for re-financing of commercial suppliers&apos; creditsas a number of other under-developed countries havedone; and even if they do not make a request in this form., they will need increased help directly or indirectly and will look to the creditor country concerned for that help.    A sale of BAC 1-1 Is would therefore be bound to lead to an increase in India&apos;s debts to the UnitedKingdom and we should seek instead to sell these aircraft in a more credit-worthy market,(d) The Plowden Committee did not recommend that theaircraft industry should be given any special assistance by way of credit cover.(e) It is accepted that if the Indians do not buy British aircraft,they will buy aircraft from one of our competitors.    but our competitors would treat credit cover for a ten-yearterm as part of their aid programme.   While we canmatch our competitors&apos; commercial credit terms, wecannot match their aid programmes.    To extend ten-yearcredit cover in the present case would only be acceptableif this were done as part of our aid programme;   but theMinister of Overseas Development is unable to accommodatethis v/ithin the present programme.conclusion.     I invite the Cabinet to decide whether the   20 million ceilingon officially insured business with India should be raised to accommodate the sale of BAC 1-11 aircraft to the Indian Airlines Corporation.D.
