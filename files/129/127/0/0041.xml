DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY !S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 182 COPY NO. fj g16th Decernber,   1966CABINETFAMILY ENDOWMENTNote by the Secretary of the Cabinet1I circulate for the information of the Cabinet the attached report by officials which is referred to in the memorandum (C(66) 181)by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister without Portfolio.(Signed)    BURKE TRENDhi IICabinet Office, S. W. 1.16th December, 1966\ i
SECRETFAMILY ENDOWMENTOn 17th November the Cabinet considered the problem of family-endowment against the background of (a) the findings of a recentministry of Social Security survey into family circumstances,  (b)a report  (S.3,(66)27) from the Social Services (Official) Committeeon possible schemes of family endowment and (c) a proposal toincrease charges for school meals and welfare milk.    As a result,of their discussion the Cabinet invited the Chancellor of theExchequer, in consultation with the Minister Without Portfolio, toarrange for urgent consideration to be given to an acceptable family endowment scheme (C.C. (66)58th Conclusions, Item 4(10)).    This reportby officials of the Treasury, the Cabinet Office, Inland revenue and the Ministry of Social Security analyses for them the mainpossibilities.Public Expenditure background,    The calculations by the Public Expenditure Committee on which ministers have been basing their decisions on public expenditure in1967-68 provided for a contingency allowance of  50m.   Expenditureon a new scheme of family endowment would be a charge against this allowance.    The Chancellor has indicated that, on the assumption thatany such scheme could not now be introduced until some way through1967-68, he would be prepared to contemplate a scheme costing about 10m. in that year.    No guidance has been given on the acceptablecost of a scheme which did not start until 1968/9.Possible Schemes3.    The objective at this stage is to improve the &quot;endowment&quot; of families with low incomes without necessarily improving the endowmentof families with higher incomes.    The problem is how to do this and where th draw the line. * 1^    In both the Social Services Committee and Cabinet, considerationof the schemes put forward in the report by the Social Services(Official) Committee tended to narrow down to support for one of twoAfferent approaches:    (a) an Increase in family allowances,associated with a reduction in income tax child allowances (hereafter/referred
oferred to as a &quot;give and take&quot; scheme), designed to restrict thejenefit of the increase to those paying less than the standard rate;f tax, and (b) an income-tested housing allowance scheme.    This3aper accordingly confines its analysis to schemes of these two types,j,     In considering these schemes it is important to hear in mind that the Ministry of Social Security&apos;s survey referred to in para.  1sbove showed that there are about 160,000 families, containing about;0O,OOO children, who are living below the current supplementary benefit level and unable to get their income up to that level because-fie father is either in full-time work or else on supplementary benefit but subject to the wage stop.   A significant measure of the effectiveness of any scheme is the extent to which it would reducethe number of these &quot;deficient&quot; families (including wage-stop cases).Both types of scheme under consideration would reduce but noteliminate wage-stop cases.    Complete elimination could only beachieved by straightforward supplementation of wages up to fullsupplementary benefit standards (including disregards) or by aprohibitively expensive increase of family allowances.Principles(j,    A &quot;give and take&quot; scheme has been advocated and resisted on grounds of principle.    These arguments cannot be reconciled:   they canonly be stated.7. On the one hand, it is argued that child tax relief and cashfamily allowances are both intended to give an advantage to people with children as against those without; that taken together they provide a flexible method for determining selectively how, and towhat extent, this advantage should be given; and that accordinglythey should be considered together in the light of their combined effect.8.    On the other hand, it is argued that there is an essential difference (accepted in the Beveridge Report and by the Royal Commissionmi Taxation reporting in 1954) between family allowances, which are a kind of State subsidy to families, and income tax child allowances,&quot;hich are part of the system of tax graduation, by which the tax/liability
ability is varied according to the taxpayer&apos;s family responsibilities;the fact that someone with a small income gets little or no benefitfom child allowances does not give him a tax grievance;    that the factiiat the value of the tax allowances rises with income simply reflects,8 progressive nature of the tax, which means that the higher is a5n&apos;s income, the higher is his marginal rate of tax;    and that a:3jor switch from, tax child allowances to family allowances would end to reduce taxable capacity and to introduce growing inflexibilitynto the system.There are also two fundamentally opposed attitudes to the ideafan income-tested scheme.    On the one hand, it is said that tonbark on an income-tested family endowment scheme would.representreversal of the philosophy of relying as little as possible oneans testing.    On the other hand, it is suggested that a more^elective approach than would be achieved by a &quot;give and take&quot;cherae is essential in order to relate the Government&apos; s social and[other policies to the necessarily limited resources available and tonsure that help is concentrated on those whose needs are greatest.Outline Schemes10.   Outlines of schemes of both types are given in the followingaragraphs.    The estimates of costs and effects are approximate (andin many cases based on small samples), and the figures should betreated with caution. ,rA&quot;give and take&quot; Scheme11.   A straightforward increase in family allowances of 10s. a week for each child at present qualifying would cost  180m. a year gross - 160m. after allowing for consequential savings on national insurance and Supplementary Benefits.    The Report of the social services (Official) Committee outlined a scheme for an increase ofthis amount matched by a reduction in the income tax child allowance^  45 a year for each family allowance child (i.e. each child afterthe first and hereafter referred to as a FAM child).    The effect ofthis arrangement would be to concentrate additional help on the lesssell-off families with inbuilt adjustment for   those with higher/income
income through the normal tax machinery.     The effect on somespecimen families is shown in Annex k.     Families paying income taxat less than the standard rate, or not paying tax at all, would gain;those paying tax at the standard rate on earned income up to about 4,000 a year would lose under this particular scheme kd. a weekper PAM child;    above this point the loss would be greater thehigher the income.12.   The net cost of the scheme would be  33m. in a full year (onthe basis of the Revenue&apos;s latest income statistics) but  k9m. inthe first year (since not all of the year&apos;s tax reaches theExchequer in the financial year).13.   The main effects may be summarised as follows (some further details are shown in the annexed Tables):-(a) About 57% of the deficient families, containing about 65%of children in such families, would be brought up to or above the supplementary benefit level and most of theremaining deficient families would &quot;be substantially helped.(b) In all about 2m. families would benefit, 1^m. of them by/6d. a week or more per PAM child.(c) About 2m. families (those paying tax at the standard rateor above) would lose;    in most cases the loss would be kd.a week per PAM child;   the total loss would thus increase with the size of the family.(d) The number of current wage-stop cases would (on a crudeestimate) be reduced from about 27,000 to about 18,000.Ik.   If it were possible to introduce this scheme in 1967/8 (see para. 35) it would cost substantially more than the  10m. in 1967/68mentioned by the Chancellor (see para. 2 above).     No worthwhile&quot;give and take&quot; scheme could cost as little as  10m. in 1967/68 butit would be possible to have a &quot;give and take&quot; scheme within  20m.in subsequent years.     An increase of 7s. in family allowances (theminimum necessary to restore the 10s., though not the 8s. allowance to the original relationship with average earnings which family allowances had when introduced in &quot;191$) coupled with a reduction of 35 in tax child allowances for each PAM child would cost  20m. in a full/ye ar
year but .C33m. in the first year.    It would leave the standard ratetaxpayer worse off normally by 9d. a week per FAivi child.15.    The main effects of this 7s. scheme are:-(a) About kk&apos;-fo of deficient families containing        of thechildren would be brought up to or above supplementary benefit level.(b) In all about 1fm. families would benefit, of them frn. by/bd. a week or more per FAM child.(c) About 2^m. families would lose, normally by 9d. a week perFAM child.(d) The number of current wage-stop cases would (on a crudeestimate) be reduced from about 27,000 to about 22,000.It will be seen that this scheme is markedly less effective in helping those whose needs are greatest and in preserving the positionof standard rate taxpayers.16. Apart from the specific points related to the two schemesconsidered above, there are certain general features common tovirtually any such &quot;give and take&quot; scheme.(a) This approach affords a means of concentrating additionalbenefit on the lower income groups at moderate cost, andwithout the disadvantage of a new and overt income test.(b) Part of the benefit would go to a considerable number of families in the area immediately above the supplementary benefit level.    This is arguably very desirable if they areto be adversely affected by increased charges for school meals (see para. 27 below).(c) It would not help deficient families with one child(estimated at about 20,000), nor would it (marginal casesapart] help the families currently receiving supplementary benefits or National Insurance Benefits, whose increase in family allowances would be taken fully into account, leavingthem no better off.(d) It would increase the payment received by the mother and reduce the take-home pay of the father, in some cases quite/substantially
substantially.    (For example, under the first schemedealt with above, a married man with three children belowthe age of 11 earning  20 a week would have his take-homepay cut by 15s. a week, which would more than double his present tax deductions, while his wife would get an extra 1 family allowances).(e) As a result, it would involve a major reframing of thefinancial circumstances of 4m. families which would benefita much smeller number (about half in either of the two schemes quoted).(f) The effect would be that parents with 2 or more children would begin to -pay tax on earnings, or to pay tax at thestandard rate, sooner than at present.   E.g. under thefirst scheme outlined, a married man with four children,two under 11 and two between 11 and 16, would start to paytax on earnings at less than  15a week instead of nearly 20 a week, as at present.17.   Although both schemes considered above would leave theordinary standard rate taxpayer slightly worse off, it would bepossible to adjust either scheme to prevent this;   the cost ofeliminating the 4d. loss a week per FAM child under the more expensive scheme would be of the order of  6m. a year.B.   Housing Allowance Scheme18.    The purpose of a housing allowance scheme is to give low-incomefamilies a benefit to help to meet their housing costs.    Thosefamilies with one child or more below the age limits used for family allowances, and whose incomes were at or below the qualifying incomelevel, would obtain benefit equal to the actual &quot;rent&quot; (i,e. rent and rates - or, in the case of the owner-occupier, equivalentoutgoings - if this were reasonable) or 30s. a week whichever wasthe higher.   If income exceeded the qualifying level, the amount paid would he reduced on a tapering basis.19.   Annex 1 describes one such scheme in some detail.it   main   features are qualifying   income   levels of  8 10s, aweek (net of   national insurance   contribution)   for a   married/couple
couple ( 6 10s. for a single person, e.g. a separated wife) with an addition of 17s. for each child after the first.     All income exceptfamily allowances would he taken into account in full.20.   Benefit would be assessed every six months by reference to size of family, rent, &quot;normal&quot; earnings (using past and present earningsas a guide) and other income.   The use of &quot;normal earnings&quot; would help to avoid the need for adjustment on account of fluctuatingearnings except where there was an abnormal fluctuation.      Theascertainment and checking of &quot;normal earningsW would present difficulties in some cases;   but the concept is not entirely new(it is already used for instance in wage-stop cases and legal aiddeterminations), and the experience of local offices in theadministration of supplementary benefits, especially in relation tothe temporarily unemployed, would be of value.    There would also bea need for working arrangements between the Ministry of social security and local authorities to ensure that there was no overlappingbetween this scheme and their rebates of rents and rates.    (such arrangements already exist in relation to supplementary benefits).21.   The annual cost of this scheme at present rent and earningslevels is estimated at about  20m.   Details of its effects aregiven in the annexed Tables,   The main features are:-(a) About 83$ of the deficient families, containing aboutllfo of the children, would br brought up to or above the supplementary benefit level, and most of the remainingdeficient families would&apos; be substantially helped.(b) In all about 306,000 families, containing nearly 1m,children, would benefit, 266,000 of them by 2s.6d. a week or more per child, including the first.   1(c) A few, possibly 1,000-2,000 deficient families, would notiibenefit at all.(d) The number of current wage-stop cases would (on a crudeestimate) be reduced from about 27,000 to about 12,000.22.   The above scheme is a variant of the housing allowance schemedescribed in the report of the Social Services (Official) Committee./The
latter had a qualifying income level of  8 a week net for a married couple with an addition of 15s. for each child after the first;   theamount payable was &quot;based on actual rent or  1 a week, whicheverwas higher.     The current cost was put at about  17m. a year.     that scheme would bring 69% of deficient families up to or abovesupplementary benefit level, and would benefit about 235,000 families(800,000   children).23.   The essential features of any housing allowance scheme alongthese lines are:-(a) It would take account of individual variations in income and rent, and for families above but not those below the qualifying income level it would also take some accountof size of family.(b) It would not be ordinary supplementation of wages but would&quot;be directly related to a necessary item of expenditure(failure to meet which may often be a major cause of family distress);    and the benefit payable would automatically change if rent changed, for instance as aresult of a move.(c) The cost of this scheme would rise with a general rise inrent levels and fall with a general rise in low earningslevels (until the qualifying income levels were raised).(d) It would involve an extension of income-testing, which public opinion might or might not find undesirable.(e) For those affected by the taper arrangements there wouldhe a reduced financial incentive to increase or maintain their earnings;   there would also be a disincentive toaccept short periods of higher paid employment for fearof increasing the assessment of &quot;normal&quot; earnings.(f) Even with maximum publicity a proportion of familiesqualified to receive the allowance would fail   to claim it through unwillingness or ignorance.(g) Private landlords might put up rents in the knowledge thatthey would be paid in full, and that there would thereforebe no incentive for the tenant to appeal although of coursesuch increases would not necessarily be provided for underthe scheme; the Rent Act is however available to prevent abuse.
Staffing2h.    Both the &quot;give and take&quot; scheme and the housing allowance scheme would require a permanent increase in staff as well asextra staff-hours initially, from overtime or extra temporary staff, in order to get them properly launched.     Approximateestimates of additional initial staff-hours to launch the schemes are: -&quot;Give and take&quot;.     Inland Revenue 900,000*Ministry of Social Security 5 00,0001,UOO,000Housing allowance.   Ministry of Social Security        600,000Estimates of permanent extra staff are:-&quot;Give and take&quot;:     Inland Revenue 600oMinistry of Social Security 30630Housing allowance: Ministry of Social Security 500^*Twice this number if scheme launched part way through a financial year.0Because of extra complications and the many families brought within the tax range.$This assumes a case load of about 270,000, i.e.  about 90% uptake.These figures show that on staffing grounds there is not much to choose &quot;between the two schemes,, after the initial launching period.Future adjustments25.   The effectiveness of the two s chemes in bringing &quot;deficient&quot;families up to the minimum standard has been measured hy referenceto the current supplementary benefit rates.     The effect of the two schemes in relation to supplementary benefit standards would however he different at any future date.     In the first place, the supplementary benefit rates will probably go up at the end ofOctober 1967, and this factor, hy itself, would diminish the
effectiveness of either scheme measured by this yardstick.Increases in rents would not reduce the effectiveness of a housing allowance scheme, because the allowance goes up as rent increases, but they would increase the cost of the scheme;   rent increases would mean that without further adjustment, which wouldsimilarly increase the cost, a give and take scheme would be less effective, because rent is added to the supplementary benefitscale to determine the &quot;guaranteed&quot; minimum income for supplementary benefit purposes (see Annex 7 for examples).     Inthe opposite direction, increases in the earnings of the familiesconcerned would by themselves reduce the deficiencies of familiesby supplementary benefit standards and would thus make both schemesmore effective;   they would reduce the cost of a housing allowance scheme and also of a give and take scheme because the tax yieldwould be greater.26.   The longer the interval between the working out of a scheme andits introduction, the more speculative are the estimates of itscost and effectiveness because of the effects of movements in rent and earnings.     If a housing allowance scheme were introduced in summer 1967 (see following section) decisions would have to be basedon present estimates;    if a give and take scheme were to beintroduced in April 1968, a public announcement of the details wouldhave to be made not later than next Autumn; in either case not less than6 months could elapse between the decision on and implementation ofa scheme.School Meals and Welfare Milk27.   In summing up the Cabinet discussion on 17th November, thePrime Minister said that the Cabinet would be prepared to agree thatthe charge for school meals and the price of welfare milk should beincreased in the Autumn of 1967, conditionally on the working out
of an acceptable family endowment scheme which would, amongst other things, help to reduce the impact of these increases on familiesless well able to afford them.28.    Under existing arrangements all families with incomes at orbelow supplementary benefit levels (i.e. whether or not actuallyreceiving supplementary benefits) can get school meals free on application subject to the necessary income test.     The questionis therefore whether and if so to what extent those with incomesabove these levels who at present pay the charge for school mealsin full should get relief if charges are raised.     (Annex 5illustrates supplementary benefit levels of income.)29.   There are two possible approaches to this.     First it couldbe left that such relief should be regarded as covered fully by whatever net benefit a &quot;give and take&quot; scheme or a housing allowance scheme provided for those with incomes above supplementary benefitlevels.     Secondly relief could be given by building more generousrelief into the school meals scheme.30.   On the first approach it is not easy to quantify the respectivenet benefits under each type of scheme.     There is no doubt thatthe give and take type would benefit more people with higherincomes - some net benefit would go to all families with two ormore children with earnings of up to  20 per week - but the  33m.net cost scheme would also mean a loss of normally hd. per weekper FAM child for all standard rate taxpayers, and the  20m. net costscheme a loss for them of normally 9d. a week per FAM child. A housing allowance scheme would be more concentrated on &quot;deficient&quot;families though even so the  20m. scheme outlined above would benefitnearly as many &quot;non-deficient&quot; families (i.e. those above the supplementary benefit level) as deficient ones. The effect ofthe taper would be to give some benefit to those earning up to  h
or more above the qualifying limit for full benefit.      (this cannot he expressed in terms of gross income &quot;because the qualifying levels are net of national insurance contributions,fares, etc., and also of rent itself.)31.   On the second approach there seems no technical reason whythe school meals scheme of relief should not he improved in whatever way seemed called for in the light of decisions taken ona give and take or housing allowance scheme.     A longer taperwould increase the number of families eligible for remissionsubject to means testing by the local authority;   it is possible,that better off families would be less unwilling to apply for income tested remission of charges than those at present eligible.32.   The situation is therefore that if no arrangements were madeto taper relief for the cost of school meals for those abovesupplementary benefit levels, the &quot;give and take&quot; scheme by itself would be likely in general to place those with incomes abovesupplementary benefit levels and paying less than the standard ratesof tax in a better position than would a housing allowance schemehut would place those paying standard rates of tax in a worse position.Incomes Policy\v33.   The White Paper on Prices and Incomes Standstill:   Period of income Restraint (Cmnd.3150) stated that &quot;improvement of thestandard of living of the worst-off members of the community is a primary social objective&quot;.     Either a &quot;give and take&quot; or a housing allowance scheme would achieve this effect and both would thereforehe broadly consistent with the objective.     It has been argued thata &quot;give and take&quot; scheme would be more acceptable to the TradeUnions than an income-tested scheme, and more helpful in dealingwith pressure for wage improvements based on the difficulties of low paid workers with families:    such a scheme would thus be of
assistance to the incomes policy.     But, as has been shown earlier,the benefits of a &quot;give and take&quot; scheme would be spread more widely than those of an income-tested scheme and would help more people with incomes above supplementary benefit levels.     It can be argued, therefore, that a means-tested scheme, by concentratinghelp only on low income families, would be more consistent withthe policy of incomes restraint than a &quot;give and take&quot; scheme.Timing34.   Problems of timing arise both on a &quot;give and take&quot; and on a housing allowance scheme.35.   A &quot;give and take&quot; scheme should be introduced at the beginningof a tax year with PAYE recodings prepared in the preceding monthson the basis of the new allowances.      It is not now practicable to do this with effect from April 1967.     It is assumed that Ministersaccept that it would not be practicable either to introduce a &quot;giveand take&quot; scheme part way through 1967-68, because of administrativecomplexities and the burden on the I.R. and on employers and of theeffects on individual taxpayers.     If a &quot;give and take&quot; scheme were introduced in April 1968, firm details would have to be announced by early Autumn (i.e. in time for the annual recoding operation), tobe followed by legislation with Royal Assent preferably by the endof the year.36.   In the case of a housing allowance scheme the view of theMinistry of Social Security is that:-(1)   A launching period of about 13 weeks would need to beallowed (as in the case of the new supplementary benefitsscheme) for claims to be made and dealt with - something like k00,000 could be expected - before the operative date for payment of benefit.(2)   The launching of the scheme would require an estimated600,000 extra man hours of work in the Ministry of social security&apos;8 local offices over a 13-week period mainlybefore but partly after the operative date.(3)   Because of (2), the launching period must be timed so thatthe new scheme involved no risk of disturbance of thethree months or so of preparatory work required in the
local offices for the general uprating of benefits planned for the end of October, 1967.(h)   Also because of (2), the launching period must not occur inthe winter months, when the strain on the Ministry&apos;s local offices is heaviest and over-burdening could readily leadto breakdown.I These considerations, together with the need to prepare and carry1 through the necessary legislation and make administrative1 preparations (including the recruitment and training of extra staffI for the local offices) before claims could be invited, lead to theI conclusion that the only time at which such a scheme could possibly be introduced in the 1967/68 financial year would be July or August1967, provided this could be done without imperilling the generaluprating due to follow shortly afterwards (the date of which oncefixed could not be postponed if the initial Housing Allowance workproved unexpectedly heavy or protracted).   At this stage the Ministryof Soeial Security consider that while a risk to the uprating-arrangements would be unavoidable, it might be reduced to an acceptable level if - but only if - either the operative date forthe Housing Allowance could be made no later than the end of July, or,if it had to be later, the general uprating of benefits could be correspondingly deferred into November.    In either case this wouldrequire: -(a) a decision by Ministers before Christmas to go ahead with a.Housing Allowance Scheme; and(b) the necessary legislation to be at least through the,Commons by Easter - and Royal Assent by Easter if thegeneral uprating were not to be postponed.Furthermore, the practicability of the operation in 1967 is dependenton no further substantial load of extra work being imposed on theMinistry&apos;s local offices during 1967.   If the above conditions couldnot be satisfied, the Ministry consider that a Housing Allowance scheme could not be introduced before May 1968, as an operative date.
37.    In summary, subject to the necessary speed on legislation,there may just be a possibility of a Housing Allowance Scheme with effect from July/August 1967.   Otherwise, neither type of scheme could he introduced before April/May 1968.The Longer Term38.   The question arises whether as a matter of practical politicsand as a matter of technique the introduction of a &quot;give and take&quot;scheme or a housing allowance scheme would necessarily limit theGovernments freedom of manoeuvre thereafter.39.   As a matter of technique there is no reason why a &quot;give and take&quot;scheme which is a device for securing a particular relationship between family allowances and child tax allowances at a givenmomentof time, either must be repeated or must preclude an income testedscheme as well or could not be superseded by some other type of scheme.   The same is true mutatis mutandis of a housing allowance scheme.kO.   As a practical matter, the Government1 s freedom of action afterintroducing either type of scheme would depend a good deal on thenature of the decision taken and on how it was publicly presented.If the Government decided that one or other course was right inprinciple and said so, this could well determine the general line ofpolicy at least for some years ahead.    If however a scheme was introduced and explained on the basis that it was intended simplyand solely to deal with the immediate problem and must not be taken as implying anything about the way in which further problems in this field would be tackled, then future freedom of action would be less likely to be affected.^Further analysis of the longer term consequences of introducingeither type of scheme is needed and a further report will be made within a few days^/
ANNEX 1A Housing Allowance scheme.     A possible approach to the problem of low wage earners withfamilies would be to introduce a housing allowance scheme underwhich families with one or more children whose incomes are at or&quot;below a qualifying income level would obtain benefit equal to theirrent^.The income test2.     The housing allowance scheme illustrated in the Social ServicesOfficial Committee&apos;s Report (SS(66)27) had qualifying income limits of  8 (net of national insurance contribution) for a married couple( 6 per week for a single person, e.g. a separated wife) with an addition of 15s. for each child after the first^.     All income(except family allowances) over the qualifying limits was taken intoaccount at the rate of 6d. per 1s. for the first  2, 9d. per 1s.for the second  2 and 1s. per 1s. thereafter, so as to give someincentive to earn more where earnings were up to  h above.     Whereincome was below the qualifying level, full benefit would be paidequal to the family&apos;s rent, providing this was reasonable, or  1a week, if this was higher.3.     A wider coverage than given by the illustrative scheme could beachieved by raising the qualifying income limits or by making thetaper less steep.     The former would be more attractive because morefamilies would qualify for a full housing allowance;    extending thetaper would mean that more families would qualify for a reducedhousing allowance.k.     The improved qualifying limits suggested are  8 10s. net for a married couple ( 6 10s. single) with an, addition of 17s. for each child after the first.     The rates at which income over the qualifying limits is taken into account would remain unchanged, butthe minimum rent level would be  1 10s. a week.1^&quot;Rent&quot; means rent and rates or, in the case of the owner-occupier,equivalent outgoings.&quot;Child&quot; means a child under 16 or continuing his full-time secondary education up to age 19.
5,     &quot;Disregards&quot;   There would be no other &quot;disregards&quot;, as thereare in supplementary benefits, for certain kinds of income.    Toallow them would enlarge the field of beneficiaries and so add to cost - and the extra coat would not necessarily benefit the poorestfamilies.    Two kinds of income in particular - war pensions and afiife&apos;3 part-time earnings - should be especially mentioned in this context, however, because each is disregarded up to  2 per week for supplementary benefit purposes and it could be expected to promptcriticism of the housing allowance if different treatment wereafforded.    A war pension disregard of  2 per week might be concededas defensible on the general principle of preference for the wardisabled, as being different in kind from all other income, andinexpensive in its effects since few cases are concerned;    but oneconcession might encourage pressure &amp;r others.   The wife&apos;s earnings are in a different category - a large number of families would bemade eligible by a  2 disregard here (some 60,000 more families,over and above the 160,000 deficient families, would have beendeficient but for the wife&apos;s earnings), so a concession would be expensive.   On the point of principle, moreover, it can be shownthat the effect of the tapering provision in paragraph 2 is to givea disregard of up to 30s. a week on earnings just above the qualifyinglimit, whether of husband or wife, so that the departure fromsupplementary benefit practice would be defensible.Operation of the income-test-o.     Assessment of benefit would be based on half-yearly   statements by the husband (or single parent) as. to size of family, rent andnormal earnings.    Since earnings fluctuate they would be taken intoaccount (as under current supplementary benefits practice wherepart-time earnings are being supplemented) on the basis of &quot;normal&quot;earnings, using past and present earnings as a guide;   benefit would therefore need to be adjusted on account of fluctuating earnings
only where there was an abnormal fluctuation.    Appropriateverification would be required, e.g. by reference to the familyI allowance book, rent-book and statements of earnings, either at thelocal office of the Ministry of Social Security, by a visit to thehome or (in the case of earnings) by confirmation from the employer.7.     Rent and rates rebates   The assessment of benefit would need to be adjusted in respect of rebates of rents and rates payable bythe local Authority.    This could be done:-either (1)   by providing that the unrehated rent and rates are tobe met by way of housing allowance, and that inconsequence no rebate would be payable by the LocalAuthority (this follows the legislative provisionof the Ministry of Social Security Act in respect ofsupplementary benefits and rate rebates and what hasevolved in common practice as regards supplementary benefits and rent rebates)?or        (2)   by providing that housing allowance is to meet the rentafter rebates of rent and rates have been afforded andtherefore, to be ignored by Local Authority in affordingrent and rate rebates.Either course would require working arrangements between the ministry and Local Authorities similar to those now in operation in respectof rent or rates rebates and supplementary benefits.8.    Payment   Payment of benefit would probably he by order-bookof six months&apos; duration, for weekly encashment at the Post Office.9.     Reviews   Renewal of the benefit would normally take place aftersix months on a further statement by the claimant (with appropriateverification), with any necessary adjustment e.g. to take account ofa rent increase.    The benefit would be reviewed in the interim onlyto take account of significant changes, e.g. removal or a change ofjob leading to a substantial change of earnings.   Periods of temporarysickness or unemployment would not affect title to (or the amount of)
housing allowance, since the benefit would be calculated on &quot;normalearnings&quot;, i.e. ignoring sickness or unemployment.Effect of the scheme10.   The following table compares the effect of the improved scheme(with qualifying income limits as in paragraph 4) with that&apos; of theearlier scheme (income limits as in paragraph 2):-ImprovedSchemeSumber of deficient families whobenefitlumber of families with incomes abovecurrent supplementary benefitstandards who also benefitTotal families who benefitlumber of children in families whobenefitProportion of deficient familiesuhose deficiency is met -(a) in full(b) in full or within10s. a week158,000148,000306,0001,000,00083*88$original scheme&quot;150,00085,000235,000800,00069/*82$111.

The redistributive effect of the improved scheme is illustrated the following table which shows how much families benefit perchild under the housing allowance scheme;    it also indicates, withina wider margin of error, the number of children involved:

The cost of the improved scheme assuming a 90$ uptake would beof the order of  2If million in a full year, made up as followss- for 160,000 &quot;deficient&quot; families(2,000 of whom do not benefit) 17.0For 148,000 &quot;surplus&quot; families 6.9Total cost 23.990$ uptake 21.4For comparison, the cost of the original scheme was estimated at about  17 million in a full year.14.   On the basis of carrying out the necessary interviews mainlyat local offices, and verification either at the office or by postand with little home visiting, the cost would be 160 units per100,000 cases, i.e. on a case-load of 306,000 (see paragraph 10)the manpower cost would be of the order of 500 staff units.15.   The figure of  21-1 million in paragraph 13 above makes no allowance for (a) any savings to the Exchequer on the rate and rent rebate schemes;    (b) savings from not meeting rents in full becausethey are unreasonable;    (c) the likely overestimate of the cost of helping one-child families whose income deficiencies have been assumed to be the average of all families;    (d) savings from
sub-tenancies and boarders and possible savings from rentcontributed from earning non-dependent members of the family;(e) understatement of income in the family circumstances survey.Nor, on the other hand, does it allow for the extra cost of NorthernIreland, which may be about  f million, or for administrative costssince these depend on decisions on the precise operation of theincome-test.   For practical purposes, therefore, the effective costmight be taken as about  20 millions   in so far as earnings rosefaster than rents, the cost of the scheme would tend to be less(and contrariwise).Future adjustments16.   Tne qualifying income levels could be raised    hereafter as the supplementary benefit rates were adjusted as they will be inOctober 1967.   Thus, in so far as the low-income families11 earningsmight not in the event be improved under the incomes policysufficiently to lift them above supplementary benefit standards, thehousing allowance would continue to meet the deficiency in the great bulk of cases at correspondingly increased cost.     Rent increases would, of course, be taken into account automatically atcorrespondingly increased cost.

ANNEX 6Financial effect on specimen families of the give and take schemeNote to TablesThe tables compare the family allowance at present received and the tax at present paid per week, with what would be received and paid if the family allowance were increased by 10/- per weekand the child allowance cut by  h5 per annum for all second and subsequent children.It is assumed that the husband&apos;s earnings are the only source of income for the family.    The occasional small difference   in theincrease in tax paid per week, in cases where the increase would beexpected to be the same, is due to rounding of the earned incomerelief and to the fact that the tax figures have all been roundedto the nearest 1d. per week.Symbols used:M   indicates that the taxpayer is a married man with x childrenall under eleven (and hence with x child allowances of  115).^^25 and ^x+50 indicate that one and two child supplements of 25 are given (e.g. ^2+25 mean a *nere are two children, one over andone under eleven, and so there are child allowances of  1hO for thefirst child and  115 for the second).
