IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYlS GOVERNMENT)C(66) 184 COPY NO.19th December, 1966CABINET6SERVICE DOCTORS AND DENTISTS: AMOUNT of pay INCREASE&quot;Note by the First Secretary of State and Secretary ofState for Economic AffairsThe Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes havebeen unable to reach an agreed conclusion 011 the amount of pay increase for service doctors and dentists.2.      The pay of service doctors and dentists has normally been reviewed at the same time as that of other serving officers.    In theWhite Paper on Service Pay and Pensions at the beginning of thisyear (Cmnd 2903), which announced general increases in service pay to take effect from 1st April, 1966, there were no proposals for increases in the pay of service doctors and dentists, but theGovernment undertook to take account of increases awarded to civilian doctors and dentists engaged in the National Health service in reaching decisions about the pay of service doctors and dentists.3,     The background to the problem, and the range of possibleoffers considered by the Ministerial Committee on Prices and incomes, are set out in the attached note by officials which was before the Ministerial Committee at a meeting to-day.4.      The majority of the Committee inclined to the view that an offer of 18 or 20 per cent would be impossible to justify in terms ofprices and incomes policy, particularly for people at this sort of salary level.    Most Ministers present shared the view of theChancellor of the Exchequer that service doctors and dentists shouldbe offered an increase of 10 per cent in basic pay (7^ per cent in totalemoluments); they agreed that an increase of 10 per cent need not bepaid in instalments, but could be paid in full from 1st July, 1967 with effect from 1st October, I966.5.     The following were the main additional points made in thediscussion -(a)    The Minister of Health doubted whether the British medical association (BMA) would in practice carry out their threat of blacklisting service medical appointments, even for an offer as low as 10 per cent.    The Secretary of State for defence pointed out, however, that, even if there were no formal blacklisting, an offer which was regarded asmanifestly inequitable could have a serious effect on the staffing of medical appointments in the armed services.-1-
M. S.Department of Economic Affairs, S. W. 1.19th December, 1966-2-(b)    The BMA have accepted an increase of 10 per cent in the pay of university clinical teachers, who represent amore delicate problem.     (On the other hand, this is notconclusive evidence that they would accept 10 per cent for service doctors, because the university clinicalteachers&apos; traditional analogue is the senior hospitaldoctor whose increase in the last Xindersley review wasonly 10 per cent. )6.      The Secretary of State for Defence would be prepared tosettle for an increase of 18 per cent and to justify it to the BMAon the grounds   suggested in paragraphs 9 to 12 of   the note by officials.    He was not, however, able to accept the view of othermembers of the Committee that the increase should be limited to10 per cent.7.     As Chairman of the Ministerial Committee on Prices and incomes, I am therefore putting this matter to the Cabinet for adecision.
SERVICE DOCTORS AMD DENTISTSAMOUMTtOF PAY INCREASENote by OfficialsWhen the Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes discussed Servicedoctors&apos; and dentists pay on 12th December (Pl(66) 15th Meeting, Minute 1),Ministers decided to defer a decision until there had been further study and discussion of the possible bases of compromise.       Officials of theTreasury, the Department of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Defencehave accordingly met for a further examination of the problem.     It hasnot been possible to reach agreement on a definite recommendation to ministers;    officials have, however, agreed upon this note as a statement ofthe possible bases of offers to the British Medical Association ( MA), andthe arguments for and against each.background.     In considering possible offers the following points have to be borne in mind:(a) Ministers are committed by the White Paper on Service Pay and pensions (Cmnd. 2903) to take account of increases awarded to civilian doctors and dentists engaged in the National health service (NHS) in reaching decisions about the pay of Servicedoctors and dentists.(b) In 1962 the pay of Service doctors and dentists was specificallyestablished in terms of a 16 per cent lead over the average net career income of the NHS general medical practitioner.The same pattern was followed in 19&amp;4.The analogy that holds the field is thus that of the NHS general practitioner;. . if that is to be abandoned, the Government should be in a position to justifyany offer by reference to an analogy with remuneration of other NHS doctors -which means in practice hospital doctors.3.     It is also relevant that in April as the result of a report by theNational Board for Prices and Incomes, other Service officers receivedincreases, mainly over 18 per cent in basic pay (l3i per cent in emoluments).
4.     Since the pay of Service-doctors and dentists was last reviewed in1964., NHS general practitioners have received the following increases:(i)   about 9 per cent on 1st April 1965, primarily on accountof increased workload and loss of doctors;(ii)   increases amounting to about 32 per cent on total net incomepayments, again with the object of rewarding increasingworkload, improving the attractiveness of general practice and stemming the loss of doctors, in a new system of remunerationwhich abandoned the concept of average net income and includednew forms of special payments which remunerate features of civilian practice which have no oounterpart or are otherwiserewarded in Service life (e.g. seniority and merit payments,allowances for group practice and practice in designated areas,f\nd sickness payments).   These increases were phased, the first half being paid with effect from 1st April 1966 (subsequentlydeferred to 1st October 1966) and the second half from 1st April 1967.5.     Strict adherence to the general practitioner analogy would point to anincrease of 44 per cent for Service doctors and dentists.     That is not, inquestion;    indeed, given the reasons for the large increase for general practitioners, it would be indefensible.       But it has to be recognised thatno offer in the range between 10 and 20 per cent (the extreme positionsconsidered at the meeting of the Ministerial Committee) Could be justified on the basis of the policy, accepted since 1962, of settling the pay ofService doctors by reference to the maintenance of a 16 per cent, lead overthe career earnings of the NHS general medical practitioner.    Even anincrease of 20 per cent would wipe out this lead, and would be accepted bythe BMA only as a pragmatic settlement in the light of the needs of incomesi ipolicy,6.     The figures considered at the last meeting of the Ministerial Committeewere 20 per cent, 18 per cent, 13^ per cent and 10 per cent.     Thefollowing are the arguments for and against each figure.20 per cent on basic pay (15 per cent on emoluments)7.     While this cannot be precisely justified in relation to the increase forgeneral practitioners, it has the practical advantage that the BMA would accept an offer of 20 per cent, though they have hitherto said that acceptancewould be conditional upon a further increase later on corresponding to thesecond instalment of the general practitioners&apos; increases.     If ministers decided to offer 20 per cent, it would have to be on the accepted condition that it was a final offer and that there would be no question of a secondinstalment.     If the BMA accepted that, then the offer would secure their continued co-operation in recruiting doctors to the Services.     In the viewof the Ministry of Defence this would maintain a reasonable relationahipbetween the pay of Service doctors and that of other officers.
8.     The main objection   to an offer of 20 per cent is its size.   It would hedifficult to justify in terms of prices and incomes policy, and would tendto revive former suspicions that incomes policy was in practice being appliedless rigorously to the higher paid than to the lower paid.   It is larger than could be justified by reference to the increases recommended earlierthis year for NHS general medical practitioners, after excluding from the reckoning additional payments which remunerate features of general practice which have no counterpart- or are otherwise rewarded in Service life(cf. paragraph 9). Finally, the increases for general practitioners were intended to stem the loss of doctors from general practice by improvingits attractiveness; their efficaoy for this purpose will be diminished ifincreases for other groups of doctors are too great.9.     This figure can be derived from the increases for NHS general practitioners by excluding from the reckoning additional payments under thepractice that have no counterpart or are otherwise rewarded in Service life(see annex for detailed calculation).     It could therefore be defended asmaintaining the analogy with general practitioners, mutatis mutandis;and, as it relates to the total effect of the recent increases for general practitioners (i.e. the whole of the Kindersley recommendations), it wouldprovide geod ground for refusing to contemplate a second instalment.10.   18 per cent is about the same figure as other Service officers receivedlast April,     For ithis reason it would be unacceptable to the BMA, who setgreat store by the analogy with other doctors.   They have stated that theycould not accept a figure which would treat the Service doctor exactly thesame as his fellow officers.   We do not know whether the BMA would carry this attitude to the point of refusing an offer of 18 per cent (supposing that ministers were prepared to go to this figure), if it were clear that there wasno prospect of a higher offer.   The Ministry of Defence believe, however, thatno lower figure would have any chance of securing acceptance,11,     From the point of view of prices and incomes policy 18 per cent is not much of an improvement on 20 per cent:    the objections to 20 per cent (paragraph above) apply with little less force to 18 per.cent.   Moreover in negotiation with the BMA it would be difficult to argue that the differencebetween 18 and 20 per cent was of such critical significance that an offer of20 per cent was out of the question.new system of remuneration that relate to features of civilian general-3-
12.     It can also &quot;be argued that, even when payments for features peculiar to civilian practice have &quot;been excluded, the 18 per cent derived from theKmdersley increases for general practitioners still reflects factors suchas increased workload and loss of doctors to a greater extent than is appropriate for Service doctors;   &quot;but there is no basis for saving what further deduction should &quot;be made to take account of these differences,except by reference to a different analogue:   the increases for hospital doctors.13^ per cent on &quot;basic pay (10 per pent On emoluments)13.   13i per cent is the amount of the increase in the salary &quot;bill for allNHS hospital doctors, following the Kindersley recommendations.   The case for adopting this figure (or 10 per cent) is that the changes in the systemof remuneration for general practitioners are so fundamental that that analogycannot be used at all as the basis for settling Service doctors&apos; pay on this occasion, and that the best way of deciding what the Kindersley Review Bodythought appropriate for medical remuneration in the absence of the specialconsiderations applying to general practitioners is to look at the average increase for hospital doctors.   It could be argued that, while the Servicedoctor&apos;s work approximates more closely to that of the general practitionerthan to the hospital doctor, his conditions more closely resemble those ofa hospital doctor in that the State pays him a salary and itself provides(rather than reimburses him for) premises and equipment.- ii -14.    To turn to the analogy of the hospital doctor presents its own risks.The hospital doctors (particularly in the middle and upper grades) aredissatisfied with their recent increases, by comparison with those for general practitioners, and will be presenting a case for substantial increasesthemselves in 1968 (if not before).    The Review Body may not accept the case;but, if the Government argue for the analogy of the hospital doctor on this occasion, they may find themselves hoist with their own petard if it is inthe BMA&apos;s interest at the next review of Service doctors&apos; pay to base their case on an analogy with the hospital doctor.15.   Moreover it is difficult to argue that the features of general practice which led the Review Body to recommend large increases for general practitioners are totally irrelevant to Service doctors.   Thus a proposal to turn to the analogy of the hospital doctor would not be easy to justify, except on the negative ground that the general practitioner analogy was on this occasion completely unusable because of the changes in the system of remuneration.
16.     It is certain that the BMA would accept neither the analogy of thehospital doctor nor the resulting figure;     and it would, be bitterly resentedby Service doctors.   If no offer which they can countenance is made, the BMAwill probably feel bound to withdraw their co-operation in recruitment andto blacklist advertisements for Service medical appointments.   This, and theloss of manpower from the armed forces medical services to which an offerregarded as inadequate could give rise, could lead very quickly to a mostserious and probably unmanageable shortage of doctors in the Services, whichcould be very expensive to remedy, whatever changes of organisation of medical care could be contrived.10 per cent on basic pay (7,? per cent on emoluments)17.   10 per cent is the approximate increase for consultants and seniorhospital medical officers following the Kindersley recommendations.   As abasis for settling Service doctors&apos; pay this would have the advantage of excluding the large increases for junior hospital doctors which are includedin the average increase of lJS^r per oent for all hospital doctors;    it couldbe argued that 10 per cent represents the amount by which the KindersleyReview Body thought medical remuneration should be increased where no specialfactors applied.18,     This figure would clearly be the easiest of the four to defend in termsof prices and incomes policy.   But it can be argued that it is an unfairinterpretation of the Review Body&apos;s recommendations for hospital doctors:their insistence on the importance of looking at career earnings suggeststhat - though they did not say so in so many words - they held back at the top in order to be able to do more for the junior doctors.   Moreover, if theBMA are unlikely to accept 13i per cent, they are a fortiori still moreunlikely to accept 10 per cent:   with all the risks described in paragraph 16.Other possible bases19.     We have considered whether there is any basis for compromise in someother figure between 13^ and 18 per cent.   Nothing greater than 13-g- per centcould be justified on the hospital doctor analogy;   and (as has been pointedout in paragraph 12), while it might be argued that some figure less than18 per cent would represent a fairer application of the general practitioneranalogy to the Service doctor, we can see no basis for saying precisely whatthat figure should be.   We cannot therefore suggest any basis for a compromiseoffer of, say, 15 or 16 per cent, in terms of analogy with NHS remuneration.-5-
Service dentists20.   Service dentists have since 1962 been paid at the same rates asService doctors, because target average net income of civilian general dental practitioners has not until now  been very different from average net income of civilian general medical practitioners.   By direct referenceto the WHS analogy it would be difficult to justify increases as high as20 per cent or as low as 10 per cent for Service dentists.   An increaseanywhere between 13 and 18 per cent could, however, be approximatelyreconciled with the Kindersley increases for dentists, and would thus makeit possible to retain the present parity between Service doctors and dentists,to which the Ministry of Defence attach importance.Presentation21.   The figures discussed in this note have been in terms of basic pay.It has to be borne in mind that Service doctors, like other officers, receiveother emoluments (free board and lodging or marriage and ration allowances).Since civilian analogues have to pay for board and lodging out of net income,it is not unreasonable to express increases in Service pay as percentages of total emoluments, as was done when the 1st April 1966 increase for theServices generally were announced at the beginnxng of this year.    On this basis the increases discussed in this note became:Basic pay Total emolumentsfo fo20 1513i 1010 7-1Phasing22.   It is agreed that any increase would be retrospective to 1st October 1966but not paid before 1st July 1967*   It is also agreed in principle that anincrease of the order considered in this note should be paid in instalments.The precise phasing will depend to some extent on the decision on total amount, and we have not therefore considered it.   In making any offer to theBMA it would be necessary, but at this stage sufficient, to make it clear thatthe principle of phasing, as laid down in Cmnd. 3150, would apply.15th December 1966-6-CONFIDEMT1AL
