]S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)67C(66) 154 COPY NO.9th November, 1966CABINETLOCAL AUTHORITY CURRENT EXPENDITURE(ENGLAND AND WALES) 1967^68 AND 1968-69Memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentThe Chancellor of the Exchequer in his memorandum (C(66) 152)argues that for the purpose of fixing the rate support grant cuts of 30 million and  45 million should be made in the local authorityestimates of expenditure on miscellaneous environmental services(including libraries) in 1967-68 and 1968-69, as revised by Depart-ments;    I have already agreed to propose cuts of  39 million in1967-68 and  47 million in 1968-69 in the estimates of expenditure onthese services; the cuts now proposed would be additional to these.These further cuts may not seem all that significant in the context ofan expenditure of around  2,5 00 million, but, if made, they will change the character of the negotiations with the local authority associations and call in question the good faith of the Government in implementing the proposals outlined in last February&apos;s White Paper.&quot;: jj&apos;.;.2.     The cuts which have been agreed by Departments are all cutswhich can be argued to be necessary to produce a realistic estimate,taking account of the economy measures announced in the summer;  onthis basis the negotiations with the local authorities would take the formof a reasoned examination of their estimates, as has been usual with thegeneral grant.    But it would be impossible to defend the additional cutsnow proposed on this basis, as a glance at the resulting expenditure figures will show.Expenditure on environmental services, after cuts(mid-1966 prices)  million1964-65 374    (actual expenditure)1965-66 411    (near-actual expenditure)1966-67 464    (estimate)1967-68 446    (       &quot;     )1968-69 463   !(       &quot;     )The estimate for the current year is based on the rate estimates andmust therefore be taken as representing what local authorities wereexpecting to spend, though it may be a little on the high side (say, up to2 per cent).     Allowing for this, it will be seen that the figurespostulate a drop in expenditure next year, followed in 1968-69 by a recovery to approximately the 1966-67 level.-1-S EC RET
3.      This is hardly credible, particularly after the rapid increaseof the past two years.    It is not merely that patterns of expendituredo not change overnight.    One of the main items included in this expenditure is loan charges.    The capital programme for this group of services next year is around  200 million and rather more the yearafterj,   which at today&apos;s interest rates means an increase in loan charges of about  14 million a year.     (The high cost of borrowing has also beena major factor in increasing expenditure in the last year or two).Sewerage accounts for over a third of this and must go ahead if we areto build new houses, schools, factories, etc.    Other major items arethe acquisition of land for slum clearance and re-development and grants for the improvement of existing houses, none of them fields inwhich local authorities can be accused of moving too fast.4.     In short, these estimates of rising expenditure do not representmajor improvements in services.    They account for no more than themaintenance of essential services (e, g. sewerage and refusecollection) and the continuance of existing policies (e. g. slum clearance).    There is very little scope for local authorities to reducethis expenditure next year or the following year.    If the further cutsfor which the Chancellor is contending are made it will mean inpractice that the ratepayers must bear a higher proportion of the costof maintaining existing standards.5.     In the longer term, no doubt, it would be open to the Governmentto tell local authorities that the national economy required reductions in the standards of local services or, at least, a much slower rate ofimprovement.     This could be done provided that Ministers wereprepared publicly to adjust their policies to the desired level ofexpenditure and sufficient time were allowed to make these adjustments.But if we impose further cuts in 1967-68 or 1968-69 we shall be accused of making quite unrealistic reductions in the estimates simplyin order to reduce the Exchequer grant.6.      This is the first round of the new grant system and thereforecritical for good relations between local and central government.    Butit is not only the local authorities we have to reckon with.    We have laid great emphasis on the need to lighten the burden of rates,particularly on the dome stic ratepayer.    If we make unrealisticcuts in the estimates - cuts which are not going to be reflected in actual expenditure - we shall be accused of going back on our promisesand shuffling off part of the burden back on to ratepayers.7, In my view we should content ourselves with those cuts whichcan be defended on their merits, without imposing the additional cutsdemanded by the Chancellor.A. G.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S. W. 1.9th November, 1966-2-SECRET
