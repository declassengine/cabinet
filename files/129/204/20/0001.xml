DcCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 120 COPY NO8021 November 1978CABINETRHODESIAN SANCTIONS:  FURTHER INQUIRYMemorandum by the Lord chancellor. The Ministerial Group under my chairmanship have now considered further the procedure for establishing an inquiry on the lines recommended in CP(78) 119.2. This has followed further consultation with the Clerks of both Houseswho have changed their advice and agreed that a Special Commissionestablished by Resolutions of both Houses is feasible although unprecedentedin several respects.    This could present difficulties in both Houses. So,however, could an attempt to pass a Bill to set up the Special Commissionand the Group preferred the Resolution procedure to legislation.SPECIAL COMMISSION ESTABU SHED BY RESOLUTION OF BOTH HOUSES3. Attached at Annex A is a draft Resolution for the House of Commonsprepared by the Attorney General.    The Resolution for the House of lords would be in similar terms.    The Clerk of the Parliaments and the Clerk ofthe House of Commons have said that the Resolutions, although unprecedentedin several respects (particularly as regards Lords procedures), are withinthe rules of order of both Houses.4. The normal practice is for Resolutions of both Houses to beintroduced first in the House of Lords.    However this is only a matter ofcustom and there are thought to be no constitutional objections to changing the practice and introducing the Resolution first in the House of Commonsfrom which the main demand for an inquiry comes.5. The Resolutions would however be subject to amendment, and suchamendments could fundamentally change the arrangements we intend. Itwould therefore be essential to obtain prior assurances from the officialOpposition that they would assist the passage of the Resolutions in the formproposed if this is the course decided upon.    In the last resort however theGovernment might have to make it clear to the House of Commons that theywould only release the relevant documents on the basis provided for in thedraft Resolution.1
ROYAL COMMISSION6. Attached at Ajuiex B is a note by the Home Office on the terms of a royal Warrant which would give effect to the criteria for a further inquiryset out in CP(78) 119.    The terms of the Royal Warrant itself which, asthe draft indicates, would set out the arrangements in regard to documents,would not be amendable.    Ajmex B also deals with the procedure which couldbe followed to permit the expression of Parliamentary approval for a RoyalCommission.    It will be noted that the procedure suggested would enableeach House, by means of a Humble Address, to discuss the proposal for a royal Commission so that it would not be a mere exercise of the royal prerogative.    The terms of the Humble Address could be confined toseeking approval for the setting up of the Royal Commission and statingmerely its terms of reference.    If it were thought helpful the names of theproposed members of the Royal Commission could be added to the Addressor announced in the debate.CONCLUSIONS7. Our problem has been to find a way of reconciling the essentialsafeguards set out in paragraph 3 of CP(78) 119 with the d2sirability of associating Parliament, and especially the House of Ccmmons, as closely as possible with the establishment of the inquiry.    The favoured view inthe Group was that this can best be done by a Special Commissionestablished by Resolution of both Houses provided that consultations withthe official Opposition show that the Resolutions could command a majority.If such assurances cannot be obtained, then the alternative would be toproceed by way of a Royal Commission which Parliament would be given anopportunity to approve but the Royal Warrant for which would not beamendable.E-lord Chancellors Office21 November 19782

That it be an instruction that all papers submitted to theSpecial -Commission shall first be examined by theirChairman who shall determine, if necessary after consultationwith other Members of the Special Commission, which ofthe papers should be seen by the Members of the special commission for the purposes of the Inquiry and which ofthe said papers and records should be shown to partiesinterested or their Counsel or agents, or to witnesses,and which of such papers and records may be retained byMembers of the Special Commission or such parties,Counsel agents or witnesses;Notes(1) It is not appropriate for one Eouse to purport to givepower to the joint body and this has made it necessarynot always to refer to the Special Commission as desired.But reference is made to the Special Commission, ratherthan the Commons Committee, wherever possible.(2) No mention is made of the chairmanship as it is considered- to be far better (and will avoid questions of order beingtaken) for the chairman to be. named in the Lords order and for this to come back to the Commons for their, concurrence.(3) It is not necessary to include in the Order an invitation to the Lords to concur in the setting up of the special commission.     Such an invitation is added as a bookentry after the House has agreed to the Motion.21.11.78
ANNEX note BY THE HOE CF? ICE1. This note discusses &quot;both the form of Royal Warrant needed to give effectto a Royal Commission to enquire into Rhodesian sanctions within the constraints set out in C?(78)  119 and of the form of Resolution needed to record Parliamentary approval of the Royal Commission,Terms of the Warrant appointing the Commission2. To illustrate how the terms of reference and procedural requirements which Ministers have in mind might &quot;be imposed, the Home Office have prepared:he draft Warrant annexed to this paper.   The reference in it to HumbleAddresses assumes that Parliament&apos;a endorsement of the proposal for a RoyalCommission will be expressed in that form, and that the Addresses (likeResolutions under the 1921 Act) will specify terms of reference only, notaenbership or procedure.   The provisions which are not normally to be foundin such Warrants, and have had to be drafted specially for this occasion, aresidelined.   Provisions normally included which have been omitted from this draft are those which authorise the Commissioners &quot;to inquire of and concerningthe premises by all other lawful ways and means whatsoever&quot; (which might beused as a pretext for circumventing the restriction on access to official documents by members other than the chairman) ;   &quot;to visit and personally inspectsuch places as you may deem it expedient to inspect&quot;;   and to make interimreports.   The provision inserted about allowing legal representation excep-ticnally assumes that Ministers envisage a witness1 a legal representative being present only when that witness is being examined, and not throughout the inquiry.Parliamentary approval3. As regards the form of the Resolutions, the Home Office make the point that,since the appointment of a Royal Commission is a Prerogative act, the usual form-or expressing the wishes of Parliament would be that of Humble Addressesto The Queen.   A precedent for such an Address - from the Commons above - inelation to the appointment of a Royal Commission (cited in SrsSeine May,*9th edition, page 599t footnote (i)) is to be found in connection with the&quot;C-yal Commission set up in 1 68 to inquire into certain matters concerningthe Metropolitan Board of Works.   The presentation of Humble Addresses would
necessarily precede the appointment of the Commission:   that would corrssp0-&quot;with the procedure for setting up a 1921 Act inquiryf and would avoid anyappearance of presenting Parliament with a fait accompli.   If Ministerspreferred that the Warrant set-sing up the Commission should be issued firs ithe terms of reference, membership and procedure would be settled before they could be the subject&quot;of debate in Parliament, and the approval of oneor both Houses could subsequently be expressed by the adoption of a motiontaking note with approval of zhe action of the Government in advising her to set up a Royal Commission.tfaj2
