Document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government cp(78) 126 copy no 305 December 1978cabinetLOW PAY:  THE CASE FOR A  3 UNDERPINNINGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for employment. I invite my colleagues to agree that in order to give negotiatorsadditional scope for helping the lower paid we should announce as soon aspossible a modification of the pay guidelines set out in the July White Paper&quot;Winning the Battle Against Inflation&quot;.2. The modification I propose would allow increases of up to  3 for a normal week where this i3 more favourable than either the existing low payexemption (which allows any increase so long as the resulting earnings leveldoes not exceed  44. 50 for a normal week) or the general limit of 5 per cent.Earnings in overtime and for juveniles and part-timers could be increased tomaintain existing proportions to earnings for a normal week.3. As with existing features of the policy, these would be limits, notentitlements.    If fully taken up, as I would generally expect, this modificationwould add only 0.1 per cent to the national wages and salaries bill over and above the existing provisions of the White Paper.4. The modification would potentially benefit some 5j million people(some 2 million full-time men, 2 million full-time women and Ij millionpart-timers, mostly women) ie those whose current earnings for a full weekexcluding overtime (c r the hourly equivalent for part-timers) are between 41. 50 and  60.    Those toward the lower end of this range stand to gainnearly an extra  1 per week.    Nearly 2y million stand to gain an extra 50por more.5. The main beneficiaries include about two-thirds of all local authority manual workers, over two-thirds of all National Health Service ancillary workers, nearly half of all Government industrials and of all nurses andmidwives, three-quarters of all agricultural workers and large numbers in distribution, various services, and the textile and food, drink and tobaccoindustries.    Details are given in the Annex.1
6. In my view we should announce this modification now a. to maintain public support for our policy in the event ofindustrial action by groups such as local authority manuals, who may otherwise gain sympathy as low paid workers just missing outon the existing low pay exception, which we have virtually concededdoes not go far enough.b. To keep the initiative ard minimise any appearance of concessions under duress later.c. To offer the possibility of significant additional help to largenumbers of employees in low paying industries, including substantial numbers of full-time men; this is of particular importance when onour own published forecasts prices will be rising faster than the5 per cent to which many of these employees, not benefitting fromproductivity deals, etc., would otherwise be held.d. In so far as others claiming to be low paid still do not benefit,to expose very clearly that this is because they are earning more than 60 per week, exclusive of overtime.7. The six Trades Union Congress (TUC) representatives on the national economic Development Council (NEDC) were against including such a proposal in the abortive draft joint Government/ TUC statement; it was thereforenever discussed by the General Council.    Their reasons and my counterarguments are as follow.a. The TUC remains opposed to pay limits of any kind. Thiswould, however, be a unilateral move by Government which at least some union negotiators would privately welcome.b. It would further erode differentials.    Unlike the existing 44. 50 it would not erode cash differentials at all, and the relativeimprovement would amount to only 2 per cent at the bottom of the range tapering smoothly to nothing at  60.c. It would run contrary to union negotiators who want to use thekitty principle to expand differentials.    There would be nothing toprevent the  3 being redistributed on a kitty basis within the groupconcerned, so long as none of the extra benefit went to those over  60.8. I accordingly recommend to my colleagues that the modification set outin paragraph 2 above be announced at the earliest opportunity, possibly inThursday1 s debate or by means of an early arranged Question.A E BDepartment of employment December 1978
