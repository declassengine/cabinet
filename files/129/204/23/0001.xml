DoCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 123 COPY NO28 November 1978CABINETEUROPEAN MONETARY SYSTEM:THE POUND STERLING AND THE IRISH POUNDMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. The creation of a European Monetary System could cause the link between sterling and the Irish Pound (the punt) to be broken.    The IrishGovernment clearly wants to join and hopes to persuade its Communitypartners to provide sufficient transfers of resources to enable the punt tohold its position in the parity grid.    They are very worried at the prospectof joining the exchange rate regime without us.    However, if we decide to stay out of it the indications are that the Irish might well go in without us.2. That would not be an easy decision for them.    The Irish economy isvery closely linked to ours.    Nearly half their trade (both exports and imports) is with us.   A large proportion of their industrial exports come tothe United Kingdom.    Almost a half of these exports are produced by Irishfirms with a turnover of one million punts or less and these companiesdepend on the British market to a much greater extent than larger concerns;they would also find more difficulty in coping with exchange risks.    It istherefore not surprising that a recent survey of Irish businessmen found that two-thirds favoured retention of the link with sterling.    Furthermore theRepublic has always looked to the United Kingdom as a centre for short termliquidity, depositing funds here as well as borrowing short term; similarlyit has looked to the United Kingdom as a source of long term capital. in both cases, the parity link has eliminated any exchange risk.    After a split,the attractions of the United Kingdom as a centre would be much moreuncertain - particularly as they will be affected by exchange control for thereasons explained below.3. It is possible that, when they are forced to the point of deciding,Irish Ministers will not be able to face the risks both of breaking the link with sterling and also of exposing the punt to the strain of keeping up with thedeutBchemark,    But we obviously cannot rely on that.    This paper isconcerned with the problems for the United Kingdom of a break in the linkand the contingency planning we have in hand.i
EXCHANGE CONTROLS4. The main problem for the United Kingdom arises from the fact thatthe break in the link would create an incentive for speculation on changesin the exchange rate between sterling and the punt.    It is not possible to predict what view the markets would take;  but it is probable that at certainperiods there would be expectations of an appreciation of the punt againststerling and that at other periods the reverse would be true.    The Irisheconomy would be very vulnerable both to inflows and outflows.   For thisreason the Irish have introduced legislation permitting them to imposeexchange controls against the United Kingdom.    Irish officials have told us privately that, once the link were broken, controls would be imposed on both outflows and inflows.5. Outflows from the United Kingdom to Ireland to take advantage of anexpected appreciation of the punt could take various forms.    Not all ofthem could be stopped by exchange controls - whether ours or the Republicf&amp;The breaking of the link between the two currencies is likely to result in a deterioration of the effectiveness of our exchange controls whatever we orthe Irish do.    This is the consequence of the especially close social andeconomic links between our countries, the large movement of people toand fro and the existence of a land frontier between Noithern Ireland andthe Republic.6. It is very difficult to say how much we could lose if the punt wasconfidently expected to appreciate against sterling.    But, as a rough guess,speculative flows could amount to something of the order of      billion. Asubstantial part of this might be stopped by effective exchange controls over(for example) the open position of United Kingdom banks in Irish pounds,Irish borrowing in sterling and the acquisition of Irish assets by UnitedKingdom companies.7. Irish officials have sought to persuade us that the United kingdom should refrain from imposing controls and to leave Ireland as one of the scheduled Territories under the Exchange Control Act.    It would clearly be in their interests for us to take that risk since they would retain access to sterling financinp and no new obstacle would be erected in the way ofUnited Kingdom investment in Ireland.    But we cannot be sure that the risk to our reserves and exchange rate would be acceptable.    The Irish have offered to administer their controls in such a way as to protect our interestsbut the Treasury and the Bank of England doubt whether they would, inpractice, be able to give us sufficient protection,     I have come to theconclusion that we must be ready to remove Ireland from the ScheduledTerritories if we find that substantial outflows to Ireland result from the breaking of the link.    I have therefore authorised the preparation of a contingency plan to apply exchange controls against Ireland - at short notice should the need arise.
8. It would be possible to administer these exchange controls in sucha way as to give the Irish a privileged position both in respect to the financing of direct investment in sterling and in respect of access to sterling borrowing.    A case could be made for complying with theirwishes in this way in order to preserve our special position in the Irishmarket and in order to mitigate the strain that a break in the link betweenthe currencies would undoubtedly cause.    But there are limits to what could be done without endangering our general exchange control defences.We also have to be able to defend more liberal treatment of Ireland tothose in our country and the European Economic Community (e.c.) whoare critical of the restrictive nature of controls over  transactions withthe rest of the world,    For this reason our contingency plans providefor the initial application of full exchange control with the possibility ofany easements being left to be dealt with later by administrative discretion.LEGISLATIVE IMPLICATIONS9o The imposition of exchange control on Ireland would require a treasury Order to be laid before Parliament excluding the Republic fromthe scheduled territories under the Exchange Control Act,    The Order is subject to negative resolution procedure.    I am advised trat applyingexchange controls to Ireland would require authorisation by the european commission under Article 108 of the e.c. Treaty (unless we were to actunilaterally in the first place under Article 109 which relates to a suddencrisis in the balance cf payments). Commission officials are now being consulted, on an informal and contingent basis.    We hope that theCommission will be co-operative.NORTHERN IRELAND10. A break in the link will create particular problems for NorthernIreland.    Firms in the province which have significant trade with the Southwill have to adjust to the complications of currency fluctuations and exchange controls.    There will be numerous transitional difficulties - inparticular determining which of the two currencies should be deemed toapply to existing contractual obligations and whether bank deposits aredenominated in punt or sterling.     On a smaller scale, there would almost certainly be problems for traders in the border areas who would have to adjust to a dual pricing system;   and practical problems would arise forthe owners of vending machines which a\. present accept both currencies.11. There would also be some political consequences flowing from abreaking of the link,  since both the Irish Government and the parties inNorthern Ireland may be expected to make what political capital they couldout of it.     The Irish Government and the minority in the North may seek to blame the United Kingdom.    The minority might argue that it was one more act designed to frustrate their long-term aspiration for a unitedIreland.    The Irish Government might in time, as the results of the breakbecome more apparent, seek to argue that they demonstrated that northern Ireland would be better off joined with the South.    The unionist3
majority in the North - particularly that section who looked for fullerintegration into the United Kingdom rather than a resumption of devolvedgovernment - would probably welcome the break as a strengthening ofNorthern ireland s ties with Britain.    Nevertheless,  such factors do not provide decisive arguments for either the Irish or United kingdom governments, although it will be important as far as possible to minimise the openings for political exploitation0GREAT BRITAIN12. Although the problems for British firms would be less important than those for Northern Ireland firms described above, quite a few wouldbe inconvenienced by a break in the link.    The administration of exchange control would have regard to the need to avoid unnecessary inconvenienceto firms - and this would be particularly important in the initial stageswhen everyone was adjusting to a new state of affairs.     The break-up of amonetary union is bound to be difficult.CONCLUSION13. The risks to the United Kingdom balance of payments and reserves of leaving Ireland within the Scheduled Territories af tex* the link withsterling has been broken are too great to be ignored.    I have thereforeauthorised the preparation of a contingency plan for the immediateapplication of full exchange control to the Irish Republic.    We cannot besure how things would turn out if the Irish Government decided to break the link with sterling.    Much would  depend on market expectations aboutthe relative future strength of the two currencies.     On the evidence available now, it looks as though we should sooner or later be obliged toapply exchange controls - though with the possibility of easements made in recognition of the traditional close links between the United Kingdom andIre 1 and o14. I am therefore seeking the Cabinet&apos;s authority to impose controlsif the link is broken and I judge that Irish controls would not provide sufficient protection for our exchange rate, our reserves and the viabilityof our general exchange controls.D W treasury Chambers28 November 19784
