ANNEX.THE PRISON SERVICES : PROPOSAL FOR AIT INQUIRYNOTE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOKE DEPARTMENTl-    It has for some time been clear to me that there is a pressingnee* for an inquiry into the Prison Services, which are in a stateof serious industrial unrest.   This has been given a new degree ofAgency by recent developments.    I attach at Appendix A a draft of aStatement which I should like to make in the House on 2nd Novemberbouncing the establishment of an inquiry.   This paper explains myMasons for this proposal and for wishing to make an announcement this. TA.-trison officers in England and Y/ales have for some time beensh0v,lriE an increasing willingness to resort to militant action, oftenPursuance of quite small claims and at local level without thedement of the national executive of the POA.   A disturbing featureOfecent disputes has been a willingness to put at risk the operationOf thaQ courts as well as control in prisons themselves. In July wevery near to a breakdown in the operation of the courts in LondonLX*e home counties. This was followed immediately by a threatenedoption of the courts in Birmingham as v/ell as London in pursuitAfferent claim. This was averted by referring the dispute toMcCarthy (who ruled against the POA). Over the last few weekse cells throughout the Metropolitan Police District and in some
Provincial forces have had to be used to accommodate young offendersdemanded by the courts whom the local branch of the POA will notad*it to the remand centre at Ashford, specifically as a protest against overcrowding and bad conditions There.   Earlier this monthstaff at Dartmoor walked out on two consecutive days and only^tumed to duty when the prisoners began to try to break down theirCeU doors.   They have now threatened that if, in accordance withUo*mai civil service practice, their pay is reduced in respect of thisabsence from duty, they will bring the whole prison to a standstill911(1 forcibly resist the entry of the police.3- ahthis has been brought to a head by a breakaway group of POA^ches (including Dartmoor) who are threatening disruptive actionft0m 5th November.    This has not got the support of their Associatione^ther we nor the Association know which branches are going to takei0ni what their precise objectives are, or what industrial actionPropose to take;   but it is likely to include threats to thethe courts.^he conditions under which the prison service are working oughte a matter of public concern.    There is a high level ofC3?owding, particularly in local prisons.   Many of the prisonsery old, and the accommodation is often quite inadequate bySent-day standards.   At the same time the number of violent and^Ptive prisoners continues to rise, and the recent rioLs at Hull^artree illustrate the risks the system is running.   All these
Actors have had their effect on the working conditions of prisonstaff, and it is understandable that they feel strongly about these improvements of conditions in the prisons would require an increase11 the resources available to the prison system.   But the POA feel^ the difficulties which they have been encountering are^tributable not merely to lack of resources but also to weaknessesstructure and organisation of the service, and consequently in(him thea6ement and industrial relations.   There are many other reasonsl6h levels of overtime at the expense of leisure time; - recruits***lacklnSing with them experience of industrial militancy elsewhere;theof opportunities for more constructive work) contributing toPresent militancy.   But there is no doubt that the primaryActive of the industrial action is higher pay, and that prisonstaf fare looking across at the recent police and fir3 service-^ftents.   This is an objective round which the national executive-^^ee of the Prison Officers Association, unable to control theirSsident branches, can sink their differences and coalesce.*he governors are becoming increasingly disenchanted with theion they are being asked to hold in the field (and with theirEditions of service).    Indeed, the Prison Governors1 Branch0f the  CPs have just written to me in strong terms pressing for an

Cur intention tohold an inquiry needs to be announced before the threatened action onKovember,As the Statement indicates, we shall need to consult the variousstaff associations on terms of reference.   A draft of what I have in^nd- is attached at Appendix B.    The Secretaries of State for^Cotland and Northern Ireland advise me that their prison services the other terms of reference would enable the inquiry toc**ld not De excluded from the ambit of any inquiry.   I see noIterative to including pay and conditions of service.   These are^ricably bound up with the problems I have described, and anySuiry which omitted them would lack any credibility with prison*er the main problems facinE the Prison Service without extending* to questions of sentence policy or alternatives to imprisonment.are important questions, which have a direct relevance to the***lems of the prisons.   But changes here could affect the state ofPrisons only over a considerable period of time.   Nor are weSWt of advice on them:   they have already been the subject of^ustive inquiry by other bodies.   What is now needed, as aSe^ate but parallel exercise to the inquiry I am proposing isSoa* means of focusing   judicial and public attention on these widerlogical issues and on the choices with which they present us.1 &quot;* considering how this can best he done, perhaps in the context01 the Government&apos;s reply to the Expenditure Committee or in aWished background paper for the inquiry.
9&apos;    We shall need to consider the composition of the inquiry.* envisage an independent committee of about ten members, to includePeople with experience of both sides of industry, the courts and the prison system e.g. a former governor and a member of a board ofvisitors.10-   An immediate announcement of an inquiry should reduce the scale of militant action as from 5th November.   But we must still be spared for the worst.   My officials have done a good deal of work0n contingency planning with help from other Departments.A appendix C summarises these plans.   It makes painfully clear the severe limitations on what could be. achieved, and thus underlines theCas* for an inquiry as a means of relieving the pressure which isding up.
I will with permission make a statement about the problems0^ the prison services.The House will be aware of the increasing strain under whiche staff of the prison services have been operating.    The reasonsr this are various and complex.   For many years now conditionsXl1 the prisons have been becoming more difficult, with increasing0Ve*crowd ing and a legacy of ageing and unsatisfactory accommodation.6 complete solution to these problems can only be found over apetlod of years.In the meantime, the problems of running the prison service^aVe called in question the structure of the system, and the way in&apos;kich it is organised and managed.    The strain has expressed itselfaccent months in a series of claims and disputes in the prison^-ces.    Not only has the resulting industrial action on occasion^terfepgd. with the functioning of the courts and the reception of^soners; it argues that the state of industrial relations in theSQn services has deteriorated as a result of the pressures, andSec*s to be thoroughly reviewed.    The time has come when thesecrs need to be comprehensively examined, together with the payconditions of service for orison staff on which they have a close
The recent report-of the Select Committee on expenditure has drawn attention to the pressures under which the prisonsystem is now having to operate, and the need to review variousstaffing matters.    The Prison Officers&apos; Association have urgeduPon me the need for an early and comprehensive inquiry, as indeedkave other staff associations.Against this background, my right honourable friends, the secretaries of State for Scotland and Northern Ireland and Iconsider that the time has come for an authoritative and independentReview of the prison services in the United Kingdom.   We have inmiud a review v/hich will be able to examine the structure,organisation and management of the prison system, as well asEditions in prison service establishments, and to consider inthat context the pay and conditions of service of the gradespeculiar to the prison service.    V/e shall be consulting theaPPr0priate staff associations immediately, and I will inform theHoUse about the composition and terms of reference to the inquiryas soon thereafter as possible.
INQUIRY INTO THE PRISON SERVICESTerras of Reference^0 inquire into the state of the prison services in the United^-Qgdom; and, having regard to:a)     the growth of the prison population, and the capacity of the prison system to accommodate it;^)     the requirements of secure custody and proper treatment ofprisoners;&apos;     the need to recruit and retain a sufficient and suitable staff for the prison service;^     the need to secure the efficient use of the manpower andfinancial resources available to the prison system.^0 examine and make recommendations upon:^     the structure and organisation of the prison system;*i) 4.1.&quot;cne management and use of resources m the prison services;conditions in prison service establishments;iv)the remuneration, conditions of service and working arrangements of the grades peculiar to the prison services;v)aspects of industrial relations particular to the prisonservices.
CONTINGENCY PLANNINGIf there were to be a complete withdrawal of labour by prison officers throughout the prison system, we should face a complete breakdown of control, and there would be very little we could do,beyond seeking the assistance of the police, and probably the armed forces as well, in restoring order in the prisons and.providing some^e ree of protection for the public.   This paper sets out what could^e done if industrial action by prison officers was on a more limited scale.Hithdrawal of labour at certain -orisons3A full, or partial, withdrawal of labour by prison officers in prison leaves only the small governing and administration staff toeP order among prisoners, to run the establishment and superviseCat-ering and other domestic tasks.    Such a situation is difficult to^^ain for more than a matter of hours and may lead to dangerousActing by prisoners. If prison officers remain unmoved in the faceOfsuch disorder and danger, the only remedy is to call in the policeCQUldmight not be able to prevent some damage and injury.   The policenot leave without risking a recurrence of trouble and would,erefore, have to maintain a presence in the prison while thedispute lasted.   That would tax police resources andcnce, and, if many prisons were affected for long, would be a severe strain.   There would be obvious difficulties about
replacing police with troops although, in extremis. servicemen mighthave to patrol perimeters to prevent escapes.Action inside -orisons3.    Industrial action, short of withdrawal of labour, could takeone or more of a variety of forms.    Some action internal to the prison (e.g. delaying building projects) only hits management. other measures - for example, closing workshops and confining prisoners to their cells - involves the risk of causing prisoner unrest; ifunrest escalates into violence, police assistance might have to becalled upon.Action to disrupt courts4.    A form of industrial action which is effective and is likely tobe used as it has been used in London prisons recently is a refusal to receive from the courts.X    The first line of defence in such a situation is to use cellsat police stations to hold prisoners refused admittance to prison.Contingency arrangements have been made to put these cells to thefullest use (for example, by having more than one prisoner in each).if the majority of prisons took this form of disruptive action,Mice cells could be swamped within one week.   The use of police cel&amp; this way is of questionable legality and imposes a great strain011 the police.
b*     The second line of defence is to ask courts to do all they canto reduce the number of prisoners being sent to prison - for example,granting bail in more cases and making utmost use of suspended^d deferred sentences.    But the scope is limited;    and it is not certain now far the courts would consider it proper to take such steps.-    A third step would be to set up temporary camps to takePrisoners for whom room could not be found in police cells. SeveralCa%s would be needed if the refusal to receive prisoners were to be widespread.    Governors and administration staff would be fully0c*upied elsewhere.   Unless we were prepared to use private securitytir*s, the police could presumably have to be called upon to ensureSecurity;    services would have to be provided by contractors or voluntary organisations.    If any camps could be commissioned in time,the most they might do is to contain limited disruption caused by,8a3r, the London establishments.    But there would be a risk that any&apos;eiapt to set up what would be seen as an alternative prisonHends^stei!i - no matter how small - would harden prison officer attitudeswiden the dispute.^   contingency legislationJ-f emergency legislation is to provide relief it would have toUQe powers to restrict new additions to the prison population;^d 4-no reduce the number of those already in custody.    It would -rdingly be necessary to limit the powers of the courts to commit
la.^ore people to custody by requiring them to suspend all sentences111 certain categories.    It would also be necessary for the executive^0 seek wide-ranging powers to discharge people from custodye*6. by the granting of bail after it had been refused by the courts03? by the selective release of prisoners before their sentence hadexPired.
