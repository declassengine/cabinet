Document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government cp(78) 127copy no. 5 December 1978cabinetPAY:  DISCRETIONARY ACTIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for prices and Consumer Protectionla Discretionary action has proved an important element of pay and counter inflation policy.     The Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy,Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations (EY(P)) is unanimously of the opinionthat it must remain as a demonstration of the Governments commitment to the policy and of our refusal to help finance the costs of unacceptablesettlements either through public purchasing or financial assistance. Theprospects of discretionary action certainly discourages completion of agreements outside the guidelines.     On a number of occasions it hasencouraged attempts to re-negotiate settlements which were initially abovethe White Paper figure.2. By its nature discretionary action involves the Government in makingjudgments about its application in specific cases.     In the past action hasnot been taken where we judged that employment objectives had greaterpriority, where the interests of particularly vulnerable or sensitive groupswould be jeopardised and where disproportionate damage would be done tothe Government by refusal to purchase.    Discretionary action possiblyavailable to the Government has never been taken when the Law officers or their officials raised the slightest doubt about the legality of the proposedsanction.    The Sub-Committee believe that these exceptions should be a continued feature of the policy.    Despite the proper application of theGovernments discretion the policy has been applied with general consistency,The Sub-Committee is strongly of the view that this consistency must be preserved.3. It has been argued that exemption from discretionary action shouldbe extended to companies which breach pay policy but undertake to holdprices down to the level consistent with a 5 per cent settlement. TheChancellor described in the House of Commons why such an exemption isnot possible.     Other companies, unable to apply the same price restraint,would be influenced by the overall settlement level and workers in a capitalintensive company would be given a much resented advantage over employeesdoing similar jobs in more labour intensive conditions.   The Sub-Committeewas unanimous in its rejection of this further option.     Such a change ofpolicy would be wholly inconsistent with the attitude which we adoptedtoward the Ford Motor Company.
4. Some criticisms of sanctions policy do not concern its content but itsalleged secrecy.    Consideration has been given to the possibility of publishing at least the names of companies against whom discretionary action is taken.    The Sub-Committee concluded that the publication of such a listwould create far more problems than it would solve.     Inevitably some of thelargest breaches of the pay policy will receive so much publicity that anannouncement of discretionary action will be unavoidable.    In such casesthe company must be told of the Governments intention to make its actionpublic.    In other cases the present rules should apply.R HDepartment of Prices and Consumer Protection5 December 19782
