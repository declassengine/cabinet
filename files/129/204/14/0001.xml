UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78)114 COPY NO gQ31 October 1978CABINETEUROPEAN MONETARY system memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. I attach a note by officials about the history of the proposal for a european Monetary System (EMS), about the negotiations and about the natureof the decisions we now face.2. The proposal for an EMS arose out of the troubles o.&apos; the dollar andGerman exasperation with United States policy in other fields as well.Chancellor Schmidt and President Giscard share a preference for fixedexchange rates and want to produce a zone of currency stability at leastWithin Europe.    President Giscard also wants to establish Franee as one ofthe two strongest members of the Community and to found a majorCommunity development on Franco-German agreement.    He also sees theEMS as a possible reinforcement for his domestic counter-inflation policy ata time when his fiscal policy is pushing prices up.3- The experts in the Central Banks and Finance Ministries of theCommunity countries were not seriously consulted before the proposals were originally launched in Copenhagen and remain deeply sceptical about thePossibility of producing a stable system which will include all members of theCommunity.    On the one hand the surviving members of the existing snake -Germany and certain countries closely linked with the German economy,Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg, Denmark and Norway (which is not a memberof the Community) - a-e unwilling to make any significant modifications in thelisting snake machinery.    The German Central Bank, in particular, whichcompelled to spend 10 billion deutschrnarks on intervention in support of^e snake between July and the recent October realignment of the snake,hereby seriously inflating its money supply, fears that any enlargement of the 8*ake would impose unacceptable burdens of intervention on Germany.    On theot*er hand, all the other candidates for membership of an EMS found it^possible to stay in the snake for long after joining it six years ago when theSaP between their inflation rate and that of Germany was far smaller than it istoday.    They therefore believe that an EMS should make available to theWeaker countries credit in support of intervention at least three times largerth*n that now available to the snake (8. 5 billion European units of account)
want the main burden of intervention to fall on Germany, on the ground thatthe weakness of the dollar is likely to exert a stronger upward pressure onthe deutschmark than on any of the weaker currencies in the Community.4- There is in fact a contradiction between the motives which led to theP-opc.ia.ls for the EMS and the interests of the weaker European currencies.The deutschmark along with the Swiss franc and the yen is one of the three major currencies into which holders of dollars want to diversify so long as the dollar is weak.    Consequently the gap between the exchange rate of thedeutschmark and other Community currencies is likely to widen unless someoffsetting action is taken through intervention or through changes in economicand financial policy.    Germany would like to share some of the burden of becoming a currency of refuge with the Community partners with whom shedoes most of her trade.    She sees offsetting action by Germany alone asentailing a risk of inflation, either because Germany would have to expand her own economy toe rapidly or because large-scale use of deutschmarks forintervention would require the Bundesbank to increase the German moneysupply.    Germany would therefore like to see some sharing of the inter-vention burden with other European currencies.    She wants, btill more, to8ee changes in the economic policies of Community partner? to bring theirinflation rate and balance of payments performance closer to that of Germany.Both must make their currencies more attractive and better able to match thedeutschmark.    Accordingly, the Germans want to see an EMS which shareslntervention obligations instead of placing the lion&apos;s share on Germanybecause the deutschmark is divergent;  and which imposes strict economicdisciplines because without them weaker countries will run out of reserves and fall into debt.    In this situation Germany has not seemed ready to change*he snake mechanism sufficiently to enable the countries which have had toeave it now to rejoin without serious risk;  or to develop a different system to run alongside it.    Representatives of non-snake Governments reasonablycomplained at the last meeting of the Finance Council that it had been open tothem to rejoin the snake at any time in recent years without any majorMultilateral negotiation, and they would have done so if they had felt it was intheir interest.If we are unable to shift the German position in the coming weeks, i could not advise my co\leagues to join the EMS.    France, Britain, Italy and^eden have all had to leave the snake, usually with heavy losses of reserves,^rance has left twice.    It is true that in the early months of an EMS theerrnans and the French could be expected to make particular efforts to avoid18 history from repeating itself.    It is also true that the balance ofPayments positions of the United Kingdom, France and Italy are at the moment^atisfactory and that progress has been made in reducing inflation, though in,rance inflation is now rising again.    But the general environment is worsean in the early days of the snake:  inflation differentials between Germany^d the other three major countries are larger, movements of the dollar, thet^a   &apos; the yen and the Swiss franc exceed the rate of currency movements ine past and the funds which can move to affect exchange rates are vastlyarger.
6- So far as the United Kingdom is concerned it is likely that, even if wesucceed in reducing our inflation rate further and the German rate risessomewhat, a substantial inflation differential between us will remain.    It isalso likely that Germany will go on running a much larger surplus andachieving better productivity than the United Kingdom.    With time this couldchange, but the gaps are unlikely to close within a year or two.    In spite ofthis it is possible that initially sterling might be rather stronger inside theEMS than outside it because the market would see us as having Germansupport for our rate (although if the markets thought we would be unable to sustain our previous rate inside the EMS a decision to join might also put pressure on our rate).    But on a slightly longer time scale the economicoifferences between the United Kingdom and Germany mean that in an enlargedsnake there would have to be sterling devaluations against the mark (or markaPpreciations against sterling).    These would be step-changes of some political significance which would probably be linked with similar changes forother member currencies.    I believe that, provided our policies are right -and the proviso is crucial - we can achieve these changes more flexibly andquietly through the market outside the system than in an enlarged snake.Moreover we would not have to spend reserves on keeping the deutschmarkdown if we were outside the system.In terms of our effective rate (against a trade-weighted basket ofcurrencies) we have enjoyed considerably currency stability since thebeginning of 1977 in spite of the major movements in other importantcurrencies.    Like France and Italy, we have appreciated against the dollarbloc and depreciated against the strong currencies, including the mark.Because the markets have been content with our policies throughout thatPeriod, sterling is now within 3 per cent of where it was at the beginning of*977, and in 20 out of the last 22 months has moved within a range of under^2 per cent either side of 62. 5 effective.    If we had been linked to the markthere would probably have had to be at least two currency step-changes to achieve this result.oI would not recommend that Britain should stay outside the EMS inOrder to be free to pursue a policy of sterling devaluation.    On the contrarybelieve that reliance on devaluation to compensate for excessive inflation issoft option which brings no lasting benefit to the economy.    I believe thatwe should lean against devaluation rather than towards it.    But experienceas shown that Governments have only a limited ability to manipulate theire*cbange rate either up or down.    In particular, intervention cannot do morean smooth out erratic fluctuations in the exchange rate.    The underlyingeconomic realities are bound to mean that in a floating regime we depreciateagainst some currencies over a period even if we appreciate against others -as in the last 18 months.9For this reason, if we decide to stay out of the EMS when the outcomethe negotiations is clear and we want to avoid a depreciation which would beamaging to our inflation rate and to the prospects for our pay policy, it willmore than ever necessary to convince the exchange market that our
economic and monetary policies are right.    This will be especially important in the early months since we shall have to convince people that wehave not stayed out of the EMS because we see ourselves as too weak to go in.In particular, although our inflation rate is at present lower than that ofFrance and Italy, we must ensure, by keeping it there, that if they join thesystem without us sterling is not then singled out for attack.    We havealready made the fight against inflation our first priority since it is aprecondition for continuing and accelerating the present reduction in umemployment.    In fact, the proposals for an EMS, until the market begin tosee them in perspective, will impose greater discipline on us whether we accept them or not.l0-       If Cabinet decides it is likely that our decision will ultimately be against entry, we shall need to consider separately how we can best protectour political and economic interests and minimise both the appearance andreality of isolation within the Community both in the remaining stages of thenegotiations and beyond.    This will be particularly important if we want to preserve the option of joining the EMS at a later stage.D W HAreasury Chambers31 October 1978
(secret)annex proposed EUROPEAN MONETARY SYSTEMNote by Treasury officials^ J^oposalThe proposal for a European Monetary System (EMS) was put forwardky Chancellor Schmidt and President Giscard at the European Council aternen on 6/7 July 1978.      The text of the relevant part of the Bremen0rmnuniquea and of the Annex outlining the proposal, is attached to^78)115.      The concept was to set up a system in which the Exchanget   es of the Community countries (and associated countries acceptednto the scheme) would be held within agreed margins.      To achievethig *  * ** the authorities in each country would be ready to intervene in une exchange markets to influence the exchange rates of theirUrrencies.      They would also pursue policies which would help the ability of their currencies.      Settlement of intervention debts^   ieen Central Banks in the system would be carried out in European^ rrencv Units (ECU)*.      An initial supply of ECU^would be issuedCentral Banks against deposit of 20% of dollar and gold reserves.J-n addition it was proposed that substantial credit (about55 billion EUA) should be available to support the system.      It wasaged that not later than 2 years after the start of the scheme,roPean Monetary Fund should be set up to consolidate the existing^unity settlement and credit mechanisms..The ECU was to have the same definition as the EUA, which*s a &quot;basket&quot; unit of Community currencies.    Its currentalue is about  0.68 and, for example sterling at present hasweight in it of about 12.85 and the German mark of about*2%.      Tne weights vary constantly with changes in the marketalue of currencies.      Other possible definitions of the ECU,jUch would produce a different composition from the presenthave since been discussed.- 6 -(secret)
(secret)3. It was proposed that changes in exchange rates byond the agreedmargins should be subject to mutual agreement.4. The countries now operating the Joint European Float (the &quot;Snake&quot;*)made clear that this arrangement would be continued until they were satisfied that it could be subsumed in the new system.5. It was proposed that the European Council should take a finaldecision on the scheme on 4/5 December 1978 after study of thedetails by Finance Ministers and officials.    It was assumed that ifit &quot;were decided to go ahead, the scheme would start on 1 January 1979*It was further agreed (at the Prime Minister*s insistence) that thereshould be &quot;concurrent studies&quot; of the action needed to strengthen the economies of the less prosperous member countries in the context ofan EMS.Prime Minister&apos;s Statement6. On 10 July 1978 the Prime Minister told the House of commons that the Heads of Government at the European Council had agreed that&quot;a zone of monetary stability in Europe was a highly desirableobjective, as part of the concerted international action needed for economic recovery&quot;.    He also made clear that, in common with a numberof other Heads of Government at the European Council, he wished tosee the details fully worked out before entering into any commitment.Governments view was that any new system must be durable and take full acco\int of the economic as well as monetary interests of each member of the Community-Bremen Negotiations7*   UK. officials have joined in discussions by the e.c. MonetaryCommittee of the possible provisions of an EMS, and izr.meetings of the 1Economic Policy Committee which is carrying out the &quot;concurrentstudies&quot;, all on the &quot;no commitment&quot; basis referred to in the^ime Minister&apos;s statement.    The Committee of e.c. Central Bank*Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Netherlands. Norway,though not a member of the e.c., is also in the Snake. Prance,Italy, the UK and Sweden have all been members of the Snake(Prance twice) but have felt obliged to leave it.    The UK joinedin May 1972 and left after 7 weeks.- 7 -
(secret)Governors and its sub-committees have also considered the proposed scheme.      The Chancellor of the Exchequer has attended monthly meetingsof the Finance Council which has received reports on this work andsupervised it.Criteria for judging the Scheme8. Early in September, GEN 136 approved a paper setting out criteriaby which whatever scheme eventually emerged might be judged. Thesecriteria were developed from guidelines also approved by GEN 13^ anddeployed by the Chancellor at the Finance Council.    mhe negotiations are not yet complete, even at technical level, and we cannot exclude the possibility of changes in position before or during the DecemberEuropean Council.     However, given that national positions on mostissues now seem fairly clear and important decisions have alreadybeen taken at Finance Council level, it seems reasonable to assume that the shape of the scheme now favoured by most countries will not now be fundamentally changed, and that it can usefully be assessedagainst the criteria.     These criteria were grouped under h main headings.9. The first heading concerned the characteristics of the scheme:Vot)ld it reduce or increase the existing constraints on growth?Would it be likely to survive initial pressure and endure thereafter?Would it provide sufficient balance of obligations between creditorsand debtors, strong and v/eak?     Would it contain enough credit onthe right terms?   V/ould it make adequate provision for necessary changes in exchange rates?   Would it provide or lead to sufficientresource transfers in our favour?   And was it likely to develop,in operation, in the way we would wish?10. The answers, to date, are not encouraging.      ^he scheme seems todiffer little in essentials from the existing snake, which in thePast lost three major members under pressure.      Our efforts tonegotiate versions of the exchange rate system which would automaticallyPlace a &quot;divergent&quot; strong currency under pressure, and so give realPromise of a balance of obligations between the stronger and theWeaker countries, have not succeeded.     The prospect, at Bremen,that large amounts of credit would be readily available to supportthe system from the start is still under discussion, but it now contains no real &quot;reserve pooling&quot; element, and the Bundesbank isncw arguing for a real addition to Community credit which is little
(secret)aore than half that which seemed to be envisaged at Bremen.There is provision for exchange rate change by mutual agreement, andit is recognised that in extreme situationsthere may have to be&quot;temporary absence&quot; from the system.   But provision for unilateralexchange rates is not negotiable and the model for such changes whichthe Germans, the other snake countries and the French have in mind ischanges in the present snake.   The discussions in EPC have made itclear that we can expect at most only limited resources transfers ofthe kind we have in mind in the near future.   There is still aPossibility that we may achieve some general recognition that the policies of the Community as a whole, including the budget, should help to improve &quot;the economies of the less prosperous countries, but there isstill argument about how far bur partners recognise us as &quot;lessProsperous&quot; for this purpose and any gains would be spread over a long period.H. As to the general operation of the scheme, the Germans haveincreasingly stressed the inflationary risks to their economy of having to provide large amounts of deutschemarks for intervention to maintaincurrency relationships.   This has also affected their attitude to thescale of credit. These views, together with a reluctance to expand theireconomy faster for fear of inflation by that route, lead the Germans and**t least some other snake currencies to lock for greater counter-inflationary discipline in the weaker countries as the main means ofspacing out currency changes.    The negotiations (including bilateral^etings like that at Aachen) have not provided much indication of a^adiness to operate the scheme to accommodate the interests andfroblems of all members of the Community.&apos;d* The second group of criteria concerned the relationship with thel0Hd economy:    what effect would the scheme have on the dollar, the IMFs^ the international monetary system;    and what would be the impact on^rld growth.   Here the answers are somewhat less discouraging. The: paans refuse even to discuss a &quot;dollar policy&quot; for the system, or any^vision in it which would have the effect of pegging or underpinningdollar.   This is understandable, given what could be involved in an&apos;ty)rt to maintain a particular link with the dollar. Nevertheless,leased stability in Europe could only be helpful, in the long run,^th to the international monetary system and to the world economy:^ there is little indication that the ECU.is going to develop,^ the near future, into a rival asset to the dollar.(secret)
(secret)In the shorter term, if the system operates to keep down the DMand firm up other European currencies, the US might suffer some lossof competitiveness against the strongest European exporter but gainagainst others.    More disquieting, however, is the prospect that,in its initial impact at least, the scheme is likely to operate with adeflationary bias over a period when world economic growth will in anycase be slow.   As for the IMF, the Fund staff are concerned lest theBIS and EliF weaken the role of the Fund at the centre of theinternational financial system, make it an agency mainly for less developed countries, reduce the European funds available to it,restore a monetary function to gold and prejudice the development ofthe SDR.   The point about continued use of the IMF, and support for it,by the European countries is important but given goodwill, thereneed be no insuperable problem over making the EMS system compatiblevith and complementary to- the IMF.13.   The remaining criteria considered by Ministers concerned the impact on the UK and on UK economic policies:    how much are both the nominal and real effective exchange rates for sterling likely todiffer, on average, within the proposed EMS from what they would beoutside it;    what contribution membership would make to counteringinflation;   whether the scheme would he likely to produce greaterexchange rate stability and how great would be the benefits flowing fromgreater stability;    what would be the effects of membership oncompetitiveness, the balance of payments and output;    and what wouldbe the political and economic implications for the UK of stayingout of the EMS if it were joined by at least Germany, the rest of thepresent snake, and France.    These points are covered in paragraphs 27-37of this note.^*   The final heading of the criteria considered by ministers concerned the Parliamentary and political implications of joiningQr not joining.   The Attorney General1s advice on legal/Parliamentary^pects is at paragraph 32 .jgtest Negotiating Position&apos;5* In negotiation the aim has been to apply the principles of theGovernment&apos;s position to the exchange rate system itself, to the credit mechanisms and to the &quot;concurrent studies&quot;.   All three aspects- 10 t
(secret)should achieve an equitable balance of obligations between strongerand weaker countries, should avoid a deflationary bias in the whole system and should not prevent remaining real disparities in economicperformance from being reflected in exchange rates.16.   On the exchange rate scheme, the UK first argued with some successfor relating currencies to a &quot;basket&quot; of European currencies ratherthan to a parity grid system like that used in the snake.    The &quot;basket&quot;system would impose intervention obligations on any individual currencynoving away from the Community average, the parity grid system requiresintervention by two countries acting together:    one &quot;stronger&quot; andone &quot;weaker&quot;. There v/as French, and Italian and some other support forthis approach.    It was however apparently agreed by Chancellor Schmidt and^resident Giscard at Aachen that the parity grid should be used forintervention in the system but that, in accordance with a BelgianProposal (the &quot;Belgian compromise&quot;), the ECU &quot;basket&quot; should have aseparate role in the system as an &quot;indicator of divergence&quot;.    When a currency diverged significantly from the movement of the weightedaverage of other Community currencies as represented by the ECU, certainconsequences v/ould follow.    This &quot;Belgian compromise&quot; was accepted atthe September Finance Council, with the UK alone in opposing it.1?.  Argument continues on how the &quot;Belgian compromise&quot; should operate^ in particular cn the consequences when the basket indicatorbeatifies a currency as divergent.   The Germans (whose currency is the:ost likely &quot;divergent&quot;) accept consultation without any obligation to act.-French/Belgians speak of a &quot;presumption&quot; of action.    Britain, Italy^Ireland have agreed for an obligation &quot;to intervene, coupled with afeezing&quot; for the time being of intervention debts due to the &quot;divergent&quot;t0Untry where the intervention arose out of its divergence. It^ems unlikely that the Germans will move significantly on this point.^&apos; Credit.   The position is described in paragraphs 16/18 of the^se of Commons paper circulated with Cp(78)H5.      It is^sible that the Germans will move towards the position of other^bers on credit, perhaps at the European Council on 4/5 December.&apos;^ It is in the light of this that we conclude that the german .S1Uon, accepted by President Giscard, is that the EMS will in essence.uexpansion of the snake, with some further consultations on- 11 -
(secret)intervention policy and economic management and with an expansionof credit.*he Concurrent Studies20. In this area we have argued that Community policies at presenttend to exacerbate the divergence between the economies of member states,rather than contribute to their convergence, by leading to a nettransfer of resources from the less prosperous to the richer member states.   This situation needs in any case to be remedied, but the need is even more urgent in the context of an EMS, which would put furtherstrain on the countries with weaker currencies.21. This line of argument has not been fully accepted by a majorityof member states.    For the Germans the preferred method of resourcetransfers is loans by the European Investment Bank, though these haveto be serviced and repaid.   The interests of Italy and Ireland differ from ours.   They want- improved receipts from the Social and Regional?unds and more investment flows.   We are more interested in a reductionQf our heavy net budgetary contributions, including contributions toCAP costs.    We might gain something from larger Social and Regional^unds but our main effort has to be directed to getting the EuropeanCouncil to acknowledge that existing budgetary flows are perverse astor as the UK is concerned.    Over a period this could be valuabletot we have no certainty of achieving it and no prospect of immediatebelief.  view of CAP22. Following a request by Heads of Government at Bremen (mainly the*Hme Minister and Signor Andreotti), the Commission are conducting8 review of the CAP.    This review is independent of the EMS proposal^d is to take account of Italian views on the treatment of&quot;mediterranean agriculture.    The UK will clearly wish to see this reviewteued vigorously whether we join an EMS or not, though there is a with our argument about the need to change the perverse effects01 the Community budget in the context of an EMS.    The commission s^iew has not yet been submitted.    Our aim is to secure agreement by^ end of the year at least to a freeze on the prices of agriculturalp?oducts in surplus.- 12 -(secret)
(secret)^^circumstances of the choiceAs matters stand President Giscard and Chancellor Schmidt seem^termined to set up an EMS, whether the UK joins or not.      Nor canDe certain that if we do not join, Italy and Ireland will alsost&amp;nd out (though there is a possibility that one or both might). Thec^Qice, therefore, may be between joining the system and being the only^er state not to join.While the concurrent studies are important, the benefits we arein from them in the context of the EMS negotiation canar(Uy be sufficient to compensate for the wider disadvantages of anSatisfactory EMS.      This is true also of the CAP review, to the^xtent that there is any link with the EMS negotiation.    This suggests* from the economic side, the decision whether to join should be^ade ^on the merits of the EMS proposal itself.Within the e.c., divergence of economic performance is now greaterwhen the snake&quot; was originally set up in 1972.    The range ofation rates is between Italy at 13% and Germany at 2\%.Verj the size of the three manor potential new members (Prance,^3 UK), the different orientation of their economies, and theVin^ability of each of them to different, sets of external pressures,make a community-wide monetary system different in kind from the^    41   snake, which is based on a natural Deutschemark trading zone.Edition, the amount of money available world-wide for speculationSain^^ currencies has greatly increased since 1972.

Left to themselves, the European currencies wouldo       a differently to changes in the value of the dollar.&apos; Most^oy currencies would move at an intermediate rate between theement 0f the mark and the movement of the dollar.

(secret)^Pjocations of joining an EMS*   The first implication of membership is that sterling ceases to0at as freely as at present and parity changes become matters ofp0^political decision and negotiation with partners.    The rate can beRanged and the Germans, on whom some of the supoort burden wouldxt might be ready to see such changes if and when our rate came under heavy pressure.      But the essence of an EMS is that participants^e greater efforts to resist exchange rate changes and support theircts with appropriate policies.28..  Ro . .Decause of the backing of the system, we might in face of axate attack have more control of our own rate and be able to defendbetterCI a rate we wished to defend.      We would however have lessXlMlity in the face of a major attack, when a rigid position coulddually invite speculation.      We could be exposed to heavy reserveCbj or to increasing our already heavy external debt, with less^oom fv,-lor manoeuvre on the exchange rate itself.      Substantial reservenas usually been a ticket.of entry to snake devaluation, but ofoc there are risks of reserve loss outside an EMS also.

(secret)if the markets thought we would be unable to hold our present exchangeinside the EMS, a decision to join might lead to pressure on our^change rate. &apos;A third.implication is that we would be participating in aInaj0r Community initiative, would escape isolation on it and enhance^nances of negotiating advantages for the UK in other Community(Js*     We would have a chance of benefiting from the &quot;convergent^Utfies&quot;, would escape difficulties with Ireland and would have someQf influencing the evolution of the scheme from within.

Over the whole period since the beginningOf &quot;I-^^77 the sterling exchange rate has moved relatively little inrelation to a basket of currencies weighted for the direction of our trade for example, within a band of about 3% in the last 6 or 7 months.eriing has appreciated against the dollar and depreciated againste niark.    Outside the EMS sterling would not be pinned to the^e*man mark and would not therefore require the step devaluations whichWould be necessary at intervals so long as our economic performancees not improve sharply in relation to Germany&apos;s.    Such stepValuations tend to be political as well as economic acts and toQuire negotiation, commonly after substantial loss of reserves.?he second implication would probably be that over a period our.   nange rate would be somewhat lower on average than it would benside the EMS.    The exchange rate adjustment system in the EMS isended to lean more against exchange rate changes, up or down,would happen in a free float.

For example, our chances ofp    ring changes in Community policies, including adjustment of the^Unity Budget mechanisms in our favour, might well be reduced.int   Countr^es which did join the EMS would regard it as in theire**ests to criticise us for not doing so.    The degree of ourSolat--i10n from others in the Community would be considerably reducedf,     aj-v and Ireland stayed out with us.    They will however makedecision on the basis of their own interests and we are unlikelythe^6 able t0 influence them more than marginally, except insofar asy regard our own decision as important to them in itself.- 16 -(secret)
