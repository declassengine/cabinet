HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 131COPY MO15 December 1978CABINETA NATIONAL HERITAGE FUNDNote by the Chief Secretary, treasury. I attach for the information of members of the Cabinet the draftof a White Paper to be entitled &quot;A National Heritage Fund&quot; which Ipropose that I should present to Parliament on or about Tuesday next19 December 1978.    This follows policy decisions taken in the Home and social Affairs Committee and the text has been cleared with that Committe2. I draw the attention of members of the Cabinet to the point that ifthe National Heritage Fund is established as I propose, the financial arrangements will involve a charge on the Contingency Reserve ofapproximately  10 million in 1979-80, the year in which we expect theFund to be established.    I am prepared to accept this charge.J treasury Chambers15 December 1978
A NATIONAL HERITAGE FUNDThis White Paper sets out the Government&apos;s proposals for establishing aNational Heritage Fund to replace the present National Land Fund.   It replies to the Third Report from the Expenditure Committee (Environment Sub-Committee)of Session 1977-78 in which the Committee consider the position of the NationalLand Fund, and make recommendations.Our HeritageThe Committee&apos;s Report cannot be looked at separately from the Government&apos;soverall policy in relation to our national heritage.   The Government&apos;s aim is tomaintain and enhance all aspects of our heritage, including our countryside,historic buildings and their contents, and major works of art.   And preservationand improvement are not the sole objectives;   our heritage is there to be enjoyedand appreciated by as many people as possible.The Government already devote considerable resources to this policy. Some 100 million a year is laid out on our heritage.   About nine tenths of thisgoes towards displaying and looking after historic buildings and works of art,while the remainder goes towards the acquisition of new assets.   In addition thereis a further contribution of about  10 million a year by way of exemption fromtax on heritage objects.   This helps to keep historic property in private handsin return for undertakings to preserve the property and to provide for publicaccess.iThis is the context in which the National Land Fund, and the recommendationsof the Committee, must be considered.   The National Land Fund, though not big inits total effect, was as the Committee point out established with certain specificintentions in mind.   It has in its J52 years life played a useful part.   But the1.
Government accept that the Fund&apos;s position is not clearly understood, and,more important, that the statutory and other limitations under which itfunctions prevent it from making the full contribution which it might inthe furtherance of heritage policy.   The Government agree that changes are needed.The National Heritage fund the Government have accordingly decided that the National Land fund should be wound up and that a National Heritage Fund should be established in its place.   The Government propose to introduce legislation to give effectto this as soon as possible.The National Heritage Fund will be vested in a small number of Trustees.The Trustees will include some laymen and some who are well informed about,though not necessarily expert in, the area in which they have to operate.Scottish, Welsh and North Irish interests will be represented.   The Trustees,who will be supported by a small independent staff, will be appointed for limited periods by the Secretary of State for   /. TheSecretary of State will in this and all matters connected with the Fundestablish and maintain close liaison with other Ministers with responsibilities in the heritage field.The Trustees will be empowered to make grants and loans to those bodieswithin the United Kingdom, such as national and local museums, the NationalTrusts and the National Parks Authorities, which can at present be helped by theNational Land Fund.   In general terms the grants or loans will be to assist inthe purchase of, and in certain cases to go towards providing endowments for,historic buildings (together with their contents where appropriate), scenic,scientific and historic land, works of art and other heritage objects. in deciding whether or not to make a grant or loan the Trustees will be requiredto have regard to the maintenance of our national heritage and to the desir-ability of encouraging the maximum reasonable public access to the land,buildings or objects which are to be acquired.   Scottish and Welsh bodieswould continue to be eligible for assistance from the Fund after devolution.2.
So far as works of art go the role of the Fund will essentially be to supplement other sources of moneys to which the various eligible institutionshave or could have access.   The Fund will normally require bodies seekingassistance in these cases to contribute a reasonable proportion of the co6tfrom their own resources.   In the case of a request from a major nationalinstitution this might be of the order of one-half (and the institution may wish it to seek part of this by public appeal); for other museums and galleries, where resources may be more limited, a different proportion maybe appropriate.The trustees will be expected to deal with major items of the nationalheritage, although certainly in the initial stages   an exceptional house and contents of undoubted national importance could be offered which would impose such demands as to outstrip the resources of the fund or deplete itin an unacceptable way.   Such a proposal would have to be decided by theGovernment directly, taking account of appropriate advioe as to theimportance of the house as part of our heritage;   and if following this theproposal were to be pursued the Government would find the necessary financedirectly, wherever in the United Kingdom it may arise.Functioning of the FundParliament will be asked to vote the Fund an annual grant in aid, to bepaid in full at the start of each financial year.   The site of the grant in aid will be planned by the Government, at the time of the annual public expenditure survey, for the four years ahead covered by the survey.   The grant in aid will score as public expenditure when it is paid to the Fund. the trustees will be able to carry over unspent balances from year to year. Unspentamounts at any time will be invested as directed by the Treasury, and interestwill accrue to the Fund.Since the Fund&apos;s role will be to assist other institutions, the Trusteeswill not be enabled themselves to acquire or hold any property (other thanunspent balances and assets necessarily needed for administrative purposes),nor will they have any power to borrow money or give guarantees.   They will however have power to invite and accept moneys from non-Government sources.3.CONFIDENTIAL
The Trustees will have a duty to inform the Secretary of State in advanceof any proposal where the total assistance involved exceeds levels specified byhim from time to time;   initially these levels might be of the order of  1 million in the case of land and buildings (including contents), and  2^0,000 for each individual item in other cases.   The Secretary of State will have the powerto direct the Trustees not to proceed in such cases, but unless he did so the trustees would proceed as they proposed.In addition the Trustees will have a duty to inform the Secretary ofState in advance of any proposed expenditure which take total outgoingsin any year above a specified level;   but, again, would proceed with theassistance unless the Secretary of State directed them not to.   The level would be fixed by reference to the year&apos;s grant in aid and might vary fromtime to time;   initially it might be of the order of one year&apos;s annual grant,that is,  5 million.Subject to the two preceding paragraphs, the Trustees will be empoweredat their sole discretion to meet expenditure on purposes within their termsof reference up to the limit of the amount in the Fund at any one time.The Trustees will prepare an annual Report and Accounts, which will include a list of grants and loans made for acquisitions and endowments showingboth the total cost of the acquisition and the contribution made by the Fund.The Accounts will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and willbe laid, with the Report, before Parliament.   The Secretary of State will beanswerable for ensuring that the conditions of the grant in aid are observedand that the Trustees have created the necessary machinery to observe theseconditions.   The Trustees will be ans^rable for individual decisions onacquisitions and for the efficient and economical management of the Fund.FinanceIn considering the finance to be made available to the National HeritageFund the Government have taken into account a number of considerations. Theprovision to be made to the new Fund must be consistent with policy on thetotal of public expenditure and with the priorities to be observed within
the total.   The Fund should have sufficient means at its disposal to carryout its role, but that role is intended to be supplementary to other measuresto preserve the heritage, to which considerable resources are already beingdevoted.   It is not part of the Fund&apos;s role to contribute substantially toexceptionally expensive proposals.Taking all these considerations into account the Government have con-cluded that the Fund should be provided on its creation with a sum equal tothe free balance then standing on the National Land Fund, which it is estimatedwill be about  15 million;   and further that an amount of  5 million annually,revalued, should be provided for each of the financial years after the firstup to and including 1982-83.   This compares with a current rate of spending by theNational Land Fund of between  2 million and  3 million.   The right level of provision which the National Heritage Fund will need to carry out its functionscan only be assessed in the light of experience;   accordingly the annualprovisions now made do not necessarily mean that a different level might notbe appropriate for the future.TaxationThe Government have concluded that under the new arrangements it will contribute more simply and effectively to the preservation of our heritageif the system of acceptance of property in lieu of capital transfer tax i6replaced by an expanded system for private treaty sale6.   Acceptance in lieu was first introduced in 1911, but it did not become fully effectiveuntil the National Land Fund was created in 19^-   Since then it has been used in conjunction with the Fund to provide a means whereby nationalheritage property ha6 been acquired for the public benefit.   Some four-fifths of expenditure from the National Land Fund now goes to pay the inland&apos;Revenue the amount of tax which has been satisfied by the acceptanceof property in lieu.   The acceptance in lieu procedure incorporates taxbenefits for owners and a &quot;douceur&quot; arrangement to encourage them to dispose of their property to public institutions.   However identical tax and douceurarrangements apply in the case of private treaty sales to national and localmuseums and galleries, the National Trusts and other institutions concernedwith the preservation of our heritage, so the individual owner is left in thesame financial position whether property is accepted in lieu of tax, or isthe subject of a private treaty sale.*CONFIDENTIAL
While the acceptance in lieu procedure has in the past played a usefulrole in helping to preserve the national heritage, the system has a numberof disadvantages.   The procedures for accepting property in lieu are complex,liable to misunderstanding, and sometimes time consuming.   The system isinflexible because it can only be used on those occasions where the individualowner has a tax bill which equals or exceeds the value of the property he wishes to sell.   In the Government&apos;s view an attempt to fit acceptance in lieu procedures into the arrangements for the new Heritage Fund would increasethe extent to which they duplicate private treaty sale arrangements, and wouldnot cure the existing defects.For these reasons the Government have concluded that it would be more satisfactory for the acceptance in lieu provisions to be replaced by an expanded system of private treaty sale.   Under this system any institutionwishing to acquire property by private sale will be able to apply to theNational Heritage Fund for assistance in meeting the purchase price. Wherea tax debt is involved moneys which would have formerly have been paid tothe Inland Revenue from the National Land Fund in settlement of the debtwill now be paid direct to the acquiring body from the National HeritageFund, and the individual owner will be able to meet his tax bill from thesale proceeds.   Thus in these circumstances the provision that would havebeen made from the National Land Fund will continue to go to the benefitof our heritage.   But a significant feature of the new scheme will be thatthe National Heritage Fund, unlike the National Land Fund, will be availablewhether or not the sale was occasioned by a tax debt..This system will be simpler than the procedure for acceptance in lieuand should represent a considerable improvement.   The individual vendor willnot be worse off financially than he would have been under the acceptance in lieu procedure, in that the existing douceur arrangements will be maintained,and arrangaments will be introduced to ensure that prospective vendors are put in touch with bodies which might be interested in acquiring the heritageproperty on offer by private sale.   So far as purchasing bodies are concerned,the Government intend to make special arrangements to ensure that in caseswhere the acceptance in lieu provision would have applied, the acquiring bodywill not have to contribute more; to the acquisition than at present. Thiswill in particular safeguard the position of those bodies - for instance other6.CONFIDENTIAL
museums and galleries - which would have been appropriate recipients of theproperty accepted in lieu, but which have limited or no acquisition funds of their own and would not be able to provide a substantial contribution tothe purchase price.The arrangements which now provide for the exemption of national heritageproperty from capital transfer tax are unaffected by the proposed changes.Transitional arrangements the Government intend to introduce the new arrangements as quickly as possible, and do not, therefore, consider that any major changes topresent arrangements are needed for the interim.   It will, however, benecessary after the establishment of the new Fund, to provide for cases which are already under consideration at the date of the new Fund&apos;s creation.It is therefore the Government&apos;s intention to keep the National Land Fund inexistence to run in parallel with the National Heritage Fund until outstandingcases have been completed.   Thereafter the National Land Fund will be wound up.Other ChangesFollowing their study of the Committee&apos;s recommendations, the government propose to make certain further changes.   The proposals for the NationalHeritage Fund will allow the Trustees to assist opportunity purchases of the countryside (Recommendation 1).     Arrangements are being made where practicable for property acquired in the past through the National Land Fund to be solabelled;    it will be for the Trustees of the new Fund to ensure that properacknowledgements are made for their assistance in connection with futureacquisitions (Recommendation 5)-   The Government are reviewing the conditions set out in form 700A issued by the Inland Revenue in connection with applicationsfor the exemption of works of art for capital transfer tax purposes, in con-junction with a revision of the Memorandum &quot;Capital Taxation and the NationalHeritage&quot;.   (Recommendations 11 and 12)   The figure of 25 per cent in connectionwith reimbursement by national collection to the National Land Fund is to bereduced to 15 per cent as an interim measuret   pending the introduction of thenew arrangements set out in this White Paper (Recommendation 1?)*   With the.
lapse of acceptance in lieu arrangements, it will under the new proposalsbe for the body acquiring the asset to consider whether the work of artshould remain on loan in the location with which it is associated; inthis context the possibility of extending the present arrangements whereby the Government give indemnities for loans is under consideration (recommendation the Government have also decided to make two more changes. First,the Treasury Solicitor at present owns a large part of the contents of anumber of houses owned by the National Trusts.   This situation has arisenfrom a now discontinued arrangement whereby the contents of 6uch housesover a certain value (originally  1,000, later  5iOOO), when they were accepted in lieu of tax, were loaned, rather than given, to the NationalTrusts.   Some of these works of art are of quite exceptional importance,and further thought is being given to their future, but the Governmenthave decided that the remainder (about four-fifths by number) should nowbe given to the National Trusts.   Second, works of art and other goodsmore than 100 years old are subject to export licence control;    in thecase of photographs and manuscripts the age limit is 70 years. TheReviewing Committee on the Export of Work6 of Art has recommended thescope of the control should be widened by the reduction in both theseage limits.   The Government has accepted this recommendation.   For works of art and manuscripts the age limit will be reduced to 50 year6. Theposition in regard to photographs is still under consideration. these changes will be implemented as soon as possible.Conclusion*   In the age we live in we must look both to our past and to our future.This country is exceptionally rich in its inheritance of countryside, historicbuildings, and outstanding works of art.   The Government are determined tomaintain and develop thi.6 for the benefit both of our own people, and ofvisitors from overseas.   The new National Heritage Fund, and the other proposals set out in this White Paper, will contribute effectively to thisend.18).8.
