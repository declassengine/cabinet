JMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;s government cp(78) 11324 October 1978CABINETTHE QUEEN&apos;S SPEECH ON THE OPENINGOF parliament note by the Lord President of the council. I attach a copy of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of parliament as agreed by the Cabinet on 17 October (CM(78) 35th Conclusions, Minute 2)and in the form in which it has now been approved by The Queen,2. The Cabinet agreed that there would be an opportunity to considerthe Speech again in the light of the meeting with the Labour Party&apos;s national executive Committee (NEC) on 23 October, and to make linal amendmentsif necessary.    A considerable number of the NECs suggestions had ofcourse been anticipated already.    But in view of that discussion, I proposethese additions:  that the words &quot;and using the benefits of North Sea oil to sustain the prospects of long-term recovery&quot; should be added after &quot;...economy now established&quot; in the seventh line of the third paragraph onPage 2;  and that the first paragraph on page 5 should begin &quot;fresh supportwill be given to enable the National Health Service to fulfil and extend itsservices to the public.    Bills As consequential amendments, the reference to legal aid would be moved to the end of that paragraph (&quot;A bill will be introduced to improve ...&quot;) and &quot;and&quot; would be inserted before&apos; to provide&apos; in the third line.3. In addition, the Secretary of State for Scotland has asked for the reference to legislation to establish new negotiating machinery for teachers in Scotland to be omitted.    In view of the difficulties involved in securingsupport for that legislation I propose that this should be done, deleting thewords &apos; new machinery ... to introduce&quot; in the third paragraph on page 5.The references to student awards (page 4) and social security provisions(page 5), at present in square brackets, will need to be confirmed ordeleted in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s resumed discussion of public expenditure.4* It is important for any further amendments at this stage to be kept to the minimum.   The timetable for printing and distributing the Speech^ill not allow for any amendments which are not finally agreed at CabinetQn 26 October.M FpriVy Council Office24 October 1978
