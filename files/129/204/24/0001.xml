UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT80CP(78)124 COPY NO29 November 1978CABINETEUROPEAN MONETARY SYSTEM:  FRENCH, ITALIAN and irish VIEWSMemorandum by the Prime Minister1. It may be helpful to my colleagues to have, before the discussion ofthe European Monetary System (EMS) in Cabinet on 30 November, myimpressions of the attitudes towards the EMS of three of our european economic Community partners, derived from my talks with the PrimeMinister of Italy, the President of France and the Taoiseach during the past week.THE ITALIAN APPROACH2. Signor Andreotti made it clear that so far as he was concerned thepolitical arguments in favour of taking Italy in the EMS were likely to beoverriding.     He pointed out that a positive approach to the development ofEurope and of European unity provided the only common ground between allthe Italian political parties, including the Communists.     The EMS was generally regarded in Italy as an important step towards the kind of europe which Italians hoped to see.3. Despite this favourable political approach, the Italians have hadsignificant reservationr. about the scheme.     Their doubts about their ability to remain within the proposed margin for exchange rate fluctuation (2. 5 percent) have now been met by the offer of an optional 6 per cent margin. on credit, they are now satisfied with the restoration of the level of 25 billionECUs available to debtors, as originally proposed at B reinen.     They alsoprofess to be happy with the formula accepted by the majority in the FinanceCouncil on 20 November on intervention, namely that intervention would bethe norm for divergent currencies save in &quot;exceptional&quot; circumstances.The outstanding Italian concern relates to the need for greater progress onthe concurrent studies so that the EMS will harmonise with the Pandolfi Plan:Signor Andreotti is keen to team up with the United Kingdom and Ireland tosecure concessions on this front on the European Council.1
4. To sum up, Signor Andreotti is clearly keen to take Italy into the EMS,primarily on political grounds, provided that he can obtain some satisfactionin Brussels on resource transfers and the Common Agricultural Policy.His Finance Minister and the Governor of the Bank of Italy still havereservations on technical grounds.THE FRENCH APPROACH5. President Giscard has nailed his colours to the mast on EMS and could hardly turn back now even if he wished to.     Both on political and oneconomic grounds, I believe he is still convinced that the scheme is in theinterests of France and he is determined - although perhaps not quite soconfidently as a few months ago - that the EMS should enter into force on1 January.     I believe that the President nevertheless has some worries aboutthe impact on the franc.    I/fy strong impression is that President Giscardwants an agreement which does not look simply like the Snake writ large.He will therefore prefer a Community scheme, in the management of whichthe United Kingdom would take part, even if some members, including theUnited Kingdom, were to abstain from participation in the exchange ratescheme.THE IRISH APPROACH6. Mr Lynch made it clear to me that Ireland would in principle like toenter the EMS in order to benefit from the greater monetary and tradingstability which he believes it will bring.    He is, however, firmly of the viewthat Ireland will have to secure grants - not loans - of around  650 million over a five-year period (and more if we do not participate) to enable her tocushion the initial effects of entry.     He evidently believes that membership of the EMS will help him in the struggle against inflation and that it will also have a positive effect on investment.     Unlike us, Mr Lynch claims to seesome progress in the concurrent studies on resource transfers although hewas not specific.     Even if he is not aware in detail of the technicalconsequences if the link between the British and Irish pound were broken, he knows that they will be complicated and serious:   but he is clearly preparedto live with them if he could enter the scheme with a big enough cash hand-out.L J C10 Downing Street28 November 19782
