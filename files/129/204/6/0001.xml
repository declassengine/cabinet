DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 106 COPY NO19 October 1978CABINET80THE FORWARD LOOKMemorandum by the Prime Minister1. The Cabinet agreed to resume their discussion (CM(78) 31stConclusions, Minute 4) on the themes to be adopted to portray and inform theGovernment&apos;s objectives and policies through the coming Session and howtheir presentation might be better co-ordinated.    The Lord President of theCouncil and I subsequently agreed that the discussion would best be resumedon the basis of a paper which I would circulate, reflecting points made both inthe Cabinet1 s earlier discussion and by the group of Ministers which the lord president of the Council chaired following it, and the themes I outlined duringrny speech to the Labour Party Conference.THEMES2. We are all agreed that we must look forward;  that our appeal is to the heart as well as to the head;  that our message should engage the idealism ofthe new generation;  and that it should be directed from a bedrock ofrelevance and commonsense to solving the problems of the eighties.3. Our broad themes should clearly and imaginatively portray the kind of society to which we are politically committed.    We must express them inwords which are simple and readily understood.    They should provide ouranswers to the areas of current concern that our people feel are not dealt with,as well as offering new themes which may make articulate people s needs.Such themes would provide the framework to which our objectives, policies andactions in the coming Session and our reoord of achievement can be relatedand more clearly and confidently presented.    Taken together they shouldreaffirm and update the traditional values of the Labour movement,demonstrate that only bold interventionist policies of the kind we have adoptedcan provide for a stronger economy and a fairer and more just society, and seek to strengthen the sense of public participation and responsibility inharmony with our declared policies.1
4. With this as background, I suggest that we should adopt the following main themes.a. INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT5. We must be seen to be committed to the maintenance of the essentialcontrol of inflation and determined to overcome the menace and waste ofunemployment.    These are twin and inseparable objectives and we must main-tain our resolve to search for better understanding and agreement with thetrade unions about their role in the economy, including areas such as pay;their attitude to profitability and investment and to individual rewards andpublic expenditure.     Central to this must be our commitment to the generation of the fullest use of all the nation&apos;s resources - public and private, human andmaterial - for improved living standards for all the people and the need toensure that our goods and services are cost-competitive.     We need not shyaway from a stark portrayal of the constraints about us;   our task ie to find away to break through them.    We can point to full and active involvement, asa strongly held tenet of political belief, through economic and industrialpolicies to create jobs and a manufacturing base, regenerate industry indecay, stimulate and encourage initiative and innovation, develop skills andmobility, restore full employment and protect individuals and communitiesfrom the full brunt of the coming industrial and technological change in theeighties.     Within this same theme our policies for prices, monopolies,restrictive practices and consumer protection all have a place.b. A MORE DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY IN WHICH THE CITIZENPARTICIPATES MORE DIRECTLY6. We should proclaim our commitment to a society in which individualsare much more directly involved in all those matters - whether concerningmatters of government, their working or their family lives - which most closely concern them;  a society in which the individual citizen is betterinformed, better able to represent his views and so better able to participate in establishing that necessary basis of consent and understanding whichincreasingly underlies the acceptance of authority.     This is a very broad area,and it is linked with the quality, as well as the acceptability, of decisions at every level.     Within it falls devolution and our proposals for the participation of employees in corporate strategy decisions, for school government and for atenants&apos; charter.    We are also committed to make the management of theNational Health Se rvice (NHS) more responsive.     But we should not limit thetheme to what can be achieved by legislation or by institutional change. Weshould make clear that we are ready to seek to stimulate and encourage widerparticipation wherever possible as a matter of political belief and to look tothe benefits it can provide.
c. A MORE CARING AND CONSIDERATE SOCIETY7. We must strongly reiterate our commitment to eradicate the evils ofpoverty, deprivation, discrimination, injustice and all manifestations ofbigotry and to a society which recognises that the disadvantaged and lessfortunate have a priority call upon its concern and available resources and inwhich equality of opportunity and treatment is of right.    This is at the heart of our traditional values, and there is much we have achieved to which we canpoint.    Equally, we must respond to public concern about the increase incrime, violence and vandalism and must enhance public confidence in the ability of our society to uphold the rule of law and enlist public support in measures to contain crime and in restoring pride in the welfare andappearance of the local neighbourhood.    Nor can we condone industrial action the effects of which are seriously to discomfort, or worse, uninvolvedmembers of the public.     We should seek to harness the energies and the potential for voluntary effort in communities to help underpin governmentalprovision and fill the inevitable gaps.d. A SOCIETY CONCERNED ABOUT QUALITY AS WELL AS EQUALITY8. We have greatly improved social provision overall and this isgenerally recognised, but the sheer ec&amp;le of resources employed often make sit appear at source alien or indifferent, often incomprehensible in operation and inefficient.    National and local governmental agencies and the greatpublic utilities need to become more responsive to individual needs andconcerns and more sensitive, caring, prompt and cost-effective inperformance.    This need is evident, for example, in the NHS, in the cashbenefit system, in education and in housing management in the public sector.We must therefore be seen to be committed to improvements in the quality of services without necessarily increasing the resources employed and to givethe inevitable bureaucracies a more human face.    This is an area wherenew ideas should be considered.e. summary. I have not said anything about our attitude and policies towards therest of the world - the Community, the Commonwealth, developing countries,etc.    But it must follow that the values we apply at home apply also in our attitude to them - although with different emphasis.    In short, we should seekas far as we can to relate our political actions and policies to the commonthemes we shall agree on.    The Cabinet may want to amend, to supplement,to make more concrete these ideas.    I suggest we have a discussion for thatpurpose.CO-ORDINATION OF PRESENTATION10. In our earlier discussion we touched on the need to consider thepossibility of better interchange between Ministers of information on theGovernments actions and achievements to provide the basis for a co-ordinatedpublic attitude.
11. The establiciiment of key themes to portray our objectives and policies will itself help.    As appropriate, specific actions and achievementscould then be placed in their wider context.    And it is essential in the monthsahead that all Ministers should devote a good deal of their time to putting theirthemes across and that they should be readier to look ahead beyond the boundaries of their own Departmental responsibilities in making speechesabout the future and in giving publicity in other ways to what we have achieved.We must more and more demonstrate the breadth of our commitment and itsunderlying political intent in portraying and explaining our objectives as aGovernment and the progress we have made, and are making, towards their full attainment.    I invite all members of the Cabinet to have this very much inmind and ask them to enlist their junior Ministers in the same cause.12. ,rTfce Government Record1&apos; provides a useful compendium of facts and figures of our achievements and this will be updated.    There are also arrange-ments whereby all Ministers can be informed on the Government informationnetwork of new developments.    But, to add to this, Ministers shouldPersonally exercise a political judgment in advising us all of developmentswithin their fields to which greater publicity should be given and on the ways in which these might best be presented.In the discussions in the group of Ministers which the Lord PresidentQ* the Council chaired, a number of valuable suggestions were made about howinformation needs might best be met and publicity better co-ordinated and theLord President of the Conncil is considering these and other ideas further with ministers&apos; Political Advisers and will be putting proposals to us.L J C10 Downing Street19 October 19784
