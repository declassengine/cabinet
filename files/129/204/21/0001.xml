(confide confidential )THE EUROPEAN MONETARY SYSTEMThis Green Paper should be read with the Memorandum on the proposed u^european Monetary System laid before the House by the Chancellor of^e Exchequer on 1 November 1978.      It relates the proposal to thelr*ternational monetary environment, describes the kind of system which^e Government would like to see developed so that it could includeari(* retain all the members of the European Community and discussesbriefly some of the main issues raised,He INTERNATIONAL MONETARY ENVIRONMENTFor about a quarter of a century after the 1939-^5 war, the free*0*ld lived with a system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates which*ested on international agreements reached at Bretton Woods in the^nHed States in 1944.     Britain played a major part in the working out^ establishment of this system.     The International Monetary Funds^t up at Bretton Woods to support and monitor it.    The foundationn V/hich it was built was the overv/helming economic importance of the^ted States in the post-war world.     The United States was ready toCePt responsibility for the main reserve currency of the system, toSsist generously the reconstruction of other countries of the free&apos;ra&apos;l banks of other countries to rebuild their reserves of dollars.3.Between 1971 and 1973 the system of fixed but adjustable exchangees came to an end.     One important reason was that inflation grew^ (e.g. through the Marshall Plan) and to make it possible for thefferences between inflation rates in important industrialntries increased.     Another reason was the rapid growth of other0rnies of the free world, especially Germany and Japan;   with the that the United States, though still the largest economy, nooccupied the same dominant position.(confidential)
(confidential)*&apos;   Sincd 1973 the free world has lived with a system of floating^ange rates, though the floating rates have often been &quot;managed&quot; to aboater or lesser extent.   It can be argued that the flexibility ofbating rates helped the world to surmount the unprecedented shock ofthe oil price increase in 1973-74-   The repercussions of that shock tothe world economy are still with us.   It has helped to produce, directlyindirectly, huge imbalances of payments surpluses and deficits^ween the major economies of the free world, which still persist,^se imbalances have fed currency instability and still prevent the*0rld from returning to a system of fixed exchange rates.5l Nevertheless, there has been growing disillusion with the operation0t boating rates.   Their contribution to eliminating payments imbalances.tho*6h often important, has been slower, smaller and less certain and hasachieved at a higher cost in inflation, than was hoped. Currencyh0\.in&apos;ement3 have sometimes been greater than was justified by the under-economic situation, as with sterling in 1976 and the dollar inrecent periods.   It may be that no system could have performed wellthee face of the economic imbalances of the years since 1973-   At alltsi there has developed in recent months a strong desire to move bad:greater exchange rate stability.   This has been reflected in thecies and statements of governments in situations as different as,Sample, those of the United States, Japan, Germany, France, theec* Kingdom and other countries of Western Europe.^^ATIONS FOR GREATER EXCHANGE RATE STABILITYS&apos; It*c was against this background that, in preparing for the BonnOtl0l&amp;ic Summit in July, the Prime Minister put forward a five point planwiping the free world out of economic recession by achieving a^ rate of non-inflationary growth and reducing unemployment.   This -2(confidential)
(confidential)Wan v/as adopted by the Head:; of State and Governments as the frame work0r their discussions and decisions.   Two complementary elements in it*e the need for greater exchange rate stability, which helps to foster^0vth and reduce unemployment, and concerted action to achieve greater in the economic performance of the major industrialised countries, as a foundation for stable relationships between exchange*atesConsistently with the five point plan, the European Community hasthis ,year pursued a strategy for concerted action to increase growth ande(*Uce inflation.   Member governments are now taking the measures this8t*ate,Gy requires.    If the Community pursued this type of concertedion^on continuously, that would provide the right foundation for a new0Pean Monetary System.A e Government therefore welcomed the concept of a zone of monetaryility in Europe put forward at Bremen by the Federal Germancfcllor and the President of the French Republic, to be achieved byWishing a European Monetary System.   This system, as outlined in^^iiex to the Communique issued at Bremen, was to have several^03?t&amp;nt components.   There was to be regime of fixed but adjustable^ge rates &quot;at least as strict as the snake&quot; and it was stated that^sting snake, including five members of the Community plus Norway,in question.   There were also to be a new European monetarycalled the ECU;    this new unit was to be substituted for 20% ofAQg reserve assets;    exchange rate intervention was in principle to tavplace in Community rather than non-Community currencies;    a new^ity credit system was to be based on the ECU, and was to be on aj-arger scale than the oresent Community credits;    and a EuropeanFund was to become responsible for settlormts betv/een Community&apos; *1 banks, for the creation of ECUs and for operating substitution(confidential)
The Bremen Communique also recognised the importance of economicCosvergenco as a necessary &quot;basis for greater monetary stability. Itasl:ed for studies of the measures needed to strengthen the economies0^ the less prosperous member countries, to be carried out at the sametime as the preparatory work on the exchange rate and credit aspectsof the system.   Heads of Government concluded that &quot;such measures v/ill^e essential if the zone of monetary stability is to succeed&quot;. TheySa3-u that &quot;Decisions can then be taken and commitments made at the^european Council meeting on 4 and 5 December.GOVEEuTOENT*S APPROACH^&apos;   The Government made it clear from the outset that it would^anticipate fully and constructively in the work necessary to achieve* European Monetary System which could embrace and retain all members0:f &quot;the Community and which would in fact contribute to the objectiveOfgreater monetary stability.   They stated repeatedly, before and^ter the Bremen meeting, that a new system would not be durable and active unless it were soundly based in appropriate economicNicies.   No currency intervention, however large the resources^Se3 for it, and no country, however powerful, can in the long run^3 an exchange rate if the fundamentals are wrong.   They insistedthe system should embody certain characteristics:-i. &apos;   It should be truly European and should be capable ofcontaining all members of the Community, allowing for thedivergences in their economic situation and for the time thatis bound to be needed to achieve major progress towardsconvergence;ii. It should be durable and effective.   If it proved not to bedurable, the stability of European currencies would ba-damagedWith consequent damage to the political and economic developmentof the Community as well;4(confidential)
(confidential)^-ii.    It should provide a basis for improved economic growth and higher employment in the Community, rather than impose furtherconstraints on growth and employment;iv.   For this reason, the system should impose obligations on itsstronger members symmetrical with those falling on its weakermembers;v.   The system should be supported by adequate funds forintervention on the currency markets, and adequate credit facilities should be available to finance intervention;vi*   There should be provision for realignments of exchange rateswithin the system when underlying economic circumstances made&quot;this advisable;vii.   The system should reinforce efforts to improve currencystability world-wide and should not be detrimental to other currencies, including the dollar, or to the standing and effectiveness of the IMF;v*ii. Tlie system should be accompanied by clear progress towardstaking the operation of Community policies as a whole toassist in promoting convergence of economic performance of member states.    In particular there should be the right scaleQf net transfers of resources to the weaker members rather thanthe reverse.AND EFFECTIVENESSThe Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s memorandum to Parliamentlnes the history of the existing &quot;snake&quot; arrangement.   The snake,: continuing to function for Germany and for the Benelux countries,and Norway which have particularly strong monetary and trading* with Germany, has not proved an effective basis for a truly(confidential)
. (confidential)European zone of monetary stability.   The UK, France, Italy and Swedenhave all been obliged to withdraw from it - France on  wo occasions -Usually with heavy losses of reserves or the need to accept exchange rate depreciation.12.   It has been open to any member of the Community to join the snakeat any time.   However it is not clear that the snake  is more likely attfcis moment to form an effective basis for general European exchange rate stability than in the past.   The Government has no wish whateverto interfere with the right of any country now in the snake to retainarrangements which suit them.   It is entirely willing to see aloader EMS developed which would fully accommodate and respect this*igut.   But in the light of experience and of the world economic and^change rate situations as they now stand, it has felt that it would^ a mistake to base the new EMS on an extension of the snake, orSoi&amp;ething very like it, to the larger countries which have already .found it incompatible with their needs.   Inflation differentials^tween Community countries are much greater than when the snake wasBet up in 1972.   There are still important differences in balance ofPayments performance - in particular the continuing German surplus.Co*munity currencies are differentially affected by sharp changes inthe strength of important currencies outside the Community, especially the dollar, the Swiss franc and the yen.   The EMS would have to be8t*ong enough and flexible enough to survive both the internal andVernal strains which this situation implies.   Accordingly theOovernment have urged throughout the EMS as a whole, and its exchange**te regime in particular, should be substantially different in character from the snake.   The characteristics of the EMS envisagedBremen and described in paragraph 8 encouraged the Government tove that this was something which could be achieved in the^negotiations. 6(CONFIDENTIAL)
(c5m\:^ [Hal)AN ALL-COMMUNITY APPROACH*3.    The Government believe that their approach is not only in theDest interests   of the future of the European Community, but alsoreflects what should be the true spirit of Community action. as stated in paragraph 10, the first requirement should be to shape theEMS so that it can accommodate all members of the Community, even if that means some loss of uniformity and some difference in theProvisions for various members.     The discipline of the system wouldthen be more effective because it would be durable.     Symmetry inthe obligations placed on the stronger and weaker members is equallylri line with the Community spirit.      If the margins established forexchange rates are placed under strain by the exceptional strengtha strong currency which is fortified by a large surplus on thebalance of payments, that should not automatically impose obligations* 0n Weaker members.     The converse is also true, but in that case a loss of reserves and other pressures will in any case oblige the deficit country to take corrective action.This approach has informed the Government&apos;s attitude to thetechnical questions described below.      Indeed the discussions which**ave taken place on these technical questions have thrown a light0n the extent to which potential members of the EMS accept thePractical implications of the fundamental truth that thedurability     of any exchange rate   regime   depends on concerted action to achieve greater compatibility in economic performance.ney have also revealed the manner and spirit in which membersai?e likely to operate the system as a whole and the exchange*ate regime within it.(confidential)
(confidential)SHE DISCUSSIONS:    PARTICULAR ASPECTS^-5.   The snake works on the basis of a &quot;parity grid&quot; of agreede*change rates between the members of the system, as explained at paragraph 14 of the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ memorandum of^ November.     In such a system, two currencies always reach theirintervention margin at the same time v/hen the gap between themrises to 2J per cent, so that it cannot be clearly establishedWnich is the currency where divergence is causing the strain,however, whichever of the two currencies is divergent, the parity&amp;*id system obliges both currencies to intervene simultaneously.le government responsible for the weaker currency then suffersMediate damage either through losing reserves or through having^0 adopt deflationary policies, or both, although it had no*esPonsibility for the situation.      On the other hand, the Governmentthe.stronger  currency adds to its reserves, and, although there^ be an effect on its domestic money supply, is not under^responding pressure to take expansionary or other action to0rrect the divergence, even when its currency is the cause of it.cause of the fundamental lack of symmetry in the obligations imposed^ the parity grid, the snake has a tendency to encourage deflationaryNicies overall.^&apos;   The Government has put forward two main proposals designed torcome this disadvantage in the snake system:(a) The exchange rate regimeThe Government suggested that instead of operating on thebasis of a &quot;parity grid&quot;, the exchange rate obligationsshould be related to movements away from the weighted(confidential)
(confidential)average of Community currency values. Each participatingcurrency would be permitted to fluctuate within the agreed-   margin on either side of its reference rate against the&quot;basket&quot; of currencies in European Currency Units which inany case   will act as the 1 numeraire1 of the system.When a particular currency reached either of its margins,there would not necessarily be another currency at its ownmargin at the opposite end.     The currency at the limit(whether strong or weak) would thus clearly be identified as the divergent currency.     Only the divergent   currency wouldbe obliged to intervene so as to bring itself within the margin.&quot;Other member states have not been prepared to accept thatthe &quot;basket&quot; arrangement should be the sole basis of theexchange rate regime.     There has, however, been general support for the compromise arrangement described at paragraph 1*J of the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ memorandum.Under this arrangement, there would be a &quot;parity grid&quot;, but within this each currency would have an agreed narrowermargin of fluctuation, a reference rate determined inrelation to the ECU.     When a currency reached its limitagainst the ECU, this would be taken as an indication thatit was a divergent currency.(b) The intervention and settlement arrangements as explained in the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;smemorandum, there is as yet no agreement on what shouldhappen when a currency (whether strong or weak) is(confidential)
identified as divergent in this way.     The Governmenthas supported the arrangement described at paragraph15(iii) of the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ memorandum.Under this arrangement, the financial authorities of thecountry whose currency is identified as divergent wouldbe obliged to intervene in the currency markets to check the divergent movement of that currency.      In additionthey would enter into immediate policy consultations with the other members of the system to determine whateconomic measures they should take to restore stabilityto the system.     The divergent country v/ould not be ableto demand early settlement of intervention debts due toit from another country whose currency was not alsodivergent, but had been used in intervention by thedivergent country.- 10 -
- (CONFIDENTIAL)&quot;-&apos;*   There is still a spectrum of views on this question in the^fiffiunity.   About hair the members favour a presumption which v/ould0blige the divergent country to take appropriate action, unlesse*ceptionally that country gave reasons for not acting.    One or twoCountries are opposed to anything more than a general presumption, and^e not prepared to say that a failure to act would be exceptional. Thev view, which has also found support, remains that there should be an0^igation to intervene (pending other remedial action) when a currency is identified as divergent.^ CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS18*   The Government has been among those arguing that credit to a*0tal of 25 billion European units of account (EUA) should be&quot;Active ly available to debtor members at the outset. (See^ao-raph 17 of the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s memorandum.)^ Relieves that this arrangement would be in accordance v/ith the^elusions of the European Council meeting at Bremen, and would be aArable underpinning of the exchange rate arrangements.&apos;   -this is now generally agreed, though there remain differencesview about how to split the total between short and medium-term*e(*it.   There are also outstanding questions on the duration of*t term credit (6 or 9 months) and the very short term credit givene*v&apos;een central bankers in day to day intervention (30 days or 60 dayse3? the end of the month in which the debt is incurred).^IGNMENT OF EXCHANGE RATES\ TIt has been agreed that, while the EMS should aim at reducing the for frequent realignments of exchange rates, there should^theless be provision for realignments by mutual agreement.    It hasbeen proposed that there should be provision for temporary^ve of absence&quot; (conge) from the system in exceptional circumstances^ essentially temporary nature.(confidential)
(CONFIDENTIAL)21. In the last resort any participating country would be able toleave the system altogether (in the same way that several countries -including the UK - have left the existing snake.)OTHER FEATURES OF A EUROPEAN MONETARY SYSTEM22. The margins and intervention arrangements which have been sointensively discussed were only part of the proposals made at Bremenfor a constructive and creative European Monetary System.   The otherfeatures are outlined in paragraph 8 above.    In particular the ECUwas to be the centre of of the new system.   However, little progress has yet been made on a credit system based on the ECU;    or on theECU as a reserve asset or as a final means of settlement. Becausethe parity grid has been preferred to a &quot;basket&quot; system in the^change rate regime, the ECU plays only a limited role there. TheEuropean Monetary Fund has yet to be designed and established.**o element of reserve pooling is yet in prospect.   These aspects of system could be valuable both for the Community and for theinternational monetary system as a whole.   But they remain to beforked out.RELATIONSHIP WITH THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY SYSTEM^3.   Similarly, the UK has seen the EMS as a step towards worldMonetary stability.   It has generally accepted that the EMS mustaot consistently with the IMF, and is not intended to change thelights and obligations of member countries in the IMF.   But the^ would like to see a positive approach to the relationship of the^ to other main currencies, including the dollar, and to the^-international monetary system as a whole.(confidential)
(confidential)CONCURRENT STUDIES AND ECONOMIC CONVERGENCE2k%   Greater convergence in the economic performance of the participants is an essential element in a durable EMS. Convergencecannot be imposed by a particular exchange rate mechanism; itroust develop from adequate co-ordination of economic policies;the concerted action programme, now being put into effect, is an example.     The Government therefore regarded as of critical importance the decision of Heads of Government at the EuropeanCouncil at Bremen to commission concurrent studies of the actiondeeded to be taken to strengthen the economies of the less prosperousMember countries in the context of the EMS.     The Heads ofGovernment stated &quot;such measures will be essential if the zoneQf monetary stability is to succeed&quot;.     They gave the Community&apos;economic Policy Committee the task of producing a report; theResults of this work were to form the basis for &quot;decisions and commitments&quot; at the European Council.25.    Our partners agree unanimously that one necessary conditionfcr the system to be effective and durable, is that inflation rates should converge at as low a level as possible, without this having a deflationary effect.     They see the convergence of inflationr*tes at a moderate level as an integral part of a wider strategyaimed at achieving sustained growth, gradually leading to fullernPloyment, a convergence of living standards, and the reductionof regional disparities.     They agree that to ensure the success0f this wider strategy and to allow all Community countries toPa-rticipate, there should be greater convergence of economicp0Hcies and that the Community&apos;s decision-making mechanisms should
be strengthened to this end.26. The Government welcome this emphasis on the importance of achieving more convergent performance since there has sometimesseemed to be an excessive concentration on exchange rate mechanismsduring the discussions on the EMS.     Such concentration is in danger of putting the cart before the horse.27. Our partners have also recognised that participation in theEMS could pose major problems for the less prosperous countries,however determined the efforts of those countries to fight inflationtoight be.     They might also face long term problems in reconcilingcontinued participation in the exchange rate regime with pursuit of their goals on growth and employment.     So they need Communityhelp to solve these problems.      The EMS must be seen to be compatible with the Community&apos;s long term objective to narrow the gap betweenthe more and less prosperous countries.The Community Budget is an essential instrument to achieve this.     Community policy taken as a whole, including resourcetransfers through the Budget, must contribute to economicconvergence.      It certainly should not hinder it.     The Governmentis concerned about the present budgetary position of the UnitedKingdom in the Community, and about the way in which its burden would increase as the transitional arrangements come to an endnext year unless corrective action were taken.     The table at appendix A indicates the underlying trend.     We are seventh out0f nine in terms of GDP per capita;    in 1980 we could become(confidential)- Ill -
(confidential)the largest net contributor to the Community Budget. Thiswould have a damaging effect on the Community as a whole as well*s on Britain.      The British Government, with the support of theIilsh and Italian Governments, have argued that the EuropeanCouncil should make a firm commitment, over a limited but fixed period of years to bring the pattern and scale of net resource itransfers attributable to Community instruments into conformityv&apos;ith the Community&apos;s objective of bringing about convergence in^e economic performance of member states.     This would constitute* broad guideline for subsequent decisions by the Council of Ministers.Although the Community Budget must play its part, nationalpt*icy measures will remain the main instruments for bringing about convergence between the economic performance of member states,^ose measures have however to be compatible between the partnerEntries and consistent with a wider strategy for improvedeconomic performance.*0I*ICY IMPLICATIONS30*   It is important to make clear first that in the Governments.e* the choice to be made in the coming weeks relates not to our support for a European Monetary System on the basis laid down in^men, but to whether we adhere to a particular exchange rate^^anism yet to be fully negotiated, if it begins to operate on or*bout 1 January 1979.     Some may regard the EMS as little more than*n exchange rate mechanism, supported by central bank swap arrangements,0 Government see it as much more than that.     They believe it was00nceived as more than that at Bremen and that it needs to be more(confidential)- Vj -
(^confidential J han that if it is to contribute to greater stability in theinternational system.31.    A discussion of all the possible implications of locking the sterling exchange rate to that for the other Community currenciesunder a particular scheme in a few weeks&apos; time involves difficultassessments and judgments as to how the scheme would operate and how producers^ consumers, wage earners, etc. would react to it.Ir* advance of agreement on the nature of the scheme only the mostgeneral statements are possible.     The following paragraphs considertne possible effects of a scheme, were we to join it, on -(i)    our economic independence;(ii)    the battle against inflation, including the controlof the money supply;(iii)   price competitiveness, the balance of payments and hence economic growth.SHg^Economic Independencec&apos;    In an open economy, heavily dependent on world trade and with^ Per cent of our GDP going in exports, we are particularlyVulnerable to economic developments overseas, whatever our exchange*a^e policy may be.     The past five years have shown how mucheconomic activity abroad determines our own activity and income,exchange rate cannot be freely manipulated to insulate us fromShetoVelopments abroad.     It has in fact become increasingly importantmaintain reasonable stability of the sterling exchange rate iner- to promote stable trading conditions and diminish business .sk.     to accept a formal commitment to exchange rate stability/0uld not therefore represent a major break with existing policy.(confidential)
(CQNFfDEJTSAt)The claim that joining the EMS v/ould involve a loss of economicindependence is only partially true.     In any case the discussions with our partners have shown that they v/ould not wish or expect usto suffer economic damage through joining the scheme.     If we founda Particular exchange rate to be untenable or unacceptable aRealignment v/ould be possible.33.   The Government see no objection of principle against entering into international agreements to maintain stability in the exchanger&amp;te with the help of co-operative credit and reserve assetarrangements:    provided they are satisfied that the timing and natureof the agreement is right.     It is wholly appropriate that we should do this within the European Community to which we belong. V/eadhered to the Bretton Woods agreement for fixed but adjustable^change rates for a quarter of a century.THE BATTLE AGAINST INFLATIONThe Government has made it clear, in action and in statement,th*t it is giving and will give top priority to fighting inflation.This will govern its policies whether the UK joins the exchange rate^ehanism of the EMS at the outset or not.     As part of that policytne Government will work for a continuation of the exchange rateAbility v/hich sterling has enjoyed for nearly two years.      In 200f the last 22 months the sterling effective exchange rate, in terms0f a basket of currencies, has remained between 61.5* and 63* o?the Smithsonian parities (1971), a band of less than 3$.      In theotner 2 months it was higher.     Like most other European currencies ,(confidential)
sterling has risen in terms of the dollar but fallen in terms ofthe mark within this overall stability.35.    Joining the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS could help ourfight against inflation if the mechanism were durable for asubstantial period and deterred rather than encouraged speculation(confide confidential )
(confidential)^6.    Membership of the scheme would also have implications forMonetary management which is an essential weapon in the Government&apos;sarmoury against inflation.    If sterling were at the interventionlimits we v/ould be required to hold the rate down by buying foreign currency with the consequential expansion of our money supply. OurMonetary targets could be jeopardised, as they were in late 1977V;hen we sought to stop the appreciation of sterling or as happenedRecently in Germany and Switzerland.    On the other hand if were;ere intervening to defend sterling we would have to sell foreign currency and this would contract the money supply.    The effectof these movements would generally be to help the battle against^flat ion when we were performing badly and to hinder it when we^ere performing well.    On the other hand, if we set a fixedQnetary target, it can be argued that we would not wish to see^t overshot or undershot because for reasons exclusive to ourselves0ther currencies were respectively strong or weak.COMPETITIVENESS AND THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS37It is a major area of economic controversy whether a higher*Verage exchange rate would cause a loss of exports through reduced^*ice competitiveness of UK goods and services, would increaselrnPort penetration, damage the balance of payments and reduce^estic output.38&apos; The first question is how far the exchange rate would in fact be u&apos;nigher within an EMS exchange rate regime than outside it. The19(confidential)
(confidential)Regime would provide for exchange rate adjustments, so there could be changes over a period inside or out.   There is no way of knowing what difference, if any, there would be and inwhich direction.    That would depend on a great many factors.The Government have every intention of pursuing the same firmcounter-inflationary policies whichever way the decision onthe exchange rate regime goes.    Circumstances could arise inwhich the exchange rate was lower within the scheme. If,hov/ever, it is assumed for the purposes of argument that theaverage exchange rate would be a little higher inside theEMS regime, we then have to consider first, the impact on costsaswell as on prices; and, second, the sensitivity of UK exports and imports to price change.^9.    A higher average exchange rate may make British goods and services dearer to foreigners, but it will also reduce the costof British business.    It should lead too to lower rates of wageir*crease without any loss to living standards.    The pressure to keep down costs implicit in the higher exchange rate may stimulateCost-saving and therefore efficiency.    By all these routes the loss0f Price competitiveness may be offset and, over a period possiblyeliminated.    Once a virtuous circle of exchange rate stability, lowerCQsts, greater stimulus to efficiency has been established, the effects0f any initial loss of price competitiveness may be removed.20(confidential)
(CONFIDE Nil At)Much depends on the speed with which the beneficial effectstoove through the system.     Similarly, the duration of any benefitto competitiveness through depreciation will depend on the speedV/ith which the resultant cost increases find their way into pricesln industries exposed to international competition.^1-    On one view a substantial part of the benefits to pricecompetitiveness of a lower exchange rate, or the costs of a higherrate5 will persist for several years, leading to a loss of output andemployment.     On another view the period of substantial priceadvantage will be only a year or so and will be bought at a relativelybigh inflationary cost.     What seems quite clear is that the benefits to competitiveness come quickly and then decline progressively, whilene benefits to counter-inflation policy come fairly slowly but thenb^ild up over a period.lip .c&apos;   The initial effect of a higher exchange rate is to increase^ceipts from exports on foreign currency and to reduce foreign currency expenditure on imports.      If, however, the effect is to*educe exports and increase imports, this initial &quot;improvement inthne terms of trade&quot; may after an interval be more than offset, so^hat the balance of payments deteriorates through loss ofCojnpetitiveness.h-K . ...J*   The trade of some countries is very much more price sensitive^ban others.     Many imports of food and raw materials may be ratherSensitive to price change.     Some exports are sold very much more21(confidential)
ICQNnuENTIALjonQuality and delivery than, within a reasonable margin, on price.A further very important consideration is that if a falling^change rate leads to an acceleration of inflation, industry begins to suffer in a great variety of ways which themselves damageCoropetitiveness - higher interest rates, a demand for increased working capital, uncertainty hindering investment and acceptance of contracts,heater risk of industrial difficulty and diversion of managementeffort etc.The conclusion from all this must be that it is extremely^difficult to put figures to the effects of a higher exchange rateth any kind of confidence.     Moreover in this instance the extent,ifany, of the higher rate would be guesswork.     Perhaps a fairdelusion would be that there have certainly been cases whereCoUntries have improved their balance of payments over a period wheretheixi exchange rate fell because it was no longer in line with the^flerlying economic realities. In recent years, however, the effectOf ,changes in nominal exchange rates seems to have been slower and*ess certain.      In some countries the volume of exports lias held up*n a striking way in spite of sharp exchange rate appreciation andwer costs have offset much of the effects of the appreciation.Government for its part has made it clear that it does note8ard exchange rate depreciation as a solution to the economicP*oblems still facing the UK.(confidential)
(COKRDENTfAL)CONCLUSION^6.   The Government hare not yet reached their own conclusion on whether it would be in the best interests of the UK to join theexchange rate regime of the EMS.     However, the Government&apos;s basicobjectives will remain unchanged whatever decision is taken. TheGovernment will vigorously pursue those policies which they are convinced are in the best interest of this country and will laythe basis for improving growth and reducing unemployment. these policies are to improve industrial performance and above all to win the battle against inflation, success in which will provide a lastinghasis for stability of the exchange rate./APPENDIX(CONFIDENTIAL)
