I attach a revised draft of The queen s Opening Speech, incorporatingthe amendments which the Cabinet agreed on 28 September (CM(78) 33rdConclusions, Minute 2), and others made as a result of subsequent discussionwith the Ministers concerned.2. A number of references are still in square brackets since they are subject to our discussions on public expenditure.    All of them, with thepossible exception of student awards, will be able to stand if the Cabinetapproves the Chief Secretary, Treasury&apos;s proposals in his memorandum cp(78) 99.    The reference to legal aid also needs policy approval from theHome and Social Affairs Committee which the Lord Chancellor is now seeking.The reference to open government and the reform of Section 2 of the official secrets Act 1911 is in the terms proposed by the Ministerial Group onDisclosure of Official Information.
