DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 12912 December 1978CA3INETREGULATIONS FOR THE CONDUCT OF european assembly ELECTIONS IN GREAT BRITAINMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome department. Paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 1 to the European Assembly ElectionsAct 1978 provides for me to make regulations regarding the conduct ofEuropean Assembly elections in Great Britain.    In August, I published a white Paper containing draft regulations (Cmnd 7323) and invited the comments of the political parties, local authority associations andreturning officers.2. I have now considered their comments.    Most of these relate to the detailed conduct of the elections and concern such matters as the period for inspection of candidates1 returns and declarations of expenses and the lastday for the receipt of postal voting applications.    I shall be writing to thoseof my colleagues most directly concerned informing them of my decisions.On four matters - candidates1 expenses, the number of signatures requiredfor nominations, the size of the deposit and the level of the threshold forsaving deposits - I thought it might be useful if I circulated my views more widely as background to our discussion of the scheme under which certaincandidates contesting the first European Assembly elections are to be reimbursed from public funds 50 per cent of their maximum permittedelection expenses or their actual expenditure, if lower.EXPENSES3. The draft regulations set the limit for candidates&apos; election expensesat a basic sum of  5, 000 plus a variable element of 2p pjr elector, giving a limit of about  15, 000 for the average Euro-constituency of 500, 000electors.    Both the Liberals and our own Party have represented that this is too high and proposed that the variable element be reduced to lp per electorto give a limit of about  10, 000.    The limits proposed in the draft regula-tions are slightly (but defensively) lower than would apply if the limits werecalculated separately for each Parliamentary constituency making up aEuro-constituency.   The lower limits are unrealistic, given the costs of printing election material and other unavoidable expenses.    I have decided,therefore, to make no change in the proposals set out in the draft regulations.COPY NO
SIGNATURES FOR NOMINATION4. The draft regulations require candidates to have the support of aproposer, a seconder and 28 assentors from the Euro-constituency concerned.The Liberal Party have argued for 500 assentors, while our Party havesuggested that 28 is too high a figure because of the danger of nominationpapers being rejected on purely technical grounds.    I have decided that inview of the size of Euro-constituencies, it is right that nomination papersshould be signed by 30 constituents and I intend to make no change in that part of the draft regulations.THE SIZE OF THE DEPOSIT5. The draft regulations propose a deposit of  600, a figure which is acceptable to our Party.    The Conservatives have argued for  900 whilethe Liberals have urged the complete abolition of the deposit.    I see noreason to depart from the view that  600 is appropriate for these elections.THRESHOLD FOR SAVING DEPOSITS6. The threshold for saving deposits proposed in the ^raft regulationsis 12^ per cent, which has long been accepted as entirely appropriate for thepuiposes of Parliamentary elections.    Some have argued that the thresholdought to be lowered to reflect the larger size of Euro-constituencies, butthere is no logical reason why the size of the constituency should determine the percentage of the vote accepted as distinguishing between &quot;serious1 and&quot;frivolous1 candidates.    There is no reason to lower the limit for thiselection;  to do so would be to unleash pressures for a similar reduction inGeneral Elections and there is no general feeling for such a change at tnisstage.7. A threshold of 12^ per cent for saving deposits is perfectly compatible with a scheme for reimbursing the election expenses of candidates who havereceived a smaller proportion of the total vote.8. I intend to lay these regulations, which are subject to affirmative resolution of both Houses, before Parliament as soon as we return in theNew Year.M RHome Office12 December 19782
