8vconfidentialdocument is the property of her britannic majestvs government cp(78) 11124 October 1978PUBLIC EXPENDITURE, 1979-80 TO 1982-83Memorandum by the Central Policy Review staff. In reaching their decisions on CP(78) 107 and CP(78) 108, ministers may wish to take into account the following considerations.LEVEL OF expenditure2. This is not at issue.    Ministers decided on 6 July (CM(78) 25thConclusions, Minute 4) that public expenditure should be ximited to the totalannounced in last January&apos;s White Paper for 1979-80 and 1980-81, and to a growth rate of 2 per cent in each of the following two years.    Nothing has happened since then to justify reopening that decision.SIZE OF CONTINGENCY RESERVE3. Ministers decided on 17 October (CM(78) 35th Conclusions, Minute 4)thatthe Contingency Reserve for 1979-80 should be  800 million. For1980-81, the Chief Secretary, Treasury has recommended a reserve of500 million. These figures are broadly in line with the comparableProvision in earlier White Papers. Anything less could lack credibilitygiven:-i.       the list of potential claims, particularly in the industrialsector;ii.       the fact that this year&apos;s reserve is virtually exhausted with months of the year to run.distribution between education and health4* Unless Ministers wish to reopen the decisions they took at the lastCabinet meeting, and if the Contingency Reserve is to be maintained broadlyat the levels referred to in paragraph 3 above, there is  57 million to distribute in 1979-80 and nothing in 1980-81.    The following are among the factors to take into account:-copy NO80CABINET
i.        The level of expenditure on education is planned to rise overthe Public Expenditure Survey period despite a declining school population.    Some improvement in the pupil/teacher ratio isimplicit in existing plans.ii.       The health programme too is rising steadily over the period,but largely in response to demographic changes (including the risingproportion of the very old).     Apart from the &quot;knock-on&quot; effect ofthe  50 million added at the time of the Budget, the programmeallows for little more than the maintenance of existing standards,particularly in the early years.iii. The health service is more obviously under strain than theeducation service.    There may well be scope for savings in theNational Health Service, particularly on administration and the drugsbill, but these are unlikely to help the situation in 1979-80.iv. The education programme has been substantially underspentin recent years.    The health programme was fully spent last year.v.        The prospect of further underspending on ed cation, by localauthorities should go far to meet unavoidable extra demands e. g. for school meals.    The main remaining case for adding to the programme in 1979-80 is to make early provision for the introduction of educational maintenance allowances for 16-18 year olds, to which theGovernment is committed in principle, though not as to timing and amount.    Such a scheme is supported by the Trades Union Congress.On the other hand:-a. in whatever form the scheme is introduced, the cost would rise rapidly in later years, and there is no provisionfor this;b. the payment of maintenance allowances is unlikely tohave a large effect on numbers staying on at school. Thebulk of the expenditure will therefore go to support children who would have stayed on anyway;c. the allowances might be unpopular.    Whether the money is to be paid directly to the children or to their parents, somewill see the scheme as a means of providing pocket money toother peoples children at rates which they could not possiblyafford to give to their own.vi.       Apart from the claims from education and health there is therequest to extend eligibility for long-term supplementary benefit.This too is open to the objection that its cost would rise in later years, and that there is no provision for this.    It would in any case be better considered in the context of the studies on the long-termunemployed.2
conclusion. On balance, the Central Policy Review Staff recommends that thefull  57 million should be added to the Health and Personal Social Servicesprogrammes.    There should, however, be no automatic entitlement to a&quot;knock-onl! increase in 1980-81.Cabinet Office23 October 19783
