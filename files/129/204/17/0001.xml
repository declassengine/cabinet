GOVERNMENT OBSERVATIONS ON THE FIFTH REPORTFROM THE EXPENDITURE COMMITTEESESSION 1977-78, HC1. The Government have studied the fifth report of the expenditure committee in the 1977-78 Session with great interest. The fishing industryoccupies an important place in our national life not only as an industry which makes a significant contribution to our national wealth and employs directly and indirecUy many thousands of our citizens, but also as a traditionalindustry that has been carried out for many hundreds of years around ourcoasts. It would therefore have been a very appropriate industry for a studyby the Trade and Industry Sub- Committee of the Expenditure Committeeeven if the current negotiations about public common fisheries policy (CFP) forthe states of the European Communities were not taking place. TheCommittee&apos;s report coming as it does after so many countries have extendedtheir limits to 200 miles but before the completion of the CFP negotiations is most opportune, and the Government welcome the opportunity to respond to the 64 conclusions and recommendations listed in the report. TheGovernment&apos;s replies to each of these recommendations are set out below.Recommendation 1: Continued effort should be made to improve the accuracy and timeliness of national and international fishery statistics.2. As the Government indicated in their observations on the Committee&apos;sthird report in the 1976/77 session, they fully appreciate the vital importanceof efficient statistical arrangements for fisheries. Improvements have beenmade in the United Kingdom^ own statistical systems and the Departmentsconcerned will continue to try to ensure that these systems operate withmaximum efficiency. The UK also participates fully in European economic community (e.c.) and other international efforts to improve fisheriesstatistics. A draft e.c. enforcement regulation includes proposals for improving the collection and reporting of landings statistics in all EECmember states; and the UK will seek to ensure that the arrangements finallyadopted are as efficient and effective as possible.Recommendation 2: Timely steps should be taken to mitigate localfactors which inhibit the recruitment of scientists to the departmentalfisheries laboratories.3. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) and theDepartment of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland (DAFS)do not considerthat the recruitment difficulties at the Marine Laboratory and the TorryResearch Station in Aberdeen (noted in paragraph 26 of the expenditure committee&apos;s report) justify special measures at present. They will, however,continue to keep a close watch on the situation, taking full account of thedesirability of taking action before damage occurs. The Government must, ofcourse, have regard to the position of other employees in their service incomparable situations and to the requirements of national pay policy.
Recommendation 3: Jlie UK should continue to take an active part inthe work of ICES and should provide an appropriate share of its costs.4. The Government fully recognise the valuable role played by theInternational Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and intend tocontinue their financial support and to play an active part in its activities. Thecurrent President of the Council of ICES is the Director of DAFS MarineLaboratory at Aberdeen and the Chairman of the Advisory Committee onFisheries Management is a member of his scientific staff.Recommendation 4: Rigorous conservation measures should continue,and be strictly enforced, for most of the principal species of fish andthe need for such measures for other species should be re-examined.5. The Government endorse the findings of the Committee on the needfor an effective and strictly enforced conservation policy. This has been reflected in the Government&apos;s insistence in the CFP negotiations on the needfor adequate and effective conservation measures within the waters of EECmember states. The Government have taken national measures in accordancewith agreed Community procedures in a number of areas; of the measurescurrently in force the most important are the North Sea and West of Scotlandherring bans and the closed area for Norway Pout fishing off North EastScotland. The Government agree with the emphasis placed by the Committeeon the need for increased mesh sizes and improved by-catch controls, andhave taken action recently to reduce from 20 to 10 per cent the maximumpermitted by-catch of protected species in small mesh, that is mainlyindustrial, fisheries. The Government announced on 3 July their intention to prohibit the use of nets of less than 70 mm mesh for fishing for nephrops inall waters within UK fishery limits.6. The Government will continue to participate in and contribute towardsinternational work concerned with fisheries conservation, and to carry out a full programme of research into the principal and other species of fish. TheGovernment^ objective is to secure where possible appropriate Community-wide conservation measures, but they have demonstrated their readiness totake national measures to protect fish stocks when necessary. In the develop-ment of conservation policy the Government will take full account of the specific recommendations made by the Committee.Recommendation 5: Ways should be studied of avoiding destruction of young flatfish by small-meshed shrimp trawls.7. Ways of avoiding the destruction of young flatfish by small-meshedshrimp trawls have been studied by the MAFF Fisheries Laboratory and onthe Continent. Fishermen are being encouraged to make use of the results ofthis research.Recommendation 6: Where quota and licensing restrictions are in force,discarding at sea of species subject to restriction should be made a breach of the licence conditions.
8. The Government appreciate the arguments which led the expenditure committee to recommend that for certain fisheries there should be a ban onthe discarding of fish at sea. There would,however,be very serious difficultiesin enforcing such a ban. Unless a fishing vessel was under close observation, itwould not be difficult for it to discard a catch at sea without risk of detection:and, even if a vessel was seen to discard fish at sea, it would be difficult todisprove an assertion that this was accidental, e.g. because of problems ofhauling nets in, or necessitated by safety considerations or involved fish not covered by the ban on discarding. Where appropriate, increases in minimummesh sizes, which the Committee generally favour, should in most fisheriesreduce discarding at sea; and regulations stipulating minimum fish sizesshould usually be more effective in encouraging fishermen to fish selectivelyand to avoid areas where immature fish are prevalent because they are lessdifficult to enforce than bans on discarding. It should also be noted that, asindicated in paragraph 17 of the Committee&apos;s report, the scientific asscss-ment of the state of fish stocks docs not depend exclusively on landingstatistics and that, while discarding at sea should, in principle, be taken intoaccount in considering, for example, statistics based on landings and tran-shipment data, the practice does not create insuperable problems for stockassessments. The Fisheries Departments&apos; Laboratories will moreover continueto mount periodic surveys of discard rates in selected fisheries.Recommendation 7: Tlie Fisheries Inspectorate should be given anyfurther powers needed to enable quantities of fish transhipped to be properly checked.9. The Government recognise the importance of being able to monitortranshipments satisfactorily. Under the mackerel licensing scheme, special arrangements have been made to monitor transhipments of mackerel andthese appear to have worked satisfactorily. The e.c. Commission^ proposalsfor monitoring catches taken within member states&apos; fishery limits take account of the need to check transhipments as well as landings; and, in thefuture development of catch control arrangements, the Government will consider whether there is a need to improve the powers of the FisheriesInspectorate as recommended by the Expenditure Committee.Recommendation 8: Research should be resumed on the developmentof a nephrops trawl which will facilitate the escape of undersized white-fish.10. So far as UK vessels are concerned the same mesh size has for sometime applied for white fish and nephrops in most areas, and the Governmenthave announced their intention to extend this to foreign vessels within UKfishery limits. Proposals are still under discussion in the eec on progressive increases in permitted mesh sizes and related measures affecting the nephrops fishery, and it is recognised that any differential inmesh sizes resulting from these discussions would create by-catch problems.
11. The Government propose to investigate this matter further. Given the limited prospect of success in the development of a selective nephrops trawl,alternative approaches to the problem might need to be considered.Recommendation 9: Tfie conservation and further exploitation ofsprats should be further studied.12. ICES is undertaking research on the assessment of sprat stocks. the uk is playing a leading part in this work. There seems to be scope for increasedexploitation of sprat stocks, but, as the committee before&apos;s report points out, somesprat stocks, including those which are not currently exploited, containjuvenile herring and in these cases exploitation needs to be limited taking account of the overriding need to conserve herring stocks.13. There has been some expansion of the human consumption market,but most of the UK catch of sprats is still reduced to fishmeal. The results ofGovernment research into the canning of sprats have been made available tothe industry, whose decisions on whether to increase processing capacity forsprats can be expected to depend primarily on commercial and marketingconsiderations.Recommendation 10: HMG should give higfi priority to R and D workon blue whiting and should support the development of catchingeffort on this fish.14. The Government welcome the Committee&apos;s endorsement of the high priority which the Government have given to research and development workon blue whiting. The Fisheries Departments and the White Fish authority have a major programme of work in hand, including exploratory voyages by government research vessels to survey the size and movements of the stock,the investigation of catching and handling problems at sea and continuingwork on the development of filleting machinery and product research. Theprogramme is expected to involve public expenditure in the order of almost 1 million in 1978/79. The Government plan to continue to finance thissubstantial research and development work in full consultation with theindustry and with continuing advice from the Fisheries Research andDevelopment Board. Increasingly, however, further progress in the commercialexploitation of the fishery seems to depend primarily on the ability of theindustry to produce a coordinated approach to the catching, processing and marketing of the fish.Recommendation 11: there is room for increased effort by UKfishermen to catch more sandeels and Norway pout.15. The size and distribution of the sandeel and Norway pout stocks havealready been studied by the Fisheries Departments&apos; Laboratories and the
results of this research have been made available to the industry. There isscope for increased exploitation and there is thought to be some sparecapacity in existing fishmeal factories when they are not handling otherseasonal landings such as sprats and mackerel. There would need to be liaison between the fishmeal manufacturing and fish catching industries to ensureoptimum utilisation of these species. However any increase in exploitationwould have to take account of the need to protect human consumptionspecies. In negotiations in the e.c. the Government have very much in mind the prospect that UK fishermen may be interested in these fisheries as well asthat for blue whiting.Recommendation 12: 77ie possibilities of exploiting other speciessimilar to Norway pout should be considered.16. Preliminary exploratory fishing on a limited scale was undertaken byscientists from the DAFS Marine Laboratory some years ago. This indicated that species such as gadiculus and silver smelts might be present in sufficientconcentration to merit research into the possibilities of commercial exploita-tion for fishmeal reduction. The Government will consider undertakingfurther exploratory fishing and research if a significant interest in acommercial fishery for these species seems likely to develop.Recommendation 13: Further exploratory work on deepwater speciesmay be justified.17. The Government have noted the Committee&apos;s comment and theirexisting research and development programme, drawn up in consultation withthe industry and on advice from the Fisheries Research and development board, includes work on deep water species such as grenadier, blue ling,smoothhead, rabbit fish, black scabbard fish and various species of sharks.Small fisheries for some of these species, especially blue ling, are pursued bysome European countries. No estimates of the sizes of the stocks of thesespecies, and hence of their maximum sustainable yield potential, are available,but there is no evidence to suggest that they are very large and hence capableof sustaining high annual yields. So far there have been no indications that either the catching or processing industries see any significant potential inthese deep water fish, and the Government share the caution expressed by theCommittee on the successful utilisation of such species.Recommendation 14: HMG and the industry should make an all-outeffort to explore and exploit the possibilities of far-distant waterssuch as the South Atlantic.18. Each possibility for far distant fisheries has to be considered separately -ately. As regards the South Atlantic, research is being carried out by theBritish Antarctic Survey and the Torry Research Station. The Government arealso keeping in touch with the White Fish Authority and the industry as tothe possibilities which the area might afford.
Recommendation 15: R and D effort on the artificial rearing ofturbot and sole should be supported on at least its present level untilremaining problems are solved: increasing effort on salmonid rearingshould not be allowed to impede this.19. Government research and development effort on the artificial rearingof turbot and sole is being maintained for the immediate future at recentlevels. In keeping the future level of this effort under review, in consultationwith the industry and in the light of advice from the Fisheries Research andDevelopment Board, the Government will bear in mind the expenditure committee&apos;s views.Recommendation 16: The classification in statistics of imports ofprocessed shellfish should be made more informative.20. The Government agree that it would be helpful to provide a greaterbreakdown of import statistics relating to processed shellfish. They are examining the possibilities with a view to introducing more informativeheadings in both import and export statistics.Recommendation 17: The exploitation of nephrops stocks near theSmalls rocks and the Labadie Bank should be considered.21. These stocks have been exploited by the French and other foreignfishermen for many years. It is for the British industry to consider whether itwishes to participate in this fishery. From the Governments viewpoint thereis no reason why the stocks should not be more fully exploited.Recommendation 18: 77ie need for conservation of lobster stocksshould be closely watched.22. The Fisheries Departments&apos; Laboratories have recently completed an intensive survey into the state of lobster stocks around the UK. In consideringthe results of this survey and the possible need for further conservationmeasures, the Government will have regard to the comments of theExpenditure Committee.Recommendation 19: Crab fisheries do not justify further government help beyond that already available, but current work onprocessing machinery is important and there is a case for additionaleffort to produce attractive crab meat products.23. The Government note the Committee&apos;s comments, and agree that noincreased help is justified. Work is however continuing at MAFF TorryResearch Station on the development of crab meat products in an effort to overcome problems of marketing and processing in the UK which inhibitmaximum utilisation of UK stocks.
Recommendation 20: Scientific work is needed to provide a basis forthe conservation of scallops, and watch should be kept on the stocksof queens.24. The Fisheries Departments&apos; Laboratories are currently undertaking a programme of research into scallops and queens, and the need for conser-vation measures for both species is under review.Recommendation 21: Tfie full development of the Pandalus fisheryshould be encouraged.25. The Government agree that the development of the Pandalus fisheryin the North Sea and off the west coast of Scotland should be encouraged,and the Fisheries Departments&apos; Laboratories have undertaken research intothe location and size of stocks. The results of this work, which is continuing,have been made available to the industry. A feature of the fishery is thatlandings are seasonal and are subject to considerable fluctuation, which posesproblems for the processing industry. Nevertheless, landings from the north sea have increased over the last few years.Recommendation 22: New basic studies should be undertaken of theenvironmental conditions necessary for the settlement and survival of young oysters.26. The direction of further research into the environmental conditionsnecessary for the settlement and survival of young oysters is currently being reviewed. The Committee&apos;s recommendation will be taken into account inthis review.Recommendation 23: There may be room for development of thehome market for squids and mussels.27. The Government have noted this recommendation. Market develop-ment of this sort is primarily for the industry, although MAFF TorryResearch Station have issued advisory notes on the handling and processing ofboth squid and mussels. It seems likely that in the foreseeable future any increased UK production will go mainly to the more lucrative export markets.Recommendation 24: HMG in consultation with the industry shouldspeedily determine what needs to be done to clarify the law on fishfarming and shellfish farming, and should thereafter introduce thenecessary legislation.28. Since the Committee&apos;s report was published the National Farmers&apos;Unions of England and Wales and Scotland have submitted to the FisheriesDepartments a paper entitled &quot;Fish Farming- The Need for a Revision ofGovernment Policy for the Industry&quot;. This contains proposals on a wide range of issues which are currently under urgent consideration by the various departments concerned. Most would require legislation. One issue, relating to
rating liability, comes within the scope of the Governments review of localgovernment finance. Another relates to the question whether there is a rightof private property in shellfish grown above the seabed: the Government havealready undertaken to seek to clarify the legal position on this and on someother minor points concerning fish farming when Parliamentary time allows.The views of the Government on the remaining proposals will be made knownas soon as possible.Recommendation 25: To ban the unloading of Icelandic vessels atUK ports serves no useful purpose.29. The ban has now been lifted at Fleetwood, Grimsby and Hull.Recommendation 26: The valuable help given by the WFA, TonyResearch Station and others in developing the market for blue whitingshould be continued and if necessary stepped up.30. As noted in the reply to recommendation 10, the Fisheries Depart-ments and the White Fish Authority have in hand a major programme of research and development concerning blue whiting, including the processingand marketing problems involved in the development of this fishery. in keeping this programme under review, in consultation with the industry andin the light of advice from the Fisheries Research and Development Board,the Government will take full account of the Expenditure Committee&apos;recommendation.Recommendation 27: HMG should resist the making of exceptions tothe ban on herring fishing in the North Sea and other areas unless a programme of exceptions can be internationally agreed which isscientifically acceptable and fair to all.31. Strict conservation measures will continue to be necessary for sometime if the seriously depleted herring stocks in the North Sea and elsewhereare to recover. The Governments policy in these circumstances is that any measures taken in relation to these stocks must, as the Committee suggests,be equitable and consistent with the scientific advice.Recommendation 28: Experiments should be carried out to deter-mine whether fish guts now discarded at sea can profitably be broughtashore and converted to fishmeal.32. MAFF Tony Research Station is conducting further work on the issues involved. In general there are no substantial technical constraintsrelating to the preservation and processing of fish guts. The major problem isthat retaining fish guts for conversion to fishmeal onshore is unlikely to becommercially attractive to fishermen. MAFF Torry Research Station is alsoexamining the possibilities for improving the economics of industrialprocessing at sea.
Recommendation 29: Unwanted and undersized fish which would otherwise die should be landed for conversion to fishmeal instead ofbeing discarded at sea.33. To permit the landing of undersized fish would, as the Committeerecognise, be incompatible with the present minimum landing size regulations.The latter act as an important adjunct to minimum mesh size regulations by making illegal the landing of fish below the size normally taken by nets of legal mesh. To permit the landing of undersized fish could also undermine the by-catch regulations which seek to ensure that catches of immature and otherwhite fish are kept to a minimum in small mesh fisheries. Fishermen are free to bring in for reduction to fishmeal fish not covered by minimum landingsize or by-catch regulations: such fish are discarded at sea basically becausethe fishermen concerned prefer to fill their boats with more valuable catch.The reply to recommendation 6 indicates the problems of seeking to bandiscarding of fish at sea.Recommendation 30: Fish of edible but unfamiliar species surplus toundeveloped human consumption markets should likewise be con-verted while these markets are built up.34. The Government agree that there is no objection in principle to theindustrial processing of such fish or of fish not suitable for human consump-tion. It is, however, important to ensure that fishing for industrial purposeshas regard to the conservation requirements both of the stocks directly con-cerned and of other stocks likely to be affected, for example, as a result ofthe catching of immature white fish with small mesh nets.Recommendation 31: The Industry should be encouraged to consoli-date its representative organisations as far as it finds practicable.35. The organisation of the industry&apos;s representative bodies is, of course,a matter for the industry itself. However, the Government agree that the pro-cess of consultation between Government and industry could be assisted bysome further consolidation of these bodies.Recommendation 32: The employers and the TGWU should discussa decasualisation scheme.36. The Government warmly support the recommendation that theemployers and the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union should discussa decasualisation scheme for the industry. Exploratory discussions havealready been held between representatives of the British Fishing federation and the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union, under the chairmanship ofthe Secretary of State for Employment, and it is expected that further discussions will be held shortly.
Recommendation 33: HMG should consider the case for establishing a Training Board for the fishing industry.37. Agreement in principle has already been reached by all sides of theindustry to establish a voluntary Joint Training Council, which will take responsibility for developing and co-ordinating training programmes to meetthe industry&apos;s current and future needs. A steering committee comprisingdeep sea, inshore and union representatives has been considering the practicalissues and a &quot;shadow&quot; Council is to meet in November 1978 when it isexpected that the Council itself will be formally established. It is not,therefore, thought appropriate at this stage to consider setting up a statutorytraining board for the fishing industry.Recommendation 34: There appears to be a case for establishing a degree course in fishing science at Aberdeen University.38. The Government are advised that the provision at Aberdeen ofa Fisheries Science course was considered by the University (with the encouragement-encouragement  of the University Grants Committee) in the early 1970&apos;s. Thesoundings taken then on student recruitment, employment prospects forgraduates and support from the fishing industry led to the conclusion thata first degree course would not have been viable at that time. The need forgraduates in the Scottish industry in its broadest sense including research establishments is presently met by graduates from University courses in thenatural sciences and other relevant subjects such as mathematics and engin-eering: these sources ensure the flexibility needed consistent with the broadspectrum of the industry&apos;s needs as reflected in the Governments researchprogrammes. There may however be a case for Aberdeen University toconsider a post-graduate course in fisheries science and technology. TheCommittee&apos;s views have been brought to the attention of the Universityauthorities and the University Grants Committee.Recommendation 35: With effect from 1 January 1980 it should beobligatory for anyone commencing seagoing employment in the fishing industry to have a certificate of bask proficiency in swimmingand life-saving.39. In the fishing industry&apos;s view training in swimming would be unlikely to make a significant contribution to the reduction of casualties at sea.However the industry is co-operating with the Department of Trade in introducing Survival at Sea training for all deep sea fishermen wherever possible before they first go to sea. Such training includes practical experience in the use of life-saving appliances and requires a certain amountof swimming ability although not to the standard of the certificate of basicproficiency. It will be for the Joint Training Council mentioned in the reply to recommendation 33 above to consider whether further training inswimming and life-saving is necessary.
Recommendation 36: The White Fish Authority and the HerringIndustry Board deserve continued support. Their amalgamation isdesirable but not urgent.40. The Government welcome the view expressed by the Committee onthe valuable role played by the White Fish Authority and Herring industry board in assisting the fishing industry and have noted the Committee&apos;s viewthat the amalgamation of the two bodies is desirable but not urgent. A reviewof these bodies is already in progress, and the Government have in mind thatindefinite deferment of a decision could be damaging to the morale of thestaff in both bodies and to the industry&apos;s confidence in them. FisheriesMinisters have undertaken to consult Parliament before a final decision isreached.Recommendation 37: Sea Fisheries Committees should continue inEngland and Wales. Their powers should be reviewed when thecommon fisheries policy has taken definite shape.41. The Government agree that it would be appropriate to review the role of the Sea Fisheries Committees once the reappraisal of the CFP has beencompleted and the future fisheries regime has taken definite shape.Recommendation 38: Responsibility for fish landing facilities atNorth Shields should be transferred from the Port of Tyne Authorityto one or both of the Local Authorities, and HMG should explorewith these all possible sources of finance for the new harbour forwhich plans exist.42. The demands for the provision of new fish landing facilities at NorthShields are well known. However, the criteria for authorising a new fish har-bour under the Harbours Act 1964 would be the same whether responsibilityfor the harbour was vested in the Port of Tyne Authority or the local authori-ties; and the Government take the view that a decision on the future of theexisting fish dock and on any proposals for new facilities can be consideredonly when future fishing opportunities for the UK are clearer.43. in the meantime, following the refusal of grant and Harbours Actauthorisation for a new fish dock on the grounds that its financial viabilitywas in question, the existing facilities have just been rehabilitated at a costof some  300,000 with the aid of 60 per cent Government grant. As a resultof this work the existing facilities should have a useful life of ten years.A decision on the facilities to replace them should be taken within the next four years.44. In these circumstances, the Government have concluded that it wouldbe sensible to defer a decision about the provision of a major new fish harbour at North Shields. However, the Government welcome the setting up ofa working party involving the Port of Tyne Authority, the local authoritiesand the dock users to reconsider the design of a new quay in the light of the changing circumstances of the fishing industry.
Recommendation 39: There may be a case for one harbour improve-ment scheme in the South West of England, but any proposal fora second should be carefully scrutinised.45. A major improvement scheme for Newlyn Harbour has already beenapproved in principle for the purpose of Government grant of 50 per cent of approved costs. It is hoped that work on the first part of the scheme, esti-mated to cost about  1.1 million, will commence before the end of the year.No proposals have been made to the Government for major developments atany other port, but the Government share the Committee&apos;s view that anysuch proposal would require careful examination.Recommendation 40: Small-scale port improvements to help smallcommunities heavily dependent on fishing should be viewedsympathetically.46. The Government have noted the views of the Committee. Financialassistance is available under the Fisheries Act 1955 towards the cost of con-struction, improvement and repair of a wide range of fishing facilities whichare regarded as promoting the maintenance or development of the fishing industry. There is no lower cost limit for grant purposes under this legisla-tion and the particular circumstances of each case are taken fully into con-sideration. The Government are well aware of the dependence of a number ofsmall communities upon fishing and every effort is made to provide assistance towards any eligible proposal which is put forward.Recommendation 41: British Rail should seek out energeticallyopportunities to attract profitable fish traffic.47. British Rail have taken note of the Committee&apos;s recommendation.Since it is Government policy that freight must pay its way, British Rail are under a specific inducement both to pursue all possibilities of carrying profit-able traffic and to take care not to enter into contracts which may worksubstantially to their disadvantage. The Government have every confidence that British Rail will and do seek out opportunities to capture any profitablefreight traffic.Recommendation 42: The possibility should be examined of nego-tiating bilaterally for access to Norwegian fishing grounds.48. The Government are determined to secure adequate fishingopportunities for the British industry in Norwegian waters having regard tothe extent to which Norwegian and United Kingdom interests in fisheries arecomplementary. They have made it clear that arrangements negotiated by theCommunity must take full account of the importance to the United Kingdomof fishing in Norwegian waters and the fact that most Norwegian fishing inthe waters of Community States takes place in UK waters. Bilateral contactshave been established with the Norwegians, there being a number of issues of joint concern, notably in the field of control and enforcement, where such
contacts can be valuable. Following talks at Ministerial level, the Governmenthave set in hand arrangements for improving contacts between our fishery protection agencies and those of Norway.49. The Government are, of course, keeping the Committee&apos;s recom-mendation in mind. The Report itself, however, makes clear that there wouldbe considerable difficulties in the way of separate United Kingdomnegotiations with third countries on fisheries matters. The Government are seeking to protect our interests through the existing negotiations within theCommunity in which the United Kingdom is very closely involved.Recommendation 43: HMG have been fully justified in defending UKfishing interests in the e.c. with some obduracy.50. The Government welcome the Committee&apos;s support for their defenceof UK interests during negotiations on the CFP. The Government haveconstantly stressed that the reformed CFP should recognise the economic,social and political importance of fishing to the UK; the UK&apos;s contribution tothe fish stocks upon which Community fishermen depend; and the UK&apos;position as the Community&apos;s heaviest loser of fishing opportunities in thirdcountry waters. Our fishing industry has already suffered severe disruption inrecent years because of the general move to 200 mile fishing limits: theGovernments aim is now to secure a Community fisheries policy which provides the industry with a satisfactory future.Recommendation 44: HMG should continue to seek agreement that each Member State should have exclusive fishing access to a 50-milewide zone from its own coasts. All UK action meanwhile should be governed by the principle of effective conservation.51. The Government welcome the Committee&apos;s endorsement (as recorded in paragraph 193 of the report) of their general approach to the negotiationsabout the CFP. Ministers have maintained close contact with representativesof the fishing industry throughout the period of the negotiations and are wellseized of the urgent need to dispel present uncertainties and provide a firmbasis for future planning. The Government believe that they have the full support of Parliament and the industry in standing out for a settlement which meets the UK&apos;s essential requirements. The Government have made clear that these requirements are exclusive access, achieved over a transitional period, for UK fishing vessels within 12 miles of UK base-lines; preferentialaccess in certain areas of UK fishery limits beyond the 12-mile line; quotaallocations that take proper account of the contribution to resourcesrepresented by the fish stocks within UK fishery limits and the extent towhich our fishermen have been deprived of fishing opportunities in othercountries&apos; waters; adequate conservation measures to safeguard the future ofthe fish stocks; and effective arrangements for enforcement of quotas and non-quantitative conservation measures.
52. In the absence of agreement on a Community basis, the Governmenthave adopted national measures to protect fish stocks in waters under UKsovereignty or jurisdiction. Conservation rules that were in force when the interim e.c. regulations lapsed at the end of January 1978 have been maintained on a national basis and the Government have augmented thesewith further national measures, in accordance with the procedure agreedwithin the Community (see the reply to recommendation 4). TheGovernment, in consultation with the industry, have also taken action toregulate fishing by UK fishermen of certain stocks and are keeping underreview with the industry the need for further measures. The government believe, however, that Britain&apos;s interests would be prejudiced by theadoption for this purpose of the Commission^ 1978 quota proposals for the uk which the Government and the fishing industry regard as unacceptable.Recommendation 45: Enlargement of the e.c. should not be allowedto reduce those fishing opportunities available to existing members.53. The Government have noted that, on present evidence, enlargementwould increase total catching capacity in the enlarged Community withouta corresponding increase in total fishing resources in member states&apos; waters.The Government are fully conscious of the possible fisheries problems whichmay arise from enlargement, and intend to ensure that the interests ofBritish fishermen are fully protected in the arrangements for the accession ofany new members of the Community.Recommendation 46: Catch quotas alone are ineffective and inequit-able unless supplemented by means of control of fishing effort.54. The Government consider that setting of quotas and their subdivisionbetween member states is an essential first feature of any system of catchcontrol. But they have made it clear in e.c. discussions that the effectiveenforcement of catch quotas depends on satisfactory arrangements formonitoring landings and that, where necessary, catch quotas will have to be supplemented with controls on fishing effort. The e.c. Commission havemade proposals aimed at ensuring that member states monitor satisfactorilylandings in their ports; and the Government will seek to ensure that theregulations finally adopted are as effective as possible.55. The general application of effective effort controls to all fishingthroughout the waters within e.c. member states&apos; fishery limits is unlikely tobe a practicable proposition at least in the immediate future: in particular,the numbers of vessels involved and the complexity of the fisheries concerned would pose major problems in determining which vessels should be authorisedto fish for which species, in which waters, and at what time, and in ensuring that fishing did indeed conform to the authorised pattern. However theGovernment are insisting on arrangements to control access to waters ofparticular importance to the UK: such arrangements would represent animportant element of effort control to supplement catch quotas.
Recommendation 47: An e.c. licensing system should be worked outin detail.56. The Government agree that the Commission^ proposal for an EEClicensing system for fishing vessels and their skippers needs detailed examination. It is important to be clear about the value of such a systembefore imposing it on the industry, and to be sure that the reasonable rightsof individuals and the ability of member states where appropriate to make their own national arrangements will not be prejudiced.Recommendation 48: For the time being, enforcement shouldcontinue to rely entirely on national policing within national 200 milelimits.57. The Government agree that enforcement within national fishery limitsshould continue to be the responsibility of the coastal state. The coastal state is the authority with jurisdiction in the waters concerned and is best placed to deploy the necessary fishery protection forces there. In relation to para 222of the Committee&apos;s report, it should be noted that the instructions to UKprotection vessels authorise them, in accordance with the 1958 convention on the High Seas, to maintain hot pursuit in appropriate cases into othercountries&apos; fishery zones up to the limits of their territorial seas.Recommendation 49: The possibility that technological and other changes might make it worthwhile to make fishing vessels carrytransponders should be kept under review.58. The present views of the Government on the use of transponders forfishery protection are contained in the memorandum submitted to the Tradeand Industry Sub-Committee on 14 October 1977 (T346). The government agree that technological and other developments could make the use oftransponders worthwhile in the future and that the possibility of usingtransponders for fishery protection purposes should be kept under review.59. As regards the clearer marking of fishing vessels, the UK hasmaintained pressure in the e.c. for progress. Norwegian, Faroese, Swedishand Spanish vessels fishing within the waters of e.c. member states are allnow required to carry clear identification markings. The e.c. Commission^proposals for monitoring fishing within member states&apos; limits also envisagedetailed rules for the marking and identification of e.c. member states&apos;fishing vessels.Recommendation 50: It is to be hoped that efforts to transfer from RNand DAFS officers to other law enforcement officers responsibility for ensuring the detention of offending vessels will prove successful.60. MAFF have made standby arrangements for detaining the boats ofconvicted fishery offenders at most of the ports in England and Wales into which fishing boats are brought by the Royal Navy for further investigation
so that the RN vessel concerned can leave port as soon as the legal proceedings have been completed. In Scotland the different legal processesrequire a different approach, but discussions to arrange detention of vesselswithout the involvement of DAFS Marine Officers or the RN are well advanced and, in the meantime, arrangements continue to be made for thesecure detention of offending vessels.Recommendation 51: Trial should be made of cameras which record the time and place when a photograph is taken, to facilitate the use ofair photographs as evidence in prosecutions.61. The Royal Air Force and the Fisheries Inspectorates are currentlyinvestigating the suitability of alternative types of camera for fisheriesprotection work. The cameras which have been tested include one thatrecords the time and place at which a photograph was taken. A procedure isalready in operation to enable a case to be brought to court on the basis ofevidence from the crew of a fisheries surveillance aircraft supported byphotographic evidence. So far one conviction for illegal fishing has beenobtained following the use of this procedure, but the case concerned was notcontested.Recommendation 52: When the TON class ships are withdrawn fromfishery&apos; protection duties their replacement should be able to cruise at20 knots with a maximum speed of 25 knots, and should be able tocarry a helicopter.62. The Ministry of Defence and the Civil Departments concerned are stillstudying the characteristics of a successor to the TON class ships currentlyemployed by the RN on coastal fishery protection. In the course of these studies the desirability of various characteristics is being weighed against their potential cost, bearing in mind that experience indicates that essential features of an effective fishery protection vessel are endurance, good seakeeping and a satisfactory patrol speed. Decisions have yet to be taken, butthe views of the Committee on speed and on the desirability of a successorcraft being able to carry a helicopter will be taken into account.Recommendation 53: HMG should study the Danish inshore fishingprotection device of a Land Rover carrying a radar and towing aninflatable dinghy.63. DAFS current enforcement arrangements include shore patrols usingmen and dinghies launched for short spells from protection vessels. A systemsimilar to that recommended by the Expenditure Committee was consideredby the Cameron Committee on Scottish Inshore Fisheries. In its report inDecember 1970 (Cmnd 4453) the Cameron Committee concluded that,because of the weather conditions off Scotland, the rugged nature of most ofthe coastline and the resultant road pattern, such a system could be effectively employed for only a limited range of tasks around Scotland. The
Cameron Committee, however, recommended that a small number of shore-based units might be useful, having regard to the enforcement requirementsof the new system of inshore legislation which they suggested butconsideration of which must await the outcome of the reappraisal of the CFP.64. In England and Wales the main task of protecting fisheries within thethree mile belt is carried out by the Sea Fisheries Committees. It would be for individual Sea Fisheries Committees to decide whether to adopt the Danishidea having regard to their existing resources and the character of the coast-line in their areas. The suggestion has been drawn to the Committee&apos;attention, and MAFF propose to include it on the agenda of their annualstatutory meeting with the Committees later this year.Recommendation 54: The Sub-Committee investigation of complaintsat the application of survey regulations to inshore fishing vessels hada satisfactory outcome which should serve as a lesson for the future.65. The Government take note of this conclusion. They are glad thatChapter 6, Part I of the report (Safety Regulations for Inshore fishing vessels) concludes that the Department of Trade&apos;s response and the work ofthe Fishing Industry Safety Group had been satisfactory in developing a more flexible approach to earlier problems. The Group has endorsed thatconclusion and continues to keep the working of the survey arrangements under review. In relation to paragraph 247 of the Committee&apos;s report theDepartment of Trade wish to draw attention to the facts that: (1) inshorevessels were exempted from having to carry medium frequency radio whereVHF coverage was satisfactory prior to the setting up of the Group; and(2) the reduction of 42H per cent applies only to the initial survey fee.Recommendation 55: There is a case for compensation for loss of access to fishing grounds caused by offshore oil activity in cases wherequantifiable and attributable loss can clearly be demonstrated.66. Following an approach from the British Fishing Federation and theScottish Fishermen&apos;s Federations in April, Ministers are currently examining the factors relevant to this issue and hope to be in a position to announce their conclusions shortly. In reaching their decision they are bearing in mind that sea fishing is a public right and no individual therefore has propertyrights in the fish in our waters. It follows that there is no automatic entitle-ment to compensation when fishermen are denied access to specific sea areas as a result of offshore oil activity.Recommendation 56: More instruction and training of officers of oil-rig supply ships is needed to lessen damage to fishing vessels throughcareless navigation.67. Although there are no statutory requirements at present in force forUK registered merchant ships, other than passenger ships, operating in home
trade waters, to have navigating officers with formal qualifications, theDepartment of Trade have from time to time issued guidance to industry onsuch matters as safe navigational practice etc. This guidance takes the form ofmerchant shipping notices which are widely circulated throughout theindustry and are accessible to all masters. In addition, the Department keepthe manning of UK registered ships under surveillance to ensure that they are sufficiently and efficiently manned.68. Regulations were made in 1977 requiring all UK registered seagoingmerchant ships of 80 gross tons and over to carry certificated officers. these regulations will come into force on 1 September 1981 after a transitional period which was agreed with industry. The regulations should bring about a progressive improvement in standards of navigation and seamanshipparticularly in home trade shipping. The transitional period before theregulations take effect was necessary to give the industry time to prepareitself to meet the new standards.69. Navigational problems created by offshore oil and gas related activitieshave been discussed within the framework of the Fisheries and Offshore OilConsultative Group. As a result of these discussions the Department of trade have held a number of local meetings between fishing skippers and masters of oil industry support vessels. These meetings have provided a useful exchangeof views on mutual problems and similar local meetings will be arrangedagain as the need arises.Recommendation 57: All concerned with offshore oil activity shouldbe made to realise the damage and risk to life which can be caused bycareless discarding of rubbish. Items of gear liable to be jettisoned orcome adrift should be durably marked so that the companyresponsible can be identified. International agreement should besought to enforce this.70. The problems created for fishermen by oil related debris have beendiscussed at various meetings of the Fisheries and Offshore Oil ConsultativeGroup. Offshore operators are well aware of their responsibility to ensurethat waste materials are disposed of in a proper fashion and they have been active in educating offshore personnel on the need for good housekeeping. by no means all of the debris which interferes with fishing operations is oilrelated. However, the question of durably marking items of gear used by theoffshore oil industry is being examined by the Department of Energy and this issue will be discussed further by the Fisheries and Offshore Oil ConsultativeGroup. The Oslo Convention relates to wastes loaded for the purpose ofdumping and specifically excludes any discharge incidental to or derived fromthe normal operation of ships and fixed or floating platforms. It would not be appropriate therefore for the Convention to be extended to cover operational requirements for offshore oil and gas exploration. Within the OsloCommission, however, the debris problem has been discussed because of itsclose affinity to the aims of the Convention. The Commission have also taken the view that the unnecessary Uttering of the seabed represents a severe
hazard to fishing operations. They have recommended to the contractingparties that they take steps to prevent the haphazard disposal of debris at sea.Recommendation 58: Compensation for damage caused by debris andpollution should be prompt and generous.71. Claims by fishermen for compensation for damage or loss of fishinggear caused by oil-related debris are directed to offshore operators or, if theoffending debris cannot be attributed to a particular operator, to a fund setup voluntarily by the United Kingdom Offshore Operators Association todeal with such cases. The fund, which is administered by a ManagementCommittee consisting of representatives of the British Fishing Federation andthe Scottish Fishermen&apos;s Federation, has been in operation since July 1975.72. Compensation for those that have suffered oil pollution damageattributable to offshore operations in the North Sea is available under a voluntary scheme set up by offshore operators, The Offshore PollutionLiability Agreement (OPOL) 1975. There are also international arrangementsfor the payment of compensation to persons who have suffered damage frompollution arising from the transport of bulk oil by ships.Recommendation 59: There is a case for e.c. assistance to tideherring processors over the years until herring supplies are restored toa reasonable level.73. To date the e.c. Commission have proposed compensation only forcatchers affected by conservation measures for herring. They have refrained from advancing parallel proposals for Community assistance for processorsaffected on the grounds that the diversity of member states&apos; processingindustries makes national measures more appropriate. The Government areconscious of the difficulties experienced by certain processors as a result ofthe herring conservation measures. However the diminishing availability ofsome species of fish is also causing problems in other parts of the fishprocessing industry. Most herring processors are in receipt of TemporaryEmployment Subsidy. The herring processors are seeking longer term aid andthis question is under consideration.Recommendation 60: HMG should continue to strive by any availablemeans to secure renewed access for UK fishermen to Icelandic and norwegian fishing grounds.74. The Government have taken every opportunity to impress upon theirEEC partners the importance of securing continued access for British fisher-men to their traditional distant water fishing grounds; and this remains a major UK objective under a revised CFP. As the Committee recognise in theirreport, however, the prospects for a resumption of UK fishing at Icelandremain poor. The Government firmly believe, on the other hand, that thebasis exists for a long term continuation of UK fishing in Norwegian waters and will strive to see that this is brought about.
Recommendation 61: The industry should pursue more energeticallythan hitherto the possibilities of new species and unfamiliar waters.75. The Government recognise the need for the industry to adjust incertain areas to fishing new species and unfamiliar waters. The replies toprevious recommendations indicate some of the help that the Government,primarily through the research and development programme, are giving to theindustry. The Government will continue to encourage the British fishing industry to take advantage of all possibilities for mitigating the loss of fishingopportunities in waters which have been its traditional fishing grounds.Recommendation 62: Line fishing with modem gear should be encouraged.76. Line fishing is at present generally a relatively labour intensive methodof fishing, but can be profitable. Moreover, by reducing the risk of by-catchesand the taking of undersized fish, it has conservation advantages. TheGovernment will continue to support a programme of research into methodsof line fishing currently being undertaken by the DAFS Marine Laboratory inAberdeen and the White Fish Authority. The Highlands and IslandsDevelopment Board is supporting the provision in its area of vessels speciallyadapted to engage in line fishing with the objective of making supplies of high quality fish available to the fish drying plant now established at Breasclete inthe Western Isles.Recommendation 63: Contraction of the UK fishing fleet is unavoidable-able, but it should be encouraged to take a form which will keep skillsand experience in being in readiness for future re-expansion and whichwill safeguard the existence of small local communities which dependheavily on fishing.77. The Government agree that there is a need for the UK fleet to adaptto changing circumstances, in particular those which will arise from a CFPsettlement. They recognise that an orderly adaptation is necessary taking account of the implications for stable employment (see also the reply torecommendation 32). Certain proposals for assisting the process of adaptationhave been put forward by the e.c. Commission; and one minor interim measure has been agreed by the Council. However the Governments position,with which the UK industry and unions are generally in agreement, is thatstructural measures cannot be properly finalised in advance of a CFPsettlement. The Commission^ proposals acknowledge the need to takeregional, social and economic factors into account and the Government have this need in mind. The Government are considering with the White FishAuthority and the Herring Industry Board the possible structural changes andany consequential alterations to the grant and loan arrangements. Theindustry and the trade unions will be fully consulted.
Recommendation 64: HMG should give full weight to the importanceof the fishing industry in all international negotiations which may affect the industry s interests. The Falkland Islands are a case in point.78. The Government agree with this recommendation and consider thatthis is demonstrated by their record in these matters. The welfare of the fishing industry has been one of the major considerations in formulating theGovernments position in relevant international negotiations. With respect tothe Falkland Islands, one of the major themes of the current Anglo/Argentinenegotiations relates to economic co-operation in the South West Atlantic and includes the question of the fishing potential of these waters.79. In determining their policy on fishing limits, the Government are obliged to take full account of developments in international law and inparticular developments at the United Nations Law of the Sea Conference.As the Committee indicate at paragraph 180 of their report, the generalextension of fishery limits in the North Atlantic has not so far proved to bea development of net benefit to the United Kingdom. Once it became clear,however, that there was no alternative to an extension of limits in the north atlantic and that a reduction of the United Kingdom&apos;s distant water catcheswas inevitable, the Government took early and positive action to protect british interests. They made clear their determination to secure an acceptablereappraisal of the CFP to take account of the realities of 200 mile fishinglimits; and the agreement of Member States of the Community to extend their fishing limits in concert in the North Atlantic and North Sea from1 January 1977 was in large measure the result of British initiative. As regardsthe fisheries negotiations with Iceland in 1975, the Government, on whosebehalf the then Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairsnegotiated, took full account of the best scientific evidence available to them.In view of the general trend of reduction in distant water catches and of the positions adopted by the Icelandic Government in negotiation, the suggestionthat a different negotiating approach might have secured a more gradual reduction of the British fishing effort off Iceland must at best be speculative.80. In conclusion the Government would like to thank the expenditure committee for their report on the fishing industry. The report is a valuable contribution to the public discussion and formulation of UK policy towards an industry that is facing many difficulties at the present time, and itsarguments and conclusions represent a useful source of advice to both theindustry and the Government.
