It seems to be their intention to make a report to*he House before the European Council on 4-5 December, perhaps in time fora Commons debate.    They have asked the Treasury for a memorandum on the^^S, to be available to them by 1 November.2.NoSince we are ourselves planning a Commons debate on the EMS in mid-november there may be advantage in making this memorandum available towhole House on 1 November rather than to the English Committee only.I attach for the information of colleagues the document which has beenPrepared for both purposes. It is a descriptive and historical account which^*ay still be subject to some amendment but colleagues will wish to know thatXt may become public before 2 November, and it may also be helpful as back-Sround material for our discussion on EMS on that date.D W Hreasury Chambers30 October 1978
proposed europe&apos; T monetary SYSTEMIbis Gieco rand urn explains for the benefit of the House the proposalnow under discussion within the European Economic Community (e.c.)for a new European Monetary System.    The Government will lay beforethe House in the normal way any suitable Community documents thatbecome available.Siwke2. The original version &quot;of the sna.:e cane into effect on 24April 1972.    It established a aeximum permitted margin of fluctuationbetween any two participant currencies of 2i%.   The snake arrangementat the time was conditioned by the agreement at the Smithsonian .conference of Deceaber 19?i which limited the fluctuation of anycurrency against its parity or &quot;central rate, expressed as a cross-rate against the dollar, to 4$%.    The sna::e thus fluctuated withina wider &quot;tunnel&quot; against the dollar and was for this reason known asthe &quot;snake-in-the-turmel11.   In March 197? the link with the dollarv.*as broken - the snake &quot;left the tunnel&quot;.   Since then, the snakecurrencies and the dollar have floated independently of each other.3. The original participants of the snake were Germany, Prance,Italy and the 3enelux countries.   T.ie United Kingdom, Ireland,Denmark and Norway (as prospective members of the Community) joinedin Kay 1972.   Norv:ay has remained a member of the snake ever since,,   . the Communityalthough in the event she- did not join/. Denmark left for a briefperiod in 1972 but has remained in ever since.   The United Kingdomand Ireland left in June 1972.   Italy left in February 1975-Sweden joined in 1973 but left in 1977.   France left in January. 19741subsequently rejoined in July 1975 but 1ft again in March 1976. Thepresent members of the snake are therefore Germany, the benelux countries, Denmark and Norway.4. Since withdrawing from the snake, France, Italy and theUnited Kingdom have permitted the exchange rates of their currenciesto float independently.   The Irish pound has been locked to the poundfcerling throughout.
5. Under the snake system, when any two countries exchange rates move apart by more than the permitted margin both countriesoust intervene on the exchange markets to redress the situation.In order to provide the country at the bottom with the necessarycurrency to intervene, the country at the top &quot;ill advance itunlimited very short-term credit, which has, however, to berepair! within 30 days of the end of the month, in which the intervention took place.   In April 1973 tie European MonetaryCo-operation Fund (IMGF) was set up to allow these debts to besettled on a multilateral basis. -6. In addition to this unlimited very short-term creditfacility, there are also      short      and medium-term credit facilities in the Community.    The short-term credit facilitycurrently can provide up to 4-6 billion EUA&quot;in total, which is available for three months, renewable once.   The medium-termfacility can provide up to 3-85 billion EUA in total for between two and five year-:.   The short-term f?:cility (but not the medium-term) is administered by tue EMCF.Initiative for a new European Monetary System?. The European Council meeting in Bremen on 6 ana 7 July1973 discussed a proposal for closer monetary co-operation leading to a zone of monetary stability in Europe, which was introduced by the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany and the^resident of the French Republic.    The Council concluded that thecreation ef such a zone was * highly desirable objective, and considered an outline scheme (annexed to this memorandum). TheCouncil envisaged a durable and effective scheme.    It agreed to instruct Finance Ministers to formulate the necessary guidelines*or the competent Community bodies to elaborate by 31 October 1978* The EUA is a &quot;basket&quot; unit of account made up of an amount ofeach of the Community currencies.   Its value in sterling termsis advertised daily in the financial press, and is currentlyabout  O.08.

D*SCUSSIONS OF THE PROPOSED NEW MONETARY SYSTEMl2-        The outline scheme considered at Bremen has been discussed.in the appropriate Community committees and at the July,SePteaber and October meetings of the Finance Council, when theChancellor of the Exchequer has represented the UK.13. rphese discussions nave not yet produced definitive proposalsfor a scheme.   There will be a further meeting of the FinanceCu&amp;cil on 20 November, and the subject will be on the agendathe Eme European Council on 4- and 5 December.Certain elements of the proposals likely to emerge from current discussions are clear.    Tho aim of the scheme wouldSlgnif Icantly to reduce the fluctuations between the exchangees of the currencies of participating countries.   To this end,authorities in each of the participating countries would^ervene in the exchange markets in order to maintain thej     les of their currencies within agreed margins of fluctuationto be determined).   It is likely that these margins will besured from a parity rate of each currency against each othersilcy in the system, giving rise to a grid of upper and lowerSs rates.    This is the basis on which the snake works. Inaddit-i.^   *^ion each currency will have a parity rate and agreed marginsActuations against a new monetary unit, the European CurrencykECU), which could have the same definition as the EUA.lll*ency which had diverged significantly from the weighted average- thne other community currencies (represented by the ECU) wouldofi ii&apos;^    eiy to exceed its margins of fluctuation against the ECU0l?e it reached its permitted margin witin the grid of cross-15,Three different possibilities could arise when this^happened, and there is as yet no agreement on which   of theree Will apply
(i)   the indication of divergence would serve as atrigger fQr consultations between the participants, but without any obligation onthe country of the divergent currency to take any action;(ii)   the indication of divergence would lead toconsultations, but with an obligation inprinciple on the country of the divergentcurrency to take some form of action to check the divergent trend, unless it could give reasonsfor failing to do so; and-  (iii)     the country of the divergent currency would be obliged to intervene.    Furthermore, in additionto undertaking economic policy consultations thecountry would not, for the time being, be able to demand payment of intervention debts due to itwhere the intervention was caused by its owndivergence. Upooean Monetary Fund^6.     The suggestion was put forward in the outline schemecSTsidered at Bremen that a European Monetary Fund (EMF) shouldbe established to take the place of the EMCF, and to absorb. the existing credit facilities in the Community.For legal and practical reasons it was not envisaged that this would take place until tv/o years after the start of theEMS.    If the EMF were to be established along the lines considered a&quot;t Bremen it would make available credit of about 25 billion EUA,by issuing ECUs against        deposits of national currencies. Dis-cussions have therefore b-. en proceeding on the possibility of^creasing to that figure the amount of credit available in theCommunity during the interim period before the EMF i-.0Perational.     A difference of view has arisen between theGermans and the Dutch on the one hand, who argue that the 25billion EUA should represent the sum of what each country could be required to advance, and the rest of the Community0I* the other, who argue that the 25 billion EUA shouldrepresent the maximum effectively available to debtors.(The difference arises because any country which v/as a debtor in
the system could not at the same time be a credi; . TheMaximum effectively available under the German scj e couldamount to only 16 billion EUA.    The maximum effect elyavailable under existing credit facilities is abou&quot; 3.5 billion18.     It is likely that settlement of debts incur: , i as aresult of intervention will be carried out in ECUs.    Each centralDank v/ould obtain its initial supply of ECUs in return for the deposit with the EMOF or EMF of 20% of its reserve.:..    This v/ouldamount to about 25 billion EUA, but would not represent any additional resources for the members of the E11S secret;*ce the ECUsWould have the same value as the reserves deposited. ThellnPlications of these arrangements for settlement have yet to be fully explored. revision for Changing Exchange Rates^9.     It is likely to be proposed that the system, whilst aimed at reducing the necessity for frequent changes in exchange rates,should nevertheless provide for arrangements for adjusting exchange rates by mutual agreement.    It may also be propose j. that, incertain exceptional circumstances of an essential] - temporarynature, a country could take temporary &quot;leave of absence&quot; fromthe system:   but some countries are not persuaded it the needfor formal provision for this, and think that sue:: provisionmight harm the credibility of the system.^sociation of non-e.c. countries the outline scheme&apos; considered at Bremen stated that non-member countries with particularly strong economi:. and financialties with the Community might become associate members of thesystem.*IHETABLE^*     It has been suggested that if the European Council meeting0n 4- and 5 December concluded that the proposed new EuropeanMonetary System should be adopted, the necessary arrangements should be made to permit the system to start operation on1 January 1979.

ANNEXS?RACT f^0M THE CONCLUSIONS OF&quot;^^^UgOPSAN COUNCIL IN BREMENTHE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SITUATION-      The European Council states that in the face of the dangers resultingeri^   the serious disruptions of the world economy, especially since theit   0f* L973-, the Community has come through a very testing time, proved0f  j?0keeioh and thereby made a decisive contribution to the stabilizationthe world economy.Con   ^0wev-r, the situation within the Community is not yet satisfactory,in *e(*Uently, the European Council, meeting in Copenhagen in April 1973,j.    ructed that a common strategy be evolved to overcome the unsatisfactorysncy of economic and social developments in the Community.actual.. ^he Community and the member states will closely coordinate theirsiric0n W*&quot;tl1 the ot^er i&amp;aJor industrial countries which are their partners,e **he problems involved will be overcome better by means of closebe     . national  cooperation extending beyond Europe, in which heed must also8ta?a^ to the developing countries&apos; interests.    The meeting of heads of16   6 anc* of government of the seven major industrial nations in Bonn on^es^ ^ 1978, at which the community is to be represented by thea   Sl(^ent of the Council and the President cf the Commission, will providec0n ^ opportunity for this.    The European Council has arrived at the.conclusions set out below regarding the action to be taken by the Communityln the member states. gonomic Policyac^. ^e European Council has decided on a common approach in order toXe X^Ve a considerably higher rate of economic growth and thus reduce thegr      of unemployment in Europe by fighting inflation, establishing h a c ^. e^ measure of monetary stability, expanding international trade,ev^nS progress in the energy sector, reducing regional disparitiest0 ^^m,*lating demand.    In pursuing this course no new dangers must ariseinf% r^aten the economic balance.    In particular, the efforts to reduceCoUru  .0n an(* disparities in cost and price trends between the individualr*es must be continued.
A common approach by means of complementary measures will help toainimize the internal and external economic policy constraints of indi-vidual member states and increase the effectiveness of such measures.All member states will take the necessary measures according to the.rooQ for maneuver under their respective economic policies.   The scopeavailable to individual member states depends, of course, on their differ-combat situations, notably the success of their efforts to fight inflation,their balance of payments situation, their foreign currency reserves, the size of their public sector deficits and the extent of their unusedproduction capacities.    Countries without inflation and balance of paymentsproblems will do more to increase domestic demand, in particular investmentienand and rate of economic growth.    Countries with steeply rising prices will first concentrate in particular on undesirable inflationary develop-cents.This coordinated approach in all areas of economic policy should helpstrengthen the confidence of investors and consumers in longer terra growthperspectives.2.   Monetary PolicyFollowing the discussion at Copenhagen on 7 April, the Europeantomcil has discussed the attached scheme for the creation of a closermonetary cooperation (European Monetary System) leading to a zone of mone-tary stability in Europe, which has been introduced by members of theEuropean Council.    The European Council regards such a zone as a highly desirable objective.   The European Council envisages a durable and effec-*ive scheme.    It, agreed to instruct the finance ministers at their meetingft 2h July to formulate the necessary guidelines for the competent commun^ytt^ct to A&quot;]*ho*-at.e by 31 October the provisions necessary for the function-f ing of such a scheme if necessary by amendment.    There will be concurrentstudies of the action needed to be taken to strengthen the economies ofthe less prosperous member countries in the context of such a scheme: suchAssures will be essential if the zone of monetary stability is to succeed,decisions can then be taken and commitments made at the European Councilfeting on h and 5 December.The Heads of Government of Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic ofStrrany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands state&apos; that the &quot;snake&quot; has not been^ is not under discussion.    They confirm that it will remain-fully intact3*   Measures to Promote EmploymentTrie European Council confirms its view that improving the employment^situation by means of increased growth is a crucial objective of the-&quot;-sr-unity.It notes that the Community is already providing considerable assis-taace through the European Social Fund and the European Regional Fund. It:&amp;lls upon the Council of Ministers of Labor and Social Affairs to decide
on measures to combat youth unemployment within the framework of theEuropean Social Fund so that such measures can come into force on1 January 1979*\.    Tripartite Conference with Both Sides of industry the European Council emphasizes the importance of tripartite confer-eaces with both sides of industry and welcomes the decision to hold anotherconference with both sides of industry in the autumn to consider, inaccordance with the outcome of the previous conference, the relationship between investment, employment and competition, work sharing and employmentin the services sector.5- energy the European Council emphasizes that efforts to resolve long-termenergy problems should be intensified at all levels.    The primary objectivefor all countries to reduce their dependence on oil imports.    In thisconnection the Community adopts the following objectives for 1985:- to reduce the Community1s dependence on imported energyto 50 per cent;- to limit net oil imports by the Community,- to reduce to 0.8 the ration between the rate of increasein energy consumption and the rate of increase in gross domestic production.The Community emphasizes the need for the other industrialised countries to set themselves similar objectives.Particular importance is attached to better use of the Community&apos;s-aergy resources, .prospection efforts and the development of new sources of energy.The contribution of nuclear energy alongside other forms of energy is vital and a matter of urgency for the Community.    It is also important thatVork should continue on ecological, safety and protection issues in order*0 take into account the particular need for some member states to find* solution to certain specific problems linked with the introduction orl5?lenentation of nuclear programs.Community measures on energy, particularly in order to promote energy-**ving and to exploit all alternative sources of energy are complementary* the member states1 considerable efforts.Apart from the new measures which it must take, the Community willlri future have to give special attention to the Joint appraisal and thecoordination of the individual member states&apos; energy programs.
- h -The European Council lays emphasis on the need for world-wide coopera-tion on energy and in particular indicates the willingness of the community and the member states to as*sist the developing countries, in cooperationvith other industrial countries, in surmounting their energy problems.6. Common MarketThe European Council is agreed that the safeguarding and developmentof the common market by further measures to remove trade barriers anddistortions of competition are a permanent task of the Community.7. International trade the European Council reaffirms its determination to strengthen the open world trading system through joint efforts.    It emphasizes the out-standing importance it attaches to substantial and balanced results ofthe GATT multilateral trade negotiations.    It calls upon all tradingpartners to make a constructive contribution to attaining this objective,in vhich the Community will play its part.   The expansion of world trade,the improvement of the international division of labor and sustainedeconomic growth are closely linked and are mutual prerequisites. TheCcraunity will take steps against protectionism in international tradettd accordingly calls for increased international cooperation and consul-tat ion.8. Structural policy the European Council concludes that preserving and improving thecompetitiveness of industry and increasing its innovativeness are importantrequirements for a higher level of economic growth and the creation of newjobs.   Consequently, a  &quot;rc.it.nr readiness to undergo structural changesc&apos;Jst be induced in firms and industries.    Such changes must, however, takePlace under socially acceptable conditions.   The Community is making its contribution to this by means of its financing instruments, which haverecently been considerably extended.   Where public intervention is justi-*ied in exceptional cases on specific economic and social grounds, theAssistance provided must be for a limited period and designed, subject tothe rules in the treaties of Rome, to facilitate structural adjustment.9. Mediterranean agriculture the European Council considers that the decisions taken by the Council^Ministers of Agriculture) on 12 May 1978 constitute a contribution tosolving the agricultural problems in the Community1s&quot;Mediterranean regions.*t noted with satisfaction that the Council (agriculture) had decided to*-opt a position by 30 September 1978 on the commission proposals still^tstanding.The Council is of the opinion that due consideration must continueto be given to the special agricultural structural and market problemslti the Mediterranean regions and in other less favored regions.
10.   Relations with the Developing countries the European Council is of the opinion that progress&apos; in the North-South dialogue is, essential for the solving of international economicproblens and the safeguarding of world peace and stability.    It reaffirmsits will to strike a balance of interests between North and South even indifficult times.    This requires the industrialized countries&apos; markets tobe open to products from the developing countries.    Full integration of the developing countries into the world trade system represents a considerablecontribution to this extension of world trade.At the same time the Community and the member states will continue and step up on a world-wide basis the development assistance which they. provide.Efforts to achieve constructive results in the current negotiations on a common fund and individual commodity agreements are to be continued.In this context, the stabilization of exports earnings should receivefurther study.The European Council regards the Lome convention as an important partof North-South cooperation and looks forward to successful negotiations onits renewal.The European Council considers that the world-wide interconnectionsbetween the economic activities of ail concerned including the state-trading countries call for common action on a basis of joint responsibility,tt continues to place its trust in a favorable climate of cooperation inthe United Nations and emphasizes the Community&apos;s firm resolve to renderforth-South relations mutually advantageous by means of cooperation,partnership and readiness to play a greater part.
annexANNEX TO THE SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS OF the presidency OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL- Bremen, 6 and 7 July 1978 -1. In terms of exchange rate management the European Monetary System (EMS)will be at least as strict as the &quot;Snake&quot;.     In the initial stages of its operation and for a limited period of time member countries currently notParticipating in the snake may opt for somewhat wider margins around centralrates.     In principle, interventions will be in the currencies of participa-ting countries.     Changes in central rates will be subject to mutual consent.Non-member countries with particularly strong economic and financial ties withthe Community may become associate members of the system.     The EuropeanCurrency Unity (ECU)(1) will be at the centre of the system;   in particular,it will be used oS a means of settlement between e.c. mcnetary authorities.2- An initial secret^iy of CCus (tor use among Coi.rr.unity central banks)will be created against oeposit of US dollars and gold on the one hand(e-9. 20 per cent of the stock currently held by if.enoer central banks) andmember currencies on the other hand in an amount of a comparable order of&quot;aonitude.The use of ECUs created against member currencies will be subject toEditions varying with the amount and the maturity;   dje account will be9iven to the need for substantial short-term facilities (up to one year).3- Participating countries will co-ordinate their exchange rate policiesvis-a-vis third countries.     To this end they will intensify the consulta-tions in the appropriate bodies and between central banks participating inthe scheme.     Ways to co-ordinate dollar interventions should be soughtd The ECU has the same definition as the European Unii of account.

EUROPEAN COMMUNITY COUNCIL(BREMEN MEfcTl ING)The Prime Minister (Mr. JamesCallaghau): 1 should like, with permis-sion, to report to tl e House on the meet-ing oi the European Council in llrcmenwhich 1 attended with my right lion.Friend the Eoreign and commonwealth secretary on 6th and 7th J uly.We were informed by the President ofthe Commission that the expected rateof growth in the Community countriesthis year, on present policies, would belower than expected. and we agreed that increased growth is a crucial objectiveto improve employment prospects. Asregards measures to combat yo :h un-employment. we called lor decisionswithin the framework, of the EuropeanSocial Fund to come &quot;into force on 1stJanuary 1979. All member States willtake necessary measures to increasegrowth according to their own individualcircumstances. But we agreed that coun-tries with smaller inflation and balanceol payments problems will do more toincrease domestic demand.We. agreed that a zone of monetarystability in Europe was a highly desirableobjective, as part of the concerted inter-national action needed for economic rc-covcry. The German and French Gov-ernments put forward for consideration a scheme for a European monetary sys-teni. A number of Heads of Govern-nient, including myself, wished to seethe details fully worked out before enter-ing into any commitment by our rcspec-tive Governments. We therefore agreedthat Finance Ministers should formulateguidelines for a possible scheme, takingas a starting point at their meeting on24th July the Franco-German proposals.Officials would subsequently elaboratethe necessary provisions by 31st October,and the final scheme would be in front of the meeting of the European Councilon 4th and 5th December for decision andcommitment.This agreed timetable will permit the fuller preparation and consideration which is essential for a durable scheme.We can thus hope to avoid the errors of1972 when the previous Governmentjoined a similar scheme on 1st May but were forced to withdraw only seven weeksCcte \0*S-\Ovulater, on 23rd June. However, the out-lines of the Franco-German proposalcontain some new features and the Gov-cnimcnt will play their full pan in theforthcoming stud.es.The Government have taken the viewthroughout these discussions that mone-tary arrangements are not enough by themselves to ensure a zone of monetarystability. Any new system must be onewhich will last and will take lull accountof the economic as well as monetaryinterests of each member of the Com-munity. Therefore, in company with others. I pressed for parallel studies tobe made of the action that is necessaryto ensure a greater convergence in the economies of the member countries,especially in such matters as the commit-ments to growth and transfers of real re-sources. It was agreed to carry out suchstudies.It will be necessary to judge how farall these matters have been satisfactorilyarranged when we are called upon totake a final decision on such new propo-sals as the Finance Council may putforward.There was a related discussion arisingout of the need for a better use of resources in supporting Mediterraneanagriculture. This led to an extensive dis-cusston of the common agricultural policy as a whole which brought out the dis-sali&amp;laction felt by a number of member governments with the present scale ofagricultural expenditure and with the costof financing surplus production. This wasthe most thorough and frank discussiono! the defects ol the common agricultural policy in which I have participated in theCommunity, and it revealed a great dealof support for our wish to see .a morebalanced distribution of the use of Coin-munity resources as a whole. The Corn-mission was asked to come back with proposals to remedy this at the nextEuropean Council.As regards energy, the Council adoptedobjectives for 1985 calling for the reduction-tion of the Community^ dependence on imported energy to 50 per cent, of its total requirements, including oil, and emphasised that oilier industrial countries should set themselves similar objectives.The Council expressed its readiness tomake progress with the developing coun-trics on such matters as trade, commodity
[The Prime Mini Ler.]support, stabilisation of export earnings and assistance.1 he Council discussed the situation inthe Middle Hast and Lebanon and in africa, it regretted the lack of progress towards a settlement in the Middle Bast,and rcafLrmcd the principles set out in thedeclaration issued by the Council inLondon on 29th June last year. TheCouncil agreed on the necessity for early and peaceful independence for Namibiaand Zimbabwe on die basis ol negotiatedand internationally acceptable solutionsand expressed support for the efforts which Britain is mailing, with others, totliis end.This was a constructive meeting inwhich there was some hard talkingbecause we were getting to grips withimportant problems. It&apos;, as a result, some new solutions can be agreed on the con-vcrgence ol&quot; our economies, on a /one of monetary stability and on the transfer of resources inside the Community, including a better use of. resources in the CAP, itcould turn out to have bee: a historicoccasion.Mrs. Thatcher: May I put three points to the Prime Minister, two on the econo-mic aspects oi&apos; his statement and a thirdon another aspect. The right hon. Gen-Ueman will recall that a short time agohe put up a live-point agenda to get usout of world recession, one of the main points of which was a currency slabilisa-tion scheme. We have to determine pre-cisely where the British interest lies andwe must theretore look at the details ofthe present scheme and any strings whichare attached to it, although it is a rather different scheme from that in 1972 towhich the Prime Minister referred. Butwiil the right hon. Gentleman agree,especially - in view of his previous vel-come for currency stabilisation schemes,that we are more likely to get out of theproblem of wor.d recession by co-operat-Ulg with our partners than we are bystanding aside from the scheme whichthey have put up?Second, ahhough we welcome the con-cept of a currency stabilisation scheme,will the Prime Minister agree that nosuch sc.::mc either will work or couldever be a substitute for running our owneconomy in a sound financial way, andwill he accept that one ol the things which shocked the British people was thetr.:t that we are now in the second divi.si on economically of European countries,and. since Britain was the victor inEurope, this comes very hard to the Bri-tisii people? However, that has nothing to do wii:l currency stabilisation schemes,it is the result of the way in which theGovernment have run the British economy recently.Th-rd, the Prime Minister referred toa number of foreign affairs matters. Whenhe and his colleagues were all together,did they discuss the trials now takingplace in the Soviet Union of Mr. Giiu-burg and Mr. Shcharansky, and did they come to any concerted view upon them?The Prime Minister: On the first ques-tion. 1 agree that the proposal which hasbeen put up 1 refer to the monetaryarrangements is rather different from thatof 1972. It is a great pity, however, thatthe Opposition when they were in Gov-ernment did not take the same precau-tions that wc are taking now. 1 hope to learn from their mistakes in this matter.Of course it is belter to co-operate than to stand aside. Indeed. I think that this. what 1 have been preaching over thepast 12 months. We shall continue toexamine these matters constructively. Iam very ready to do anything which willstrengthen our own currency and give itgreater reserves, provided that our other interests arc satisfied. We shall look atthe scheme in that way. I think thatthat was fully understood by everybody.On-the second point, the right hon.Lady is echoing my own words, that none ol these schemes can be a sub-slilute for running our own economyproperly. This is indeed what I havebeen trying to do, with no support fromthe Opposition, through the industrialstrategy and through trying to overcomeinflation. 1 must remind the right lion.Lady, when she talks about the dcterio-roiion in our situation, that inflation was much higher when she left office thanit is now, and was going up and wasforecast to go up over the next 12 months.Therefore, I do not think that it comesvery well from the right hon. Lady to talk a*bout the way iu which wc havebeen running our economy recently. Itis because of the way in which wc havebeen running it recently that this country
has more hope for the future thai it everhad during the early years of Hie 1970s.The trial of Mr. Slicharansky was not mentioned at the European Council ofMinisters, but it is clear that if tha soviet union goes ahead with the trial ii willplace a&quot; very severe test upon relationsbetween it and other count! cs. it seemsto bear sotne of the ha! marks of a return to the trials wc knew in Stalinistdavs. That cannot but effect our relation?:.hip$.Mr. Jay: In studying the so-calledcurrency siabilisation scheme, do wc haveto learn yet again that fixed exchange rates usually lead to unemployment? Canmy right hon. friend assure the house that we shall not accept any schemesresembling this until wc have had a genuine reform of the common agiicul-lure policy and a reasonable Germancontribute a to the exchange costs ofour forces in Germany?The Prims Minister: My right hon.Friend is not as accurate :*s usual whenhe says thai fixed exchange rate; lead to unemployment. That depends upon thenature of the economy one is running.As I keep on saying to (he Briti-.lipeople, what is at stake here is I henature of our productivity and ourefficiency am! whether we have- inflation.1.iat will determine the level o: Qhcm-ploymcnt Therefore, I hope that myright hon. Friend will not desert a viewthat he held for many years about thedesirability of having less flexibility in exhange rates because of his dislike ofthe Common Market as a whole.On the question of the CAP. I havemade it quite clear over many months,and. indeed, over years as has my right on. Friend the Minister of Agriculture.Fisheries and Food that it is a matter which needs the most substantial reorgau-isation. What I think is now being seen by a number of members of the Com-munity is that giving more help to theMediterranean countries cannot be doneby increasing the total budget. Theagricultural budget is large enough, ifindeed not too large. Therefore, if thereis to be additional help for the Merii-terranean countries it must come froma red siribution of resources between certain countries and the Mediterraneancountries which might seek to benefit.The  Commission has  been  asked toexamine all that and to bring forward proposals in December.Mr. Ivu.sc!! Johnston: Is the PrimeMinister aware that the Liberals verymuch welcome the major proposal of aparallel currency backed by a Europeanmonetary fund, which is part of the mani-festo of European Liberal democrats?Despite the existence of certain economicVisigwJis around the right hon. Gentle-man, can lie assure the House that it isthe Governments hope and intention tosee the details that he mentions workedoui posiliveiy by the end of the year?The Prime Minister: I hope to seeanything which will lessen monetary instability-bility, which I think has been part ofthe cause of the decline in internationaluade. though obviously not the wholecau*e. I have been one of the most ferventadvocaies of monetary stability.What I should like the House, includ-ing the Liberal Party to accept, as imagine and hope that that party does,is that monetary stability will not beachieved unless there is greater conver-gence between economies. That is theessential principle that we had to get into the original proposal. It was notthere. The proposal seemed to mc to beshowing a substantial weakness because it was not there. That is what was got inat my insistence. is (omething that wemust consider between now and Decem-ber. If we could get both those things,that could be of advantage to the UntiedKingdom as well as to Europe.Mr. Roper: I congratulate my right on. Friend on the realism he brought tothe discussions in Bremen. Can he assure the House that it is perfectly appropriate for the Government to maintain.a reserveon the speciiic proposals until the discus-sions in the Council of Foreign ministers have made quite clear how the proposals on a /one of monetary stability can be linked with specific proposals which leadto a convergence of European economiesas a whole?The Prime Minister: Two studies arcto run in parallel. 1 hope that the pro-jxvcals on both will be equally tangiblewhen they appear. Then il will be for theGovernment to judge whether they arein Britain*s interests. 1 hope that theywill be. but we shall have to wait and seethe details.
Mr. Maurice Macml!tan : Will the right on. Gentleman accept meanwhile thatit does not make it easier to control infta-tion in this country if he allows insexchange rate policy to increase themoney supply unduly.&apos; Will talks on general economic tuturc of the Com-mumly include the present position in africa and the diilicuhics that the Luro-peans and Japnne.se might &quot;experience ifthere were to be any interference withaccess to raw materials and mineralslrom that Continent? tThe Prime Minister: I think that theexchange rate policy is well known. Itis not proceeding unsatisfactorily. Ster-ling has been stable now for many months, and that is oi&quot; assistance to ourindustrialists, who prefer a stable ex-change rate. It has varied only withina very small ratio. Indeed, nxlay it seemsto be singularly strong, but i do notthink that we should look at any one day. any one week or any one month.Over a period sterling is pretty stable,so it is having no adverse impact onmonetary policy, which, as the right hon.Gentleman knows, is well under controlat present.As regards discussions on Africa, thereis growing concern about the consc-quences to employment in Europe if therewere interruption of supplies from Afri-can countries, including, of course, SouthAfrica. But these matters, which arecommercial matters are not discussed in open council.Mrs. Castle: Is not the intention be-hind the proposals not merely greatermonetary stability but the creation of acommon European currency as the first step towards full monetary and economic union, which in turn will lead inevitablyto a Federal Europe, for which the peopleof this country have never voted? There-fore, will riiy right hon. Friend continueto refuse to give any commitment, evenin principle, until the House has had afull opportunity to examine the details and vote on them&apos;.&apos;The Prime Minister: There is no doubtthat any increases in monetary stabilitycan lead in due course to common Furo-pcan currencies and to the kind of silua?con that my right hon. Friend forecastsand indeed fears. I do not have suchfears, because the British Parliament andthe British people will always judee thismatter against what they believe to be their proper interests in these matters.But I think that it would be a long way many years from having a greaterzone of monetary stability to the^ com-mon European currency that my right on. Friend forecasts. Indeed, such athing would he possible and sustainable-otherwise, no Government could pos-sibly accept it or live with it only ifthere were a convergence of Europeaneconomies. If that happened and raised the standard of life of the British people,I should be the first to cheer.Mrs. Winifred Ewing: May I follow up the question of the right hon. Mem-bcr lor Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) ami ask the Prime Minister to explain to me howit is that he has given assurances in answer to me and other hon. Membersthat there is no question of the Govern-mcnt&apos;s committing themselves to the prin-ciple of economic and monetary union?How cioes he square that with thosewords of his statement in which he talksabout entering into a commitment byhis Government? Is there not a betrayalof past assurances to the Mouse here?The Prime Minister: No. Sir. Thelion. Lady should try to understand wl Dlshe reads.  What my statement says is&quot; A number of Heads ?f Government wishedto sec Ibc details fully worked out beforeentering into any commitment by our respective governments.&quot;That is no betrayal of principle at all. Iam sure that this matter will be discussed by Parliament, probably on more thanone occasion, before it conies into being.But. with respect to some hon. Mem-&apos;bers; 1 hope that they will not enter intothis matter with all their antennae quivcr-ing because, of preconceived ideas, bc-cause of their dislike of our original decision. We must judge it, and theyWill be betraying their interests if theydo not St) judge it. against what is in thebest interests of Britain, in raising cm-ploymenl. achieving stable monetary con-ditions and engendering a higher rate of growth.Mr. Gould: Is my right hon. Friendaware that there is widespread relief,both inside and outside Parliament, thathe WOjS strong-minded enough to resist a pro v a! which would lock us into thepresent   unsatisfactory   situation, and
would block off one of the last remain-ins escape routes from the dilemmaposed-for us by the obstructive attitudeof creditor countries? Can he say whatpowers he will have stop this danger-ous development if the damaging pcicn-tia! becomes even clearer over the next six months than it is now?The Prime Minister: The present scheme standing by itself is not satis-factory. 1 made that clear, although there &quot;was some pressure for me to goalong for the uakc of agreement. If WCcould get some of the redistribution of resources that 1 would welcome- Mr. Skinner: If.The Prime Minister: Of course it is&quot; if&quot;. My hon. Friend is not the onlyone who has done a little negotiation inh:s time. As I was say ng, if we couldgel some of the redistribution of re-sources, it would be certainly worth ourwhile to examine it and see. But at theend of the day, as my hon. Friend him-self has made clear, wc shall have to takea decision whether we re-enter the snakeor do not re-enter the snake, whatevername it is given. 1 shall look at it onthat basis. 1 shall not make the mistakemade by the Conservative Govenmjent,who did not work out the scheme pro-perly and did not set the conditions they wanted. We shn::!J :;!&apos;. of us at -vailtry to learn from their mistakes.Mr. Amery: I fully appreciate theneed for giving carctul study to theGerman-French proposals, but is thePrime Minister aware that we have paid a very high price lor our refusal undersuccessive Governments to join the coal and steel pool, for tailing to join theEuropean Defence Community, and for.not getting Into the Common Marketearlier? Is he further aware that;although there may be obvious difficulties in thescheme at the moment, even if travellingwith the convoy means a rough passagefor a bit, it may be very much moreuncomfortable and lonelier not to be ina convoy at all?The Prime Minister: There are vary-ing views whether we paid a high price inthese matters the right hon. Gentlemanhas some knowledge of ihem. But ! am bound to remind him of what he hasobviously forgoiten that between 1stMay 1972 and 23rd June 1972 it cost us$2 billjon in seven weeks. That was muchloo high a price to pay for joining ascheme that was clearly unsuitable. Wemust have regard to the costs of thisscheme and the benefits that will accrue.It is no use joining a convoy if, afierseven weeks, one has to jump overboardWithout a lifebelt.Mr. Spearing: Will my right hon.Friend expand a little on the question of decision? Is it not a fact&apos; that theEuropean Council is not a forma!council? Will this scheme be promotedas a draft regulation by the Commissionand subject to the piocedures of thisHons.- p: ior to the meeting in December?My right hon. Friend savs that it wouldpromote s!abiliiy. but even if that wereirue. would it not do so at the expense ofthe authority of Her MajestyN Govern-mcnl to order our own internal financesas they wished?The Prime Minister: I cannot answermy hon. Friend&apos;s first question whetherit would be a regulation. No one has gotdown to that kind of discussion yet. he asked whether it would remove somepowers from us. The answer is *&apos; Yes &quot; ;all thes^ nailers remove powers from us.When we joined NATO. WC removedsome powers from ourselves but it was thegenera! view of the House, continued fora quarter ol a century, that in removingthese powers we increased our security.That is surely the test that one needs toapply to this sort of proposal. If it meantlessening powers in order to increase pros-perity. the House would have to take adecision whether it wished to remainpoor and independent or whether it war.willing to sacrifice some powers and bemore prosperous.Severn! Hon. Members rose-Mr. Speaker: There is another state-mcnt to follow. ! propose to allow fourmore questions from each side of theHouse, which will be a very good runindeed.Mr. Nelson: I welcome the PrimeMinisters statement, but will he accept that many of us see it as a first and vvel-comc move towards full monetary union in Europe and the establishment of acommon currency? The Prime minister referred to the precondition of economies in Europe moving together befoie such
. v!r. Nelson.]a currency could be established. In thiscountry we have areas of diller^nt ccono-mic performance, vet we have one cur-rency. Why is it not possible within theEuropean context also to have one com-mon currency for different economies andcountries of differing performances?The Prime Minister: The hon. Gentle-man hits on the correct point. We cansustain one currency in this country only because there are substantial resourcetransfers between varying parts oi theUnited Kingdom, from which Scotlandand Wales have benefited considerably, asNorthern Ireland will in due course. Thesame condition must apply over a largergeographical area. This is why. before giving :. reply to this particular mone-lary proposal. I have made it an essential condition that I should know what is to happen in the matter of monetary re-sources. The hon. Gentleman has sum-nied up my stand on this question admir-ably.\!r.MacFarquhar: While one knowsthat one has to Wait for the detailed work-ing out by ollicials and Finance Minis-ten, could my right hon. Friend sayhere and now whether ChancellorSchmidt, whose country would have tobear the biggest burden of resource trans-fer. at least indicated in principle that hewas willing to increase West Germuny*contribution to regional and social funds and also to European growth?The Prime Minister: No one was askedto give any answers in principle ai the weekend, so I cannot say what Chancel-lor Schmidi&apos;s view would be on ihatWhether the amount of resources wouldbe increased is a matter that will have tobe found out when we embark on the studies. What could well p.ace with-out any increase of resources would bea greater diversion from the common agri-cultural policy cost to the social fund.That could take place without anyaddition, although 1 would like tosee an addition. Chancellor Schmidtis being attacked in Germany forhis proposal in this matter because thereare people there who believe that iiwould be disadvantageous to Germanyand advantag rous to other countries. Soperhaps ail 01 us had belter stand back,sec how the scheme develops and thenlook how far we can each get our advantage or disadvantage from ii.Mr. Hdrdern: As one of the main objectives ol these proposals is that ofEuropean economic integration, wouldnot this purpose equally well be served inthe meantime, before any agreement isreached, by allowing free convertibilityof Luiopean countries, particularly of sterling.? Is it not also a remarkable com-mentaiy on the prospects for this country that the Prime Minister should see that under a Labour Government a!! he is ready concerned with is quibbling aboutresources which should be transferred from richer European countries 10 GreatBritain?The Prime Minister: Ihat is a veryunfair way of putting it. As the hon.Gentleman knows, the Government havebeen concerned, both through their attackon inflation and through the 38 sectorworking parlies, to try to improve the performance of British industry, which lies at the key to this situation. It isno: sullicicnt to say that I an) concerned only with the transfer of resources. Evenif I were. I would he bound to say thatit is a great pity that the conservative government were not sufficiently con-cerocd before they lost S2 billion in sevenweek:; in 1972. That arose because therewas a lock of convergence in the ccono-mies of the Community thenMr. Walkinson : Does my right hon.Friend agree that his opening words mean that the high asp.rations of the Copcn-hagen summit in terms of economic growth have now been abandoned? Canlie say what this will mean for uncm-ployment in Europe next year? Arc thecontinentals prepared to approach theproblem of unemployment as a structuralone and support the sort of measures that are being taken in this country toprotect Jobs?The Prime Minister: It is irue that the expected rate of growth in Europe as awhole will lead, unless it is remedied, to higher unemployment in Europe as aWhole during 1979. This is a factor thatthose present had to take into account,and that is why it is. in my view, cssen-lial [hat at the Conn conference nextweekend there should be undertakings toincrease&apos; the rate of growth by thosecountries which arc in a position to doit as quickly as possible.   1 should like
to remind my hon. Friend that ] saidspecifically that there was agreement that increased growth is a crucial objective in improving employment prospecs. Noone dissented from that view. I take it.therefore, that it applies io everybody.As for the structural nature of uncni-ployinent, there are di!Terences of view between members of the Community asto how. this should be met. bat so farI have not seen any belter proposals thanthose which the Government have under-taken. They ha\e resulted in consider-able aid to companies and firms whichhave been in some distress, and have resulted in keeping in employment some400.000 people.Mr. Tapsell: By how many percentagepoints does the right lion. Gentleman ex-neet the rate of inflation in Britain overthe next 12 months to exceed thai inthe Federal Republic of Germany?The Prime Minister: It will depend ona number of factors, including the levelof inflation [Interruption.] I beg the hon. Gentlcman*s pardon. It will dependon a number of factors, including thestrength cf sterling. That is what I wishedto say. I apologise to the House for aslip of the tongue. It will depend on several factors. incQuding the strengthof sterling, the price of imported com-modiiies and a number of factors of thatsort. A ereat part of the very low rateof inflation in Germany the lowest in iheworld, i snou&apos;d think, at the present time is due to the strength of the deutsch-mark. [HON. MEMBERS: 44 Why? H I willtell hon. Gentlemen that it is because theGermans are so successful in exporting.It is because they are able to. have a bigbalanee of payments surplus. I continu-al!\ impress all these things on theOpposition. T have no doubt that one day they will agree with me that theyare true. &apos;Dr. Bray : Did my right hon. Friendhave any discussion with his colleaguesabout the circumstances in which and ihefrequency with which exchange ratesmight be adjusted under the new schemeto take account of differing rnte* of lulla-lion?The Prime Miliisk-r: Yes. there was some preliminary discussion about that.It was pointed out that at the presenttime there are facilities in the sna.\e.Indeed, many adjustments in rales havebeen made over a weekend when it hasbeen thought necessary to do so. Butthere was no detailed discussion. Itwill be a matter for the Finance ministers to consider in preparing the scheme.Sir Anthony Royle : Is the Prime Minis-ter aware that many of our friends over-seas, arid aiso those who voted ** Yes&apos;&quot; inthe rcierendum. will view with gloom thePrime Ministers negative reaction to theproposals concerning European monetaryreform?If other Heads of Government man-aged to i!o their homework and to pr i-vlde positive reaction to the proposals putforward, will the Prime Minister explainwhy he was not able to do the same?The Prime Minister: It is a matter ofopinion whether it will be viewed withgloom, but there is really no case for theridiculous euphoria with which the Con-servaiivc Government entered in a light-hearted manner into a scheme from whichthey had to retreat with ignominy in lessthan two months. I do not propose to repeat that mistake, even though the hon.Gentleman invites me to do so. I do not know what homework was needed inorder to produce that piece of paper. 1do not think that much was needed. It isa question where our political and econo-mic interests lie. Ou:* do not. happenalways to lie in the same direction asthose of the other countries. Some ofthem are getting very great benefit outof the common agricultural policy and do not want it to be touched at all. Weare not.Mr. Ron Thomas : Will my right hon.Friend&quot; agree that exchange rates are not simply determined by rates of growth in countries but more often than not bymassive flows of speculative funds? Willhe agree that the only way, therefore.&quot; inwhich the kind of policy suggested couldbe sustained is by economic and monetaryunion, and by the BritiNh people having to give up the right io determine theirown economic future? Given that theEuropean Common Market countries are certainly bankrupt in terms of ideas todeal with unemployment, can my right on. Friend tell us why we are moving inthis direction?The Prime Minister: I go part of theWay with my lion. Friend. I think thatin the short run exchange rates can bevery   much   influenced   b) speculative
[The Prime Minister.]flows, as indeed was the case in theautumn of 1976, when sterling was de-pressed far below its real exchange value.That is the case, therefore, for examininga scheme of tins sort, lo see whether, by putting sufficient reserves behind a centralfund, it will he possible lo prevent liteMachinations of the speculators. J urnsure that my hon. Friend would be infavour of that. It might mean giving up some control, but we would have to judge,at the end of the day, whether it was worth giving up the control in order tlxbelter 10 protect our currency, providedthat the other conditions tlr.it f haveenumerated arc also fulfilled.Mr. Heath: The Prime Minister hasbeen working himself into a frenzy aboutthe events of the sp.i:ig and summer of1972. I remind him that at thai limeBritain was not a member of the Com-muniiy. What happened was that britain was forced oif an existing parity by speculation-laiion against sterling, in exactly thesame way, as ihe Prime Minister recalled,us in 197G-and. indeed, as happened atthe time when he devalued the pound.None of the events, therefore, ol thosethree periods bears any relationship tothe scheme which was put forward lotiie Prime Minister at the recent meeting.!s the Prime Minister no! aware thatthe whole dillerencc between the present occasion and previous occasions is that the proposed scheme gives a backing loaM currencies in order lo avoid their being pushed oil their panties or undulydepreciated by speculation ogaiiist thosecurrencies? Jt is, in fact, a scheme which1 put lo the German Chancellor in May1973.Is the Prime Minister not aware thatthe importance of this initiative [Interruption.] I know that Labour Mem-ben below the Gangway do not like a progressive scheme of this kind. Is thePrime Minister not aware that the irhpor-tnncc of this scheme is that the presentGerman Chancellor has been prepared to commit high German reserves in order togei stability in European currencies, andthat the scheme ought therefore to be welcomed?May I ask the Prime Minister not toRive the impression that he is trying toavoid the scheme on principle by insist-M*g on unlimited discussion on detail.&apos;The Prime Minister: 1 think that therig it hon. Ccnilcmah-s memory fails him.I here are. of course, members of thesnake now who are not members of theCommunity, and who arc in exactly thesame position as that of Britain in 1972,when we entered the snake. It was nota question whether we were a member of!!ie -immunity. It was a fact that we entered the snake at a rate of $2-61 andhad to emerge seven weeks later at $2-45,having lost $2 billion. That is sonic-l;:ing that is i it worth repeating.This scheme is not an exact parallel toprevious schemes. That is why I ihinkwe ought lo look at it. There is a pro-posal io put behind ii not just Germanreserves but also British reserves and ihcreserves of all Community countries. Thatwould make a useful fund, although itwould not, add the equivalent of$50 billion, which I have seen stated,because some of this would be a meretransfer of reserves and not the creationof a new fund.I draw the 1972 parallel only becauseyesterday the right hon. and learnedMember for Surrey, East (Sir G. Hi we)was pretending on the radio that this was something very new, and that it only wehad handled our affairs properly over thelast lour years wc would be able to goalong with it. I thought that it wasv. ihwhile drawing the historical parallel,and pointing out that the Conservativestried it and failed and that we ought lo do something a little different and a little better.Mr. English : On a point of order. Mr.Speaker. Quite unintentionally, out ofthe kindness of your heart, after annouu-influencing that you would call only four ques-practitioners, you allowed a. ConservativePrivy Councillor lo choose to be the lastquestioner. May I suggest. Sir, that infuture you should choose the order ofquestioners yourself?Several Hon. Members rose-Mr. speaker: Order. I extended acourtesy lo a former Prime Minister. Ishall do the same for the hon. member for Nottingham, West (Mr. English) whenhe L of that tank.Mr. Skinner : On a point of order. Mr.Speaker. Notwithstanding that slightingreference to my hon. L-rieud the Member
for Nottingham. West (Mr. English),perhaps you will explain lo me and lo aJot of other Government supporters why it was necessary to have a statement madeon this matter by the existing PrimeMinister and then at the very end to allowanother statement to be made by a formerPrime Minister the one who used tocome with all the sunshine stories aboutthe Common Market, the one whodragged in the British people, and the one who,is now trying to make exei.se-.&apos;.&apos; Isit not time that you gave opportunities tothose Government supporters who willlight to the bi&apos;.ter end against theCommon Market, in the way that youyourself used to do?Hon. Members: Order.Mr. Speaker: I have to tell the hon.Member lor Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) thathe needs to change his v.ays in addressingme. [Hon. Mumulks: &quot;Jiear, hear.&quot;J the speaker of this House is not here to bebailied by anyone, and the hon. member for Bolsover had better bear that in mind.
