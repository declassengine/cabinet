DqCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 110COPY NO23 October 1978CABINETSEAT BELTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for transport. On 21 July 1977 (CM(77) 27th Conclusions, Minute 4) cabinet considered a package of road safety proposals (CP(77)83 ) about legislationcovering drinking and driving, the compulsory wearing of seat belts andrestrictions on motor-cyclists.    In summing up, the Prime Minister saidthat although there was wide support in the Cabinet for such legislation, itwas of a kind suitable for a new Parliament, not the present one.    It do not wish to reopen the question of comprehensive road safety legislation.However, I believe that there is now a strong case for a Bill in the new session dealing solely with the compulsory wearing of seat belts by peopletravelling in the front seats of cars.2. In the first place, it is clear that we have exhausted the &quot;educational&quot;approach to seat belt wearing.    Although the increased advertising budget for road safety has been welcomed, seat belt publicity does not raise wearingrates, currently around 30 per cent, by more than a few percentage points.The major conference on road safety held in June (the first ever of its kindorganised by Government) was acknowledged as an earnest of our concern.But the virtually unanimous view was expressed that only legislation on seatbelts could demonstrate the Government&apos;s good faith and credibility. AYear ago it was possible to argue that the pressure of other business(devolution, direct elections) had kept legislation out of The Queen&apos;s Speech.This time such an argument will not wash,3* Secondly, there is the important and wider question of theGovernment&apos;s whole approach to the opportunities provided by the coming session.    We do not wish it to be said that we are marking time and avoidinganything that is controversial.    A Bill on seat belts would be widely welcomed by middle opinion and those sceptical of our decision to carry on.    It wouldDe likely to get a good Press as evidence that we are not a lame-duckadministration looking for easy options.    The omission of such legislation would be noted unfavourably.4* On the substance of the matter, I will not rehearse the argumentse*cept to remind Cabinet that legislation on seat belts is by far the mostef*ective single action (in all areas of policy) that the Government can take10 save lives and injuries and the misery and cost that goes with them.Compulsory seat belt wearing could save up to 1, 000 lives and 10, 000 serious^juries every year.    The fall in casualties would in turn save the national health Service  5 million a year and the police  1 million a year with thetotal economic saving in the region of about  50 million a year.
5. Compulsory seat belt wearing commands wide support inParliament, the Press and amongst public opinion.    However, I recognisethat there is a significant and determined minority that objects in principle to compulsion.    It is, in fact, an unusual form of law to the extent that its main purpose is to make every individual protect himself (rather than others) from the consequences of his own actions.    I have therefore been considering whether a Contracting-out scheme could be devised to allowindividuals who claim that compulsion in this form infringes personalliberty to be exempt from the legal consequences.    A tentative scheme isoutlined in the Annex to this paper.6. I do not deny that such a uli Iimiii would be open to criticism on variousgrounds, practical and legal.    There are precedents designed to meet thespecial circumstances of seat belt wearing:  for example Germany and norway began with legal compulsion without penalties.    It must concernme, however, that &quot;contracting out&apos; might significantly reduce the level ofwearing.    There is no way of measuring this, but my own best guess(allowing for inertia) is that it would reduce the effective level of wearingfrom 80 per cent (withcut such provision) to about 60 per cent.    This would still be twice the present level and therefore a valuable gain in terms oflives saved and injuries avoided.    A Bill weakened by such a clause wouldbe better than no Bill at all.&apos;* The Bill would have one substantive clause, embodying provisionfor necessary exemptions, including medical grounds and while reversingthe car, and a second, if &apos;contracting-out&apos; is adopted.    I see no reason why the Bill should not be ready for early introduction and Second Readingbefore Christmas.    The Bill would become operative following aCommencement Order or at a due date, say 1 January 1980.8* There would be no European Economic Community implications, andno staffing or expenditure implications unless a Contracting-out&apos; clause is included.9* I seek the agreement of colleagues to preparation of a draft Bill for legislation Committee, including or excluding the personal option as mycolleagues may prefer..       . &apos;W T r department of Transport2 3 October 19782
(confidential)ANNEXContracting-out *   We have to take account of people who object to compulsory-wearing of seat belts because they regard compulsion as an infringement of personal liberty.    The Bill would provide thatsuch people should, on registering their objection, be1 contracted-out from the penalties v/hich v/ould otherwise apply&quot;to non-wearers.2. The aims of a scheme operated under such a clause must bethat:(a) those wishing to take advantage of it should have a clear and simple procedure to follow;(b) it should be simple for the police to operate.3. In outline the scheme would be as follows:(a) During the period between Royal Assent and the operative date we should issue appropriate publicityabout the provision, telling people how to applyif they so wished;(b) Those wishing to apply would, in the presence of awitness, sign a declaration on the lines indicatedbelow and send it, with a small fee sufficient tocover the costs of maintaining the register, to a central address;(c) They v/ould then be sent a certificate giving theirname, age and address;(d) If they v/ere stopped by a policeman for not wearinga seat belt, they would have either to produce the certificate on the spot or to submit it within 5days, as for the production of a driving licence,if they wished to avoid prosecution;(e) Applications could be made after the Act comes intooperation, but certificates would not afford impunityfor offences committed before their date of issue;
(confidential)(f) Compulsion would extend to all front seat users(except the limited categories under (g) below)*drivers and passengers alike, and any person overthe age of 17 (the age at which a person can beissued with a licence to drive a car), whether ovnot a licence holder, could apply for a certified&apos;Passengers under the age of 17 wouDd not be eli 1Dto obtain a certificate and it would be an offencefor a driver to permit such a passenger to travel in the front seat of his car without wearing a sea*belt unless the passenger was in an exempt(g) The scheme would be completely separate from otherexemptions for which we would be taking powers *0provide by regulation; for instance, exemption on medical grounds or exemption when the driver wasreversing.4. The declaration would be on the following lines:&quot;Although I am warned by Her Majestyfs Governmentthat I am   more likely to suffer death or injury if I do fl0*wear my seat belt than if I do wear it I declare my objecti03on principle to being compelled to do so for my own protectand I hereby apply to contract-out under Section        of &quot;the seat Belts Acre.&quot;5. The cost and manpower requirements of a register wouldrelatively high in the period between Royal Assent and the operative date.   Assuming that period to be about 6 months nshould need, for each 1 million applications, about 120 s*alat a cost of some  0.5 million.    After that the demand. frO0Jpeople reaching the age of 17 or deciding to registerbelatedly, would be at a much lower level.   Applications atthe rate of  m a year would require about 16 staff at anannual cost of  0.1 million.   The cost would be recovered ^charging an appropriate fee.(confidential&quot;)
