J DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 102COPY NO12 October 1978CABINETEXPENDITURE ON EDUCATION. LIBRARIES,SCIENCE AND ARTS 1979-83Memorandum my the Secretary of State for Education and science and Paymaster general. In the ordinary way I would of course present the case for my public expenditure programmes across the Cabinet table.    But, as the chief secretary, Treasury, recognises in paragraph 8 of CP(78) 99, there is aparticular problem about school meals which profoundly affects these and indeed other programmes - and, as I would maintain, our wider economicand social policies as well.    The purpose of this memorandum is to suggesthow we might deal with the problem.2. The Annex gives details of my proposals for additional expenditure which, in 1979-80, total between  90 million and  100 million.    All are important for our policies for education, science and industry (includingmicro-electronics) and the arts.    Some, especially mandatory awards for16-18 year olds - which might be limited in the first year from September1979 to 16 year olds in order to reduce the cost (ss in line 16(B) of the annex) while still making a significant impact on unemployment (about30, 000) and for which legislation is being prepared - are also important forwider economic and political reasons and would be warmly welcomed by theTrades Union Congress (TUC).3. As the Annex shows, I can virtually cover these additions in 1979-80from a package of savings, some of them painful, in local authority current expenditure which have already been identified with the local authority associations for the purposes of rate support grant (RSG) next year. Butthe Chief Secretary, Treasury, proposes that we should use all these savings in order to cover the under-provision of  100 million on school meals whichwill result if the charge (at present 25p) is not to rise by more than 3p nextyear.    Restraint in the school meals charge is an objective which I support,and it is also of importance to the TUC.    But it is related to pay policy (and family support policy) rather than to educational priorities, as were recognised in the spring when we cancelled an increase in the school mealscharge that was due in September 1978.    We decided to meet the cost of 60 million in 1978-79 from the contingency reserve.1
4. In my view it would be right to do much the same now, again for reasons of pay policy.    We should increase the charge by a maximam of3 p in September 1979;  announce this decision before the RSG negotiationsfor 1979-80 are concluded next month;  base public expenditure planningfigures for subsequent years on a subsidy of half the gross cost, as I proposed to the Home and Social Affairs Committee in June;  and charge theadditional expenditure of about  100 million in each year to the contingency reserve.    This would reduce the reserve next year from  900 million toabout  800 million, the level originally proposed by the Chief Secretary,Treasury, in CP(78) 69 in June.5. If this is agreed, I can otherwise manage within my existing programme for 1979-80.    However the annex shows that I would need some more resources in the subsequent years as the savings fall short of theproposed additions.    The net additions to my programmes are about 70 million in 1980-81,  130 million in 1981-82 and  120 million in 1982-83,with corresponding increases in some cases for Scotland and Wales.    In thefirst of these years this might mean a further charge on the contingency reserve.    In the othet two when, as the Chief Secretary, treasury s papershows, the position is likely to be somewhat easier, there should be scope for more expenditure on the social services generally.conclusions. I invite the Cabinet:-i.       to approve the proposals in paragraph 4 for school meals;ii.       to endorse the proposals in the Annex for increases and reductions in other education and related programmes includingthe introduction of mandatory awards for 16-18 year olds,beginning with 16 year olds only in September 1979; and.       to agree to the necessary net additions to those programmes in 1980-83 summarised in paragraph 5.S w department of Education and Science12 October 19782
