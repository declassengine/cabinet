DqCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(78) 108COPY NO23 October 1978CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE: EDUCATION,HEALTH AND SOCIAL SECURITYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and science and Paymaster General, the Secretary of State for social Services, the Secretary of State for Scotland, theSecretary of State for Wales and the Minister for Social SecuritySCHOOL MEAL CHARGE1. It was remitted to us by Cabinet on 17 October (CM(78) 35thConclusions, Minute 4) to recommend how the remaining  57 million fromthe  100 million reduction in the Contingency Reserve might be apportionedto meet the further essential needs of the education, health and social security programmes.    We have made a conscientious attempt to arrive at areasonable and equitable solution within this remit but we have been forced tothe conclusion that no satisfactory answer can be found so long as the cost ofany likely decision on the school meal charge has to be found from withinexisting programmes or the amount available from the Contingency Reserve.2. The crux of the problem is that the planning figures for educationimply that the present charge of 25p a day for school meals will increase by 23p in September 1979,   As already recognised by the Home and social affairs Committee, this is wholly unrealistic.    We surmise that the onlyrealistic options for the school meals charge are for the present price of25p to be increased by 5p or 3p from next September.    Restricting theincrease to 5p or to 3p which some colleagues may regard as more acceptable,would cost  98 million (Great Britain) or  111 million (Great Britain).Por this to come oil the education programmes would mean unacceptablesavings (beyond those indicated in CP(78) ) 02 or abandoning all the additionalproposals there).3. To avoid these effects, virtually all of the  57 million at our disposalwould have to be allocated as a contribution to the cost of keeping the mealcharge increase at a modest level, leaving nothing for the pressing needs ofhealth and social security.    We suggest therefore that the best way out ofthis dilemma WOuld be for colleagues to agree to a further  50 million tocome from the 1979-80 Contingency Reserve, reducing it to  750 million.(The cost of freezing the school meal charge this year -  60 million in^978-79 - was similarly met from the Contingency Reserve).    On the basisQf a 5p charge, this would leave  48 million to be met from savings in theOreat Britain education programmes.    The remaining savings would then be allocated to the additional proposals for education, science and the arts.1
EDUCATION MAINTENANCE ALLOWANCES4. We believe that the cost of a scheme for educational maintenanceallowances (EMAs) in England and Wales (and for any related improvementof the existing Scottish scheme) should be found from the additional provisionfor employment to which the Cabinet agreed on 17 October.    A commitment in due course to a scheme for EMAs for all 16-18 year olds was made by theCabinet in May (CM(78) 18th Conclusions, Minute 5).    This was announced in Parliament and subsequently discussed in detail with the LocalEducation Authorities.    No decision was then taken on the cost or date ofimplementation, but the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and the Labour Partyhave very recently reaffirmed their support for a scheme on the lines of thatdescribed in CP(78) 70.    A similar means tested national scheme, withgrants of up to  7. 50 a week, but confined to 16 year olds only in the first year and introduced in September 1979, would cost  51 million in 1979-80.On introduction it would remove about 25, 000 people from the unemploymentregister, quite apart from the educational advantages discussed in CP(78) 70.5. The view of the Secretary of State for Employment is that EMAs arenot a measure for inclusion in the programme of special measures againstunemployment.    In his view, it would be a great mistake to present EMAssimply as an employment measure rather than as the significant socialreform in further education that it is.    The measure would have employ-ment implications but he points out that this is true of the measures takenhy a number of Departments, the financial responsibility for which isproperly taken by them.    He does not therefore accept that EMAs should be financed from the Special Unemployment Programme.6. Since it is, in our view, essential that a scheme of educationalMaintenance allowances should be introduced in September 1979, we have drawn up the alternative more limited local option scheme set out in the annex which would require a lower level of resources to be transferred fromthe additional provision for employment.    With this scheme it would be opento us to review progress after one or two years to decide whether or at whatpoint a mandatory scheme should then be introduced.HEALTH AND SOCIAL SECURITYIf these proposals are agreed, we recommend that the whole of thehalance available after the decisions by Cabinet on 17 October, amountingto  57 million, should be used to help meet urgent needs in the fields of social security and health.8* On the social security side, the minimum requirement is  12 million for 1979-80 to give the long-term rate of supplementary benefit to thoseunemployed who have been on supplementary benefit for two years. Theyare the only group denied this higher rate of benefit and this discriminationshould be removed as part of our measures to help the long-term unemployed.This would leave  45 million   (United Kingdom) for health and personal social services which, in England, would allow growth of 2 per cent for 
1979- 80 - well below the bid of 3 per cent.    It would give very little scope for improvements in the health service at a time when there are urgent and compelling calls.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury is opposed to theproposed increase for the long-term unemployed.    If his view were toprevail against the wishes of Department of Health and Social ServicesMinisters then we propose that the whole  57 million should be allocated to the healtii and personal social services.    That would provide   for growthat 2.1 per cent and show that the National Health Service was beingaccorded a modest priority.9. The first call on whatever additional resources are made availablefor health and personal social services must be for the necessary provisionfor estimating changes in the demand-led health services.    At theappropriate time the Secretary of State for Social Services will wish to pursue his case for a higher rate of growth for the National Health service in later years.1980- 8110. For 1980-81 these proposals will entail consequential additions to ourprogrammes (some inescapable, the rest highly desirable) for health and social security and, to the extent that they are not coveied by savings for education, including school meals, and for the arts and science as well.However there is some scope for adjustment in the implementation of certain additional bids.    We propose that the details should be settled in consultationwith the Chief Secretary, Treasury.CONCLUSIONSH.       We propose that:-i.       if the charge for school meals has to be raised, the increase should be 3p or 5p in September 1979, the cost in 1979-80 beingmet as described in paragraph 3;ii.       a scheme for EMAs should be introduced in September 1979,the cost being met as described in paragraph 4 or 6;iii. other additional bids for education, arts and science in1979-80 should be met from the remaining tsaviugs identified in cp(78) 102;iv.   57 million should be added to the health and social securityprogrammes in 1979-80; andv.       the consequential additions in 1980-81 should be dealt withas described in paragraph 10.SWDEdepartment of Education and Science BMJM23 October 1978 SO3
(confidential)ANNEXFINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR 16-18 YEAR OLDS IN FULL-TIME EDUCATION:LIMITED SCHEMELocal education authorities in England and Wales would beempowered from September 1979 to introduce in their areas ascheme of the kind outlined in CP(78)70, but that for thepresent they should not be obliged to do so.   The main features of the scheme, which would apply to 16 year olds only in thefirst year an authority operated it, to the succeeding 16 plusgroup in the second year as well as those 17 year olds in thefirst cohort who remained in full-time education, and so on,would be:-i.   a maximum rate of grant of  7.50 per week;ii.   defined means testing arrangements based on an incomeassessment similar to that used for free school meals,with a cut-off point somewhat below the median income of families with children aged 16-18;iii.   no distinction between courses;iv.   payments to be made to parents;v.   90% specific grant on awards expenditure only.2.   Those authorities electing to operate the scheme would be obliged to apply it to all those eligible in their areas.This would both be equitable as amongst young people within each authority and would provide a basis for the introductionQf the mandatory scheme at some future date. Legislation,whose drafting is well advanced, would be needed to establish he scheme (the details of which would be set out inRegulations) and provide for the payment of specific grant tolocal authorities.3*   The cost of the scheme would depend both on the extranumbers who decided to stay on in education and on the numberQf local authorities who decided to introduce it.   There isno reason to change the view in CP(78)70 that if introduced on* national basis a scheme of this kind could hope to attract50,000 extra participants when in full operation;    the limitedscheme now proposed would attract a reduced number in proportion to the number of authorities who took part.   If the resulting participa&amp;bk were 25% in year 1, and a further 10%ln each year thereafter, the pattern of expenditure would runas in the table below.   The original run of capitalexpenditure has been replaced by an emergency programme of8toall projects in year 1, subsequent needs being met from theexpanded capital programme for further education in the main-1-(confidential)
