&quot;ttS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 10112 October 1978COMPENSATION FOR SHORT-TIME WORKING SCHEME and possible ALTERNATIVE EMPLOYMENT measures memorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and science and Paymaster general. Last April the Government published a consultative document on ascheme for compensation for short-time working.    At their meeting on6 July the Cabinet agreed (CM(78) 25th Conclusions, Minute 4) that they wished to give priority to the scheme within the headroom for additional expenditure in 1979-80.    The necessary legislation ranks as a priority item in the programme for the next Session.    This memorandum sets out therecommendations of the Ministerial Group on Unemployment Amongst young people (GEN 27) on the next steps, in the light of the outcome of the consultations.2. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) strongly support the proposals andwould welcome early introduction of a Bill.    The Confederation of BritishIndustry (CBI), whilst recognising the need to replace TemporaryEmployment Subsidy, are strongly opposed to early legislation.    They view the scheme as exclusively concerned with raising compensation to workers and oppose the use of collective funding by employers of half the cost.They consider it would impose an unfair burden on industries where therewas little short-time working.    They object to the short period of consultation and the idea of any further employment legislation.    It is clear that a Billearly next Session would be contentious and difficult to carry.    It wouldalso need much amendment in Committee because there would not be timefor all the drafting problems to be cleared up before the Bill&apos;8 introduction.3. GEN 27 nevertheless fully support the Secretary of State for employment in his view that there is a very strong case for replacing thepresent complex arrangements for supporting short-time work.    They havealso endorsed his recommendation that introduction of the Bill should be deferred until later in the Session.    This would allow time for furthertripartite discussions with the TUC and the CBI and for improving the bill which should help to make its passage less contentious.COPY NOCABINET1
4. If Cabinet endorse this deferral it would however mean that thescheme would operate from 1 April 1980 and not 1 April 1979.    This in turnwould mean that, unless alternative employment measures were operated,there would be a considerable falling off in the total employment effect ofGovernment measures in 1979-80 - it was earlier estimated that thestatutory short-time scheme would reduce unemployment by about 150, 000in that period though a more recent estimate puts this at 100, 000. Thiswill be in a period when there will be about 170, 000 new job seekers entering the employment market.5. GEN 27 accept that it is essential to have offsetting measures to compensate for delay in introducing a statutory short-time scheme and recommend that these measures should have the same priority for additionalfinance as Cabinet agreed earlier should be given to that scheme.    We have considered a provisional assessment by officials of the possible alternativemeasures and have agreed that the Secretary of State for employment should submit firm and costed proposals to us by December which wouldmake at least the same impact on unemployment as the statutory scheme would have done, taking as a guideline for overall cost the  230 millionearlier estimated as the cost in 1979-80 of that scheme.6. Cabinet may also wish to know that the Secretary of State for employment told us that on present forecasts the reduction in unemploymentfrom our measures by 1 April 1979 will be 240, 000.    This is less than the290,000 estimated earlier.    We have agreed with his proposal that we should consider later this month ways of reducing this shortfall, within existing resources.conclusion. I ask Cabinet to agree that -a. Introduction of a Bill for a permanent short-time workingscheme should be deferred until later in the Session with a view toits passage in time to operate a scheme from 1 April 1980;The queen s Speech should say that we intend to continue consultations with industry prior to introduction of legislation.b. Alternative measures must be operated from 1 April 1979with a view to at least making the same impact on unemployment in1979-80 as the statutory scheme would have made.c. Resources for these measures should be regarded as a priorityclaim on additional expenditure in 1979-80 at least to the level of 230 million estimated earlier as the cost of the statutory scheme had it been introduced from 1 April 1979.2
d. Consideration should be given urgently to additional measures to make good the expected shortfall in 1978-79.S w department of Education and Science12 October 19783
