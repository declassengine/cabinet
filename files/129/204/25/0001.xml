^CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 125 COPY no December 1978CABINETPAY: ACTION FOLLOWING THE TALKS WITH THETRADES UNION CONGRESSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. At a meeting on 30 November the Ministerial Committee on economic strategy, Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations (EY(P)), discussed a number of specific points arising from the talks with the Trades Union Congress (TUC).   I listthem briefly below, giving the Sub-Committee&apos;s conclusions.    (The paragraphreferences relate to the text of the published Government/TUC draft statement - of which I attach a copy for convenience).GENERAL STANCE2. The Sub-Committee agreed that the Government should firmly standby the policy and the guidelines in the White Paper &quot;Winning the BattleAgainst Inflation&quot; (Cmnd 7293).    Indeed I and other colleagues have alreadyrnade this clear in public statements, in the House of Commons and elsewhere.PRICES (paragraph 2)3. The action which would have been proposed was to strengthen thePrice Commission and review the Safeguaid Clauses.    It is arguable thatthere is a case on merits for both these steps.    But the Sub-Committee agreedthat there should be no initiative at present, preferring to wait and see howrelations with the TUC develop and whether these steps might provide a usefulNegotiating counter later.DISCRETIONARY ACTION (paragraph 7)The Government are not normally under any obligation to take thePrice consequences of a pay settlement into account, but there may be cases^here it would be appropriate to do so.    The Sub-Committee agreed that^dividual cases should be considered ad hoc;  and that we should avoid any public comment on the price consequences of settlements, whether or not welrnpose sanctions, since our vetting machinery will not be able to identify any^rect relationship between individual settlements and subsequent priceil*creases.
LOW PAY (paragraphs 8 and 9)5. The Secretary of State for Employment will be circulating separatelyto Cabinet a paper on this subject, on which EY(P) was unable to reach agreement.    The main feature of the Secretary of State&apos;s proposals - whichwas not embodied in the proposed Government/TUC agreement, althoughextensively discussed in the meetings about it - is to override the 5 per centlimit below the pay level of  60 per week by allowing an absolute increase of 3 per week as an alternative.    The majority of EY(P) opposed thisproposal, giving the following particular reasons:i. An offer of such under-pinning by the Government wouldhave to be unilateral and would buy nothing in return.ii. It would in practice be very difficult to avoid &quot;knock-on&quot;effects above the  60 limit, which would increase overall cost.iii. The real concern of most trade unionists at present is withrestoring differentials higher up the pay scale, rather than with thelow paid.iv. The proposal would offer little practical benefit in terms ofthe negotiations with water and local authority manuals and might make them more difficult.v. The TUC members of the Natioral Economic Development Council(the NEDC 6) had rejected the idea when put to them in thediscussions on the draft Joint Statement by the Government and TUC.COMPARABILITY (paragraph 10)6. This was originally envisaged as a possible way of getting the localauthority manuals (and the water authority manuals) to settle within the5 per cent policy for the current round.    It was never our intention to allownew comparability arrangements to be brought into operation during thecurrent pay round.    We had in mind a forward commitment against futurepay policy, subject to conditions on the following lines:-a. The settlement in the current pay round must be fairly andsquarely within the White Paper guidelines.b. Comparable earnings for comparable work must be genuinelyassessed and strictly applied.    There could be no index-linking.c. As with existing comparability settlements, payments under any new scheme might have to be staged.2
7. There have been clear indications that, at least for the present,this does not appeal to the local authority and water manual unions. Butas the negotiations develop there could just possibly come a point at which both sides of the negotiating table would find it more attractive;  and in that event offering a comparability exercise in return for a guidelines settlementnow might for the Government be a price worth paying.8. The Sub-Committee therefore concluded tha* we should keep thecomparability card in reserve in case we need it.    We should not go out ofour way to offer it now;   equally, we should not explicitly rule it out. Ifasked, we could say that the Government have an open mind on thepossibility of extending comparability and, if employers and unions inparticular public service negotiating groups wish it, we would be preparedto examine on its merits any proposal relating to comparable pay foe comparable work.    It would, of course, be essential to insist on conditions on the lines of paragraph 6 above.FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH THE TUC (paragraphs 11 and 12)9. The Sub-Committee regarded the idea of monthly dvicussions as a valuable feature of the proposed agreement.    There is now no formalcommitment, nor do we need one.    As soon as the dust has settled bothsides will want to talk again.    There is no point in trying to resurrect any sort of formal general agreement;  but it could be valuable to talk about thecurrent economic situation with particular reference to the pay scene,especially if there are difficult negotiations in progress where the TUC maybe able to use their good offices.    The first chance of starting this processmay arise from the General Council&apos;s suggestions on 22 November that theEconomic Committee should meet Ministers this month.10. The statement also refers to annual discussion of the whole range of social and economic matters which are the common concern of theGovernment and the TUC, including a common understanding of theprospects for pay  and prices.      We said in paragraph 9 of &quot;Winning the battle Against Inflation&quot; that in the Government&apos;s view &quot;the country should aim at a long-term approach in which collective bargaining is based eachyear on a broad agreement between Government, unions and employers aboutthe maximum level of earnings which is compatible with keeping inflationunder control in the following 12 months&quot;.    We shall need to consider in due course the possible arrangements for such an annual consensus, and how wecan best relate annual discussions with the TUC to the wider discussions.CONTRACT CLAUSES11. This was not a part of the Government/TUC discussions but anincidental point raised by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) in response, relating to the application of the pay clauses in government contracts and the possibility of arbitration proceedings of some sort. There3
was a fair degree of commitment on our side, not conditional on theconclusion of the agreement with the TUC.    The Secretary of State for prices and Consumer Protection has made airangements to hold discussions with the CBI, but neither side is at present aiming for very early results.CONCLUSION.12.        I invite colleagues to endorse the points agreed by EY(P). Theone unresolved issue - low pay (paragraph 5 above) - will be for discussion on the separate paper b/ the Secretary of State for Employment.D W treasury Chambers4 December 19784
tANNEXSTATEMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE TUCCOLLECTIVE BARGAINING, COSTS AND prices&quot;     The Government and the TUC agree that the fundamentalobjective of economic policy in 1978-79 is to keep the annual rate of inflation at not-more than the present level, and indeedto bring it down further, as a contribution to their aim to^duce unemployment, promote growth and improve real living standards.     Policies affecting costs, incomes, investment, theexchange rate and fiscal and monetary developments must be related to this objective.a-     The Government, in consultation with the TUC and the CBI,*ill strengthen the Price Commission, review the safeguard clauseswith the aim of extending the discretion of the Price Commission,and secure the maximum practicable interval between price increases.The TUC believes that there is a legitimate function for the price commission in examining all elements of proposed price increases,deluding raw material, labour and capital costs, without dis-e^imination between the production and distribution stages; andthat, as indicated in the TUC guidance attached, employers shouldSive public commitments on prices as part of collective agreements.3-     The Government and the TUC agree that negotiators should focus0n the need to secure the maximum efficiency in the use of resources and the containment of unit costs.     This will help ensure that the agreed inflation objective is attained, at the same time improvingeompetitiveness, increasing job security, enabling expansion of investment and employment, and providing the basis for higherliving standards for workpeople, including reductions in working hours.     For these purposes negotiators must have regard to theneed to produce a balanced allocation of benefits between workers,^vestment and consumers.
^.     The TUC will continue to play its part in the industrialstrategy with the aim of securing major improvements in the wayindustrial assets are used.     The TUC will continue to givemaximum publicity and encouragement on the industrial strategy toits members.5. The Government reaffirms its position as stated in the white paper &quot;Winning the Battle Against Inflation&quot; including themaximum level of settlements consistent with the agreed objective and discretionary action, where necessary, to support it.6. The TUC remains committed to voluntary collective bargaining,and believes ithat adherence to its guidance to negotiators, as setout in the attached Annex, will result in settlements consistent with the agreed objectives set out in paragraph 1.     It also believes that the threat or the use of sanctions in these circumstances is neither necessary nor desirable.7. Consideration has been given to the TUC guidance and to thespecial problems of low pay and certain public services. TheGovernment welcomes the emphasis in the TUC guidance to negotiatorsQn the price consequences of individual settlements. in considering discretionary action the Government will take intoaccount the price consequences of that settlement as one relevantfactor.8. On low pay, a major objective is to ensure that workersdeceive the appropriate terms and conditions of employment, whichwill involve continued use of the Fair Wages Resolution and schedule 11 of the Employment Protection Act.- 2 -i  
9. The Government will arrange an urgent examination of theexisting arrangements - both legislative and administrative -governing wages councils to ensure that there are effective meansof carrying out the dual role of improving low pay and encouraging the development of normal collective bargaining in these industries,including the publication of annual reviews of progress towardsthese objectives.     The examination will also cover ways of facilitating the transformation of wages councils into statutoryJoint industrial councils as envisaged in Section 90 of theEmployment Protection Act^and methods of ensuring that wages councils take full account of low pay objectives appropriate tothem.     The Government will meanwhile draw these considerations tothe notice of wages councils.     Ways in which the servicingarrangements of wages councils can be improved will be a subject for a separate examination.10. The Government and the TUC believe that in some areas of thePublic sector, other than those engaged in&apos;trading, there is aheater role for comparability in determining pay.     The preciseareas and methods will be a matter for negotiation between theemployers and unions concerned, but the guiding principle should bethe achievement of comparable earnings for comparable work. TheGovernment and the TUC recognise- that the establishment of levels of Pay by such methods does not provide any automatic basis for^creases for groups not part of the exercise.     Where these general principles have been appropriately observed the Governmentwill be prepared to see settlements implemented subject toaEreement on staging.^*    Progress towards the agreed objectives and any action which from time to time be needed will be discussed at monthlyStings between Ministers and representatives of the TUC, which^ill cover all relevant economic issues.
12.    For the future, the Government and the TUC will make arrangements for annual discussion of the whole range of social and economic matters which are their common concern, including a common understanding on the prospects for pay and prices.1*4 November 1978
