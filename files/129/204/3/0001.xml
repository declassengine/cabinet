^ DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 10313 October 1978CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND EMPLOYMENTMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury. When Cabinet discussed public expenditure in July(CM(78) 25th Conclusions, Minute 4) a request was made for an analysis ofthe employment consequences of public expenditure programmes and ofoptions under consideration.    Attached is a note prepared by an inter-departmental group of officials in response to this request.2. In circulating the note I must tell colleagues that I have reservations about its usefulness in relation to the decisions now before us.3. As the note explains, the question is complex.    Changes in public expenditure affect many things besides employment.    Of critical importanceat the moment are their effects on inflation.4. The analysis in the note is concerned with estimating the effects of marginal changes to programmes within an agreed overall total. the assumptions behind such estimates involve dubious hypotheses, but arecrucial to the result.    These figures leave out of account consequentialeffects on monetary conditions or on confidence.    This limitation is crucial.Any adverse effects on interest rates and confidence could eliminate themore direct effects of additional expenditure on employment.5. Within the confines of its assumptions, the analysis gives the following general picture.    The short-time working scheme, and expenditure on publicservice employment, have the largest effects on employment per pound spent.They are less advantageous in other respects.    Expenditure on publicservice employment leads to a larger increase in prices than other types ofexpenditure.    The short-time working scheme has little price effect, but does not increase output and living standards.    At the other end of the range,consumer subsidies score well in terms of prices, but have only an averageeffect on employment.    Procurement and investment expenditure fallsomewhere between public service employment and consumer subsidies in1COPY NO
their effects both on employment and on prices.    Transfers to persons(other than child benefits) have the least benefLci al effect on employment;on prices their effect is average.6. The note concludes that it is not possible to make a clear-cut analysis of the employment consequences of changes in public expenditure programmes.In particular, the inflationary dimension greatly complicates the picture.The analysis in the attached note is thus of limited value in taking our currentdecisions.J treasury Chambers13 October 19782
CONFIDENTIALPUBLIC EXPENDITURE:    EMPLOYMENT IMPLICATIONSAt the Cabinet discussions on 6 July reference was made to the neefl for&apos;an analysis of the employment consequences of the public expenditure programmes and the options under consideration by the Cabinet. this note attempts an analysis, but it must be stressed at the outset thatsuch an exercise is extremely difficult.    Chances in public expenditureaffect many things besides employment, and these effects vary considerablyover time.    In the present context the possible effects on the rate of inflation are of crucial importance.   The exercise is directed atestimating the effects of marginal changes to programmes within an agreedoverall total.   This means that no account is taken of the sort ofrepercussions on confidence and monetary conditions that could arise ifadditions to the total planned expenditure were envisaged.EXISTING PROGRAMMES2. The manpower employed in central and local government under existing programmes was summarised in Annex 13 of the Public Expenditure SurveyReport.   The summary table is attached to this paper as Appendix A.^resent programmes employ directly some 44 million people, divided between the Civil Service (i million), the National Health Service(1 million), the Armed Forces (0.3 million) and the local authorities(nearly 2-J- million).     These figures do not include the indirect effectQf public spending on employment elsewhere in the economy.   This couldnot be calculated, given the near impossibility of judging the level ofemployment which would occur if the programmes did not exist.ADDITIONS TO PROGRAMMES3. The additional bids under consideration by the Cabinet wouldin some cases provide extra public service employment.   But whetherthey do that or not, they v/ould also affect employment elsewhere.It is the total effect which needs to be taken into account in thePresent exercise.The remainder of this paper therefore provides information about: -(i)   what proportion of the main additional bids wouldbe spent on public service employment and on theother main categories of expenditure (procurement,investment, transfers, etc.)
CONFIDENTIAL(ii) what effect expenditure in these categories is likelyto have on employment - and also on output, prices and the public sector borrowing requirement. jjThe additional bids5. The table in Appendix B analyses the main additional bidsinto the relevant general categories of expenditure.   The bidswhich consist mainly of expenditure on   public service employ-ffient are those for extra current expenditure on the health serviceand on local authority services (further education, personal social services, and local environmental services).   Another group ofbids consists mainly of procurement - defence, coal and cokestocks, school non-teaching costs and family practitioner services.A further group consists mainly of construction - local authority housing and other investment, universities, hospitals and regionalwater authorities.   Quite a number of the bids cannot be whollyallocated to the usual categories of expenditure, and therefore appearas &quot;other&quot;.   This does not mean that they have no employment effects,rather that these effects cannot readily be estimated on a comparable&quot;basis. ffects on employment and the economy6. Appendix C provides estimates of the total employment effect(direct and indirect) of increases in the relevant categories ofexpenditure, and of the short-time working scheme, whose effectsdiffer significantly from those of the other general categories.(The estimates are intended to be symmetrical: decreases in expenditurehave similar effects in the opposite direction.)  It also providesestimates of the effects on output, prices and the public sector&quot;borrowing requirement.    In practice there may be other considerations(e.g. resource allocation) that one would want to take into account.The estimated effects are for a typical type of expenditure in eachcategory.    Specific bids may have peculiar features which make thematypical.7. Inevitably, there is a considerable margin of error in anysuch figures.   They are more reliable as a guide to the relativeaffects of different kinds of expenditure   than to the absoluteeffects of any one of them.   No allowance is made for shortfall0r for delays in implementing the additional bids; these generallytend to be greater for expenditure on goods and services than for transfer payments.2PrWTPTTYPMTT A T
8*     The effects of expenditure changes depend on the monetary and exchange rate policies being pursued.   Assumptions therefore haveto &quot;be made about these.   Since the present exercise is directed at estimating the effects of marginal changes to programmes within811 agreed overall total, it was assumed that there was an &quot;accommodating&apos;monetary policy, in which the monetary targets are adjusted so as to finance the increase in money national income.   The exchange rate*as assumed to be floating.   On these assumptions, increases in expenditure push the exchange rate down, partly by tending to raiseSports and partly through their effects on short-term capital flows.^&quot;is in turn stimulates more domestic output, so that employmentincreases more than if the exchange rate were fixed, but prices alsoincrease more.   Further details about the assumptions are given inAppendix C.   Different assumptions would be appropriate in different circumstances and would produce different results.    If, for example,additions to the total of planned expenditure were envisaged itvould probably not be appropriate to assume an accommodating monetary^iicy.   In these, and perhaps some other, circumstances it might also be necessary to consider possible adverse effects on confidence.Sanmary of resultsThe table in Appendix C gives the effects on employment, output,Prices and the PSBR of a permanent increase of  400 million in theievel of expenditure in each category.   There is no significancein this figure of  400 million.       It is not related to the amountQf headroom.    It was chosen simply as the smallest unit ( 100 million a quarter) which would avoid cluttering the table with an unduedumber of decimal places.&quot;to.     As the effects vary considerably over time, the estimates areSiven over a 5-year period.    Generally, the differences between theeffects of different types of expenditure on employment tend to diminish as time goes by ; but their differing effects on prices tend^o become more marked.11 * The general picture can be summarised as follows. The short-timeJtggking scheme and expenditure on public service      employmcnt,havelargest effects on employment per pound spent.   But they are**8s advantageous in other respects.   Expenditure on publicservice      employment leads to a larger increase in prices than3
other measures for a number of reasons, including its effect on theexchange rate, and its effect on earnings, both through thetightening of the labour market and because, unlike consumersubsidies, it does nothing to lessen pressures for pay increases.The short-time working scheme has very little price effect, but,being merely a means of sharing work, it does not increase output and living standards.12     The other kind of expenditure which scores well in terms ofprices, consumer subsidies, has an average effect on employment.Procurement and investment expenditure fall somewhere between public service employment and consumer subsidies, in their effectsboth on employment and on prices.     Transfers to persons (other thanchild benefits, which have similar effects to income tax reductions)nave the least beneficial effect on employment and an average effecton prices.13. As regards the public sector borrowing requirement, in theearly years expenditure on public service employment and the short-time working scheme has a lower PSBR cost than the other categories.   By year 5, the pattern, however, is different. Theincrease in PSBR as a proportion of GDP is lower for the other categories than it is for public service employment, because ofthe favourable effects of a higher level of activity and lower priceConclusion14. It is not possible to make&apos; a clear-cut analysis of theemployment consequences of changes in public expenditure programmes.In particular, the inflationary dimension greatly complicates the picture.   The estimates in Annex C of the broad orders of magnitude of the employment and other effects of the various bids dependcritically on the particular set of assumptions summarised inParagraph 8 above.   The effects could be significantly differenton different assumptions.   Moreover, special factors may cause theeffect on employment of particular additional bids to be greater orless than is suggested by the estimates for broad economic categoriedescribed above.   Thus the estimates shown in Annex C should betreated with considerable caution.
APPENDIX APublic Service ManpowerExtract from Annex 13 of 1978 PESC ReportPublic service manpower implied by survey baseline1. Table 1 summarises the detailed manpower estimates in tables2 to 5 for the civil service, the health service, the armed forces andlocal authorities. The figures are for the most part in terms of whole-time equivalents, and the projections are broadly consistent with the baseline expenditure estimates.2. The broad picture which emerges is of public service employ-ment increasing by about 1  per cent from present levels to 1981and then decreasing slightly to 1983. About half the expected increase is in the health service and half in local authorities. How-ever, due to the greater size of the local authorities, it amounts to2J per cent in the former case and only 1J per cent in the latter.3. It should be noted that the figures are not comprehensive, nor do they correspond precisely with the estimates of wages and salariesincorporated in the baseline expenditure figures, because they refer to 1 April and not to annual averages, and for other reasons; inparticular they exclude most public service employees in NorthernIreland. -Public service manpower projections summary .TABLE 1                                                                                                                          At 1 ArrU (thousands)1976 -   1977 1978 1979 1980 1981 1982 1983Qviltcivice.....                                           748 746 736 739 741          741 738 740J^iiotul Health Scrvkx      ...       961 969 989 991 1,000 1,015 1,017 1,018J^*l forces.....                                         337 330 322 323 324         324 324 323*uthorities.....                                   2,362 2,350 2,343 2,368 2,370 2,378 2,367 2,348Total of above &apos;    .      .      .     4.408       4.395       4.391        4,421       4.436       4.458       4.446 4.429

NOTES1* The MOD proposals for additional expenditure represent the cost of current defence policy. The figures indicate a possible breakdown of the cuts which might need to heroade, and consequently serve as a guide to the existing employment that would be lost,** the proposals were rejected.In accordance with the National Accounts conventions, defence procurement coversexpenditure of a capital nature including expenditure on equipment for the forces.expenditure with the industries concerned by other Government departments v/ould beclassified in this table as investment.5*   The ODM proposal for additional expenditure would be classified as net lending&amp;nd transfers overseas.     The Department however estimates that it would have thesame economic effects as domestic expenditure split into the following categories:Public service employment 8%, procurement 30%, central government transfers overseaseft.     These percentages are based on an assessment of the breakdown of aid expend-1 Ure in 1977-78, because the additional bid is for a general increase in theProgramme as a whole.* The items classified as &quot;other&quot; fall into the following economic categories:Future industrial support      -      transfers to companies.Scottish Development Agency   -       transfer to a public coporation.Mortgage lending -       net lending to personsUniversities -       transfers to private non-profitmakingbodies.Local environmental services,urban programme, awards forl6-l8 year olds, school building improvements,expansion of day release,hospital and community health, and personal social services -   &apos;  investment in land and existing buildings.Percentage figures averaged over survey period.^&apos; Percentage figures represent provisional breakdown.* Elding down the charge for school meals.     This has much the same effect as a^bsidy.,&apos; In addition, this expenditure would reduce unemployment and the labour forcekeeping more 16-18 year olds in full-time education.

Notes to table on the Economic Effects of Changes in Public Expenditure^he table summarises the results of simulations on the Treasuryttacroeconomic model of the effects over a five year period of increases in seven types of public expenditure, as follows:-(1) General Government Expenditure on Public Service Employment(2) General Government Construction Investment(3)General Government Investment in Plant, Machinery and VehiclesGeneral Government Expenditure on Procurement of CurrentGoods and Services(5)General Subsidy to Consumer Goods and Services(6)Central Government Transfers to Persons, other than ChildBenefit(?)Expenditure on the Short-Time Working Scheme2-     In each case the ex ante increase in expenditure was heldinstant at  100m a quarter in 1978 Survey prices throughoutfive year period.   There is no significance in the figure of 100m.    It was chosen simply as the smallest unit which would avoidcluttering the table with an undue number of decimal places. Thef*Ll change was assumed to take effect at the beginning of the first*ear, although in practice there is a gradual build-up in new expenditure items.   No shortfall was allowed for.
3.     The increases in expenditure were assumed to be financedhy additional central government borrowing.   No increases in rates or National Insurance contributions, such as might occur inpractice when local authority expenditure or National insurance benefits, respectively, are increased, were normally assumed.However, expenditure on the short time working scheme was treated rather differently.    Gross expenditure was defined as allPayments of compensation for short time working to individual companies, minus the reduction in payments by the government tothe redundancy fund.   Some of this gross expenditure is effectivelymet by employers&apos; contributions to the short time working fund.It was assumed that monetary targets would be adjusted to finance the increase in money national income which occurs in thesimulations.   More precisely it was assumed that real interest rates would be more or less the same as in the absence of the changes.   Since prices and hence price expectations rise in mostof the simulations, nominal interest rates rise slightly.    It isffiore realistic to assume that monetary policy accommodates an^crease in expenditure which is sustained over five years, thanthat monetary targets are unchanged so that interest rates havetc rise to sell gilts, and some private expenditure is therebycrowded out.5-     The exchange rate was assumed to be floating; more formally,l* adjusted in the simulations to clear the foreign exchangeMarket without any change in official financing.   Over a period aslong as five years it is realistic to assume that the exchange rate will be determined essentially by market forces.^*     Other assumptions were:(a) specific duties, personal income tax allowances and higher bands were indexed in line with the concurrentincrease in the RPI;(b) earnings responded to changes in prices, the ratio of post-tax earnings to gross earnings, and the level andchange in unemployment;(c) no allowance was made for any possible effects of changes in expenditure on incentives, efficiency,or productivity.
