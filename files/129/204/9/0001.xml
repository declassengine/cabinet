)QCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 109 COPY NO23 October 1978CABINETFIRST REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEEON PROCEDURE, SESSION 1977-78Note by the Secretary of the Cabinet** The Prime Minister directed that the Procedure Committee&apos;s report,published on 3 August, should be considered initially by the official committee on Parliamentary Procedure (PPO) with a view to offering advice to Ministers before the start of the new Session.    I attach a copy of PPO&apos;sReport which, together with its appendix, is inevitably long.    Many of theProcedure Committee&apos;s recommendations are relatively detailed and can beconsidered by the appropriate Ministers separately.    The Prime Ministerftas however instructed me to include the PPO Report on the Cabinet&apos;s agendaso that the Cabinet may consider:-a. the handling of the Government&apos;6 response to the ProcedureCommittee&apos;s Report.    Paragraphs 5 to 9 of the PPO Reportrecommend a &apos;take note&apos; debate in the House of Commons in whichthe Government would indicate their views to whatever extentseemed desirable;b. their attitude to the Procedure Committee&apos;s proposals for a comprehensive system of select committees, with broad terms ofreference, to cover the responsibilities of all GovernmentDepartments and the nationalised industries.    Paragraphs 14 to 25of the PPO Report draws attention to the extent to which the sub-committees of the Expenditure Committee have already ranged widelyover non-expenditure policy issues and, against that background, tothe possible implications of the proposed new system.    They alsodiscuss the important recommendations on the powers and staffingof select committees.2* Permanent Secretaries asked for an opportunity to discuss the PPO^eport before it was submitted to Ministers and I chaired a meetingAccordingly.    Not surprisingly on a matter of this kind, their views were notUnanimous.    Nevertheless there was a strong consensus on the followingPoints:-a.    The PPO Report fairly sets out the main arguments but in adeliberately neutral tone.    The question of a further development ofthe Select Committee system is essentially a matter of politicaljudgment.    There are no decisive administrative considerations involved.1
b. A majority of Permanent Secretaries would personally favourgoing along with the proposed system of Departmental select committees.    A minority was apprehensive on broad constitutionalgrounds.c. They felt however that Ministers should have their attentionspecifically drawn to three points:-i.     The new system would be likely to increase the need for ministers to appear before Select Committees and could marka shift of emphasis away from the floor of the House.ii.     While initially the new system might not mark a sea-change from the wide-ranging activities of the expenditure committee, much would obviously depend on the extent towhich the supporting staffs of Select Committees were built upsubsequently.    This would be a matter for the new House ofCommons Commission.iii.     If the Select Committee system is substantially widenedand deepened, there may be a need to look again at the conventionsgoverning the basis on which officials give evidence - both on thetreatment of confidential matters and on discussion of the merits of policies where a need for frankness would have to be combined with the protection of Ministerial responsibility.d.    Permanent Secretaries were unanimous in favouring the retentionof the Select Committee on the important for the reasons given inparagraph 25 of the PPO Report.The Cabinet are invited to consider:-a. how the initial Government response to the ProcedureCommittee recommendations should be handled; and b. whether any Government view should be expressed initially onthe proposed new structure of select committees and on their powers and staffing.Signed    JOHN hunt cabinet Office23 October 19782
IRESTKIC i tzU)(xOVSBNMSNT RB5PGNS3 TO REPORT 0? SZLICTCOMMITTEE Oil procedure. when the House resumes there is likely to be early and growing pressure for a G-government reaction to the major First Report from the Select Committeeon Procedure, Session 1977-7S.2. The report makes a number of detailed proposals for procedural changesin matters such as Public Bill procedure and the consideration of statutory instruments, but its most important recommendations relate to the proposedestablishment of a comprehensive structure of Departmental select committees.Essentially, however, it is a conservative report which puts forward its proposals for procedural change within the context of the existing Farliamentarrelationship between the Executive and the Legislature, for example withregard to the G-overnment1 s control over the order of business and financialinitiative.3. The report does not touch upon any wider constitutional issues thatmight be related to procedure, such as the role of pre-legislation committees,links with the European Parliament, the sise and membership of the House, or thirole of a Second Chamber.   7/hilst it was originally envisaged that a fundamentalreview of Parliamentary procedure might take account of some of these more general constitutional issues, it now seems likely that 2,iinisters will be content to deal with the report at the secondary level taken by the ProcedureCommittee.L.     The detailed&apos; recommendations made in the report are summarised at appendix I, together with brief indications of the line Ministers might be advised to take.     The following paragraphs deal with seme of the more general issues raised by the report.ESHERAI HANDLING-5.     The G-ovemment1 s initial response might take one of the followingforms:(restricted)
(restricted )i. the publication of a White or Green Paper outlining the Government&apos;views on the Connittee1 s proposals, followed by a debate in the House;ii. a debate, not preceded by a White or Green paper, in which theCommittee&apos;s proposals, or modifications proposed by the Government, wouldbe tabled for decision by the House; oriii. a &apos;take note&apos; debate on the report.   Some statement of the-Government1s position would need to be made during its course, but how firmit would need to be would be a matter of judgement; whatever indicationswere given, the government&apos;s final position would ho doubt be reserved until Ministers had been able to consider the views expressed by the House.A further, substantive, debate would then be needed, perhaps following thepublication of a Government Paper.6. TThich of these courses Ministers TmMl vrish to &quot;follow will no doubtdepend on the overall Parliamentary situation at the time end their gene-2-view of the desirability or othervrise of the principal changes, especial^?the new select committee system proposed in the report.   But the follow!^comments are relevant.-7. It has not been the general practice in recent years for Governmentsrespond to reports of Procedure Committees by means of a White or green paper, although a Green Paper T?as published by the Conservative acminiin 1970 in response to the then Procedure Commit tee&apos;s proposals fortransforming the former Estimates Committee into a Select Committee on expenditure.     A decision not to publish a response in advance cf a deb&amp;&quot;&apos;could be justified on the basis that the report vras made to Parliament,that Hinisters Trished to take account of the views cf the House as a tfh0-2before coming to conclusions.   A mere practical argument is that a detailstatement of the Government&apos;s reaction in advance vrould be likely to liS*the Government1s subsequent room for manoeuvre, and if the Government&apos;3objections to particular proposals rested essentially on the need to ret^control cf Parliamentary business, these could not be easily presented.There would therefore be a risk of increasing the likelihood that the H^u5would accept proposals which the Government considered objectionable.2(restricted)
(restricted;8*   An initial debate on substantive potions might have advantages ifI-Iinisters wished to see the CommitteeT3 main recommendations implementedas quickly as possible.   But it would run the greater risk that unv;antedrecommendations v/ould &quot;ce accepted, and Government modifications orrejection of particular proposals would need to be decided without anyprior testing of House reaction to the report.9*    A preliminary Ttake note decate could be presented as appropriatedeference to the views of the House, and v/ould enable the strength of house feeling on particular issues to be assessed before conclusions were.reached.    It would be the safest approach and possibly the one most likely to maximise the chances of eventual rejection or modification ofobjectionable proposals.    In any event there would be no need for final decisions.   Consideration could be given to the subsequent publication ofa vihite or Green paper in the light of the Hake noteT decate. the longer such a debate was delayed, however, the more pressure there v/ouldhe for the government&apos;s response to be made more explicit.HJ3LIC 3ILL FRCCZDGR2 (Reccommendations 1-14)10. These recommendations are largely separate and self-contained, anda number have been previously proposed by other committees.    Details and suggested responses are scheduled at Appendix I.    lost of therecommendations are of secondary importancet but the proposals for additionalevidence-taking &quot;sessions.&quot;.in standing committees and the need  or Ministers -and officials to defend, policy proposals^there (recommendation5) would have more far-reaching implications which Ministers would need to consider care-fully.   Taken in conjunction with a concluding nsweep up&quot; session in StandingCommittee (recommendation 6) and minimum prescribed intervals between thestages of a Bill (recommendation 8)y the-proposals would not in any case be practicable for the Finance Bill&quot;if consideration of-the Bill is to becompleted within the statutory timetable imposed by the Provisional CollectionQf Taxes Act.^SLHDATSD LZGI3L.4TIOIT (Recommendations 15-21)11. These recommendations are similarly self-contained. IHnisters&apos;. main concern is likely to be to avoid giving committees dealing withstatutory instruments powers which they could manipulate in order to^old up the Parliamentary programme on the. Floor.   Suggestions forcandling are at Appendix I.3(restricted)
(restricted)EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES IEGISIATION (Recommendations 22-30)12. The nine recommendations on European Communities legislation (lis^ein Appendix I) are &quot;being considered in the working group on legislation0&apos;the Official Committee on European Questions.   Ministers are expected *0consider them later this month in the appropriate Ministerial Group.13. The Governments response to these recommendations may be given elseparately, or as part of the Governments overall response to the Proce&quot;&apos;Committee.   The Government may wish to hear the views of the House on ^part of the Report in a Hake note&apos; debate before Christmas before rea-0^a final view.SELECT COMMITTEES - STRUCTURE, STAFFING AND POWERS (Recommendations 3^&apos;14*   The report recommends the establishment of twelve new select codud1with broad terms of reference, simply drawn (eg &quot;to consider defence&quot;) ^permissive rather than mandatory in character.   They would together co^*the responsibilities of all Government Departments and the nationalistindustries;   and they would replace the present Select Committees on expenditure, Nationalised Industries, Science and Technology, overseas development, Race Relations and Immigration, and the parliamentary commissioner for Administration.   In crude terms 16 committees, incl^^*4 recommended sub-committees, would thus replace 11, including the Su^Committees of the Expenditure   Committee.   The remainder of the House oJ*Commons select committee system, including the Public Accounts Commi^6&apos;would remain as at present.15*   In considering these proposals, &quot;Ministers will wish to take acco^of their wider political context:   on the one hand, concern about the effectiveness of Parliament, the increasing desire of back-bench mei&amp;e^to assert themselves and the general campaign for more information abo^the working of government;   and on the other, the impact of the sele0-committee system on the role of Parliament and on- the Party system.4(restricted)
(restricted)16. Ministers will also need to judge the likely effect of the proposals by comparison with the way in which the existing committee structure is working in practice and how it would be likely to develop on the present basis particularly if the Procedure Committee,s proposals are rejected.The prescribed scope of the work of the present Expenditure Committee andits sub-committees^ is linked with the expenditure aspects of the work of departments as in the operative paragraph of their orders of reference at appendix II.   Since   the great bulk of the work of spending Departments has some link with expenditure, the Sub-Committees have in practice found nodifficulty in ranging freely over Departmental policy and administration.Furthermore the orders of reference have not in practice inhibited theSub-Committees from making inquiries on many occasions into those areas ofgeneral departmental policy and administration which are only tenuouslyrelated or even wholly unrelated to any particular expenditure aspect.Examples include the inquiry of the Social Services and Employment Sub-Committee into youth unemployment, the Defence and External Affairs inquiry into the Helsinki agreement, the Environment Sub-Committeefs inquiry intoplanning procedures, the Trade and Industry Sub-CommitteeTs inquiry intothe wages and conditions of workers employed in South Africa, and alsotheir inquiry into Fisheries questions, eg conservation of fish species and fishing limits, and substantial parts of the General Sub-Committee^ inquiry into the Civil Service.   Specialist Committees, eg on Nationalised industries or Science and Technology, have of course ranged widely in the policy field.17. Against this background, there was a difference of view in PPO Committeeabout the extent to which the proposed structure of departmental committees,and in particular the widening of the orders of reference, would representa significant change, or rather a formalisation of existing   practice and afurther advance along the course on which the House of Commons had alreadyset itself and from which it was unlikely to be deflected.   This may be largely a. political judgement.   Officials&apos; views were influenced by their Departments1varying experience of the range of issues covered by Expenditure Sub-Committees and Specialist Committees under the present system.     For example,* General; Defence and External Affairs; Environment; Trade and Industry;Education, Arts and Home Office; Social Services and Employment.5
^rvc    i rviu 1  Uyin the case cf Expenditure Sub-Corrr committees, it was argued on the one hsndthat the linkage cf their orders of reference to expenditure was still a factor in restraining Sub-Coaoittees from examining T7ider policy issues or at least approaching then directly; in particular the Expenditure Commit&apos;cShas not hitherto directly tackled substantial areas of economic and fiafis6*management.   On the other hand, the experience of the spending Departmsr-&apos;-was generally that Sub-Committees had proved very ready to investigate dr*&quot;issues of Departmental policy and administration.     &quot;what is clear is that ^-introduction of a comprehensive system of departmental committees as p-0-&quot;would affect some Departments more than others and that to the extent tb**the new committees chose to concentrate on wider policy issues, as distilfrom expenditure matters, the recent tendencies in that direction would ceaccelerated and widened,  in important factor determining the impact onDepartments would be the arrangements, made to increase the&quot;supporting staff5of Select Committees&quot; (paragraphs-20 and 21&quot; below).&quot;&quot;18.. The practical implications of the Procedure Committee,s proposals may therefore be summarised as follows - .i.   If the wider scope cf enquiry and the formal severance of &quot;r*slink with expenditure increased the disposition of Select Comma-&quot;to inquire into matters of general Government policy, or to becfl*political pressure groups, arguing for particular policies, V&amp;&amp;*5would need to appear personally before Select Committees more o* *than hitherto.   This would not only make greater demands on ths**time; it could also affect their relations with Parliament more generally.     Tor the nature of the political debate in Committeedifferent from that on the floor of the House.   The proceeding5 \inquisitorial.   Ministers dc not have the initiative; the choicfltiming of business is in the hands of the Chairman rather than *&quot;TThips, and the shape of hearings, is largely determined by thecuestioners.ii.   The new Committee structure would in any case be likely -0bring scratiny to bear on major areas of Government policy, pa--&apos;m the 7.m,aer economic and monetary field, which have hitherto &quot;regarded by Ministers as particularly sensitive.   Although the(restricted)
existing conventions for safegaardin^ the confidentiality ofsensitive Government evidence have generally worked well (and theProcedure Committee have proposed no changes to then) new and clearunderstandings would probably be required, particularly in the fields of economic and monetary matters and international relations.3earing in mind that the discussion would often relate to mattersof acute topical political interest, judgments about sensitivitywould seem likely to become more frequent and difficult. ^iii. The wider scope of the new Committees would be likely to leadto greater pressure for the release of Government information, for &apos;example, details of economic projections, which Ministers havehitherto resisted.     Ministers might find themselves less free thannow to decide what and when to publish.On the other hand -iv. A comprehensive system of general committees and the demise of,inter alia, the Select Committees on the National Industries and science and Technology should free some Departments (eg Energy) fromthe considerable duplicated scrutiny which arises frcm the presentoverlapping terms of reference of existing select committees.Departmental coverage would thus be spread more evenly.v. The proposed system should enable the committees to build upexpertise and understanding of the work of their Departments, with tinconsequent benefit of better informed debate in the House and elsewhe:of departmental issues.vi. The Procedure Committee (paragraph 5*4-7) expected that unSLerthe new structure less time would be devoted in the future to thelong and intensive inquiries of the &quot;?.oyal Commission&quot; variety whichhave been favoured by many of the existing select committees and more to specific analyses of the proposals and reports of the government or of other agencies and organisations.   Although this must be largel;a matter of conjecture, some influences at least (eg the un:g^rnity7(restricted)
(restricted)of the system and the closer working relationship with Departments) mightwork in this direction.   There might also he some hope of the hest workingpractices of existing select committees, in terms of adequate notice andindication of questions to he covered, being more widely adopted.On the powers of select committees, the Procedure Committee consider thatthe overriding principle should be that the House has power to enforce theresponsibility of Ministers for the provision of information or the refusal ofinformation; and that it would not be appropriate to enforce the House&apos;s rightto secure information from the Executive at a level below that of the MinisterialHead of the Department concerned.   The most noteworthy of the Committee&apos;srecommendations (64 and 65) are that a select committee should in future havethe direct power to order the attendance of Ministers, and that a refusal by a minister to produce papers required by a select committee would inevitably leadto debate on the Floor.   Despite the fact that Ministers do in practice normallycomply with a request from a select committee to attend as a witness or toProduce papers, they may wish to resist the proposal that a select committee, as distinct from the whole House, should have the formal right to order theirattendance or to order them to produce papers.   Ministers refusing to comply*ith such orders and seeking the backing of the whole House for i:heir decisions would start from a disadvantageous position.   Moreover, if committees couldautomatically move to order a Minister to produce papers, they might be lessAlined to try to reach accommodation with Ministers on the basis of the existingconventions.   In any event, Ministers will no doubt wish to emphasise that they^tain the right to decide which particular Minister should appear before a selectcommittee.   They may also wish to try and preserve the traditional &quot;take note&quot;?orm of deoates on select committee reports which would remain non-mandatory(recommendation 44).   The report broadly endorses the interpretation of thePosition outlined in the Memorandum of Guidance for Officials appearing befores*lect Committees issued by the Civil Service Department (GET 76/78).2o-   The Procedure Committee (paragraphs 6.34-6.47) propose unspecified increases111 the supporting staff for select committees as a corollary to their proposals*0* an expanded committee structure.   If this proposal were to leadProgressively to large staff increases - as paragraphs 6.39-6.41 and 6.47 may^sage - this would be expensive.   Supporting staffs on a large scale could also^mentally alter the working of the present select committee system, its^t on apartments and its relationship to the Party system; it would in any^e be important to ensure that staff with access to sensitive information hadrestricted)
(restricted)adequate security^clearance.   Under the House of Commons (Administration) Actfuture decisions&quot; on committee staffing matters will rest- with the new House. of-CoijmTons.-Commission.- Tt will he for the Lord President, as a Government- member, to exercise-anyfrestraining influence -which. 1-fi.nisters-might look- for&quot;whether under the present select committee system or as a means of forestallingan unacceptable shift of power to select committees under the proposed new syster- 21. A departmental committee system, especially if supported by an expanded staffing structure, would clearly add to the workload of theGovernment because of the addition to the number of select committees.The increases would fall particularly at senior official level and particularlyin Departments 7/hcse activities have so far been covered only lightly byselect committee scrutiny, if at all.    The extent of the increases, and theadditional staff required, are however impossible to quantify accurately before it is known how the departmental committees and their staffing would develop.Departmental enquiries have also confirmed the difficulty of assessing theworkload caused by the existing committee structure.&apos;  This is because the bulkof select committee work falls on line divisions and is absorbed as an integral part of their regular duties.   A further difficulty in producing valid estimate is that the impact of select committee work is irregular, and it is hard toestablish a &quot;typical&quot; period.   So far as the House of Commons is concerned, itwill be primarily for the House to weigh the additional burden on its Members,taking into account the Procedure Committee1s belief that the number of Membersinvolved would not differ greatly from that under the present system (5.5 A-).22.   The balance between the various conflicting considerations in paragraphs15-21 above is essentially a political one for ministers judgment. if ministers decide that they need to oppose the Procedure Committee1s proposals,they may wish to prolong the Parliamentary discussion along the lines suggestedin paragraphs 5(iii) and 9 above, and the Government will no doubt shape their contribution to the proposed &quot;take note&quot; debate accordingly.   They may alsowish to proceed along the lines suggested in paragraph 5(iii)if they would prefthe Parliamentary and public discussion to develop before reaching final conclusions.   Alternatively, if they conclude that the considerations set cut in the foregoing paragraphs are not sufficient to justify the Government in opposing the Procedure Committee&apos;s proposals, they may see advantage in expressing their willingness to accept them in principle at the start of theParliamentary discussion and in taking the credit for doing so.9(restricted)
23.   If it can be presented that the Government are accepting, albeit wit-modifications, the broad concept of a comprehensive select committee systemthis should improve the chances of safeguarding the position with regard -0several important proposals (recommendations 44-, 45, 4-9 and 65) relating -0the organisation of the new committee system which Ministers might wish, -:possible, to resist or modify, either on grounds of the need to maintain --&quot;over the Parliamentary programme or cn more general Parliamentary grounds-24-   Acceptance in principle would not preclude Ministers from proposing t0House some reduction in the number of Committees proposed by regrcucingdeal with Departments in related functional areas (eg Transport withEnvironment or Trade with Industry), although to &quot;reduce the load on Depart&apos;&apos;it would also be necessary to propose a limit cn the number of sub-ccnmitOne way of achieving both objectives, following the precedent in 1970,to limit the number of Members serving on the Committees,perhaps to the ?r&apos;:number of 105.     More positively, such a modification could reduce overl*?between committees and encourage a more consistent approach.   Apart frcnpossible regrouping and a limit on the number of Members serving on commit&apos;it is at first sight difficult to see any middle course between the ProceHCommittee&apos;s proposals and the present system.   If as an alternative theGovernment were to propose no more than an intensification of the functi^coverage of the Expenditure Committee1 s present activities - which mightprogressively happen in any event - while retaining a full panoply of committees, that would not appear to offer any advantage.25.   If the Procedure Committee&apos;s proposals for departmental committees(including a joint sub-ccmmittee cn the nationalised industries(paragraph 5.59)), were broadly accepted, there would be no point (as &apos;r&quot;Committee recognises) in retaining any of the specialist committees on Jnationalised industries, science and technology, overseas development fl^ Jrelations and immigration.     The arguments for abolishing the Select Cj0C&apos;&apos;on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (important) and dispersir** .work throughout the departmental committees are. however, more evenly 3 ^ ..Cn the one hand, there could be advantage in retaining one committee -cat the important system as a whole as well as individual cases, on the basis 1the principles to be applied to administration are common to every Dep**It may also be relevant that, like the Public ..cccur.ts Committee, the ?Committee is assisted bv an independent office holder with staff whc ^&apos;access to department.-.! files.   On the other hand, the departmental cc--will be familiar 7m.th the wcrk of the Departments concerned as a whole10(restricted)
(restricted)and could be expected to develop an approach to questions of maladministrationthat took account of a Departments work as a whole; and it would no doubt be possible to ensure that the important staffs duties and access to files remainedstrictly confined to those questions.     The important Committee has recommended inits fourth report (1977-78) that the committee be retained and the important himselfhas expressed the same view.ROLE OF TEE C and AG- (recommendations 54 (second part), 66-63))26. These recommendations are restatements, with-&quot;some amendments, of ideaswhich were first put forward by the Expenditure Committee in their Report onthe Civil Service.   Though the subject matter looks technical, the proposalsraise very important constitutional and political issues which couldsignificantly affect the relationship between the Executive and Parliament.All the proposals would need legislation, which would open up a wide field for debate, and appear to be inspired by the  aims    of some Members firstly toextend the C and AG-1 s responsibility to the whole of the public sector (and beyond) and secondly to remove him from all executive influence and to planthim visibly and directly within the sphere of control of the House of commons and its committees.27. Recommendation 66 repeats a proposal of the Expenditure Committee in a modified form as suggested by the C and AG- in his observations on thatCommittee1 s F-eport on the Civil Service.     The proposal now is for the E andAD and District Audit to be amalgamated.     The G-government rejected theExpenditure Committee1 s proposal on the grounds, broadly, that it would breedconfusion ever local and national responsibilities and erode the independence of local authorities.   No new arguments have been advanced for departing fromthat line, but in view of the C and AG-1 s qualified support for the proposal,it is likely to be pressed hard in the House.28. A fuller note on recommendations 67 and 63 (together-with 54 (second part)) is at Appendix III.       Recommendation 67, like the equivalent recommendation of the Expenditure Committee, is aiming at   a   comprehensive statutorydefinition of the C and AG-1 s audit responsibilities which would enormously11(restricted)
(restricted )enlarge his field of operations.     The G-government rejected this proposal aSfemulated by the Expenditure Committee.   For the reasons explained inAppendix III, P?0 Committee recommend that they should maintain that pos-:-&apos;There is a chance that the Government may be able to make a stet in the Q-ito1favoured by the Select Committees if they are prepared to agree (in replyseparate PAC Report) that the C and AG- should have access to the books ^records of BNOC.   This limited proposal would not require legislation.29. Recommendation 63, and the second part of the recommendation 54 areconcerned with the relationship between the C and AG- and his staff and theExecutive and Parliament.     The Procedure Permittee follow the ExpendituresCommittee in proposing that the C. and AG-1 s staff should become &quot;servants&quot; 0^Parliament but this term is not precisely defined.   If it means that the 1appointment of and managerial authority over E and AD staff should be take0of the hands of the C and AG- it would run flatly counter to the G-overnnsirf &quot;repeated view that the C and AG- should be able to operate independently 0l&quot;direction from any outside authority - whether the Executive or Parlie^81&quot;&apos;&quot;&apos;5ut the intention of the Procedure Committee might be to transfer to the -of Commons Commission solely the existing powers of the CSD to approve tbenumbers of the C and AG-1 s staff and determine their pay and conditions 0x 1service, while leaving the staff firmly under the C and AG-1 s managerial sUand direction.     This would not raise the same or obi ems for the indeten^-2&quot;&apos;of the C and AG- and might indeed have the advantage in putting his inde?e&quot;^from the Executive beyond doubt.   Ministers might therefore wish to cons-&quot;&apos;this proposition, though attention is drawn in Appendix III to a number 0-important implications.   In particular, a change of this kind would re$***primary legislation to amend the E and AO Act 1921, which could open u^questions, not only of the C and AG-&apos; s role and status, but of the role ^ .functions of the Treasury in expenditure control and of the accountable&quot; -the Executive to Parliament more generally.     It would also mean thatstaff would no longer be members cf the Home Civil Servioe.FINANCIAL CONTROL (recommendations 69-70)30. These recommendations are procedural and technical, and are dealtAppendix I.12(restricted)
(restricted)OBGANISATIQN OF SESSIONS AND SETTINGS (recommendations 71-76)31. As &quot;with the Comi ttee&apos; s procedural recommendations, the proposals for changes in the House1 s arrangements for sessions and sitting are basicallyconservative, and the Committee have rejected proposals for any radicalreorganisation, either of the Parliamentary year or the Parliamentary day.They have, in particular, resisted pressures for morning sittings and fixedsessions.    It seems unlikely that Ministers will dissent from these conclusions.32. As regards the Committee&apos;s positive proposals, it seems likely that ministers trill wish to resist the loss of flexibility in the handling of theParliamentary programme that would result in the earlier announcement ofrecesses (recommendation 76) and, more significantly, the important proposal (71that in future an &apos;Aye! vote of 200 should be required for a 10 o1 clocksuspension motion.   This could significantly increase a Government1 s difficultyin securing necessary business after 10pm.33. The suggested abolition of recess adjournment debates (72) and of Floordebates on the Second Reading of Consolidated Eund Bills (73) would, if adopted, abolish a number of traditional &quot;opportunity to air grievances&quot;debates on the Floor valued by some back-benchers.   But, from a Governmentviewpoint, this would save Floor time and might be welcomed.SUMMARY 0? CONCLUSIONS34. The PPO Committee recommends that the initial move in the Government1 sresponse to the Procedure Committee1 s Report should be to arrange a &quot;take note&quot;debate.35. With regard to the committee&apos;s proposals for a new structure of select committees, there do not appear to be any decisive administrative considerationbut Ministers will wish to take account of the political considerationsindicated in paragraphs 16-25 above, and of the practical implications outlined in paragraph 19.     If the proposals are to be accepted they may wish toorooose some reduction in the number of committees ana some limit on the number13(restricted)
(^restricted )of LI embers serving on connittees as indicated in paragraph 24. In any event,Ministers nay wish to resist or modify the procedural innovations referred toin paragraph 23 above which could in principle apply to the present committeestructure as to the proposed new structure. They may also wish to resist theproposal that a select committee, as distinct from the House, should have the formal right to order their attendance and to order them to produce papers(paragraph 19).36.  Sinisters are invited to note the important issues raised by the ProcedureCommittee1s recommendations on audit.   On recommendation 6c (amalgamation of2 and AD and the District Audit), no new arguments have been advanced fordeparting from the line taken on the Expenditure Committee&apos;s similar p rope sal put it now has the public support of the C and AS.    On recommendation 67(extension of C and AG-1 s audit responsibilities), Ministers are advised to rejsc&apos;it, as they did the Expenditure Committee1 s proposal.

But, in theGovernment&apos;a view, the presnnren on Parliamentary time in the House of Commons would mako sucha procedure inappropriate.    The (loverumen t reuognloe the need to ensure that, whenever possible,debates on statutory instruments and prayers do not take plane on the Floor until the JointCommittee has had an opportunity to consider the instrument-concerned.    But occasions must sometimesarise when the pressure of Parliamentary business, or the need for immediate administrative action,prevent this.    Ministers will, however, do all they ean to reduce these instances to the minimum.It io regretted that, the Joint Committee has not in the past alwaya been informed when it aocmedlikely that an instrument which they had not yet considered wan to be debated by the House ofCommons at an early date.   Consideration ia being given to means of improving liaison with theJoint Committee in this regard, and It is hoped that this will assist the Committee to arrangeits business in a way which will limit the extent of thia problem.

Responsibilities and status of The C &amp; AG and E &amp; A3 staffP.ecorr.endation 67New legislation should establish the principle that the accounts of all &quot;bodies in receipt of funds voted by Parliament should be subject to elimination bythe Comptroller and Auditor General, with the proviso that the C &amp; AG mayauthorise alternative audit procedures in respect of individual bodies th whose accounts he has a right of access (paragraph 8.14).Re corrugation 68The audit staff should be regarded as servants of the House, and the costof the national audit activities should be carried on the Vote of the House,thus allowing the Commission to determine the overall scale of the auditfunction and the grades, qualifications and salaries of audit staff; inaddition, the House or its committees- should be able to request the C &amp; AGto undertake inquiries, but not to direct VHm to carry out his inquiries ina particular manner (paragraph 8.21),Recommendation 54 (second part)The Cor miss ion  /Should, establish suitable procedure for the recruitment of full-time specialist staff required by select committees (paragraph 6.41);and?&quot; should be responsible for considering requests for assistance forcommittees from the Exchequer and Audit Department (paragraph 6.44).1.    Recommendations 67 and 63 aim at a systematic enlargement of the C i A2&apos;3ambitj   68 seeks to remove the C &amp; AG and his staff altogether from theinfluence of the Executive, and to make them subject in certain, respects tocontrol and influence by the House of Commons,   Both recommendations wouldinvolve legislation.
Z.     The. ideas in recoicmendations 67 and 68 were originally aired inEleventh Report from the Expenditure Committee, Session 197^-77, though there are important changes in their latest formulation.   Extracts areannexed from the Government observations on the Expenditure committee report (Cmnd 7117) which give the Government1s views on these proposals as first put forward by the Expenditure Committee.   In brief, the Cover.-&apos;did not accept the Expenditure Committeefs suggestions, but in relation&quot;-&apos;the first of them (Expenditure Committee&apos;s Recommendation 45) acknewiedi?-that there might be merit in the interests of Parliamentary ec count abiliv&quot;in affording -the C &amp; AG greater rights of access and inspection inparticular cases.Reccmmendation 673.   &apos; Although the majority of tha. C * *G,e ewiit **s7onei.Mii^&apos;iw! er?statutorily determined there is no single comprehensive definition of &apos;&quot;- responsibilities in the statutes.   The E &amp; AD Acts require him to auditdepartmental appropriation accounts, and also all stock, store and tradis?accounts.   The same Acts define his role in relation to the accounts of receipts of revenue.   Elsewhere in the public sector the position is ncr^-governed by separate statute.   The founding statutes of most nationalise-industries and public corporations normally prescribe commercial audit.Local authorities have a choice between district audit and commercialFor other public bodies created by legislation it is normal practice for&apos;- \legislation to specify the audit arrangements, and it is also normal prac* ?for the audit responsibility to be assigned to the C &amp; AG except where &amp; Ifunctions of the body in question are primarily commercial in nature.  - other features of present arrangements are relevant to the Select Cocsi*&apos;*: \&quot; proposal. The first is the Treasury^ long*-stop power under Section 3 c:&apos; *1921 Act to direct the C &amp; AG to audit- the accounts of any quasi-public ::&apos; for which no statutory audit regime exists. The second^ is the long star-&apos; ^rule enshrined in Government Accounting which ensures that where an outs-:&apos;body is grant-aided or otherwise financially supported in any signified&apos; \degree by public funds the C &amp;. AG is afforded appropriate rights of z.z.zte-: ^- and inspection (and in some cases may audit the accounts). Arrangenen&apos;-&apos; ^this sort are usually negotiated administratively, as a condition of VGovernment support. N
The main purport^ of the reconraw^ion 1* to replace       abo^e r-rth^r hs.r--^card lere.1 frsnHorfe of the C fi .VT&apos;.s oriwtiend with an across boari. atatntory?c.:er for hio to examine &quot;the accounts of all &quot;bodies in receipt of funds votedParliament&quot;.   The Committee Ocoerffi (in 8.1d of their report) the roi^t madethe Gcrornnent in replr\to the eleventh Renort of the Expenditure Ccrmitt*fcet it would be impracticable for the C &amp; AG, at any rate with his presenttesosrees, to take over at a strode the audit of accounts of, for example, allnationalised industries.   Their solution is to allow the C &amp; AG to authoriseUternative audit procedures in respect of individual bodies to whose accountsft- has a right of access&quot;.   What the proposal seems to mean is that the C ib ACsstatutory duties and powers of audit would be extended to important areas of theP^lic sector from which at oresent he is excluded.   (3y virtue of S.2S of the186o S k AD Act the C ft WMn power of audit carries rights- of access with it^erratically.)   It would be up to the C &amp; AG to decide hew far in practice toZeroise his wider powers of audit, but where he decided net to exercise them*his would be on the basis that he retained rirrhts of access.      He would be covered to &quot;authorise alternative audit procedures&quot; over a wide range of theWic and private sectors.   The Treasury, and the Executive as a whole, would,/ :sase to have any role in determining1 the scope of the C &amp; AG&apos;s ambit.   This isI ^eubtedly a central objective of the Committee, which reappears, in Recommendation 63.&apos;/ -*   The recommendation is aimed at &quot;all bodies in receint of funds voted by&quot;&quot;&quot;^liament&quot;.   This formula, has the apparent merit of being more orecise than the phrase &quot;public money&quot; which, figured in the Expenditure Committee&apos;s^consnendation 45 r does not seem to meet the Committee^ objective very$ Ml.  Taken literally it would exclude all bodies, including the Gas Corporationy&apos; ^ the 3NCCt which draw public money only in the form of loans from the National-i ^ans Fund.   This ma7 be an oversight by the Committee.   But it is not easy top 32e how the recommendation could be satisfactorily expressed in legislation. On,/ the other hand, the phrase (as now expressed) would include every body which/&apos; Reived a  rant from the Government, from the very largest concerns down tot say,*t? **e smallest bus company.   The phrase would further comprehend any contractor whop Reived a payment, however small, for a Government contract.A 1*** ed\ ^   In so far as the recommendation seelcs to overturn the statutory audittii ir?an.&apos;rements which have been in force for many years in relation to local authorities-, J; ^tionalised industries and certain other public bodies and corporations it is acceptable for the sort of reasons which Ministers have already expressed in theirto the Eleventh Report of the Expenditure Committee.   In relation to commercialSanies, many of which receive funds voted by Parliament, the proposal would to be dovetailed with the requirement of the Companies Acts for the accounts
RESTRICTEDof such bodies to bo audited commercially.   Furthermore it is herd to belisrtthat such a comprehensive coverare-(see paragraph 5 above) for the C &amp; UScculd be justified.   Ac rerards nationalised industries and ether nublicb*mr&quot;iec with furctions cf a primarily commercial cr entTJenr***vririal naturei &apos;the C responsible for av/litin&quot;* the accents       al&quot;&apos; ouch bodi*.*ould be a reversal cf a practice which has grown up over the past 20 year:and has been embodied in numerous statutes over that period.7. If on the ether hand the recommendation is aimed only at extendingC &amp; AGfs access rights rather than his audit powers (cf paragraph 4 above);the main objection is the danger that access by the C &amp; AG to the bcolts K*accounts of commercial bodies would jeopardise their entrepreneurial role.The Government has already said it would, be willing to consider possiblewider access for the C &amp; AG on a case by case basis.-8. The PAC&apos;s Eighth?.eport for Session 1977-73 has separately recommer/i&quot;^that the C   AS should be given ri.cr.ts of access to the bocks and records of  HOC and NE3.   The PAG saw this as an essential step &quot;towards securir.rthe measure of accountability which we believe to be necessary and justifyThe Government are unlikely to arree to this recommendation in relation to2CT? but mav be willing to do so in the case of ENCC provided that depart-&apos;feel that BNOS can be differentiated in this respect from not and nationalindustries menerally-   Such a move would not need legislation and could o9presented as ar example of the Government fs willingness to consider ex3cr.*&apos;the C &amp; AG&apos;s powers of access in particular cases.   The Government&apos;s reptfto the PAC is likely to be published in November.9. Treasury Ministers will shortly be invited to consider whether itbe desirable to introduce amending legislation to the E &amp; A&quot;D Acts, part:&quot;&apos;with a view to putting into effect some of the ideas of the ExpenditureProcedure Committees, &quot;but also with a view to more general simplif icatiflr-&apos;updating of this important legislation much of which has been unchanged 1over a century.   If Ministers agree that such legislation is desirable i-is likely to be on the basis that no change will be nrooosed in the exi^&apos;arran$cements for audit of local authorities   and nationalised industriesthat Ministers are satisfied, at the time when the legislation is intrr--of their ability to hold that line in debate in the House.   But even ****those exclusions there might still be scope for a systematic attempt &apos;itfirst since 1921 - to redraw the limits and rationalise the statutory?r30
of the c &amp; AG&apos;s operations.   It-might also, as explained below in relation&quot;to Reccncendation 63, provide an opportunity to meet one of the points raised &quot;by the Expenditure Committee and the Procedure Committee by removing ny appearance of Executive influence over the C a. AG.In brief, thereforeithe Government are advised to reaffirm their opposition to the major change which would follow from this recommendation.But they could also reaffirm their willingness to look at individual casesfor C &amp; AG access on their individual merits.Heco-^endation 68 and second part of 5-U.   under the E &amp; AD Act 1921, the C &amp; AG appoints his own staff and is responsible for their management.   Bat CSD is responsible for approving the numbers of staff and determining their pay and other conditions ofservice.It is not entirely clear whether the Procedure Committee are proposingtaa-t the powers of appointment and managerial authority over the staff should^e transferred to the House of Commons Commission, as well as the existingHpl* functions of the CSD.   In commenting on the similar recommendation0* the Expenditure Committee, Kr English has made clear that the wider changek What that Committee envisaged and indeed Kr English attempted to introduceProvisions with that effect   during the Parliamentary proceedings on theSouse of Commons (Adjninistration) Act.The effect of such a radical proposal would be to leave the C &amp; AG^without effective authority over his own Department and he would be trans-U*ed from an independent office holder to an executive of the House ofCommons.   The second part of recommendation 68    would then have to beUlcered in that light and would mean that effectively the C &amp; AG would* &quot;under the thumb&quot; of the House of Commons and its Committees and subjectto their direction.U-  A more limited proposition would he the transfer to the House ofCoo*ns cocnission only of the existing powers of the CSD in relation zo^ staff of S &amp; AD.   Such a change would leave the C &amp; AG in full charge0f his Apartment and his independence of action in the discharge of his31 -
statutory responsibilities would be unaffected.    In that context, thes?cor.c oart cf this recorrjr.endatj.cn could be acceptable on the basis that&quot;requests&quot; to initiate inquiries would not be taken as &quot;instructions&quot; or&quot;directions&quot; and that an,r inTJiries so reouestei would be within the au&apos;&quot;-&apos;field and renor+s on then would      in the usual wav to the PAC.15-   Nevertheless, the implications of even this more limited change woul^rcrruire careful consideration.    Primary legislation amending the 19213 ic AD Act would be recuired. and this would provide an opportunity for &apos;^ &quot;to press amendments of a much more radical kind esr those mentioned in para-rraphs 4. to 6, 12 and 13 above.   The chants would mean that thestaffwould no Ion.rer be members of the Home Civil Service and this would clea&quot;:be an important issue which would have to be fully discussed with therepresentatives of the staff concerned.   Consideration would need to be &amp;to the inclusion of a provision, similar to that in the House of Commons(Administration) /Let, reruirinr? the House of Commons Commission to ensure -the complement inr  radium and pay of 2 &amp; AD staff are kent broadly in l*ne .., id *those in the Home Civil Service:   certainly considerable difficulties woU&apos;if the standards for 2 &amp; AD and for the Home Civil Service, became widel?different.&apos;1o.   The implications of the chance for the secondment of 2 &amp; AD staff &quot;fc0assist other Select Committees (to which the second part of recommendati0&quot;relates) would also have to be considered.   Decisions on requests fromCommittees for the services of seconded E &amp; AD staff would remain withinC &amp; AG. but subject to the approval of the House of Commons Commission,i **the exercise of their complementing powers.   Of course, whether powersrelation to E &amp; AD staff were transferred to the House of Commons Comr.ij-or not; the Commission would have a legitimate role, under the House oi .(Administration) Act, in determining the priorities of the various bicsSelect Committees x-rainted to put to the C &amp; AG for the secondment of histo assist them.32
ANNEXACTS F30M THE GOVERNMENTS OBSERVATIONS CN THE ELEVENTH HEFQRTFSOM THE SIPENDCTEE COMMITTEE(Cand 7117)Recommendation 45: Our system of public audit is out nf date and theExchequer d Audit Departmatts Acts should be amended and should state as a principle tliat the E at. AD may audit any accounts into which public money goes even if such public money is not the bulk oj receipts into suchaccounts. Where public money is the bulk of receipts into an account, theE &amp; AD should always audit theni, subject only to such specific exceptionsas are made in the- amended Act.91. If the Committee&apos;; recommendation were adopted without qualification,the Comptroller and Auditor General (C &amp; AG) could take over the auditof local authorities, nationalised industries, and other public bodies engagedin operations of a commercial nature, as well as a large number of private sector bodies and companies to which the Government provides assistance.The Government do not agree that such an extention of the C &amp; AG&apos;saudit would be sensible. Local authority audit is dealt with in the reply torecommendauon 46.. In: the case of the nationalised industries, the government believe that the main question is whether the auditors appointed in accordancewith current statutes possess the professional drill and experience in commercialaccounting as well as the independent status for their task; and that the answer to this question is -yes&quot;. The Government do not believe that the cost ofreinforcing the resources of the Exchequer and Audit Department on the scalenecessary to take over this work would be justified. Whenever new public sectoror quasi-public sector bodies are set up, either under legislation or otherwise,the Government will continue 10 consider carefully whether the C &amp; AG shouldaudit or have access to their accounts.&quot;&quot;92. If might be suggested that whatever may be the decision on the extentto which the C Sc. AG should audit the accounts of various bodies receivingpublic funds, he should be empowered to have access to the books and records of all recipients of public funds for the purpose of any specific enquiry. TheGovernment recognise that to ensure ah adequate&apos;degree of accountability toParliament there may be circumstances where it would be appropriate to afford the C &amp; AG access to the books and records of such bodies. But theGovernment doubt whether it would be possible to define in advance thecircumstances in which a specific right of access for the C Sl AG would be appropriate and how it might be secured, and they consider that eachjasemustJx judged on its merits. In reaching a decision on such cases, the Govern-ment would&quot; seek the views of the Committee of Public Accounts and of theRecommendation 50: Vie proposed new House of Commons Commissionthtfuid discharge in relation to die services of the House the functionsdischarged by tlie Treasury in relation to other Estimates:103. The Government accept thb Committee^ recommendation that theproposed new House of Commons Commission should exercise the role nowdischarged by Treasury Ministers in relation to expenditure on the services and staff of the House. This change will be incorporated in legislation, which willbe introduced as soon as Parliamentary time is available, to implement therecommendauons of the Committee under the chairmanship of Mr ArthurBottomiey, MP. which made proposals in 1975 for the future administration ofthe House of Commons under the new Commission.C Sl AG.33
STRiCTEDRecommendation 51: 77;* c   AC and the staff ofthe E &amp; AD should beplaced under the House of Commons Commission and thus becomeParliamentary staff so that it will become clear that they should initiateenquiries if so requested by the House or one of its Committees.104. The Government consider it to be of cardinal importance that theC &amp; AG should not be subject to directions from any quarter in the exerciseof the duties laid on him by statute to undertake an effective audit and scrutiny of the expenditure of the Executive. He and his staff are, and should remain,in a different position from that of the staff of Parliament. The government do not accept, therefore, that the legislation referred to in paragraph 103above should alter the status of the C &amp; AG and his staff.3 October 1973 -34
