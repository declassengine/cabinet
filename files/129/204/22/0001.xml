UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 12228 November 1978EUROPEAN MONETARY system memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. There have been a number of developments on the EuropeanMonetary System (EMS) since I circulated my paper CP(78) 114 on31 October.    Many of these developments were   reflected in the green paper we published last week.    However nothing that has happened sofar leads me to revise the analysis in that paper or the recommendationI then made to my colleagues:  that we should not join the exchange rateregime of the EMS on the terms at present available.     I am not satisfiedthat the exchange rate proposals meet our criteria of durability,avoidance of deflationary bias and symmetry of obligations betweenstronger and weaker economies,2. During November:-i.       President Carter&apos;s measures of 1 November have stabilisedthe dollar for the present and more than regained ground lost inOctober, though at the cost of heavy intervention by the UnitedStates, German and Japanese central banks.    We cannot be surewhat will happen to the dollar in the first half of 1979, but if it ismoving substantially in either direction, that could impose strainson a regime of fixed exchange rates in Western Europe;ii.       the Germans havo in fact moved towards the position ofother Community members on credit.     They now accept that thetotal credit available should be 25 billion European Currency Units(ECUs), as originally contemplated at Bremen.    There are stillsome differences about the division between short and medium termcredit;iii.        the Germans still resist an automatic obligation in theexchange rate regime on a country with a divergent strongcurrency to intervene to hold it down and to avoid placing a burdenof debt on other countries in doing so.    The French are pressingthem, so far unsuccessfully, to accept that failure to take some action (not necessarily intervention) would be &quot;exceptional&quot;;copy NOCABINET
iv.        it still seems to be an open question whether Italy andIreland v/ill join the exchange rate regime, but it would be wrong to build on the possibility that they will not;v.       the Green Paper which the Cabinet approved on 23 November(CM(78) 40th Conclusions, Minute 4) has been well received,There has been considerable domestic support for the proposition that we should not join the exchange rate regime of the EMS now,but should support some of its medium term aims, including thedevelopment of larger co-operative European credit arrangements,the promotion of a European reserve asset and greater convergenceof economic performance;vi.       President Giscard has shown himself ready to accept withouthostility that Britain might not join the exchange rate zegime atthe outset;  and to treat this as a technical rather than a politicalmatter.    If the French react in this way, there is a fair chance that most other Community members will do the same.3. In the Green Paper (eg paragraphs 3 and 30) we said that we did not regard the European Monetary Ssytem proposed at Bremen as confined tothe mechanism for linking exchange rates.    In his Press Conferencefollowing the discussions with President Giscard on 24 November the PrimeMinister said that there were varying parts of the scheme, which mightembrace some members of the Community, but not all,4. I think there is advantage in deferring a final and definitiveannouncement that we will not join the exchange rate regime until theEuropean Council on 4-5 December.    By doing so we show readiness to listen to any final offer from the Germans, we may help to keep theItalians and Irish with us (especially on most aspects of the question ofresource transfers within the Community) and we may appear lessisolated.    However, we need to decide now our attitude to other aspectsof the EMS, given a decision to stay out of the exchange rate scheme.5. If Ireland and Jtaly were to stay out of the exchange rate regimeit is possible that there would be no attempt to set up the EMS as a community scheme at this stage.    If however it is proposed to set it upas a Community scheme, we should stipulate that this is done in a way which is acceptable to us.    As the prime Minister said in Paris: &quot;TheCommunity scheme must embrace all members of the Community, other-wise it cannot be a Community scheme. &quot;    Our requirements would be:-i.       The door must be open for us to join at any time if we wish,and there must be scope to amend the scheme to make it more acceptable.ii.       It should be possible to include sterling with otherCommunity currencies in the ECU, if necessary on a &quot;frozen&quot;basis as contemplated for currencies on &quot;conge&quot; from theexchange rate regime.secret
iii. The possibility that we could participate in the swap ofexisting reserves for ECU should be kept opena    We could judge the merits of such a swap when more details have been worked out.iv. We should participate in the extended credit arrangements,on the understanding that some limitation of our rights and obliga-tions could be negotiated within that.    We do not wish to be excluded, but we do not propose to incur large automaticobligations to help defend currencies inside the scheme - and cannot expect the converse.v.       If Community mechanisms were used for new resourcetransfers in response to the &quot;concurrent studies&quot;, we could not accept that they should discriminate against us simply because we wers not joining the exchange rate regime.    This would apply for example to an interest rate subsidy for European InvestmentBank loans.vi.        We would continue to argue our case for a major reductionin the United Kingdom net contribution to the Community Budget.We would propose more permanent machinery to promoteeconomic convergence in the Community, which ought to cover both concerted action for higher growth and lower inflation:and convergence through tha transfer of resources to the lessprosperous countries.vii. We should be included in future discussions of all aspectsof the EMS other than day to day operation of the exchange rateregime;  including relations with the dollar.Our attitude to the relevant Community instruments etc. would be governed accordingly (including the two current regulations on the composition of the ECU and the power of the European MonetaryCo-operation Fund to issue ECUs).6. I invite the agreement of my colleaguss to the approach outlined in paragraph 5.D W treasury Chambers28 November 19783
