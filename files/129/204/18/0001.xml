NT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp*78)118 COPY NO 8013 November 1978CABINETFINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR 16-18 YEAR OLDS INFULL-TIME education memorandum by the Secretary of State for education and Science and Paymaster GeneralINTRODUCTION1* We agreed on 26th October (CM(78) 36th Conclusions, Minute 3)that there would be no specific provision in this year&apos;s Public expenditure survey (PES) round for a mandatory scheme of maintenance grants for16-18 year olds staying on in schools or in further education colleges;I accept that we accordingly cannot hope to have a scheme with full nationalcoverage in operation from next September, and I do not seek to re-openthat question.2. However, I feel most strongly that it would do us great damage ifwe were to let the present initiative slip completely.    The need for a propersystem of allowances is more widely recognised than ever it was.    We have said publicly that we would be ready to commit ourselves to such a scheme in due course, subject to timing and cost:  it would have a grave effect onour supporters up and down the country if we gave them no indication thatit was our intention to proceed as and when resources were available.In this connection much attention will be paid to the forthcoming education bill.    If the Bill does not include even an enabling power there will be widespread criticism not least amongst our own supporters.    An enablingpower will be needed if ever we are to introduce more systematic support arrangements for 16-18 year olds;  and legislation opportunities do notarise so frequently that we can afford to pass up this one, the last in thepresent Parliament.    At the same time I appreciate that there aredifficulties about the build-up of expenditure over the PES period in myoriginal scheme.    We need more time to think about the details, while leaving no doubt about our intentions.    It is also important to give some immediate help to areas where youth unemployment is high and staying-onrates low.3. With all this in mind I seek agreement to a more limited packagethan that which I proposed on 26&apos;   October.    These proposals were considered by the Home and Social Affairs Committee on 8 November andconsist essentially of:-
i.       legislation which would enable pilot schemes to go ahead and also provide the framework for the eventual introduction ofa national scheme;ii.       a pilot programme reflecting the main feaures of the fullnational scheme but restricted to selected volunteer localeducation authority (LEA) areas;iii.       monitoring and consultation arrangements to evaluate the pilot schemes and provide a basis for eventual decision on anational scheme.These features are discussed more fully below.LEGISLATION4. I would have a clause drafted in such a way that the powers and duties on LEAs would only come into operation as determined by orders made by Education Ministers (who could also revoke them):  the detailed arrangements for the scheme would be prescribed by regulation. TheGovernment would thus retain full control over the coverage, character and duration of the pilot programme.    The clause would also provide forthe establishment of a full mandatory scheme in the future, through orderslaid before both Houses of Parliament and approved by affirmative resolution.5. Such broadly-drafted legislation would allow pilot schemes to go ahead which were comprehensive in their coverage in selected areas (andthus representative of a future national scheme).    It would also clearlyindicate our long-term intentions for full national coverage in due course,while giving us complete control over the transition from pilot to nationalcoverage.PILOT SCHEMES6* If Cabinet agree and the legislation is passed in time, a modestpilot programme covering a limited number of LEAs could be launchedfrom September 19/9.    I envisage that the legislation would provide for admission of LEAs to the programme at Education ministers discretion.Some LEAs are already introducing schemes of their own (Sheffield,Newcastle, the Inner London Education Authority, and Wakefield): we need to take a grip on this situation and not let it develop in a lame andhaphazard way.    Those LEAs would be considered for inclusion, but inmy view we should give high priority to Special Development Areas (SDAs)and areas where participation in 16+ education is lowest and youthunemployment highest.    I would want to settle the final criteria inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Employment.    There is a fairdegree of correlation between the three criteria I am suggesting: Tyneand Wear, for example, has SDA status, youth unemployment more than50 per cent above the national average and an education participation rateof about three-quarters of the national average.2
7. The pilot schemes would apply to all staying on or returning to post-compulsory full-time education, both in schools and in further educationcolleges, and would be on the basis of a  7. 50 per week means-testedallowance: family entitlement to Child Benefit would continue, raising the effective value of the award to a level where it should significantly increaseparticipation.    Authorities would receive 90 per cent specific grant ontheir award costs;  their education and administration costs would beexpenditure supported in the usual way by Rate Support Grant. Non-participating authorities would remain free to give discretionary awards,as at present,8. The pilot programme could not be cash-limited, because we cannotforecast accurately in advance how many additional young people wouldBtay on in particular hard-pressed areas.    But reasonably accurateestimates can be made and calculations suggest that a sum-  of  15 million would meet the costs of pilot schemes covering a proportion of thepopulation approaching 15 per cent of the country in a full year of operation.For instance, it would allow us to cover all English LEAs which are entirely or mainly in SDAs (eg those in Merseyside, Tyne and Wear, plus,say, Durham and Cumbria), some or all of Wales if the Secretary of Statefor Wales so wished, together with a few other areas of opecial difficulty.The corresponding first year figure would be lower, about  10 million,because it would cover two terms only.MONITORING AND CONSULTATIVE ARRANGEMENTS9. We have promised a White Paper next year on 16-19 education and training.    We need to carry the local authority associations with us as far as possible on the policies contained in that White Paper;  and tothis end I propose consultations with them on all its main elements, suchas the extension of vocational preparation for young employees, which isnow being studied.    I would like now to involve the local authoritiespurposefully in joint study of how to secure greater participation in full-time education, through 16-18 awards or otherwise.    At the same time it is important that we monitor and evaluate carefully the progress of the pilot programme.    The consultative and monitoring processes could be closely related, under the guidance of a small high level Government/LEAworking party.    I would be happy to consult colleagues about theirDepartments1 involvement in this.10. I would make arrangements for other necessary consultations, withthe teacher interests for example, to proceed separately.    I remainconvinced of the unwisdom of establishing a large committee of enquiry,which would risk stalling all our initiatives.3
RESOURCES11. As noted, my proposals call for  10 million in 1979-80 and 15 million in 1980-81 (the first full year).    The latter (and any sumsrequired for the subsequent years of the pilot programme) would be found from resources allocated (or to be allocated) to Education.    I understandthat the Secretary of State for Employment is ready to consider thepossibility that the cost in 1979-80 might be met from the PES provisionalready made for the Manpower Services Commission.CONCLUSION12. I invite my colleagues to agree that legislation should go forward on the basis described above, and that discussions on the planning of apilot programme should be undertaken in consultation with the Departmentof Employment, the Treasury and the local authority associations.S w department of Education and Science13 November 19784
