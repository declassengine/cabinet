15V*S LOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(78) 130COPY NO12 December 197880CABINETSTATE F UNDING OF EUROFEAN ASSEMBLY ELECTIONSMemorandum by the Lord President of the council. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and I met a delegation from the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party on 31 october to discuss the question of financing the European Assembly election nextJune.     In the light of that discussion, I have been considering with a small group of Ministers the feasibility of providing financial assistance to candidates taking part in the Assembly election, bearing in mind the variouselection commitments which the political parties face nex* year and the factthat  funds available from the Community for this election are intended forinformation purposes, not to meet election campaign expenses,THE SCHEME2. We have concluded that an acceptable scheme of financial assistanceto candidates can be devised.    Legislation would be required to give iteffect.    The main featuree of the scheme would be as follows:-a. To deter fringe or frivolous candidatures, financialassistance would be available retrospectively only to candidateswho obtained a pre-determined share of the votes cast in the constituency.    We recommend a threshold of 5 per cent in orderto qualify for funds.b. Those qualifying would be entitled to reimbursement of50 per cent cf their maximum permitted election expenses, or their actual expenses if lower than 50 per cent.c. A satisfactory audit and accounting procedure can be set upto ensure that the public funds involved are not used for anythingother than the intended purpose;  this procedure would build uponthe existing provisions under which candidates submit returns oftheir election expenses to the acting returning officer in eachconstituency.d. The scheme should be seen as a one-off exercise limited tothe 1979 Assembly election alone.
THE THRESHOLD3. The Home Secretary is responsible for the regulations for the conductof the European Assembly elections, and it is in that framework that he willdetermine the size of the deposit, the maximum permitted election expenses,the threshold for saving the deposit and the number of backers a candidate&apos;snomination must have.    These points are dealt with in a separate paper,CP(78) 129.     On the key question of the threshold, our view is that in orderto be consistent with our practice in Parliamentary elections, we should maintain 12^ per cent as the threshold for saving the deposit but should as suggested above use   per cent as the threshold for candidates to qualify for financial aid under this scheme.THE COST4. The cost to public funds of a scheme on these lines will depend onthe number of candidates who obtain 5 per cent or more of the votes cast.On the basis of experience in other elections, it seems reasonable to assume that on average not more than 4 candidate*s per Assembly constituency will secure a 5 per cent share of the vote.    In Northern Ireland, where theEuropean Assembly election is to be conducted under the single transferable vote system, the 5 per cent threshold would be the equivalent of a candidateobtaining 10 per cent of the quota at any stage of the count;    on this basis,it is estimated that   6 Northern Ireland candidates would qualify forreimbursement.    The total cost of the scheme to public funds, assuming that 4 candidates qualify in each of the 78 British constituencies and 6qualify in Northern Ireland, is estimated at  2.4 million.    The Grouprecommends that this cost be borne on the Consolidated Fund, as is thecase with other expenses connected with the Assembly and Westminsterelections.    There is at present no provision in public expenditure plans for this amount, which would thus fall as an additional bid against the1978-79 Contingency Reserve,SOUNDINGS5. I have been taking informal soundings of the other parties toestablish whether there is enough support in the House for this Bill. the conservatives have said that they will oppose it.    They have also saidthat they will not join in an all-Party advisory committee to superviseexpenditure by the Commission and Assembly on information programmes.For the Liberals the level of the threshold is of crucial importance. Theyhave indicated that they would support a 5 per cent threshold for qualifying for financial aid, though attaching to this an unacceptable - and probablyunworkable - condition that public funds should only be provided if corporate(ie trade union and company) contributions were disqualified.    I shall behaving further consultations and will report the outcome orally to Cabinet.2
conclusion, Subject to the further information I shall give Cabinet on my contacts with the Liberals, I recommend that a scheme on these lines be agreed tohelp meet the costs of the Assembly election and I invite my colleagues to endorse it with a view to a Bill being introduced shortly after the christmas recess.M FPrivy Council Office12 December 19783
