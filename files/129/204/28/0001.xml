Document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government cp(78) 128 copy no 8011 December 1978cabinetPUBLIC EXPENDITURE WHITE paper memorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury. I attach a draft of Part I of the public expenditure White Paper. Idraw the Cabinet&apos;s attention particularly to the following features.THE PLANNING FIGURES2. The figures have changed from those considered by Cabinet, as a consequence of the usual re-working to take account of estimating changes,including changes to achieve consistency with the recently publishedeconomic forecast.    I advised the Cabinet in October that such changesmight make it necessary to reduce the Contingency Reserve figures.3. The re-estimation has not greatly affected the figures for next year,1979-80;  but it has increased the planning total for 1980-81 which now exceeds the comparable figures in the last public expenditure White Paper (Cmnd 7049)by  96 million, compared with an excess of  38 million after our discussion in October.    This excess has been removed by adjusting the contingency reserve figures for the four future years from 800, 1500, 2100, 2500 to 800,1400, 2000 and 2500 (all figures in   million at 1978 Survey prices). Thisbrings the new plans for 1979-80 and 1980-81 broadly into line with the comparable figures in the previous White Paper and provides a reasonableprogression of figures for the Contingency Reserve.4. The summary table of the planning figures (Table 1) includes an assumption about shortfall in forward years, which has been omitted in thelast two White Papers.    It is emphasised in the text that this allowance doesnot form part of the control totals, but it avoids the discontinuity which otherwise distorts comparison between the forward and past years.THE ECONOMIC CONTEXT5. The absence in recent White Papers of quantified medium-termprojections of the economy as a context for the expenditure plans has been widely criticised.    The House of Commons Expenditure Committee1
recommended in their Report on the last White Paper that the Government1 smedium-term assessment should be published, and might seek to enforcethis recommendation unless material is included this year which goes someway towards meeting the criticism.6. I believe that we can and should do this, but at the same timemaintain the position we have rightly taken on the status of medium-termprojections.    The approach adopted in the draft (paragraphs 17-37) is toinclude a range of illustrative projections on three different assumptions about future earnings and to emphasise the fragility of the econometricrelationships underlying them.    It is also emphasised that the projectionsare neither predictions nor expressions of the Government&apos;6 intentions nor do they cover the full range of possibilities;  and reasons are indicated why we do not go further in elaborating the projections.7. No projections are given for unemployment but, as already undertaken to the Expenditure Committee, the chapter on the social security programmeincludes the working assumptions about unemployment and real earningswhich underlie the social security figures and which are in fact broadlyconsistent both with the second of the illustrative projections and with therecent economic forecast.TAXATION AND REVENUE8. As last year, the draft includes projections of tax revenue andborrowing requirements incorporating the expenditure plans.    The draftalso includes this year a discussion of tax reliefs and the part which theycan play, alongside expenditure, in promoting policy objectives.PARTS 2 TO 69. Parts 2 to 6, containing the chapters on the separate programmes and supplementary material, are being circulated to Cabinet for clearanceby correspondence.    The chapters on the programmes contain additionalmaterial on outturn against earlier plans and about levels of service financed by the expenditure.    An analysis is also included of expenditure on services to be devolved to Scotland and Wales if, following the Referendums, devolutiongoes ahead.CONCLUSION10. I seek the Cabinet&apos;s agreement that I should arrange for publication ofthe White Paper in mid-January, subject to any further minor revisions ordrafting amendments which may become necessary between now and then.J treasury Chambers11 December 19782

The present plans provide for the totalto increase by about 2 per cent a year in volume terms over the next four years.2. Stability of the main framework of expenditure plans continues to be animportant objective. This permits and encourages forward planning of pro-grammes, and contributes to efficiency. To plan faster growth of the total would limit the room for fiscal manoeuvre and would significantly increase therisk that the plans would later have to be cut back, causing disruption anddisappointment.3. The planning figures in this White Paper for individual programmes in1979-80 will be the basis for cash limits and for the Governmenfs requests toParliament for voted expenditure. The Government have already announcedthat these two control systems are being brought together; over most of the fieldthis will have been done in time for 1979-80.4. It remains the Governmenfs policy to use the contingency reserveas a control figure, within which any decisions which add to programmes willbe contained.5. For the later years the figures are increasingly provisional. The need toestablish a reliable planning framework, and to lay out the implications for future years of decisions already made and foreseen requirements, does not mean that every element of every programme should be settled four years ahead. In theselater years a substantial and increasing margin has been retained unallocated forthe time being, so as to leave some room for decisions to be taken nearer thetime.Summary of the planning figures6. The planning figures for the main public expenditure aggregates over thenext four years are shown in table 1, together with outturn figures for past yearsand an early estimate for the current year. More detailed tables are at the endof Part 1 and in Part 5.

The present plans provide for the total to continue to grow by around2 per cent a year in 1981-82 and 1982-83. The programmes for the later years will be reviewed in future expenditure surveys.9. The pattern of programmes has changed little since the last White Paper.The main increases are in the programmes for social security, employmentservices, health and law and order. These increases have been covered over thenext two years from provision previously unallocated and from reductions inthe estimated financing requirements of the nationalised industries.10. To avoid discontinuity in moving from actual figures for previous years to planning figures, table 1 includes a general allowance for shortfall in future years. Some continuing difference is to be expected between planning figures and outturn, and the Government allow for this in taking decisions both aboutexpenditure plans and about taxation. Such an allowance can only be tentativeand does not form part of the expenditure control totals. The amount assumedfor all years of the planning period is similar to that so far expected for thecurrent year.Public expenditure table 11 Central government ............ 2 Local authorities ............... 3 Certain public corporations(a) ......... 4 Total expenditure on programmes(l 4-2+3) 5 Contingency reserve ............ 6 Debt interest ............... 7 Total public expenditure^ 4-5 4-6) ......	out turns 1973-74    1974-75 1975-76	39,531       43,362 44,029 16,875      18,498 18,400 1,238        1,251 1,304	57,644      63,111 63,733 1,164        1,132 1,316	58,808      64,243 65,0498 Total expenditure on programmes and con-contingency reserve(4 4-5)............ 9 Net overseas and market borrowing of nation-nationalised industries(c) ............ 10 Planning total for future years(84-9) ......

Unless otherwise stated, general discussion of expenditure in this white Paper is in terms of this total (see table 1, lines 10 and 12), and all figures are at 1978survey prices. See Part 6, pages 000-000 and 000-000.and 1973-76, expenditure fell by nearly J per cent in 197tf^7^&quot;anc/&quot;by about *7percent in 1977-78.12. The January 1977 White Paper (Cmnd 6721) provided for plannedexpenditure on programmes in 1976-77 to be slightly above that of the pre-vious year, but actual expenditure turned out about 3 per cent (some  2 billion)below the planned level, mainly because of shortfall in the programmes for industry and employment, roads and transport, housing and nationalised industry borrowing. In 1977-78, some reduction in expenditure was plannedcompared with the plans for the previous year^but the actual fall was greaterbecause of another large shortfall in nationalised industry borrowing and a saving of about  700 million on refinancing of export and shipbuilding credit,partly due to the new agreement between the Government and the banks.Actual expenditure in 1977-78 is now estimated to have been about 6 per cent(some  4 billion) below the plans in Cmnd 6721 (see tables 2 and 5.H-G).Excluding nationalised industry borrowing and the savings in refinancing,shortfall was similar to that in the previous year. It occurred mainly in housing subsidies, where interest rates fell more than foreseen, and on employmentmeasures and some parts of the industry and roads programmes, where new schemes made slower progress than expected.1973-74 to 1982-83  million at 1978 survey prices	out turns			Plans			1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-83			estimated					42,598	40,248	45,038	46,639	46,779	47,284	48,175	117,518	16,598	16,951	17,338	17,597	17,750	17,852	21,189	971	969	1,110	1,100	1,053	1,035	361,305	57,817	62,958	65,087	65,476	66,087	67,062	4 	 	4Kb)	800	1,400	2,000	2,500	51,761	2,173	2,200	2,300	2,400	2,400	2,300	663,066	59,990	65,199	68,187	69,276	70,487	71,862	761,305	57,817	62,999	65,887	66,876	68,087	69,562	81,559	501	-100	-650	-200	-200	-150	9			65,237	66,676	67,887	69,412	10...

In 1978-79, expenditure is at present expected to rise by about 6 per centcompared with 1977-78, to a level some 4-5 per cent above that of 1973-74.Excluding nationalised industry borrowing, the refinancing of export and shipbuilding credit and the sale in 1977-78 of British Petroleum shares, theincrease between 1977-78 and 1978-79 is expected to be about 2^-3 per cent.15. Shortfall in the current year is still put tentatively, as it was at the timeof the Budget, at  2 billion, well below the 1977-78 figure. The programmetables in Part 2 give early estimates of the actual volume of expenditure on eachprogramme which imply shortfall of about  1 billion, after allowing for changescharged to the contingency reserve. It is judged unlikely that shortfall has beenfully identified at this stage. Hence a further allowance is made in table 1 forshortfall not yet identified and this brings the total to  2 billion (see table 2).Table 2Plans and estimated out turns, 1977-78 and 1978-79  million at 1978 survey prices	1977-78	1978-79Planning totals from earlier White Papers^) .........	62,179	63,907Shortfall:		Identified or provisionally identified ............	-3,861	-1,008Further allowance.....................	 	-992Estimated outturn(2).....................	58,318	61,907(&apos;) Cmnd 6721 for 1977-78 and Cmnd 7049 for 1978-79: all figures have been revalued to1978 survey prices.(2) Compare table 1, line 12.Public expenditure and GDP16. The ratio of total public expenditure to gross domestic product (GDP)is estimated at some 42 per cent in the current year (see table 3). With the slowgrowth of output in recent years, the ratio has tended to change in line withthe changes in public expenditure. It rose steeply to a peak of 46J per cent in1975-76, and was brought back over the two subsequent years to 40$ per cent.A rise of between one and two percentage points to 42 per cent is projected forthe current year. The ratio of general government expenditure on goods and services / hows a similar pattern up to 1978-79, when expenditure in this category is expected to rise more slowly than expenditure on transfers. Theratios implied for the years ahead by the expenditure plans in this White paper will be affected by the growth of GDP, relative movements of costs between thepublic sector and the economy as a whole and the amount of shortfall in expenditure.Table J		per ecu	/	General government	Total public	expenditure on	expenditure	goods and services1972-73 ..................	39	231973-74 ..................	40i	24*1974-75 ..................	46	261975-76 ..................	46i	271976-77 ............ ......	44	261977-78 ..................	40J	241978-79 (projected) ............	42	23iadmitted.(&apos;) These estimates are based on the expenditure figures in this White Paper/by the inclusionof non-trading government capital consumption, to make them comparable with gross domestic product (expenditure estimate) at market prices.The economic context17. In deciding policy on total expenditure the Government take accountof the prospects for the economy, particularly for the growth of GDP and thebalance of tax and expenditure. This section of the White Paper discusses themain factors in an assessment of the prospects, and includes three illustrativeprojections of expenditure and output. This provides a background for thepublic expenditure plans by showing the possible implications for GDP andthe pattern of demand of certain assumptions, for example about world tradeand inflation. Projections of this kind are neither predictions nor expressions of the Government^ intentions; nor do they cover the full range of possibilities.Their usefulness is limited in current circumstances not only by the uncertaintiesconcerning the course of the world economy and the future rates of inflation,but by the insecurity of some of the econometric relationships on which theydepend, such as that between output and employment. The Government do notbelieve that it is fruitful to publish more elaborate projections covering other elements in the economy for a period four years ahead. Some of the relationshipsare especially fragile and the hypothetical nature of the exercise is liable tomisunderstanding, which could itself affect market expectations and behaviour.Recent developments18. In the past year the economy has grown quite strongly. Gross domestic product, on the new 1975 price base for the national accounts, probably roseby about 3 per cent, with a continuing fast growth in investment in privatemanufacturing. Personal living standards improved strongly, and there was some reduction in the number of unemployed, which, however, as in most otherindustralised countries, remains at high levels.

North Sea oil output has grown and oil imports have fallen, but imports of finished manufactures have con-tinued to rise strongly. There has been only a modest increase in manufacturingoutput. Despite improved terms of trade, the external current account hasweakened slightly. The Industry Act forecast published last November showed the economy still growing in 1979, though at a slower pace than in the past year.The prospects for the medium-term20. The growth rate in the medium-term will be largely determined bydevelopments in the world economy, in Britain&apos;s trade performance, in productivity and in inflation. The first of these affects both the buoyancy of exports and the UK&apos;s terms of trade with the rest of the world.External developments and financing21. The growth of world trade remained low in 1978. Some recoveryseems likely in 1979 as activity in the main European economies picks up.The projections described below assume that world trade in manufacturesrises by 1\ per cent in 1979 and by about 6\ per cent a year thereafter. This wouldbe a considerable improvement on the growth recorded in the past two years(about 4 per cent), but still well below the average of about 10 per cent forthe years before 1974.22. Competitors&apos; unit labour costs in manufacturing are assumed to goon rising at the past trend rate of about 5 per cent (in terms of domesticcurrencies).23. The UK&apos;s terms of trade have improved recently, partly as a resultof falls in commodity prices. The projections assume that they remain broadlyunchanged at their 1978 level.Capital repaymentsas at end September 1977as at end December 1978Interestas at end September 1977as at end December 19781978	1979-81	1982-84	1985 and after0.9	11.2	8.3	3.8 	9.0	7.2	7.21.7	4.2	1.5	1.4 	5.1	2.8	2.725. The Governments aim will continue to be to combine net repayment of debt year by year with new borrowing to spread the maturities.Productivity and productive potential26. The growth of the economy&apos;s productive potential the rate at whichoutput can rise, over time, at a constant pressure of demand is determinedby the growth of the working population, its productivity, and the contribution of North Sea oil and gas. The actual rate at which output rises will depend notonly on this underlying growth of productive potential but also on the extentto which resources can be brought into productive use. In the short-termactual and potential output growth can differ markedly, but as the time horizonlengthens productive potential becomes an increasingly dominant influence onthe growth of output.27. Table 5 shows the trend growth of productive potential in the 1960sand early 1970s and estimates of its growth in recent years and in the future.The estimates of the underlying growth of output per head are particularlyuncertain. There have been great problems lately in relating changes inemployment to changes in output. The historical relationship between thesehas not predicted satisfactorily the employment associated with recent levels of GDP. The estimates of the underlying growth of output per head for thepast few years and those projected for the future are therefore extremelyuncertain.24. Over the next few years substantial amounts of the external debtincurred in the years of deficit fall due for repayment. In 1978 the Governmentrepaid $4.7 billion of foreign currency debt, much of it in advance, partly fromthe proceeds of longer-term borrowing; over the same period new borrowingamounted to $2.5 billion. Outstanding debt in dollar terms has fallen by lessthan the $2  billion of net repayments because the depreciation of the dollarhas increased the dollar value of the debt in other currencies. Table 4 gives theprofile of debt maturities as it stood at end-September 1977 and end-December1978 and shows how the maturities in the early 1980s have been spread.28. Recent experience taken on its own suggests that the underlying growth of output per head has fallen considerably. The low productivity recordedbetween 1974 and 1977 was to some extent the result of the economic recession;recorded productivity appears to have risen as output moved ahead in 1978.But the poor productivity performance in recent years also appears to reflectdeeper-seated causes. The underlying growth of productivity in most industrial countries seems to have fallen since the early 1970s. With high unemployment and relatively low investment throughout the industrialised world, it couldbe several years before productivity returns to the trend increases experiencedbefore 1973. The low recorded productivity growth of 1974-77 has to some
previous ten years, at about /J par cent. &quot;&quot;&apos;&apos; &quot; &quot; ***Productive PotentialTable 5 Avenge annual per cent changes at 1975 prices	1964-74(3)    1974-77(3) 1977-82Recorded output per head: Manufacturing ... ............

It is not possible toestimate precisely when the underlying rate of growth of productivity fell, but it was probably not until some time after the particularly large fall in output began in 1974. In this table itis therefore more convenient to include 1974 in the earlier period, with the second periodcomprising the years 1975, 1976 and 1977.29. The relatively constant underlying rates of potential output growththat appeared well established in the 1950s and 1960s can no longer be countedupon. A range of increases in productivity of 1^-2$ per cent a year is shown intable 5 for the period to 1982, but the range of possible outcomes is considerablywider than this. The projections described below assume that output per headgrows roughly at the centre of this range but that its pace of recovery will varyslightly with the pace of growth of output; but even in the highest growthcase of the three projections the underlying growth of productivity is still putbelow its earlier trend. Thus even with North Sea oil and a faster growth ofthe labour supply, productive potential is unlikely to grow much above its pre-1973 trend of about 3 per cent.Prices and earnings30. The Government remain determined to secure a further reductionin the rate of inflation, and regard this as an essential pre-condition for achieving the substantial increase in living standards and employment that the countryseeks.31. The rate of price increase in 1978 was reduced by the comparatively lowincreases in money incomes in the 1976-77 pay round together with otherfavourable factors, notably the strength of sterling, low food and commodity prices and the lower average level of mortgage rates. In the 1977-78 pay roundearnings rose by about 14 per cent and by somewhat more in manufacturing,where unit labour cost rose by perhaps 13 per cent. These are much largerincreases than in the 1976-77 round and will continue to affect prices into 1979.Because of this, and because other factors will generally be operating lessfavourably than in 1978, it is not only essential to prevent any renewed increase&apos; *&quot;&quot;*&apos; &apos;&apos;*&apos;- --**..:*7f..    .... a.TI.J;,W --.Ji-...-..J- J...............-..J ;.;lute with flic cjox eminent s guidelines. anU on maintaining a monetary potlayconsistent with this objective.GDP and the pattern of demand32. Table 6 gives the figures for the three illustrative projections. Their limita-tions must again be stressed: see paragraph 17. All incorporate the presentexpenditure plans. All make the same assumptions about the world economicbackground. The main differences lie in the assumptions made about earnings,productivity, monetary management and competitiveness. In each case the projected level of private expenditure is varied to provide for a satisfactorybalance of payments.33. There are three illustrative assumptions on earnings. Case A assumes that average earnings rise by about 7 per cent during the current pay round (as inthe Industry Act forecast published in November) and by 5 per cent in the 1979-80 and subsequent pay rounds. This assumption is broadly consistent withbringing the rise in unit labour costs into line with that of our strongest com-competitors. Case B assumes a constant (7 per cent) growth of earnings throughoutthe period. Case C illustrates a less satisfactory outcome, with earnings rising at11 per cent a year throughout the period. These three cases would imply sig-nificantly different rates of price increase: in cases A and B the annual rate of increase in retail prices would continue to fall from present levels; in case C itwould quickly return to double figures and remain close to 10 per cent through-out the period of the projections. As noted in paragraph 29, the pace of recovery in productivity is assumed to vary slightly with the rate of growth of output, andis thus fastest in case A. Monetary management is assumed to be less thanaccommodating to the growth of nominal GDP in the higher inflation case.These assumptions imply that in case A and, less so, in case B labour costs in manufacturing rise more slowly than the average for competitor countries, andUK competitiveness improves; in case C competitiveness worsens.Table 6Expenditure and output in the medium termAnnual average per cent changes at 1975 prices	1964-73	1973-77	case A	1977-82 case B	case CConsumers&apos; expenditure......	2.7	-1.1	3i	3i	2iGovernment consumption	2.5	2.1	li	II	liGross fixed investment ......	3.5	-2.2	2	li	iExports of goods and services  ...	6.4	4.6	X	51	4iTotal final expenditure ......	3.5	0.1	3i	3i	2*Imports of goods and services ...	5.8	-0.6	5i	5i	4*GDP (market prices) ......	3.0	0.3	3	2i	2GDP (factor cost).........	3.0	0.4	3	2i	2World trade in manufactures	10.1	5.1	6\	6i	67

Net incomes have been further raised in the past yearby tax reductions and increases in child benefit (a further increase is to take effect next April), and consumption should rise on a more even path than gross earnings.35. Table 6 shows the growth of GDP and pattern of demand implied bythe three projections and compares it with the patterns recorded in earlierperiods. All the projections represent a marked improvement on the fouryears 1973-77, but only in case A does output regain on average over theperiod to 1982 the trend growth rate of the years before then.36. The main differences in domestic demand between the cases are inconsumers&apos; expenditure and investment. There are major differences in external trade prospects between the cases, arising mainly from differences in com-petitiveness. In case C, unlike cases A and B, UK costs rise faster than com-competitors&apos; and, even allowing for some depreciation of the exchange rate, com-petitiveness worsens over the period. This weaker competitiveness is reflectedpartly in a slower growth of exports, and partly in a worsened relationship between output and imports. As the projections provide for a satisfactoryexternal account the differences in the prospects for external trade in the threecases lead to differences in the growth of domestic expenditure and output.The effects of the differences in competitiveness between the three cases buildup through the period, and the divergence in the projected growth rate increases:in 1979-82 the average GDP growth for cases A, B and C are 3i per cent,21 per cent and 1$ per cent respectively.37. The limitations of these projections have already been emphasised,especially the extent to which they depend on the chosen assumptions and oninsecure econometric relationships. If the future growth in productive potentialfalls outside the range shown in table 5, the feasible growth of the economyon given assumptions for earnings and competitiveness would differ from what is shown in table 6. The present projections may understate the differences in output growth that would be associated with different rates of increasein earnings. Higher inflation would reduce growth not only through its effects on saving, investment and external trade but also because it could compela stricter fiscal policy. Case C is therefore far from being the lower end of thepossible range of GDP growth if the rise in earnings is not kept down. Similarly,case A is not put forward as the limit of feasible growth. But it docs show that to recover the rates of growth experienced before the recent recession will requirecontinued success both in reducing inflation and in improving productivity.These, together with the course of the world economy, are the essential con-straints on growth.Revenue and borrowing38. Table 7 gives projections of tax revenue and borrowing requirementswith the rise in retail prices Uuring the nrccetling calendar year.  In all ntlicrrespects the projections are based on tax legislation currently in force or an-nounced proposals to change it. The tax projections arc set alongside theexpenditure plans, expressed in cost terms at 1977-78 prices and allowing forshortfall. Fuller details of these projections are given in Part 5.General government account and public sector borrowing requirementTable 7   billion at 1977-78 pricesC)	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81General government receipts.........	58.8	59.7	61.1	62.general government expenditure ......	63.7	67.7	68.9	69.general government borrowing requirement	4.9	8.0	7.8	7.public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR)	5.5	7.3	7.2	7.0PSBR as % of GDP............	3J%	4*%	4*%	4i%(&apos;) Figures deflated by the GDP deflator at market prices.39. The projections for 1978-79 and 1979-80 are consistent with the published Industry Act forecast. For 1980-81 they are based on the assumptionthat GDP will grow by 2J per cent and that private sector expenditure willbe sufficient to produce a level of demand consistent with this growth rate.This is inevitably artificial since there can be no assurance that the extrademand would arise autonomously. If in the event the growth rate were onlyachieved by relaxing fiscal policy the borrowing requirement would be higherthan shown in the table. Subject to this important qualification, the projectionsshow that with growth as in case B tax revenues increase broadly in line withexpenditure, with revenues from the North Sea accounting for  1 billionof the rise of  4 billion in total revenues between 1977-78 and 1980-81. Withthe faster growth in case A, revenues would rise faster than expenditure; but incase C they would not keep pace.The expenditure plansMain programmes40. The allocation of expenditure between the fifteen main functional pro-grammes is shown in table 12 on page 10. The largest single programme issocial security, which absorbs about  16 billion a year and accounts for morethan one-fifth of the total. Four other main blocks of expenditure, viz education,health, housing and other environmental services, and defence, absorb  7-9billion each and together amount to about half of the total.41. There has been little change since Cmnd 7049 in the broad pattern ofexpenditure. The 1978 Budget made allocations from the contingency reserve to child benefit ( 530 million in 1979-80), employment measures ( 140 million in 1979-80) and energy conservation.

The health and personal social services programme has been increased by about  95 million in 1979-80, and by slightly smaller amounts in the two succeeding years. Otheradditions include  40-50 million a year for education, some  25 million a year for improvements in social security benefits, especially for the disabled, andamounts rising from some  5 million in 1979.80 to some  40 million in 1981-82for law and order.43.

The rates of growth of the individual programmes may be affected by subsequent allocations from the contingency reserve (see paragraph 47 below).Subject to that, the programmes for social security, health and personal social services, housing and law and order are all planned to rise in volume termsroughly in line with the expenditure total.45. The education programme shows a small rise over the period: in-creasing provision for higher and further education and for science and the arts is partly offset by decreasing provision for schools, where pupil numberswill be falling. A broadly constant level of expenditure, below that of earlier years, is planned for roads and transport. The defence budget rises by 3 per centin each of the next two years. The figures for the two subsequent years representsimply the revaluation to 1978 survey prices of the 1981-82 figure in Cmnd 7049and are consequently provisional. No decision has yet been taken about thedefence budget for those years.46. The aid programme is planned to increase by 6 per cent a year overthe next four years, and expenditure on employment services continues torise strongly up to 1981-82. The figures for the trade, industry, energy andemployment programme as a whole show little change over the planning period,the increases on the employment programme being balanced by reductions on trade and industry. The requirements for the latter arc unpredictable, andthe figures are therefore especially provisional. The provision for the energyprogramme is relatively stable over the period.The contingency reserve47. The planning totals for the years ahead include a substantial reserve to cover contingencies and other requirements which cannot be properlyquantified at this stage. About half of the total growth in expenditure plansover the next four years has been retained in the reserve, and it is expectedthat these sums will be allocated to programmes in due course. The white paper planning figures are therefore likely to understate the rates of growthfor some individual programmes.to dc nnunceo from taxation or turtlier government borrowing. Tlicy do not include payments met from interest on money lent or by provision for interestfrom trading surpluses or rents.49. On this basis the estimate for 1978-79 is  2,200 million, and showslittle change from the 1977-78 level ( 2,173 million). Debt interest is forecast to increase to  2,400 million in 1980-81 and 1981-82, and then to fall to 2,300 million in 1982-83. The estimates for 1979-80 and after are rather higher than in Cmnd 7049, reflecting the new borrowing projections in table and the recent higher rates of interest.The plans by economic category50. Table 13 gives an analysis of the present programmes by economiccategory. It does not allocate the contingency reserve between these categories,as decisions on its use have not yet been taken.51. Current expenditure accounts for around 80 per cent of total public expenditure and for rather over half of the total planned rise in expenditure over the planning period. Expenditure on goods and services and on transfer payments both contribute to the planned rise in current expenditure.52. Capital expenditure is planned to remain broadly constant over the planning period. Most of it is on construction work. Direct public expenditureon construction is planned to remain steady over the next four years, at about  5 Jbillion a year. In addition, government grants and lending help to finance otherconstruction work, for example by the nationalised industries and housing associations. Including this expenditure, the total planned level of public spending on construction amounts to a little under  7 billion a year over the survey period. A special analysis of construction expenditure is included in table5.2.53. The reduced share of capital expenditure in public expenditure as awhole mainly reflects the changing requirements of individual programmes,including demographic changes. The amount of investment needed in roads,water and power stations is now less than in the early 1970s. The requirements for new buildings in education and housing have been affected by the fallin the number of children of school age and by the shift towards gradual re-newal of the dwelling stock. The Government are concerned to avoid un-necessary fluctuations in the public sectors demand on the construction in-dustry. But decisions on the level of construction and other capital spendingmust depend primarily on how the money available for particular programmescan be used in the most cost-effective way.The plans by spending authority54. Tables 14 and 15  show public expenditure by spending authority.Further details are in Parts 4 and 5.

This expenditure by the central government accounts for a large partof the Supply voted by Parliament and other expenditure authorised under more permanent legislation. Around 60 per cent of central government voted expen-diture is subject to cash limits. The assimilation of the cash limits system withthe Parliamentary Vote system, which was announced in August, will be imple-mented over most of the field in 1979-80. This involves two main changes:the coverage of individual Votes and cash limits on expenditure covered by the votes will be brought into line; and Votes, including those for expenditure not subject to cash limits, will generally be expressed (like cash limits) at the forecastprices of the financial year to which they relate. Thus, in future Parliament willbe asked to vote these cash limits, which hitherto have been set administratively,and less need should subsequently arise for supplementary provision. The controlof expenditure will be simplified.Nationalised industries57. Table 9 gives figures for total net borrowing (other than short term)by the nationalised industries and for government lending to the industries.The former is included within the expenditure planning total and the latterwithin central government expenditure and total public expenditure. Bothsets of figures can vary substantially, even in the short term. The total borrowingfigures are derived as the difference between much larger totals which arehigly uncertain the industries&apos; capital requirements and their internalresources, which are themselves the difference between current receipts and payments.

The industries&apos; borrowing requirements are now projected at levelssubstantially below their borrowing in past years, largely as a result of the move towards economic pricing. There has also been a marked reductionsince Cmnd 7049 in the estimated requirements of the industries as a whole,despite increases in the estimated requirements for the National Coal Board,British Shipbuilders and British Airways. In aggregate the industries areexpected to continue to finance an increasing proportion of their investment programmes from their own resources. The White Paper on the nationalised industries published in April (Cmnd 7131) said that financial targets should beset for all the industries and should take into account the required rate of return on capital of 5 per cent in real terms on new investment. The processof setting financial targets on this basis (which is not yet complete) should support the movement to greater self-financing. Some of the individual industries are, however, facing serious difficulties which could have the oppositeeffect.Local authorities59. Local authorities account for over a quarter of public expenditure andfor over a half of the number of people employed full and part-time in local and central government. About 90 per cent of their expenditure is on goods and services, and more than 40 per cent is on education.Public expenditure by local authorities in Great BritainTable 10   million at 1978 survey prices	1976-77   1977-78 1978-79 estimated	1979-80 1980-81Current expenditure Education libraries and arts......

61. The rate support grant settlements for 1979-80 provide for a continuation of the modest upward trend in current expenditure. The provision for individual services has been adjusted in order to reflect more closely the actual pattern oflocal authority current expenditure. Some redistribution in the provision for capital programmes has also been made in the light of local authority decisions to spend more than expected in 1978-79 on local environmental services and less on housing.62. The Government will be discussing the implications of the plans inthis White Paper for the years after 1979-80 with the local authority associa-tions in the Consultative Councils on Local Government Finance in Englandand Wales and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities in the normal course of the next public expenditure survey.63. The definition of local authority current expenditure for White Paperpurposes differs in certain respects from &quot;relevant expenditure&quot; which is theaggregate on which the level of government grants to local authorities is basedeach year following the rate support grant discussions. For 1979-80 the per-centage of aggregate Exchequer grant has been fixed at the same level as for1978-79: that is, 61 per cent for England and Wales and 68$ per cent forScotland. Table 11 shows how &quot;relevant expenditure&quot; has been financedsince 1976-77 as between central and local sources of revenue and how theGovernment expect it will be financed next year. A reconciliation between local authority current expenditure in public expenditure survey terms and&quot;relevant expenditure&quot; is given in Part 4.Financing of local authority relevant expenditure in Great Britain(l)Table 11   million at outturn prices	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80			estimated	Total expenditure^) ............	12,630	13,718	15,470	16,927Financed by:				10,376Government grants............	8,260	8,585	9,420	Local rates and rate rebate grants......	4,680	5,372	5,8681	6,551Drawings from (4-)/additions to (-) local		- 239	4- 182J	balances etc ............	- 310			0) Excludes VAT paid by local authorities.(2) Includes a small clement of expenditure met from rates which is not relevant for grantpurposes.Devolved services64. If the devolution proposals are implemented following the referendumson 1 March 1979, the Scottish and Welsh administrations will assume respon-will be presented in separately identified public expenditure programmes.65. Part 4 includes an analysis of the devolved expenditure component of the plans in this White Paper, together with the English equivalent, reflectingthe Governments present policies for these programmes. The amounts involvedfor 1979-80 arc  3,254 million for Scotland and  1,450 million for Wales.The English equivalent figures are  22,334 million and  21,805 million respectively.Public expenditure and taxation66. In previous White Papers, references to tax have been limited to the overall balance between revenue and expenditure, and certain specific areas(like child benefit) where tax and expenditure provisions are directly related.Public expenditure however presents only part of the picture. For an improvedunderstanding of the role of fiscal policy it is necessary to look also at certain of the reliefs embodied in the taxation system. Such reliefs can have broadly the same effect on the Governments borrowing requirement as public ex-penditure. Although their distributional and incentive consequences will be different, there is a case for saying that, where a tax relief benefits a particulargroup of taxpayers, or a particular sector of the economy, it should be takeninto account along with direct public expenditure related to those taxpayersor that part of the economy.67. This &quot;tax expenditure&quot; approach has attractions, but also raisesproblems. The spectrum of tax reliefs is a very wide one, and it is necessaryfor this purpose to distinguish between reliefs which form part of the structure of the tax system, and others which have a more limited and sectoral function.It is with reliefs of the latter type that the case for consideration in conjunctionwith the relevant public expenditure provisions is the strongest. But there are many tax reliefs, in particular in the income tax and other direct taxes, whoseprimary function is as part of the tax structure as a whole. As features of thatstructure, which includes the base of the tax and the rates at which the taxis imposed, their main role is to adjust liability so as to reflect more closely the taxable capacity and special circumstances of individual taxpayers. Otherreliefs again serve a combination of taxation and specific policy objectives,or (like capital allowances) embody an element which cannot be quantified, but which would in any event enter into the proper calculation of profit.(and whichelement is the more important will often be a matter of opinion;/AIso, where a relief can be regarded as having another function than a fiscal one, it may notbe possible to relate that function to any specific area of public expenditure^1)(&apos;) A fuller discussion of this subject is given in a paper by the Treasury on &quot;The Interface ofPublic Expenditure and Taxation&quot;, given in evidence to the Expenditure Committee of theHouse of Commons and published in February 1978 (Expenditure Committee, Minutes ofEvidence, Session 1977-78, HC 196-Memoranda).
have decided that the most helpful course will be to publish a list of directtax reliefs, giving costs where these are available. This will enable parliament and the public to form their own views as to which tax reliefs should most appropriately be considered in the context of public expenditure.69. Such a list is included in table 16 on pageIV- This gives a list of the reliefsavailable in respect of Inland Revenue taxes. The list is divided into two parts:the first part contains those reliefs for which figures of cost are available, and thesecond part other reliefs, where information as to cost cannot be obtained, is notavailable at presenter is less than  1 million. In some cases where costs aregiven, the estimates made are very tentative, and may be subject to revisionin the light of later information.70. The figures are at current values and relate to the current tax year1978-79, except where otherwise stated. They are in terms of tax forgone whether by way of once-for-all reduction of liability, or of deferment of liabilityas in the case of capital etc allowances. The cost for each relief is calculatedseparately; the cost of withdrawing more than one relief cannot therefore beobtained by summing the relevant figures. Finally, in a case where withdrawalof a relief could be considered, the gain to the revenue would not necessarily be the same as the cost in the table, since the withdrawal of the relief would affectthe behaviour of taxpayers (for example in relation to the reliefs for savings) orthe amounts of payments (for example the supplementary benefits might needadjustment to take account of the tax liability).71. The table covers only Inland Revenue taxes. The Government havedecided not to include other taxes although it might be suggested that a similarapproach could be adopted for these taxes also. However, with indirecttaxes the problems of selectivity and measurement as well as their assignmentto particular government programmes are no less complex and difficult to resolve. There are some features of the indirect tax system where estimates of tax foregone can be made with reasonable confidence: in the case of zerorated goods and services, for example, or for the value of the hydro-carbonoil duty rebates made to selective categories of consumers, like the horticulture-cultural users. But there is a further major difficulty. In the area of the indirecttaxes it is also possible to envisage the concept of &quot;tax penalties&quot; that istax charges which are imposed primarily for policy reasons rather than simply to provide revenue. An obvious example is the surcharge imposed on highertar cigarettes by the 1978 Finance Act. Other indirect taxes may be seen asserving more than one purpose. For example, the White Paper on transportpolicy1 noted that the specific transport taxes contribute to the general revenue and also serve as a form of price system to charge users for the resources which government puts into the roads system.(&apos;) Transport policy, Cmnd 6836, June 1977; paragraphs 48-52.
