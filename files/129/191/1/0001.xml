DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government cp(76) 51 81COPY NO23 July 1976CABINETUNEMPLOYMENT AMONG YOUNG PEOPLEMemorandum by the Secretary o  State for Prices and consumer Protection and Paymaster general.        At the request of the Prime Minister I chaired a meeting ofMinisters to consider a package of proposals by the Secretary of Statefor Employment for action in response to the growing problem ofunemployment among young people.    A summary of the case and theproposals which he put before the Group is attached at Annex A.    Thismemorandum sets out the conclusions of the meeting on the suitability ofthe proposals for an announcement this month - the Secretary of State for employment proposes that this should be made so as to coincide with thepublication of the July unemployment figures on 20 July.RECRUITMENT OF SCHOOL LEAVERS (Paragraph 6 of Annex A)2.        The Group endorsed the proposal to replace the existing  5Recruitment Subsidy for School Leavers by a subsidy of  10 per week,payable for 6 months, for the recruitment of anybody under the age of20 who had been unemployed for at least 6 months.    The scheme would run for 6 months from 1 October 1976 and would apply to applicationsmade by 3i March 1977.    The Group took the view however, that it shouldbe made clear that consideration should be given to a subsequent extensionof the life of the scheme to 31 July 1977 so as to cover those leaving schoolin December 1976 which particularly affects Scotland and Northern Ireland.The estimated cost to 31 March is  4.4 million, of which  1.7 million would fall in 1976-77 and  2.7 million in 1977-78.EXPANSION OF TRAINING PLACES FOR YOUNG PERSONS(Paragraph 7 of Annex A)3. The Group endorsed the proposal that the Training Services Agency(TSA) should expand from 7, 000 to 10, 000 the number of places availablefor young people.    They would also be encouraged to give preference inallocating places to those at present registered as unemployed.   these changes would involve no increase in expenditure.1
WORK EXPERIENCE COURSES (paragraphs 8 and 9 of Annex A)4.        The Group expressed support in principle for the outline proposalfor work experience courses through which young persons would obtainexperience of life in industry.    The scheme has so far not been developed in any detail by the Manpower Services Commission, and theGroup considered that a good deal more work was necessary before itcould be adopted.    Specific points to be developed are -a. the need to increase the training content, both on its ownmerit and to attract finance from the e.c..    The implicationof this for local authorities facilities will, however, needexamination;b. the interaction between this proposal and the scheme toencourage recruitment of young people unemployed for 6 months or more;c. the length of courses;d. it would also be valuable to have work experience coursesproviding an introduction to work in the social services sector.The Group did not consider it likely that such a scheme could be agreed for announcement in an early package but tta Secretary of State for employment will be pursuing the scheme with the Manpower services commission in the hope that an early announcement can be made.MANDATORY EDUCATIONAL MAINTENANCE ALLOWANCES-fgajagTB^fa-i^Haf-Aapaat A)5.        The Group considered as a possible component of an early packagea proposal already put before the Social Services Committee (SA) by doeSecretaries of State for Education and Science and for Wales for a mandatory scheme of educational maintenance allowances (EMA) so as toreduce the number of registered unemployed among the young by encouraging them to stay in education.    The Group concluded that since this would require legislation for its implementation and would be apermanent change it was not appropriate to a short term package, but should continue to be examined by SA as an educational measure.JOB SWAP SCHEME (Paragraph 117of Annex A)6. There was support in principle for a scheme for payment of an allowance to 64 year old men and 59 year old women until normalretirement on condition that they withdraw from the labour force, and on condition that their employer recruited someone from the unemploymentregister.    There were, however, also serious reservations on a numberof points.    While he estimated the gross cost of payment of allowances at
 110 million the Secretary of State for Employment put the net cost at 21 million because of the saving of unemployment and supplementary benefit payments to those brought into employment.    Considerable doubt was expressed whether the offsetting savings would reduce the gross costac much as this, and whether the replacement job condition could beprop-.My enforced.    Other points on which concern was expressed were -a. by offering payment for early retirement across the boardit might add to pressure for other concessions on retirementeg for special schemes for early retirement in industriesinvolving especially arduous work;b. to introduce tax free payments for this purpose mightcreate distortions and add to pressure for oilier benefits tobe relieved from tax;c. there might be advantage in limiting the scheme eitherto the assisted areas or to firms which were not reducingemployment overall;d. it was unfair to allow all consequential savings to be offset against the cost of this proposal but not other proposalswhich might reduce unemployment.The Group considered that the difficulties raised should be studied as amatter of urgency, and would be ready to consider any further proposalswhich might be put forward which took account of the points made in discussion.    It was not, however, able to recommend the present proposalto the Cabinet.conclusion. The Group recommended to the Cabinet for incorporation in anearly package the proposed changes in the scheme for subsidy of the recruitment of the young (paragraph 2) and the increase in the provisionof training places to the young (paragraph 3).    These measures willprovids jobs w draining places for 15, 000 young people moat of whom willhave experienced long periods of unemployment, but most of this wouldbe at the expense of reducing job opportunities for other unemployed workers.    The net increase in public expenditure would be  4.4 million ofwhich  1.7 million would be in 1976-77 and the remainder in 1977-78.The Group would be ready to consider further the proposal for a &quot;JobSwap&quot; scheme but cannot recommend the scheme as proposed at present.The Group also believes that the proposal for work experience schemesincluding the social services should be further studied as a matter of urgency.S w department of Prices and Consumer Protection13 July 1976
annex AUNEMPLOYMENT AMONG YOUNG people.    The unemployment figures on 20 July are likely to show a rise generally(seasonally adjusted and excluding school leavers) and a sharp increase in thetotal of unemployed school leavers to around 200)000,   By October there could still be 150,000 young people unemployed (about half of them school leavers) and about 100,000 even by December.2.     This is after taking account of the impact during this aotumn of the existingmeasures such as the school leaver recruitment subsidy, the job creation programme and expanded training schemes.   But for these the number of unemployed young peopleunder 18 in October might stand 50,000 higher than the 150,000 estimated above.3.     This is not just a problem of this year&apos;s chool leavers.   More young peopleremain unemployed for longer than previously; last April some 21,000 of lastyear&apos;s school leavers were still registered as unemployed, the largest figuresince the war.   The less able and unqualified young people suffer particularlybadly.*v.     Employers can be expected as usual to take on this autumn the better qualifiedschool leavers.   A recent private manpower survey suggested that banks and insurance companies, among others, were expecting to take on more school leavers this year than last.   Help therefore needs to be directed to the less able and unqualified,particularly those who have remained unemployed for some time, and preferably toget them into genuine jobs or training or otherwise into some form of work experience.5.     With this in view the Secretary of State for Employment proposes government support for 5 measures specifically directed towards the young unemployed andone - a job swap scheme - which would open Job opportunities to them as to others.Subsidy for Long Term Unemployed6.    His first proposal is to replace the existing  5 school leaver recruitment subsidyby a subsidy of  10 for those under the age of 20 who have been unemployed for atleast 6 months.   The scheme would run from the beginning of October for a 6 month period and the subsidy would be paid for each individual for 6 months afteremployment.   On this basis the cost of the scheme would be &amp;%h million of which 2.? million would fall in the current financial year.   The subsidy would be paidin respect of 27,000 young persons of whom 12,000 would be additional to the normaloutflow from the category of those unemployed for 6 months or more.   The scheme
could not be expected to create many new jobs but rather to get long-term unemployedyoung people taken on in preference to other unemployed workers.   There is therefore no substantial offsetting saving in unemployment benefit, but since the existingschool leaver recruitment subsidy would be closed for new applications from the date the new scheme is introduced that would save  1 million in the current financialyear.Expansion of Training7-     The second proposal is to expand the number of training places available for young persons (outside the apprenticeship field) from the present TSA target of ,000 to 10,000.   The MSC would intend to achieve this if they are not subjected tospending cuts from within existing financial provision by switching resourceswithin the TOPS programme towards young people.Work Experience and Training Courses8.     The third proposal is to give Government financial support to a scheme thatthe MSC and CBI are working out for providing work experience courses for asubstantial number of unemployed young persons, especially school leavers.   TheChairman of the MSC has spoken to Lord Watkinscn, who has promised the CBI&apos;s fullbacking, and suggested enlisting intially the support of the 100 largest companies in laying on within their plants work experience courses which would run for aperiod of 6 months to one year-   Recruitment would be restricted to unemployedschool leavers and to other unemployed persons in the age group 16-18 who would benefit from an opportunity to learn more   about the world of work.   The programme would be designed to give an introduction to working life wibhf wherever possible,further educational. training opportunities built in.   Recruits would be regardedas trainees and paid allowances linked to the TSA training rates, in all say 16 a week.   The allowances would not be liable to income tax and national insurance contributions would be credited free.   The employer would pay the allowances and be re-imbursed monthly in arrears.   He would bear the costs of arranging the courses and bearing any overhead costs such as materials.9-     The aim would be to provide courses for 30,000 young people at a gross costof  19 million, against which there would be offsetting savings of unemploymentbenefit etc of  9 million.   This includes the cost of possibly 60 extra staffneeded by the MSC to run the scheme.   The main recruiting season would he inOctober and November and  6.3 million of the gross cost would fall in the current financial year.   It might be possible to recover 50 per cent of the net cost from
the e.c. Social Fund. The scheme would hove to have the support of the OTC whowill be particularly concerned to ensure that work experience opportunities donot jeopardise permanent jobs. The Chairman of the MSG is taking this up withthe TtfC.Job Swap Scheme10.   The final proposal is for a job swap scheme.   As so far proposed this would ottera tax free allowance of possibly  20 a week to 6V year old men (to age 65) and59 year old women (to age 60) on condition th&apos;t they withdraw from the labour market-(The precise size of the allowance has still to be settled.)   The scheme would feeopen to persons in employment or signing the unemployment register and it would bea condition of access to the scheme that the employer must replace the worker soreleased by a younger person from the unemployment register.   Most of the jobswould go to experienced workers rather than to. young people, but the scheme could still be expected to open up opportunities to them as well.   Around 113,000 menand women would leave the unemployment register at a gross cost of  110 millionwith a very much lower net cost in public expenditure terras estimated at 21 million.   The scheme would need legislation but might be started in advanceunder the Appropriation Act and arrangements made to bring it into operation by theend of October.    It would need an extra 125 staff to run.   The costs could ofcourse be reduced in various ways eg by running the scheme for 6 months- insteadof a year and/or by restricting its application so to the development areas.   Theformer variation would halve the cost and the latter would reduce it by 75 per cent.11.   The attached table sets out in summary form the impact and costs of each ofthe above proposals.Announcement12.   The Secretary of State for Employment has proposed that these measures shouldbe announced on 20 July when the unemployment figures are published and that thestatement should urge young people to continue in further education rather thanenter the labour market at this particularly difficult juncture.ji?1I3
