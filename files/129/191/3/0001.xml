I -    TAX CHANGES IN 1977-783.     We are not concerned here with changes in the level oftaxation or expenditure affecting the current year.    Our taxationproposals have already been put forward in the Budget and theFinance Bill.    On expenditure we have said that we will not cut the planned total this year hut that we will not allow it to be exceeded;this may require some reductions to offset increases in particularprogrammes, with no net change in the total.4.      It is on 1977-78 that we now have to take new decisions.    TheChancellor has proposed that we should announce our objective of reducing the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement over the next threeyears,  starting in 1977-78.    Action to achieve this can take the formboth of reductions in planned expenditure and of tax changes.    Theexpenditure decisions have to be taken well in advance, because ofthe longer gestation period involved.   This is particularly so wherethe measures have to be carried out by other bodies, mainly the localauthorities and nationalised industries, but even for the preparationof departmental Estimates a substantial period of preparationis required.5.     We should therefore have to start taking our expendituredecisions now in any case.    The special feature of the situation isthat, though we have resisted pressures to make arbitrary cuts beforecompletion of the public expenditure Survey, it is now a matter of urgency to take and announce our initial decisions on the Surveyaffecting 1977-78.6.     The objective of reducing the borrowing requirement next year will mean that, to the extent that expenditure reductions prove to be insufficient for this purpose, the further adjustment requiredwill have to take the form of tax measures.2
7.     The effects which fiscal action to reduce the borrowing requirement produces on the level of economic activity, and thereforeon such things as employment and the balance of payments, tend -allowing for the margins of error in all these things - not to divergevery radically over a period of time, whether the reduction is broughtabout by a general reduction in expenditure or a general increase in taxation.   But the particular method adopted can make a difference,especially to the timing and incidence of these effects.   When itconies to the effects on the retail price index and on real take homepay, the choice of method can make a very big difference indeed.8.     Expenditure reductions of  1,000   million at 1976 Survey pricesinvolve a bigger expenditure amount in 1977-78 out-turn prices,but probably something less than  1,000 million in terras of reducingthe 1977-78 borrowing requirement, after allowing for lower taxrevenue and increased outgoings on social security.    The expenditure/borrowing ratio will depend on the composition of the package.A  1,000 million expenditure package (in Survey prices) could be constructed from the list under consideration which would reducethe borrowing requirement in 1977-78 by  700-900 million, depending on the package.9.     There is only one cut listed for decision which would have anynoticeable effect on the RPI, that is, the  200 million saving in1977-78 through a faster phasing out of food subsidies;    this wouldhave an RPI effect of An increase in prescription charges,if decided upon, would have an insignificant RPI effect, while dentaland optical charges do not affect the RPI at all.10.    The list does not include any further reduction in housing subsidies, but the effects of the reduction in these subsidies whichwould flow from our existing White Paper decisions, in conjunctionwith the White Paper decisions on school meals and food subsidies,would affect the RPI to the extent of a little over $6, which hasII - EFFECTS ON EMPLOYMENT AND THE RPI
already been allowed for  in our RPI forecasts.       There  are  additionalbids  for  decision which,   if approved,  would reduce  this  effect.11.      The temporary addition to unemployment resulting from the wholepackage of  1,000 million,  if confined to  1977-78 on a once-for-all basisiwould  tend to build up to  a maximum of perhaps 75,000 as  compared with what it would otherwise be the first half of 1978, but total unemployment should be  coming  down well before then.       The  different  elements  in the package  would have  different  effects.       For example,   if the  cuts were concentrated on building programmes,   a high proportion of this  effect would naturally fall upon the construction industry.      Reductions initems  such as mortgage  lending  or municipalisation,   or a postponement of payment  of regional  development grants,  would have  little  effect  onunemployment.12.       If additional bids were  approved which reduced the  total net  saving on expenditure and the borrowing requirement,  they would pro tanto abatethese effects.      If the additional bids were to exceed the reductions,thus increasing planned expenditure,  this would increase the borrowing requirement and the balance of payments deficit.13.      For comparison, the following table shows the effects on the borrowing requirement  and on the RPI  and  on unemployment  of a numberof illustrative tax changes,  each of which would yield,  at  I977-.78prices additional revenue in the region of  500-6oOmillion,  and would reduce the borrowing requirement by  300-350 million.      As in the caseof expenditure measures the effects of particular taxes,  for instance,  onunemployment - in any case subject to a substantial margin of uncertai nty- will differ,  especially as regards timing.l4.      The comparison indicates that a bigger gross revenue packageis needed to secure a given cut in the public sector borrowing requirementand that such a cut, if achieved by reductions in public expenditure ofthe kind illustrated, would have a much smaller effect on the RPI than a cut of the same amount achieved by increases in taxes.      The expendituremethod would also tend to produce a smaller effect on unemployment.
The right  time  to make  these  tax changes  is  in the Spring  1977Budget.       It will not be possible until next Spring to decide how much has to be done,  and it also makes sense to decide then whichparticular tax changes should be used.      Otherwise we should ben.  li months before they are due to takeannouncing  tax increases  eight monine jeffect,  and without knowing whether the total of the tax increases is right.       If Cabinet agree to a  9 billion PSBR target,  even with aH-f+nt-n    if it were decided the balance 1 billion  cut  in public  expenditure,   nLJ.   .     . ^        -   j - tM increases it would be necessary,  formust be obtained from indirect tax i&quot;&quot;0u An above,  to go for a combination of twothe reasons given in paragraph li apove,   i,or more of the items in the attached table.

The illustrative tax increases are put as near  500m of revenue yield asadministrative possibilities allow (eg the VAT step has in practice to bre from 896-10%).2.   The PSBR impact from particular tax measures is less than the revenue yield from those measures first, because of time lags;   and second, because a lower GDP (whether resulting from tax increases or public expenditurereductions) produces a lower tax yield across the whole field of taxation,while public expenditure - eg. on Bocial security benefits - increases and hence swells the PSBR.3.   Use of the employers&apos; National Insurance contribution would require autumnlegislation which would also have to make the proceeds available for generalrevenue by diverting them from the National Insurance Fund.This estimate excludes receipts in respect of employees in the non-trading public sector.SECRET
III  - BILATERAL CONSULTATIONS15.      I have held meetings with the Ministers responsible for the spending programmes which make up the bulk of public expenditure.    this programme of consultations has naturally had to be highly compressed andI am grateful to my colleagues for their help in fitting in with the timetable.    These discussions have helped to clarify the issues and produce a closer assessment of what is realisable in particular cases,and I am able to report agreement on some few particular proposals.For the most part, however,  the main issues remain to be resolvedcollectively.16.      I must remind my colleagues that in my previous paper I posedtwo general issues - whether we exclude the main social security benefits from the reductions,  and whether we content ourselves withobserving the existing White Paper figures for local authority current expenditure rather than go below these.    If we do this we reduce thetotal public expenditure programmes available for savings  ( 53^ billionat 1976 Survey Prices) by  ll  billion in respect of social security and  lo  billion for local authority current expenditure: we wouldhave to secure the reductions over a smaller area of public expenditure.Defence17.&apos;     I believe that we should seek the full reduction of S,lkO million which I suggested in my previous paper.    But the Defence Secretaryconsiders this saving to be unattainable without fundamental consequences for our defence policy.Overseas Aid18.      In the case of the Aid Programme I am prepared to scale down myappraisal of the reduction which could be obtained without breakingcommitments or near-commitments.    I now consider that  50 million can and should be secured by this means.    But the Minister for overseas development considers that as a matter of principle and moral obligationthere should be no cut in this programme.    This is a clear politicalissue which can only be resolved collectively.
Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry19.       I have proposed that the additional bids of  9 million should be off-set by implementing in full the policy options setout in the PESO report; and that there should be further savings of  25 million.   These further savings could, I suggest, comprise:a reduction of  3 million in forestry expenditure (eg through an embargo on land purchases); a cut of  3 million in R &amp; D expenditure;    Iand a deferral of the payment of capital grants and (if necessary)other agricultural grants and subsidies.    The Minister of Agriculturehas taken note of these proposals and is considering them with hisagricultural colleagues.20.      I remain of the opinion that it would be feasible to securetotal net savings of  25 million by these or other means.Food Subsidies21.       The proposal in CP(76)42 was a faster phasing out of the foodsubsidy programme to save  200 million.   The Secretary of State believe^ithat this rate of rundown would be unacceptable given the reductionsalready made in the 1975 White Paper, the sharp increases in pricesof essential foodstuffs arising for other reasons, eg, under EECtransitional arrangements, and the bunching of increases at acritical period of the 4$&amp; pay policy.   The most she felt able toaccept was a reduction of  50 million.i22.      We have already agreed to phase out food subsidies.   Significantprice increases are unavoidable and advancing rundown by a year would of itself add only about      to the HPI over 1977-78.   To provide some    *greater room for manoeuvre, however, in the programme of reductionsI propose that the saving on the Secretary of State&apos;s programme shouldbe in the range of  150- 200 million-provided that sufficient savingsare identified elsewhere to make up the target total.
Energy23.      Hie main problem here is BHOC, for which there was no provisionbeyond 1976-77 in Cmnd 6393.   BHOCe existing commitments amount to 167 million, and the Secretary of State considers that  30 million should be added to this to cover new requirements which cannot yet be identified.   Against this excess of  197 million, the Secretaryof State has undertaken to consider, with the Chairmen of the nationalised energy industries and of the sea, whether cuts of upto  100 million can be made in their existing programmes.   Any other possible requirements for MOO above the  197 million would count aspotential claims against the contingency reserve.   In addition, I haveagreed with him that his additional bid for British Nuclear FuelsLimited ( 32.6 million) should be dropped, on the understanding thatthe company can borrow from the banking sector to finance its develop-ment; and that one small additional item of  1.8 million already approved by Ministers should be added to his programme.   I have asked him to see whether his other additional bids totalling  34.4 millioncan be offset by savings within his programme or those of the national-ised energy industries.Industry24.      Additional bids, under Programme 4, total some  19 million.   Ofthis figure, some  9.4 million including the bulk of the Concordeprovision, seem unavoidable.   A further  9*2 million reflects a forecast increase in payment of regional development grant.   TheSecretary of State has offered savings of  1 million in the Concordeprovision and  4 million on fi &amp; D expenditure, and has suggested areduction of  10 million on the provision for selective assistance and minor rescues under Section 7 of the Industry Act.   Beyond this he has indicated readiness to contemplate some savings through deferralof payment and reduced industrial coverage of regional developmentgrant ( 30 million).
25.      I welcome the savings offered on Concorde and R&amp;D but since those suggested on Section 7 are largely in the nature of estimating changes, I would only score  5 million under this head.As regards regional development grants I propose net savings of 120 million primarily in the form of deferred payment, the detains to &quot;be settled in agreement with the Secretary of State.26. Provision of  64 million is proposed under Programme 5 forBritish Shipbuilders ( 56 million) and British Aerospace ( 8 million).The Secretary of State would be prepared to accept a reduction of 6 million. Given the uncertainties in this area at this stage, andthe absence of a corporate plan, I suggest that the programme provision should be limited to schemes already in progress plus essential renewalsand stocks. On this basis I propose a provision of  55 million (including 2 million for British Aerospace), leaving any further provision necessaryto be borne on the contingency reserve.27.       The Secretary of State has offered savingB of  40 million from the British Steel Corporation and the Post Office.Trade .28.       The additional bids appear unavoidable but the Secretary ofState is prepared to make savings of  5 million from the programme for tourism, export promotion, and assistance to the film industry.He has agreed that the investment programmes of British Airways andthe British Airports Authority should be cut by a total of  15 million.Employmentamount29.       Additional bids on these programmesAo  94 million, includingthe equalisation of men and women&apos;s rates of REP at  5 (costing 35 million), the collective funding of apprentice training ( JO million)and miscellaneous items ( 29 million).
S   C BE T50,       I proposedin CP(76)42 a net saving of  50 million, byequalising BEP at  2 a week after eliminating or offsetting theother additional bids and accepting the 2 % options offered.   OnREP I now propose a larger saving of about  80 million net byequalising the mens and womens rates of REP at  ? in SpecialDevelopment Areas only (costing  17 million) and abolishing itin Development Areas (saving about  100 million).   This can bedone by Statutory Order.31.      On the other items the Secretary of State offered to reduce expenditure on collective funding in. 1977-78 to  15 million; and to save  18 million by reducing the employers&apos; rebate on redundancy payments from 50^ to 40%, and  15 million by transferring part ofthe administrative costs of industrial training boards (ITBs) to employers.   The last two items would require legislation, and theMSG would need to be consulted on. ITBs and collective funding.   1still consider that the whole of the additional bids should be offset, which could be done by a further transfer of ITB expenseson the costs of collective funding to employers, bringing the totalsaving on either of those iteme to  26 million.Roads and TransportEngland32.      If the Government and local authorities imposed a moratoriumon the construction of all new roads in England for one year, the savings would be  240 million, of which  150 million would come   fromthe programme for motorways and trunk roads and the other  90 million from local roads.   The Secretary of State for the Environment isprepared to impose a moratorium on the construction of new roads bylocal authorities which would save the  90 million but he will needthat sum to cover the prospective overspending by English localauthorities mainly on concessionary fares and on revenue support.The Secretary of State is also prepared to offer savings of  40 million by imposing a moratorium on the construction of new trunk roads in categories III and IV,   He would therefore be providing net savings on roads and transport of  40 million.   I realise the economic
disadvantage of a larger cut, but I think we should seek somesavings on the construction of trunk roads in categories I and ii as well and about a 10 per cent reduction in expenditure ontrunk road maintenance.   Together these measures could produce afurther  55 million and that would still leave a programme of 80 million for new trunk roads.   I therefore propose a net saving on this programme of  75 million.Scotland33.     The Secretary of State for Scotland is willing to take10 per cent of whatever total cut on roads is agreed for thecountry aB a whole and I therfore propose a net saving on this programme of  8 million.Wales34.       The Secretary of State for Wales is not prepared to offersavings of more than  2 million because of the need to completeconstruction of the M4 motorway.   I consider however that, as histotal programme for motorways   and trunk roads is  59 million, heshould.be able to take a cut of  4 million.35.       Thus I propose a total reduction in this programme of 87 million.Surface Transport Industries36.       The Secretary of State for the Environment has said that the investment programmes of the minor surface transport industriescould be reduced by  5 million if there is a general cut in nationalised industry investment and if the saving can be used to offset additionalgrant needed for the National Freight Corporation
40. The Secretary of State for Vales considers that the Surveyfigures for housing in Vales should be increased by  78 million toSECRETHousingEngland.yj.      On the latest information about local authoritiy expendi-ture and views of feasible rent incre&amp;a&amp;a in 1977-78, and treadsin housing approvals, there is a prospective overspend in 1977-78of at least  250 million.   Of this, about  150 million would be on new housebuilding, and  100 million on housing subsidies.   TheSecretary of State has indicated that he is willing to imposeimmediate control on the new housebuilding programme, which isnow open-ended, and to cut the rate or approvals by local authorities from its present level of about 10,000 a month to around 6,000 to7,000 a month.   This would avoid the prospective overspend on this item.   In addition, the Secretary of State is willing to find savings of  100 million (gross? on local authority lending, amnicipaiisation,and improvement work.?8-      Moreover, if it proves possible to persuade the building societies and banks to replace or refinance a substantial partof local authority lending, he night be able to increase substantially the savings of  100 million feross).   While rejecting the idea of abolishing improvement grants by legislation, he is prepared tosee what savings can be achieved by administrative means.   unless a significant contribution can be obtained from these two sources,there would still be no net reduction.Scotland39.      If a net reduction ia made in this programme for GreatBritain as a whole, the Secretary of State for Scotland is willingto make a proportionate reduction  in, expenditure,;and to introducecontrol over new housebuilding, iu Scotland.Wales
take account of recent trends in housing approvals, and a proposed increase in improvements, municipalisation and mortgagelending.    If the Survey figures were so increased, he would beprepared to contribute proportionately to any net reduction forGreat Britain as a whole and to introduce control over new house-building in Wales.Great Britain41. To reach a target of  1 billion, however, I believe we musthave a substantial net saving from this programme, at least of theorder of  3-400 million.Other Environmental Services42.      Tne Secretary of State for the Environment does not agree tocute in the community land scheme, but is examining the scope forcuts in capital expenditure of local authorities and regionalwater authorities.   The Secretaries of State for Scotland and wales would be prepared to make proportionate cuts in their programmes.4J.      For Great Britain as a whole it still seems reasonable to seek net savings of  100 million.Law, Order and Protective Services44.      In Home Office services, the additional bids for England andWales amount to  21 million.   The Home Secretary has indicated thathe is prepared to absorb  16 million for inescapable commitments,and to withdraw  4 million of bids for items of lower priority.   Thebid of  1 million for the urban programme can he left for laterdecision.   In Scotland, the additional bids amount to  8 million.Of this,  5 million can be treated in the same way as the Home Officebids.   The remaining  3 million is for local authority current expenditure and will fall to be considered in that context.
45. la view of the savings required to offset inescapableincreases I am not now suggesting an overall net cut in this programme, although a modest net saving might need to be consideredif sufficient savings cannot be found elsewhere.46.      On the remainder of this programme, it should be possiblefor the Lord Chancellor&apos;s additional bids to be fully offset; andthe Minister of Agriculture is prepared to withdraw his bid for thefood stockpile.   No provision need be made at this stage for the contingent bid for Rhodesian refugees.Education and Libraries, Science and Arts47.      Some four-fifths of this programme consists of local authoritycurrent expenditure.   Some of the &quot;policy options&quot; affecting that expenditure will be needed to offset the additional bids of  41 million and to reduce a prospective excess on local authority current expenditure generally; thus they cannot be scored as a contributionto a net saving.48.      I therefore discussed three matters with the Secretary ofState for Education and Science;(i)   Additional bid for school mealsWe have undertaken to the TOC that the present schoolmeal charge of 1?p will not be raised during this financial year.   To keep to the expenditure figures inCmud 6593 for 1977-76 the charge would have to be raisedby 9p in April 1977; or by 12p in September 1977; or by5p in April 1977 aad a further Sp in the followingSeptember.   The Secretary of State could recommend onlyone increase of 5p in September 1977&apos;* the consequenceof this is an additional bid of  43 million (GB).   It isfor consideration whether charges should be raised to offset this bid in whole or in part.   A single increaseof 10p in September 1977 would reduce the additional bidto about  15 million.   The charge would then have remained unchanged for 2$ years.   The current cost of a school weal.SECRET
is 42p.   Net expenditure on school meals (excludingfree meals) is running at  285 million a year,(ii) Net savings on education and librariesThe Secretary of State is prepared to offer savings of  25 million mainly by reducing expenditure onuniversity furniture and equipment, and on computers.I think it should be possible to save a further  23million by slowing down the growth in the number of full-time students in higher education and limiting the building starts programmes for 1977-78 to those required to meet basic needs for additional places in primary and secondary schools.   I should look fora corresponding saving of  2 million from the comparableScottish programmes, bringing the net saving on education and libraries to  50 million.(Hi) Net savings on science and artsThe Secretary of State for Education and Science isprepared to offer  4 million on this part of the programme&apos;I still consider that it should be possible to makesavings of  8 million on science and  2 million on the artsprogramme, making a total of  10 million.Health and Personal Social Services49.       The discussion with the Secretary of 6tate for Social Servicescovered:-(i)   charges the Secretary of State is ready to raise  20 million(GB) by increasing dental and optical charges (thoughthe Scots reserved their position)   This would involvecharging in full for the supply and dispensing of lensesand a rise in the flat rate charge for dental treatmentfrom  3.50 to  6, as well as increases in denture charged&apos;
Prescription charges were also discussed, and Imay wish to come back to this if the overall savingscannot be secured in other ways.(ii) Capital expenditure the Secretary of State is unwilling to see reductions,although the Scots would prefer this to raising charges.yearAn immediate one/moratorium on all new starts on the health programme would save  35 million (GB) and reduced allocations for minor works should also bepossible.   I believe a saving of  30 million on the health side would be reasonable, and  10 million on the personal social services capital programme.   These areGB figures and each country would contribute its share.(iii) Current ExpenditureShe Secretary of state is not willing to consider any reduction.   There is an additional bid of  12 million for the Jubilee holiday, and health authorities arealready committed to offset the additional cost of the junior hospital doctors&apos; contract.   These additionalcosts should be absorbed and some savings may also bepossible on research.   No prospect is seen of securingany reduction in current expenditure on local authoritypersonal social services.(iv) Levy on Motor Insurers for Road Accident costs the Secretary of State proposed the introduction ofa statutory levy on motor insurers to cover the fullcosts of NHS treatment arising from traffic accidentsto yield  40 million in 1977-78.   I agree that thisshould be looked at in detail but no feasible proposals have been worked out and it would not be realistic to count on any yield from this in 1977-78.
Social Security50.     Additional bids of.  1J4 million arise from changes indemographic factors and economic assumptions.   These arema ulcersunavoidable but I discussed the following/with the Secretary ofState(i) Mobility allowance.An additional bid of  2 million arises from proposals to extend eligibility and uprate the allowance to 7 in November 1977 (and by prices at 2 yearly intervals thereafter).   The Secretary of Stateagreed to offset the costs of extension by   slowing down the take-on programme but is unwilling however to withdraw the uprating bid.   Even though, with slowerphasing, this might now cost little or nothing extrain 1977-78, I must oppose it in view of the substantialadditions that would arise in later years.(ii) Non-contributory invalidity pension for housewives.This is due to be introduced in 1977-78, though thereis no precise commitment to a date in that year.   TheSecretary of State is prepared to consider postponingintroduction to about half way through that year, savingsome  10 million.   I think it should be possible to double this saving by postponing introduction untilthe end of the year.(iii) Unemployment benefit for occupational pensioners.to be Secretary of State is prepared to include in theSocial Security Amendment Bill early next sessiona provision to restrict unemployment benefit foroccupational pensioners.   The reduction would affectthose with occupational pensions over, say,  25 andmight save about  10 million in 1977-78 (twice asmuch in a full year).   We are agreed on the merits of
this proposal and I recommend that it shouldbe adopted and an early announcement made.Assistance to Poorer Energy Consumers51-     There is an additional bid for  25 million (of which some 10 million would fall in 1977-78)       a package of measures tohelp poor consumers next winter.   I have discussed this with boththe Secretary of State for Energy and the Secretary of State for social Services.   Since neither is prepared to sponsor the scheme in his programme or to find offsetting savings for it, I recommendthat the proposal should now be dropped.Scotland52.     For the generality of programmes, the Secretary of state will accept reduction on the lines of those agreed for the restof the country.   However, he does wish to retain flexibility aboutpriorities in expenditure.   He accepted that the open-ended natureof the house-building programme should be ended and thought thatsavings could be found in the housing programme.   For local authoritycurrent expenditure, he argued that an extra  22 million is necessaryto maintain Cmnd 6593 policies affecting this expenditure in 1976-77;without this, he said a painful readjustment of policies would berequired.   Of course, this applies to the rest of the UK as well.I cannot therefore recommend acceptance of additional expenditure here.Scottish Nationalised industries55*     Following my meeting with the Secretary of State officials&apos;are to examine the possibility of reducing the investment programmes of the Scottish nationalised industries by  10 million.Wales54. Apart from the bousing and roads programmes, the Secretaryof State will make reductions equivalent to those agreed for therest of the UK.   While he accepts that the open-ended nature of
the housing programme should be ended, he feels that the base-linefor housing in Wales is too low and that it should be increasedby some  80 million before net reductions are made comparable tothose in England and Scotland.   For roads he is concerned aboutprogress on the M4 and has only offered savings of  2 million again**the  5 million Which I have sought.     As indicated in paragraph 3*iabove I believe the savings here should be  k million.
IV ADDITIONAL BIDS -REARRANGEMENT OF PRIORITIES55.    I understand very well the point of view that, even when wehave to restrict or reduce public expenditure as a whole, it shouldbe possible to find room for extra expenditure on programmes ofspecial priority, and that general reductions may be politicallymore acceptable if they can be accompanied by some particularincreases of this kind.    The practical difficulties of giving effect to this will be different In 1977-78 from those with whichwe have to deal in the current year.56.   In planning ahead for 1977-78* if we set ourselves a target for reducing the planned total of expenditure! we can deal with proposals for additions to the Survey programmes In one of thefollowing ways:-(a) Decide on gross reductions going beyond the target figure, so that some additional bids can be approvedwhile still securing the target figure of net reductions.(b) Approve additional bids now as claims on the contingency reserve for 1977-78* thus reducing the size of the contingency reserve for that year.(c) Withhold approval from additional bids now, on the basis that they can be considered as potential claims againstthe contingency reserve in the course of 1977-78 itself,according to the state of the contingency reserve atthat time,57,    I should see great difficulties over courses (b) or (c). sinceeven now, nine months before the beginning of the next financial year,the contingency reserve for 1977-76 has already been substantiallydepleted.     It is at present reduced rather below the amount for thecorresponding year in the last public expenditure White Paper(Cmnd 6393).    To publish anything lower than that.as a contingency reserve would not carry conviction.    Equally, to leave a largeoverhang of proposals as potential claims on the contingency reservewould be courting the risk of publishing a plan and not being ableSBCRST
to  stick to it.    I conclude therefore in favour of course  (a),  iethat we must only approve additional bids to the extent that theycan be balanced by additional gross reductions yielding our nettarget reduction in planned expenditure compared with the lastWhite Paper,  and that potential claims on the contingency reserves should be kept to a minimum.58.      One suggestion put to me in the course of the bilateral discussions was that we should make a proportionate percentage cut in all programmes across the board,  excluding social security,  where our freedom of action is limited by our statutory commitments,  andexcluding local authority current expenditure,  for reasons with whichwe are now familiar.    As indicated in paragraph 16,  these exclusionsconsiderably reduce the total from which savings can be made,  andin order to achieve a net reduction of  1,000 million on the remainder of public expenditure by a standard percentage cut, we should have,not merely to reject all additional bids or require them to be absorbed, but to scale all the programmes concerned down by over J%.If the programmes of industrial expenditure were also excluded fromthe cuts,  remaining programmes would have to be reduced by 3^%.    Ido not believe that this would be a practicable approach.    For someprogrammes it would fall far short of what is feasible, while for others it would require bigger savings than can be secured in 1977-78.
SECRETV      CONCLUSIONS59.   It remains my view that the composition of any package which waannounce must be made up out of the items which I list for decision in the Annex to this paper though, as I have already indicated,my assessment of the potential amounts In particular cases has been revised in the light of my consultations with the Ministers concerned.Before we come to decide on these programmes I should like to draw attention again to two general Issues which are relevant to our decisions:-(a) Whether we rule out any significant amendment to ourstatutory commitment on social security payments,which constitute the largest single expenditure block;(b) whether we confine ourselves to attempting to secureobservance of the existing White Paper figures for local authority current expenditure in 1977-7A, ratherthan seek to bring about some further reduction.    Therela also a question whether the same approach should hold good in this respect for Scotland as for Englandand Wales;   and a further question whether, notwithstandingthis general approach, we should allow an increase in that part of local authority current expenditure which goes onfare subsidies,60.   We have to decide not only on possible programme reductionsbut also on the main additional bids;   otherwise we will not knowwhether total public expenditure is really being reduced or by how much. There are a number of relatively small additional bidswhich we may not be able to settle in detail now, but If so It wouldbe desirable slightly to overshoot our target In order to accommodate the most pressing cases later,    For the rest, I have given an indication in the attached Annex of possible gross reductions inSurvey programmes (before taking- account of the additional bids);the main additional bids which are still outstanding after our
S E C R E Tbilateral discusa-ions; and my proposals for the net reductions on each main programme from which we should make a choice.   The totalof these proposals for net reductions adds up to rather over 1 billion in order to leave some room for choice assuming that cabinet decides that that should be the target figure.
