DOCUMENT JS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAj STY*5 government cp(76) 6630 July 1976CABINETEDUCATIONAL MAINTENANCE ALLOWANCESMemorandum by the Secretaries of State for education and Science and for wales.        Following two previous discussions on educational maintenanceallowances, the Social Services Committee has again considered modifiedproposals for the introduction in England and Wales of a scheme broadlyresembling the existing Scottish scheme.   While we secured strong supportfov the scheme, the Committee was unable to reach an agreed view.    we now seek agreement that these proposals should be implemented and that anannouncement to this effect should be included in the forthcoming statement by the Secretary of State for Employment of measures to combat juvenile unemployment,THE CASE FOR A NEW SCHEME2.        The present system in England and Wales under which the level of grants varies widely between areas at the discretion of local educationauthorities has been much criticised by Parliament, our own Party, theTrades Union Congress (TUC) (processes Annex) and the general public.3.        Energetic steps have been taken through the agency of the ManpowerServices Commission (MSC) to alleviate juvenile unemployment through jobcreation and improved training opportunities, but nothing b&amp;g yet been, donsto help those whose interests would be best served by staying at school or infull-time further education after 16.THE PROPOSED scheme.        We propose that all allowances to boys and girsl over 16 but under 19in full-time education should be paid on a mandatory national means-testedbasis.    The details would in certain respects differ from those of theScottish scheme but allowances and income scales would be on a basis ofparity; for illustrative purposes the calculations in this paper have assumedan average allowance of  185 per annum and a maximum of about  300 perannum.    Local education authorities would, however, have discretion whetheror not to pay an allowance in respect of any particular atudent.    eligibility for an allowance would depend on the student&apos;8 admission to or continuationon a suitable and available educational course.   This reservation is necessary because we recognise that the educational courses will be limited to what canbe provided from available resources of staff and buildings.copy NO  g I
FINANCE5.        We estimate that additional expenditure would be about  14 million in a full year if 21, 000 extra students stayed in education; for 44, 000students it would be  21 million.    The Treasury consider that these figuresunderestimate the additional cost in the third and subsequent years ofproviding education for an extra 44, 000 students.    Students receivingallowances - being in full-time education - would not be registered asunemployed and would no^be eligible to receive supplementary benefit;offsetting savings on this score might amount to  6 million in 1977-78.The expenditure would be an addition to our departmental programmes andwould therefore be a claim on the contingency reserve.6.        It would be unrealistic to expect local education authorities to pay suchallowances without specific government grant, which we propose should be atthe rate of 90 per cent as for mandatory higher education awards.    TheChief Secretary is opposed to the specific grant feature of the scheme on theground that it is not necessary for its effective operation and Is inconsistent with the general policy underlying the Rate Support Grant system.    more generally, the Chief Secretary considers that the introduction of this new scheme would be totally- at variance both with the Government&apos;s recentdecisions on public expenditure and with their specific request to localauthorities to reduce their budgets this year and next.    He thinks it would represent a permanent commitment and not one that could be terminated whenjuvenile unemployment returned to more normal levels.IX GELATION7.        New legislation would be required to empower the Government to lay down the scales of allowances and to pay 90 per cent grant to local educationauthorities.    A new clause for this purpose could be introduced at committee stage into the Education Bill which has just received its Second Reading in theHouse of Lords,    Since such an amendment would be outside the existingMoney Resolution its enactment by the Lords would technically constitute a breach of Commons privilege, but we might reasonably hope that the Houseof Commons would waive this by passing a further Money Resolution.    If weproceed in this way the scheme could be in operation by Easter 1977.conclusion,        We seek the agreement of our colleagues that:-i.    the announcement of measures against juvenile unemployment to be made by the Secretary of State for employment should include a statement, in terms to beagreed with the Department of Education and Science, the welsh Office, and the Treasury, of the governments intention to introduce a new scheme of educationalmaintenance allowances;2
ii,    consultations should be started immediately afterthe statement by the Education Departments with thelocal authority associations, and other interested bodies,about the details of the scheme;iii.    an appropriate Government amendment to the presentEducation Bill should be introduced during the course ofits passage through the House of Lords,FWMJMDepartment of Education and Science30 July 19763
TRADES UNION CONGRESSiI, GENERAL SECRETARf, LIONEL MURRAY OBECONGRESS HOUSE - GREAT RUSSELL STREET * LONDON WCIB 3LSTtltphw 01-6364030 TtUgramt TRAOUN1C LONDON WCIoept Educationour ref    m/$&amp;j/mVOUk REFJuly 26, 1976The Kt.Hon. F.Mulley, M.P.,Secretary of State for Education and Science,Department of Education and Science AElizabeth House,York Road,IOKDOK, S.E.1.Dear Mr,Mulley,Educational Wainteance AllowancesSince the recent meeting between yourself and representativesof the TUC General Council, we have given further considerationto the Education Service &apos;s role in reducing the ^ccePtab1?,high level of unemployment among school leavers and young peoplegenerally.-In recent years the rising trend ofyouth unemployment,combined with tne significant growth in the numbers of schoolleavers that will take place up to 1980,, in our view demandsmedium and long term action to reinforce the short term measures that the Government has now taken.It was for these reasons that the TUC&apos;s 1976 Economicfieview pressed the Government to encourage more young people to stay on at school beyond sixteen, to follow existing andnew courses that are currently being developed in sixth forms,and by improving the existing discretionary scheme of local,authority educational maintenance allowances.j
&apos; Since we met you proposals that have apparently beenthe subject of consideration by a Department of Employment1sManpower Study Group for a mandatory, means-tested schemeof educational maintenance allowances, hatftcome to ournotice.     The conclusion that the scheme could encourageas many as 20,000 extra young people to remain at schoolin the first year of the scheme;with cost implicationsthat are not out of line&apos; with ether MSC measures to controlyouth unemployment, would seem to make this proposal (giventhe positive contribution it can make to the well-being ofthe young people concerned) a particularlystrong candidate for the additional measures that are now under consideration.The TUC consider it a matter of urgency that this issue is discussed with, you immediately.You/s sincerely,General Secretary
