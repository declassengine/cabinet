THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S government cp(76) 55 COPY NO    8116 July 1976CABINETPUBLIC expenditure memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services, I thought it would speed discussion of health and social security,if I made firm proposals for finding the greater part of the sum theChief Secretary is asking of me,SOCIAL SECURITY2,        On the social security aide the Chief Secretary and I are agreedthat we should press on to introduce legislation under which occupational pensions of above  25.00 in the age group 60-65 will have the effect of reducing or eliminating entitlement to unemployment benefit.    This would save about  20 million in a full year and  10 million in 1977-78.   I havealso agreed to a postponement in the introduction of non-contributoryinvalidity benefit to housewives until the autumn 1977.    This would save 13 million in 1977-78.    Together these measures would save  23 million.Beyond these measures we have already agreed there is no scope forfurther social security savings.HEALTH AND PERSONAL SOCIAL services .        I have carried out the most searching examination of the health service budget to see what can be saved without cutting services topatients.   There is very little room for manoeuvre.   The Chief Secretaryasked for cuts of  30 million on the health services capital and another 30 million on National Health Service (NHS) revenue.   Capital is already very much reduced as a result of the last White Paper on public expenditure,   A minimum of health service capital is necessary to makeit possible to concentrate hospital services and thus make the savings inrunning costs required by the last series of cuts.   I am prepared to find 20 million on capital -  10 million from the NHS and  10 million from local authority personal social services - but to go beyond mis would bevery damaging indeed.   As for running costs, I am cutting administrative costs and pruning central support services to the limit to find the1
 30 million needed to pay staff on the Jubilee holiday and to meet the extra cost of junior doctors&apos; overtime.   To cut further would be verydamaging indeed to the NHS where we already face serious problems throughshortage of revenue expenditure.4.       Any additional savings would need to be raised by charges.   Wewould all agree that to try and raise prescription charges would so enrageour supporters and the Trades Union Congress that we might not be able toget the legislation through the House.    Increases in dental and ophthalmiccharges will be opposed but less strenuously.   I think therefore that wemust raise them to the limit.    Thus I am suggesting a very substantial increase to raise  20 million.5.        TiwChtof 6aero*a*y*** l-Bgw than ia pwimmiftm we should makemotorists pay for the full cost falling on the Health Service from accidentson the roads.    This would save  40- 45 million in a full year.    Theproblem is to realise the whole of this saving for the critical year of1977-78.    I am convinced that if we take the decision now and hasten into consultation with the insurance companies and others, it should be possibleto Btart getting in the money soon after April 1977: in the annex to this paper I explain the operational steps which are required.    But I am prepared to include only half a full year&apos;e savings (ie  20 million) in mypackage.6.        That makes  60 million on health and personal social services - ormore if we can get more than a half year&apos;s savings from road accidentcharges,   I hope that this - together with my offer of  23 million on social security - will be accepted as a fair share of the package.   If not,and more is needed I suggest that we should adopt Hie same solution as inthe post devaluation cuts announced in January 1968 - namely a small increase in the contribution for the NHS paid by employers with the national insurance contribution.    This would make it unnecessary to impose furthercuts in the service.    We should make it clear that that was why we were doing it.    Our creditors would know that the reduction In the Public SectorBorrowing Requirement was guaranteed and not just promised.   An increaseof 0.1 per cent would raise about  60 million.    It can hardly be argued thatthis would reduce taxable capacity.   The effect on the Retail Price fadexwould be a tiny 0.05 per cent.   This would of course require legislation,but provided that at least four months&apos; notice was given, the increase could operate from April 1977.7.        The measures I am suggesting total more than the  100 million I ambeing asked for on the health programme.D EDepartment of Health and Social Security16 July 1976

If      ^o.ll(?:-:&apos;7Lia:; purree, a change can be made in the arranceicentsfor obr-.itd^     Lor u;;ers a contribution to the costs of the JOScaused by road accidents, so as to increase the yield from this sourcefrom about i^lfn a .vt:?.r at present to about  /jO- 45ra a year.2.

It is wasteful in adninistration and limited in scope and the na^iciura cla,ins and fees were last adjusted in 1969.   (Themaximum 0-  200 per c-ir.e nowhere near reflects our estimate of the fullaverage cotit which io nearly  5^0).3.   I want to introduce a direct levy on motor insurers.   The levy, paid into the IJHS centrally, would be based on the coat (including a capitalelement) of maintaining HHS treatment services to handle the patientsinjured in road traffic accidents.   Each insurer&apos;s share would be related to their total gross annual income from motor vehicle insurance.   Hieincreased premium that insurers would have to charge to offset the levywould amount to about  5 a vehicle (flat rate).   The total effect on theRPI, including the indirect effect of increased premiums for commercial vehicles (an allowable cost under the price code), is estimated to be. less than 0.1 per cent.4.   The levy would cover HHS costs, and vehicle users, in England, wales and Scotland and would periodically be reviewed in the light of statistics of usage and costs.Timing5.   The following steps will be required:July - announcement of proposal in principle;

The statutory provision for the levy would need several clauses,including repeal of the existing unsatisfactory arrangements.   1hope ray colleagues will agree that the Drink and Driving Bill, itself of high priority to reduce road accidents, will be in the 1976-77Session and that these Clauses should be incorporated in it.
