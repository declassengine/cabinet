JT*05 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government cp(76) 60 COPY NO     8127 July 1976CABINETUNEMPLOYMENT AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE:THE JOB SWAP scheme memorandum by the Secretary of State for employment, 1 have proposed for early announcement four additional measures against unemployment.    The Cabinet agreed on 15 July to two of them - the amended subsidy scheme for the longer term young unemployed (affecting27, 000 young people) and 3, 000 additional training places - and CP(76) 58expresses the agreement of my colleagues in the Ministerial Group onUnemployment among Young People to the introduction of a work experiencescheme for about 30, 000 young people.   The gross cost of these threemeasures is  24^ million and the net cost  14  million.2.        This package will make &amp; useful impact on youth unemployment this autumn and winter, but I do not regard it as adequate to the requirement onunemployment generally.   Another 37,000 people were added to theseasonally adjusted total of unemployed (excluding school leavers) thismonth and early intimations suggest that the August figures will show afurther rise.   So the two months be/ore the Trades Union Congress (TUC)will show unemployment rising more sharply than recently from a rate which is already one of the highest in tne European Economic Community.And although we expect unemployment to stop rising later tills year, weface the prospect of around if million unemployed right through the winter.3.       If we are to carry the TUC with us, we must show a greater concern to bring down unemployment in the next year than the three measuresspecifically directed to the young unemployed on their own.   The unions are quite alarmed about the very high level of unemployment among theiradult members as among school leavers and, although our currentunemployment measures should reduce the number unemployed over theperiod of their operation by a total of about 250, 000 below what it would otherwise have been, this is not going to seem enough when the actual figures are now 200, 000 above the unemployment level when they were introducedlast autumn.   The social contract as we have just agreed it with the unions,requires the Government to be ready to take further selective measures as necessary to reduce unemployment in the next year.1
4.      The job swap scheme would be a substantial and imaginative additionto our battery of measures against unemployment.   It has the problems towhich CP(76) 58 rightly draws attention, but these are no greater than inother measures that we have adopted or have considered adopting.   Itsgreat advantage is that it would produce genuine jobs in situations wherethe older men are glad to vacate them and substantially reduce theunemployment register in the process (by over 90,000 at the peak of its operation in the first half of next year).    Its announcement now would help us with the TUC - it would offset their concern about the future job lossesassociated with the public expenditure cuts and increased national insurance contributions - and it could help us particularly through thewinter by accelerating the trend to lower unemployment next year and bycushioning the termination of the temporary employment subsidy at the endof this year,5.        The scheme has a gross cost of  118 million and a net cost of 42 million and its addition to the other three measures would raise the gross cost of the total package to  142^ million and the net cost to 56  million.6.        The Ministerial Croup agreed to exclude from the scheme thoseelderly workers already registered as unemployed on the ground that theywould not be releasing any jobs and paying the allowance to them would merely be cosmetic in effect.    This would reduce the numbers likely totake up the scheme from 116, 000 to 87, 000 and reduce the gross cost by 25 million and the net cost by  11 million (unless we were to use the moneyto increase the allowance and the take up from among those in jobs),7,        I think my colleagues should be aware, however, that there aredifficulties in excluding the unemployed elderly.    They could claim thatthe operation of this scheme will make it even more difficult for them toget a job.    Employers will not be interested in taking on someone who might then apply for release under the scheme (even though his release is within their control) and the elderly unemployed may well feel that the employmentservices are unlikely to put any effort into their placement when theGovernment are actively encouraging people of their age to leaveemployment,   hi these circumstances it may be regarded as unfair to barthem from access to a scheme which would remove them from the labour market.    They could also maintain that, while releasing unemployedelderly workers from the register is not the same as releasing jobs,their removal from the labour market eases the competitive position ofother unemployed.   I think there is enough in this argument from equityto warrant our keeping an open mind until we have consulted the TUC onthe principle of the scheme,8,        I therefore invite my colleagues to agree that I should announce, inaddition to the other measures against youth unemployment, that theGovernment are considering a job swap scheme along these lines, thedetails of which remain to be worked out in consultation with others2
concerned, but which it is intended to introduce In the autumn at a likely-cost of  118 million and which would be expected to cover about 140, 000people, most of whom would be in jobs which would thus be released forunemployed people.    I think it would be wise to consult the TUC on theprinciple of the scheme before making the announcement and to let the confederation of British Industry know what is in mind; subsequently,1 would consult them both about the practical arrangements for operatingthe scheme so as to achieve its purpose.A BDepartment of Employment27 July 19763
