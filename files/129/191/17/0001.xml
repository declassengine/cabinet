THE WORLD FOOD CRISIS AND THIRD WORLD DEVELOPMENT:IMPLICATIONS FOR UNITED KINGDOM POLICYObservations by the Minister for Overseas development . The Minister for Overseas Development welcomes the Select Committee&apos;sendorsement, in its Report &quot;The World Food Crisis and Third World Develop-ment: Implications for UK Policy&quot;, of the new aid strategy set out in the white paper &quot;The Changing Emphasis in British Aid Policies. More Help for the poorest&quot; (Cmnd 6270). The Minister would, however, like to express his concernat the Committee^ general verdict, much emphasised in press reports, that theMinistry*s approach to implementing this policy is &quot;faltering&quot; and makes too much of the difficulties. We have already given considerable thought to devisingthe best means for implementing this shift in emphasis in our aid programme,but the speed with which we can do so will depend on a number of constraints,many of them outside our control, and must be consistent with the wise use ofscarce concessional resources. Other donors pursuing similar policies haveencountered similar constraints; and in the replies to the Committee^ specific recommendations we have thought it right to be frank about the difficulties aswe see them. Though we believe that we shall achieve our objective of ensuring that more of our aid reaches the poorest people in the poorest countries, wemust identify at the outset the very real practical problems which we are likelyto encounter: in our view this is to be realistic, not cautious. Against this background, the Minister has the following observations on the recommendations in the Committee&apos;! Report.3
(1) The Ministry of Overseas Development should have joint and equalresponsibility with the Ministry of Agriculture in all the negotiations on world food security stocks. (Paragraph 32)2. Food security is based upon the production of, and trade in, cereals and,as far as the European Economic Community is concerned, on its supportpolicy under the Common Agricultural Policy. These are central to agricultural policy and as the Minister for Overseas Development said in evidence to theCommittee at its hearing on 19 November 1975, the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food has primary responsibility for world food security mattersinsofar as these relate to agricultural support policy and international dis-cussions on trade in agricultural commodities. This does not mean, however,that that Ministry formulates the United Kingdom position on its own. Thefullest possible consultation is carried out with the Ministry of Overseas Develop-ment and other interested Departments on matters of joint concern, prior todiscussions in the international organisations concerned, in order that theMAFF spokesmen may represent the views of the United Kingdom government as a whole. We therefore see no advantages in altering the present position.(2) The British Government should use its influence to bring world foodsecurity stocks negotiations to a speedy conclusion and should aim forsignificant solutions. (Paragraph 35)3. The Minister agrees that the United Kingdom Government, in concert with the rest of the European Community, should use its influence to this end.We are working actively with our Community partners to promote a successful outcome to the current discussions on world food security stocks. These aretaking place in the GATT Multilateral Trade Negotiations, which are the mainforum for international trade negotiations, and in the International wheat council, which is the body which would be responsible for administering anagreement and which has the necessary technical expertise. These discussions are related and do not duplicate one another. The matters are of a complextechnical nature and there are many practical difficulties which must be resolvedin order to achieve a satisfactory solution. We shall also play a full part in discussions in the World Food Council, which has a general responsibility for reviewing progress towards better world food security.(3) The United Kingdom should oppose proposals that the European Com-munity should produce planned food surpluses for food aid except as partof an e.c. contribution to agreed world food security stocks. (Paragraph 38)4. Decisions affecting Community food production policies have to be takenwithin the common agricultural policy. The Minister agrees that, in consideringthe level of Community food production and the use of Community production for food aid, it is essential to try to ensure the efficient use of resources. TheGovernment have made dear the importance they attach to discouragingwasteful agricultural surpluses within the Community We will continue to pursue this policy. At the same time, we will certainly take account of thedevelopment of international policies for ensuring world food security.
(4) The British Government should spell out clearly to the recipient govera-ments the purposes for which UK aid is made available. (Paragraph 50)5. The Ministry of Overseas Development is making clear to recipientgovernments our wish to concentrate on poverty-focused projects, particularly those aimed at the rural poor. We shall continue to do this and are taking a positive tine m seeking out projects which accord with the new aid strategy(see paragraph 7 below). The Department has been instructed to be moreenergetic in this than in the past. However, we believe that the Committee mayhave underestimated the problems of succeeding with the new strategy withoutthe full co-operation of the sovereign governments concerned. A project whichdoes not have the support of the recipient government will not be successful.6. This apart, poverty-focused and rural projects often take time to prepare and disbursements are likely to start only slowly. Despite the increasingemphasis we are putting on these projects we shall wish to continue to financeother developmentally sound projects of priority to recipient governments.Many of these projects will indirectly benefit the poor, for example, by creatingemployment opportunities. But we expect the implementation of the policy togather momentum first in agreement with recipient governments and then indisbursements.(5) The British Government should play a more positive role in the identificationand selection of individual projects. (Paragraph 51)7. The Minister recognises that if we are to fulfil our objectives of cokxb-trating on poverty-focused projects we shall need in future to be more activethan hitherto in identifying them. The headquarters staff of ODM and the over-seas posts and Development Divisions are taking positive action in this regard inconsultation with recipient governments. We plan to make more use of projectidentification teams, made up of experts on different sectors, drawn fromODM&apos;s administrative and advisory staff or from our posts overseas orDevelopment Divisions, and complemented where necessary from other sources of expertise such as consultants. We are encouraging consultants to come to us with ideas for projects suitable for aid finance, and are developing closercontacts with international agencies such as the World Bank and FAO.(6) The Ministry of Overseas Development should recognise that the primaryobjective of the aid programme is to help poor people, (Paragraph 54)8. This is the main objective of the Governments aid policy, as set out inthe White Paper &quot;More Help for the Poorest&quot; (Cmnd 6270). We recognisethat there are very poor people in the richer as well as in the poor developing countries. Where we continue to give aid to the richer developing countrieswe shall try to concentrate on the poorer sections of their communities.However, we believe that our main concern should be with those countrieswhich are least able to finance their own development Our aim will, therefore,be to concentrate our aid on the poorest sections of the community is the poorest countries.
(7) The Ministry of Overseas Development should show more willingness tomeet requests for the payment of local and recurrent costs. (Paragraph 61)9. Recent evidence suggests that with one or two major exceptions ODM&apos;present procedures have not seriously hindered the selection or implementation of capital projects. Problems have, however, arisen on technical co-operationprojects over local and recurrent costs. We recognise that these problems may become more severe as we place more emphasis on poverty-focused projects.We shall need to look at these problems case by case.(8a) The Ministry of Overseas Development should:(a) Set out new criteria and procedures for the identification, selection,implementation and monitoring of new programmes and projects forreaching the poorest.10. These matters will be kept under review by the Steering Group on rural development now set up in ODM, which has already drawn up guidelines forthe selection of projects, emphasising the question &quot;who benefits?&quot;. Furtherguidance on how best to implement the new policy will be issued as necessary.Particular attention is being paid to ensuring that in selecting projects full account is taken not only of the economic benefits but also of the social benefitsinvolved in, for example, rural health or family planning projects. We realise that these measures are only a start As the implementation of our policyprogresses we shall learn more about the procedures and criteria necessary atall stages of project selection and implementation.(8b) The Ministry of Overseas Development should:(&amp;) Estimate the additional manpower this will require and its allocationbetween UK and overseas posts.11. It is clear that the new policy will put a strain on available manpower in ODM and in some overseas posts. This is likely to increase as we become involved in more property-focused projects, which are staff intensive at every stage. We have already made some additions to the staff to take account ofthe new policy, for example, an additional agricultural economist in ODMitself; a social development adviser for the Middle East Development Division;an agricultural economist for the East Africa Development Division; an agricultural economist and two social development advisers for the CaribbeanDevelopment Division; and the attachment of agricultural specialists to the posts in Dacca and Jakarta.12. The additional manpower requirements will be kept under review but other action to limit the size of the Civil Service and the Diplomatic Service islikely to prove a serious constraint We are considering the extent to whichstaffing problems can be met by making more use of outside experts (seeparagraph 13 below).
(8c) The Ministry of Overseas Development should:(e) Estimate the extent to which it will need to make greater use of experts outside its own employment and whether such manpowerwill in fact be available.13, There is a great deal of expertise on rural development within ODMand its Scientific Units (for example, the Land Resources Division, the TropicalProducts Institute and the Centre for Overseas Pest Research). It may bepossible to augment it by appointments under the Home Based Scheme, butwe shall certainly need to make more use of outside experts (eg, consultants,experts from United Kingdom universities, and technical co-operation experts in between overseas assignments), especially for project identification missions.Manpower constraints can also be lessened by closer co-operation with otherdonors and, for example, closer links are being developed with the FAO andthe World Bank. On the other hand, increasing demand for scarce expertisein the rural development field, not just by ODM but by international organisa-tions, is likely to make it difficult always to find the right people, but measuresto overcome this are being considered (see paragraph 25 below).(8d) The Ministry of Overseas Development should:(d) Estimate the shift within its own staff in areas of expert knowledge that will be needed, appraise retraining and other implications and make proposals for effecting the necessary action.14. Some intensified expertise may be needed in areas directly related to capital aid for rural development, particularly to its social aspects. As mentionedin paragraph 11 above, some changes in this direction have already been made.This will be kept under review.15. One implication of increasing ODM&apos;s staff is that it means tapping thesame limited pool of expertise as is needed to serve overseas in implementingprojects we finance. This conflict may well be lessened by the various methodswe are now considering of increasing the pool of expertise in the ways set outin paragraph 25 below, for example, by instituting appropriate training andretraining arrangements.(fie) The Ministry of Overseas Development should:(e) set out a target for the proportion of aid that can be used for rural development over the next five years. (Paragraph 67)16. The constraints on aid to rural development are not so much financialas managerial. For example, projects are often complex and take time toprepare and implement Many involve relatively small amounts of money. Theamount we can spend on rural development will vary from country to country,depending in part on how far we can succeed in securing the co-operationof the recipient government We think ft better to concentrate on measures toincrease the aid we can give to rural development in each country, rather than to set an overall target. A recent analysis shows that more of our total aid programme is going to the rural poor than the 10 per cent figure mentioned inparagraph 66 of the Select Comiaittee*s report. The analysis was not of our whole aid programme and so we do not have a definite figure. But it is now clear that in 1974 about half of our bilateral project aid (which is about 30 percent of our total aid programme) went on projects to help the rural poor.
(9) The Ministry of Overseas Development should create or adapt coursesmore appropriate to the needs of students from developing countries ateducational institutions in the UK and should be prepared to finance theacquisition of overseas experience by staff involved in such courses.(Paragraph 85)17. This recommendation is accepted. Many standard courses attended byODM-financed students meet their requirements satisfactorily or can be adapted to do so. We already make special payments for such courses but itis not practicable to create special courses unless there is adequate demand from developing countries, nor is it desirable, as the Committee have noted,to encourage the formation of small &quot;cells&quot; of overseas students within Britisheducation institutions.18. Our policy is to strengthen, with appropriate technical co-operation,training facilities at every level in the developing countries themselves, and to concentrate UK training in those subject areas in which it will remain necessaryfor some time.19. We already finance visits overseas by UK course staff to enable themto acquire experience.(10) The Ministry of Overseas Development should be prepared to financepost-graduate research in developing countries as well as in the UK.(Paragraph 86)20. The Minister accepts this recommendation in principle. We will continueto try to increase the proportion of research training carried out in developing countries and are willing to promote schemes for &quot;split ttaining&apos;&apos;. We are readyto examine any financial obstacles to the pursuit of this policy.(11) The Ministry of Overseas Development should give greater publicity and encouragement to on the job training courses with British firms. (Para-graph 87)21. ODM had this in hand when the Committee was appointed. There hasbeen an increase of almost 50 per cent in the number of such trainees (296 in1974/75,429 in 1975/76) since the Committee received its evidence (on 21 May1975); and the trend continues.(12) In future far less rigid criteria should be applied to third country trainingprogrammes with a view to switching a significant proportion oirrafnmgfunds to this purpose. (Paragraph 91)22. We have already reviewed policy on third country training and initiallyare promoting it at least to the level of our present authority. As a first stepwe are compiling a list of acceptable institutions in third countries. We shallincrease third country bilateral training in appropriate cases. We are alreadyfinancing third country training through multilateral agencies.
(13) The Ministry of Overseas Development should make full use of the opportunities provided by the technical assistance and consultancy itfinances to send young professionals, such as agriculturalists, economists,engineers, rural sociologists and teachers, abroad to work alongside moreexperienced UK personnel. (Paragraph 97)23, The Minister agrees with this recommendation. ODM already operatesor helps to finance a number of schemes which provide young professionals with first-hand knowledge of overseas conditions these include the natural resources Studentship Scheme (which has recently been increased to providefor 40 studentships), the Overseas Development Institute Nuffield ScholarshipsScheme (ODINS) for young economists (15 a year), and some ODM-sponsoredresearch projects. We have started to include younger people in teams whichconsultants send out under our auspices. Many people, including teachers, gainuseful overseas experience when serving as volunteers. We are joining the FAOAssociate Expert Scheme. There is clearly, however, a need for us to extendour assistance in this area so that a pool of younger experienced professionalscan be maintained.(14) The Ministry of Overseas Development should provide without delay aprojected manpower requirement, identifying the needs in the technical assistance programme and proposing means of meeting such needs.(Paragraph 99)24. The Ministry&apos;! Manpower Planning Unit has a particular responsibility to monitor manpower needs of developing countries and the United Kingdom&apos;capacity to supply those needs. While, however, we win continue closely tomonitor future manpower requirements, and do all we can to limit the manpowerconstraint on the technical co-operation programme, it is unlikely that a firmprojection of manpower requirements could be produced at this stage, or thatit would be useful for long. The precise requirements win be dependent on thedevelopment of country programmes.25. Some countries are at present highly dependent on United Kingdompersonnel in, for instance, secondary education and the number of UnitedKingdom teachers will not therefore decline suddenly. It is policy, however, to concentrate on teacher trainers rather than on the supply of teachers. the manpower Planning Unit, in collaboration with Geographical Departments,undertakes regular country manpower reviews looking three years ahead. Theswitch in emphasis will develop from these at the same time as we maintainpressure for localisation and reduced requirements for United Kingdompersonnel in areas of relatively low priority. We have already taken some stepsto expand the future supply of expertise in some fields for new programmes and projects for the poorest people in developing countries. Examples of the steps taken or under consideration to meet future needs are:(!) Expansion of the Corps of Specialists for Renewable natural resources staff.(ii) Expansion of the Home Based Scheme for various disciplines, includ-ing the establishment of additional posts at ODM&apos;s Scientific Units.Oii) Provision of mid-career refresher training for technical co-operationofficers and supplemented staff.
(iv) Use of FAO Associate Expert Scheme.(v) Expansion of the Natural Resources Studentship Scheme.(vi) Other measures to provide pre-service training and overseas experi-enoe for young professionals in required disciplines (see paragraph 23above).(vii) Giving greater priority in the Educational Development Awardsprogramme to areas of education of increasing priority.(viii) Increased attempts to attract returning technical co-operationofficers, supplemented staff and volunteers in scarce disciplines tofarther service overseas.(ix) Improvement of information retrieval of available expertise for technical co-operation assignments.(15) The Ministry should systematically link scientific and socio-economicresearch based on their field and project experience. (Paragraph 107)26. The Minister agrees that a more systematic link between science andsocio-economics will be required both in the planning of research and in itsimplementation, and will seek to strengthen it.(16) The Ministry should encourage the CGIAR research institutes to takemore positive steps to assist small farmers. (Paragraph 10S)27. The Minister is keen that the work of the International AgriculturalInstitutes under CGIAR auspices should assist small farmers and we shall continue to encourage work to this end. Indeed, the latest programmes of boththe older and the newly-established Institutes are aimed at the problems of the rural poor. Many of the crops and farming systems under examination are thoseof small farmers, for example, millet, sorghum, rice, various legumes andanimal production: an important function of the Institutes is to collaborate withdeveloped and developing country research programmes and services in testingvarieties and systems and adapting them to specific needs.(17) The Ministry should appoint a Research Publications Officer to co-ordinateand publicise research results at more popular levels than those of the scientific literature. (Paragraph 110)28. The Minister recognises that there is a need for further action in thissphere and is considering how this can be provided. As explained in evidence to the Committee we believe that the major popularisation of results for use in developing countries, particularly by small farmers, must come throughnational extension services.(18) The British Government should seek to improve the machinery forco-operation, consultation and exchange of information at all stagesbetween aid donors. (Paragraph 113)29. We already attach great importance to encouraging co-operation betweenaid donors, both in respect of individual recipient countries and generally, on matters of aid policy and administration, and we have always taken a leading
role in trying to improve the existing machinery. An increasing number of developing countries are covered by consultative groups or consortia in whichdonors and recipients meet regularly, usually under the chairmanship of theWorld Bank, to discuss aid needs. There are also frequent informal contacts between ODM officials and their opposite numbers in other donor countries and institutions and regular informal meetings between donor representatives in many recipient countries. The degree to which we and other donors canfoster such co-operation does, however, depend on the views of the recipientgovernment; some are more enthusiastic about it than others. Some donorgovernments also show reluctance to participate in such activities.30. We participate fully with other donors in discussing aid policies and practices in the Development Assistance Committee of OECD and in the eec, where efforts are now being made to improve the harmonisation andco-ordination of bilateral aid programmes.(19) The Ministry of Overseas Development should take part in joint develop-ment projects designed to relieve poverty even where the contribution,intrinsically valuable, lacks international recognition. (Paragraph 114)31. The Minister accepts this recommendation. It is not a precondition ofour participation in joint projects that there should be recognition of our contribution outside the recipient country.(20) ODM should immediately institute a series of meetings with the voluntaryagencies to review the working of the joint funding scheme and to speedup its implementation. (Paragraph 117)32. Progress with this scheme has improved since the Select Committee was informed of the initial progress and to date almost  350,000 has been committed to sixteen projects; contributions amounting to over  300,000 for twenty-threefurther projects arc under consideration. But there is room for further improve-ment and The Minister shares the Committees concern that the scheme shouldnot become bogged down with procedural difficulties. We are considering possiblerelaxations of our accounting requirements consistent with the AccountingOfficers responsibility to Parliament and the possibility of reducing the detail ofinformation for which the agencies are asked. We are constantly in touch withthe United Kingdom agencies and welcome discussion with them about ways in which the scheme can be developed.33. In addition to the joint financing scheme, special arrangements have beenmade to assist voluntary agencies which are extending maternal and childhealth care and family planning services to the poorer communities of theThird World. To date  157,000 has been spent in this way.(21) The Ministry of Overseas Development should ensure that, throughregular meetings and other means, there is greater interchange of informa-tion and expertise on rural development with British consultant firms andshould make positive proposals for the utilisation of this knowledge.(Paragraph 118)34. To follow up the October 1974 Conference with British consultantsODM held a meeting with the British Consultants Bureau (BCB) in January
this year at which progress on the rural development policy, the role of con-sultan ts and other items of current concern were discussed. In reponse to anODM invitation the consultants expressed a willingness to help identify projects for possible aid financing and we are advising overseas posts that they should give consultants positive support in this. We shall continue to make use ofconsultants&apos; expertise for pre-investment studies and in connection with projectimplementation.35. We plan to hold regular meetings with the BCB so that there can bemore exchange of information and consultants can be kept informed of changes of emphasis or new directions in ODM policies. We have also askedconsultants to keep in touch with country aid programme changes by contactingthe appropriate ODM Geographical Department before visiting a country.(22) In the context of creating rural jobs, a fresh look should be taken at thedecision not to implement the scheme of support for pre-mvestmentstudies authorised by the Overseas Investment and Export Guarantee Act1972. (Paragraph 122)36, The Minister has had a fresh took at the Pre-Investment Studies Schemeand announced on 22 March 1976 the decision to revive the scheme in respect ofdevelopment, particularly of course that which is likely to create rural employ-ment, to which the host governments attach priority.(23) The Ministry of Overseas Development should investigate the possibilityof financing, or helping to finance, an institution designed to improve the capacity of developing countries for gaining access to foreign investment.(Paragraph 123)37. Many developing countries need help and advice on foreign investment and the safeguarding of national interests. The United Nations and the WorldBank Group, both important sources of capital assistance, increasingly offeradvice on investment policy. The Commonwealth Development corporation and the International Finance Corporation, with wide experience of projectappraisal, can bring domestic and foreign interests together in exploring invest-ment opportunities. IFC plans in future to provide poorer countries with additional technical advice; and the new Investment Co-operative ProgrammeOffice of UNIDO has been created with a similar purpose in mind in the field of industrial investment,38. The UN Information and Research Centre on Transnational Corpora-tions is also setting up a technical co-operation programme to assist developing countries in the co-ordination of investment policy, project formulation andappraisal, competitive bidding procedures and the negotiation of agreements with multi-national corporations. It aims to provide technical advisers, training,information services and to stimulate discussion between the governments of developing countries and representatives of multinational corporations.39. The Minister is prepared to supplement such activities, where necessary,within the general framework of our policy of concentrating aid on the poorest countries and particularly projects likely to benefit people, in rural areas. We are,however, inclined to think that an increase in assistance of this nature is probablybest achieved through existing mstrtutions.Mntad la BajUnd ft* Bet Mabrntfi StatloMj OOm by Huritoa tt Soot (Bum^Ltd.1SST9 Dd 93834 KM 7/76ISBN 0 10 165670 X
