the organisation of race relationsadministrationobservations on the report of the selectcommittee on race relations andimmigrationINTHODUCnON1. The Government welcomed the decision of the Select Committee to devotethe 1974/75 session to an enquiry into the organisation of race relations adminis-tration; and was particularly grateful to the Committee for carrying out itsenquiry quickly and making its Report in time for the relevant recommendations to be taken into account in the proposals for new legislation in the White paper on Racial Discrimination (Cmnd. 6234).2, The Government decided that it was essential to publish the proposals for legislation in time for a Bill to be introduced in the present session so that new provisions against discrimination may take effect as soon as possible. As theCommittee had assumed, the Bill strengthens the present law against racial discrimination and harmonises the powers of enforcement with those provided in the Sex Discrimination Act 1975.3. The Select Committee^ Report deals with many matters of administration which are not included in the Bill or appropriate to legislation. This White Papersets out the Governments views on all the recommendations made in the Report.CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ARRANGEMENTS4. The Select Committee rightly stressed the responsibility which centralGovernment departments have for policies relating to race relations. Depart-ments take account of race relations and the needs of the racial minorities aspart of their overall responsibilities in education, in housing, in employment or in personal social services; but it is not necessarily appropriate for all departments to set up separate specialist race relations sections. The Depart-ment of Employment has a special unit concerned with race relations and afield service of race relations employment advisers. The arrangements withinthe Department of Education and Science are described in (4) of the Annex.The Departments of the Environment and of Health and Social Security,however, while taking into account the fact that their policies have to meetthe needs of the racial minorities as well as other groups in society, do notbelieve that their responsibilities would be better fulfilled by creating specialistrace relations sections. Their reasons are set out in (4) and (6) of the Annex.MONITORING BY CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS. The Select Committee stressed the importance of monitoring the race relations situation. The Government accepts that the Home Office should retaincentral responsibility for race relations policy; and as the department with this responsibility it must be in a position to form an overall view of the race relationssituation and to ensure that the departments with specific responsibilities aredeveloping their own policies on a co-ordinated basis. As detailed in the Annex,the staff concerned with race relations policies in the Home Office have been
strengthened; and with the Home Office as the focal point, other Governmentdepartments can contribute to die assessment of the race relations situation fromtheir own resources, for example in the field of education through the experienceof HM inspectors, to whose role the Select Committee rightly attached import-anoe, through the regionally based race relations employment advisers of theDepartment of Employment and through the Regional Social Work Service ofthe Department of Health and Social Security. Such an assessment also depends on the contribution of the local authorities and other organisations such as theCB1 and the TUC. The new Standing Advisory Council, proposed in the white paper on Racial Discrimination, will be able to advise the Home Secretary on allthe major aspects of race relations policy.MINISTERIAL RESPONSIBILITY8. The Government agrees with the Select Committee&apos;s view that the centralresponsibility of the Home Office for race relations policy should be exercisedthrough the Home Secretary as a senior member of the Cabinet In thesecircumstances it seems inappropriate to appoint a Minister with the formal title of Minister of State for Equal Rights since this would merely duplicate the HomeSecretary^ own responsibilities. The precedents quoted by the Committee forgiving specific responsibilities for certain subjects to named Ministers, do not, inthe Government&apos;s view, provide exact parallels. In accordance with the normalarrangements, the Home Secretary devolves on his Ministers the day-to-dayresponsibOity-fbr the implementation of both race relations and sex discrimination -rwtion policies ^hfte retaining the final responsibility himself.COMMUNITY RELATIONS ORGANISATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL7. The Select Committee emphasised the valuable role which the variouscommunity relations councils play as autonomous bodies outside the officialstructure. The Government made it dear in the White Paper on Racial Dis-criirnnation that it accepted the importance of the work of these councils andtheir officers and that after further consultations with those concerned, it would propose arrangements to enable the work to continue to be supported and developed.8, Then is considerable divergence of views on what the role of the community relations councilftshould be and how they should relate to central Government,the statutory Commission and the local authorities. It is natural that independentbodies, working in different areas with differing characters, should have developedalong various lines; but few would deny the need for central support andcoMMdjnation. At present the Ctonjmunity Relations Commission undertakesthkrole, .y,, ,,.   , t- t  .9. The Runnymede Trust has proposed a radical restructuring of community relations work which would invtflve^cenrral Government directly in providingsp^attrt advice and co-ordination in addition to financial support They have proposed that this task; should be carried out by a &quot;Community RelationsInspectorate&quot; which would administer a community relations service from within the Home Office. This proposal would involve a fundamental change inthe relitiouickip between community relations councils and their local officers.Tin ^ffistft while retaining their independence, would become more responsibletothecraiLralited agency and the councils would assume a role more in the nature
of informed advisory bodies which would provide support for the work of the professional community relations service.10. The Government takes the view that it cannot provide the necessaryexpertise which this proposal envisages and that those concerned with the workof the community relations councils would regard direct Government involve-mert t as an unacceptable loss of independence.11. The work of the community relations councils is by definition local. Muchof it concerns matters which fall within the responsibilities of the local authorities for implementing central Government policies. The local authorities are nearestto the problems of their areas and best able to judge how their resources shouldbe allocated to meet local needs. A case can therefore be argued for placingresponsibility for supporting the community relations councils, both financiallyand professionally, on the local authorities for developing the councils as an advisory service through which the local authorities could establish better contact with the minority communities in their area and thereby increase their under-standing of the needs of these communities and the way in which the services which they provide can best meet these needs. It is arguable that community relations officers would be able to exercise greater influence if they occupied anappropriately senior position within the local government structure than theycan ever achieve in their present detached position.12. The Community Relations Commission and the community relationscouncils and officers, individually and through their representative bodies, have however urged, like the Select Committee itself, that the autonomy of the council&apos;s and community relations officers is of paramount importance if theacceptance of the minority communities is to be won. The Government thereforeaccepts that the present structure of independent community relations councils and officers should be continued and that central Government support should bechannelled through an independent central body.13. The Government considered very carefully whether the community relations Commission^ responsibility for co-ordinating community relationscouncils should be assigned to the new Commission for Racial Equality whichthe Race Relations Bill will establish, or whether an alternative arrangement would be preferable. The new Commission will be a statutory body with responsibilities for enforcing the new law against discrimination and, more widely, for taking action to promote equality of opportunity. Its wide powers for conducting investigations into the policies and practices of public and privateorganisations clearly call for a body with an unimpeachable reputation whoseadvice will be recognised as authoritative and impartial. It has been argued thatsuch a body cannot have responsibilities for local ficldwork without detriment to its law enforcement function. On the other hand the Commission will be concerned with all aspects of the situation of the racial minorities. Unlike the race Relations Board its responsibilities will go much wider than the enforce-ment of anti-discrimination law. The closer its links with the minority com-munities at the local level the better it will be able to form an appreciation of the overall race relations situation and the greater will be its credibility with minoritygroups. As the Home Secretary announced on 11 December 1975 (official report, Vol 902, Cols 294-295) the Government came to the conclusion that,while the arguments are finely balanced, it is preferable for the new Commission
to take over the responsibilities for fieldwork at the local level which at presentfall to the Community Relations, Commission. The Government recognises,however, that a conflict of interests could arise and that a degree of separation inthe organisation of the different functions is therefore necessary. A formalrequirement for this purpose is included in the Race Relations Bill.14. The hew structure which the Government proposes does not give com-munity relations councils and their officers a statutory role. It would not be appropriate for the Government to seek to define in statutory terms theirchanging functions. It will fall to the new Commission, in taking over the co-cmlinating functions of the Comnramty Relations Commission, to help thecommunity relations councils to formulate their objectives and develop their role. Important matters concerning the relationship between the councils andtheir officers and in particular the question of whether community relationsofficers should be employed by the councils or by the new Commission onwhich various proposals have been made by the Select Committee and others,must be decided through consultations between the Commission and the councils and community relations officers and their representative bodies. The Govern-ment will, of course, take a close interest in developments.15. The local authorities already participate in the activities of the community relations councils and the Government welcomes the support which they provide,often on a generous scale. That this relationship should be given statutory authority has its attractions; but, if it is accepted, as indeed it is by the localauthorities themselves as well as by those working in community relations, thatthe essence of the relationship must remain that of the independence of thecommunity relations councils, it would be inappropriate to seek to impose a statutory duty on local authorities requiring them to support the councils. TheGxjvernment is confident that the local authorities can be relied upon toccratione to give the community relations councils the priority they deserve.THE MINORITY COMMUNITIES16. The Select Committee rightly stressed the importance of the part whichthe minority communities themselves must play if a healthy multi-racial societyis to be developed. It would be a great loss to society if the minorities did not come to play an active part m the life of the community as a whole but insteadsought refuge from the difficulties which they face by concerning themselvesexclusively with their own affairs. As the Select Committee emphasised theGovernment can encourage the participation of the minority communities; andit is highly desirable that both the Government and the new Commission should encourage the growth of minority group organisations which can help the communities to meet their own needs. In considering appointments to such bodies as the Standing&quot; Advisory Council and the Commission for RacialEquality the Government is conscious of the need to select individuals of highcalibre who can speak for the minorities with experience and insight.THE COMMISSION FOR RACIAL EQUALITY17. The Race Relations Bill gives effect to the Governments proposals for aiw*tj effective attack on discrimination. A rigorous law, making discriminationon grounds of colour or race unlawful, is clearly needed; and it must be effectively
enforced. The provisions of the Bill setting up a new statutory body with wide powers to take the initiative in uncovering discrimination, both conscious andunconscious, wiD, the Government believes, enable racial discrimination to be tackled more effectively than at present.18. The new Commission for Racial Equality wQI combine responsibilities forenforcing the anti-discrimination law and encouraging the promotion of equalopportunity with wider responsibilities for conducting inquiries into the situation of the racial minorities, for giving advice and for public education. It will thus have an important role to play not just in preventing discrimination in all itsforms but in contributing to the development of policies to tackle disadvantage.19. The Commission will be an independent statutory body with powers to conduct investigations and inquiries into the public and private sectors alike. Itwill naturally work closely with Government departments and will be free to scrutinise their policies and make criticisms when necessary. Ministers are,however, responsible for the policies and actions of their departments and areanswerable to Parliament for them. It will not, therefore, be appropriate for theCommission to have formal responsibilities for checking the monitoring activitiesof departments as envisaged in the Report. As an independent statutory bodythe Commission must be responsible for its use of its powers and the fulfilment ofits duties. While it will no doubt co-operate closely with the Select Committeeand give full weight to any recommendations which the Committee may makeabout areas m which it could profitably use its powers to conduct formalinvestigations, it would not be right for it to be under an obligation to carry out such investigations as recommended in the Report.THE SELECT COMMITTEE20. The Committee is a source of informed scrutiny and advice on race relations issues. Its inquiries have made a unique contribution to the collectionof information about race relations problems and its reports and recommen-dations have an important place in the development of policy. The Governmentis glad to pay tribute to its work and to emphasise its support for the Committee.21. Comments on each of the recommendations hi the Committee&apos;s Reportfollow in the Annex.
ANNEXOBSERVATIONS ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THESELECT COMMITTEE(I) There should be a Minister of State for Equal Rights.(2) The Home Office should remain responsible for race relations adminis-tration and the Minister for Equal Rights should be attached to the HomeOffice.* As explained in the mam reply, the Government accepts that the Home office should retain the central responsibility for race relations policy but considersthat this should be exercised through the Home Secretary and not by theappointment of a Minister of State for Equal Rights.(3) The Home Office should have a much improved establishment, concernedwith race relations and sex discrimination.The Home Office is in no doubt of the importance of race relations adminis-tration, and within the bounds of current restraints upon Government expendi-ture intends to accord a high priority to this work. The staff engaged directlyhave been increased since evidence was given to the Committee; additionalsenior staff have been provided to work on the new legislation and its conse-quences. Arrangements have also been made for the services of the Home OfficeRace Relations Adviser&apos;s unit to be available to the staff engaged upon generalrace relations administration. The Home Office accepts the view of the SelectCommittee that there is a close relationship between work to combat sexdiscrimination and work to combat racial discrimination, and its staffingarrangements will reflect this relationship. They will also reflect the importanceof maintaining close contact between this staff and those involved in workarising from Home Office responsibilities on urban deprivation.(4) The other Departments mainly affected, Employment, Education and science, and Environment-especially Environment-should strengthen their staffs dealing with race relations and review their efficacy in developingmore positive Departmental policies.The Department, of Employment has a small Headquarters Unit concernedwith race relations and a field service of race relations employment advisers(RREAs) who deal with a wide range of questions which may arise in a multi-racial workforce. Their work is kept under constant review, and the staff of theRREA service, which in April 197*5 numbered 18 including 4 part-time officers,win be further increased as resources permit.Within the Department of Education and Science, the Educational Dis-advantage Unit is the focal point for the consideration of matters connected witheducational disadvantage and the distinctive educational needs of racial min-oritjes. However, those Branches of the Department concerned with the various stages of the educational system and the supply and training of teachers haveclear responsibilities to take into account the needs of racial minorities where these affect their work. Similar arrangements apply to the work of HMInspectorate. In this case the co-ordinating function is exercised by a Chief
Inspector, a Staff Inspector and a panel of Inspectors drawn from the regionswho have a special interest in the education of persons of overseas origin. TheGovernment does not therefore consider that the interests of the communitieswith which the Select Cornmittee is concerned suffer because too little of thetime of the staff of the Department of Education and Science is devoted to them,nor is a shortage of staff the reason for the lack of statistical information towhich the Select Committee has drawn- attention-see reply to Recommen-dstioa 39. The Government acknowledges, however, the need to keep itseducation policies under continuous review in order to ensure that they take intoaccount the needs of racial minorities, and contribute as fully as possible to thegrowth of mutual respect between the races of which our society is now com-posed; in particular they consider it important that greater stress than in the pastshould be placed on training teachers, both on initial and in-service courses, toteach in a multi-racial society..The Department of the Environment already has a Division responsible forthe social aspects of housing, one of whose main tasks, with the help of theSocial Research Division, is to ensure that racial minorities are taken intoaccount in developing housing policies. The Department has recently set up a housing Services Advisory Group and it will be considering special needsincluding those of minority groups. The Department has also developed closerlinks with the Community Relations Commission and Race Relations Board. Inits observations on the Select Committee^ Report on Housing (Cmnd 6232)the Government agreed with the Committee^ view that &quot;the bousing of immigrants cannot be separated from housing the community at large&quot; andalthough the safeguarding of good race relations is taken account of in all relevant housing activities, a specialised race relations unit would not be appropriate.(5) The Department of Employment in their review should pay particular regardboth to the recent reorganisation of the Department and to the transfer ofresponsibility to industrial tribunals which we have assumed will take place.Close links exist at a number of working levels between the Department ofEmployment and the Manpower Services Commission and its Agencies on race relations matters and discussions are now taking place between the department and the Commission about how best to promote equal opportunity and removedisadvantages.The Race Relations Bill provides for complaints of racial discrimination inemployment to be dealt with by industrial tribunals. The Government has asked the TUC, the CBI and other organisations which it consults about the member-ship of tribunals to bear in mind the desirability of including members of racialminorities amongst the names they put forward.(6) The Department of Health and Social Security should have some staffsolely engaged upon the race relations aspect of Its work.The Department of Health and Social Security accepts the need for it to beresponsive to the needs of racial iniflorities. It already has professional staff withparticular responsibilities in this area and has made arrangements for the co-ordination of Departmental interests on race relations matters. However, its responsibilities extend over an exceptionally broad range of activities, both
directly as a large-scale employer in the social security field and indirectly inrelation to the whole of the National Health Service and to local authority social service departments. Issues concerning race relations may arise across the wholeof this range and staff concerned solely with race relations work would not havethe breadth of knowledge and experience to be able to deal with them adequatelywithout reference to other staff with expertise in the particular field in question.Such an arrangement, though attractive as showing the Department&apos;s concern,would in practice be wasteful and inefficient, and has therefore not been adopted.(7) The Civil Service Department should create a special Equal Opportunityof Employment Unit.It is the Governments policy that within the Civil Service there shall be no discrimination against any person eligible under the nationality rales, whether inrecruitment or promotion or in any other way, on the grounds of colour, race,ethnic or national origins. Responsibility for implementing this policy lies withthe Permanent Secretary of each Department, operating through the PrincipalEstablishment Officer, but the Civil Service Department has a central responsi-bility for overseeing the operation of the policy and ensuring its effectiveness.The Select Committees Report states that the Civil Service Department has&quot;neither a special unit nor any staff concerned with race relations&quot;. This is only partially correct. Work on race relations occupies a substantial part of the timeof a Principal with supporting staff, and of an Assistant Secretary and an UnderSecretary to whom the Principal reports. These staff, who are located within the personnel Management Divisions of the Department, advise Ministers on the implementation of race relations policy and legislation within the Civil Service;they are responsible for promulgating the Governments policy to otherdepartments and for ensuring its effectiveness; and they maintain a generaloversight of procedures for the investigation of complaints against Govera-mcnt departments under the Race Relations Act 1968. The same staff have forsome tune had similar responsibilities in relation to the employment of womenwithin the Civil Service and the implementation of the Sex Discrimination Act1975. These arrangements work well and sufficient resources are available to perform the functions effectively.The Government considers, therefore, that within the Civil Service Depari-ment satisfactory arrangements have been made for the administration andgeneral oversight of race relations policy within the Civil Service and for equalopportunity of employment generally.(8) The Race Relations Board and the Community Relations commission should be merged in a single Agency to be known as the Equal RightsCommission.The Government proposed in the White Paper on Racial Discrimination thatthe Race Relations Board and Community Relations Commission should bereplaced by a new Commission and this has been provided for in the race relations Bill now before Parliament. In the light of discussion during theStanding Committee stage of the Bill, it provides for the new Commission to becalled the Commission for Racial Equality. This Commission will have entirely new statutory responsibilities parallel to those given to the Equal OpportunitiesCommission by the Sex Discrimination Act but it will in general terms cover thesame range of issues as the present Board and Commission.
(9) Provision should be made for the appointment, in addition to the Chairman,of a small number of full-time executive members to the Commission.The Race Relations Bill provides for the appointment of members to theCommission on a full-time as well as a part-time basis.(10) Subject to the provision of common services, enforcement (the direct responsibility of a full-time Commission Member) should as far aspracticable be distinct and separate from the other functions of theCommission.The Government accepts that, so far as possible, the law enforcement role ofthe Commission should be kept separate from its responsibilities for co-ordinating local community relations work. The Race Relations Bill accordinglyprovides for the establishment of a separate committee to exercise the Corn-mission&apos;s fieldwork functions.(11) The Commission should be directly represented on any Whitehall official committee on race relations.The Government will keep in close consultation with the Commission. Likethe Race Relations Board and the Community Relations Commission the new commission will be represented on the new committee which is to advise theHome Secretary on race relations research (see reply to Recommendations 31and 32). While departments will associate the Commission with their considera-tion of race relations issues, it would not be appropriate for the Commission tohave a place as of right on official committees.(12) The Commission should have a strong regional organisation with regionalofficers; and there should be adequate staff of the high calibre required.It mil be for the Commission to decide how it may best be organised to carryout its functions within agreed financial provisions, but as the White Paper onRacial Discrimination said, it will have a number of regional offices. It will naturally be mindful of the need to recruit staff of the requisite ability and expert-ence to cany out the demanding duties placed on it.(13) The work of the community relations councils should not be transferred tothe local authorities and they should remain as local autonomous bodies with-as at present-some of their activities selectively grant-aided.(14) The Community Relations Officers should assist as advisers but not beemployed by the community relations councils.(15) The Community Relations Officers be employed and paid by the EqualRights Commission.(18) The essential character of Community Relations Officers being field officersworking in an individual capacity in very differing circumstances should berecognised by the Equal Rights Commission and it should not inhibit their local independence.The Government accepts that community relations councils should retain theirpresent autonomous status. The Race Relations Bill will empower transfer of thefieldwork responsibilities of the Community Relations Commission to the new
Commission, but the Government does not propose any change of relationship between the community relations councils, their officers and the new Commission.This relationship must be worked out in discussions between those concernedwhen the new Commission takes over its responsibilities.(16) While the Community Relations Officers should be employed and paid bythe Commission, their activities should be supported jointly by the Govern-ment and the local authorities, and increased resources be made availablefor this purpose.(17) To facilitate the funding of local race relations activities, a stautory obligation should be placed on local authorities to promote equal rights and,paying attention to the new structure of local government with its division of responsibilities between counties and districts, the funding should be on a county basis either through county precepts or agreed sharing between the districts or indeed through both.The Government accepts that the work^ of community relations officers must continue to be supported out of public funds, but cannot contemplate anygeneral increased resources in present circumstances.In providing the services for which they are responsible, local authorities in whose areas the racial minorities have settled must be sensitive to their specialsituation and the needs to which this gives rise. Full co-operation between thelocal authorities and community relations councils is essential if community relations policies are to be fully developed.The Government accepts the view that the involvement of local authoritiesshould stop short of formal responsibility for community relations councils. Theindependence of these councils, provided it is based on close co-operation withthe local authorities, can only foster a healthy dialogue. The extent to which local authorities support their community relations councils varies greatly; some are notably generous; others less so. The Government believes that localauthorities have an important part to play in tackling the problems of race relations and welcomes the support which they give to local voluntary com-rrranity relations effort. The Race Relations Bill, which has not yet completed its passage through Parliament, has a new clause added in the House ofCommons Standing Committee which gives effect to the Select Committee&apos;proposal that local authorities should be under a general duty in respect of race relations.(19) There should be regional staffs dealing with enforcement matters and, toassist them, Complaints Boards: these boards would be appointed by theCommission and would include members of each executive committee of thecommunity relations councils and each sizeable ethnic minority within their area. They would be directly under the full-time Commission memberresponsible for enforcement matters.The Commission will, like the Race Relations Board, have regional offices.Under the new legislation there will be no statutory role for local committees toexercise in relation to individual complaints of discrimination. The commission will, however, no doubt wish to draw on the experience and knowledge of localpeople active in race relations especially those who have served on the race relations Board&apos;s conciliation committees.
(20) The membership of the Commission should be of a sufficient number toinclude members of the main ethnic communities.(21)  There should be a statutory obligation on the Secretary of State in makingappointments to ensure that the Commission includes an adequate number ofmernpers from the ethnic communities-(22)  These should be similar obligation on the Commission in making appoint-merjts to the Complaints Boards, to include members from the variousethnic communities in the area.The Commission will represent the public interest as a whole. Its membersmust be selected on individual personal merit and it would be inconsistent withits role to provide for fixed quotas for persons from particular groups. TheGovernment has not therefore thought it appropriate to provide explicitly in the race Relations Bill for the appointment of minority group members; butparagraph 108 of the White Paper makes clear the Governments intention toensure that the racial minorities are substantially represented.The Commission will no doubt also ensure that the racial minorities areadequately represented on any bodies which it establishes to assist it.(23) The Equal Rights Commission in promoting grant aidedprojects, should pay&apos; especial regard to neighbourhood and self-help developments directlyaffecting individual local ethnic communities. Further we strongly recom-mend that, to encourage these communities to be more self-reliant, the active participation of these communities should be sought both in the formulationand implementation of these projects. In doing this, the Commission should concentrate upon, and give priority to, the needs of young persons, particular-ty West Indians.(36) The Equal Rights Commission should supplement the work of the HomeOffice by supporting local voluntary or unconventional projects.The new Commission will no doubt take account of the Select Committee^views when it comes to exercise its powers for grant aiding local projects.(24) A study be made of the action being taken by the Dutch Government and consideration be given to the setting up of a centre on the Dutch modelperhaps with a Community Relations Officer being seconded Jo be in charge and responsible, through an appropriate organisation, to a local community.The Dutch Government has provided detailed information which has beensupplemented by a visit to Holland by Home Office officials. It is evident that theproblems facing the Dutch Government and the circumstances in which theyoperate are markedly different from those in Great Britain. The Governmentwill, however, continue to take account of such Dutch experience as may be relevant.(25) To avoid the repetition of the frustrations, such as that caused by theneglect of the Department of the Environment to reply to the Committee&apos;!Report on Housing, the Government should declare its general support forthe work of the Committee.The Government is glad to take this opportunity to emphasise its support forthe work of the Select Committee. The enquiries which it is able to carry out in
depth into specific areas of concern, with the range of evidence obtained and the analysis and recommendations to which they lead, form a valuable contributionto the development of race relations policy and informed discussion.Special factors, which were explained to the Committee in a memorandum bythe Department of the Environment, caused serious delay in the preparation and publication of the reply to the Committee&apos;s Report on Housing. The reply was published in September 1975 (Cmnd 6232).(26) The observations of the Departments in reply to the Committee&apos;s Reportspresented to Parliament should be supplemented by the observations of theEqual Rights Commission.The Government does not consider that it would be appropriate for commentsby the Commission to form part of the departments&apos; formal replies to the reportsof the Select Committee. These are White Papers setting out the views of theGovernment. The Commission will, of course, be free to comment on thesereplies, but this should be done separately from the White Papers themselves.(27) To improve the effectiveness of the Committee, there should be a modestincrease in the Clerk to the Committee&apos;s staff and the provision of betteraccommodation.This recommendation is a matter for the House authorities who are giving ittheir careful consideration in the light of available resources.(28) The Committee should be empowered to require the Commission to makeinquiries relevant to the Committee&apos;s current activities.The Commission will be an independent body with statutory responsibilities.It will no doubt wish to work in close co-operation with the Select Committeeand be happy to assist with the Committee^ inquiries, but it cannot be made subject to a Select Committee. It must have discretion in fulfilling its duties andin deciding on its own priorities.(29) A day should be provided each Session for debate on the Committee&apos;sReports and activities.The Government has taken note of this recommendation.(30) The Home Office should discuss with the Department of Employment,which has general responsibility for e.c. social policy, means of improvingcommunications with the Commission of the European Communities andensure that the local authorities and others are kept informed of the nature and extent of the aid being provided.There has been full consultation between the United Kingdom Governmentand the Commission of the European Communities about the application of theEuropean Social Fund to migrant workers. With the help of advice from theCommunity Relations Commission the Government has also been playing its full part in discussions about the migrant workers&apos; action programme which was prepared by the European Commission and about the preparation of the resolu-tion on action in favour of migrant workers which was adopted by the Council of
Social Affairs Ministers at a meeting on 18 December 1975. The Governmentwill continue to play a full part in further work in this field.When the Council of Ministers decided in July 1974 that certain activitiesdesigned to help migrant workers should be eligible for assistance from the Fund,the Department of Employment, in consultation with the other departmentsconcerned and in particular the Home Office, submitted applications in respectof relevant expenditure in the second half of 1974 and in 1975 by the community relations Commission and the Race Relations Board and grant-aided expendi-ture by local authorities under section 11 of the Local Government Act 1966 andthe Urban Programme. The total of about  26m allocated to the UnitedKingdom from the Fund for 1974 included some  2.6m in respect of migrantworker applications. The United Kingdom was the only member state to submit a substantial application in respect of 1974. Applications for 1975 have also beenconsidered by the Commission of the European Communities and allocations tothe United Kingdom in respect of migrant workers amount to  5.1m. Appli-cations for 1976, which were submitted in the autumn of 1975, are currentlyunder consideration by the Commission.Before payment can be received, detailed claims have to be submitted to theCommission based on actual expenditure incurred on the activities for which theCommission has allocated money from the Fund. Local authorities are assisting the Government in mounting claims. A payment on account of just over  2m inrespect of the 1974 migrant worker claim has been received. Receipts from theFund are credited to the appropriate Departmental Vote or to the consolidate fund,The Government has considered that the most effective method of covering theactivities of local authorities and others is by central applications dealing with theGovernment&apos;s financing of those activities. Activities by non-public bodies areeligible for support from the Fund only if they are financially supported by apublic body and the qualifying conditions are complex. So far no applicationshave come forward from voluntary bodies in the migrant workers field for separate submission to the Fund.(31) The Equal Rights Commission should have the main responsibility for theAdvisory Committee on Race Relations [sc Research].(32) Greater attention and meaningful resources be devoted to research.The Home Secretary announced on 23 May 1975 (Official Report, Vol 892,Col 648) that he had decided that his Advisory Committee on Race RelationsResearch should be superseded by a new advisory committee, under HomeOffice chairmanship, with membership drawn from nine Government depart-ments, the Race Relations Board, the Community Relations Commission (later,the Commission for Racial Equality) and the Social Science Research Council,together with a number of experts from outside Government. The task of thenew committee will be to review research in progress relevant to race relations and to the efficacy of policies to promote equality of opportunity for colouredminorities in Great Britain, to consider the needs for further research of this kind and to make recommendations.The Government decided to make these changes primarily to strengthen the links between policy and research and believes that the effectiveness of the contribution which the new committee will make to achieving this would be
much reduced if the committee is responsible to some external agency and not directly to Government itself. It recognises the need, however, to involve any newrace relations body as closely as possible in the revised arrangements for research; and also to enable it to undertake or sponsor, of its own initiative,research relevant to its own activities. As indicated above, the Commission forRacial Equality will be represented on the new research committee and provisionfor the Commission to undertake research has been included in the Bill now before Parliament.The Government^ intention is that these revised arrangements should lead toa new assessment of research requirements in the race relations field and in thepreparation of a balanced research programme more strongly orientatedtowards the needs of departments and paying regard to the priorities recom-mended by the former Advisory Committee.The Select Committee has recognised that the relatively modest funds so farmade available under section 26 of the Race Relations Act 1968 have notbeen the only, or indeed, the main source of money for race relationsresearch. Other Government departments besides the Home Office have researchbudgets from which they can fund (and have funded) research in the race relations field; and there are other organisations, such as the community relations Commission and the SSRC Research Unit on Ethnic Relations, atBristol University, which are also active in this field. No accurate assessment is available of the total amount of money spent in this country on race relationsresearch; but it is estimated that in 1970-71 just under  150,000 was spent on research into topics with a substantial race relations component, and that in1974-75 the corresponding sum was of the order of  290,000. The Governmentnevertheless acknowledges that in the absence so far of a co-ordinated programmeof race relations research less has been spent under section 26 of the race relations Act 1968 than might otherwise have been the case. However, future expenditure on race relations research, as on other highly desirable matters,must depend on the general level of public expenditure and the priorities within that amount.(33) The Government should review the Urban Programme, its relationship to expenditure under section It of the Local Government Act 1966 and generally its effectiveness in implementing race relations policy.The Urban Programme is authorised by the Local Government Grants(Social Need) Act 1969, which empowers the Secretary of State to pay grants tolocal authorities who in his opinion are required in the exercise of any of their functions to incur expenditure by reason of the existence in any urban area ofspecial social need. The Programme has acted as a supplement to the mainsocial programmes in urban areas. Assistance has been given to a wide range of social, educational and community projects. Public expenditure on the Pro-gramme in England and Wales in 1975-76 is estimated at  24.6m.The Programme has enabled local authorities to initiate a very wide range of projects. These include nursery classes; other specialised education projects;day nurseries and other child care projects; community centres; advice centres;special accommodation projects; play projects; and projects for the care of theaged. The Programme has thus helped to meet a wide range of social need,including the special needs of particular groups such as racial minorities.
As stated in paragraph 52 of the Select Committee^ Report the Home office has always borne in mind in administering the Programme that many areas ofspecial need in our towns and cities have large numbers of commonwealth immigrants and their families, and local authorities have been reminded of their needs in the Circulars inviting applications for grant. Because of the variations in the numbers of Commonwealth immigrants in the places which have receivedgrant-aid under the Programme, and because of the wide variety in the natureof the projects grant-aided, it is not possible to say precisely what part of theassistance channelled through the Programme has been directed towardsimproving race relations or to relieving social need in areas of high immigration.But the greater part of approved expenditure has been in areas that have alsoqualified for grant under section f i of the Local Government Act 1966.Section 11 of the 1966 Act empowers the Secretary of State to pay grants tolocal authorities who make special provision in the exercise of any of their functions in consequence of the presence of substantial numbers of immigrants from the Commonwealth whose language or customs differ from those of therest of the community. Grant is payable only on expenditure in respect of theemployment of staff, Section 11 grant thus offsets the costs to local authorities of employing staff to deal with the special needs of Commonwealth immigrants,but the appropriate level of such provision is for the local authorities themselvesto determine. The grant is available for all expenditure incurred by localauthorities within the terms of section 11.Local authority expenditure in 1975-76 attracting grant-aid under section 11is estimated at  20.4m. Most of this expenditure has been incurred on the salaries of additional teachers. Grant has also been paid, however, on the costs of employing ancillary helpers in schools, educational welfare officers, social workers, public health inspectors, liaison officers, interviewing staff andinterpreters, and clerical staff. Grant is also paid on additional staffing costs in services such as children in care, day nurseries and maternity and child welfare.Grants under section 11 and under the Urban Programme are both admini-stered by the same Unit in the Home Office. This arrangement allows the planning and administration of the two grants, and the relationship betweenthem, to be kept under review. Because of the wide range of expenditureassisted through both forms of grant, the Home Office naturally acts inconsultation with other interested Government departments in administeringthem. The Urban Programme is reviewed regularly as part of the inter-departmental preparation of the Circulars which invite local authorities toapply for grant. These Circulars advise local authorities to bear in mind the availability of grants under section 11 when considering possible applicationsunder the Urban Programme.The Government agrees with the Select Committee that the Urban Pro-gramme has proved its usefulness and intends to keep the Programme underreview, so that it may be adapted to keep in touch with the development of social policies generally and in particular its relevance to the special needs of theracial minorities.(34) The Home Office should remain the Department responsible for theco-ordination of the Urban Programme, but to avoid planning difficulties,closer regard should be given to local authorities budgeting cycles.The Government notes the Select Committee^ view that the Home Office
should remain the department responsible for the co-ordination of the urban programme. The Home Office recognises the importance of enabling expendi-ture under the Urban Programme to be integrated into local authorities&apos;annual planning and budgeting cycles so that proposals for expenditure underthis head can be considered together with all the other proposals competingfor the authorities&apos; financial and manpower resources.(35) To encourage a sense of participation by the ethnic minorities themselves the Home Office should set up an Advisory Committee including members from the various ethnic communities.As explained in the Governments reply to Recommendation. 33, die urban programme assists projects covering a wide range of social need, and has notbeen restricted to the special needs of particular groups such as racial minorities.The Home Office is always ready to receive advice from the many bodies with an interest in the Programme, but does not consider that it would be appropriate to establish a formal Advisory Committee. In so far as the Programme hasincluded assistance for the special needs of racial minorities, the Home office has taken advice from the Community Relations Commission and hopes to benefit from similar advice under the new arrangements for race relationsadministration.(3T) The special Equal Opportunity of Employment Unit of the Civil service department, to avoid racial and sex discrimination in the Civil Service,should keep necessary records and survey and monitor the recruitment,promotion and establishment policies of the departments.The Government agrees that a vital ingredient of an equal opportunitiespolicy is a regular and effective system of monitoring. It has decided that to record racial or national origins on personal files would be inconsistent with its policy that racial origin is in no way relevant to membership of the Civil service or to advancement within it.Within the limits which this decision imposes, the question of monitoring the effectiveness of Civil Service procedures and practices in the fields of recruitment,career development and promotion has been discussed by the interested parties.At the invitation of the Civil Service Department and with the agreement of theStaff Side of the National Whitley Council and the Trade Union Side of theJoint Co-ordinating Committee, the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations isat present engaged in a study of equal employment procedures and practices inthe Civil Service with special reference to racial discrimination.(38) The special unit of the Department of Employment to which we havealready referred should have responsibility for giving guidance and advice to the Nationalised Industries and other public authorities and for the supervision of the provision of information and the enforcement of thenon-discrimination clauses in Government contracts.The Department of Employment already gives guidance to employers in thepublic and private sectors and discussions are now being held with those concerned about the way in which work to promote equal opportunity may bebetter co-ordinated.
As stated in paragraph 20 of the White Paper on Racial Discrimination, theGovernment intends that, when the new legislation about racial discriminationis enacted, an undertaking to comply with its provisions should be a standardcondition of Government contracts. It is also intended that it should be a standard condition that a contractor will provide on request such information about his employment policies and practices as may reasonably be required.(39) The Departments, in particular the Departments of Education and science and of the Environment, in strengthening their staffs dealing with race relations, should make the requisite provision for monitoring in particular,the education and housing authorities, and seek to make more effective use,for instance, of Her Majesty s Inspectors and the regional officers of theDepartments.Within the Department of Education and Science, the establishment of two new units the Educational Disadvantage Unit and the Assessment of Per-formance Unit-was announced in the Governmenfs Reply to the Committee*sReport on Education (Cmnd 5720). It is within the terms of reference of the educational Disadvantage Unit to inform itself of the extent and distributionof educational disadvantage and of the Assessment of Performance Unit topromote the development of methods of assessing and monitoring the achieve-ment of children at school. The joint work of the units will in time equip theDepartment and the local education authorities with appropriate ways ofmonitoring where, in the interests of extending the educational opportunities forthe disadvantaged (including those who are members of racial minorities), thisis necessary.The Government feels that the comments of the Select Committee in para-graphs 14 and 56 of the Report attach undue importance to statistics andunderestimate the amount and value of the information available to theDepartment and shared with those concerned outside it. The panel of HMInspectors referred to in the comment on Recommendation 4 co-operate withtheir colleagues to inspect schools and colleges in multi-racial areas, to adviselocal education authorities and the Department, to contribute to the in-service training of teachers and to keep in touch with the voluntary organisations. Theywork very closely with the advisers which most LEAs in multi-racial areas have appointed to their own staffs. In the last academic year the panel hascarried out a special programme of inspections on selected topics relevant to theeducation of racial minorities to discover the best practice current in various parts of the country. The Educational Disadvantage Unit has taken part in anumber of seminars held with a range of local education authorities havingsubstantial proportions of racial minority pupils on their school rolls. Steps arenow being taken to collate information about good practice in the education of immigrants and in education for race relations which will be available to authorities and schools through the new Centre for Information and Advice on educational Disadvantage. The contribution of educational research is illus-trated by the Report on &quot;Language Proficiency in the Multi-Racial JuniorSchool&quot; which the National Foundation for. Educational Research publishedlast year. This study was funded by the Department of Education and Science.So far as statistics are concerned, the Government remains firmly of the viewset out in &quot;Educational Disadvantage and the Educational Needs of Immi-grants&quot; that a count of pupils of overseas origin, however defined, would serve
no educational purpose and believes that the case against such a count holdsgood for post-school education as well. The Department of Education and science is, however, consulting the interested parties on what information might usefully be collected or collated and on the possible application of researchtechniques to acquiring a better understanding of the factors which have a significant effect on participation and performance at various stages in thesystem.The Government&apos;s view on keeping records in relation to the housing of coloured people were set out fully in the White Paper &quot;Race Relations and housing&quot; (Cmnd 6232). The Committee^ recommendation will be further considered in the light of the discussions the Department of the Environmentis to undertake.Consideration is being given to a consultation paper for issue to local authority associations, representatives of racial minorities and others about the keepingof records by local housing authorities.(40) The Equal Rights Commission should be entitled to receive Departmentalrecords and reports, relating to monitoring, and should inform the SelectCommittee on Race Relations and Immigration of any matters to whichthey think it proper to call their attention.The Government will work closely with the Commission but it would not be appropriate to give it a right of access to departmental papers over and above that which it will have under the Race Relations Bill to require the productionof documents. The Commission will no doubt wish to carry out investigationsrelating to equal opportunity in the public as well as in the private sector, andthe Government will co-operate fully with such investigations.(41) Thefull-time Commission Member with direct responsibility for enforcementshould also have a special responsibility for promoting neutral employmentpractices in the private sector.The Race Relations Bill makes provision for the appointment of full-timeCommission members, but the responsibilities of individual members will be amatter for the Commission to decide.(42) In the exercise of its own investigatory and enforcement powers, the EqualRights Commission should concentrate on cases where the incidence of discrimination has general significance and make it clear that it is so doing.The strategic role of the Commission will be to concentrate on situations ofgeneral importance. The new legislation will enable the Commission to take theinitiative in carrying out investigations into such situations without beingdependent, as the Race Relations Board is at present, on individual complaints of discrimination brought to it.(43) The Minister of State for Equal Rights in discharging his responsibilityfor both the Equal Rights Commission and the Equal OpportunitiesCommission should ensure liaison between the two bodies.(44) The specific duties and responsibilities delegated to the Equal RightsCommission should correspond to those delegated to the Equal Oppor-tunities Commission.
(45) There should be close co-operation between the two Commissions in research and educational activities; interchange of staff should be encouraged and wherevef possible, regional staffs should share the samepremises.The Race Relations Bill provides that the new Commission should have powers and duties similar to those of the Equal Opportunities Commission. TheGovernment has proposed that the codes of law against racial and sex discrimination -nation should be as similar as the different subjects warrant and the two newCommissions will no doubt wish to co-operate closely. The Home Office will encourage this. Considerable benefit will derive from co-operation on theinterpretation of the law, on methods of investigation, research and publiceducation. Sharing regional accommodation, where possible, will facilitateco-operation. Whether discrimination and disadvantage in race and sex is sufficiently similar to make the exchange of staff fruitful is something which thetwo Commissions will have to consider in the fight of experience but they will no doubt bear in mind the recommendation of the Select Committee.(46) The Home Office should consider making &quot;pump-priming&quot; grants toorganisations representative of ethnic communities.The Government recognises the problem to which the Select Committee refersand the Home Office is conscious, in the grants it makes to minority grouporganisations, of the need to foster community organisation and self-reliance.printed io England for Hot Mnjoaty&quot;, Stationery Offlca by Harrison ft Sons (London) Ltd.1926?
