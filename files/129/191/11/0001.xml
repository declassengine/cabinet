DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(76) 6127 July 1976CABINETDIRECT ELECTIONS TO THE EUROPEAN ASSEMBLYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs,        Since Cabinet last discussed this question on 8 July agreement wasreached at the European Council on the number and distribution of seats.There waa further discussion to the Foreign Affairs Council on 19/20 Julyat which a ntw situation was created by French Insistence that all member states have the same degree of commitment about the date of the firstelections.   As a result a new proposal was worked out on the followingline s fi.        The instrument giving effect to direct elections would not lay down the dates on which the first election would be held.U. There would instead be provision for the Council in due course to fix the date (acting &quot;&quot;*wJmonaly^ after consulting the Assembly,111.       The preamble to the decision would contain a &quot;best endeavours&quot; passage on the following lines;-&quot; The Councli/Intending to reaffirm the desire expressed by the EuropeanCouncil at Rome on 1 and 2 December 1975 that the election ofthe Assembly should be held on a single date within theperiod May/June 1978, and determined to do everything possible to obtain that objective, has laid down theprovisions annexed to this decision      11In practice an alternative shorter formula is likely to be preferred.Whatever the formula it will be declaratory, not binding.COPY NOSI1
2.        A further Council has been arranged on 27 July primarily to dealwith direct elections.   We will certainly come under pressure to accept this new compromise but our representative will make clear that thematter will need to be considered by Cabinet as a whole before we can move from our previous position.   We now need to consider urgently whether wecan accept that the absence of any binding commitment to a specific date for the first election removes our need for a derogation enabling us to nominate in 1978.    I believe that the proposal last week Is acceptable forthe following reasons :-a. It falls clearly within the conclusions of Cabinet on 8 July:in mat the new instrument contains a &quot;best endeavours&quot; clause in the preamble and does not lay down the dates on which the first electionshould be held.b. It removes the possibility that we might need for a time to nominate 81 Members of Parliament.3,        K we do not accept this new proposal, which our Communitypartners will see as meeting cur needs as previously stated, we shall be accused, rightly or wrongly, of holding up progress towards directelections.    As against this, we must consider the possible awkwardness ofour being held responsible for delaying elections throughout the Communityif we should be the only Member State unable to complete our preparations by May/June 1978.   I believe that the clear advantage lies inour accepting the new proposals now and facing the possibility of Isolationlater because;a. I prefer to be isolated in the Community after, rather than before, we have made progress towards a revision of theCommon Fisheries Policy,b. Other States (particularly France and Italy) seem unlikely tobe ready for direct elections in 1978.c. If  when the Council comes to consider the election date, wehave not made satisfactory Parliamentary progress with a DirectElections Bill, our resolve to stand out against the majority will be strengthened by our literal inability to meet the proposed timetable.What is now proposed is in line with the balance of Parliamentary opinon as expressed in the two-day debate on direct elections on 29/30 March.   Amajority of opinion, as reflected in the debate, favoured holding directelections in the United Kingdom at the same time as elsewhere, though agood many doubts were expressed as to whether the May/June deadline wasnot a bit too soon.
4.        I therefore recommend mat we should accept an agreement on thelines set out above, which I judge to be fully consistent with the objectivesendorsed by the Cabinet.A foreign and Commonwealth OfficeZl July 1976
