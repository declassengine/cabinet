DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 75 COPY NO      pO7 September 1976CABINETTATE AND LYLE&apos;S BID FOR MANBRE AND GARTONMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and food.        In common with the majority of my colleagues on the ministerial committee on Economic and Industrial Policy (El) I believe we should decide against referring to the Monopolies Commission any aspect of thebid which Tate and Lyle have made for Manbre and Garton.    In this paper i explain why.EXCESS REFINING CAPACITY2. The cane sugar refining industry has excess capacity of about460, 000 tons (1977) rising to 580, 000 tons in 1980.    This reflects the loss to the refineries of about 500, 000 tons of raw cane supplies (mainlyAustralian) which we used to get under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreementbut do not under e.c. arrangements; and about 100, 000 tons of raw beetsugar which in time will have to be refined in the beet factories.    running down the excess capacity will involve the loss of up to 2, 000 jobs.3.        The present capacity and work force of the six refineries are asfollows: -	Basic	No. of	Capacity	employee	(&apos;000		tons)	Tate &amp; Lyle:   London (Silvertown)	900	2, 640Liverpool	550	1,920Greenock	110	380Manbre &amp; Garton: London (Hammersmith)	130	380Ne wton-le - Willows	160	480Greenock	120	420Total: 1,970 6,220
4. The two refiners accept the scale of the excess capacity but havebeen unable to agree between themselves where capacity should be reduced.The Unions concerned argue that the Government should find additional supplies of raw sugar, to keep the present capacity employed.    Because ofour e.c. obligations and the very high cost of subsidising supplies of rawbeet sugar,   however, this is not practicable.THE GOVERNMENTS OBJECTIVES5.        The Governmenfs objective is to ensure that the necessaryreduction of capacity should take full account of employment and regional policy as well as economic considerations.    This means that, while trying to secure an efficient and competitive industry, we would prefer contractionto fall elsewhere than in central Liverpool and Greenock, where theemployment and regional development situations are particularly difficult.Officials have worked out a possible plan which would i. make no reductionof capacity in Scotland; ii. use the full capacity of the largest refinery(Silvertown); Hi.   reduce capacity at Tateis Liverpool refinery but providealternative jobs on the same site (mainly in a new chemical plant) to offsetmost of the jobs lost and avoid any enforced redundancies; and iv.   reducecapacity at Hammersmith and towards 1980 close Newton-le-Willows.This seems to those of us with industrial responsibilities to strike the bestbalance.    But the contraction it implies falls far more heavily on Manbrethan on Tate.6.        Tate&apos;s are the more interested in staying in sugar refining and havebeen the more active in exploring the possibilities of new jobs.    In mid-Aprilthey sought my views about the Governments reaction to a merger betweenthem and Manbre&apos;s, making it clear that after a merger they would beprepared to implement a plan like that in paragraph 5.    The El committee considered this in May, and agreed that Tate&apos;s should be advised to seekconfidential guidance from the Office of Fair Trading and that officials should continue to work on the plan.7.        It is suggested that we should have the views of Manbre&apos;s and theunions in order to decide which course offers the best chance of bringing about the required contraction in accord with our regional and employmentpolicies.    But this seems to me unrealistic.    It was not possible to discussthe plan above with Manbre without improperly revealing to them Tate*intention to make the bid.    It would have been apparent that the plan called for unified control; and unless Manbre accepted this, they were bound to oppose a plan which fell more severely on their own capacity.    They have however been free to put forward their own ideas for rationalisation; and thesebased on sharing the burden of contraction in the absence of a merger,involve closing one Greenock refinery and saving jobs at Newton-1 e-Willowsat the expense cf Liverpool.    This is clearly less attractive in terms of regional policy.2
8.        Similarly it has not been practicable to discuss the plan with theunions in the context of a contested bid.    They have not as yet accepted theneed for any contraction in capacity at all and this is their only common cause.    The workers in the two companies belong largely to different unions and so long as each company continues separately, the workers1 representa-tives from each refinery are bound to urge that theirs should not be the oneto be cut.    The case of those of us who would allow the bid to go ahead isthat unified control of the six refineries is an essential precondition for arationalisation plan meeting the Governments objectives.    Only then will the unions give the necessary priority to the interests of the workers in theareas of high unemployment.    Tate&apos;e dependence on Government for anadequate refining margin should ensure their co-operation for an acceptableplan.THE COMPETITION ASPECTS9.        The OFT gave confidential guidance to Tate&apos;s that it was not intendedto refer the merger as such to the Commission, but that it was not yetpossible to say whether particular aspects in regard to products other thansugar might be referred.    Reference of the sugar side is therefore not inquestion.    3ut many in the food industries argue for reference of starchesand glucose, where technical monopolies would also exist.    It is on this thatthe El Committee has been unable to agree.10.       Together with my colleagues with industrial responsibilities I opposea reference of the starch and glucose aspects because -i.       it would prevent Tate&apos;s proceeding with a merger bid which,if successful, would produce unified control of the refineries and areduction of capacity in accordance with the Governmenfs objectives.Decisions about capacity are needed urgently: they cannot awaitprolonged consideration of the bid by the Monopolies Commission;ii.       Tate&apos;s have offered undertakings which in my view fully meetconcern about monopoly aspects on the starch and glucose side.They have undertaken to continue to provide the full range of products which the two companies now provide, so long as customers wantthem.    They have undertaken that for two years they would maintainthe starch and glucose parts of Manbre as a separate identifiablebusiness;  so that if a monopoly reference were made after the merger, and divestment required, it would be practicable.    Theyhave moreover undertaken in those circumstances to co-operate with any such requirement.11.       The Minister of State, &quot;Department of Prices and consumer protection has met Tate&apos;s senior management to examine these undertakings in detail.    At his request, they have j proposed a non-statutory adjudicationbody which could oversee their undertaking to consumers.    He also requestedthem to extend the period when the starch and glucose interests were keptseparate, and they have now proposed three years instead of two.3
12.       If we nonetheless referred the non-sugar aspects of the bid, itwould of course be withdrawn.    Talks would then resume between thecompanies on the rationalisation of sugar refining.    They are unlikely to agree on proportionate capacity reductions, which would in any case run counter to our own aims.    Nor are they likely to find any basis on which theycould work together.    Negotiations would therefore quickly turn on thepossibility of Manbre selling their sugar interests only to Tate&apos;s.    But the chances of agreement on price seem poor.    Manbre would ask for a price that presupposed continued use, while Tate&apos;s would be buying only in orderlargely to close down; and Tate&apos;s would no longer be acquiring the profitablenon-sugar interests.    There could clearly be pressure on Government toinject substantial sums of money without acquiring an interest;  and if this were refused, the probability of intense competition, with the pattern ofclosures determined by market forces (yet the Government held responsibleby the unions).CONCLUSION13.       I therefore recommend that the starch and glucose aspects of the merger should not be referred.    Tatesi undertakings will, if their bidsucceeds, allow a year or 18 months&apos; experience of the competitivesituation with a merged company before a decision on a monopoly referenceneed be taken; and this would provide amply public justification for adecision not to refer now.    Meanwhile the merger would bring about unifiedcontrol of the refineries and enable the contraction of capacity to take place with full regard to vital regional and employment considerations.T F ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food7 September 1976
