THE LICENSING AND SUPERVISION OFDEPOSIT-TAKING INSTITUTIONS1. Last autumn the Government announced their decision in principle tointroduce legislation which would provide for the prior authorisation ofdeposit-taking institutions. The Government believe that institutions whichtake deposits from the general public or from the wholesale money marketsshould be subject to an adequate system of authorisation and supervision,backed by statute where necessary. The building societies and trustee savings banks are already subject to prudential supervision under statute. The primarybanking sector is already subject to supervision by the Bank of England. Thereare, however, other deposit-taking institutions which are not at present subjectto continuing supervision. The proposals in this White Paper are, therefore,directed to the improvement of those arrangements, and in particular to theextension of the system to close this gap. The Government are confident thatthe changes will both provide greater protection for depositors and strengthen the financial system generally.Tt* Need for LeptiUtion2. With certain exceptions, such as building societies, a deposit-takinginstitution in the United Kingdom requires no licence or other authorisationbefore it commences business. Nor is there any statutory regulation at itasubsequent performance. However, the Bank of England has for many yearsoperated a system of prudential supervision over banks sod its supervisoryrole, although not deriving from specific statutory authority, has long beenaccepted throughout the primary banking sector. This system has a numberof advantages. The ability of banks to adapt to changing circumstances has notbeen hindered by the comparative inflexibility which could result from a moreformalised regulatory apparatus. Furthermore, the customs and conventionsof a self-regulatory system are likely to command more willing and effectivesupport in this field than formal rules imposed by law.3. Although there is no comprehensive statutory definition of a bank in theUnited Kingdom, institutions may be given specific recognitions as baskingundertakings under a variety of statutes for the limited purpose of each statute.Under the Exchange Control Act 1947, institutions may be authorised to deal in foreign exchange; these have become known as the &quot;authorised banks&quot;.Institutions recognised as banking or discount companies under paragraph 23to the Eighth Schedule of the Companies Act 1948 may in producing theirpublished accounts exercise the right to maintain hidden reserves. Institutionsrecognised as banks under Section 127 of the Companies Act 1967 are exempted from those provisions in the Protection of Depoahon Act 1963 which dealwith advertising and the submission of accounts. Institutions recognised asbanks under Section 123 of the Companies Act 1967 are exempted from theprovisions of the Moneylenders Acts. Finally, institutions recognised as banksunder Section 54 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 have theright to pay and receive interest gross of tax. These recognitions do not in themselves imply anything about the financial.standing of the institutionsconcerned, although in practice the first three have normally been granted only
to institutions belonging to the primary banking sector. This pr^Hferation ofrecognitions with differing criteria and coverage causes confusion, which iscompounded by the inadequacies of the present arrangements for regulating the use of the word &quot;bank&quot; and its derivatives in corporate names and descrip-tions. This makes it difficult for depositors to distinguish between the differentcategories of deposit-taking institution, not all of which are subject to continuingsupervision by the Bank.4. The events of late 1973 and 1974 demonstrated these defects. A number ofthose companies which found themselves in difficulties were deposit-takinginstitutions not regarded as banks by the Bank of England and were thus not subject to its supervision. Many of them, however, were recognised underSection 123 of the Companies Act 1967, and- frequently described themselves as banks in promotional material. But the Department of Trade had insufficientpowers to supervise them, since the Protection of Depositors Act 1963 protecteddepositors merely by providing for the publication of accounts in specifiedforms and by imposing certain not very effective limitations on advertising; it did not provide for the continuing prudential supervision of institutions falling within its scope. This state of affairs scarcely conformed to the minimumdesirable standards of consumer protection. However, arrangements weremade through the support operation known as the &quot;lifeboat&quot; to safeguard thedeposits of the public in a large number of cases where deposit-takinginstitutions ran into difficulties.5. The Government believe that these deficiencies should be remedied.The new arrangements,which they intend to introduce are described below. TheywnT meet the United Kingdoms obligations under the eec&apos;s prospectivedirective on the commencement and carrying on of business by banks andother credit institutions.Uctftffag6. Under the new system, institutions will be allowed to carry on thebusiness of taking deposits only if they hold a licence granted by the Bank ofEngland, unless they are either recognised as a bank under the new arrange-ments described in paragraph 9 below, or are covered by one of the existing statutory schemes referred, to in paragraph 13 below. In order to obtain andhold a licence, institutions will also be required to comply with certain general conditions laid down in the legislation and with published prudential criteriawhich wifl be determined by the Bank of England with the agreement of theTreasury. Although the Government have already formed some view aboutthe nature of these criteria they do not think it would be right to settle thedetails in advance of consultations with those most closely affected.7. No company will be granted a licence unless its capital and reservesexceed a minimum figure. The Government wMl have to strike a balance, in fixing the figure, between the need for it to be high enough to provide sufficientassurance of financial substance and the seed for it not to be so high that itconstitutes&apos; an undue deterrent to otherwise suitably qualified persons who wishto enter the deposit-taking field. Institutions will also have to satisfy the Bank ofEngland that their management is honest, trustworthy and suitably qualified toundertake the kind of business which they intend to conduct In deciding
whether to grant a licence to an existing institution, the Bank of England willalso look at its past performance and will assess whether it is likely to be able tomeet the standards of liquidity and solvency appropriate to a deposit-takinginstitution,8. Institutions which receive a licence will thereafter have to satisfy the Bankof England that they continue to meet those criteria and conform to the requiredstandards in conducting their business. In assessing a deposit-talcing institution^business, the Bank will examine appropriate balance sheet relationships andratios relating to the capital adequacy and liquidity of the institution, the degree of risk attaching to various assets, the matching of liabilities and assets in both sterling and other currencies, the reliance placed on deposits fromconnected companies and the institution^ lending to connected organisations,the distribution of its lending among economic sectors and the provisions and profits that have been made. This information win be interpreted flexibly taking account of the particular circumstances of each institution.. The Bank willbe able to attach further conditions to the granting and renewal of licencescovering such matters as the appointment of directors or management, and theinjection of extra capital. They will be able to revoke or suspend a licence if theyconsider that the company no longer meets the standards required of a deposit-taking institution. There will be a right of appeal to the Treasury against the refusal or revocation of a licence.Recognition as a Bank9. The Bank of England will be empowered to grant a new statutoryrecognition as a bank to certain deposit-taking institutions which wfl) exemptthem from the licensing provisions of the Act. Exacting criteria for suchrecognition, covering such matters u minimum capital and reserves, tb&amp;typeorrange of banking services required to be provided, and the repotatwe orstatus needed, will be determined by the Bank with the agreement of theTreasury and will be published. It is expected that most of theinritations whichcomprise the present primary banking sector will qualify far such recogartfotkThe arrangements for their supervision will remain rmHmny\ ahfceiwfe tea tfe*considerably strengthened manner that has recently been   introduced ie response to the experience of the carry 1970*s. There will be a right of appeal to theTreasury against the refusal or revocation of this recognition.    fBanking Names and Advertising10. The Government intend to extend the existing controls over the use ofthe word &quot; bank &quot; and its derivatives. Recognised hanks-will be permitted to use the word &quot; bank &quot; in their name and to describe themselves as bankK. cr ascarrying on the business of banking; hcented institutions will not. The national savings Bank and the trustee savings banks, will be permitted to continue to use the word ** bank &quot;. The proposed legislation will also empower the Trewary,acting in consultation with the Bank of England, to issue regulations governing the content and form of advertising for deposits: this wiH replace the comparableprovisions in the Protection of Depositors Act
DepoaH Protection FortIt. In any system of prudential supervision a balance must be struckbetween ensuring on the one hand that deposit-taking institutions conduct their affairs with an appropriate degree of caution, and on the other that theyare free to explore and develop new areas of business which may be profitablenot only to the institutions themselves but also valuable to the economy as awhole. No supervisory system can exclude altogether the possibility of an institution finding itself in difficulties. The Government, therefore, propose to institute a mandatory deposit protection fund which will provide the public withan additional safeguard against the loss of deposits. The Government are stillconsidering the details of the scheme, but they intend that it should relate to sterling deposits up to  10,000 (or the first  10,000 of larger deposits) with alllicensed deposit-takers and recognised banks. The fund wUt be administered bythe Bank of England.Northern Ireland1Z Financial institutions in Northern Ireland are subject to statutorycontrols similar to those in force in Great Britain. Some of these are administered by Northern Ireland departments under powers conferred by separate legis-lation; others are administered on a United Kingdom basis. The Governmenthave decided that the proposed licensing and supervisory system will apply inNorthern Ireland as in Great Britain through a single Act of ParliamentExcf-iocsBvti&amp;tg Societies, Giro, Trustee Savings Banks and Friendly Societies13. The supervisory arrangements described above will not cover thebuilding societies, trustee savings banks, the National Savings Bank, the NationalGiro and friendly societies which are already satisfactorily regulated and super-vised under statute. But the trustee savings banks have recently begun a trans-formation procew which will, over the next few years, enable them to expandprognxsrnsly their range of banking services. The Government envisage thatthey will be brought within the Arrangement] proposed in this White Paper atthe appropriate stage in their development The arrangements will also not applyto stockbrokers who are regulated by the Council of the Stock Exchange.&quot; Deposit s &quot; with Estate Agents and Traders14. &quot; Deposits &quot; will be defined in the legislation in a way which will excludepart payments for future acquisitions or services. The legislation will, therefore,not apply to deposits taken by solicitors, estate agents and a wide range of othertraders who take deposits as such part payments.Braadn.   Ora-ma Dcpoefc-Ttktig iBStttrtor-15. Branches of overseas deposit-taking institutions operating in the Unitedkingdom will, like deposit-takers incorporated in this country, need to hold atieence or be recognised as a bank in order to take deposits. The Bank will be concerned to ensure that they conform to appropriate standards in the conductof their business, but the arrangements for their prudential supervision willremain primarily a matter for the supervisory authorities in the country of origin.Branches of overseas deposit-taking institutions will not be required to have
separate endowment capital in the UK. Branches of overseas deposit-takinginstitutions with head offices elsewhere in the e.c. which are licensed in the UKmay be entitled to use the banking names by which they are known in theircountry of origin.Transrtioa and Spedal Cases16. The new system will apply both to institutions wishing to take depositsfor the first time and to deposit-taking institutions in existence at the time theAct comes into force. The latter will be given an adequate period, probablytwelve months after the Act receives the Royal Assent, in which to meet the newrequirements. The Bank of England will be prepared to discuss with any of the institutions affected its prospects of obtaining a licence or being granted re-cognition as a bank.17. Certain institutions which carry on the business of taking deposits andwhich are not supervised under existing legislation, for example credit unions,certain retail co-operatives, municipal or local banks and the Scottish uncertifiedsavings banks, may not fit easily into the proposed arrangements. The Govern-ment will, therefore, hold consultations with these and any other groups of in-institutions which may find it difficult because of their special circumstances tocomply with the requirements of the proposed legislation.Inebriation18. The Government have already begun to rationalise the existing statutorybanking recognitions. Once the Consumer Credit Act 1974 is fully in operation,the Moneylenders Acts and Section 123 of the Companies Act will be repealed.The implementation of the proposals outlined above will involve the repeal ofthe Protection of Depositors Act and of Section 127 of the Companies Act 1967.The provisions of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 in respect ofinstitutions carrying on banking business in the United Kingdom will be amend-ed in due course to take account of the new system. However, the existing systemof authorisation under the Exchange Control Act 1947 will continue separately,since that has to take into account additional criteria specifically relating toforeign exchange business. The existing recognitions which have been granted in the past for the purposes of the Eighth Schedule of the Companies Act 1948will continue, pending review of the provisions. Once the new arrangementscome into force, the status of any deposit-taking institution will be clear fromits designation under the new legislation. No institution will be permitted totake deposits unless it satisfies the criteria in the legislation about financial stability and probity. The Government hope to introduce the legislation to giveeffect to these proposals as soon as the Parliamentary timetable permits.Parliamentary Accountability19. The general arrangements for supervision will be subject to Parliamentaryscrutiny in three ways. The framework will be laid down in the legislation. the criteria to be used by the Bank in deciding whether individual institutions shouldbe licensed or recognised as banks will be agreed between the Bank and the
Treasury; they will be laid before Parliament when they are originally prescribed,and as and when they are varied to meet changing circumstances. Finally, theBank will report annually on the exercise of its supervisory responsibilities: these reports will be laid before Parliament, and will thus be available to the SelectCommittee on Nationalised Industries. There will, therefore, be full account a-bility to Parliament through Treasury Ministers for the operation of the overallsystem by the Bank. The handling of individual cases will be a matter for theBank; Treasury Ministers will not be in a position to answer questions on them,unless there is an appeal, which will be subject to a statutory inquiry within themeaning of the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1971.CmcdbIiiii20. The Government believe that these reforms will be widely welcomedwithin the financial community. By better protecting the interests of depositors,the new arrangements will increase confidence in the strength of the financialsystem and help to ensure that it will be able in the future to make an even greater contribution to the national economy.MtteA *&quot; BMand lot Htr Mt&amp;tft Sutfomrj OSes by WUHwu Lm, LondonDd 392469 K32 8/76ISBN 0 10 165840 0
