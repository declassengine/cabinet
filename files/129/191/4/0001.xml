DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government cp(76) 54 COPY NO gj16 July 1976CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE - TREATMENT OF PUBLICLY-OWNEDINDUSTRIES AND COMPANIESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. In our discussion of public expenditure on 15 July the question was raised whether a different classification should be adopted for the capitalexpenditure of the British National Oil Corporation (BNOC).   The treatmentof the public corporations generally in our published figures of expenditure and borrowing is a matter to which the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and Ihave been giving thought for some time, and on which we commissioned work from officials for reasons unconnected with the present proposals to reducepublic expenditure next year.   As a longer-term matter I am personallyconcerned that we should move away from a presentation of these figures which puts us in an unnecessarily bad light internationally.2.        I enclose a note by the Treasury indicating some possibilities for adifferent treatment of the various publicly-owned industries and companies in our public expenditure figures.   Some of the more radical possibilitieswould involve more than changes of classification and presentation.   Forinstance, if we were to publish figures in terms of the Government moneyprovided to public sector industry, rather than in terms of their investment expenditure, however financed, this would not only put a new emphasis on government lending as an instrument of control - and there might be a gooddeal to be said for this - but, if forward projections of these plans were to appear at all, the Departments and industries concerned would have toprepare financial forecasts for a considerably longer period ahead thanthey have so far been accustomed to do.3.        I am sure that this work should be pushed ahead so as to enable us toadopt a more satisfactory presentation as soon as possible, but I cannotcommit myself now to any of these more radical new departures In time forthe public expenditure White Paper next autumn, and I am quite clear thatto extemporise an ad hoc new arrangement confined to BNOC only would be out of place and would have the reverse of the desired effect presentationally.The one rearrangement which doeB seem to me a distinct possibility for1
adoption this year, and which I should regard ae an important step in theright direction, would be to exclude the nationalised industry figures fromthe general public expenditure totals in the autumn White Riper, and to showthem separately, probably In the same White Paper, this time at any rate,but possibly in a White Paper relating solely to the nationalised industryprogrammes.4.       However, I am sure that even this could redound to our discredit It itwere open to criticism as a means of presenting our public expenditurereductions in a better light than is justified by the  acts and of suppressing an awkward addition to the last White Paper figures.   Therefore I feel that theprospect of making a change on these lines depends in the first instance onour securing a neutral result, so to speak, in our decisions on the nationalised industry programmes as compared with the last White Paper.That is to say, any additions would have to be balanced by savings withinthe same set of programmes.   Even then I have little doubt that therewould be further technical and statistical complications to be dealt with butI should hope that, subject to the important proviso which I have just made,these could be overcome.D W treasury Chambers16 July 1976
PUBLIC KXPj^IDlinJRE - TREATMENT OF PUBLICLY OWNED industries and COMPANIESNote by The TreasuryTreatment^ in^the Public Expenditure Survey1.   The public expenditure Surveys and White Papers include, in   --Programme 5, the capital expenditure programmes of the nationalised industries (irrespective of the way in which they are financed) becausethese constitute the expenditure and resources which&apos; the government control in this field.Programme 4 includes loans and grants to private sector companies(not their capital expenditure which is financed by other means)because this constitutes the expenditure which the Government controlsand the proportion of resources which it contributes.3-      There io now an increasing number of companies such as BLMCor BNFL which, unlike the nationalised industries, are governed by theCompanies Act and not by separate statutes, but in which the Governmenthas a 100% or a majority shareholding.   These have so far been treated in the national accounts&apos; as part of the private sector, and loans and grants to them are also included in Programme 4 of the public expenditure Survey.4.     A proposal is now being considered to bring together the nationalised industries and the publicly controlled companies in thenational accounts in a new public trading sector.   The public expenditure Surveys- and White Papers aim to be on the same basis as the national accounts so far as possible, but they do not haveto be in any particular case where a different treatment is morejustifiable for the purposes of control of expenditure and allocation of resources.   Whether or not the nationalised industries and the publicly controlled companies were brought together in thenational accounts, for public expenditure purposes one could eitheradopt the existing Programme 4 treatment for all these bodies, showing1
only tho Government money providc-d, or the Programme 5 treatment,      \allowing trie whole of the capital programmes concerned;    though itwould &quot;be rcore suitable to do so in conjunction with a change in thenational accounts.i5.     Such a change is, however, unlikely to come to fruition thisyear.   An earlier change could be made for public expenditurepurposes, if all the implications could be worked out in time for presentation of these programmes and of the public expenditure figul&apos;e&apos;as a whole;    we should also have to v,&apos;ork out the necessary changes iBplanning and forecasting and agree them with the industries concern^&apos;In some respects the practical problems of a new regime on these       1lines could be more difficult than those of the existing systembecause, while investment programmes can be projected for a period ^years ahead within reasonable limits, financing flows are much notevolatile, so that medium-term projections of lending to the nationalised industries could be much more speculative than medium-term projections of investment programmes.6.     There is no possibility whatever of working out new arrangement5of this kind in time for any statement on public expenditure beforethe Recess, and it would be optimistic to expect that they could beintroduced in the regular public expenditure White Paper this Autuff11&apos;It would be disastrous, from the point of view of relations with t&amp;*Expenditure Committee, to attempt to do so without clearing the netfpresentation with them, and particularly so if the Committee belief that the point of the presentational change was artificially toreduce public expenditure.   A more feasible course would be to makea clear distinction in the Autumn White Paper between central andlocal government expenditure programmes and industrial investment programmes, which would be shown separately.Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR)7. By definition the figures for the public sector borrowing requirement which appear in the Red Book (the annual FinancialStatement and Budget Report) represent the borrowings (not the2
expenditure or the investment programmes) of public sector bodiesfrom all sources.   The introduction of a new public trading sectorclassification would not in itself reduce the PSBR (it would, if anything, increase it), but it would provide the occasion for a fairly radical change in the presentation of the Budget figures.Emphasis could be laid on the general Government borrowing requirement, which would exclude borrowing by the trading sector&quot;from the private sector and abroad, or on the general government financial balance, which excludes all borrowing for on-lending.But a great deal of further work remains to be done on this subject.-  BNOC8.     It would be difficult to exclude BNOC from the public expenditureSurveys and White Papers (in advance of any wider new arrangement) asbeing a new departure requiring a different treatment because -(a) . it was included in last year&apos;s Survey and White Paper(Cmnd. 6595, page 48);(b) even if (a) were not the case, to exclude new nationalised industries would mean leaving out the aircraft and ship-building industries also, when they are nationalised, andthere would be no logic in this.(c) There are no clear grounds of substance for differentiatingBNOC from other nationalised industries for this purpose.9.     The fact that 3$0C is capable of financing its capital requirements by overseas borrowing would not be a sufficient reasonfor taking it out of Programme 5 which, as explained above, sets outinvestment programmes and not the method of financing them.   Manyof the other nationalised industries have raised large overseasborrowings, but this has not been^ regarded as grounds for excluding3
coma dentialtheir investment projrrotiTnes from the public expenditure Surveys-Even if BiiOC investment were taken out of the public expenditure figures, it would still contribute to the fGBR unless HKOC were removed completely from the public sector and obtained its fundsdirect; from the private sector and abroad and not from theNational Loans Eund.10.   It would be possible for the Government to announce reductions in public expenditure programmes other than the nationalised industries on the basis that the nationalised industries ore thesubject of a separate but related review of investment programmes,the results of which would be announced separately.   But, if it transpired that the expenditure plans of the nationalised Industriehad increased as compared with the previous V/hite Paper,  it wouldapparent that the net reductions in total public expenditure were less than the Government had claimed.    Similar considerations would hold good if the Government were to announce reductions in public &apos;expenditure programmes with the sole exception of BNOC, but thegrounds for excluding BKOC alone would be even weaker than forexcluding the whole group of nationalised industries.4
