DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;5 government cp(76) 56 COPY NO   3321 July 1976CABINETTHE EMPLOYERS&apos; INSURANCE CONTRIBUTION ANDTHE PACKAGEMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer.        I said in my paper of 13 July (CP(76) 52) that mere was a powerfulfeeling in the Party, which I am sure we in the Government share, that thismonths package must at least be sufficient to do the job; it mustre-establish confidence in sterling and improve our prospects of financing the balance of payments deficit, sufficiently to spare us a repetition withina few months.THE PACKAGE SO FAR2. I have been considering whether the elements of the package as theyare now emerging are likely to meet this requirement.    My statement willsay:i. That if the economy develops as we expect, we intend thatthe public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) for 1977-78 shouldbe in the region of  9 billion.ii. That we expect the re-expansion of the economy to reducethis year&apos;B PSBR of  ll  billion by something approaching  1 hLUionin 1977-78.iii. That we propose public expenditure reductions of  1 billion In1977-78 which (depending on the final make up of the package) will reduce the 1977-78 PSBR by about   0. 9 billion.iv. That we stand ready, by tax action next April if necessary,to complete the PSBR reduction to about  9 billion.The latest forecast of the 1977-78 PSBR after ii., but before iii. sad iv,is  10. 6 billion,   iii. reduces mat to  9.7 billion.  The implication would therefore be that further action under iv. to produce a PSBR reductltm of  700 million would be necessary - equivalent to tax increases of over  1 hI made it clear in my paper of 13 July (paragraph 7) mat mis would still benecessary after expenditure cuts of  1000 million.1secret
SHOULD WE STRENGTHEN IT?3,        There is a serious risk that a statement consisting of i. to iv. inparagraph Z would not be sufficient.    I am quite dear, as I said in myearlier paper, that the commitment to  9 billion for the PSBR. in 1977-78,qualified in the way suggested above, is the bare minimum required to restore confidence.   Assuming that we agree on the  1 billion of public expenditure cuts, we shall have   0.9 billion of bard action and the balance in forecasts (inevitably uncertain) and promises for the future.    It seems likely that the market has already largely discounted the  1 billion of public expenditure reductions.    Moreover there are serious risks in living for months to come with an implied commitment to  1 billion of tax increases in the 1977 Budget.   Overseas observers might take die view, understandably,that these increases whan they come would destroy the chances of furtherpay restraint, and discount the package accordingly.   And the possiblereduction in real take home pay implied would certainly add substantially to the difficulties of the trade unions in continuing pay restraint.   I conclude that we need to strengthen the package with some further hard action.   this cannot of course be in substitution for any part of the  1 billion public expenditure reductions.    Jt must be additional to that.4.        For the reasons given in my earlier paper I do not believe that thisextra element can take the form of income tax increases or increases inindirect taxes on consumers to be announced now.    There is however one formof tax action open to us which it is natural and necessary to announce well inadvance and which has less impact on the Retail Price Index (RPI) and addsless to unemployment than other taxes.   The table of illustrative tax changesin the Chief Secretary^ paper attached to CP(76) 53 showed that an increase Inemployers&apos; national Insurance contributions add only about half as much to theprice level and to unemployment for a given reduction in the PSBR as anincre&amp;Be in Value Added Tax (VAT) or in tobacco or alcohol dutleB.EMPLOYERS1 CONTRIBUTIONS5,        In these difficult circumstances I propose that we should strengthen the package by announcing a surcharge of 2 per cent on employers&apos; national insurance contributions operative from 6 January 1977.   Operation from6 January 1977 would ensure a full year&apos;a yield in 1977-78; there is a delay of six weeks between operative date and first receipt of the increased contributions.    The latest estimates I have of the impact of such a changeare;- ^Revenue, full year: 1977-78  1050 milUon*PSBR: 1977-78                                                    - 600 million iRPI: 4th quarter after the change (end 1977)                 1% 1Real: Gross Domestic Product (GDP): 4th quarter \after the change                                            - 0.4*4 ]Unemployment; 4th quarter after the change      * 12,000 j* Exclude s receipts from non-trading public sector.

6.        Thia contribution surcharge would require legislation in the autumn,which would also have to divert the proceeds from the National insurance fund.   There are two main ways of proceeding.   One would be to treat the surcharge as a new and separate tax which simply used for convenience the existing machinery for collecting national insurance contributions.7,        The other would be to treat we 2 per cent as an Increase in thepart of the national insurance contribution which is regarded as being to relief of National Health Service expenditure.    This National health service (NHS) element of the contribution was fixed at 1 per cent(employer 0,6 per cent, employee 0,4 per ce.it) in April 1975, when it was intended as the rough equivalent of a contribution hitherto fixed in money terms rather than as a percentage.   It now yields about  350 million ayear.    If this route for the 2 per cent increase were chosen, the employers&apos;contribution would become 2.6 per cent (employee 0.4 per cent).   The totalyield would still be less than 20 per cent of the  5.6 billion at 1976 survey prices which is the forecast cost of the NHS in 1977-78.    Thia route would bring us more nearly into line with the much higher level of employercontributions to health and social security services common in other european countries (see Annex) but it would not in fact make more resources available for the NHS and would not be intended to do so.   I invite mycolleagues&apos; views between the two routes.    I rule out a third route, whichwould be to credit the increased contributions to the National Insurance fund and reduce the Exchequer contribution to match; that would open upargument on the basis of financing me National Insurance scheme.8.        The 2 per cent surcharge would carry through into export costs butgiven the proportion of labour costs in total costs would probably add1 per cent or less- this is acceptable given the improvement incompetitiveness due to the depredation of sterling.   A more serious difficulty is the impact on industry.   Initially the surcharge would reduceindustrial liquidity.   After an interval it would b. passed on in pries withthe usual mark up where market conditions allowed.   We would have to expect an adverse reaction from industry, which is particularly hostOe topayroll taxation, and this reaction could make it more difficult *****Confederation of British Industry (CW) to co-operate fully m the todu^ialstrategy.    Industry could point out that, allowing for the composition ofthe public expenditure reductions, the biggest initial impact of the packagewas on the company sector.   Nevertheless there would be real benefit,for industry in a more convincing package.   If the package succeed, there could be relief to interest rates because of the reduction of the PSBR.Industry would also stand to gain from removal of uncertainty and of       - .&quot;ovenSng- of tax increases for the W77 Budget.   The Trade. ^(TUC) for their part are likely to be less hostile.   They argueJtafc *ifew*done too much so far for company profits.

Certatoly,       ^charge would be much more acceptsto them than other increases in direct or indirect taxation.3
conclusion.        I cannot be certain that a package strengthened with the Z per centsurcharge would achieve all we hope from it, but I must tell my colleagueithat without the surcharge there is a serious risk mat the package will prove insufficient.    With the  1 billion of expenditure reductions and the surchange we are making final and specific decisions which will reducethe PSBR to the target figure of  9 billion in 1977-78.    That should give us a very much better chance of success with the package.    I propose thatwe add this proposal to my statement.D W treasury Chambers21 July 19764
