REPORT OF THE WORKING party on THE PRACTICE OFGENETIC MANIPULATIONPresented to parliament by the Secretary of State for Education and Scienceby Command of Her MajestyAugust 1976LONDONHER MAJESTVS STATIONERY OFFICESOp net cmnd. 6600
The Right Hon. Frederick W. Mulley, MPDear Secretary of State,I have pleasure in submitting the report of the Working Party that youappointed in August 1975 to follow up the recommendations of the AshbyReport on the Experimental Manipulation of the Genetic Composition ofMicro-Organisms and, in particular, to draft a code of practice and to make recommendations on the establishment of a central advisory service.We have consulted many of the individuals and organisations likely to be concerned with the techniques of genetic manipulation and we believe thatthere is a pressing need for the implementation of a system of advice and control for experiments in this field, in order that valuable work may proceed bothrapidly and safely. We trust therefore that you will agree to publish thisreport and that you will give consideration to our recommendation that thecentral advisory service that we propose should be set up as quickly as possible.Yours sincerely,Professor Sir Robert WilliamsJune 1976.

t.  introduction.1 Following the report of Lord Ashby&apos;s Working Party,&apos; which assessedthe benefits and hazards of techniques of genetic manipulation, we were appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Science, in consultationwith his colleagues, with the following terms of reference:&quot;In the light of the reports of the Advisory Board for the Research Councils&apos;Working Party on the potential benefits and potential hazards associatedwith the genetic manipulation of micro-organisms* and of the working party on the Laboratory Use of Dangerous Pathogensf-(a) to draft a central code of practice and to make recommendations forthe establishment of a central advisory service for laboratories using thetechniques available for such genetic manipulation, and for theprovision of necessary training facilities;(b) to consider the practical aspects of applying in appropriate cases the controls advocated by the Working Party on the Laboratory Use ofDangerous Pathogens.&quot;We have met nine times and have received evidence from the bodies and individuals listed in Appendix 1, of whom some met the Working Party andsome submitted written evidence. We are grateful to our witnesses for the trouble they took to let us have their views, which have helped us in ourconsiderations.1.2 We record our warm appreciation of the work of our two secretariesDr. E. J. Herbert and Dr. C. N. J. Port, whose assistance and skill have con-tributed substantially to our considerations, and of the help we have had fromthe presence at our meetings of Mr. EC. N. Burns (Agricultural research council), Dr. D. O. Haines (Health snd Safety Executive) and Dr. T. Vickers(Medical Research Council). We also (hank Miss Lynda Ison of the Depart-ment of Education and Science who typed most of our working papers and theseveral drafts of our report.1.3 We have concentrated our attention on work involving the creation ofnew genetic dements by methods such as those described in the Ashby Reportwhereby restriction enzymes or comparable biochemical methods are used toprepare fragments of nucleic acid and to link them into the genomes of viableheterologous organisms in which they are capable of continued propagation^This excludes genetic manipulations carried out by previously establishedmethods that in principle simply add special selective methods to geneticchanges that must occur in nature. We briefly considered the implications of the probable eventual use of genetic manipulation techniques in large-scalemanufacturing processes and concluded that this use is so remote that theincrease in knowledge preceding such development will greatly contribute totheir safety. The Government may need at a later stage to reconsider our proposed control measures in the light of such developments but we have concentrated in the present report on the types of laboratory experiment thatwe can foresee being undertaken in the next few years.  We agree with the* Report of the Working Party on the Experimental Manipulation of the GeneticComposition of Micro-Organisms (Cmnd S880, HMSO, January 1975).t Report of toe Working Party on the Laboratory Use of Dangerous Pathogens (Grind6034, HMSO, May 1975).t References in this report to &quot;genetic manipulation&quot; are to be read in this limited sense.
conclusion of the Ashby Working Party that genetic manipulation using-restriction enzymes offers opportunities of great potential value and we are anxious to provide guidance on the appropriate conditions for such work as quickly as possible. It should be recognised moreover that the techniques we*have been asked to consider are not the only ones that may have associatedhazards. However, a variety of other genetic techniques leading to the intro-duction of new characteristics into cells have been employed for many yearsand such epidemiologies! surveys as have been conducted show no evidenceof hazard.1.4 The underlying reason for the present review, and of course for theestablishment of the Ashby Working Party, was the concern of the scientificcommunity that some experiments involving the techniques of genetic manipula-tion might lead, perhaps inadvertently or in an unpredictable manner, to therelease of harmful products into man, animals or plants. It should be stressedat the outset that most of the hazards that may be involved are conjectural.At present there is no experimental evidence that some of the most serioushazards that can be envisaged for example those due to the incorporation ofdeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from oncogenic viruses, or from bacteria carryingmammalian DNA, into the human body are real; but equally there is noproof that they are not. It is clear however that the introduction of drugresistance into a drug-susceptible pathogenic bacterium could have serious consequences if the organism should escape. Until further knowledge isgained of the use of the novel genetic techniques under discussion, it seems tous essential that rigorous precautions, based on the best estimate of possiblehazard, should be observed by all laboratory workers using these techniques.We therefore consider that work in this field should be done only under appro-priate containment conditions and to this end we have devised a set of guide-lines for categorising experiments (Section 2 below) that take account both ofthe conjectured hazards and of methods available for biological containment;and we have drawn up a code of practice (Section 3 below and Appendix II)for the operating procedures and physical containment levels appropriate to each category of experiment.1.5 In the present slate of knowledge of the field, containment measures should allow a suitable margin of safety until any areas of doubt can be clarifiedby further experimental evidence. We see a need for a flexible approach and consider this will be better met by requiring those who plan to work in the field of genetic manipulation to submit their experimental protocols to a central advisory group referred to below as the Genetic Manipulation AdvisoryGroup (GMAG)-for advice on the appropriate safety precautions, ratherthan by imposing rigid guidelines. We define certain cases in which work should not proceed until the GMAG has given approval and we can envisagecircumstances in which the group could advise against the conduct of a particularexperiment because of the possible hazard, or could propose modifications ofthe experimental procedures or safety precautions. As work proceeds, theexperience gained should quite quickly build up into a body of &quot;&quot;case law&quot; onwhich future experimental protocols could draw, and the GMAG should gainvaluable expertise not only in the design of safe experiments but also in related matters such as training, health monitoring and epidemiologies! studies andthe role of safety committees and safety officers.1.6 Conscious of the restraint already shown by the scientific community, andof the importance of work in this field, we consider that certain types ofexperiment (ie those falling into categories I and II defined below), which would
not in our view carry a serious hazard, should proceed subject to the precautionsrecommended below and subject to the filing of an experimental protocol withthe GMAG. Work in other categories for which adequate higher degrees ofcontainment are available should, subject to the advice of the GMAG, be encouraged, both for its intrinsic importance and to increase understanding ofthe techniques and of any associated hazards. We recommend that further work should be done on the development and characterisation of disabledorganisms which will offer an important safeguard against hazard and that anysuch organisms that are developed should be made freely available to all workers in the field.1.7 We define in the remainder of our report and in the code of practicemeasures that we consider necessary to ensure that work proceeds as safely aspossible. These include the provision of training, the involvement of localsafety committees and biological safety officers, the establishment and operationof the GMAG and the application of a central code of practice, and could beput into early operation on a basis of voluntary co-operation by laboratories.We believe that these measures will provide a system to safeguard the public;the working of the system in practice will also enable the Government to con-sider the desirability of introducing statutory powers additional to existing powers, such as those in the Health and Safety at Work Act.1.8 We have of course been aware of consideration of this subject similar toour own in other countries, particularly at the National Institutes of Health inthe United States of America, and within various international scientificorganisations. We believe that our own proposals for categorisation ofexperiments are generally in fine with those developing in the United Statesalthough we envisage that the central advisory body the GMAG in theUnited Kingdom should advise on all experiments in genetic manipulationwherever these are carried out. We support the view expressed in variousplaces that there should be some international action to ensure widespreadconsultation and even co-ordination of principles on a world-wide basis,perhaps through the World Health Organisation, which we understand has begun to consider the question. This course would be for the Government to pursue, but in the meantime we recommend that there should be no delay in implementing the system of advice and control which we believe to be necessaryin the United Kingdom.2.  CATEGORISATION OF EXPERIMENTS2.1 It is a central feature of our recommendations that all experiments involvinggenetic manipulation should be considered by the Genetic ManipulationAdvisory Group (GMAG), which will assess the hazards- and will categoriseexperiments according to the appropriate level of physical containment andother safety precautions. The basis for categorisation described below is one that leans on the side of caution and should reduce to manageable proportionsthe task of assigning suitable protective measures to particular experiments.We intend it as a guide to assist the initial deliberations of the GMAG andenvisage that, with experience and as the field develops, the GMAG will beable to build up a body of &quot;cast law&quot; against which to judge individualexperiments.* We refer simply to &quot;hazards&quot; throughout the remainder of the report without repealingthe point in paragraph M.
2.2 The techniques of genetic manipulation with which we have been con-cerned usually involve the use of a restriction enzyme to cut a fragment ofnucleic acid from an organism in such a way that the fragment can be recombinedwith a similarly cut fragment of nucleic acid (the &quot;vector&quot;, often a plasmid orbacteriophage) in a different organism. The multiplication of the nucleic acidfragment in the vector occurs by its growth in a host cell, often a bacterium.The hazards involved depend on the following factors:i. the source of the nucleic acid from which the fragment to be linkedis derived;ii. the degree of specification, that is the purity, of the nucleic acidsequence;iii. the vector/host system to be involved in the recombination and inwhich the sequence is to be multiplied; andiv. the manipulative procedures proposed.2.3 In the following paragraphs we refer in general terms to the weight whichshould be given to the four factors referred to in paragraph 2.2. It will be important for the GM AG to obtain quantitative assessments of hazard wherever possible but in our opinion this cannot be done with any precision at this stage and we have not therefore attempted to give figures either for the purity of thenucleic acid sequence needed to meet the criterion of sub-paragraph 2.5.i belowor for the degree of biological containment required in sub-paragraph 2.6.i.In paragraphs 2.4-2.7 we lay most emphasis on the risk to man, since laboratoryworkers will be involved in all experiments; but in particular circumstances thehazard of the nucleic acid for animals or plants may be equally important.2.4   Source of the nucleic acidSources of the nucleic acid are of three main types:i. nucleic acid from bacteria, fungi or protozoa should be categorisedaccording to the known ability of the source microbe to infect or cause disease in man, animals or plants;ii. nucleic acid from viruses should be categorised according to the&quot;hazard classification&quot; of their host or for viruses with a range ofhosts, of the highest class of host indicated in paragraph iii;iii. nucleic acid from higher organisms is generally considered to offer ahazard related to the closeness of the evolutionary relationship between the organism constituting the source of the nucleic acid andthe organism at risk. On this basis we should regard nucleic acidfrom plants and invertebrates as carrying a low hazard to man (wxcept perhaps for invertebrates that may harbour microbes pathogenic forman); nucleic acid from amphibia, reptiles and birds would be assignedan intermediate hazard classification, and nucleic acid from mammals,including man, would be the most hazardous.2.S Specification of die nucleic acid sequencei. The safest nucleic acid fragments are well-characterised sequencesthat do not specify a known hazard. One way of initially purifyingsuch sequences would be by selection and growth in a vector/hostsystem under rigorous containment conditions;
ii. the use of random nucleic acid fractions that may include any com-ponent of the genome introduces greater possible hazards;iii. nucleic acid sequences selected on the basis of their intrinsic patbo-genicity, or of the known toxicity of their products, are still more likely to be dangerous.2.6 The vector/host systemVectors for the recombinant nucleic acid include free DNA, plasmids, bacterio-phages and viruses, and the viable hosts into which the nucleic acid is linkedmay be prokaryotic (bacteria) or eukaryotic (eg animal and plant cells). Thefirst two of the systems listed below employ the principle known as biologicalcontainment:i. the safest system is considered to be a combination of a host bacteriumthat is &quot;disabled&quot; and has been shown by in vivo experiments to havea very small chance of survival in, or of transferring information to,man or animals (or plants as appropriate), with a vector that is specificand confined to that host A less well-attested system, which mightbe as safe, is one differing from the above only in that the &quot;disable-ment&quot; of the bacteria has been demonstrated by in vitro rather thanin vivo experiments;ii. phage or plasmid vectors used in conjunction with, and able to growonly in, attenuated laboratory strains of bacteria also provide a degree of biological containment;iii. those systems in which the vectors are capable of infecting the cellsof higher eukaryotes are considered the most potentially hazardous.2.7 Manipulative proceduresSimple experimental procedures (for example, the inoculation of culture plateswith bacterial colonies) involving small volumes of material offer the smallesthazard. Special methods of manipulating hosts and their vectors with rigorouscontainment may be developed which could further reduce any hazard. Useof an increased volume of material or the introduction of operations such ascentrifiigation, fraction collection or sonic disintegration, with the risk ofaerosol production, clearly increases the hazard.2  Contaiameat measures the hazards have their origin in the nucleic acid but these may be reduced,depending on the vector/host system into which it is to be introduced. when this system is such that the nucleic acid can survive and replicate only in highlyartificial conditions, any hazardous element that might escape could notsurvive. This is the principle of biological containment. Physical containmentmeasures, on the other hand, are designed to ensure that any hazardous elementsthat are created do not escape from the laboratory. We have defined fourlevels of physical containment and associated safety measures in the code of practice referred to in Section 3 below and set out in full in Appendix II andwe propose that an experiment should be assigned to one of these levels on thebasis of the factors in paragraph 2.2 above. Even though genetic materialthought to be completely harmless is being used in an experiment it is con-ceivable that a hazardous product might result because of an unexpectedinteraction and for this reason we recommend that no genetic manipulationexperiment should be undertaken in containment conditions less stringent than
those used for work with common pathogens&apos; corresponding to the conditionsof our level I. The four levels are described in detail in the code of practice(Appendix II) but may be briefly summarised as follows:I. conditions conforming to the standard necessary for the maintenanceof good microbiological practice, as required for work with commonpathogens in a medical microbiology laboratory;II. conditions as at I above in a laboratory which is additionally sitedaway from areas used by the general public and has controlled airflow and an exhaust-protective cabinet for aerosol-producingoperations;III. conditions as at II above but with access to the laboratory only through an airlock containing washing facilities and with an autoclaveand provision for decontamination of all effluent from the laboratory;IV. conditions provided by a laboratory equivalent to the category Atoxic laboratory referred to in Appendix 111 to the Report of theWorking Party on the Laboratory Use of Dangerous Pathogens, iethose at III above with, additionally, provision for a full change of clothing and showering on leaving the laboratory and a double-endedautoclave.2.9  CategorisationThere is a continuous spectrum of hazard but any categorisation must be donein steps. We assume that there are conditions of biological containment andnucleic acid purity that will allow an experiment to be moved from one categoryto another but these cannot be absolutely defined without reference to theindividual experiment. We therefore give some examples to illustrate theprinciples we have adopted in the following table. It will be seen that, expert-ments involving recombination between the nucleic acids of non-pathogenicbacteria are considered to require only category I containment. depending on the degree of biological containment achieved, and on the nature of thenucleic acid sequence inserted, certain other classes of experiment can beacceptably undertaken with Category I or II containment and some examples of such experiments are given in the following table. We stress that the tablegives illustrative examples of some typical experiments and is intended to serveonly as a guide and not as a definition of the whole area of possible work ineach category. It will of course be for the GMAG to advise on specific cases and to establish a more complete categorisation as part of the &quot;case law&quot; asthe work proceeds.* For example, streptococci, staphylococci, salmorwllae and other pathogens commonlypresent in the community and not especially liable to cause laboratory-acquired infection.

It is of course possible to have sequences sckctedbecause of their peuwgenicity and these would mae the level of containment required.

CODE OF PRACTICE3.1 We were asked to draft a central code of practice for laboratories under-taking experiments involving the techniques of genetic manipulation. Wehave done this on the basis of the four levels of physical containment (I-IV)summarised in paragraph 2.8 above; the code of practice is set out in full inAppendix II, together with a table illustrating the major differences betweenthe four containment levels. The following headings are used in the code, asfar as these are applicable to the particular level of containment being described:Laboratory (premises and facilities)Biological Safety OfficerStaff-selectiontrainingsupervisionprotective clothinghealthdisciplinePackaging and transport of samplesSecuritySpecial requirements of experiments involving laboratory animals or plants.3.2 In drawing up the code of practice, we have taken account of the code set out in the Report of the Working Party on the Laboratory Use ofDangerous Pathogens and in view of the similar requirements of our categoryIV containment level and the category A level for dangerous pathogens, wehave tried as far as possible to follow the provisions and wording of thatWorking Party&apos;s code of practice. We also noted that a code of practicecovering three containment levels is being prepared by Sir James Howie&apos;sWorking Party on the Prevention of Infection in Clinical Laboratories.3.3 As indicated in the introduction to the code of practice, we have notattempted to deal with all the technical queries that may arise on various aspectsof the recommended containment levels: we have sought rather to provideguidelines for the GMAG to build on in drawing up the detailed specificationsthat may be necessary for assessment of individual laboratories.
3.4 We recommend that every laboratory conducting genetic manipulationexperiments must have both a properly constituted and representative localsafety committee and a Biological Safety Officer answerable to the adminit-trative head of the establishment or department, who must ensure that theBiological Safety Officer, on whose role we place particular emphasis, has thenecessary training, experience and authority to enable him to carry out his duties. As we explain in Section 5 below, these are factors that we believeshould be taken into account by the. GMAG when it advises on whether ornot a particular experiment should be conducted at a particular laboratory.We discuss training further in Section 4.Experimental Animals3.5 From time to time there will be a need to introduce live bacteria, virusesor phages bearing introduced genetic material into laboratory animals, initiallyto study whether genetic information is indeed transferred to animals inparticular circumstances and to study the distribution, survival and replicationof the vector in the animal. If this is done, the animals used must be kept inappropriate isolation facilities offering at least the level of containment apprc-pnate to the experiment in question and desirably a higher level in view of theincreased risk of dissemination when animals are involved.3.6 Once the results of such experiments are available it may be possible toreduce the strictness of isolation for further experiments of the same type, if for example it has been shown that genetic information is unlikely to be trans-ferred from the vectors. But it will need to be remembered that host-parasiterelationships are rather specific and although there may be no undesirablesequels when a vector is put into one species, the outcome may be differentif a different vector of species of animal is used, or if germ-free animals are usedinstead of conventional animals.Plants3.7 When suitable vectors become available, there will undoubtedly beproposals to introduce foreign nucleic acid into whole plants, especially if someof the exciting possibilities for genetic manipulation referred to in the AshbyReport (paragraph 3.4) are to be explored. Suitable measures of containmentfor the plants will be needed and we include some comments in Section 34of Appendix IL These will vary with the nature of the vector and of the foreignnucleic acid etc, as in paragraphs 2.4-2.7 above.3.8 In view of the availability of experience and expertise m plant pathologyis the Agriculture Departments, and of the rather general nature of the measures required under the present licensing system for known plant pathogens, as summarised in Section 34 of the code of practice, which in any case apply onlyto imported organisms, we feel it would be illogical to attempt to make detailed recommendations for the containment of plants inoculated with vectors ofrecombinant nucleic acid that might involve a hazard to plant populations.We therefore recommend that, for the present, all experiments involving theintroduction of recombinant nucleic acid into plants should require the prior approval of the GMAG and that the GMAG should, at an early stage, agreewith the Agriculture Departments a procedure for specifying suitable con-tainment measures for such experiments proposed to it However, it shouldbe borne in mind that by no means all such experiments will necessarily requiremeasures as strict as those needed for the pathogens at present covered bylicences and it may be possible to reduce the strictness of isolation proceduresas more knowledge of the properties of the new genetic entities becomes available.
4.   TRAINING4.1 The Ashby Report (paragraph 7.3) recommended that all those who work with these techniques should have training in the handling of pathogens. Wewere asked to make recommendations for the provision of necessary training facilities.4.2 The first generation of workers in genetic manipulation will be largelyself-taught, but we consider that appropriate training should be made availableto all research workers, technicians and Biological Safety Officers intending towork in the field and that the head of each establishment or department, advised by the Biological Safety Officer, should ensure that anyone selected for thework has satisfactorily completed an appropriate course of training.4.3  Biological Safety Officers will need:i. to understand both the nature and implications of the genetic experi-ments being undertaken, and also the methods advised for physicalcontainment;ii. to judge the training requirements of the research workers andtechnicians and, as necessary, to recommend appropriate courses, orarrange to supplement a new entranfs experience with in-housetraining;iii. to be familar with health monitoring procedures and to be able to collaborate with the supervisory medical officer in organising them;andiv. to understand the legal and medical provisions relating to work inlaboratories (for example, the Health and Safety at Work Act, relevantcodes of practice and the organisation of local health services) andthe procedures for consulting the Genetic Manipulation AdvisoryGroup (GMAG).Training for Biological Safety Officers will best be provided by special courses,preferably at, or in association with, a laboratory that has the necessary con-tainment facilities and experience of containment techniques.4.4 For research workers and technicians, we see a need for three types oftraining:i. general education in the science of genetic manipulation, in the natureof the potential hazards and of the special precautions required to counter them. This should be required for all research workerswithout relevant experience and would include molecular biology andgenetics, microbiology, epidemiology and relevant aspects of otherdisciplines. Such training might be provided at a university summerschool;ii. as a minimum, practical training in the procedures and manipulationsappropriate to work in a genetic manipulation laboratory at the physical containment level of categories I and II above. This mightbe provided by industrial employers or at special university, pofy-lecrinic or other suitable courses; and. special training for anyone intending to work in a genetic manipulationlaboratory at the physical containment level of categories III or IVabove. Such training should include practice in the use of such facilities and there is therefore a need for specimen physical contain-ment laboratories which can be made available for training as well as for research.
4.5 The demand for training is difficult to judge and flexible arrangements willbe needed. Training facilities will necessarily be found mostly in universities and polytechnics although industrial employers and appropriate Governmentlaboratories will also have a part to play. Universities and polytechnics arealready providing some related courses and, suitably modified, these should be appropriate. The GMAG will need to be aware of the genera) nature of thetraining being provided since this will be relevant in the consideration of advice on individual experiments. They should also maintain a register of training courses and facilities and be prepared to provide information and adviceabout training.5.  CENTRAL ADVICE AND CONTROL5.1 The Ashby Report (paragraph 6.5(d)) suggested that &quot;as an initial step awidely publicised advisory service, perhaps offered by public health laboratories,would help to safeguard the interests of the public and of those engaged in the experiments&quot;. The Government has already accepted that it has a responsi-bility to ensure that authoritative advice and guidance are available to laboratory-lories using the techniques available for genetic manipulation and we were asked to make recommendations for the establishment of a central advisory service.5.2 We were also asked to consider the practical aspects of applying in appro-priate cases the controls advocated by the Working Party on the LaboratoryUse of Dangerous Pathogens, which recommended that initially control shouldbe on the basis of voluntary acceptance by laboratories of the advice of acentrally appointed Dangerous Pathogens Advisory Group (DPAG), but thatvarious existing legal powers which could be invoked to give statutory force tosuch advice should &quot;be consolidated so that the Departments of Health and agriculture can act with full authority, without delay and with uniformprinciples.&quot;&apos;A voluntary system of advice and control5.3 We recommend the establishment of a Genetic Manipulation AdvisoryGroup (GMAG). Since a central advisory service will need to command the respect of the public as well as of the scientific community, including scientistsin industry, the membership of the GMAG should include not only scientistswith knowledge both of the techniques in question and of relevant safetyprecautions and containment measures but also individuals able to take accountof the interests of employees and the general public. We hope that the Govern-ment will agree to the establishment of the GMAG on this basis at an earlydate so that work which is scientifically desirable may proceed quickly andsafely.5.4 The main functions of the GMAG should be to advise on the categoryinto which a particular experiment would fall, taking into account the factorsdiscussed in Section 2 above and on the application to particular cases of the code of practice recommended in Section 3 above. To do this the GMAG will need to maintain records of the facilities available in different laboratories andthe qualifications of Biological Safety Officers: in time it should in effect estab-lish a register of approved laboratories. It should also review experimentalprotocols regularly as part of a continuing assessment of precautions which* Report of the Working Party on the Laboratory Use of Dangerous Pathogens,paragraph 61.
may need to be changed as the subject develops. In particular, the GMAGshould assess any new methods of physical or biological containment that maybe developed by laboratories and consider whether they would justify majormodifications of practice. Such assessment would need to be on the basis notonly of submitted documents but also of independent technical evaluation andvalidation and all interested laboratories should be kept informed of suchdevelopments. A procedure for the acceptance by the GMAG of new methodsof containment and of disabled strains might be introduced. The GMAGshould publish an annual report and be ready to advise on general matters connected with the safety of genetic manipulation, including health monitoring,for which it should be able to call upon the experience of epidemiologists, andthe training of staff.5.S At first sight, there would seem to be a case for assigning to the existingDPAG the functions which we envisage for the GMAG. But those functionsgo considerably beyond the current activities of DPAG and the factors to beconsidered in assessing genetic manipulation experiments are different fromthose where dangerous pathogens are involved. The control of dangerouspathogens involves the application of well-known precautions against a small number of easily identifiable and well characterised agents. With geneticmanipulation on the other hand the hazards and the precautions to be takenwill depend on the detail of the experiment being undertaken. It will thereforebe necessary for the GMAG to scrutinise individual scientific proposals indetail and perhaps to establish a dialogue with the scientists concerned about,for example, particular details of the conditions in the laboratory concerned.It seems to us that the roles and methods of working of the proposed GMAGand of the existing DPAG will be so different that the combination of the tworoles as the responsibility of a single group would reduce the efficiency withwhich both tasks were carried out. We therefore recommend that the GMAGshould be separate from the DPAG but that, because comparable laboratorycontainment measures are key safety features in both fields, there should beliaison between the two groups: in particular, if a proposed genetic manipula-lion experiment involved the use of a dangerous pathogen in the DPAG&apos;sCategory A, then DPAG procedures for control would apply, although theGMAG would clearly need to be involved as well.5.6 We envisage the following stages in the consideration of a proposal foran experiment involving genetic manipulation:i. discussions within the laboratory both of scientific merits and of potential hazards. The laooratory&apos;s Biological Safety Officer and a properly constituted and representative safety committee should havekey roles to play and the discussions should lead to provisional conclusions about the desirability of conducting the experiment and about the containment category into which the experiment should fall;ii. if as a result of these discussions there is no doubt that the proposedexperiment belongs to Category I or II the GMAG should be notifiedimmediately, but work could proceed under the appropriate conditionsas specified in the code of practice;iii. if the discussions suggest that the proposed experiment falls intocategory III or IV, reference must be made to the GMAG for advicebefore a final decision to undertake the experiment is taken;
iv. a proposal referred to the GMAG will be examined for the detail ofthe proposed experimental protocol and of the physical facilities and safety measures at the laboratory concerned. After such considera-tion the GMAG would either:(a) advise that there would be no objection to the work proceeding as proposed; or(b) advise that there would be no objection if specified precautionswere adopted; or(cj advise that the experiment could not be undertaken safely.5.7 It will be important for rapid assessments to be made of category I and IIprotocols which are reported to the GMAG so that any inconsistencies in alocal decision can be quickly corrected. The GMAG will therefore need ascientific secretariat able to react quickly to protocols (consulting a memberof the GMAG as necessary) and to deal directly with a laboratory if it seemsnecessary to question a local decision and to ask for delay pending considerationby the GMAG. Such cases may be rare but the possibility emphasises theneed for speed and flexibility in the procedures for transmitting advice tolaboratories.5.8 The protocols of experiments likely to fall into category III or IV will need more thorough consideration by the GMAG, possibly at a regular meetingof the whole group, taking into account:i. the nature of the experiment, with special reference to the biologicalfactors referred to in Section 2;ii. the facilities at the laboratory concerned. An inspection may benecessary for this purpose in the early stages until a register of approved laboratories (paragraph 5.4 above) is established;iii. the experience, ability and training of the research workers andtechnicians and of the Biological Safety Officer; andiv. the arrangements for monitoring the health of staff.5.9 Formulation of advice on protocols for experiments in category III or IVmay take some time and could in general proceed in parallel with a laboratory&apos;!preparations and planning. But if a voluntary system is to maintain theconfidence and co-operation of the scientists concerned, it is important that thetime taken should be kept to a minimum and should only rarely exceed threemonths.5.10 The efficacy of the advisory machinery recommended above will dependon the willingness of laboratories to accept and act on central advice. Ourconsultations with both academic and industrial scientists convince us thatscientists will in fact welcome and be ready to comply with authoritativeguidance from the centre.Statutory coafrol5.11 On the basis in paragraph 5.10 above, the advisory system we describewould in practice amount to a system of control broadly comparable to that now operating through the OPAG for laboratories working with dangerouspathogens. Some of our witnesses urged that there was a need for specificstatutory powers similar to those advocated by the Working Party on theLaboratory Use of Dangerous Pathogens (paragraph 5.2 above). We carefully considered these views and set out our conclusions below.
5.12 We noted that the Health and Safety at Work Act lays a clear duty on-the employer to protect his employees and also to avoid hazard to the public.We were advised that in the event of legal action a court, in considering whether an employer had taken all reasonably practical steps, would be likely to give-great weight to whether he had sought or taken advice from the GeneticManipulation Advisory Group once it was set up. The Health and SafetyExecutive also has powers of inspection to ensure compliance with requirements for the safety of workers and the public. These existing powers and dutiesarising from the Health and Safety at Work Act already provide a safeguard tothe public. We were advised that as an additional measure, regulations couldbe made under the Act to require laboratories to submit experimental protocolsand appropriate supporting information to the GMAG and we recommendthat this should be done. Given such a requirement, it seems very unlikelythat the advice of the GMAG would be disregarded.5.13 The Health and Safety at Work Act does not however cover hazards tothe plant and animal populations and it seems unlikely that existing powersavailable to the Agriculture Departments could be invoked to provide any necessary statutory controls in this field. In any case, if statutory control isto be envisaged it may be desirable, on the analogy of the recommendations ofthe Working Party on the Laboratory Use of Dangerous Pathogens referred toin paragraph 5.2 above, to envisage some consolidating legislation. Suchspecific legislation might be directed simply towards compulsory consultationwith the GMAG or perhaps extend to a system of licensing for laboratories.A practical difficulty is that a definition of the work to be controlled (forexample, on the lines in paragraph 1.3 above) would almost inevitably becomeoutdated as the science developed and as new techniques emerged. Such a difficulty could be met by a provision that the work subject to control shouldbe specified in regulations which could be amended as necessary more readilythan major legislation.5.14 We recommend that the system of voluntary control we have describedshould be established as quickly as possible since we believe this could provideimmediate and effective control of the hazards while permitting valuable workto proceed safely. The operation of this system will enable the Governmentto consider the desirability and practicability of introducing specific consolidatinglegislation at a later date.Procedure5.15 We have considered whether the GMAG should tender its advice direct to laboratories or to a Government department. We understand that it isintended that laboratories wishing to work with dangerous pathogens will submit their applications to the appropriate Health or Agriculture department and that the Department concerned will reply after consulting the DPAGand other interested departments; but in our view this analogy should not be pressed too far for the reasons we have discussed in paragraph 5.5 above. the role we see for the GMAG will be a scientific advisory one requiring it tomaintain close and continuing contact with the laboratories where the work isbeing done. The GMAG will need to be aware of new developments in the science of genetic manipulation and in health monitoring, training and othersafety related matters and it will need to be able to respond quickly to request from laboratories for advice on these topics. This is rather different from the role of the existing DPAG, which is essentially running a licensing system forlaboratories working with dangerous pathogens.  Because of possible doubts
about what should be within the remit of the GMAG and of the need for speed and flexibility in dealing with a succession of protocols, each of which will need to be reviewed by scientific experts, we consider that it would be best jf theGMAG is an independent advisory body dealing directly with the laboratoriesconcerned. It would certainly be appropriate tor the GMAG to come underthe aegis of a Government department which could for example provide asecretariat and supporting services, and it would be necessary for the GMAGto keep appropriate Government departments informed of the advice givento laboratories.5.16 We would in any case expect Government departments, research councils and other grant-giving bodies to make it a condition of granting funds for genetic manipulation research that institutions and individual investigatorsshould follow the advice of the GMAG and conduct their experiments inaccordance with the procedures recommended. We would also hope that allscientific papers in this field would include a statement of both the physical and biological containment measures involved in the experiments.6.   recommendations we recommend that:i. experiments in genetic manipulation, conducted in appropriateconditions of physical and biological containment, should be encouraged (1.3);ii. further work should be done on the development and characterisationof disabled organisms and that any which are developed should bemade freely available to all workers in the field (1.6);iii. no genetic manipulation experiment should be undertaken in con-tainment conditions less stringent than those used for work withcommon pathogens (2.8);iv. the code of practice in Appendix II should be adopted as a basis forthe conduct of these experiments (3.1);v. every laboratory conducting these experiments should have a safetycommittee and a Biological Safety Officer (3.4);vi. appropriate training should be made available and be required forall research workers, technicians and biological safety officers ingenetic manipulation laboratories (4.2);vii. a Genetic Manipulation Advisory Group (GMAG) should be estab-lished to advise on appropriate precautions for the conduct of theseexperiments (5.3);viii. the GMAG should be separate from the Dangerous PathogensAdvisory Group (DPAG) although there should be liaison betweenthe two groups (5.5);ix. a system of voluntary control should be established as quickly aspossible (5,14);x. regulations should be made under the Health and Safety at WorkAct to require laboratories to submit experimental protocols to theGMAG (5.12);(Numbers in brackets refer to paragraphs in the report)
7.  CONCLUSIONWe tec the system of advice and control we have proposed as providing a framework within which progress can be made in an exciting and important new field of science that offers great potential benefit. Provided that thesystem operates flexibly so that advice to laboratories can be made availablequickly and so that there can be a rapid response to new developments (witha view for example to modification of precautions if necessary), we believe thatscientists will welcome and act on authoritative guidance from the centre. Wethink that it may be necessary for the Government to consider the introductionof specific statutory powers to control generic manipulation but that a decisionon this should be deferred until there is experience of the operation on a voluntary basis of the system which we recommend.

CODE OP PRACTICEINTRODUCTIONThe following code is intended to provide guidelines for the four physicalcontainment levels listed in paragraph 2.8 of the report; they will need to be supplemented by a local code for each laboratory, drawn up in consultationwith the GMAG and taking account of local circumstances.For all four categories, doors to the laboratory must be marked with a&quot;biohazard&quot; or other appropriate sign and a figure (HV) indicating the levelof containment.CATEGORY I CONTAINMENT LABORATORY1.   LABORATORY1.1 The laboratory should not, as far as is practicable, be used for purposeother than the work in question.1.2 The laboratory must have a fume cupboard or negative pressure cabinet with filtered extract to contain aerosol-producing equipment, if such equipment is to be used.1.3 Potentially hazardous waste, eg supernatant from cultures of micro-organisms, cell debris, harvested agar cultures etc, must be rendered safebefore discarding.1.4 The laboratory must contain a hand basin with elbow- or foot-operatedhot and cold water taps.  The basin should be situated near the exit.1.5 Apart from these conditions, the potential hazards arising from work inthis laboratory are controlled by the procedures set out in the applicableparagraphs in the booklet &quot;The Prevention of Laboratory Acquired Infection Public Health Laboratory Service Monograph 6.&quot;The most important of the applicable paragraphs are the following:no smoking, eating or drinking;no mouth pipetting of any liquid;a properly designed laboratory overall;no unaccompanied visitors;all untoward incidents as well as accidents to be recorded;all biological material for transport to other establishments to be packedin accordance with Post Office Regulations.2.  BIOLOGICAL SAFETY OFFICER2.1 A Biological Safety Officer must be appointed who will be answerable tothe head of the establishment or department for enforcing the above conditions.
CATEGORY II CONTAINMENT LABORATORY3.

The basin should be situated near the exit.4.  SELECTION OF STAFF4.1 The head of the establishment or department must ensure that staffselected to fill posts in his laboratory are informed of the potential hazards and consequent precautions applicable to experiments on which they may berequired to work.4.2 A special health declaration form, with the possibility of a medical examination, will be necessary to identify staff who ought not to work in aCategory II laboratory because of prohibitive conditions, particularly those that increase susceptibility to infection.5.  BIOLOGICAL SAFETY OFFICER5.1 A Biological Safety Officer must be appointed; ideally, he should havehad experience in working within such a laboratory or with similar forms ofprotective techniques, but this condition should not exclude an individual whois otherwise well suited for the position, eg who has a sense of responsibility,strength of character and the necessary authority. He should be suitablytrained and provided with technical assistance as necessary. Appropriatedeputising arrangements must be made.5.2 The Biological Safety Officer will act as adviser to the head of theestablishment or department in all matters relating to the containment ofbiological hazards and the safety of staff.6.  TRAINING6.1 Before allowing a new entrant to work in a Category II laboratory, theBiological Safety Officer must be satisfied that the individual concerned under-stands the regulations and can safely use all equipment within the laboratory.Ideally, the new entrant should have recognised training in medical micro-biological techniques but in-house training will suffice.
7.   SUPERVISION7.1 The Biological Safety Officer must have a&apos; list of all employees working inthe laboratory.7.2 A senior member of the laboratory staff should supervise the work of anew entrant and in any case a senior member of staff who is responsible for aparticular experiment must be responsible for all staff working on thisexperiment.7.3 No one may enter the laboratory for cleaning, servicing of equipment,repairs or other activities unless a senior member of the staff has been informed and laboratory surfaces have been disinfected in accordance with paragraph10.1 (vii) below.7.4 The senior member of staff responsible for an experiment will bepersonally answerable to the Biological Safety Officer for the safe executionof the work in progress at any time and for the day-to-day cleanliness ofthe laboratory.8.

DISCIPLINE10.1 The Biological Safety Officer will be answerable to the head of theestablishment or department for:i. enforcing the code of practice;ii. all aspects of training;
ui. investigating all accidents, spillages etc in the laboratory and takingwhat action he considers necessary. Each incident and the action taken must be recorded, together with toe names of the personnelinvolved;iv. the safe storage of pathogenic or potentially pathogenic material andthe maintenance of an inventory of these materials;v. the transport of pathogenic or potentially pathogenic material to anysite outside the Category II laboratory. Each transfer must be recorded;vi. liaison with the supervisory Medical Officer, family practitioners of employees working in the laboratory, and community physicians;vii. ensuring that laboratory surfaces are disinfected prior to the start -of new experiments involving a different agent (vector, host,,- etc) orthe entry of maintenance personnel;viii. the security of the laboratory.CATEGORY IH CONTAINMENT LABORATORY11.  LABORATORY11.1 The laboratory must not open on to a busy corridor or a corridor that is used by members of the public; if passible it should be sited in a no thoroughfarearea such as the dead end of a corridor. The laboratory must not be sitednext to a known fire hazard (eg the solvent store) or be in danger of flooding.11.2 Entry to the laboratory must be through an airlock which is divided,eg by an 18* high removable partition, into a clean and restricted side. the restricted side must have sufficient space for handwashing and for removingand discarding protective clothing, shoes and gloves.11.3 The laboratory and airlock must be ventilated by a plenum and exhaustair system; the exhausted air must, before it leaves the laboratory, be filteredthrough a HEPA filter. To protect the extract filter, the input air should befiltered to remove coarse particles. At all times, the airflow must be from the outside area into the laboratory; this fa ordinarily achieved by a negativepressure of at least 7.00 mm of water, this reading to be displayed on a rnano-meter which can be read from both inside and outside the laboratory.11.4 There should be a double-ended autoclave going from the laboratorythrough a wall to a clean area; a connecting autoclaving room dedicated tolaboratory use; a double-ended dunk-task for the removal of material to anautoclaving facility; or a safe- variation of any of these provisions.11.5 The laboratory must be scalable to permit fumigation.11.6 The laboratory must be animal and insect proof.11.7 All effluent, including that from handwashing in the airlock, must be rendered safe before leaving the laboratory.11.8 There must be adequate space in the laboratory; a guideline of 24 m3.including essential equipment, is recommended for each worker.
11.9 There must be an exhaust-protective cabinet for containing aerosol-producing equipment; it should have a facility for glove ports.

Where rotation throughdepartments is practised, this should be so organised that staff have sufficient time to accustom themselves to local conditions.14.  TRAINING14.1 Before allowing a new entrant to work in a Category III laboratory, theBiological Safety Officer must be satisfied that the individual concerned under-stands the regulations and can safely use all necessary equipment within thelaboratory. Ideally, the new entrant should have recognised training in medical microbiological techniques but in-house training or appropriateexperience over a period of time in a Category II laboratory will suffice.15.  SUPERVISION15.1 No one may work in the laboratory unless they have received writtenauthority from the Biological Safety Officer; before granting authority theBiological Safety Officer must have knowledge of each individuals duties.
15.2 Notwithstanding the above conditions, a senior member of the laboratorystaff must supervise the work of the new entrant and in any case the seniormember of staff who is responsible for a particular experiment must beresponsible for all staff working on this experiment.15.3 No one may enter the laboratory for cleaning, servicing of equipment,repairs or other activities, unless written authority has been given by theBiological Safety Officer and the laboratory has been disinfected in accordancewith paragraph 18.1 (vii) below. Equipment must not be removed from thelaboratory without further written authority.15.4 The senior member of staff responsible for an experiment will bepersonally answerable to the Biological Safety Officer for the safe executionof the work in progress at any time and for the day-to-day cleanliness of thelaboratory.15.5 At all times when someone is working in the laboratory, there must bea second competent person able to assist in case of emergency.16.   PROTECTIVE CLOTHING16.1 In the containment area, an authorised overall, gloves and overshoesmust be worn; when aerosol-producing equipment is used, a face shield must also be worn.16.2 Protective clothing must not be worn outside the laboratory; it must beautoclaved or disinfected before being removed from the containment area.17.

CATEGORY IV LABORATORY (Total containment)21.   LABORATORY21.1 The laboratory must form an isolated part of the establishment ordepartment in order to remove the possibility of laboratory workers or thegeneral public passing by en route to another area. The laboratory must notbe sited next to a known fire hazard (eg the solvent store) or be in danger offlooding.21.2 Entry to the laboratory must be through an airlock. The clean side ofthe airlock must be separated from the restricted side by changing and showeringfacilities. There must be provision for a double-ended autoclave with entry inthe restricted area and exit in a clean area outside the laboratory.21.3 The laboratory and airlock must be ventilated by a plenum and exhaustair system; and the exhausted air must, before it leaves the laboratory, befiltered through a HEPA filter. To protect the extract filter, the input air should be filtered to remove coarse particles. At all times, the airflow mustbe from the outside area into the laboratory; this is ordinarily achieved by a negative pressure of at least 7.0 mm of water, this reading to be displayed on amanometer which can be read from both inside and outside the laboratory.21.4 The laboratory must be scalable to permit fumigation.21.5  The laboratory must be animal and insect proof.21.6 All effluent, including that from the shower, must be rendered safe before leaving the laboratory.21.7 There must be adequate space in the laboratory; a guideline of 24 m3including essential equipment, is recommended for each worker.21.8 The Biological Safety Officer must agree adequate fire precautions with local fire officers.21.9 Provision must be made for a gas-tight glove box with HEPA filteredextract and for a second cabinet (through which room air is extracted to aHEPA filter) for containing aerosol-producing equipment, unless this can beused in the gas-tight glove box.21.10 ALL material must be rendered safe before removal from the laboratory:there must be a double-ended &quot;dunk-tank&quot; to allow the removal through asuitable disinfectant of material which cannot be autoclaved, eg samples for transport to other laboratories. Removal of material in this way should beas rare an occurrence as possible and must be carried out only with the authorisation-tion of the Biological Safety Officer and under defined conditions.22.  BIOLOGICAL SAFETY OFFICER22.1 A Biological Safety Officer must be appointed; ideally he should havehad experience of working within such a laboratory or with similar forms ofprotective techniques but this condition should not exclude an individual whois otherwise well suited for the position, eg who has a sense of responsibility,strength of character and the necessary authority.

PACKAGING AND TRANSPORT OF SAMPLES29.1 Containers with liquid samples must be sealed in a metal containeridentified with a biohazard label and filled with sufficient absorbent materialwholly to mop up a spill; a label inside the metal container must provide information on the sample.29.2 Solid samples must be placed in a glass or plastic container securelypacked within a metal container so that in the event of the latter being ruptured,it will be apparent whether the material could have escaped; a label inside the metal container must provide information concerning the sample.30.   SECURITY30.1   The laboratory must be secure against the entry of intruders or vandals.30.2 Security patrols must not enter the laboratory. If it appears that anadjacent fire or water hazard threatens the room, the Biological Safety Officermust be informed.30.3 A key to the laboratory must be held centrally for emergency access but should only be released on the instruction of the Biological Safety Officer (eg ifhe knows that the room is clean then he can do this by telephone).EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALSAccommodation should in the main conform with the principles set out forthe equivalent categories of physical containment described above.31.  CATEGORY II31.1 Animals must be kept in a negative pressure isolation room in theanimal house.31.2 One member of the animal house staff with an authorised back-upsystem must be responsible for the care of animals.31.3  Inoculation and handling of animals must be carried out by two people.31.4 All refuse and carcases must be securely bagged before being removed from the room and then incinerated or autoclaved.
32.  CATEGORY III32.1 Animals must be kept in a Category III laboratory in an exhaust-protective cabinet or isolation facilities that meet the same type of requirement.All refuse and carcases must be autoclaved and then incinerated.32.2  Inoculation and handling of animals must be carried out by two people.32.3  Live animals must not be removed from the laboratory.32.4 Animal tissue may be removed from the laboratory only with theauthority of the Biological Safety Officer and under defined conditions.33.   CATEGORY IV33.1 Animals must be kept in a Category IV laboratory in an exhaust-protective cabinet or isolation facilities that meet the same type of requirement.All refuse and carcases must be autoclaved and then incinerated.33.2  Inoculation and handling of animals must be carried out by two people33.3  Live animals must not be removed from the laboratory.33.4 Animal tissue may be removed from the laboratory only with theauthority of the Biological Safety Officer and under defined conditions.PLANT EXPERIMENTS34.  CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES34.1 Suitable containment procedures will be required for plants into whichrecombinant DNA (and perhaps eventually RNA) is introduced in viral,bacterial or fungal vectors. Owing to the need for special conditions ofillumination, humidity, temperature, etc, for satisfactory growth of higherplants, it is not appropriate to specify that the plants should be kept in alaboratory of one of the types described in this code of practice. Instead,suitable glasshouses or controlled environment cabinets will be needed.34.2 It is unlikely that extraordinary containment measures will be requiredfor any experiments; measures similar to the quarantine procedures specifiedin licences for the retention of imported plantjpathogens issued to laboratoriesby MAFF or DAFS would be adequate. The conditions specified in suchlicences vary with the class of pathogen (virus, bacterium or fungus), itsvirulence and its means of dissemination. Requirements for insect-proofingand fumigation, for the avoidance of root or leaf contact with other plants, etc,may be included in licences. There are also standard provisions for destructionof unwanted cultures or plant parts by heat or disinfection and for the pro-hibition of unauthorised distribution of cultures. The choice of appropriatecontainment measures is normally left to the licensee, who typically agrees lo&quot;take whatever precautions as are necessary to ensure that the organisms donot escape&quot;, or words to this effect, but advice is available from the appropriatebranch of MAFF or DAFS, whose officers have the right to inspect premiseswhere the organisms are kept.34.3 All experiments involving the introduction of recombinant DNA intoplants should require the prior approval of the GMAG (see paragraph 3.8of the report).
