THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government cp(76) 52 COPY NO13 July 1976CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND THE PUBLIC SECTORBORROWING REQUIREMENT 1977-78Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. At our meeting on 6 July (CM(76) 13th Conclusions) we were ingeneral agreement that we must act now to reduce the public sectorborrowing requirement (PSBR) in 1977-78.    But the decisions have still tobe taken.   I hare already explained in CP(76) 42 how the need to reduce thePSBR rests on arguments concerning the difficulty of financing It and the pressure on resources.   There is, however, a more immediate andcompelling danger.THE IMMEDIATE DANGER2.        The $5. 3 billion standby credit which we secured at toe beginning ofJune has barely given us a breathing space.   X have had to draw asubstantial amount from this standby in order to create the market conditions in which we can take the necessary decisions in an orderly way.There was one period, well after the initial uncertainties following theannouncement of the standby, in which the pressure on sterling could have carried the rate down to a disastrous level if we had not intervened tosupport it.   The rate has been steadier in the last fortnight, partly because we have shown we are prepared to intervene if necessary butmainly because of the belief that we shall be announcing important policy decisions concerning public expenditure and the PSBR for 1977-78 by theend of this month.   If such an announcement ie not made or is found to be inadequate, then sterling will again come under pressure on a scale whichwe cannot be confident of resisting even if we use all our present reaoaraes,3.        The soundings I have made in the last week have revealed a powerful feeling on both the Left and the Right of the Party, that if we haveto do something unpleasant this summer it must at least be sufficient to dothe job and to spare us a repetition next summer.   I believe that many whodeeply regret the need for expenditure cuts will be prepared to bite on thebullet providing they are satisfied that we shall not be coming back for more in a few months - or even weeks- time.
4.        Our objective must be a package which will re-establish confidence in our economic policies to a degree which enables us to rebuild our reserves and avoid being forced to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to repay our drawings on the $5. 3 billion standby.    If we do not achieve this objective and we are driven to use the IMF facilities largely to repay ourdrawings on the standby, we should not have them available to finance the external deficit we must continue to expect in 297? and 1978,   So we should run the risk of another sterling crisis in those years.    Moreover, a situation in which we were compelled to go to the IMF because we had failedto satisfy the market about our credit-worthiness would,  by definition, be one in which the IMF would require us to make further policy changesbeyond those that would be announced this month.   And we would probably have to negotiate about these policy changes in the autumn before the newpay policy had had a chance to establish itself in the first major settlementsof the pay round.THE SCALE OF ACTION REQUIRED5.        In my judgment the minimum required to give us a chance of re-establishing confidence would be a clear commitment to get the PSBRdown to a figure in the region of  9 billion in 1977-78 fcr 6  per cent of gross Domestic Product (GDP)) as against  ll^ billion (or about 9i per *entof GDP) in the current year.    This implies a reduction of about tl\ billioncompared with the figure of  lo  billion for the PSBR in 1977*78 in thecurrent National Income Forecast; I must stress that the figure of 10^ billion is on the assumption of no tax changes in the next Budget totake account of inflation over the previous year.   In other words thisstarting point already assumes a rising burden of taxation next year,6,        I believe we cannot achieve a cut in the PSBR of this size next yearwithout  wrecking either our pay policy or our industrial policies unlessthe bulk of the cut comes from reductions in public expenditure amountingto at least  1 billion at 1976 Survey prices.   That would represent areduction in the PSBR in 1977-78 of 1700-1900 million, depending on the composition of the package.THE TAX ELEMENT7.        It will be seen that expenditure cuts of this magnitude might stillrequire at least  600 million of the reduction In the PSBR to be found fromtax increases in the next Budget beyond the expected yield from fiscal drag,unless by then the outlook for the PSBR makes this unnecessary.    On theother hand, the PSBR for 1977-76 might as easily look worse next April; aZ per cent margin of error in the forecast of either expenditure or revenuecan change the PSBR by  500 million.
8*        The precise scale and content of a possible tax package is somethingon which it is neither necessary nor desirable to take decisions until muchnearer ths 1977 Budget,   But I remain convinced that we should keep any increase in taxation to the minimum,.   Real take-home pay has now fallen by 5 per cent since the first quarter of 1975.    Current forecasts suggestthat it will have to fall significantly further by the first quarter of 1978*   Atworst the real take-home pay of the average person at work could by then beback to its level of seven years previously, in 1971.    But this average figure conceals the fact that while juveniles and women will have donebetter, men, in particular family men, will have done worse,9.        The magnitude of this fall in real take-home pay reflects the delay in reaching our inflation targets, due mainly to faster depredation and theincrease In commodity prices.    This slowing down of progress oninflation will add to the problems of external confidence and to our difficulties in borrowing both for the balance of payments deficit and for the fiscal deficit at home.    To add substantially to the price level by increasingindirect taxes now or in April 1977 could end progress on inflationaltogether.   To cut real take-home pay further by Increases in Income taxcould break the 4f per cent pay policy and remove all hope of moderation in     jpay increases after July 1977.   To cut the PSBR in 1977-78 byf 1, 000 million through increases in either direct or indirect taxation would cut living standards by a further Z\ per cent on top of the fall already in prospect.   The foreigners on whose confidence we rely for financing our external deficit and for maintaining the stability of sterling are well aware of the implications of this for pay policy and inflation.iTHE PSBR TARGET j10,       Nevertheless, a cut of  1, 000 million In public expenditure wouldnot by Itself be sufficient to satisfy foreign opinion that we were makingefforts to reduce our public sector deficit during the upturn In any waycomparable with those already undertaken by France, Germany and theUnited States, none of which have our external problems.    That is why Ibelieve we must commit ourselves simultaneously to a PSBR target for1977-78 which we would express as &quot;of the order of  9 billion&quot;.   We would,of course, emphasise that this represented a considerable reduction belowthis year&apos;s expected PSBR of  11; billion, both In terms of money and as a percentage of G P (from 9$ per cent down to 6  per cent).    Our commit-ment to this target should not be entirely rigid; we should make it dependon the re-expansion of the economy proceeding In the way we now foresee.But such a commitment would have no credibility without the decision on public expenditure cuts of at least  1 billion now.11.       My judgment is that a reduction of  1 billion in public expenditurein 1977-78 is the minimum required to prevent a further slide of confidencewhich would compel us to take emergency measures far more damaging to
employment, living standards and recovery than what is now proposed,must therefore seek my colleagues&apos; support in securing reductions of t)amount, aa the major contribution of fiscal policy towards reducing thePSBR to about  9 billion in 1977-78,D W treasury Chambers13 July 1976
