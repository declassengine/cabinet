DOCUMENT TS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(76) 74 onCOPY NO      u J6 September 1976CABINETPROPOSED MERGER BETWEEN TATE &amp; LYLE ANDMANBRE &amp; GARTONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Prices and consumer Protection and Paymaster general.        I seek my colleagues agreement that I should refer the proposedmerger between Tate &amp; Lyle (Tate) and Manbre &amp; Garton (Manbre) to the monopolies and Mergers Commission, for investigation of those aspectsnot concerned with cane sugar.THE COMPANIES2.        Details of Tate and of Manbre are at Annex A.    The two companiesshare the United Kingdom cane sugar market, roughly in the proportions77 per cent;23 per cent.    They agree on the need to reduce refining capacityby one-third (from 1, 9 million to 1.3 million tons) by 1980, and put jointlyto Government last January alternative proposals to achieve this.    They also discussed - inconclusively - ways of establishing the necessary unifiedcontrol of the refineries, by one or possibly two joint companies.    Tate have since entered the starch and glucose market (from which Manbre derir*70 per cent of their profits) by buying a one-third interest, with an american and a Belgian partner, in Tunnel Refineries Ltd and a sister company in belgium,THE PROPOSED MERGER3.        On 28 July Tate made an offer worth  40 million to Manbre share-holders.    If this succeeds, Tate would have statutory monopolies in each ofthe United Kingdom markets for cane sugar, starch, glucose and sweetnersgenerally of 50 per cent ox more (the legislation defines &quot;monopoly&quot; as25 per cent of a market sector).4.        The proposed merger is opposed not only by Manbre, who vigorouslydeny Tate&apos;s claim that it is the only available route to rationalisation of canesugar refining, but by the whole food and drink industries and by importantretailers and supermarket chains.    Union branches at Manbre is Greenockand Newron-le-Willows refineries have also publicly expressed opposition,1
5. Acceptances received by 1 September, when Tate&apos;s offer firstexpired, totalled only 3j per cent of Manbre shares.    The offer has been extended to 10 September.THE CASE FOR A REFERENCE6.        Before Tate announced their offer, they had been advised in confidence (with Ministers&apos; agreement) that it was not my intention to refer the sugar aspects of a merger with Manbre to the Monopolies and MergersCommission, but that it was not possible to give them a confidential view on whether or not I might refer its non-sugar aspects.    Despite the representa-tions now received against the merger from customers for sugar, I acceptthe need for rationalisation of the cane sug .r industry and am therefore prepared to limit the scope of an investigation by the Commission to thenon-sugar side.    But there is in my view an overwhelming case for such an investigation (which could be completed by Christmas), on the following grounds ;-a. I have to decide whether a merger raises question of sufficient importance to justify a full and independent investigation.It cannot be denied that this one does.    But it is for theCommission, not for me, to recommend where the public interestlies.b. The Director General of Fair Trading has stronglyrecommended a reference, and the merger is so contentious,so large, and so important to a large slice of the food and drinkindustries that in the ordinary way there would be no question ofmy not accepting his advice.c. Takeover activity is rising fast (a threefold increase sinceend-1975), as a cheap and quick way of acquiring assets.    Alreadysome 40 offers for public companies, worth.  300 million, are said to be open.    Non-reference of Tate&apos;s highly controversial bidwould be soen in the City as the green light for another mergersboom, perhaps of 1972 proportions.    Our Union supporters willnot welcome the prospect of the redundancies this is likely tobring about.d. United Kingdom industry is already highly concentrated;if we are to succeed in raising the level of its performance, wecannot afford further increases in monopoly power, with the riskof misallocated resources, higher costs and lack of technicalinnovation.    There is no substitute for competition in improvinga company&apos;s efficiency.a.      Manbre is regarded by its customers as an innovative and efficient supplier, giving good service.    By contrast, there hasbeen an unprecedented volume of protests At Tate&apos;fi attitude (see annex B) and of fears about the consequences if they take overManbre.2
ARGUMENTS AGAINST A REFEP*ENCE7.        My colleagues who are against a reference contend that it wouldimpede the rationalisation scheme and thereby put at risk the creation by&apos;iate of new job opportunities at Liverpool.    They suggest that assurancesTate have offered about their future behaviour should suffice to meetcriticism of the merger.8. X cannot accept these arguments.    If unified control of the refineriesis necessary to effect rationalisation, I cannot believe that the Ministry ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food (on v.!.ose efforts in Brussels bothcompanies depend) do not have enough leverage to bring them together in one or more joint companies for iaXa purpose.    It ia suggested that Tatewill only invest in new chemical plant at Liverpool (intended, with twominor projects, to absorb all but 300 of the sugar workers made redundantthere) if they obtain Manbre&apos;s profitable starch business on favourable terms.    This too is specious;  Tate say that the issue of starch and glucoseonly arises because of failure to agree about sugar.    They are alreadystarting to instal the chemical plant, and if they expect a good profit fromthis they will doubtless go ahead anyway.    At best, Tate&apos;s proposedsolution of the Merseyside employment problem would save less than400 jobs within the assisted area - at a cost of losing 480 at Newton-le-WILtowsonly a mile or so outside the area.    Manbre claim that, if both companiesmake sacrifices and show proper concern for their own workers, all sixrefineries can remain centXGB of employment (the Unions&apos; objective) with nocompulsory redundancies.    Natural justice demands that this claim be properly heard; but both Manbre and the Transport and General Workers!Union (who oppose the merger) say that they have had no discussions on itwilfc the Government.9.        Assurances by Tate about future behaviour would not be accepted bytheir critics as a substitute for the stimulus of competition, and would thus be of little value - even presentationally - in defending non-reference.    Asin the Ford and Rootes/Chrysler cases, it would be a potential source of embarrassment to Her Majesty&apos;s Government to have to renegotiateassurances that concerned matters that needed to change over time (Likemaintenance of an existing range of products).    The most important aspects of Tate&apos;s future behaviour - their vvillingness to innovate and respond to customers1 needs - are intangible, and not the sort of thing a company can make promises about.    In any case, assurances could not be enforced underthe legislation without a prior report from the Commission; only thus, ifTate acquired Manbre, could all the potential abuses be brought to light.3
CONCLUSION10.       In my view, a reference of the non-sugar aspects of the proposedmerger is necessary if we are to maintain a credible mergers policy,and need not impede either rationalisation of sugar refining or the provisionof alternative jobs.    Assurances by Tate are no substitute for a full and independent investigation of the effect of the merger on the public interest.S w department of Prices and Consumer Protection6 September 19764
ANNEX ADETAILS OF TATE AND LYLE limited and MANBRE AND GARTON LIMITEDTate and LyleTate has total assets of  400m; a turnover in the year to 30thSeptember 1975 of  1,274m, yielding pre-tax profits of  47,5m;and 9,520 employees in the UK.   Their activities embracecane sugar refining, international commodity trading, bulkliquid storage and various other activities; but their sugarrefining and other sugar interests are likely to   amount towell over half their total turnover.Manbre and GartonManbre has total assets of  73.1m; a turnover of  143.4m.,yielding pre-tax profits of  7.1m; and 2,154 employees in the uk.   Apart from refining, Manbre&apos;s main activity is the millingof maize to produce starch, glucose and similar products.Location and capacity of the two companies&apos; existing sugar refineriesLocationCapacity(m tonnes)EmployeesTateThames (Silvertown)LiverpoolWalker (Greenock)0.90.550.112,6401,920380T3SManbreSankey (Newton-le-Willovs)HammersmithWestburn (Greenock)0.160.130.124803804200.411,2801
The two companies put forward to MAFF in January 1976 variousoptions for reducing capacity by 0.6m tonnes by 1980.   Afurther option worked out by MAFF officials was discussed byEl Committee in May 1976.   It would operate in two stages:(a)     reduce capacity at Liverpool (by half), and close sugar production at Hammersmith; and later(b)     close Sankey.This is the option on which Tate*s plans following the mergerare believed to be based.

*We are a considerable user of sugar and other sweeteners supplie dby both Tate and Manbre and have a first hand knowledge of theoperations of both companies.   Tate are certainly inflexible,impersonal and dictatorial in their trading relationships withour companies by comparison with the smaller and more flexibleManbre.1&quot;Over the years we have done a great deal of business with bothTate and Manbre.   On the whole Tate have proved to be amonopolistic and arrogant supplier.1
