COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL AID TO POLITICAL PARTIESAn independent committee was appointed in May 1975 to consider whetherprovision should be made from public funds to assist political parties in carryingout their functions outside Parliament.The members of the Committee were:The Rt Hon Lord Houghton of Sowerby, CHI Aitken EsqSir Tatton BrintonSir Edmund ComptonProfessor M P FogartyLord Greene of Harrow WealdJ Haviland EsqProfessor D N MacCormickLord McCarthyMrs M H ThomasH R UnderhiU Esq, CBELord Wall, OBEThe Secretariat was provided by the Cabinet Office.
The Rt Hon Michael Foot, mp lord President of the CouncilPrivy Council Office68 WhitehallLondon SW1On 8 May 1975 you informed the House of Commons that a committee hadbeen established to consider the question of financial aid to political parties.The terms of reference were:&quot;To consider whether, in the interests of Parliamentary democracy,provision should be made from public funds to assist political parties incarrying out their functions outside Parliament; to examine the practiceof other Parliamentary democracies in this field, and to make recommenda-tions as to the scope of political activities to which any such provision shouldrelate and the method of its allocation.&quot;We now have the honour to submit our Report.Four of our members (Mr Ian Aitken, Sir Tatton Brinton, Mr Julian Havilandand Professor MacCormick) do not consider that the case has been made out for the introduction of state financial aid to the political parties at this time.Accordingly, whilst agreeing that Chapters 1 to 8 inclusive of the Reportrepresent a fair account of the facts and evidence given to the Committee, andaccepting with the rest of the Committee that the schemes proposed in Chapter 10would provide the best and fairest means of administering a system of financial aid to the political parties, they do not support their introduction in presentdrcurnstances. Their dissenting view is expressed in the Minority Report.Sir Edmund Compton, whilst associating himself with the majority of theCommittee, has submitted a note of reservation on one aspect of the Report.HOUGRTON OF sowerby (Chairman)I AITKENTATTON BRINTONEDMUND COMPTONM P FOGARTYGREENE of harrow wealdj havilandD N MacCORMICKMcCarthym h thomash r underhillwall

FOREWORD BY THE CHAIRMANThis Report breaks new ground in the perennial debate about the boundaries of state action in our modern society.We cover a field of public and political activity in which traditionally the state has hitherto played no part. Although political parties have long been essentialto the working of our parliamentary system, their management, organisationand effectiveness usually arouse no great public interest. Political party financesdo however make fairly frequent news, especially when appeals are launchedfor more money. It is safe to say that this Report will shed more light on the domestic affairs of our political parties, and on pubhc reactions to them, than has been possible before.The idea of state aid to political parties in this country extends discussions wehave already had about the pay and facilities for Members of Parliament,grants to opposition parties at Westminster, and the broadcasting of proceedings in Parliament. The desirability of actually underwriting politics by the state has never been seriously considered by Parliament in this country. The effects of inflation and rising costs upon party finances have now raised the question ofstate grants as a desirable, and possibly the only, way of supporting theminimum standards of political activity and efficiency required to maintainthe vitality of our system of representative government.That is where this Cornmittee came in fourteen months ago.We have received the views of many organisations, companies, trade unions,political parties and persons of wisdom and standing in public life. Some ofthem clearly had not previously believed this to be a matter requiring theirdeep consideration. It soon became apparent however that there existed sharpdivisions of opinion, almost of doctrine, on the principles of state intervention in party politics at all.It is not surprising that the critics of state aid found some response on theCommittee itself. Regrettably we cannot present a unanimous Report. four members are unable to go along with the general tenor of the Report of themajority of the Committee. As will be seen however there is a good deal ofagreement upon the growing importance of political parties and the additionalresponsibilities which direct elections to a European Parliament and elected assemblies in Scotland and Wales will impose upon them. The difficulty onthe Committee has been to express hopes and to sound warnings in words which twelve members can individually and collectively endorse, even thoughthe judgement behind them may rest largely upon common ground. For that reason, both groups of opinion on the Committee have thought it best to put their respective points of view separately.Our Report is made in a period of keen political and economic debate aboutthe level of public expenditure. Indeed it is the prevailing economic conditionswhich precipitated our appointment in the first place. Otherwise there wouldhave been much less urgency and less of a problem to consider. It is not part
of the work of our Committee to join in the controversy about cuts in public expenditure or to comment upon pronouncements made by Ministers andothers, or even to refer to them. Still less is it appropriate for us to relate theneeds of our party political and parliamentary institutions to other chumsupon public funds.That is not our business. While it is proper for us to have full regard to present economic conditions, and this we do, it would be quite wrong for us to assume the role of arbiter on public expenditure. Weightier opinion than our ownmust decide where the interests of our parliamentary democracy comes on the list of priorities.Our business is to sdck to our terms of reference and judge the matter to thebest of our ability after long and searching study and discussion. This we havedone in a spirit of harmonious understanding of the issues involved and their importance to the future of Parliament. The majority and minority on theCommittee have come to different conclusions on the wider questions of thedesirability and the need for state action though the Committee is agreed uponthe rejection of a number of ideas which have been put to us. By this processof elimination of some proposals the Committee has come more closely together on the sort of schemes which would be the most suitable for our political and parliamentary system if practical action is decided upon.There are a few cardinal points to make absolutely clear.One is that no candidate and no party need feel obliged to claim the financial aid we propose. It would be entirely optional.Equally plainly&apos; it should be stated that contracting out by any candidatesor parties should in no way prejudice-still less veto the claims of others.Our proposals are not so much a means test as an efficiency rating. Thepossibility that some candidates or parties may decide to do without stateaid and to rely on existing or alternative sources of finance must not be allowedto weaken the position of candidates or parties who are not so well placed.The next question of vital importance is the position of candidates and partieswhose policies and activities may be abhorrent to many people. The argumentis that to give state aid to parties and candidates we may loath would be anaffront to those who find extreme policies repugnant. Some would go further and declare that these extremists are a danger to social and industrial peace and a threat to Parliament.This is a political and not a constitutional argument So long as no political party is banned in Britain all are equal before the law. No political party hasto take an oath of allegiance and all candidates for election, irrespective oftheir views, however extreme or crackpot, qualify for all the state-aidedfacilities already given to all other candidates at election times. There is no discrimination. Any group of opinion or of the community is free to seek bylawful and peaceful means what support it can get for whatever political aimsit may have.
Under our proposals the sole test of the credentials of any candidate or any party is one of substantial electoral support through the ballot box. Only by putting up candidates for election can anybody or any party come within our proposals. The willingness of all concerned to work through the electoraland parliamentary system is the absolute test. The &quot;threshold&quot; conditionsare not designed to keep any party out but to lay down the conditions of electoral support which a party must satisfy before they can be brought in.We have not invented this &quot;threshold&quot; formula. It is already being applied in two of its three conditions in connection with state aid to opposition parties in Parliament. We have added a third qualifying condition (that of a partyhaving to gain the electoral support necessary to save their candidates&apos; depositsin at least six constituencies in a general election) in order to meet the case of a party which has considerable electoral support spread over a wide area but which fails to win a seat in Parliament.I must deal with the criticism that state aid means compelling taxpayers tocontribute to causes they abhor. The long answer is given in our Report:the short answer is that all of us have to put up with that already.I emphasise the need for early decisions to be taken on our Report. It will beharmful if the parties are kept waiting very long about their financial future.I express warm thanks to my colleagues on the Committee, secretariat and staff, who have devoted themselves to what many candid friends have described as a thankless task. We have been happy in our work and in the discussion,argument, disagreement and the co-operation and good humour of it all.I conclude by quoting some words written by Mr George Hutchinson inThe Times newspaper on 27 December 1975 (under the title, aptly enough,&quot;The voices of leadership that should be heard&quot;).&quot;The ordinary person does not aspire to lead or govern his country. In ademocracy he elects others to do so, reposing hope and confidence not onlyin their goodwill, as expressed in their acceptance of a larger public respon-sibility, but in their capacity as well their actual ability to do what is expected of them or at least to attempt it.Although in practice the precept falls short of perfection, it is a good one.Instead of knocking our parliamentary system and institutions, we shouldtake pride in them for all their faults.&quot;Our Report goes on from there.HOUGHTON OF SOWERBY
SUMMARY OF recommendations we recommend the introduction of a system of state financial aid for political parties in the United Kingdom.Such aid should take the form of:(i) annual grants to be paid from Exchequer funds to the central organisa-tions of the parties for their general purposes, the amounts being determined according to the extent of each party&apos;s electoral support;(ii) at local level, a limited reimbursement of the election expenses ofParliamentary and local government candidates.In order to qualify for a grant a party must at the previous general electionhave either:(a) saved the deposits of its candidates in at least six constituencies; or(b) had at least two of its candidates returned as Members; or(c) had one of its candidates returned as a Member, and received as a party a total of not less than 150,000 votes.The amount of the annual grant payable to each of the qualifying parties shallbe calculated on the basis of 5p for each vote cast for its candidates at the previousgeneral election.The scheme for the limited reimbursement of candidates&apos; election expensesshould apply to all Parliamentary elections, and to all elections for county and district councils in England and Wales, regional, island and district councils in Scotland, and the Greater London Council and London borough councils.Reimbursement should be restricted to those candidates who poll at least one-eighth of the votes cast, and the amount to be reimbursed should be the candidates&apos; actual election expenses up to a limit of half his legally permittedmaximum expenditure. Payment shall be made directly to the candidate.It is recommended that the first payment of the proposed annual grants payable to the parties should be on I April 1977, and that the scheme for the limitedreimbursement of candidates&apos; election expenses should operate for all Parha-mentary and relevant local government elections held on or after 1 April 1977.The total cost of state aid to the political parties under these proposals isestimated at, on average, about  2J million a year. Of this, the annual grants tothe parties would comprise about  1,440,000 and the reimbursement of candi-dates&apos; election expenses approximately  860,000 a year (including  360,000 inrespect of Parliamentary candidates and  500,000 for local government candi-dates).It is proposed that the reimbursement schemes should be extended to includeelections to the European Parliament and to the Scottish and Welsh Assembliesas occasion arises.
CHAPTER 1BACKGROUNDIntroduction1.1 The Committee was set up by the Government in May 1975, with thefollowing terms of reference :-&quot;To consider whether, in the interests of Parliamentary democracy,provision should be made from public funds to assist political parties in carrying out their functions outside Parliament; to examine the practiceof other Parliamentary democracies in this field, and to make recommenda-tions as to the scope of political activities to which any such provision should relate and the method of its allocation.&quot;1.2 The Committee has met 32 times. Visits have been made to Austria,the Federal Republic of Germany, The Netherlands and Sweden, and individual members have visited Washington and Paris.1.3 The establishment of the Committee formed part of a broader initiativeconcerning the work of the political parties both inside and outside Parliament.The Lord President of the Council (Mr Edward Short) had announced on29JulyI974that:-(a) financial aid would be provided for opposition parties in Parliament;(i) a select committee of Members of Parliament would be set up toexamine the support facilities available to back-bench Members;(c) an independent committee would be set up to look at the questionof financial assistance for political parties in respect of their workoutside ParliamentThis last proposal foreshadowed the establishment of this Committee.1.4 Financial aid to opposition parties to assist them in carrying out their parliamentary work was approved by the House of Commons on 20 March 197?.Under this scheme opposition parties are able to claim financial iFrfatmwyin respect of expenses incurred in carrying out their Parliamentary businessup to an annual limit based on  500 for each seat won by the party concernedplus  1 for every 200 votes cast for it at the preceding general election, subjectto a mftX1&apos;1&quot;1&apos;1&quot; of  150,000 for any one party. In order to qualify for assistancea party must either have had at least two Members of Parliament elected atthe previous general election, or had one Member elected and received a mini-mum of 150,000 votes. Under this formula  203,570 is currently payable tothe opposition parties annually, including a maximum of  150,000 to theprincipal opposition party.15 A select Committee on Assistance to Private Members was set up by theHouse of Commons in December 1974 with the following terms of reference :-&quot;To examine the present support facilities available to Private members in carrying out their duties in this House, in particular research assistance on matters before Parliament and to make recommendations for suchimprovements as they consider necessary.&quot;
The reports made by this Committee recommended considerable increases inMembers&apos; secretarial and research assistance, in order that each Membershould be in a position to employ a full-time secretary and a research assistant.The Committee stressed, however, that the assistance they were proposingwould be personal to the individual Member, and should not be regarded as anindirect subsidy to the patty organisations. * The Committee&apos;s recommenda-tions have not so far been implemented, bat the House of Commons accepted in July 1975 a recommendation made by the Top Salaries Review Body toincrease substantially the Members&apos; secretarial allowance to  3,200 a year, andfor this to be available for either secretarial or research assistance. This allowance was recently raised to  3,512 a year.1.6 Aside from these particular initiatives, the question of the financing ofpolitical parties cannot be isolated from more general constitutional develop-ments. There has in recent years been a widespread questioning of many ofour institutions of government, Parliamentary and otherwise. In particular,the whole structure of local government has been radically reorganised; a majorrevision of procedure in the House of Commons has recently begun; the implications of our membership of the European Economic Community arestill being absorbed; and new national assemblies are in prospect for Scotlandand Wales. It is in this context of widespread re-examination, reform and renewalthat this examination of the financing of the political parties has to be considered.Existing aid.7 State aid to the political parties has hitherto been principally confined to the indirect benefit that parties derive from the fact that Members of Parlia-ment receive a Parliamentary salary and allowances and from the schemeintroduced in 1975 (see paragraph 1.4) for financial assistance to opposition parties.1.8 The state also provides political parties with certain aid in kind, mainlyat election times. It is not possible to put a precise figure on this assistance,but the following paragraphs give some general indication of its present extent.Registration1.9 In some countries political parties incur a great deal of expense in ensuring the registration of everyone entitled to vote. In the United States, for example,whilst the state pays for the actual registration process it is left to the partiesto encourage individuals to register. This is normally done by means of expensivepublicity drives conducted on television and in the press. In the United Kingdomlocal authorities are responsible for all aspects of registration, and in 1973-74local authorities (excluding Northern Ireland) spent a net total of  6,025,000on this service.!&quot;Select Committee on Assistance to Private Members, Second Report, paragraph 16,HC 662, October 1975.tLocal Government Financial Statistics (England and Wales), 1973-74.

Postage1.10 A Parliamentary candidate is entitled to send free of any postal charge to each elector one postal communication containing matter relating to theelection only. The Post Office is reimbursed by the Treasury and for the GeneralElection in October 1974 received  2-1 million, covering the cost of delivery of 75 million communications. At current postal rates the cost would be 3-9 million.Meeting halls1.11 During a Parliamentary or local election campaign a candidate is entitledto hold meetings in schools which are situated in his or an adjoining con-stituency. For Parliamentary elections this entitlement also extends to any meeting rooms available for public meetings that are maintained wholly or mainly out of public funds. The candidate is not required to pay for the hireof the room, but he has to pay for any heating, lighting and cleaning costs.Broadcasting1.12 During a general election campaign the allocation of broadcasting time is decided by a committee of party representatives and the broadcasting authori-ties. Apart from election campaigns, the committee decide each year on theparty political broadcasting arrangements for the following year. The number and length of non-election broadcasts are related to votes received in theprevious general election. In 1974 there were in total 18 television and 26 radionon-election party political broadcasts.&apos;1.13 No charge is made to the parties for any of their radio broadcasts.For television, the expense to the parties need only be small-generally no more than  100. If the parties had to buy advertising time on the ITV televisionnetwork in toe usual way the cost would, of course, be very considerable.Recent Developments1.14 Under the Referendum Act 1975 grants of  125,000 each were authorisedto the two &quot;umbrella&quot; campaigning organisations, Britain in Europe and theNational Referendum Campaign. The Government also printed and distributedat public expense a document by each of the organisations setting out their side of the case. The overall assistance from public funds was about  1) million.1.15 The two organisations produced detailed accounts which were auditedby the Comptroller and the Auditor General and published in a White Paperpresented to Parliament by the Lord President of the Council in October 1975(Cmnd 6251).1.16 During the course of our work two further developments affected out enquiry. The first was the Governmenfs White Paper &quot;Our ChangingDemocracy: Devolution to Scotland and Wales&quot; (Cmnd 6348), presented toParliament in November 1975. This White Paper put forward proposals for*BBC Handbook 1976.
devolving some functions of the Westminster Parliament to Assemblies inScotland and Wales. Elections to these Assemblies would clearly make for additional costs to the political parties.1.17 The second was the publication of the Green Paper &quot;Direct Elections tothe European Assembly&quot; (Cmnd 6399) in February 1976. This was a consultativepaper about the elections of members of the European Parliament. Part HIset out the matters for decision by the United Kingdom Parliament on theconduct of elections, but financial arrangements for the elections were not discussed. Nevertheless, it became clear that the political parties in the UnitedKingdom would be concerned in these elections, and that the financial arrangements and expenditure incurred would be a matter of concern to theCommittee.Northern ireland.18 Since we were appointed the Constitutional Convention was elected towork out s new constitution for Northern Ireland. The constitution proposedby that Convention was unacceptable to the Government, and consequently,after further meetings at which it was unable to make progress, the convention was dissolved on 5 March 1976. We understand that it is unlikely to be re-convened. The position is, therefore, that Northern Ireland continues to be governed directly from Westminster. There seems no likelihood in theimmediate furore of a regional or devolved government there. Political partiesis Northern Ireland, therefore, are most apparent in local government elections and in the elections for the United Kingdom Parliament at Westminster.1.19 The Northern Ireland parties function regionally and the major UnitedKingdom parties barely feature there. National parties based on the concept of nationhood, such as the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru, do not exist in Northern Ireland. Instead, there are a number of parties based broadlyon different proposals for the ultimate constitutional status of NorthernIreland.1.20 In response to our invitation, we received written evidence from someNorthern Ireland parties (see paragraph 2.24). We decided that in view of thepolitical situation in Northern Ireland we would not ask the parties there tocome to see us. We concluded that in the circumstances we could not usefullymake recommendations on whether aid Bhould be given to parties in con-nection with any future Northern Ireland legislature.OutUne of our work.21 From the start of our enquiry we have appreciated the need for urgencybecause of the continuing effects of inflation and the two 1974 General Electionson the financial position of the parties. We decided at an early stage that wemust aim at reporting by the summer of 1976.1.22 It has also been the Committee&apos;s aim from the outset that the evidence we took should be as broadly bated as possible. We have sought facto andopinions not only from the political parties themselves, but also from a wide
range of other public and private bodies with a general or specialised interestin our enquiry. We have been anxious, too, that apart from those known tohave a particular interest in this subject, members of the general public shouldalso have an opportunity to express their opinion.1.23 As a first step we sent out invitations to give evidence to a number of interested organisations, including political parties, academic bodies, and representatives of local authority interests, the trades union movement, andof commerce and industry. We also invited certain individual firms and tradeunions, as well as a number of persons in political and academic life withspecial knowledge in these matters, to give the Committee the benefit of theirviews. An invitation to the general public to give evidence was extended throughthe Press.1.24 As a result of these invitations we received a great deal of informationboth from organisations and individuals, for which we are grateful. A list ofthe organisations and individuals who gave evidence is at Annex A togetherwith a copy of a list of questions sent by us to our witnesses. There was littleresponse to our general public invitation, although some organisations didsubmit papers as the work of the Committee became more widely known.1.25 Despite the valuable evidence which we received as a result of theseinvitations, however, it soon became clear to the Committee that there was still a lack of sufficient evidence in several areas of enquiry if the Committeewere to have a satisfactory factual basis for their recoimnendations. In parti-cular, there appeared a need for more detailed material covering the changesin the financial position of the central organisations of the parties in recentyears; the situation of the parties at local level; the attitude of the general publictowards the possibility of the introduction of state aid to political parties; and,finally, in accordance with our terms of reference, for evidence on the experienceof other countries who have introduced such aid.1.26 In order to provide this evidence we found it necessary to undertake anumber of special surveys and enquiries. For this work we received assistancefrom a number of individuals and organisations. We should like to express ourthanks to Professor Louis Moss (formerly of the Government Social Survey),Dr David Butler, Professor Martin Harrison, Professor Richard Rose, Dr IvorCrewe, Dr Michael Pinto-Duscbinsky and Dr Michael Tappin, who at various stages helped us with comments and advice. We are particularly grateful alsoto the Central Statistical Office for their assistance in connection with thesesurveys.Outline of report.27 The succeeding chapters in this Report largely reflect the evidence we received as a result of our requests for evidence and our subsequent enquiries.Chapter 2 summarises generally the views expressed to us; Chapter 3 reviewsthe work of the parties; Chapter 4 examines the financial position of the partiesat the centre; Chapter 5 is concerned with the constituencies; Chapter 6 sum-marises the overall income of the parties; Chapter 7 is concerned with what
the public thinks about the question of state aid to political parties; Chapter 8deals with foreign practice; Chapter 9 presents thecasefor state aid; Chapter 10contains our recommendations and Chapter 11 our conclusions.1.28 A minority of the Committee considered that there was no case for theintroduction of state aid in present circumstances. Their views are expressedin a Minority Report (see page 75). Sir Edmund Compton, whilst associatinghimself with the majority of the Committee, has submitted a note of reservationon one aspect of the Report (see page 74).
CHAPTER 2THE VIEWS OF THE PARTIES AND OTHER WITNESSESIntroduction2.1 This chapter summarises the views put to us on state aid for political parties by the parties themselves and by other organisations and individuals.These are set out as follows: Political partiesCommerce and industryTrade unionsOther groupsIndividual witnessesLocal governmentConstituency officers- paragraphs 2J. to 2.24- paragraphs 2.25 to 2.28- paragraphs 2.29 to 2.33- paragraphs 2.34 to 2.36- paragraphs 2.37 to 2.39- paragraphs 2.40 to 2.41- paragraphs 2.42 to 2.55Political parties the Conservative Party2.2 The Conservative Party Organisation opposed state aid. It would, intheir view, diminish the party&apos;s ability to provide an effective countervailingforce to the power of the state and state bureaucracy. Moreover, althoughinflation has hit political parties, they are not atone in suffering these effects,and there would be no justification for their receiving preferential treatmentover other voluntary organisations. Any inability on the part of parties to attract voluntary support is an indication of general public disillusionmentwith politics.. State aid would only lead to further alienation. It would alsodamage local political activity in so far as its focal point is voluntary fundraising, which provides a large proportion of the Conservative Party&apos;s total income.2.3 These views were shared and reinforced by the Central Fife ConservativeAssociation, Tory Action and by Mr Russell Lewis, of the Sefsdon Group.The National Society of Conservative and Unionist Agents also gave evidence.They argued that more money is needed to strengthen the party organisation,but they did not commit themselves on the question as to whether or notstate aid should be introduced.The Labour Party2.4 The Labour Party stated categorically that political parties are indis-pensable to parliamentary democracy and that they cannot function properlyin current circumstances without state aid. Parties are essential to conununica-tion between the electors and the government; to proper policy formulation;and to the running of elections. Such activities are being restricted becauseof present financial difficulties. Some injection of public funds is therefore necessary. State aid is not new in principle. Aid for parties is already providedfor candidates at elections, and in certain respects for parties-for example,
special broadcasting facilities and aid to opposition parties in ParliamentParties must be allowed to decide for themselves without state interferencehow further state aid could best be used. Any subsidy should therefore go tothe national headquarters as being in the best position to decide how it shouldbe allocated.2.5 The scheme of state aid proposed by the Labour Parry was fox an exchequer grant to go to all parties subject to a minimum level of parlia-mentary representation. This amount should be calculated on a combinationeither of seats and votes won, or of seats won and the number of partycandidates who save their deposits. It should be conditional on a limitationof donations from other sources, although not on affiliation fees. They didnot favour a flat-rate grant, or one based on votes only, or one matching a party*s income from other sources.2.6 The National Union of Labour Party Organisers put the case for strongerparty organisation. They said that because of low salaries, good calibre agentswere not being recruited. Voluntary staff cannot effectively substitute for full-time agents, and the continuing reduction in the number of professionalstaff meant an inevitable decline in the services provided by the parties to thepublic generally.The Co-operative Party2.7 The Co-operative Party stated that until recently they would have beenoverwhelmingly opposed to state aid. They now considered, however, thatgovernment influence had become so extensive, particularly in economic and consumer affairs, that the parties had to be better equipped to exerciseeffective control and supervision of government institutions; their research and training departments particularly needed to be improved. The electorsthemselves needed more education in democratic practice and procedures.The parties were unlikely to be able to finance such extra activities from their traditional sources of income; subsidies from public funds were therefore desirable.2.8 The Co-operative Party advocated a fixed grant, not determined as a proportion of total expenditure or of expenditure in any particular field.They made so recommendations ons about the amount of state aid to be given orthe method of its allocation.The Liberal Party2.9 The liberal Party gave evidence in their constituent federal units,England, Wales and Scotland. The Liberal Party (England) presented themain evidence. It argued that parries are necessary to democracy but,because of present difficulties, they are all operating well below the levels necessary to ensure the proper functioning of parliamentary democracyin this country. Because of inadequate funds, parties are failing to carryout enough research, to establish adequate communications with the electorate,or to encourage political education. The British in effect are &quot;getting their
politics on the cheap&quot; and, as a consequence, are getting bad politics. Stateaid would enable parties to develop properly researched policies, and to engage in a greater degree of political education.2.10 A further advantage of state subsidies would be that they would reducethe dependence of the two main parties, and particularly the Labour Party,on corporate finance. The Liberal Party has never received long-term mstitu-tional support, and consequently has traditionally relied for its central incomeon trusts and donations from a small number of wealthy individuals. this number is now decreasing and the Liberal Party are therefore at a disadvantagecompared with the Conservative and Labour parties in not having institu-tional support. Such a situation has a harmful effect on democracy in Britain.2.11 State aid should be given for specific purposes and should be designedto encourage maximum voluntary support, to encourage political activity,and to reduce the risk of excessive powers going to the party headquarters.The Liberals&apos; proposals are linked to a number of changes proposed for electoralprocedures, the replacement of the deposit system by a large number ofnominating signatures and a fixed parliamentary term of four years.2.12 Under the Liberal Party scheme an annual  8 million political fund would be set aside by the government from general taxation, based on a calcula-tion of 20p per registered voter. Any voter who wished to have his 20p withdrawnfrom the fund could write to the Inland Revenue notifying them of his wishto contract out This fund would be used for two main purposes: to strengthen the regional organisations of all parties; and to be channelled through aPolitical Research Council to the parties for research, political education,information and training. Such a subsidy would be allocated to the parties in proportion to the votes cast for each party at general elections. It should not,however, exceed 50% of a party&apos;s income overall or 75% of the income atnational and regional levels. State aid should be conditional on a limitation ofdonationsabove  500.2.13 Money should also be raised for political parties by means of a &quot;taxcheck-off&quot; system somewhat similar to the one used in the United States forthe Presidential Campaign Fund (see paragraph 10.15). Broadly speaking,an individual should be able to allocate part of his income tax to any political party at any level he wished, by making his choice known on his income taxform. The Inland Revenue would then be directed to allocate that money tothe particular group concerned.2.14 Further state aid should be given by reimbursing 75% of candidates&apos;permitted maximum expenses in all elections above County Council level-that is for elections to Parliament, to the Scottish and Welsh Assemblies,and to the European Parliament. Printing and posting of election addressesand the travelling expenses, within maximum limits, of all national officers and members of the national executive should be met by the state. Civil servantsshould be seconded to parties&apos; organisations; and local government informationcentres should be set up.
2.15 Finally, there should be a registrar of elections and political parties to supervise the running of these schemes.2.16 The Welsh Liberal Party agreed generally with the Liberal Party(England)&apos;s schemes. State aid should be directed to research, regional organisa-tion and, in Wales, to county organisations. It also supported tax concessions on donations.2.17 The Liberal Party agents supported state aid of a limited but differentkind. Parties, to operate properly, should be able to rely on a firm financial basis. The aid should accordingly be directed to those constituencies in greatest need. A grant of  3,000 a year should be given through the national headquartersto all constituency organisations gaining at least one-eighth of the votes castat the previous general election. This would enable professional agents to beemployed to provide constituents with the necessary point of contact with both their Member of Parliament and central and local government. The sumso fixed would make it necessary for constituencies still to raise part of themoney.2.18 The evidence of the Scottish Liberal Party differed from the otherLiberal evidence. They argued that the introduction of state aid could wellbe more damaging than actual poverty, and that it would be wrong to compel the public to contribute through taxation what they declined to give voluntarily.State subsidy would have the damaging effect of reducing the voluntary effortneeded for fund raising. They questioned whether research should be conducted by the parties, and took the view that strengthening the party organisationand employing agents was not really deserving of support from public funds.If, however, state aid ever were to be introduced, it should be allocated inrelation to the votes cast. It should be earmarked for specific projects, andchannelled to the constituencies rather than to headquarters. It should also be accompanied by a monetary ceiling on donations received from any othersingle source, and by a ceiling on expenditure by any party. Donations should,however, be encouraged by tax concessions and a &quot;tax check-off&quot; scheme.77ie Scottish National Party2,19 The Scottish National Party, although it believes that political parties are essential to democratic government, is of the opinion that the right freelyto withdraw support from a political party is as vital a democratic right asthat freely to grant such support. It, therefore, considers that any directsubsidising of political parties from public funds would be inimical todemocracy. The interests of parliamentary democracy are not being endangeredby the poverty of the parties; state aid would be used merely to shore up thoseparties unable to attract a sufficient income. While more money would be welcomed, the party is confident that adequate support for its developing rolewill be received through voluntary effort and subscriptions. On the otherhand, public funds should be used for improving research facilities and services for Members of Parliament and Assembly members; nor would it be unreason-able for the state to meet the cost of printing as well as distributing electionaddresses by candidates.
2.20 Like other of our witnesses the Scottish National Party argued that state aid, if introduced, should be accompanied by certain conditions asregards institutional donations. There should be a statutory requirement to make public all political contributions, and payments from company funds should be made only with the agreement of the shareholders. The trade unionpolitical levy should be changed from a basis of &quot;contracting out&quot; to one of&quot;contracting in&quot;.Plaid Cymru2.21 Plaid Cymru similarly opposed state aid as a device to bolster ailingparties no longer able to attract sufficient voluntary support. It is essential for parliamentary democracy that parties should remain responsive to the will of their supporters, and for this reason Plaid Cymru were prepared to stand or fall by their members&apos; support State aid would stifle emergingparties and make existing parties dependent on the state. Moreover, theymistrusted the intentions of the major parties; from their own experience overthe allocation of party political broadcasting time they suspected that minorparties would be denied their proper share of the facilities by the state. Ifstate aid is to be introduced at all it should be linked to specific items such asresearch.2.22 Plaid Cymru, like the Scottish National Party and the Scottish Liberals,were strongly critical of all institutional aid. Their remedy is to restrict institu-tional support to some 25% of a party&apos;s overall expenditure.The Communist Party2.23 The Communist Party were prepared to accept a small extension of aidin kind for candidates, such as a free postal service for election material inmunicipal elections. Nevertheless they opposed state aid in the form of cashfor parties; this would in their view put parties in a position of dependence on public funds, thus harming the democratic system since parties should besensitive to their members&apos; opinions. Subsidies would do nothing to revivepolitical life or restore the prestige of Parliament and local government.The Northern Ireland Parties2.24 Broadly speaking, the Northern Ireland parties expressed the same range of views as those outlined above. Evidence was received from five parties;two were in favour of state aid, one was strongly opposed and two did not offerfirm views. Both the Social Democratic and Labour Party and the unionist party of Northern Ireland considered state aid to be necessary to enable theparties to improve their organisation and extend their research activities. the ulster Unionist Party, on the other hand, opposed state aid on the grounds that it would be likely to lead to a reduction in voluntary support and a greatercentralisation of administrative and political power within the parties. TheNorthern Ireland Labour Party supported state aid if limited to financingeducational activities. In their view a general subsidy would tend to give partiestoo much independence from their support in the country, and might tend to obstruct progress towards unity in Northern Ireland. The Alliance Party ofNorthern Ireland said that state aid, if given, should be restricted to partiesthat had demonstrated their ability to win significant electoral support.
Conunerce and Iadnstry2.23 The Confederation of British Industry came down reluctantly in favourof a limited form of state aid. They conceded that political parties are findingit difficult to raise funds. Government grants could with advantage be givento improve both research, particularly on the economy and industry, andpolitical education among the public. Nevertheless, parties should have tofind the bulk of their money from their own sources so that they remain sensitiveand responsive to the opinion of their supporters. To encourage individualdonations, there should be tax concessions on gifts up to a maximum of  50;there should be no limitation on political donations from private industry.2.26 State aid should be based on votes and seats in the last two general elections, although allocations should have some regard to the amounts raised from private sources. Parties receiving state aid should have to disclose their income from specified broad categories of donors.2.27 As against this view, British United Industrialists and the Association of independent Businesses argued that state aid should not be given. British UnitedIndustrialists were in favour of the present system of donations by individuals and companies. The Association of Independent Businesses, together withAims for Freedom and Enterprise, advocated increased research facilities for members of Parliament. Aims for Freedom and Enterprise also proposed betterpay for Members of Parliament; the abolition of the trade union political levyor, at least, a return to &quot;contracting in&quot; arrangements; and the introductionof a &quot;tax check-off&quot; scheme.2.28 The Committee also invited evidence from a number of individual firms,including some who made political donations. There was no concerted view,but there was general agreement in the evidence that donations to political parties, where given, were based on consideration of commercial interests only.Some firms were against state aid, but others were in favour; of those in favour,some wanted state aid made conditional on the limitation of donations and contributions from other sources, apart from individual subscriptions.Trade Unions2.29 We were advised that the Trades Union Congress would not give formalcollective evidence because it contains a wide variety of unions, some, but not all, having political affiliations. Consequently we approached a number of individual trade unions, including some who sponsored candidates forParliament2.30 Certain trade unions, including the Engineering and the TechnicalAdministrative and Supervisory Sections of the Amalgamated Union of engineering Workers (AEUW), the Union of Mineworkers (NUM), theUnion of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians (UCATT) and theUnion of Agricultural and Allied Workers (saw) were against state aid.The NUM, however, suggested that state aid in kind should be increased andUCATT deplored the inadequate facilities available to Members of parliament and wanted them increased.
2.31 Other unions were in favour of state aid. A strongly argued memorandum in support of state aid was submitted by the Transport and General WorkersUnion (TGWU). This said that political parties are necessary in their present form, but that their work is taken for granted by the public, and that theirorganisations had been run down. State aid is urgently needed, but shouldbe related to specific activities. Other sources of income for the parties shouldbe unrestricted and local activities encouraged. Aid should be directed towardsproviding parties with headquarters, party newspapers and with printing and distributing election broadsheets. Overall expenditure of the parties should,however, be limited, in order to prevent the costs of election campaigns fromrising too fast.2.32 The Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs (ASTMS)also gave evidence, coming down reluctantly in favour of state aid. their general view was that parties not receiving enough money must lack genuinepublic support, and should not be shored up by state aid. Nevertheless they felt that in present circumstances the poverty of all parties made state aidnecessary. Such aid should be based on present electoral practice, particularly on the deposit system for general elections; all candidates who save theirdeposits should be refunded their election expenses in full, payments beingmade to the local political party nominated by the candidate. At national level,there should be an overall limit on election expenditure, determined by the total amount of allowable election expenses for all the constituencies being contestedby that party. After the election the national party should be paid a sum equalto the maximum allowable election expenses for every candidate who saved hisdeposit, provided that at least ten of the party&apos;s candidates saved their deposits.The scheme would produce, on the basis of the February 1974 General Electionresults, about  1,000,000 each for the Labour and Conservative parties; 800,000 for the Liberals;  100,000 for the Scottish National Party;  16,000for Plaid Cymru, and  17,000 for the United Ulster Unionist Coalition.Payment of this money would be spread over four years and should be availablefor general purposes.2.33 The Association of Professional, Executive and Computer Staffs XAP^X)believed that it would be in the interests of democracy in Britain for some stateaid to be given to the political parties, although they appreciated the precedentthis would set. They considered that any such aid must be strictly defined and controlled. The links between Members of Parliament and their constituenciesneeded to be strengthened, perhaps by the provision of more agents. Thereshould also be better party support for Members of Parliament at Westminster.Other Groups2.34 The Political Association, an association of teachers of politics, concluded that the partial public funding of parties is necessary in the current situation.Poor public support of the parties is due to the deficiencies in systematic civiceducation in Britain, Increased finance would help the parties to establish more effective communication with the public. Subscriptions and donations fromtrade union and industrial sources should continue. Money from public funds,to the order possibly of  300,000 per year, should be given only for research and &quot;evaluation functions&quot; induding market research. The subsidy should not
be used for organisation (for example, the salaries of agents) or for electioncampaigns. State aid should be allocated to the parties according to votes cast,perhaps with a minimum qualification of 5 % of the votes cast and a ceilingfor any one party of 50% of the money provided.2.35 The Politics Association, like other political scientists from whom we received evidence, considered that parties should be required to adopt proceduresinvolving all members in the selection of candidates. Similarly, all members should be involved in the formulation of policy. Subsidising parties would help restore their prestige and make them a more acceptable part of Britishdemocracy.2.36 We also saw representatives of Political and Economic Planning (PEP)who gave their personal support to the view expressed in a booklet written by Mr Dick Leonard, which PEP had recently published. This study, entitled&quot;Paying for Party Politics: the Case for Public Subsidies&quot;, examines state aid to political parties in a number of countries, including, in detail, Germany,Sweden and Finland. It concludes that British parties were impoverished even before the recent years of inflation, and are now suffering also from a declinein membership. State aid of about  10,000,000 a year is desirable to supplement,not replace, existing income. It should neither fossilise the existing position ofthe parties, nor encourage splinter parties. Half the subsidy should go tothe headquarters of each party, based on the number of Parliamentary seatsheld, and half should go to the constituencies, based on the number of votesfor each party in that constituency.IfKUTtfnaJ witnesses2.37 We saw, and received written evidence from, a number of individualsconnected with the universities and the political parties. The names of thosewho gave evidence are given in Annex A. Fourteen individual witnesses ap-appeared before the Committee and 13 submitted written evidence. We were much impressed by the quality of the evidence we received, and are grateful to all these witnesses for their invaluable assistance.238 Not unexpectedly, the views we received ranged from unreserved support to absolute opposition. Those in favour of state aid emphasised the dependence of a healthy parliamentary democracy upon the existence of vigorous and effective political parties. The parties were failing to carry out sufficient research and, because of inadequate organisation, to stimulate political activity at local level; a lack of finance was seen as being one of the principal causes ofthese deficiencies. They considered that the necessary additional resources would either not be forthcoming, or would be provided mainly by trade unions and industry and so would increase the parties&apos; dependence on these sources.Some witnesses saw the provision of public subsidy as a means of effecting areform of the parties, for example by making the grant conditional upon theintroduction of new procedures for candidate selection. Others saw it as a means of changing the balance of administrative and political power withinthe parties, or of loosening the ties between the parties and their traditionalsources of income.
2.39 Most of the witnesses who opposed state aid recognised that the parties were currently short of money, but they considered that the parties should raisethe necessary money by their own efforts. Public subsidy would be likely toshore up ailing parties that no longer deserved support and could also weaken the parties&apos; links with their traditional supporters. At a time of economicstringency, a decision by the parties to vote themselves a state subventionwould inevitably result in a loss of public esteem which would be reflected in alack of respect for the country&apos;5 democratic institutions.Local Government2.40 The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Association&apos;ofLocal Authorities in Northern Ireland declined to give evidence, and we receivednone from the Association of Metropolitan Authorities. From the other associa-tions we received fairly brief replies. The Association of County Councils took the view that while political parties were clearly short of money there was no evidence that this was damaging democracy at local government level. TheAssociation of District Councils felt that any state aid should be given at national level and should come from Exchequer funds.2.41 We received more detailed views from the two largest local authoritiesin Britain, the Greater London Council and the Strathctyde Regional Council.The Greater London Council was divided on the issue. We were informedthat a motion supporting state aid was rejected in favour of another motionarguing that public support of parties should not be extended without strictproof of benefit to the population as a whole and independent investigation bya completely impartial body; no state aid should be given at regional and localauthority level. The supporters of this motion, drawn from both conservative and Labour parties, felt that state aid brought a risk of political interference in administration. The Strathclyde Regional Council, on the other hand, sentus memoranda showing support for state aid both from Labour and Conserva-tives; only the independent group opposed it. The arguments put forwardwere the need to give more support to local councillors and strengthen political parties in local government. Money for support at local level should come fromthe rates.ConstrtoeDcy Officers2.42 We also received views on state aid as part of a survey of parties in 100constituencies, described in Chapter 5. As a final question in that survey weasked whether the party officers completing the questionnaire would give ustheir personal views on state aid. The question posed was as follows: &quot;The Committee is looking at the proposal that political parties shouldbe given state aid, in some form, for their activities outside Parliament.Some state aid is already given chiefly to candidates for general and local elections. We are interested in your personal views on this question. Weshould make it clear that your answers will not commit you or your localparty in any way.&quot;IS
2.43 Out of a possible 350 party organisations, 264 replies were received onthis question made up as follows: Labour 91Conservative 84Liberal 80SNP5Plaid Cymni 4The replies were given sometimes by the secretary /agent, sometimes by the partytreasurer, sometimes by the party chairman, and in some instances collectivelyby the party officers. The views expressed were entirely personal and did not commit the party organisations in any way.Labour Party2.44 From the officers in the Labour Party organisations-91 there was a clear majority in favour of state aid 69 as against 10 who opposed it; 5 expressed a neutral view, and 7 made no comment.2.45 The reasons given in support of state aid were as follows: it was necessaryin order to overcome the parties&apos; present financial difficulties; it would helprelieve the ome-ccmsuriiing and discouraging burden of fund-raising; and partyworkers needed to be better paid to arrest the recent decline in the quantity and quality of full-time paid staff. State aid should go towards providing morefull-time agents; better election expenditure; rate relief; research. Some suggestedstate aid in kind; for example, free post, telephones, stationery, printing facilities,office accommodation and transport.2.46 The officers who opposed state aid stated that: it might lessen voluntaryparticipation by party workers; parties should retain their dignity and inde-pendence and achieve survival by their own efforts; non-democratic partiesmight receive the money; and it would be undemocratic to force people who hadno political interests to contribute to the parties through taxation.Conservative Party2.47 Of the replies from the Conservative signatories, 39 were against stateaid; 32 were in favour; 6 expressed no positive view one way or the other; and 7did not comment2.48 Their case for state aid was on the same lines as that advanced by theLabour Party officers. State aid was necessary to overcome the present difficultiesof the parties and ensure their survival; and it would give party workers more time for political activities. The following uses for state aid were put forward:election costs; agents&apos; salaries; constituency costs; research and training. Theextension of the free post arrangements for general elections to local authorityelections was also suggested.2.49 Those who opposed state aid put forward the following reasons: it would damage voluntary support and participation; it would deprive the parties of
their independence; it would encourage small parties; it was too uncertain a source of income since it could be withdrawn at any time; it would assistnon-democratic parties such as the Communists; it would waste money; andthe public should not be forced to contribute to parties through taxation.Liberal Party2.50 Of the 80 replies from officials in the Liberal orgarusatioris, 63 supportedstate aid; 10 were opposed; 6 were neutral, and 1 did not comment.2.51 The view of those who supported state aid was that: it would enableparty workers to spend more time on political activities; the Liberal Party wouldbe able to compete on more equal terms with other parties who were backed bythe trade unions and industry; it would overcome the parties&apos; present financial difficulties; it would make parties more efficient and increase membership; itwould reduce the dependence of any party on individual or group benefactors.The following objects for state aid were advanced: it should go to employ morefull-time staff; or to purchase office furniture or other equipment; or to election expenses; it should be given in kind by way of free post, office accommodation,and free telephones.2.52 Those who opposed state aid believed that; it would bring about a declinein voluntary support and participation; it would be squandered; it would assistsmall parties with no genuine public support; it would result in the loss of independence by parties and the risk of state interference; and the.taxpayersshould not be forced to help political parties.Scottish National Party2.53 The replies from the five Scottish National Party officials opposed stateaid. Four said they believed that a party that could not survive by its own efforts should not be shored up by subsidies; and one felt that state aid would perpetuatethe current political situation.Plaid Cymru2.54 Of the four Plaid Cymm replies, three opposed state aid and one expressedno view. State aid was opposed because it would encourage the development of acorporate slate; there were better uses for public money in the present financial situation; it would weaken voluntary effort and would help only the mainparties.2.55 To sum up, the replies received were as follows:-PartyRepliesreceivedla favour ofstate aidOpposed tosuite aidNeutral or no commentLabour ...ConservativeLiberal   ...9184805469326310391051Z13&apos;7Scottish NationalPlaid Cymru31
CHAPTER 3THE WORK OF THE PARTIESGeneral3.1 We outline in this chapter what we see as the purpose and main tasks ofpolitical parties.3.2 Political parties are essential because they carry out a number of vitalfunctions in our political and parliamentary life which cannot be successfullyundertaken in any other way. Parties are the agencies through which the electorate can express its collective will. However much some people maydislike, or even despise, party politics, some kind of recognised groupingof citizens with broadly similar political views is indispensable to our systemof representative government.3.3 In Parliament itself, if reasonable stability of government and consistencyof direction are to be maintained, Ministers must have the general support ofthe House of Commons. A government cannot normally carry on for longwithout a working majority. This requires some form of party system in theHouse. Moreover, the party political system in Parliament provides an orderlyframework within which political leaders can emerge, develop, and strive for political office.3.4 Political parties not only form the essential basis for stable governmentin an elected Parliament: they are also the means whereby members of thegeneral public are able to participate in the formulation of policies. Throughthe links which they provide between Parliament and the constituencies, theypromote and maintain political awareness within society at all levels. they provide the framework within which differing political views can be formulated,debated and translated into practical political programmes, and the manydemands and efforts of smaller groups in society can be aggregated and mergedinto a small number of workable alternative political programmes. If sufficientcandidates for election to Parliament support a party group from which agovernment may be formed to carry out its policies, that group is fulfilling the role of a political party. If a body of electors with broadly similar views canachieve the election of a sufficient number of Members to ensure that the policies and actions of the government party are fully debated and scrutinised, that body too is fulfilling an essential role in our political system.3.5 Out of the need for a party system of political groupings in parliament has naturally evolved an almost universal practice of selecting and nominatingcandidates for election to Parliament on a &quot;party ticket&quot;. These selectionsare made by the respective political parties in the constituencies and this addsto their importance and responsibility. On this process of selection dependsthe quality of Members of Parliament and ultimately the quality of ministers and the competence of government. It is therefore important that the politicalforces behind candidates and Members of Parliament should be effective and well-informed. No other system would, in our view, provide an alternativeacceptable to the people of this country.
3.6 Accepting that the existence of political parties is an essential feature of our system of parliamentary democracy, it surely follows that they shouldperform their role as effectively as possible. Are they doing so? Have theyadequate tools for the job of politics in a modern state and a maturedemocracy? Or are they pedalling what Sir Harold Wilson once described as&quot;a penny-farthing machine&quot; ? Policies apart, do the parties maintain reasonablestandards of management and organisation? Do they command the means andthe resources necessary to fulfil their primary purpose of providing the structure within which alternative policies on major national issues can be formulated and determined, from the local ward level to the top?3.7 In their wider context, these questions can only be answered as a matterof broad judgement. It would be difficult to lay down a generally agreedschedule of essential party activities, or to specify in any detail what the nationexpects of them. Obviously the people want good government, well thought-outpolicies for internal order and external security and economic and socialmanagement, and a country with a satisfying way of life which reasonablecitizens and their families will find worthwhile. But political parties are voluntary bodies; each sees its functions and its priorities differently, and in our viewthey should continue to be able to do so.3.8 The parties themselves expressed in evidence varying views as to how wellthey were able to carry out what they saw as their necessary functions, centrallyand in the constituencies1. The Conservative Party gave evidence in general terms on the financial difficulties confronting them, but did not name anyparticular areas of work where they might be prevented by shortage of money from carrying out essential tasks.3.9 The evidence from the Labour and Liberal parties was, however, somewhatmore specific. They acknowledged that there were serious shortcomings, actualand potential, in their respective organisations, their communications withthe electorate and in their research effort. The Labour Party expressed concernas to how far as they would be able to maintain their existing level of activities in the near future. The Liberal Party pointed to recent cut-backs they had been forced to introduce to help deal with their present financial problems.3.10 The results of our survey of public opinion (see Chapter 7) producedcriticisms of the way in which the parties were now bejng operated, and showed that there was substantial support, for example, for the proposal that moreresources should be allotted to the formulation of party policy and to research.Moreover, whilst people generally felt that parties should communicate their policies to the public, many thought that they were not, in practice, keeping in sufficiently close contact with the electorate.3.11 In the light of these criticisms we considered a number of aspects of party work and organisation where there appeared to be scope for possibleimprovement; in particular, research and the formulation of policy; staffing;accommodation; training and political education; and communication andparticipation by the electorate.
Research and the Formulation of policy.12 The word &quot;research&quot; was used frequently by witnesses in the catalogueof party needs. The main work of a party research organisation is not researchas generally understood in the academic and scientific world. It is rather thatof a secretariat servicing working parties, providing briefs and an informationservice, and keeping in touch with, and when necessary stimulating, researchdone elsewhere. The range of government activities is now so wide and socomplex that no party research department can possibly function properlyunless its own organisation matches the diversification of public administration.This entails a degree of expertise and specialisation more like that of a party&quot;civil service&quot; to back up policy committees, the Shadow Cabinet, liaisoncommittees and the rest of the network required in an efficient and modernpolitical party. The resources required for this purpose are, however, limited in relation to the total budget of a well staffed party headquarters. The Con-servative Party, and possibly the labour Party, are in a relatively good positionto provide the minimum requirements for this purpose. The Scottish NationalParty and Plaid Cymru have the advantage of concentrating their efforts inScotland and Wales where the distribution of population means that a high proportion of those who might contribute to voluntary research work are within relatively easy reach of their central offices. The liberal Party have been unable to assign enough staff to its policy department, but this is the resultnot of any special shortage of resources for research but of its general shortageof central income. We regard the question of provision for research, therefore,as essentially an aspect of the general adequacy or otherwise of parties&apos; centralincome. We do not overlook the external associated groups and individuals,inside and outside the universities, who are able to help on a voluntary basis.But there is a shortage of adequate support facilities for the analysis andinterpretation of the research done by these individuals and groups, and someparties may well have too few full-time staff of their own.3.13 It has been suggested that deficiencies in the parties&apos; research facilities are revealed when policies formulated in opposition prove to be impracticablein government. When this occurs the fault may not lie with the research staffso much as with the party&apos;s policy committee or even the party conference.Policy-making is &quot;politics&quot;, and the light of more and better research may not always shine through. There are perhaps as many examples of mistaken policiesbased upon careful preparation of a doctrinaire and inflexible approach as ofwoolly proposals with little solid research to support them. AH we can say isthat party politics are too important to be shaped and formulated withoutfully adequate research services, and mistakes are likely to be made if theseare lacking.Staffing3.14 We are bound to take notice of the evidence that emerged about the lack of resources available to parties for staffing the day-to-day running oftheir organisations. In our view it is not in the interests of maintaining, let alone expanding, the popular basis of democratic government in this country,for so many local constituency and regional organisations of the major partiesto be unable to support a single full-time paid official. Even the best placed
party in this respect, the Conservative Party, has a paid agent in only half ofthe constituencies. It is becoming increasingly difficult for parties to supportwhat paid agencies they have; as a consequence, the Conservative, Labour and liberal party agencies have all been reduced. There is also great difficulty in keeping up with rising salary rates in order to attract suitable candidates. Inthe Labour Party this has already got to the stage where very few appropriatelyqualified candidates are applying for full-time agency posts. It may well be thatjob-security is a vital consideration here; the present financial position of theparty is such that it is impossible to say how many full-time agents it will beable to afford over the next ten years. This is not a matter of minor importancerelated to a higher or lower level of party bureaucracy. Political parties, like allbodies of any size and range of responsibility, must have good organisation and management. If the parties are to maintain and improve their efficiency, it willbe necessary for them to find the resources with which to maintain adequatestaffs, properly remunerated. The aim should be to ensure that all parties are able to recruit sufficient agents and headquarter staff and give them reasonablejob security, adequate salaries and pensions.Accommodation3.15 The evidence we have taken, and our own observation, has confirmed that the typical office accommodation occupied by the parties is at best spartanand at worst inaccessible and depressing, with few amenities and maintainedonly to minimum standards. It is traditional in this country for parties to operate in such drab surroundings. Whether the electorate respect the partiesmore for these outward signs of financial stringency, or whether it leads tolow morale and lowered efficiency and drives away many who might otherwiseplay a valuable role in the country*s political life-must be a matter for con-jecture. It is indisputable, however, that no party in Britain can compare inaccommodation standards with, for example, the main political parties in west Germany.Training and Political Education3.16 The business of government at both national and local level is now more complex than ever. The powers, services and administration of government,both centrally and locally, come into the lives and homes of us all. social services, education, housing, land use, wages, industry, state enterprise, prices,municipal services, rents, rates, taxation, the interests and rights of the citizenand the impact of bureaucracy can all be regarded as &quot;politics&quot; and all partyworkers need to be informed about them. Local councillors, in particular,should be prepared in advance for the work they have to do by close andguided study of the scope and powers of local authorities. Although schools and seminars for members and prospective members of local coonals are becoming a very necessary form of training and education, the facilities in all political parties for education for both central and local government are becoming less and less adequate. This is regrettable because political education is a legitimate and important role for all parties in Britain, and we are concerned about the extent to which financial stringency may force them to abandoneven what they now provide.
Communication and Participation by the Electorate3.17 to spite of television, radio and the press, the party organisations still have an important role to play in informing the electorate about party policies,particularly in relation to local government matters where television and radioare much less dominant Moreover, the local party organisations are a valuablemeans of keeping party representatives constantly aware of the views andconcerns of their supporters.3.18 The role of the parties in communication is thus a complex process: fromthe parties to their members and to the public; and from the public and partymembers to the parties and to party headquarters. Some of our witnesses feltthat parties were failing in what might be expected of them in this field. Thisevidence was supported by our survey of public opinion (see Chapter 7). Theparties in the countries we visited laid emphasis on the amount of effort and money they devoted to improved communication, although it was difficult to assess how successful this had been.3.19 The agents from the Labour and Liberal parties saw a need to developparty communications with the public in the direction of local parties actingrather as citizens advice bureaux. Traditionally this role of citizens&apos; friend ismore frequently filled by the Member of Parliament or local Councillor offeringhis help and advice at &quot;surgeries&quot; to all who seek it, irrespective of partyaffiliation. In most European countries, partly because of their different electoralsystems (by no means all members of parliament have constituencies, and thosewho do normally have larger constituencies than their United Kingdom counter-parts), the &quot;constituency&quot; role of the member of parliament is not so highly developed towards help and advice to the individual citizen. By contrast, their political parties often play a much wider part in local community activity.People go to &quot;the party&quot; for a great deal more personal service than theyusually do here. The failure of the parties in Britain to satisfy the growing demand for participation and involvement in policy making may account forthe note of disappointment we heard from some witnesses.3.20 How far such trends as low political activity, low election turn-outs,and low attendances at political meetings, can be put down to failures ofcommunication is of course conjectural. It may well be that the causes are far more fundamental. Nevertheless, we believe that a positive attempt to improve the level of all communication between the parties and the public is an effort which is well worth making at the present time, and that bearing the Europeanevidence in mind, could be an important factor in raising the general level ofpolitical education, and in arresting, if not reversing, the current decline ofgeneral public participation in party activity. The dangers which can arise from our democratic procedures falling into the hands of a narrow andunrepresentative minority need not be emphasised.Former Tasks Ahead3.21 Independently of the scope for improvement in the carrying out of theirpresent functions, certain important additional tasks seem almost certain to beplaced upon the parties in the next few years. These are in connection with the
introduction of direct elections to the European Parliament and the establish-ment of national assemblies in Scotland and Wales. It is difficult at this stage to forecast the cost to the parties of participating in direct elections to theEuropean Parliament, but it seems likely at present that any aid that may beprovided by the e.c. would go towards the actual costs of election rather than to the parties, which in some European countries are already state-aided.The costs involved in elections to the Scottish and Welsh Assemblies would fallparticularly heavily on the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru. As regardselections to the European Parliament, the White Paper proposals envisage anentirely new geography of constituencies, smaller in number but vastly enlargedin the size of their electorates. Not only will the political parties have to selectcandidates and work for their election, but they will also have to have policies for Europe. Parties will presumably formulate policy documents and parrymanifestos for Brussels as well as for Westminster and will need for this purpose to maintain regular and expensive contacts with related parties elsewhere inEurope and with the European Community institutions. This will require anew dimension to party organisation and to party thinking.
THE PICTURE AT THE CENTREGeneral4.1 In this chapter we describe our conclusions about the state of the political parties at the centre. This means describing the &quot;national&quot; parties, as they aresometimes called the Labour Party with its headquarters in Transport House,the Conservative Party Organisation and the National Union of ConservativeAssociations in Smith Square, the Liberal Party at its headquarters in the Strand;and outside London, the Scottish Conservative Party, the Scottish liberal party and the Scottish National Party at their headquarters in Edinburgh;the Welsh Liberal Party and Plaid Cyraru in Cardiff.4.2 These national parties are all to be distinguished from their parties orassociations m the constituencies. Generally speaking, the constituency parties have separate and independent existences, although they are affiliated to thecentral party and many contribute to its upkeep. The national parties direct the overall national policy and affairs; they may also run and direct the regional offices; but at membership and community level they have to work through the constituency organisations. In particular, membership of a party is generallythrough the constituency organisation or through branches operating withinconstituency areas.Fhtancfal Structure4.3 The income of the central parties comes from a variety of sources. they include payments in the form of affiliation fees (see paragraph 4.17), &quot;quotas&quot;(see paragraph 5.44) sent in by the constituencies; contributions or affiliationfees from trade unions and other groups, such as women&apos;s and youth organis-ations; donations from individuals or corporate bodies; and a negligible amountfrom investment and property rents. Unlike the position in many continentalparties there is no income from commercial enterprises run by the parties them-selves. The proportion of central income from these different sources variesconsiderably from party to party.4.4 The parties at the centre spend their money in the main on headquartersadministration; on area or regional offices and constituency organisations;publicity; and on research and policy formulation. Until recently a considerableamount went on providing services for the parties in Parliament briefingparty spokesmen and providing research and support facilities but some ofthis burden has now been lifted by the annual grants to opposition parties inParliament (see paragraph 1.4).Financial State of the Parties at the Centre4.5 We sought from the parties returns of their central income and expendituresince 1967, broken down as far as possible into certain prescribed categories.In order to highlight trends these returns were then recast in terms of constant prices, namely in terms of 1970 prices. An account of the results, with graphs,is at Annex B. The main facts which emerged are summarised in the following
paragraphs. The figures quoted are actual figures as provided by the parties;where they have been based on 1970 prices this has been specifically indicated.4.6 The Conservative and Labour parties appear to be in the strongest financialposition, with annual incomes at the centre currently running at approximately 1-7 million (1975-76) and an estimated  1-2 million (1976) respectively.In addition, the Scottish Conservative Party has a current annual income ofabout  93,000 (1975). Since 1967 the Conservative Party has generally had alarger income than the Labour Party but, with an appreciable fall in real terms in Conservative Party income, the gap between the two parties has narrowed.4.7 The Liberal Party had a central income in 1975 of about  96,000* and theScottish and Welsh Liberal parties had incomes of about  14,000 and,  2,000respectively. The income of the Scottish National Party is estimated to beabout  61,000 in 1976 and Plaid Cymru expects its 1976 centra! income to be 85,000. The Co-operative Party&apos;s central income in 1975 was  105,000 andthe Communist Party had an average annual income of  88,000 during thetwo-year period 1973-74.4.8 Overall, the pattern of central party incomes over the period does notappear to indicate any fundamental change except in so far as levels of income and expenditure have reached their peak in general election years. allowing for the impact of general elections, the level of central party incomes appearsto have remained relatively stable in real terms.4.9 The central reserves of the parties however are falling (see Annex B).Although this may be partially attributable to fluctuations in the value ofinvestments and property, it seems clear that the parties now have considerably less in reserve than a few years ago. This fail has occurred most severely in thecase of the Conservative and Co-operative parties. It will also be noticed thatthe Liberal Party has a substantial deficit. The Labour Party reserves are at a particularly low level, and have been failing steadily in real terms since 1970.In 1975 they stood at  419,000 compared with a level of  774,000 in 1968;in real terms (ie at 1970 prices) they fell from  870,000 in 1968 to  190,000 in1975.Income4.10 There were considerable variations in the sources of income receivedcentrally by the parties. In the case of the Conservative Party,  1,137,000 ofthe partis total central income of  1,739,000 for the year ending 31 March 1976came from donations;  574,000 from constituency payments (including&quot;quotas&quot;); and  28,000 (net) from investments. The party*s main source of central income throughout the period examined has been donations from indi-viduals and corporate bodies. These have tended to rise when general electionshave been imminent, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of total income. There is some indication that, general elections apart, company*The Liberal Party figures for 1975 are provisional.
donations arc not keeping pace with inflation. &quot;Quotas&quot; (see paragraph 5.44)paid from the constituencies to the central party, and which include a subscriptionelement, form a substantial part of central party income.4.11 The Labour Party estimate their 1976 central income at  1,211,000, ofwhich  1,150,000 would come from subscriptions, including principally tradeunion affiliation fees;  51,000 from donations, appeals etc; and  10,000 frominvestment income. Subscriptions and union affiliation fees could account for95 % of the party&apos;s central income in 1976. The extra income received by theparty in election years usually comes from increases in donations, and in generalelection years a special fund is normally established. The 1974 fund raised 915,000.4.12 The latest income figures from the Liberal Party were for 1975. Theseprovisional figures showed a total income of  96,000 but no breakdown is available. Subscription income fell significantly in 1970. This has since levelledout, but even now it constitutes only a minor element in central party income.Virtually all the increases in central party income received in the electionyears of 1970 and 1974 came from gifts and donations from sources other thanconstituency parties. The Scottish Liberals receive just under half their income in the form of subscriptions. The main source of income for the Welsh liberal party is donations, other than those from constituency parties.4.13 Of the Scottish National Party&apos;s estimated central income of  61,000about two-thirds comes from membership subscriptions. This element hasprogressively risen over the period. Three-quarters of Plaid Cymru&apos;s total income is derived from donations other than those from the constituencyparties, and from miscellaneous sources, including the sale of literature.4.14 The Co-operative Party had a total central income in 1975 of about 105,000, of which by far the largest element (88 %) was derived from affiliatedsocieties. Donations are received mainly in election years. Donations accountedfor about one-half of the Communist Party*s average annual income of  88,000in the period 1973-74.Support from Trade Unions and Companies4.15 It may be helpful here to give an account of the statutory provisionsunder which financial help is given to the Labour Party by the trade unions,and company donations are made to the Conservative and other parties.4.16 The statutory provision under which the trade unions contribute to labour Party funds is the Trades Union Act 1913. Under this provision anyunion wishing to use funds for&quot;political objects&quot;has first to obtain the approval,by ballot, of its members. Secondly, rules have to be made setting up a separatepolitical fund which are approved by the Registrar of Friendly Societies. Therules must include a provision for &quot;contracting out&quot; ie for a member to be exempted from paying a political fund contribution, The Industrial relations act 1971 transferred functions under the 1913 Act from the Registrar of friendly Societies to the Registrar of Trade Unions and Employers Associations.
Unions with political funds were to furnish returns to this Registrar. Under theTrade Unions and Labour Relations Act 1974 the 1971 Act was repealed, andall trade unions, whether registered or not, were required to make an annualreturn covering the political fund where this is set up. Returns are available for inspection at the Office of the Registrar of Friendly Societies. All trade unionswhich sponsor parliamentary candidates have political funds.4.17 Most trade unions with political funds pay affiliation fees to the LabourParty at constituency and national level. The fees payable to the nationalparty are currently based on 21p a year for each affiliated contributor to a union political fund. The number of votes each union is entitled to record at theLabour Party&apos;s Annual Conference is based on the number of its affiliatedmembers.4.18 Some trade unions also use their political funds for sponsoring parlia-mentary candidates. At the October 1974 General Election 143 candidateswere sponsored in this way-details are given in Annex C. Under existingLabour Party rules, however, a union or any other affiliated organisation cannotcontribute to the election expenses of a candidate a sum in excess of 80% ofthe maximum expenses allowed by law. Moreover, the sponsoring organisation has to undertake to limit its contributions to the funds of a constituency Labourparty to  350 a year in a borough constituency or  420 a year in a countyconstituency. Where a full-time agent is employed, however, the organisaion may contribute up to 60% of the agreed salary scale for agents in a boroughconstituency or 65% in a county constituency.4.19 Many donations come to the Conservative Party from companies, either directly or through organisations such as the British United Industrialists or the regional Industrial Councils. The Companies Act 1967, Section 19 requires a company in Great Britain to declare in its accounts any money given for political purposes if it exceeds  50, the name of the person to whom the moneyhas been given, the identity of the party and the amount of money given. this requirement applies if the money is given for political purposes directly or indirectly.Expenditure4.20 We asked for details of the parties&apos; total central expenditure, analysedin two different ways:A. Headquarters administration; area and regional services includinggrants to constituency parties; publicity, press relations and broadcast-ing; research and policy formulation; other expenditure.B. Salaries and wages; printing, postage, telephones and stationery;rent, equipment and office services; travelling, conference etc. expenses;fees to consultants, agencies etc. for public opinion research, public relations and advertising etc; other expenditure.It was not possible to ensure that each party interpreted these categories ofexpenditure in precisely the same way; nor are the accounts of the partiesstrictly comparable. We considered, therefore, that it would be unwise to
attempt a comparison of the relative proportionate expenditure spent on eachcategory by the various parties. The value of any such comparative analysisis also limited by the fact that the Conservative Party were able to apportiontheir expenditure in category B above only between salaries and wages andother expenditure.Expenditure analysis A4.21 The Labour Party&apos;s estimate of central party expenditure for 1976 was 1,280,000. Of this, regional, area and headquarters&apos; services were expectedto account for about 90%. The amount spent by the Labour Party on head-quarters&apos; administration has increased in real terms since 1967, perhaps withthe introduction of the Labour Party&apos;s newspaper Labour Weekly, for whichextra staff had to be employed. The estimate of the amount to be spent onpublicity, press relations and broadcasting in 1976 was  64,000. This item hasincreased markedly in general election years; for example, by a special additionof  174,000 in 1974. As with other parties, the amount spent on research and policy formulation (estimated for 1976 at  82,000) has remained fairly static,in real terms, since 1967.4.22 The Conservative Party&apos;s total expenditure for 1975-76 was  1,724,000.Of this, the largest element arose from expenses in headquarters and area/regional administration. The amount spent on publicity, press relations and broadcasting has fluctuated considerably over the past nine years, with very heavy expenditure in general election years, for example  931,000 in 1974-75.The amount spent on research and policy formulation has fallen, in real terms,over the period although remaining at around 12% of total central partyexpenditure.4.23 The figures of expenditure by the other parties over recent years illustrate the amount that has to be spent by any party, regardless of its size, on its headquarters administration. The Liberal Party has consistently spent a very high proportion of its income on headquarters administration, but the amountspent on area and regional services has fluctuated. In 1974 expenditure on bothheadquarters and area services increased considerably. The Scottish NationalParty spent hardly anything from their central funds on area services, but itestimates that in 1976 it will allocate over two-thirds of the party&apos;s total ex-penditure to headquarters administration.4.24 The cost of research and policy formulation normally formed a high proportion of Liberal Party expenditure. This may account for the emphasisplaced by the Liberals in their evidence on financing research from state aid.It must be remembered, however, that the parties&apos; accounts do not include the research carried on by bodies independent of the parties&apos; central headquarters and separately financed: for example the Fabian Society, the Bow Group, andthe Centre for Political Studies.Expenditure analysis B4.25 Political parties are labour-intensive. The analysis of party expenditure under the second set of headings emphasised the high proportion of partyexpenditure that goes on salaries and wages. The Conservative Partyin 1975-76
spent  1,231,000 (71 %) on salaries and wages out of a total expenditure of 1,724,000. The Labour Party allocated about 60% of their 1975 income tosalaries and wages. The Liberals normally Bpend about half their income onsalaries as do the other parties, with the exception of Plaid Cymru who spendonly about one-third of their income on salaries.4.26 As a general point, it should be emphasised that the high proportion of party expenditure spent on salaries is not a reflection of high salaries. the remuneration of party workers in the central organisations is generally admitted to be low in relation to comparable employment elsewhere.
THE PICTURE IN THE CONSTITUENCIESGeneralS.1 The picture presented to the Committee of the state of political partiesat constituency level is a variable one but some broad outlines are clear. TheConservative associations on the whole are better off, better staffed and betterhoused than those of any other party. The Labour parties exist on lowerstandards of accommodation and equipment and have smaller resources. the liberals and Nationalists are the poorest in material terms.5.2 By comparison with what we gathered of some other European parties,accommodation and staffing at local levels here are distinctly unfavourable.It seems to be traditional for British parties to operate on the austerity standardscommonly found in voluntary organisations.5.3 The paid agents of all parties were fully conscious of the shortcomingsof local organisation. Support for state aid came from paid field workers in the major parties; about half of the Conservative agents expressed, with somereservations, sympathy with the idea of a public subsidy for political parties.5.4 The Labour and Liberal agents strongly supported state aid. They con-sidered that agents of good calibre will become increasingly difficult to recruitat present salary levels, and that too much of their time is now being spent onraising money and too little as the party&apos;? political representative.5.5 Low party membership is frequently a feature in the constituencies, peoplecan now see and identify with party leaders on television or listen to them onradio. Large public meetings and rallies organised by local parties are rarelyheld. Politically interested people do not have, as in former years, to become members to learn about the ideology and the policies of the party. nevertheless the local parties still have important tasks. They must communicate policies in local terms. They must organise and fight the elections which put particularleaders and policies into power. And they must choose the candidates for parliament. Generally speaking, only through local parties can anyone gain aseat in the House of Commons or become a Minister. This picture is evenmore true today than a century ago, when there was a higher proportion of independent Members. Today an aspiring politician has to be a member of alocal party. Thus it is important that the local party should be responsible andmature in its choice. Ail parties must bear in mind the importance of keeping the local organisations strong, independent, representative of their community and politically active. They carry a heavy responsibility for presenting to theircommunity the objectives and policies of the party in an informed and democraticmanner.5.6 There was unanimity among all our witnesses on the importance of theparties at constituency level; but remarkably little detailed knowledge ofconstituency finance. The various national headquarters could guess at the total
income of their constituency organisations, and they could give us estimates of probable membership, and the proportion of income spent on salaries and wages. But they could not give us any firm figures, much less any detailed break-down, of sources of income or items of expenditure. A number of studies havebeen carried out by political scientists on constituency finances and activities,generally confined to Conservative and Labour organisations. We found these studies useful. Nevertheless, we felt that overall we lacked sufficient information on the present position of constituency organisations.5.7 We therefore carried out a survey, covering 100 constituencies in GreatBritain, of all local parties who put forward candidates in those constituencies in the October 1974 General Election. The basis on which the 100 constituencieswere chosen is given in Annex D. The survey was restricted to a number of keyquestions, and carried out by means of a postal questionnaire followed -by telephone enquiries where necessary. Details of income andexpenditure requestedwere confined to 1973 and 1974.5.8 The findings of the survey were used, together with evidence from theparties&apos; agents and other witnesses, and with published studies, to build up a picture of the main parties at local level. The other parties and the independentcandidates whom we also contacted were not able to provide us with the requiredinformation. Research Surveys of Great Britain Ltd, were commissioned to codeand analyse the returns from the Conservative, Labour and Liberal parties.Their report is at Annex E. Annex F is a supplementary paper by the central statistical Office on marginal constituencies. The following paragraphs dealmainly with the results of this survey.Membership5.9 Membership of political parties is not easily defined. Most parties do not always collect subscriptions regularly, and they may continue to regard as members people who have not kept up their subscriptions, or who are knownsupporters and have worked for the party without ever paying subscriptions.The Labour Party&apos;s figure of some 892,000 is clearly an overestimate, because it is based on rules which require local constituency parties to join the centralparty on a minimum of 1,000 members. The Liberals stated that membershipwas still under the 1964-5 peak of 250,000. The Conservatives gave no figures.5.10 We tried to keep the estimates as realistic as possible by asking for thenumber of individual subscription-paying members. About one-half of the localorganisations replying said they had less than 500 members. The averagememberships in 1974 for the constituency parties were approximately: Con-servative 2,400, Labour 500 and Liberal 300.5.11 Membership was thus much lower in the Labour parties than in theConservative associations. Most of the Labour parties had under 1,000 individual -dual members, and none had over 2,000; of the Conservative associations over half claimed over 1,000 members and one-third over 3,000. The Liberals had developed a large number of organisations between 1972 and 1974, but most oftheir organisations still had under 500 members in 1975.
5.12 There was little indication of what caused large or small membership.The presence of a paid agent was generally associated with large membership,but it was impossible to say which was cause and which effect. A large member-ship can be a financial burden to a local party because of the costs of the paperwork and circulation of party material to members who may take no active part in constituency affairs. From another standpoint, however, a large member-ship can compensate for such drawbacks by providing a ready supply of volun-tary workers for fund-raising activities.Branches5.13 Most constituency parties have branch or ward organisations, oftencorresponding to local government electoral divisions. These smaller organisa-tions often have considerable independence; they are manned by volunteerworkers; they have their own income and expenditure and may supply most ofthe money and the party workers for local government election campaigns.5.14 The survey showed that nearly all the Labour and Conservative parties had branch organisations. The Conservatives tended to have many more thanthe others and to receive more money from them. It was perhaps a sign of weakness in the Liberal associations that some 14% did not have branches.This may have been due to the recent formation of many of the associations.Staffing5.15 Three-fifths of the 240 constituency organisations providing information had no paid officers. Only one-quarter had a full-time paid agent, and only afurther eighth had a part-time or shared agent. Thus most local parties dependon voluntary help to maintain party organisation.5.16 The survey findings, and the evidence from the central parties, bothshowed that the Conservative associations were far better staffed than thoseof other parties. Over half of them have a full-time paid agent, and a furtherquarter a part-time or shared one. Thus only one-quarter of the Conservativeassociations were without a paid full-time, part-time or shared agent, comparedwith three-quarters of the Labour constituency parties and 90 % of the Liberalassociations.5.17 In recent years the Labour Party have introduced a scheme whereby the central party pays the salaries of some of the agents while the constituencyparties concerned make contributions of varying amounts to the central partyto assist in meeting the cost involved. The objective of this innovation is tocreate a national agency network, and to remove insecurity and fay the basisof a career structure for paid party workers. The scheme appears, however,to have met with only qualified success, mainly because the entire party haslacked sufficient funds to pay adequate salaries and to extend the number of constituencies involved (at present only some thirty, or one-third, of the LabourParty agents are in this scheme). The remaining two-thirds of the agents are paid directly by the constituency parties; in a few cases the central party may give a small grant-in-aid.32TTTV
5.18 The great majority of Conservative agents are employed by local con-stituency associations, who pay their salaries and expenses. The associationsalso make an annual &quot;quota&quot; payment to Central Office. The remainingconstituency agents are at present employed centrally in a Central EmploymentScheme. A Central Employment Board pays their salaries, but the individualassociations for whom the agents work pay their expenses. These constituenciesalso reimburse the Board with, as near as they can afford, the gross cost of theiragents&apos; salaries, as well as making the normal &quot;quota&quot; contributions. It has beenfound, however, that most constituencies prefer to employ their own agents,and to be responsible for raising the money involved. The decision has therefore been taken to end the Central Employment Scheme, and those agents previouslycentrally employed are now being negotiated back into the employment of their constituencies.5.19 Generally speaking, there were even fewer supporting paid staff thanagents, and most of these were in the Conservative associations. Two-thirds of the Conservative associations with full-time agents also had another full-timeofficial, generally a typist or secretary. Only in four organisations was morethan one additional worker employed. Such support for agents was much lessmarked in the Labour parties, who tended to employ part-time or shared staff.The practice of paying subscription or donation collectors was confined tosome 5% of constituency organisations.Acconunofatton5.20 Nearly all Conservative associations had the use of an office, eitherrented, owned, or shared, whereas two-fifths of the Labour and three-quarters of the Liberal organisations did not have the use of an office. As might beexpected, organisations that have paid agents normally own or have the use ofan office.Local Government Elections5.21 We had been told in evidence that local government elections were becoming increasingly parry-political; more candidates belonged to political parties, and more councillors were members of party groups. We could nottest such tendencies in the survey, but asked about the amount of party activity in the last full round of local government elections. These elections ware some-whfit unusual since they were the first for the new reorganised local governmentauthorities in England, Wales and Scotland. The only &quot;regular&quot; elections were those for the London Boroughs of 1974. It will be seen from Table B in para-graph 2.63 of Annex E that there was a high party political involvement inthe elections. About 80% of Conservative and Labour parties, compared with less than 50% of Liberal parties, put forward candidates in at least half theseats in their area.Financial Situation5.22 We found it difficult to assess the financial situation of the constituencyorganisations, and we are grateful to the many party officers who filled in thispart of the questionnaire. It was not always easy, however, for them to provide
information, in the categories we requested. The figures supplied to us, therefore,whilst valuable as an indication of the relative importance of the varioussources of income and areas of expenditure, must be treated with some caution.S.23 The average income and expenditure of the constituency organisationsin the two years under review is shown in the Table in paragraph 3.2.6 of annex E. The table also indicates the differences associated with the presenceof a full-time agent5.24 The Conservative associations had approximately twice as large a financial turnover as Labour parties, and Labour parties approximately twiceas much as Liberal parties. All income and expenditure increased considerably in 1974, a year with two general elections; and although the estimated 1975cash levels were above those of 1973, in real terms they were lower. It mustbe remembered, however, that a large number of local government electionstook place in England and Wales during 1973. This may have made the 1973cash levels higher than would be normal in a non-general election year.5.25 There was a considerable range in income and expenditure for the three parties. These are shown in the Tables in paragraph 3.3.2 of Annex E.5.26 The presence of a full-time paid agent was associated with organisationsin the higher income ranges. In 1974 none of the 55 constituency organisationsin the sample which had an agent received less than  1,000, and only onereceived less than  2,000. Most of them had an income of over  5,000. even so, the difference between Labour and Conservative organisations remained.A Labour party with an agent had, on average, more money than one without an agent, but still had less than the average income of a Conservative associationwithout an agent. Again, the survey cannot show cause and effect. From ourown experience we would say that agents increased the income of constituencyorganisations, and that richer organisations tend to employ agents.Financial position of branches and wards5.27 To round off the picture we needed some idea of income and expenditurein the party groupings below constituency level. Branches and wards have theirown income and expenditure. We could not in the time available enquireclosely into these smaller groups. Although some of the returns includedbranch or ward turnover in their general income and expenditure, most didnot. The constituency parties themselves often do not know the financialposition of their branches or wards. Accordingly we had to rely on estimates of the separate financial positions of these bodies. Twenty-three organisationsgave estimates of the income and expenditure of their branches and wards:these averaged about  600. Sixty-six gave estimates of their working funds:these averaged about  400.Sources of heal party income5.28 The Labour parties draw most of their income from lotteries, sub-prescriptions, social functions, trade union and Co-operative Party grants. TheConservative associations rely mainly on branch quotas, social functions,
subscriptions and lotteries. The Liberals depend mainly on social functions,ward or branch grants, individual donations, headquarters&apos; grants and sub-prescriptions. For those Liberal organisations which had a grant from headquarters,the grant is the biggest single source of income. Conservative associations witha full-time paid agent have higher income from most sources. In the Labourparties the presence of a full-time paid agent coincided with a greater incidence of grams from trade unions and the Co-operative Party.5.29 The 1974 general elections caused some changes in income patterns.There were special general election appeals and, in the case of the labour organisations, grants from headquarters were increased.Individual membership fees5.30 These are at present annually:-Communist   3 for employed members; 60p for housewivesand unemployedConservatives  varies according to local organisations: butthe average is probably around 25pCo-operative -30pLabour - 1-20Liberal - 1Plaid Cymru  30p for adultsScottish National Party - 1By European standards these are undoubtedly low. In the countries we visitedannual subscriptions are much higher, and generally graded according toincome. In The Netherlands they may vary from  2 to  25 according to income.In Germany the minimum is about  5 but members are expected to pay moreaccording to income. In Austria the minimum is about  4.5.31 Membership subscriptions represented some 12% of total income forthe Labour parties in 1973 and 7% in 1974. They accounted for 16% and 11 %of income for Conservative parties and 8 % and 3 % for Liberal parties.Institutional donations5.32 Labour parties received about 11 % of their income in 1973 from tradeunion donations and grants from trade unions and the Co-operative Party inrespect of sponsored candidates. In 1974 this increased to 19%. Conservativeassociations received about 5% of their income from company donations in1973 and 6% in 1974.Social events5 33 Bazaars, jumble sales and social functions are traditional money-raisingmethods used by most parties. Conservative constituency parties appear toraise on average at least about  900 annually from these sources, representingsome 18% of total income in 1973 and 12% in 1974; Labour parties raisedabout  150 in 1973 (8% of income) and  180 (5%) in 1974; and Liberal partiesjust under  300 in both years (28 % of income in 1973 and 13% in 1974).
Lotteries5.34 A fairly high proportion of some parties&apos; constituency income comes from lotteries, football pooh etc. Local Labour parties raise on average about 700 from this source, representing some 39% of their income in 1973 and20% in 1974; Liberal parties raised  70 (7%) in 1973 and  170 (8%) in 1974.expenditure .35 All organisations, whether or not they have an agent, spent most oftheir money on salaries and wages, office administration, rents and rates.These items together accounted in the survey for 50% of Liberal expenditure,57% of Labour expenditure and 88% of Conservative expenditure.5.36 The survey showed that some 5-7% of expenditure went on affiliationfees and &quot;quotas&quot; to the central parties, but the returns of income and expendi-ture received from Conservative Central Office suggest that this may be onthe low side, at least so far as Conservative associations are concerned.5.37 The proportion of income going on local government elections was highfor the Liberal organisations (25%), lower for Labour (18%) and lowest of all for the Conservatives (7%). In absolute terms, however, the order is reversedwith, in 1973, average local government election expenses for the Conservativeassociations of  382, Labour parties  331 and Liberal parties  200.Trade union backing5.38 Some of the Labour parties had Members of Parliament or candidatessponsored by trade unions and by the Co-operative Party.5.39 If a constituency party selects as its candidate a nominee of a tradeunion, the union may give an annual grant of up to  350 (for boroughs) and 420 (for counties) towards the constituency expenses, or where there is afull-time agent, may pay up to 60% of the salary of the agent in a boroughconstituency and up to 65% in a county constituency; and up to 80% of theexpenses of the general election, together with grants for the maintenanceof the candidate if elected. The amount of help a constituency party gets froma trade union varies considerably within these limits. Some trade unions also give grants to candidates who, although not sponsored, are members of thetrade union. The arrangements are similar for the Co-operative Party, but,by agreement, not more than 30 candidates sponsored by the Co-operativeParty may be selected by constituency Labour parties. Annex C shows thenumber of candidates sponsored by trade unions at the October 1974 GeneralElection.5.40 Financially there were obvious differences between the two groups.The &quot;sponsored&quot; parties tended to receive less from individual donations and social functions. This suggests a lower level of activity in, fund-raising fromindividuals by such constituency parties; as against that, however, the amountfrom wards and branches was greater for 1973, though not for 1974, andmembership subscriptions about the same. Trade union donations were much
more important. Sponsored parties were generally also far less dependenton grants from party headquarters, as one would expect with the alternativesource of income.5.41 Sponsored parties tended to spend about the same as, or more than, thenon-sponsored parties on most items. Expenditure was much greater (by aboutli times) on salaries and rent/rates.5.42 Generally speaking, sponsored parties both received and spent morethan non-sponsored parties, but the difference was wholly or more than accoun-ted for by the grants from the sponsors. It cannot be said, therefore, that the assurance of a basic minimum sum by way of grants increased the money-raising activities of the organisations. Sponsored parties were more likely tohave full-time agents than non-sponsored parties.5.43 Trade union or Co-operative Party sponsorship seemed to be unrelatedto the number of members in a constituency party. The average membershipfor sponsored parties (450 in 1973) is not significantly different from the averagemembership for non-sponsored parties (470 in 1973). Similarly, the amountraised by membership subscriptions is about the same. There was also nodiscernible difference in satisfaction with the level of membership.Financial links with headquarters5.44 There is a considerable flow of money both ways between national partyheadquarters and the constituencies. Constituency organisations in mostparties pass to headquarters a proportion of their income from subscriptionsor other activities. In the Labour Party, constituency parties affiliate to thenational party on a basis of 21p per constituency member per year, with aminimum of 1,000 members. They may also make grants to the headquartersover and above that sum, perhaps for special or general election appeals.Conservative constituency associations agree with the headquarters a &quot;quota&quot;&apos;that they will pay each year. This is not based on the number of members,but on a formula reflecting Conservative voting strength in the constituency.5.45 Similarly the national headquarters pay out money to constituencyorganisations. In all parties such grants tend to go to the financially weakerconstituency organisations; and, more particularly when a general electionis inmiinent, to organisations in marginal constituencies. Some headquarters&apos;money also goes in financing the salaries of the agents.5.46 In terms of the total &quot;quotas&quot; from associations and total headquartersgrants, there was fairly substantial and constant financial support from theConservative associations for their national headquarters; the Liberal organisa-tions in total, gave as much as they received in 1973, and received from head-quarters about double the amount they gave in fees to headquarters in 1974.In 1973 the Labour parties overall paid out to headquarters more than they received from headquarters: in 1974, however, the position was reversed.Over half the Labour organisations received grants in 1974, compared with one-fifth of the Conservative associations and one-quarter of the Liberals.
5.47 The survey also showed that marginal constituencies were more likelyto be the recipients of a headquarters grant, and that the grants themselves were slightly larger in such constituencies.5.48 The survey again confirmed what is generally known about the financial situation of the Conservative and Labour parties, in relation to the size of majority in the constituency. Generally constituency parties with little hope of returning a Member had the lowest income and expenditure. The Conservativeassociations in safe Conservative seats had the highest income and expenditure;but Labour constituency parties had the highest income and expenditure in the marginal seats. The same broad pattern emerged for membership and theproportion of full-time paid agents. Labour parties tend to have highest member-ships and the highest proportion of full-time paid agents in their marginal seatswhile for the Conservative associations this is true of the safe seats.Nationalist parties5.49 The financial position of the Scottish National Party and of Plaid Cymruwas analysed separately. The smalt number of replies received 5 from theScottish National Party and 4 from Plaid Cymru-Inevitably limited the valueof the results.The Scottish National Party5.50 Financially the Scottish National Party constituency organisations seemedcomparatively poor by general United Kingdom standards. The small number of parties covered made it difficult to form a general view of the average amountof their incomes or expenditure. Most income appeared to come, however,from individual donations, membership subscriptions, and grants from branches.There were no paid full-time or part-time agents. Money was spent chiefly onoffice administration, rents and rates, but there was a high election expenditurein 1974 because of the two general elections and the elections for the newScottish local authorities. Assets were low.5.51 There was roughly the same range of membership as for the UnitedKingdom parties; three associations had under 1,000 members and two hadbetween 1,000 and 3,000. It may be noted that branches are obliged to forwardone-half of the membership subscription to central party funds.Plaid Cymru5.52 The income of the Plaid Cymru parties from which replies were receivedwas drawn from subscriptions, grants from branches, and grants from head-quarters. Money went chiefly on local government elections in 1973 and thegeneral elections in 1974.Are Constituency Parties in Financial Difficulties?5.53 Constituency parties were asked if they thought their party was experienc-ing serious, moderate, minor, or no financial difficulty. In reply most organisa-tions said that they were in serious or moderate financial difficulties; one inten reported minor difficulties, and few said that they had no financial difficulties.
Conservative associations generally appeared to be a little less likely than others to be experiencing financial difficulties. There was no clear indication thatorganisations having a paid agent were either more or less likely to feel theywere in financial difficulty. In response to a list of possible areas of economy,the most common areas of expenditure being cut back reported by organisationsin any degree of financial difficulty were communications, local election expenses, and conference delegates&apos; expenses. Cutting down on staff salarieswas the least common.5.54 Parties were also asked how much additional income they thoughtwould be necessary &quot;to discharge their functions in an efficient and economicalmanner&quot;. Answers ranged from nil to over  10,000 a year. Labour constituencyparties apparently had the lowest level of additional requirements; half saidthat their minimum needs would be satisfied with less than  1,000 additionalincome. Only a quarter of Conservative organisations matched this estimateof need, most of them estimating their requirements at between  2,000 and 5,000. Some 41 % of the Liberal associations considered they needed less than 1,000 additional income a year; but most of them would prefer between  1,000and  5,000. It may be, however, that many parties were reconciled to beingwithout an agent and limited their estimates of additional income accordingly.5.55 The Scottish National Party associations were relatively happy withtheir financial situation. Two associations claimed to have no financial problems,and two were experiencing only minor difficulties. Of the latter, one waslimiting expenditure on premises and advertising. Only one was experiencingserious financial difficulty and would be cutting expenditure on all items butparticularly on communications, leaflets and delegates to conferences.
TOTAL OVERALL INCOME OF THE PARTIES6.1 Any attempt to determine the overall income of the political partiesat the present time can only be an approximation. As indicated at Chapter 4,the income of the parlies at the centre can be established with reasonableaccuracy, although note has to be taken of the marked upturns of income ingeneral election years and the setting up of election funds. The overall income of the constituency parties is, however, far more difficult to ascertain.6.2 As stated in paragraph 5.6, there is generally no central record kept bythe parties of constituency party incomes and, short of making detailed enquiriesof all constituency parties, there is no way of getting to know with accuracywhat their total income amounts to. Furthermore, because there are no reliablerecords of overall party membership, it is not possible to make any reliableestimate of total constituency incomes from individual subscriptions. Theproblem of computing total party incomes is further complicated by therisk of double counting that income which goes either from the constituenciesto the central party organisations, or from the central party organisations tothe constituencies. For example, we find that in a general election year anaverage Labour constituency party might well get a grant of  300 or so fromheadquarters, but might also pay out to headquarters some  160 in affiliationfees. Despite these inevitable uncertainties, however, we considered it necessary at least to attempt some estimate of total constituency party income, and thereby an estimate of the overall income of the parties at the present time.63 It was necessary to use for this purpose the results of the constituencysurvey covering 100 constituencies, described at Chapter 5. The aim was tomake the sample as representative a cross-section of constituencies as possible.But it must be recognised that because of the wide discrepancies in constituencyincomes between different parts of the country, and between different types of constituency, the incomes of individual constituencies may in practicediffer very widely from the average incomes as indicated by the survey. the returns of income on which the surveys estimates of average constituencyincomes were based came from 73 Conservative associations, 75 Labour parties and 37 Liberal parties.6.4 The constituency survey covered two calendar years, 1973 and 1974.1974was, of course, an exceptional year because of the two genera] elections. Inorder to arrive at a more representative figure, and on the basis that there were likely to be three non-election years to one general election year, we trebledthe 1973 average constituency income figures, added the 1974 figures, andthen divided the result by four to arrive at our estimate of annual constituencyincomes. These figures have been expressed in terms of 1975 prices. Generalelection funds have been included but, in order to avoid the double countingof constituency and headquarters income, payments to and from party head-quarters have been discounted. For the purpose of estimating the constituencyincomes of the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru we have assumed thatthese are broadly in line with those of the Liberal Party organisations.
6.5 On the foregoing basis we have arrived at the following estimates of current annual income for the main parties.	Central	Constituency Incomes	Party	Incomes	(at 1975 prices)	Total	 	 	 Conservative (including Scottish)	1,790/100	4,500.000	6,290,000Labour	1,200,000	1,750,000	2,950,000Liberal (including Scottish and			Welsh)	113,000	750.000	863,000Scottish National Party	60,0001				160,000	305,000Plaid Cymru	85,000 j		Total	3,248,000	7,160,000	10,408.0006.6 It is emphasised that the above figures are necessarily based on certain general assumptions. In so far as the figures of central party incomes relate toa non-election year, it can be assumed, however, that the overall figures for totalparty incomes are, if anything, an underestimate.
WHAT THE PUBLIC THINKSIntroduction7.1 We considered it to be essential to our enquiry to find out how the publicsaw the position of political parties in a parliamentary democracy, and how they might react to the proposal that state aid should be given to the parties.7.2 We accordingly commissioned Research Surveys of Great Britain Limitedto carry out a public opinion survey on our behalf. This survey was based oninterviews with a representative sample of over 2,000 electors drawn at randomfrom a representative sample of 105 constituencies in Great Britain. Theinterviews took place in December 1975 and January 1976. The results of the survey are at Annex G. A copy of the survey report and the full tabulations willbe sent to the Social Science Research Council Data Archive at Essex University.The following paragraphs summarise the main findings.7.3 The survey confirmed that people in this country clearly accept that political parties, with all their faults, are essential to the running of our democracy.Whilst it is recognised that the parties need adequate financial resources toenable them to carry out their functions effectively, people are not generallyaware that parties are short of money. On the central issue of whether, on theassumption that parties are in need of money, state financial aid should beprovided, public opinion was evenly divided (see paragraph 7.22).Knowledge of Political Parties7.4 It was important to ascertain how much the general public knew aboutpolitical parties. From this information the Committee was able to judge whatvalue to place on the opinions expressed in the survey on the parties&apos; need for more money; and to assess the public reputation of political parties.7.5 The respondents were asked which parties they considered the mainones in national and local government The Labour and Conservative parties were mentioned most frequently (over 80% each for national government,and 65% and 55% respectively for local government). The Liberals were re-garded by only 42 % as a main party in national government and by only 22 %in respect of local government. In Scotland over a quarter of the respondentsmentioned the Scottish National Party as a main party in national governmentand nearly one-fifth in local government 16% in Wales mentioned PlaidCymru for national government and 17% for local government.7.6 People were asked in an open question what the parties did. For national government 29% of the sample mentioned the parties as running or governing the country and another 11% as deciding and carrying out policies. 11%referred to the parties&apos; role in looking after individuals.
7.7 As regards local government, 23% of the sample felt that parties hadan interest in local affairs and running the community, 18% mentioned specificservices such as police, education, health and housing. 9% felt that the partieseither did nothing or &quot;made a mess of things&quot;. The proportion of &quot;don&apos;t knows&quot;and &quot;no answers&quot; was nearly a quarter of the sample.7.8 Respondents were asked for their views on which people or organisationswere important in deciding what political parties do and what policies theyfollow. For the Labour Party about one-third mentioned the Prime Ministerand Ministers, whereas only 10% mentioned back-bench Members of Parlia-ment. 40% mentioned trade unions compared with only 6% who referred tolocal party workers and 3% mentioning the party conference. For the Con-servative Party, 35% and 27% mentioned the Leader of the Opposition and opposition spokesmen; 15% mentioned back-benchers; just over one-fifthmentioned companies.7.9 People were much less certain about who determined policy in the Liberaland Nationalist parties. 43% of the sample were unable to give an answer.The largest single mention was of the party leadership (29% of respondents)followed by Members of Parliament (18 %) and local party workers (11 %).General Attitudes to Political Parties7.10 Having ascertained what people thought parties actually did, respondentswere then asked what they thought the parties should do. In contrast to the open question used for what the parties did, this time they were asked to choose from a number of possible activities. Nearly everyone agreed that parties should explain their policies to the public. Most felt that the parties should help to decide government policies. 77% thought the parties should encouragepeople to vote in elections and 71 % said that they should provide a governmentteam. On the other hand, only just over half thought that the parties should&quot;organise MPs in the House of Commons&quot; or choose parliamentary candidates.7.11 There was general agreement that parties were essential to our formof national government; that the parties &quot;kept the government on its toes&quot;;and were the only way to represent the public*s views.7.12 Some unfavourable views of parties were expressed. Two-thirds agreed with the view that parties opposed each other &quot;for the sake of it&quot;, and halfagreed that they were not necessary in local politics. People with a higherthan average political interest tended to be more favourably disposed towardspolitical parties.7.13 We found strong minority support for the statement that it was a goodidea to have a number of small parties as well as two or three big ones; but38% agreed with the statement that &quot;we would be better off with just onenational party&quot;.
Awareness of Problems Facing the Parties7.14 People were also asked if they knew of any internal problems facing the parries. Only 6% spontaneously mentioned problems of finance. The majorarea of concern was the internal trouble arising from rival or extremist groups mentioned by 30% of respondents. Half of the sample were, however,unable to think of any problems facing parties.7.1S People were also asked whether they thought parties had enough moneyto run their national and local organisations or whether some of them wereshort of money. Half the sample felt that at least some parties were short ofmoney although one-third of the sample did not think so.7.16 The Liberal Party was the party most often mentioned as being short of money followed by the Labour Party, the Scottish National Party, PlaidCymru and die Conservative Party.Awareness of P*rtfca* Financial SftearJoo7.17 When people were asked what parties needed money for, their answersindicated that the public are more alive to the intermittent public activity of parties than to their continuing administrative requirements. By far thelargest group of references related either to election canvassing or campaignsor more generally to advertising, publicity and propaganda. These were followedby references to headquarters, national administration, and the payment ofstaff:7.18 The public were asked where they thought each of the main parties gotits money from. Institutional sources dominated the answers in respect ofthe two major parties-exactly half of those mentioning sources of funds for the Conservative Party mentioned large companies, and a further 6%mentioned &quot;smaller firms&apos;&apos;; and 57% of those answering questions aboutthe Labour Party mentioned the trade unions. As regards the Liberal and other parties individual donations and subscriptions were the most frequentlymentioned sources. In general the public appeared to be reasonably wellinformed about the sources of party finance.Attitnde to Sources of Income7.19 Nearly one-third of all persons interviewed thought that the unions were a bad source of income for the Labour Party. Of those who thought that way,two-thirds did so because they considered that the unions thereby acquired too much influence over the party. About one-fifth of all persons interviewed thoughtthat large companies were a bad source of support for the Conservative Party.Of these, just over half took this view because they considered that such firmslikewise acquired too much influence.7.20 The respondents were asked whether they agreed with a-series of generalstatements about political parties and their money. 70% agreed that partiesneeded money to inform people about what they are doing. When asked whetherpolitical parties had far too much money, about half disagreed and one-third
agreed. Opinion was evenly divided on whether parties that failed to get sufficientfunds from their own supporters were worth supporting. Respondents were also evenly divided on whether they would be worried if they knew that themain political parties were short of money. Three-quarters agreed with thestatement that parties were too much influenced by people who gave them funds.Two-thirds agreed that parties could easily find other ways of getting money ifthey needed it.7.21 Respondents were also asked &quot;if the parties needed more money, in whatways do you think it could be provided ?&quot; The four sources most frequentlysuggested were: taxation/&quot;money from the Government&quot; (20%); more money from supporters (16%); a national lottery (13%); social events (10%). Three-quarters of the 8 % of respondents who identified themselves as members of a party, and about one-third of the remainder, said that they would be preparedto contribute more to party funds if asked.Attitude to State Aid7.22 The question &quot;assuming that the parties needed money, would you beprepared for some of it to be provided by the state from public funds&quot; producedan almost equal division of opinion, 45% saying &quot;yes&quot;; 44% saying &quot;no&quot;; and11% &quot;don&apos;t know&quot;. Men in the middle-age groups and people with &quot;highpolitical interest&apos;&apos; were more in favour of the proposal than the average.7.23 There were a number of reasons given for the rejection of the principleof state aid. 32 % felt taxes/rates were too high already; 18 % felt the money was needed for essentials and would be wasted; and 16 % felt that the parties should raise their own money.7.24 To test further the acceptability or otherwise of providing parties withstate aid people were asked whether money should be provided immediately.Only 15 % were in favour of immediate action but 55 % would be in favour in abetter economic situation.7.25 There was considerable divergence of opinion about the need for rertric-tious on state aid. Almost one-third thought that state aid should not be usedfor entertaining and 11 % thought it should not be used for foreign visits. One-third of the respondents did not mention any restrictions.7.26 In reply to the question &quot;if money were provided from public funds,should it be to all parties?&quot;, about two-thirds said &quot;yes&quot;. 10% of the totalsample (47 % of those who wished there to be restrictions) said they would liketo see the Communist Party excluded.7.27 As regards allocation, respondents were asked whether they thought mostof the money for state aid should go to the national party; or to the localconstituency parties; or about the same to each; or should the party decide how to divide it. 42% said that the parties should be left to decide themselveshow their state aid should be allocated, while 25 % thought that the aid shouldbe equally divided between the national and constituency parties.
FOREIGN PRACTICEIntroduction8.1 Our terms of reference required us to examine the ways in which political parties were financed in other parliamentary democracies. Many countries have in recent years introduced some form of public financing of parties, and it seemed likely that, even allowing for political, social and economic differences, a greatdeal could be learned from an examination of overseas experience.8.2 Groups of the Committee visited four countries Austria, the federal republic of Germany, The Netherlands and Sweden. During these visits we had discussions with politicians, party officers, government officials, academics andpolitical commentators. We were also able to visit two of West Germany&apos;political education and research institutions. In addition, one of our memberstook the opportunity, while on a private visit to the United States, to discussthe recently introduced Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments.8.3 We chose to visit these particular four countries because they had intro-duced different forms of state aid for their political parties or party activities andtheir schemes had reached various stages of development. The political parties in West Germany and Sweden had been receiving aid at both national and provincial level for some years. In Austria a decision was taken in 1975 toextend considerably what had been previously a fairly modest scheme of stateaid. The Netherlands had no general subsidies to the parties, but grants on asmall scale had recently been introduced for the parties&apos; research and educationinstitutes.8.4 We wish to place on record our thanks to all whom we met on our visits.We were received everywhere with considerable courtesy and hospitality;everyone gave generously of their time and we invariably received full and frankreplies to our many questions. We are also grateful to HM Ambassadors inVienna, Bonn, The Hague and Stockholm, and their staffs, who were responsiblefor arranging our visits; and to HM Ambassador in Washington and his staff.In the course of our enquiries generally we received much useful information from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Research Department, and wewere also helped by written material submitted by Mr Herbert Alexander,Mr Neville Johnson, Mr Dick Leonard and Mr Alan Watson.8.5 We also took the opportunity of discussing party financing with a group of Canadian politicians, an American Congressman and a member of theAmerican Federal Elections Commission, and a member of the Danish Parlia-ment, all of whom were visiting London and kindly agreed to meet us.8.6 Accounts of our visits to the four European countries are given in Annex H.These include details of the various subsidy schemes and what we saw as theireffects on the countries&apos; political affairs. Information on the forms of stateaid adopted in several other countries is given in Annex I. Included are Denmark,
Finland, Italy and Norway, where the parties receive a fairly substantial measure of aid; Canada and the United States, where aid has been introduced on a limited scale; and France and Japan, where aid, in so far as it exists, is confined to assistance at elections and the parties&apos; activities in parliament8.7 We were always conscious of the different historical backgrounds andvarying circumstances that led up to the decisions to introduce state aid, althoughthe parties&apos; difficulties in meeting rising costs was a recurring theme in mostparliamentary democracies. Nevertheless our recommendations in this report are influenced in no small measure by what we learnt overseas. We were impressed, for example, with the apparent efficiency of the German and Swedishparties and their interest in stimulating political debate at all levels. Partymorale was high and they had the resources to enable them to compete on equal terms with other institutions. The introduction of subsidies had producedfew adverse side-effects. Other forms of income, other than donations from industry, had not fallen and party membership had in fact risen appreciably.Great care had been taken in all the countries we visited to ensure that the subsidies were distributed fairly, usually on the basis of the parties&apos; electoralperformance at the preceding general election. This had undoubtedly contributedgreatly to the general acceptance of the subsidies by the parties and the public generally.How the Parties are Financed8.8 Political parties in the parliamentary democracies are essentially voluntary organisations. Until comparatively recently they were generally financed solelyfrom money provided by their members; by their own investments and com-mercial undertakings; and by those institutions, for example, trade unions and companies, whose interests they represent8.9 Most West European parties rely heavily on membership dues, whichare usually set at a fairly high level (see paragraph 5.30). In France, however,regular membership subscriptions form only a small part of the parties&apos; total income, although large amounts are received from individual supporters bymeans of periodic appeals. In most European democracies right wing partiesgenerally receive substantial financial backing from industry, and in many countries socialist parties are supported by the trade unions. A notable exception to this, however, is West Germany where direct political contributions to theparties by the trade unions are forbidden by law. In Austria, France, Italy and west Germany most parties require their members of parliament to contributea proportion of their salaries to party funds.8.10 This general pattern is followed outside Europe, although in mostnon-European parliamentary democracies the amounts received by way of regular membership dues appear to be small. In the United States and Canada,for example, a great deal of money is raised at elections by special fund-raisingappeals.Extent of State Ssfport8.11 Although direct state financial aid to political parties in Western europe and elsewhere is a fairly recent development, many political parties have long
benefited from state support in a number of other ways. For example, aid hasbeen frequently given to party groups in the legislatures towards the cost of employing secretarial and research assistance; and financial help at electionsis often given through free television and radio time and other electoral aids.But subsidies for party activity unconnected with elections or the legislaturehave only existed for the last twenty years.Reasons for the lotroaactioa of Public Subsidies8.12 The widespread development of subsidies to political parties during thelast two decades suggests that the countries concerned have been moved by common needs. Apart from the obvious fact that most of the parties involved were finding it difficult to maintain their existing activities from traditionalresources it is not easy to say what these common factors were. It is true thatall the parties have been affected by inflation in recent years, although theintroduction of a party subsidy in some instances pre-dated the more seriousinflation rates of the last few years. The costs of communication, always oneof the main items of party expenditure, have risen sharply in many countries.Parties have had to improve their standards of presentation in order to get their political messages across to the general public in competition with the rivalattractions of television. But several party representatives told us that rising costs in the communications field made such improvements increasingly difficultto achieve.8.13 Although rising costs were common to most countries the decision tointroduce some form of public subsidy seems to have been arrived at by differentroutes in the different countries, as the following examples show.8.14 In Sweden, the newspaper industry, which was very closely linked withand partly owned by the political parties, underwent a severe financial crisis inthe 1930s and early 1960s, As a direct result, public funds were made available tothe parties in 1966. A Royal Commission set up to examine the plight of the press had recommended that a subsidy should be paid to the industry via the political parties. In the event aid was given to the parties without conditions.8.15 In the Federal Republic of Germany, on the other hand, it appears thatsubsidies were introduced primarily in order to free the parties from dependence on financial support from business interests. To do this donations to parties were made taxable in 1968 and state aid was introduced.8.16 In Austria the parties found that they were no longer able to raise sufficientincome to meet increased costs. The governing party, the Socialist Party ofAustria, was anxious that legislation should be introduced to require partiesto publish their accounts and to settle their legal status. The parties&apos; need fora subsidy provided an opportunity for this to be done.8.17 State aid was provided in The Netherlands for the parties&apos; researchinstitutes and political education centres because the main parties were findingit increasingly difficult to finance these activities. They were regarded as essentialto the country&apos;! democratic system of government and steps were thereforetaken to ensure their survival and development.
8.18 In the United States, public funds have been made available for the1975-76 Presidential election campaign under the Federal Election CampaignAct Amendments. This legislation stemmed mainly from widespread public demand for radical changes in the system of campaign finance, particularly inview of the campaign finance abuses revealed during the Watergate affair.The Cost of Party Subsidies8.19 Where aid is given to the parties generally, the amounts paid are oftenvery large, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of the parties&apos; total income. In Sweden, a country of some 8 million people, the parties will receive a total of approximately 118 million kroner (about  14-8 million) in national,county and municipal subsidies in 1976 and state support now represents a major source of income for all established parries in that country.8.20 In West Germany, aid is given for election campaign costs, although itspayment is spread over non-election years also, and in support of the research and education institutes associated with the parties. A total of DM 145-6rnillion (about  31-7 million) will have been paid to the parties at national level during the four years 1973-76, and a further DM 100 million (about 22 million) over the five-year period 1970-75 at Land level. This does not include the grants given to the institutes.8.21 A total of AS 50 million (about  1-5 million) is distributed to the Austrianparties each year at national level in addition to up to AS 20 million ( 614,000)a year paid to the parties&apos; political academies, and AS 5 million ( 154,000)for political publications. In addition, the parties receive substantial subsidiesfrom the provincial governments.8.22 As a result of legislation introduced in 1974, Italian parties now share45 billion lire (about  30 million) a year, plus a further 15 billion lire (about 10 rnillion) at each general election. A total of 16 million marks ( 2-3 million)is given to the parties each year in Finland. Norwegian parties represented inParliament receive an annual subsidy; the total paid to the parties in 1973 was approximately 11 miUion kroner ( 1-1 million). In 77w Netherlands, while nostate aid is given directly to the political parties, a total of Fls 1,520,000 ( 312,000)a year is given to the parties&apos; research institutes and a further Fis 1,970,000( 400,000) a year is provided for their political education institutes.Reaction to the Subsidies8.23 In the countries we visited public reaction to party subsidies seemed tobe one of acceptance or indifference, and there was no evidence of any pressure to end them. The public generally seemed to have accepted that some form offinancial assistance was inevitable if the parties were to carry out their essentialfunctions effectively. They saw the state subsidy as a more attractive alternativethan the parties&apos; dependence on business interests.8 24 We were told that the principle of state aid had been accepted also byvirtually all the political parties, despite initial hesitation by some. Therehad been early opposition to the subsidies in Sweden, but this had changed
to acquiesence. Generally, the party subsidies were no longer questioned in debate. It seemed that once introduced they were quickly accepted by thepublic as a reasonable method of helping to finance parties.8.25 During our visits to the four European countries we heard repeatedly that people generally realised the importance of political parties in maintaining their democratic system. This feeling was particularly strong in those countries where dictatorships or foreign occupation had in the past destroyed theirdemocracies. They were therefore prepared to ensure that the parties wereadequately financed and the high level of membership dues reflected this. un austria and West Germany in particular we were deeply impressed by adeterrnination to maintain, and nurture their political institutions. We were told on more than one occasion that because of the chequered history of theirdemocratic institutions eveiything was now being done to ensure that political parties were able to operate freely and effectively.Effects of State Aid8.26 In Sweden and West Germany where subsidies have been in being forsome years, we noted the apparent affluence, by British standards at least, ofthe major parties. They seemed to be well organised and well housed. they said that by paying salaries at competitive rates they were able to attract staffof good calibre. They claimed that during elections they were able to conducteffective campaigns. In non-election years they were apparently able tomaintain excellent communications with party members and initiate a greatdeal of internal debate on policy matters at all levels.8.27 The main parties in both Sweden and West Germany said that they had found that the additional income provided by the subsidies had enabled themto function in a much more professional manner. They had built up large and well-serviced staffs and they had been able to develop first class links both with their own local workers and the public generally. Members were kept wellinformed and encouraged to participate fully in the formulation of policy.8.28 These organisational improvements were also to be found at provinciallevel. In West Germany substantial subsidies are paid to the Land party organisations by the provincial governments, and in Sweden the parties also receive aid at county and municipal level. This means that the regional andlocal parties are in the main financially independent of the party headquarters and were in a position to stimulate interest in local political issues.8.29 It appears that thorough training faculties have been established forparty workers and candidates. Training courses and seminars are provided bythe main German parties through their national research and educationinstitutes, which are partly financed by state funds. In Austria, a similar roleis played by the parties&apos; political academies, which have been receiving subsidiessince 1972.8.30 We were told that during elections the parties in Sweden and west germany are able to create considerable public interest, although we had nomeans of verifying this. Despite the absence of a strong tradition of voluntary
canvassing, the parties are said to be able, through their increased resources,to establish contact with the public through the distribution of written material and the mounting of extensive advertising campaigns. In Germany, in particular,the parties spend a great deal of money on election campaigning (aboutDM 100 million ( 21-8 million) was spent in 1972), and it seems generally agreed that it would be sensible to reduce this expenditure. There is a tradition of very high polls in both countries, and a 90% turnout is not unusual for either national or local government elections.8.31 One of the objects of providing the parties with public funds was toreduce their dependence on financial support from any one source, for exampleindustry. This object seems to have been achieved in both Sweden and Germany.In Sweden the subsidy now forms by far the main source of income for the major parties&apos; central organisations, and it seems doubtful whether many ofthe parties could now survive without it. In Germany, too, public aid nowaccounts for a substantial proportion of income for the major parties at central and Land level.8.32 We heard no evidence in Sweden and Germany to suggest that dependence on the state for such a high proportion of their income inhibited the parties in any way. None of the opposition parties considered that there was any riskof interference by government in any of their activities. On the contrary, itwas clear that money provided from state funds was regarded as the only&quot;neutral&quot; money received by the parties.8.33 Subsidies do not appear to have had any adverse effect on party member-ship or voluntary activity in these two countries. Membership of all the Germanparties, and all but one of the Swedish parties, has increased in recent years.We were assured that the additional income had made it possible for the parties,by improving organisation and increasing their written material, to stimulatemore political activity amongst their members.8.34 In both Sweden and Germany there has been some falling off, in real terms, in the level of voluntary donations including contributions from industry.Accountability and Disclosure8.35 The parties in Sweden and West Germany are not obliged to account forthe spending of any of the extensive subsidies received. In West Germany, forexample, the major parties receive substantial amounts of assistance towardsthe cost of running their research and education institutes, but are not requiredto publish accounts in respect of these establishments. The parties generally are obliged to publish only sources of income, with donations of over 20,000DMs ( 4,357) specified and the name and address of the donor given. Theyare not required to produce any details of expenditure. There is no requirementplaced on the Swedish parties to publish any information about their financialaffairs.
8.36 In Austria, on the other hand, parties receiving a subsidy have to presentaudited accounts of total income and expenditure to the Federal Minister ofFinance. They are also required to prepare detailed records showing how theirgrant was disbursed.8.37 In Finland the parties are required to give an annual account of how the subsidies have been spent but, in practice, all normal party activities are considered acceptable. In Italy details of party income must be published butinformation on expenditure is not required. In The Netherlands, where aidis directed solely to the support of the parties&apos; research and education institutesthe subsidies are linked to the inspection of accounts. In the United States,the disclosure requirements are extensive.
THE CASE FOR STATE AIDParty Politics and Democracy9.1 Effective political parties are the crux of democratic government without them democracy withers and decays. Their role is all pervasive. They providethe men and women, and the policies for all levels of government from the parish council to the European Parliament The parties in opposition have theresponsibility of scrutinising and checking all the actions of the Executive.Parties are the people&apos;s watchdog, the guardian of our liberties. At electiontimes it is they who run the campaigns and whose job it is to give the votersa clear-cut choice between different men and different measures. At all timesthey are the vital link between the government and the governed. Their functionis to maximise the participation of the people in decision-making at all levels of government. In short they are the mainspring of all the processes of democracy. If parties fail, whether from lack of resources or vision, democracyitself will fail.9.2 What some sections of public opinion may not have fully realised, however,is that the manifold tasks and responsibilities of political parties are very muchmore demanding on physical and material resources today than they used to be.And they are more demanding because of the enormous expansion in thefunctions of government A century ago the tasks of government were mainlypassive and regulatory. Now they involve a much more active and positiveengagement in our affairs. The government^ traditional regulatory functionshave multiplied and greatly broadened in scope. To these have been addedvast new responsibilities. This has been particularly marked since the second world War. The role of government now embraces responsibility for themaintenance of full employment and the provision of comprehensive social services; and such general economic aims as a satisfactory rate of growth,stable prices and a healthy balance of payments. Through public ownershipgovernment has become responsible for most of our basic industries. It hasassumed responsibility, too, for town and country planning. The latest and perhaps most far-reaching duty we now call on government to perform is thegeneral preservation and improvement of the environment.9.3 Our position in the world has also changed out of all recognition. our economy is at present weak and our international relationships are of anentirely different order. If we are to survive in this new world, we need not onlythe finest industrial, business and commercial skills, but also the higheststandard of political discussion and decision. In this the parties have a crucialrole to play.The Performance of Parties9.4 It is against this changing background that we must measure the per-formance of our political parties. Everything that government is nowadaysconcerned with should also be the concern of political parties. But whilst thebureaucracy and powers of the state have been greatly expanded to carry out
its greatly enlarged responsibilities, our political parties have lagged behind.To be effective in the context of the vastly expanded role of modern government,the parties need to raise their sights, widen their vision and greatly expand their efforts and resources.9.5 We might accordingly have recommended committing really substantialresources to improving the quality of the political parties&apos; performance in britain, even at this time of economic difficulty. The one type of additional expenditure that can be justified at a time like this is investment in nationalefficiency, and there is every reason for including political parties within thatcategory. We must, however, be realistic and take into account the speed withwhich the parties could reorganise and expand to attain the higher standards and wider scope that we envisage, as well as the present restraints imposedupon all increases in public expenditure. Both these factors have led us to concentrate upon bare essentials as our immediate task.9.6 This means that the parties must be able to carry out at least a reasonablyefficient job of research, policy formulation, publicity and communication tostandards which match the expectations and requirements of today&apos;s electorate,and which are commensurate with the problems now facing the country. Ineffect, we are arguing that there is a minimum level of activity and efficiencyfor political parties, and that it would seriously hamper the working of democracy and the machinery of government if they fell below this level forany length of time.9.7 What particularly impressed us on our visits to Europe was not so much the details or history of the various schemes for state aid, which are obviouslyinfluenced by local circumstances, as the realisation, brought home to us aswe visited party offices and talked to party and government officials, of how much could be done to improve the effectiveness of parties in their role ofpolitical and national leadership if adequate resources were available.9.S By contrast, the evidence we have gathered in this country shows that party organisation is in a number of cases weak at national level, and at locallevel generally exists on a pitifully inadequate scale of accommodation, equip-ment, trained staff and resources. Membership fees are low; fund-raising takesup too much time; organisation is frequently inadequate; and the level ofpolitical activity is far below what is needed to gain the attention and interestof the general body of the electorate, especially the young. Our consideredview is that British political parties frequently operate below the minimumlevel of efficiency and activity required.9.9 If this is the state of our parties now, how then are they likely to fare inthe immediate future ? The range of work required of political parties is con-continually on the increase. Merely on the basis of their existing responsibilities,and to cope with inflation, parties would still have to raise additional finance.But these responsibilities are likely to be increased in the next few years by the repercussions of devolution to Scotland and Wales, and by the introductionof direct elections to the European Parliament. Parties will therefore need toraise very substantial additional funds if they are to achieve even a modestimprovement in their present degree of effectiveness.
9.10 Parliament itself has recognised in recent years the increasing cost ofall forms of political activity. For example, the salaries and allowances ofMembers of Parliament have been raised; increased provision has been madefor research and secretarial assistance; and a scheme to provide financialassistance to opposition parties in carrying out their Parliamentary businesshas been introduced (see paragraph 1.4). Proposals have also been put forward by a Select Committee of the House for further improvements in the freesupport services available to Private Members (see paragraph 1.5).PotenthU Sources of Additional Finance9.11 Given the action already taken within Parliament, how is die extramoney to be found for the political activities of the parties outside Parliament ?Could it be raised from the parties&apos; traditional sources? We have noted the considerable efforts the parties have made to raise their incomes over the last few years. But we have also noted that their best efforts have done no morethan enable them to keep pace with inflation, and that they have maintained their existing inadequate level of activity only at the expense of drawing heavilyupon their reserves. Obviously the parties cannot go on like this. We have seenno sign of an increase in their real resources which the situation of the countryrequires, and there is at least a doubt whether they can maintain even theirpresent level of activity.9.12 As regards membership fees, these have traditionally been largelynominal. This is probably because parties have been regarded as a voluntarymovement bom of idealism, and sustained by a plentiful supply of disinterestedservice on the doorstep and in the market place. Members of parties haveneither expected nor received much attention or service from their party.On such low subscriptions increased membership has scarcely been worthwhilefinancially, Few constituency parties have developed efficient systems of collection, though some have tried employing paid collectors. In our view theparties have very little scope for increasing their income from individual member-ship subscriptions on anything like a scale sufficient to meet future needs.Although membership fees are low, there is clearly a risk that any marked increase in fees would result in a loss of membership. Furthermore, partymembers provide voluntary service as well as financial support. They are thewilling horses of politics, and all parties are already heavily indebted to them.If membership fees are increased it is they, the loyal and devoted members,who will have to pay. It is not surprising, and certainly not unworthy, thatparties should look elsewhere for the extra money they need.9 13 We do not believe that other traditional fund raising activities in the constituencies can be expanded on the necessary scale. For example, in thecase of lotteries, the Labour agents assured us that because of growing competi-tion it would be extremely difficult to increase income from this source; andour evidence shows that a number of constituency parties would in any case be opposed in principle to raising more money in this way.
9.14 If additional resources are to be forthcoming on the scale required,they can only come from industry and business for the Conservative Party,and from the trade unions for the Labour Party. But the signs are not encouraging-ing. The record over recent years suggests a drop in donations to the Conserva-tive Party in real terms, especially between elections. And for its part, the LabourParty has already brought forward by one year an agreed increase in tradeunion affiliation fees, making two increases in a single year, and in evidencesome trade unions expressed caution as to whether the political levy could befurther increased to a point out of scale with the general level of union con-tributions. The trend of other future events may also be unfavourable. We have yet to see, for example, what difference worker participation may make tocompany donations.9.15 But even if sufficient funds were forthcoming from these sources wewould nevertheless see this further dependence on institutional support as an undesirable development. Whilst we received no evidence to suggest that in-stitutional supporters make their support conditional upon the right to in-fluence party policies4, we feel that the standing of the Labour and Conservativeparties with the general public might well be seriously impaired if they were seen to depend for their continued existence on ever increasing amounts ofinstitutional support.9.16 Other parties, in any case, cannot expect institutional support to providethe additional funds they need. The Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymruare unlikely to escape financial problems in future, especially as they come toundertake new responsibilities within their respective national assemblies,and develop a stronger European dimension.The Need for State Aid9.17 Under these circumstances we consider that a modest injection of stateaid is the best, and perhaps the only, way of arresting the run-down of theparties, and of starting the process by which their effectiveness can be raised to an adequate level. Such a boost would enable the parties to extend their activities. Moreover, the higher efficiency attained would, we believe, itselfgenerate more support and increase their capacity to raise more moneythemselves.9.18 The amount of aid required in present circumstances must inevitablyrest on a general judgment: it is not susceptible to precise assessment. Dearly,however, there are certain broad factors to be taken into account. The amountshould provide significant help to the parties, but should not be too high inrelation to their other financial resources. It is desirable that the amount of aid given should not discourage voluntary effort or the constituency activitywhich at present centres around fund-raising. Above all, no proposal for ex-penditure at the present time can ignore the country*s economic position andthe pressure of competing demands on the nation&apos;s resources.&quot;Although the influence of the trade unions on Labour Party policies through affiliationfees which carry a card vote at the Party Conference must not be overlooked.
9.19 Having carefully considered what scale of state aid would best satisfythese criteria, we recommend that the total amount should be no more than about 20% of the present combined central and constituency incomes of theparties.9.20 We recommend that this help should be given to the parties at both thecentral and local levels. In the next chapter we outline the details of a scheme,costing on average about  860,000 a year, to assist the parties at constituencylevel through the partial reimbursement of candidates&apos; election expenses,both at parliamentary and local government elections. We see these reimburse-ment proposals as a means of directly aiding local party funds. They wouldalso provide support for the electoral system and be a means of equalisingopportunities for candidature. In this regard we would point out the benefit which many independent candidates would also derive from these proposals,particularly in local government elections.9.21 But there is also a need to provide help specifically for the parties at thecentre. For this purpose we propose that assistance totalling about  1$ million a year should be allocated to party headquarters on the basis of their electoralsuccess. Details of this scheme are also given in the following chapter. Thiswould mean that the total amount of state aid provided would be something over  2J million a year. Most of this money would go, either directly or in-directly, to the main political parties, and this would represent something ofthe order of 20% of our estimate of their present combined annual central andconstituency incomes (see Chapter 6).9.22 We recognise that by comparison with the countries that we visited theseproposals together represent a very modest scheme for state aid. For example,Sweden with a population less than one-sixth of that of the United Kingdom,provides aid to its political parties on a scale approximately six times that whichwe propose. We do not consider, however, that we should recommend more in present circumstances. But it will be necessary to examine from time to timethe extent to which the sums proposed succeed in maintaining and improving the effectiveness of the parties. We would therefore propose that there should bea review of the amounts paid under the annual grant scheme towards the mid-term of every Parliament of normal length; Provided the criteria outlined inparagraph 9.18 are adhered to, regular reviews should ensure that aid is kept to a reasonable level.Dirfknrties Raised in Evidence9.23 A number of our witnesses opposed state aid on various grounds, someof which they saw as matters of fundamental principle. We have examinedthese objections with care, especially in the light of what actually happens inthe many countries which already have state aid, and find them to have littlesubstance.9.24 Central to these objections has been the argument that political parties are voluntary bodies formed and supported by like-minded people to furthertheir aims by political means, and that the voluntary nature of this free associated -ation is fundamental and must be strictly maintained. It is feared that any
breach of this principle will lead to some loss of independence, and that thestate may interfere with their affairs by attaching conditions to a subsidy. Inother words, if the state helps to pay the piper, the state may want to call some part of the tune.9.25 Clearly the introduction of state aid would mark a new departure inBritish political life in the sense that never before has public money been grantedto the political parties, except in relation to their parliamentary business or aspart of the machinery of elections. Novelty is, however, no disqualification fora good idea supported by experience in other parliamentary democracies and shown in our view to be desirable here.9.26 We do not consider that political democracy in the United Kingdom isabove the reach of change. The experience of other political democracies mustbe of some account. In most Western European democracies the political parties now receive state aid. Even in the United States it exists in a limited form.Over and over again it has been found that the doubts and fears expressedby the opponents of state aid have not been realised. There has been no evidencethat state aid necessarily affects the independent status of the parties, or thebalance of power within them. Nor has it led to any reluctance to criticise the government of the day. On the contrary, in the European countries thatwe visited state aid is regarded, unlike business or other institutional support,as &quot;neutral&quot; money-aid without strings. It is seen as a buttress to their systemof representative government, inseparable in principle from the state-financedinstitution of parliament itself and of the electoral system of a parliamentarydemocracy.9.27 As to public acceptability, the European evidence suggests that any public disquiet there may have been at the introduction of state aid soonevaporated in the light of experience. Our own public opinion survey showsthat opinion in this country is almost equally divided between those who favourand oppose state aid in principle. We are confident, however, that if a scheme ofstate aid with appropriate safeguards were to be introduced here, the experience in this respect would be similar to that of other European countries.9.28 It has also been argued that it is unacceptable in principle that people should be compelled to contribute, through taxation, to the maintenance ofpolitical parties of whose aims they do not approve. In this respect we wouldnot see the introduction of state aid as raising any different questions ofprinciple from those that arise in many other instances where a taxpayer isrequired to contribute towards areas of government expenditure with which hemay not be personally in sympathy, but which Parliament has approved. we take the view that it is manifestly in the public interest that the parties should be run on an effective basis; our political institutions depend upon this. The amount paid by an individual taxpayer should be regarded as supporting the partysystem as a whole, and the essential part which it plays in our form of parlia-mentary democracy.9.29 As a development of this argument the point has been made that if stateaid were introduced it would be possible for extremist parties to qualify forassistance. Under our qualifying provisions (see paragraph 10.22) it would,
however, be necessary for a party to have a substantial body of electoral sup-port before it could receive any aid. If a party achieved this level of public support, payment would be justified, not by that party&apos;s policies but by the votes of the people, and the general democratic principle of equal opportunityfor all lawful competitors in politics. Moreover, no party is at present excludedfrom the assistance now given in kind at elections, for example, free poll cardsand the free delivery of an election address. The right answer to extremism iseffective, healthy rivalry from parties which are not extreme, and this is precisely what our proposals for state aid are designed to promote.9.30 Again, some witnesses have alleged that the introduction of state aidwould lead to the decline of voluntary effort and other sources of financial support, and would also have a serious detrimental effect on the structures ofthe parties themselves, leading inevitably to over-centralisation. We are confident that nothing we have proposed would in fact have any adverse effect on theparties&apos; existing fund-raising activities, whether it be individual donations,the trade union political levy or company support. For some parties at least the pump-priming effect of state aid may actually increase their capacity toraise their own finances. We have deliberately limited the amount of aid whichparties would receive to ensure that no party would be able to rest on its oars.9.31 As to whether the introduction of state aid might dry up either financial support for the parties from other sources, or voluntary activity by their members, we draw once more upon European evidence. We saw nothing tosuggest that the volume of voluntary effort in those countries we visited has beensignificantly affected; indeed, it has sometimes increased. Alternative sources of funds do not dry up. Neither from our own visits nor from written memoranda on the experience of other countries have we found any evidence that a well-thought out scheme of state aid need have these disadvantages. State support in Germany, Austria, and Sweden has proved consistent with rising membership and with subscription levels on a scale far beyond what even the most optimisticcould expect in Britain.9.32 In putting forward our proposals for state aid we have tried to ensurethat they would not entail any distortion of the party structures. All parties should continue to be what their members want them to be. We have refrained from recommending anything which, in our view, would change the structure of the parties. As regards the risk of over-centralisation, we believe that the pro-posals for the partial reimbursement of candidates&apos; election expenses, (see paragraphs 10.38 to 10.59) will significantly aid the parties at constituency level.This would act as a counter-weight to our other proposal to aid the partiescentrally. Indeed, if no state aid were to be introduced at all it is inevitable thatthe Labour and Conservative parties would look to their institutional supportersfor additional funds. The bulk of this would be received by the parties centrally,and would be more likely than our proposals to lead to further centralisation.9.33 The effect of state aid on party activity at the local level is clearly one of the factors which must be taken into account in considering the scale of assistanceto the parties This we have done. We believe that the injection of state aid on the limited scale we propose will, for the reasons we have stated, tend to stimulaterather than depress local political activity.
9.34 We fully recognise that state aid for the political parties represents some additional burden on public expenditure at a time when other desirable calls onthe public purse cannot be fully met We consider, however, that the needs of theparties are urgent and, in the modest form we propose, the total cost is small. Ithas been suggested that we should delay giving aid until the parties are faced withbankruptcy. This would be too late, more expensive and would gravely disruptour political and parliamentary life. Our recommendations amount to a provi-dent stitch in time. Similar arguments lay behind the proposals of the RoyalCommission on the Press for aid to newspapers. In any case if we do nothing to aid the parties we put in jeopardy all our political institutions. This is a gamblewhich the country cannot afford to take.9.35 It has also been argued that the financial difficulties of the parties aretemporary, and have only arisen because of the two general elections in 1974and the recent high rate of inflation. But that is not what is shown by the recordswe have obtained of party income. To measure up to the growing responsibilities which we have described they should have been increasing their income andexpenditure in real terms. In spite of continuous and vigorous efforts they havebeen unable to do so. There could be more than a passing connection between this and the relative backwardness of the country in recent years, compared toa number of other democracies, in solving its economic as well as its political problems. The parties are an essential means of participation by citizens in our system of government Inasmuch as the parties are unable to respond to theirrising responsibilities, the whole process of government must suffer.
CHAPTER 10FORMS OF STATE AIDIntroduction10.1 This chapter deals with a number of general considerations relating to schemes for state aid, examines a series of different forms which state aid might take, and then puts forward detailed proposals for an annual grant to political parties based on their electoral performance and for the limited reimbursement of candidates&apos; expenses at Parliamentary and other elections.Fairness10.2 Any scheme for financial aid to political parties must be scrupulously fair.As far as possible the nature of any such scheme must not favour one party&apos;selectoral prospects in relation to that of any other. Nor should it disproportion-ately favour larger established parties to the disadvantage of smaller or newparties. The scheme should be impartial and should not stand in the way of anychange in the pattern of our political parties that the public may wish to make.The basis of the amounts payable to the parties must be clearly known and createas few marginal problems as possible.Nature of Payment10.3 As we see it, state aid for the political parties should be given at twolevels: central headquarters and the constituency organisations.10.4 Costs at headquarters level are increasing all the time and the expansionof research and policy departments will further this trend. Moreover, it is only atcentral and regional levels that an overall view can be taken of the competingneeds of individual constituencies for available resources, and of which par-ticular aspects of local party work, such as accommodation or staffing, needattention.10.5 The advantage of a separate measure of direct aid at constituency level is that it would help to onset some of the additional power at the centre thatmight otherwise arise from the introduction of state aid. Aid at local -level would be particularly valuable in relation to local government work, whereat present the cost falls primarily on the constituency organisations.Aid for General or Specfftc Purposes?10.6 We have considered whether any grant of financial aid to the parties should be made conditional on its being used for specific purposes, such asresearch, accommodation, or other particular areas of party expenditure.Whilst we consider that any funds made available to the parties should besubject to a measure of public accountability, it is desirable that the use towhich these are put should be left to the parties themselves. They are in thebest position to assess where their needs lie and, whilst attention has been drawn to areas of party work where we consider improvements could usefully be made (see paragraphs 3.12 to 3.20), it would be wrong to use state aid to
influence the development of political parties by stipulations of any kind.Different parties have different priorities. Aid for a particular purpose might thus help one party but not another. A subsidy granted for a specific purpose,for example research or organisation, would merely lead to a re-allocation of a party&apos;s own resources. We therefore favour block grants for the parties to allocate as they think best.10.7 We considered especially carefully whether to recommend making grantsseparately and directly for political education, but in the end we came downagainst it. Although this form of aid to the quality of politics is used in some european countries, we believe it would only complicate matters to includesuch proposals in our present recommendations. This does not imply in anyway a lack of concern about the paucity and poverty of the education services provided by our political parties, or for the financial struggles of the fewsocieties which are doing good work in this field, most of it without any help from the political parties themselves.Schemes Considered and Rejected10.8 In the light of these general considerations we have examined and rejected a number of possible forms which state aid to political parties might take.State aid in kind10.9 Whilst we see no reason for questioning the existing aid in kind to candi-dates and parties (see paragraphs 1.8 to 1.13) we do not consider that a casehas been made out for its extension. The needs of the parties differ considerably;whilst one party might want free accommodation and a party newspaper,another might prefer to have free research facilities, and another more staff at regional or constituency level. Such a scheme could therefore in our viewonly be of selective value to the parties, and its effects might be unfair.Matching aid10,10 A &quot;matching aid&quot; scheme would provide that the amount of state aidmade available to a political party would depend on what it raised from other sources; that is to say, the money raised from these other sources would be matched by a similar amount from the state. Such a scheme would favour theparties who are already better placed to raise funds from institutional sources.Some limit on the amount of &quot;matching aid&quot; would clearly be necessary.The accounting and audit arrangements would present special problems.The main objection is, however, that the amount of state aid would be in proportion to the fund-raising capacity of the respective parties and not to their needs or to the extent of their electoral support.Fiat rate grant to parties10.11 Although perhaps superficially attractive on grounds of equality oftreatment, such a proposal assumes the existence of comparable basic needs in all parties which the state should meet. This would not achieve the purpose
of state aid, which is to support and stimulate activity and efficiency in relationto the performance and success of the parties. We do not recommend such aproposal.Aid related to membership of parties10.12 We also examined, and decided against, schemes for financial assis-tance to parties based on the size, or increases in the size, of their respectivememberships. As noted in Chapter 5, membership of some parties is not closelydefined, and any scheme based on &quot;membership&quot; would therefore be difficultto audit and control. As membership depends to some extent on the amountof subscription; increased membership stimulated by lower contributions would open up the possibility of abuse.Voluntary contributions to qualify for &quot;charitable status&quot; for tax purposes10.13 We also considered whether there was a case for tax concessions ondonations to political parties, and whether this would be the right way of encouraging individual contributions. There appear to be three possibilities:(a) arrangements similar to those for charities whereby the parties couldclaim reimbursement of income tax on donations or subscriptionscovenanted for more than six years;(b) arrangements rather more favourable than that for charities, wherebypolitical parties could claim reimbursement of income tax on totaldonations or subscriptions at a composite rate without direct evidencethat the tax had in fact been paid by the donors;(c) making subscriptions and donations to political parties a &quot;pro-fessional&quot; or &quot;business&quot; expense deductible from taxable income.10.14 These suggestions might appear attractive, but the anomalies they would introduce and the administrative difficulties of operating them, including thedifficulty of distinguishing between corporate and individual donations,outweigh the advantages. Moreover, all of them would breach importantexisting principles of tax law. The main disadvantage is that such concessionswould operate in favour of the parties with better-off members and institutionalsupport. They would also make it necessary for individuals to declare their political loyalties to the Inland Revenue. The first and second arrangements would make the tax law unfair to charities. At present charities are not allowedto take part in political activities, and those that do so may forfeit their rightto be regarded as charities and to the accompanying financial benefits. The thirdalternative would equate the tax law relating to deductible business expenseswith donations to political parties. The amounts raised by all three schemes would be unpredictable, and there would be no necessary relationship betweenthe amounts raised and the needs of the parties. We do not therefore recommendany of these schemes.Allocation of part of tax payment10.15 A number of our witnesses recommended the &quot;tax check-off&quot; arrange-ments recently introduced in the United States for the Presidential election
campaigns. As the scheme now works, an American taxpayer can on his self-assessment form indicate whether or not one dollar of his taxes (two dollars for husband and wife) should be allocated to a Presidential Election CampaignFund.10.16 From the fund so formed payment is made to Presidential candidateswho fulfil certain qualifications. One of the qualifications which particularlyinterested our witnesses was that candidates must raise 5,000 dollars in eachof 20 states in contributions of no more than 250 dollars each.10.17 This scheme is part of a wide package of laws relating to the presidential election campaigns in the United States, Details are given in Annex I.10.18 The chief merit of such a scheme is that it would require a positivechoice on the part of the donor. It would thus avoid the criticism that people were being forced to contribute to political parties, whether they wanted to ornot. However appropriate such a scheme may be to American needs, we doubt whether it would work satisfactorily in the United Kingdom. The mainobjection to the adoption of a similar scheme here is that a diminishing numberof United Kingdom taxpayers are required to make an annual return to the inland Revenue. This distinguishes our tax system of PAYE from the Americanself-assessment system. There would also be formidable administrative problems arising from the complexities and cost of dealing with millions of tax allocations of necessarily small individual amounts. Furthermore, there would be nonecessary relationship between the amount raised in this way and what was needed.Recommended Schemes10.19 Having rejected the various schemes outlined in the foregoing paragraphsand taking account of the general considerations referred to in paragraphs10.2 to 10.7, we recommend that state aid should be given to political parties in the United Kingdom under a combination of two schemes only. These are: (i) annual grants to be paid from Exchequer funds to the central orgariis-ations of the parties for their general purposes, the amounts being determined according to the extent of each party&apos;s electoral support;and(ii) at local level, a limited reimbursement of the election expenses ofParliamentary and local government candidates.4AmunU GrantBasis of entitlement10.20 In our view, parties claiming the annual grant should be able to demon-strate a reasonable minimum of electoral support. Our starting point here isthat if the candidates of a particular party gain enough votes in at least sixParliamentary constituencies to save their deposits (that is one-eighth or more of*We recommend that the reimbursement scheme should be extended to include elections to me European Parliament and the Scottish and Welsh Assemblies as the occasion arises(see paragraphs 10.60 and 10.61).
the votes cast in each one), they should qualify for state aid. We would relatethis performance wholly to the results of the previous general election. Thisqualifying condition of &quot;six saved deposits&quot; would apply to all parties, including those operating in one part of the United Kingdom only, eg Scotland. Wethink that any party which succeeds in gaining one-eighth of the votes cast inat least six constituencies is a party with a foothold in our political life and should share in any scheme for state aid.10.21 It may be, however, that the criterion of a reasonable measure of electoralsupport could also be satisfied in other ways. If at a general election a partysecured the election of two Members of Parliament, this alone and irrespective of the votes or saving of the deposits of other candidates for that party, couldbe accepted as meeting our qualifying standard of electoral support. Again, a party which gained one seat only might claim recognition provided that it hadsignificant electoral support, say a total of 150,000 votes cast for that party inall the seats it contested in the same election. These two secondary qualifyingconditions which we add as alternatives to the main &quot;six saved deposits&quot;requirement are those which have already been accepted by Parliament asqualifying conditions for state aid to opposition parties at Westminster (seeparagraph 1.4).10.22 We accordingly recommend that to be eligible for grants under thisscheme a party must, at the previous general election, have either:(i) saved the deposits of its candidates in at least six constituencies; or(ii) had at least two of its candidates returned as Members; or(iii) had one of its candidates returned as a Member, and received as a party a total of not less than 150,000 votes.10.23 We believe that entitlement based solely on the previous general electionprovides a simple and fair basis for calculating the amount of aid under thescheme.10.24 We considered whether by-elections should be taken into account either for passing the threshold or for calculating the annual grant. We decided thatthe scheme should be kept as simple as possible, and that after each generalelection the eligibility and scale of entitlement of the parties should bedetermined and remain undisturbed for the duration of that Parliament.Calculation of amount10.25 The calculation of the annual grant payable to qualifying parties should be based on a specified sum per vote cast at the previous general electionfor candidates, whether elected or not, who declared themselves to be standing in the name of the party. This declaration might best be done on the ballot paper. Votes cast for candidates who lose their deposits would be reckonable.Cost10.26 We have already recommended in paragraph 9.21 that the total amountto be paid to the parties under this scheme should be about  1 \ miUion a year.
To achieve this we recommend that each of the qualifying parties should bepaid an annual sum, rounded to the nearest  1 above, calculated on the basisof 5p for each vote cast for its candidates at the previous general election.The annual amounts, totalling  1,442,379, that would be currently payable on the basis of 5p for each vote cast at the October 1974 General Election are shown at Annex J. We do not recommend any ceiling on the amount payable to an individual party. The size of the electorate will provide an overall ceilingon the amounts potentially payable.Administrative /arrangements10.27 The annual grant would be a grant in aid to the central organisations of the parties concerned for use as part of their general income subject tocertain conditions of audit and the submission of annual returns of income and expenditure as outlined below. The grant would be payable quarterly.In the event of a general election a party&apos;s eligibility and scale of entitlementwould remain unaffected until the next quarter day. Thereafter they would bebased on the results of the new general election.Audit and accountability10.28 The audit and accounting arrangements for the annual grant which werecommend are as follows.10.29 Provision should be made for payment out of the appropriate vote of agrant in aid to each party eligible, the amount in each case being calculated in accordance with the scale approved by Parliament. The estimate should provide that expenditure from the grant in aid will not be accounted for indetail to the Comptroller and Auditor Genera). Accordingly the receipt of thegrantee would be a sufficient voucher for the issue of the sum granted so faras the appropriation account is concerned.10.30 It will be necessary for the Accounting Officer of the Vote to whichthe grant is charged to identify the person who can give a valid receipt forthe money on behalf of the recipient party, and who can account for it. Weunderstand that this is now done by the Accounting Officer for the House ofCommons Vote for the purpose of payments out of that Vote in respect of expenses incurred by the opposition parties in relation to their parliamentary business. Accordingly we do not feel we need concern ourselves with the legalidentity of parties as accountable persons.10.31 The grant would be in aid of the general income of the party, notearmarked for expenditure on any specific object. Therefore, the normalrequirement for a government grant of the surrender of any unexpendedbalance at the end of the year of account will not apply. In fact, the onlycondition attached to the grant in aid would be the requirement that the recipient party should produce professionally audited accounts and should ensure that the form and content of the accounts give a correct and informativeview of the party&apos;s finances.10.32 The object of this accounting condition will be first to assure parliament and the public that the disposition of the taxpayers&apos; money included in the
resources of the party is under responsible control; and secondly, to giveParliament and the public an informative view of the relationship of the statesubsidy to the other resources of the party, and of the activities that are beingfinanced out of the party&apos;s resources.10.33 To this end we have drawn up a table (Annex K) showingthe information which, in our view, should be included in the annual accounts of the income,expenditure and assets of a party in receipt of state aid. In drawing up this tablewe have suggested the disclosure of large sums given to parties without identified-fying the donors. We do not feel it is part of our task to discourage such donationsor to encourage evasion by the use of &quot;front&quot; organisations. We do, however,consider it important and necessary that the existence of large donations from whatever source should be known.10.34 Ideally, a complete return of a party&apos;s finances would include, not onlythe accounts of the central party to whom the state aid is given, but also theincome, expenditure and assets of the parties in the constituencies. We wouldhave liked to recommend that the consolidation of headquarters and con-stituency accounts should be made a condition of state aid. We understand,however, that this is not a requirement with which any of the major partiescan comply, since under their constitutions each constituency party is a separateentity responsible for its own finances. We accept, therefore, as a second best,that the central party receiving the state aid should render an audited accountof its own finances, including its transactions with the constituency parties,but without consolidating its accounts with those of the constituencies. Wesuggest, however, that Parliament might wish to ask the parties to provide information, such as we collected in the course of our enquiry, about theirconstituency finances to add to the information in their central accounts,when the time comes to review the working of the state aid system and take decisions on its continuance with or without modifications.10.35 There remains the question whether the accounts of state-aided parties should be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny. The recognised rule for grant-aided bodies is that where the Comptroller and Auditor General is not appointedto audit the grantee&apos;s accounts, but the greater part of the grantee&apos;s incomederives from public funds, the paying department should ensure, as a conditionof grant, that the books and accounts of the grantee are open to inspectionby the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Comptroller and Auditor Generaldoes not duplicate the work of the professional auditor, but satisfies himself that any statutory requirements, or renditions made by government on behalfof Parliament, are observed. His inspection is also directed to the grantee&apos;ssystems of financial administration and control. In such cases, the report of the comptroller and. Auditor General on the Vote Account from which the grant in aid was issued could provide the opportunity for the Public accounts committee to question the Accounting Officer of the Vote accompanied by theappropriate officer of the grant-aided body, with, the accounts of thegrant-aided body made available at the hearing.        - (10.36 We have said (see paragraph 9.18) that state aid should not be too high in relation to the other financial resources available to the parties. If the
amount paid in state aid were assessed in accordance with this principle, thenormal Parliamentary rule requiring access for the Comptroller and AuditorGeneral is not likely to come into force for most recipient parties. But it mightapply to some where the incidence of aid was exceptional for example, anemerging party qualifying for aid for the first time, or an established partywhose electoral support is particularly high in relation to its financial resources.10.37 It might be thought unfair that access by the Comptroller and AuditorGeneral should be confined to the accounts of parties in these exceptionalsituations. The House of Commons can of course make such provision as itthinks fit for Parliamentary scrutiny as a condition of assistance from public funds. We are disposed to suggest that the Comptroller and Auditor general should have access to the books and accounts of all parties receiving state assistance, for the limited &quot;systems audit&quot; described above. Such a provision would serve the useful purpose of disarming some part at least of the criticism that state aid to a party is a present of taxpayers&apos; money with no questionsasked, as well as acting as a safeguard against allegations of abuse. It wouldhave the additional advantage that any matter arising from the scrutiny by the comptroller and Auditor General of the accounts of a state-aided party wouldbe considered on behalf of Parliament by the non-partisan Public accounts committee.Reimbursement of Expenses of Election Candidates10.38- As indicated in paragraph 10.19, the view of the Committee is that ascheme for financial assistance to political parties should also be introduced at local level. This should be by way of a limited reimbursement of candidates&apos;election expenses.Pnrttaaaeatery CandidatesBasis of entitlement10.39 We recommend that reimbursement should be restricted to thoseParliamentary candidates at general or by-elections who save their deposit,that is who poll at least one-eighth of the votes cast. Saving the deposit istraditionally regarded as uununum evidence of popular support. Without thatcondition, the numbers of frivolous candidatures might increase.Extent of reimbursement10.40 The amount to be reimbursed should be the candidates actual election expenses subject to a limit of half bis legally permitted maximum expenditure.10.41 The extent of reimbursement to candidates must be of significant benefitto them. Its basis must also be fair as between rival candidates. On the otherhand, we would not want to stimulate unnecessary additional expenditure orremove the need for candidates or constituency parties&apos;to raise money them-setves. We believe that the formula we have proposed is consistent withthese aims.
10.42 Our proposal is, we believe, to be preferred to the alternative whichwe considered of reimbursing half a candidate^ actual expenditure. this alternative would penalise those candidates who kept their election expensesdown. Our proposal applies a cut-off point which is common and fair to all.Cost10.43 The maximum permitted expenditure per candidate is at present 1,075 plus 6p for every 6 electors (county constituency) or every 8 electors(borough constituency). Constituency electorates range in size from 22,338in Glasgow Central to 122,666 in South Antrim and the permitted mflX&apos;m&apos;tmexpenditure varies accordingly. The average maximum per candidate at thetime of the October 1974 General Election was  1,627.10.44 In the two 1974 general elections the average number of candidatessaving their deposits was 1,807, giving a ratio of 2-8 candidates per seat Onthis basis the maximum total cost of the scheme would be something under It million for each general erection. Assuming that general elections takeplace every four years the average annual cost of the scheme, ignoring by-elections, would be of the order of  360,000. In practice the cost will be some-what lower because not all candidates who save their deposits will necessarilyspend as much as half their legally permitted maximum expenditure.Administrative arrangements10.45 The scheme would use the present arrangements for the determination and declaration of candidates&apos; expenses in Parliamentary elections. Underthe Representation of the People Acts a candidate for election has to appoint an election agent, who may be the candidate himself, to look after the conductof the campaign, and in particular to control the expenditure on it. After the poll, the candidate and his agent make a declaration of expenses before a justice of the Peace, a Chairman or the proper officer of the County Council, DistrictCouncil or Greater London Council in England and Wales, an officer appointed for the purpose by a Scottish local authority, or, in Northern Ireland, a Clerkto the District Council, the declaration being supported by bills and receipts.Election expenses are limited both in amount and in kind, and the declarationcovers both aspects. The declaration and supporting documents are sent to the returning officer to be held available for inspection. It is open to challenge in theCourts if, for example, the validity of an election is called in question.10.46 We feel therefore that it is reasonable to expect the declaration of expenses to be a correct account of what the candidate actually spends, andthat there is no need for further checking or auditing except through theCourts.10.47 The candidates who wished to claim reimbursement would apply to theGovernment department admimstering the scheme, quoting their declaration of expenses and the number of votes cast for them. These claims would be checkedagainst the returning officer&apos;8 count of the votes and the declaration of expensesheld by him. Payment would then be made directly to the candidate.
10.48 Since the Home Office publishes a report of the voting figures and expenses of candidates in each constituency, we think it would be helpful andinformative if they were to include in that report the amounts paid out irreimbursement.Audit and accountability10.49 Unlike the scheme for direct aid to parties, the reimbursement of candidates&apos; election expenses presents no problem of public accountability.The Accounting Officer for the Vote from which the payments are made wouldaccount for the amount paid to each candidate on the basis of the candidate^eligibility claim and declaration of expenses, checked against the records ofthe returning officer.Local Government Candidates10.50 With the re-organisation of local government, candidates in localgovernment elections have been faced with increased expenses and problemsof communication arising from the larger electoral areas. The low level of turn-out in local government elections also makes stale aid at this level particularly important at the present time as a stimulus to wider participation and interest.We accordingly recommend that a scheme for limited reimbursement of election expenses should also be introduced for local government candidates.Basis of entitlement10.51 Under this scheme, candidates in local government elections, that iselections for county and district councils in England and Wales, regional,island and district councils in Scotland, the Greater London Council, the Londonborough councils and the Common Council of the City of London would be eligible, if they polled a certain proportion of the votes cast, for the reimburse-ment of their actual expenses up to a prescribed limit. We do not recommend the extension of this scheme to elections for parish or community councils.The cost of administering such an extended scheme, and the small individualsums involved, would outweigh any likely benefits. If a candidate standing at alocal government election within the scope of the proposed reimbursementscheme was also standing on the same day for election to a parish or communitycouncil, only that part of his expenses relating to his eligible candidature shouldbe taken into account for reimbursement purposes.10.52 In Northern Ireland local government elections are based on a system of proportional representation. It would therefore be inappropriate for thescheme we recommend with regard to local government elections for the rest ofthe United Kingdom to be adopted in Northern Ireland without modification.We recommend that consideration should be given to the adaptation of our proposals to cover district council elections in Northern Ireland.10.53 No deposits are required in local government elections. Consequentlywe have had to decide on some minimum qualification of electoral support. Itseems reasonable to require candidates to qualify on the same basis as Parlia-mentary candidates. Accordingly, we recommend that candidates, to be eligible
for reimbursement, should have polled at least one-eighth of the votes cast.In electoral areas which have a number of seats, as in some district councils,the total votes cast in the area should be divided by the number of seats beingcontested and the candidate should nave potted at least one-eighth of the resultingsum. Otherwise, since parties normally put forward more than one candidatein a multi-member area, the threshold qualification for individual candidates insuch areas would effectively be much higher than in single-member areas.Extent of reimbursement10.54 The amount reimbursable should again be the candidate^ actualelection expenses subject to a limit of half his legally permitted maximumexpenditure.Cost10.55 The present maximum permitted expenditure for each local governmentcandidate is: the Greater London Council,  200 plus 5p for every 4 electors;for other relevant local government areas,  45 plus Ip for every elector. Wehave looked at recent election results in the Greater London Council, London boroughs and a small sample of counties and districts. The ratio of candidateswho won at least one-eighth of the votes cast to the number of seats was approximately: Counties: 2:1; Districts: 2:1; GLC: 2-4:1; London Boroughs:2-3:1. On this basis the approximate number of candidates likely to win atleast one-eighth of the poll in the various elections would be:Counties (England and Wales)Districts (England and Wales)Regions and Islands (Scotland)Districts (Scotland)GLCLondon Boroughs4,303 seats- 8,606 Candidates17,582 seats-35,164507 seats- 1,0141,116 seats- 2,23292 seats-   2211,867 seats- 4,29410.56 On the basis of these figures, we estimate that, ignoring by-elections,the total number of local government candidates qualifying for reimbursementover a four-year period would be about 52,000, and that their total annualmaximum permissible expenditure would be on average about  1 million.Under our proposals reimbursement would be limited to a maximum of halfof this. Assuming that qualifying candidates spent at least this amount, theestimated maximum cost of reimbursement would be in the region of  500,000a year.10.57 Local elections are at present financed from the rates, although theexpenditure qualifies for rate support grant. It could be argued therefore thatany scheme for reimbursement of local government candidates&apos; election expensesshould be financed in the same way. On the other hand, schemes of state aidcan be regarded as relating to the whole system of parliamentary democracy,nationally and locally, and therefore chargeable to central funds. This is amatter which falls to be decided by Parliament.
Administrative arrangements10.58 The statutory requirements, set out in paragraph 10.45, concerning theappointment of agents, the Inrritation of expenses to a maximum and to certainprescribed items, the declaration before a Justice of the Peace, and the availability of the declarations for inspection apply to local government electionsas to Parliamentary elections.10.59 The claim for reimbursement would be made by the candidate to theappropriate officer of the local authority who would check the claim againstthe returning officers list of candidates, votes cast, and declaration of expenses.Payment would be made directly to the candidate.Elections to Assemblies and European Parliament10.60 We recommend that if a scheme of reimbursement of election expensesis adopted, it should be extended to cover any elections to the Scottish and welsh Assemblies. We assume that somewhat similar electoral procedureswill apply. If deposits are not required, candidates should be required to pollone-eighth of the votes cast, with necessary adjustments for two-member constituencies in order to be eligible for reimbursement.10.61 It has been suggested that the e.c. may help with the cost of directelections to the European Parliament. Whether or not this is so, any suchhelp would probably be granted solely towards the expenses of the electoralmachinery eg returning officers&apos; expenses. We therefore recommend that ourscheme of reimbursement of Parliamentary election expenses should, as necessary, be extended to candidates for any direct elections to the european parliament.Date of Commencement10.62 We recommend that legislation to provide for the implementation of theschemes proposed in this Chapter should be introduced as soon as possible.Our scheme for the limited reimbursement of candidates&apos; election expensesshould operate for all relevant Parliamentary and local government electionsheld on or after 1 April 1977. The first payment of the proposed annual grants should be made on 1 April 1977 and quarterly thereafter.
CONCLUSIONS11.1 It is disappointing not to be able to present a unanimous Report, thoughour differences of opinion will cause no surprise. They will doubtless be reflected in the political and public debate which is likely to follow.11.2 We have done our best and it is now for Parliament to decide. It is desirableto avoid undue delay in coming to conclusions. All political parties face financial problems and the sooner they know where they stand the better. We have pressed on with our Report in the hope of being in time for discussions at the partyconferences in the autumn. We are sure that the need to reach early decisionsis fully realised.11.3 We wish to thank our secretariat for their devoted services throughoutour enquiry. To Miss Dora Pease, our secretary until a few weeks ago, werecord our warmest thanks for her unfailing efficiency, devotion to our work, andunsparing attention to our many requirements.11.4 Mr Michael Townley succeeded Miss Pease when she had to leave for family reasons. He undertook with conspicuous success the daunting task ofassimilating the results of a year&apos;s work and of helping us through the intensivefinal phase of the Report. We are most grateful to him.11.5 Mr Geoffrey Griffiths and Miss Beryl Mortimer have been inconstantand cheerful attendance coping with the weight of administration of continuoussessions for fourteen months. We thank them too.11.6 We have welcomed the opportunity of studying this important aspect ofour parliamentary system, in which we all firmly believe. All of us, of whatevershade of opinion, have one aim in common which is to promote the strengthand effectiveness of our parliamentary democracy.
NOTE OF RESERVATION by SIR EDMUND COMPTON1. My reservation relates to the scale on which the parties should be expectedto increase their activities. As stated in paragraph 3.6 of the Report, the parties are an essential feature of our system of Parliamentary democracy, and it makesfor the health of the system that they should have the means to perform their role effectively. But I have reservations about an assessment of that role thatleads to the judgement that &quot;to be effective in the context of the expanded role of modern government, the parties need to raise their sights, widen their vision,and greatly expand their efforts and resources&quot;(paragntph 9.4), with the implications-tioB that &quot;we might accordingly have recommended committing really sub-stantial resources to improving the quality of the political parties&apos; performancein Britain&quot; (paragraph 9.5).2. I have no reservation, however, about the judgement on which the recom-roendations of the majority are actually based, namely that the working ofParliamentary democracy would be seriously hampered if the performance ofthe parties were to fall below a minimum level of activity and efficiency (para-graph 9.6), and that a &quot;modest injection of state aid is the best, and perhaps theonly, way of arresting the run-down of the parties, and of starting the process by which their effectiveness can be raised to an adequate level&quot; (paragraph 9.17);and I join the majority in recommending that the amount of state aid on theminimal basis should be no more than about 20% of the combined annualcentral and constituency incomes of the parties, the annual sum being of theorder of  2 million (paragraph 9.21).3. As to methods of payment of state aid, I appreciate the arguments of the minority in favour of confining Exchequer support to &quot;candidates in the field&quot;(Minority Report, paragraph 7), and would have wished if possible to excludedirect Exchequer grants to party headquarters. But it has to be recognised thatif state aid were only to be provided by the scheme for a limited reimbursement of the election expenses of parliamentary and local government candidates, as described in (paragraphs 10.38-59), the amount of aid so given would fall far short of the addition to the parties&apos; resources that I, with the majority, believe to be required on the minimal basis. Therefore I join in recommending, as wellas the partial reimbursement of election expenses, the scheme for annual grants to parties for their general purposes, as described in paragraphs 10.20-37. in doing so, I would place special emphasis on the importance of requiring partiesso assisted to comply with the conditions of public accountability for which ourscheme provides.
MINORITY REPORT by MR I AITKEN, SIR TATTON BRINTON,MR J HAVTLAND and PROFESSOR D N MacCORMICK1. The four members of the minority make no apology for submitting adissenting conclusion on the difficult and complex question which was placed before the Committee. Although we share with the majority a feeling of regret that we were unable to reach a unanimous verdict, it quickly became apparentin the drafting stages of the Committee^ work that the differences between us and our colleagues in the majority group are not about matters of detail butabout the diagnosis, the prognosis and the prescription. We wish fully to associated -ate ourselves with the majority of the Committee in their expressions of gratitude to all who gave evidence to the Committee or assisted it in other ways and above all to the secretariat of the Committee: Miss Pease, Mr Townley, Mr Griffithsand Miss Mortimer. We wish also to thank the Chairman and our other colleagues for the friendly and co-operative spirit in which all our deliberationstook place, even when it became clear that there could not be an agreed final report.2. Although it is true that no member of either group on the Committee has expressed total opposition to the provision of any form of state assistance tothe political process in any circumstances whatever, we reached the conclusionthat the weight of the evidence did not justify a recommendation in favour ofstate aid in present circumstances. It should be noted, however, that the minoritydoes not dissent from the expository material in Chapters 1 to 8. Nor do wedissent from the descriptions of the two schemes of state aid which the Com-mittee as a whole found most worthy of attention. We agreed with our colleagues in the majority group that the two schemes outlined in Chapter 10 represent by far the best and fairest means by which taxpayers&apos; money could be deployed,either directly to political parties or indirectly through the electoral system.We also agree with their reasons for rejecting a variety of other schemes, andthat they should be dismissed from further consideration. We wish it to be clearly understood, however, that this highly qualified endorsement is givenonly on the strictly hypothetical basis that, if there is to be state aid of onekind or the other, these two systems are the best available, presenting fewerdangers than any of the others considered by the Committee.3. Our dissent is partly explained by the fact that our conception of the nature and role of political parties differs, perhaps fundamentally, from that of our colleagues as described in Chapter 9. There may well be, as they argue, a&quot;minimum, level of activity and efficiency&apos;&apos; for parties, below which they cannotfall without hampering the working of democracy, but we do not consider thatit is possible to determine what that level may be, or whether it would be thesame for all parties, or to measure the parties&apos; shortfall, or to calculate theresources they require. Indeed, we think it mistaken and possibly dangerous tosuggest that any work can be required of a political party by the State, byParliament or by anyone other than its members. We accept the importance ofthe survival of political parties though not necessarily the present ones if our existing system of parliamentary government is to continue in its currentform. But we do not believe that political parties represent more than one amongthe several pillars which support our parliamentary democracy. It is the com-commitment of the British electorate to parliamentary democracy, and its willingness
to work it, which ultimately sustains the system; the parties are part of theexpression of that commitment and that willingness. We therefore cannot accept the majority&apos;s view that the parties are the &quot;mainspring of all the pro-cesses of democracy&quot;. But even if they were, our approach has been that theinjection of large sums of state money into our essentially voluntary system of party politics is so grave a departure from historical practice as to represent,in itself, a threat to that system. We believe that such a risk could only be justifiedif it could be shown that parliamentary democracy was in danger because ofthe imminent bankruptcy of the major political parties. We do not considerthat the evidence placed before the Committee (particularly the survey of centralparty finances Annex fi) suggests that this position either exists now or islikely to exist in the near future. It is worth noting, in this connection, that themajority does not differ from us on this point; their recommendations are notbased on any assertion of acute financial need.4. We acknowledge that additional financial burdens are likely to be placedon the parties if the proposed legislation to establish elected assemblies inScotland and Wales reaches the statute book next year, and if Britain fulfilsits obligation to adopt direct elections for the European Parliament. But webelieve that traditional sources of funds will be capable of meeting the extra cost of party politics, especially in the light of the extremely low level of Britishparty subscriptions. If this optimism proves to be misplaced, the minoritygroup believes strongly that direct aid in the form of annual grants to nationalparty headquarters should be avoided at all costs, and that state assistance tothe political process should be exclusively directed to the point at which theadditional cost arises-namely, the expenses of candidates participating inelections.5. The minority group recognises that its hostility to direct aid may stemfrom what one witness described as a &quot;gut reaction&quot;. They have preferredthis phrase to the more elegant expression &quot;a matter of principle&apos;&apos; on thegrounds that experience has shown that one kind of principle can be over-riddenby another in the normal practice of politics. The rescue of parliamentarydemocracy from imminent collapse would undoubtedly be such an over-ridingprinciple in this case, if it could be shown to be at stake. In the absence ofevidence that it is, the minority believes that there are overwhelming arguments against a direct state subsidy which apply to the immediate circumstances ofthe present, together with others which apply more generally. The immediatearguments can be summarised as follows:CO The current financial difficulties of the parties are due in part toinflation and in part to the accident of two costly general elections inthe single year of 1974. It seems to the minority that it would be wrong to take a highly contentious and probably irreversible step simply to meet a situation which is quite likely to be temporary. Despitesome fashionable gloomy views (some of which are reflected in themajority report) Britain&apos;s current crisis is in our view economicrather than political, and the most effective solution to the difficultiesof the parties would be an improvement in the general state of theTVT
economy. That is an aim to which all the mainstream parties havegiven first priority.(ii) Besides forcing painful economies on the party machines, the nationseconomic difficulties are imposing severe financial restraints on all forms of public and private expenditure. There is no justification forcushioning political parties from the impact of the crisis, and theremay even be a case for allowing them to experience it in full. In parti-cular, it would be morally offensive to provide them with a statesubsidy at a time when programmes of vital social and environmentalimportance are being drastically cut, and when the Government isfacing heavy pressure for still more painful and immediate cuts. ThePrime Minister has said more than once that there can be no initiation of new expenditure while the crisis persists. It is inconceivable to us that the Government could make an exception for the party organisa-tions at a time when, to take just one example, it is apparently im-possible to preserve a world famous women&apos;s hospital like the ElizabethGarrett Anderson Hospital.(iii) Though it is risky to try to interpret the minds of the ministers whoset up this Committee, it is probably safe to assume that the immediatestimulus was the expectation of a severe financial crisis in the LabourParty and a somewhat less severe one in the Conservative Party.Subsequent analysis of the figures supplied by the parties have not supported this doomsday view of the situation in Smith Square,and it is arguable that the Conservative Party&apos;s heavy reliance onfluctuating corporate donations rather than dependable subscriptionsand affiliation fees has now placed it in a slightly more vulnerableposition than the Labour Party. Yet the Conservative Party has consistently proclaimed its opposition to state aid in any form. Itwould be peculiar, to say the least, to offer them money which theypersist in saying they neither need nor want; it would be even morepeculiar (not to say distasteful to Conservative-minded taxpayers)to go ahead with state aid for the Labour and Liberal parties if the conservatives declined to accept their share a situation which mayvery well develop.(iv) The Liberal Parry is undeniably in a chronically worse financialposition than either of the other two major United Kingdom parties.Its own scheme for state aid, which it has placed before the Committeein detail, seems to the minority to be wildly more ambitious than any-thing the Committee could or should recommend. Though acutelyconscious of Liberal poverty, we regretfully conclude that there is no way in which we could justify proposing a nation-wide scheme ofstate aid solely in order to meet the needs of the Liberal Parry. Inthis context, we note that the Scottish National Party and PlaidCymru arc firmly opposed to state aid and prefer to rely upon the enthusiasm of their members to sustain them. The Liberal Partynaturally looks to electoral reform as the real source of its eventualsalvation, but the recommendation of such reforms is no part of this
Committees business. We also note that, even among the Liberals,the Scottish Liberal Party has declared against state aid.6. The more general arguments against state aid can be summarised asfollows:(i) Direct state aid would breach the established British constitutional practice that organisation for political ends is a strictly voluntaryactivity. Even voting is not yet compulsory, and to compel taxpayersto finance political parties with which they have no sympathy would undoubtedly antagonise a large number of citizens. The antagonismwould amount to outrage in many cases if the aid were to extend, let us say, to the Communist Party, the Trotskyists or the National Front.Moreover, those who are worried about a threat posed by theseextremist groups cannot argue that they are too insignificant to qualify for aid under any realistic scheme, The recent rapid advance of theNational Front has shown that this need not always be so. Yet to&quot;rig&quot; the system to exclude these and other more-or-less extremistgroups would be an even graver offence against democratic practice and the simple rules of fairness.(ii) Political parties have always been short of funds, and have habituallyclaimed to need more money to fulfil their functions and extend their activities. But there can be no guarantee that the provision of statemoney would of itself &quot;improve&quot; the performance of parties, particu-larly if there is to be no public answerability for its use. Moreover,quite apart from the oddity of choosing an economic crisis as an appropriate moment to &quot;improve&quot; the performance of politicalorganisations, the very activity of raising money has always been recognised as one of the cohesive forces holding parties together.There is a basic inconsistency in arguing that a state subsidy wouldrelease party workers for &quot;more productive activity&quot; while alsoclaiming that it would have no harmful effect on the flow of voluntary contributions. Both propositions cannot be true at the same time, andthe minority group is inclined to believe that, in spite of the claims forthe European experience, it would be the voluntary contributions whichwould suffer. This would probably be felt most severely by theConservative Party, partly because of its dependence on donationsfrom individuals and companies as a major source of its headquartersincome, but even more because of the relatively high proportionof its overall income which is derived from voluntary fund raising inthe constituencies.(iii) Direct state aid would tend to weaken the links between political parties and their traditional sources of support. Indeed, many of the mostenthusiastic supporters of state aid cheerfully advance this argumentas a positive benefit, believing that it would diminish the element of confrontation in British political life and lead to a-greater degree ofconsensus between the parties. The argument is usually associatedwith a belief in radical electoral reform and progress towards coalition government on the European pattern. It is an attractive case, provided
one believes in the other elements too. But the Committee as a whole has reached agreement on the proposition that its recommendations should not attempt to reshape the British party political system, andshould be designed as far as possible to be neutral in matters of constitutional practice a subject which in any case has no place inour terms of reference. Moreover, the minority group believes thatany tampering with traditional party alignments, even by accident,would be profoundly mistaken. The existing alignments reflect a degree of actual conflict in society, and to that extent any attempt todistort it would threaten to drive those left wing and right wing elementswhich currently stay within the mainstream of party politics into extra-parliamentary activity of a potentially dangerous kind. It is almost certainly true that the existence of the Labour Party as a broadalliance covering the whole territory from the centre leftwards hasprotected Britain from any significant Communist or ultra-leftchallenge on the French or Italian pattern. It is probably also true thatthe breadth of the Conservative Party appeal has had a similar influence on the politics of the right.(iv) There is no evidence that the dependence of the Labour andConservative parties on institutional support from the trade unions and industry has distorted their overall political direction. On thecontrary, it can be argued that the two parties exist to representthese legitimate interests, among others, and that they attract thefinancial support of industry and the trade unions precisely becausethey do. It was the trade unions which founded the Labour Party;they remain an integral part of it, and the affiliation fees which theypay to it must therefore be sharply distinguished not only from individual membership subscriptions but also from &quot;donations&quot;.But the Committee was unanimous that there should be no attemptto ban institutional contributions and donations, or to limit theiramount. Indeed, even if a successful attempt were to be made alongthese lines, it is certain that the trade unions would -continue to be a powerful force in the Labour Party, and equally that the conservative party would continue to reflect the interests. of free enterprise and private industry. Should the financial dependence of either party onsectional interests ever lead to a serious narrowing of its appeal, then the electorate can.be counted upon to provide the appropriatedemocratic antidote. We are also sceptical about the concept ofpublic money as in some way laundered, and therefore &quot;neutral&quot;.On the contrary, we find it as dubious as the concept of a free lunch.It is only a short step from the injection of state funds to direct demands on the party organisations for a quid pro quo in the form of radical changes in their rules and practices. There may be a case for this ina different context but such a development would be a long way fromneutrality.(v) Direct subsidies to the national headquarters of the parties would greatly strengthen the central organisations at the expense of the rank and file in the constituencies at a time when all the pressure
is in the opposite direction. It is arguable that this might not be tooharmful in the Labour Party, at least under its present management,since it draws its extra-parliamentary leadership by election from a delegate conference. But there have been times, even in the LabourParty, when these checks have been inflective, and they could wellreturn. The Conservative Party is already heavily centralised in the sense that its national organisation and research agency is virtuallycontrolled by the party leader in the Commons, and the provisionof an independent source of so-called &quot;neutral&quot; money could onlyincrease the centralisation.(vi) Cynicism about politics and politicians is already at an alarminglyhigh level, partly because of the inability of successive governments to solve britain&apos;s economic problems, but partly because of alengthening series of financial scandals involving political personalitiesat national and (more often) local level. The sight of political repre-sentatives at Westminster voting substantial sums of public moneyto their parties could only deepen this cynicism still further. the minority group is somewhat sceptical about the weight that can beplaced on the findings of the social survey conmussioned by theCommittee, because the method of questioning which had to beadopted sought an &quot;informed&quot; response from the small sample whichwas interviewed. When, or if, a system of state aid is adopted, it is highly unlikely that the public in general will react in an equally&quot;informed&quot; way.(vii) The practices of the four European countries which the Committeehad the good fortune to visit seem to the minority to have little,if any, relevance to British experience. Sweden, in spite of a relativelylong and successful history of parliamentary democracy, operates itssystem of state subsidies against a background of vastly greatereconomic prosperity; moreover, the opulence of its aid, not to mention the extent to which its parties have become dependent on it,if enormously greater than anything this Committee could or wouldrexxammend. Neither Austria nor West Germany has more than a brief uninterrupted experience of true parliamentary democracy,and it is probable that one of the underlying reasons for introducingstate aid is a desire to provide a reliable clockwork driving force for the new machine until it has become more securely established.Holland, where some members of the Committee felt most at home,has yet to decide in favour of direct aid and has so far only experi-mented with a somewhat ghostly system of indirect aid to institutesfor research and education. The claims made for the Dutch institutesystem were by no means grandiose, and more than one distinguishedpolitician and academic in Holland was unaware even of the existenceof the educational bodies.(viii) All members of the Committee, majority as well as minority, havebeen at pains to avoid the danger of ossifying the existing party political structure by bolstering the established parties at the expense
of emerging groups. But there is an equal and opposite risk of over-compensation in the effort to construct a strictly neutral system. Thedanger here js of providing emerging parties with a new, whollyartificial and continuing stimulus once they have passed the qualifyingthreshold which is a feature of almost every practical scheme of aid.Recent experience suggests that the National Front could well become a beneficiary in the very near future.7. The arguments above summarise the factual and logical case against stateaid, even if much of the minority group*s opposition is founded on a simpledistaste for what we regard as a dangerous and irreversible departure fromBritish constitutional practice. However, we accept that a sharp deterioration in the financial viability of the parties might justify a re-examination nf thecase. Should any future government conclude that the situation had becomecritical, and that a genuine rescue operation was essential, we believe strongly that it should direct its attention to a scheme of indirect aid channelled to candidates in the field rather than to a system of block grants to party head-quarters. Such a scheme is described in the second half of Chapter 10, andwould involve the reimbursement of a proportion of the legally allowableelection expenses of each candidate who saves his deposit or its equivalentIt could easily be applied not only to Westminster elections but also to elections for the European Parliament, the Scottish and Welsh Assemblies, and evencounty and district elections. The overriding advantage of this approach overblock aid to parties at the centre is that it would be a subsidy to the electoralsystem, and would therefore represent direct aid to the democratic process byassisting voters to make an informed choice between candidates. The bulkof the funds thus provided would of course find their way into parry coffers,but this could be regarded as a legitimate reimbursement for a valuable and necessary service to the electorate. Such a scheme would be in line with historicBritish practice in this field, which has always concentrated state aid to thepolitical process outside Westminster on measures which have helped the electorate to know who and what they are being asked to vote for, and whereand when to vote. This is demonstrably true of those subsidies which, in theview of some of our witnesses, have already established &quot;the principle&quot; of stateaid namely, the provision of free postal facilities and the delivery of pollingcards during general elections, and the allocation of free television and radiofacilities to the parties during and between campaigns. Members of the minoritytherefore believe that some such system would involve far fewer serious risksthan a scheme of block grants, and could well be kept in reserve against anyserious deterioration in the situation in the future.8. Finally, and with some diffidence, we would like to offer a warning. Themajority fairly insists that it is proposing no more than a modest injection of funds, largely in the nature of a shot in the arm designed to stimulate renewedactivity. But we believe that the experience of European countries confirmsthat state aid, once started, never diminishes and almost always increases.As one distinguished Swedish politician told us, in what was intended to be apiece of helpful advice: &quot;start small-you can always increase it later&quot;.

GUIDELINES SENT BY THE COMMITTEE TO THOSE SUBMITTINGWRITTEN EVIDENCE1. It may be helpful for those giving evidence to have an idea of the questions the Committee has under review.2. The terms of reference of the Committee are as follows: &quot;To considerwhether, in the interests of parliamentary democracy, provision should be made from public funds to assist political parties in carrying out their functions outsideParliament; to examine the practice of other parliamentary democracies in this field; and to make recommendations as to the scope of political activities towhich any such provision should relate and the method of its allocation.&quot;3. These terms cover a wide field: they include both Northern Ireland and localgovernment. The Committee is looking at the aspects listed below, and would welcome information or comments you may have on those of particular interestto you. The list is not exhaustive; nor is it meant to be restrictive. comments on any matters of relevance will be helpful. You may find of use a discussion ofthe whole subject in a recently published book &quot;The Problem of Party Govem-ment&quot; by Professor Richard Rose, Macmillan, 1974, especially chapters 9 and 10.A Factual InformatirjoThis section is primarily for the political parties to answer, since only they arelikely to have the information needed. The Committee wishes to find out howparties have got into their present difficulties, just what these difficulties are andwhether they were causing anxiety before the sharp rise in the rate of inflation.Information in the following categories or some other equivalent classificationwill be helpful.For each party:(i) membership trends over, say, 10 years;(ii) income(a) national(6) constituencylisting the amounts or estimated proportions from donations-affiliation fees membership subscriptions sale of literature lotteries, football pools, etc other eg bazaars, fetes, coffee mornings, etc.and if possible giving figures over several years to demonstrate trends;(iii) expenditure(a) national(ft) constituency
 salaries postage, accommodation etc publications other (specify)Indicating any changes over past years and demonstrating trends;(iv) flow of funds between different parts of party, eg constituency andheadquarters,(v) expenditure on and trends in staffing at headquarters and constituencylevel, by function eg balance between agents, research workers,publicity and information staff, administrative staff, etc;(vi) any other relevant trends (with measurements where possible) eg: expenditure on general and local authority elections constituency activities balance of voluntary/paid work.B Future ProspectsThe Committee is also concerned with what the future holds and how parties,Parliament, local authorities and the political structure generally, may be expectation-ted to develop, with or without some financial aid to parties. We hope it is not necessary to contemplate inflation at anything like the present rate, though rising costs are bound to come into the picture. Since much of such forecasting isguesswork, the Committee would find useful opinions on these aspects from all who feel able to give them.(i) forecasts of future income, expenditure, membership trends, activities,etc for each party;(ii) possible effects of devolution eg of elected assemblies in Wales orScotland;(iii) possible effects of membership of e.c. and European Assembly.C ExpreasiotM of OpinionThis section contains questions which the Committee must attempt to answeraffecting as they do the basic philosophy and the value.judgements in any recommendations. Opinions are bound to be subjective here and for that reason the Committee will welcome yours.(i) the functions of political parties; whether the United Kingdom could do without political parties as now organised;(ii) whether, and if so, how far, the interests of parliamentary democracyare being damaged by shortage of money in the parties; what desirablework is not being done;(iii) whether present funds are used effectively; what activities will be curtailed if shortages continue;
(iv) reasons for the present difficulties in raising money; whether falling off of interest by industry and/or trade unions;(v) reasons for the alleged decline in membership; whether membershipimportant; what attempts made to increase membership;(vi) how active constituency parties should be; whether there should be full-time or part-time agents in every constituency;(vii) how necessary are research activities in each party; what &quot;research&quot;actually consists of; what improvement could more money bring;(viii) how much parties should cost at current prices-^n total or byactivities; whether ways of raising more money, other than gettingGovernment aid, have been fully explored; whether donations shouldbe exempted from tax; what &quot;easy payment&quot; methods could be devised to raise money from eg small subscribers;(ix) what, if any, other ways there are of &quot;helping&quot; political parties inthe interests of parliamentary democracy;(x) in what, if any, ways the interests of parliamentary democracy mightbe damaged or put at risk by the provision of money for political parties out of public funds; in what, if any, ways it would be possibleto guard against such risks.D  Special Aspects of InterestThis section refers to special aspects of interest to particular parties which theCommittee must look at; factual information and examples will be useful.(i) the importance to the trade unions/Labour Party of the practice ofsponsoring candidates and the political levy; possible effect on national or local policies;(ii) the basis on which the political levy is collected and the basis onwhich affiliation fees are paid to the Labour Party, the difference in numbers between the two; and the justification for it;(iii) the importance to business/Conservative Party of donations from industry; possible effect oa national or local policies;(iv) the importance of Aims of Industry and other groups in thisconnection.E If Money Given From Public FindsIt is clear that different ways of using public funds to help political parties are practised in a number of countries. Whatever the Committee may recom-mend one way or the other, it is likely to examine possible methods of financialassistance suited to the particular political, social and governmental circura-stances in the United Kingdom. Your views would be helpful.(i) where money should come fcom-exchequer, rates, allocation by individuals of part of income tax to &quot;a political fund&quot; (on lines ofUSA presidential campaign fund);(ii) the extent, if any, to which it should be made conditional on support from other sources, eg subscriptions, donations or contributions, beingrefused or prohibited;
(iii) the amount needed for each party; whether given at constituencyand/or national level;(iv) whether and what conditions should be attached eg given for expendi-ture on particular activities agents&apos; salaries, educational work,research; or made conditional on particular organisational aspectseg specified procedures for selecting parliamentary candidates; orlimited to reimbursement of election expenses;(v) how money should be allocated; by number of votes in general elections; number of MPa; flat rate; linked to amounts raised fromother sources eg on a   for   basis; whether some at least should begiven in connection with elections for local authorities and other bodies;(vi) whether ceilings should be imposed on total expenditure of each party;(vii) grants from public funds would possibly be subject to some form ofaudit and report to Parliament: would this be acceptable; whetheraccounts of party income and expenditure should be published;(viii) how far experience of the practice in other countries is relevant to united Kingdom circumstances.
ANNEX BFINANCIAL STATE OF THE PARTIES AT THE CENTRE1. This Annex contains details of the main parties&apos; central finances over theperiod 1967 to 1976. The parties submitted returns of income, expenditure and reserves, presented as far as possible under certain broad headings. In orderto highlight trends the figures have been recast in terms of constant (1970)prices; a note explaining how this was done is included as an Appendix.2. It was not possible for the parties to provide the information in identicalform, and some inconsistencies in presentation were therefore unavoidable.The main differences are as follows:(a) the Welsh Liberal Party, the Scottish National Party and PlaidCymru did not provide figures for the years prior to 1970;(A) the Scottish Conservative Party were unable to provide information about reserves or analyses of income and expenditure; -.(c) the Communist Party submitted two-yearly returns of income andexpenditure and no information about reserves;(d) the 1975 figures for the Labour and Liberal parties are provisional;(e) the Liberal Party was unable to provide an analysis of income andexpenditure for 1975.3. Amounts have been expressed to the nearest   thousand; because of thisrounding, figures under the separate headings do not always add up exactly tothe totals shown.

Note on the figures and graphs of party income, expenditure and reserves at constant (1970) prices.hifroducaon1. This note explains how the figures from the parties&apos; central accounts for1967-1976 have been expressed in terms of constant prices that is to say,how they have been &quot;deflated&quot; so as to reflect 1970 prices rather than the actualprices of the year in question. It is convenient to begin by dealing separatelywith salaries etc, which represent a separate heading in Expenditure Analysis B(described in paragraphs 4.20 and 4.25 of the Report).Salaries, Wages, Employers&apos; National Insurance Contributions etc (EmployeePayments)2. Parties&apos; central employee payments have been deflated primarily by referenceto the Department of Employment annual index numbers of salaries of non-manual employees in all industries in Great Britain, which today relate to april of each year. For the years up to 1970, these figures were supplemented by those for manufacturing industries only, since these used then to be availabletwice a year. Average salary index numbers for 12 months&apos; periods were thenestimated in the light of movements in the Department of Employment monthlyindex numbers of basic wages received by United Kingdom manual workers;it was mainly for 1975 and 1976 that this additional information was used.Within a single 12 months&apos; period, the different index numbers were assumed to have moved more or less in proportion to one another.Other Payments3. The remainder of parties&apos; central expenditure was deflated by means ofspecially calculated price index numbers (deflators) of consumer expenditure,derived from the Central Statistical Office publication &quot;National Income andExpenditure 1964-74&quot;. Their coverage was limited to the items in the list at theend of this Note, ie to those items most likely to figure in office expenditure.The price deflators for these different items were then combined with one another in proportion to their relative importance in aggregate United Kingdom con-suraers&apos; expenditure, during the relevant 12 months&apos; period.4. The deflators thus arrived at were used for the non-salary items in Ex-penditure Analysis B as well as, in the case of the Labour Party, for the &quot;specialexpenditure&quot; items in its Expenditure Analysis A (which included no element of headquarters&apos; salaries), and for the income from its General Election Fund(from which that special expenditure may be assumed to have been largelymet).General5. All these calculations were carried out for calendar years, for financialApril-March years (in order to obtain deflators for the Conservative Party&apos;scentral figures), and for pairs of calendar years (in order to obtain deflators forthe Communist Party&apos;s two-yearly accounts). The resulting deflated figuresfor the Communist Party have normally been spread over the two relevantcalendar years in equal halves.
6. Ia order to be able to deal with items related partly but not wholly toemployee payments, an average price deflator was calculated, separately foreach party and for the 12 (or 24) months&apos; period appropriate to it. This combinedthe deflators for employee payments and for other payments, described above,in the proportions which these two types of spending bore to one another forthe relevant party and period.7. The resulting general deflator was then used for all items in ExpenditureAnalysis A and in the income analysis, except that, for the reasons given inparagraph 4, it was not used for the Labour Party&apos;s special expenditure or forthe income from its General Election Fund.Reserves$. The levels of reserves at the closing dale of each accounting period were also deflated by the general deflators described above, averaging the relevantpairs of deflators for the immediately preceding and following 12 months&apos;periods. Care must therefore be exercised in comparing the resulting figureswith deflated figures of income or expenditure, since the latter are based ondeflators relating to a single year only.List of items of consumer expenditure of which the average price was used todeflate parties&apos; central expenditure, other than employee payments: Fuel and light; furniture and floor coverings; stationery (and other mis-cellaneous non-recreational expenditure); postage, telephone and othercommunication charges; contract cleaning (and other forms of domestic service); insurance; occupiers&apos; expenditure on property maintenance,repairs and improvements;, motor vehicles and their running costs; othertravel; and meals and accommodation away from home.

ANNEX DCONSTITUENCY SURVEY: CHOICE OF SAMPLEPaper prepared by the Central Statistical office. IntroductionA postal sample survey was undertaken by the Committee for the purpose ofgathering information concerning constituency party organisations in GreatBritain (see Chapter 5). This Annex describes the design considerations involvedin selecting the sample of constituencies. The survey needed to cover three main categories of information; membership, staff and activities, and finance; andthe survey was designed accordingly.2.  The deafest2.1   Background to the designConsiderations of time and cost made it necessary to rule out direct inter-viewing of constituency parties, either by the Committee or by professionalinterviewers, in favour of a postal questionnaire; similar considerations res-tricted the enquiry to a sample of the 623 constituencies. An informal pilotsurvey, consisting of 13 constituency parties, was carried out to gather factsneeded for the design of the questionnaire and of the survey. The constituencyparties covered all had associations with members of the Committee. although not from a randomly selected pilot sample, replies received were extremelyhelpful.2.2  The sample sizeAfter some discussion between representatives of the Committee Secretariat,the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, Research Surveys of GreatBritain Ltd (the firm of consultants commissioned to analyse the survey results)and the Central Statistical Office, it was decided, balancing coverage on theone hand against resources available on the other, that the sample would consistof 100 constituencies, taking in each selected constituency every party whichcontested the October 1974 General Election. This was expected to realise about350 constituency parties. In order to have a better chance of obtaining anadequate picture of the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru, over sampling(in proportionate terms) of Scotland and Wales was decided upon. The samplewas to be comprised of 74 constituencies of the 516 in England (approximately in 7), 15 of the 71 constituencies in Scotland (approximately 1 in 5) and 11 ofthe 36 constituencies in Wales (approximately 1 in 3).2.3 The stratificationIf the field to be sampled is first stratified according to factors which are associated with the major variations in the information being sought, then theuse of stratified selection will increase the representativeness of the sampleand the precision of resulting estimates. After grouping the constituencies intohomogeneous strata, one constituency is selected at random from each stratum.The main factors which might influence constituency party organisation, besidesof course the general differences between the parties, were thought to be:(i) geographical location;(ii) county or borough constituency;
(iii) size of the electorate; and(iv) the winning party and the size of its majorityThe relevant information about the factors (ii), (iii) and (iv) for the October 1974General Election is to be found in the House of Commons Return &quot;election expenses&quot;4. The first factor, while of course likely to be of some significancehere, is in any case of almost mandatory importance in a survey of this type inorder to ensure that the sample is geographically representative. Five regionswere used, namely:1. The South East of England (including Greater London);2. The South West, West Midlands, East Midlands and East Anglia;3. North West, Yorkshire and Humberside and North;4. Scotland; and5. Wales.The sub-division of England was chosen to give a fairly natural groupingwith roughly equal numbers of constituencies. The second and third factors,county/borough and electorate, are already established in Law.The Representation of the People Act 1974 lays down the maximum permissibleelection expenditure that may be incurred by a candidate at a parliamentary election. The maximum is specified in terms of whether the constituency iscounty or borough and the number of registered electors. As to the fourthfactor, it is important that the sample should be representative not only bywinning party but also by size of majority because it is possible that partiesmay devote proportionately more resources to constituencies they have a hopeof winning or a fear of losing.3.  Selecting Ae sampleThe stratification scheme was implemented in the following manner. The623 constituencies were assigned according to the 5 geographical regions and county or borough into 10 groups. Within each of these groups the constituencieswere ranked in order from those with the highest electorate to those with the lowest. Each group was then subdivided, the number of sub-groups formedbeing equal to the number of constituencies to be sampled from the group, andthe sub-groups being as nearly as possible of equal size; the constituencies withthe highest electorate formed the first sub-group, and so on. For example thereare 125 constituencies in the first group, which is SE England boroughs, anda sample of 18 was to be chosen; the group was therefore divided into 17 sub-groups of 7 constituencies and one of 6. Within sub-groups the constituencieswere then ranked again in terms of the winning party at the October 1974Election and the winning margin. Safe Labour seats were placed on the left,then marginal Labour, marginal Conservative and safe Conservative on theright. Constituencies represented by one of the nationalist parties or by theLiberal Party were placed in the middle in that order. It is worth noting thatthe double ranking mechanism (first by electorate and then by majority) isonly a device to facilitate the choice of a sample that has proportional representa-tion of the constituencies in terms of the factors electorate size and majoritysize.*HC 478 28 Jury 1975.
The ranking could have been in order of lowest electorate to highest electorate,or some other ordering of the parties, to achieve the same end. Within eachof the re-ranked sub-groups one constituency was selected at random subjectto the constraint that the various positions of ranking were each selected, as nearly as possible, the same number of times, thus ensuring a representativesample.4.  The SampleThe above technique is termed multi-stage stratified random sampling. Inthe chosen sample of 100 constituencies, constituencies which had previously been used in the informal pilot survey were replaced with the most similarconstituency in the same sub-group. The selected sample is listed in Table I.The distribution of the sample in terms of which party won the seats concerned at the 1974 (October) General Election is shown in Table 2 with, for comparison,the figures for the country as a whole and the number expected in the sample.There are no marked disparities. There are IS constituencies in the samplewhere the winning margin at the 1974 (October) General Election was less than2,000, compared with an expected number of 12. The breakdown of these 15marginal constituencies by country is given in Table 3. Finally the geographical distribution of the 100 constituencies in the sample is shown in Fig. 1, the constituencies being shown on the map of Great Britain by the correspondingnumbers used in Table 1. The boundaries of the five regions used for stratificationare shown with pecked mines.

In summary the survey was organised as follows:SamplingThis was undertaken by the Central Statistical Office the universe of constituencies being stratified by region, county/borough, size of winningmargin and electorate size. A small degree of over-sampling was adopted bothin Scotland and Wales, since it was felt that these areas were of particular interest in view of the national party activity.In each selected constituency-100 in all all parties presenting a candidatein the October 1974 election were taken, providing a total of 357. Fuller detailsof the sampling are given in Annex D.QuestionnaireThe information was collected via a self-completion questionnaire, developedfollowing an informal pilot conducted by the Committee Secretariat. A copyof the questionnaire will be found in the appendices to thjs Annex.
ContactCo-operation from central party organisations was obtained by the Secretariatin the case of Labour, Conservative and Liberal Parties, and Plaid Cymruand the Scottish National Party. Lists of names and addresses for local parties were normally provided by the Secretariat but the Conservative Party central office and the Scottish National Party despatched and collected theirquestionnaires themselves.The Communist Party central organisation advised that the survey that is oflocal parties was not relevant to their party structure and provided informationcentrally. Questionnaires were therefore not sent to these parties. Copies of the questionnaire were sent to the headquarters of the National Front and theWorkers&apos; Revolutionary Party with a covering letter and the situation was explained on the telephone but no replies were received.Attempts to locate addresses of minor parties were made on an ad hoc basis the existence of some organisations is of course limited to the period of an election campaign.All contact was organised and undertaken by the Committee Secretariat. Theprime contact was postal a copy of the questionnaire, covering letter andreply paid envelope being sent usually to a named party agent or treasurer.There followed a telephone contact to encourage response and to answer anyqueries. Further such contacts including a reminder letter were made as necessary.Questionnaires were despatched in the week commencing 3rd November andthe eventual closing date for replies was Friday 5th December (it was in factpossible to include one or two questionnaires received after this date, in themain analysis).An analysis of the response rate is shown in Appendix A. Response rates forthe three major parties were: Labour 87% Conservative 82% Liberal 70%.(That is in terms of analysable questionnaires.)Information qualityAn initial check of the completeness of returned questionnaires was made bythe Secretariat and in many instances further telephone calls were made to fill gaps or to resolve ambiguities.It was impossible however to resolve all queries and while some could be adequately dealt with in the coding process, others particularly incompletefinancial data or financial data shown in a form different from that requested,led to questionnaires being rejected.A summary of the nature of rejections is shown in Appendix B. In particular,it was decided that the main analysis would be based on Labour, Conservative
and Liberal party records only, since a combination of low response, incompleterecords and apparently weak local party structures meant that analysis of other parties&apos; returns would be of doubtful value.Coding and AnalysisThis was undertaken by RSGB. Before analysis the sample was weighted tctake into account the oversampling in Scotland and Wales. The weighting was undertaken on the basis of the sample originally selected. No attempt hasbeen made to correct for variations in response rate. The analysis is based on238 Labour, Conservative and Liberal questionnaires. A selection of Summarytables appear in this report.Note on InterpretationThe aim of this survey and of the analysis and reporting of it has been to provideas detailed and reliable a picture as possible of the nature of the operation andfinances of constituency party organisations. It should be remembered that the accuracy of the results reported will be affected by a number of factors, themost important of which are:(0 The Sample achieved.The original sample was drawn in a way so as to maximise its repre-sentations of the universe of constituencies. The sample analysedexcludes a number of organisations who either did not reply, did notreply in sufficient detail or replied too late.In particular there is some under-representation of Labour con-stituency parties in Scotland.The analysis is confined to Labour, Conservative and Liberal.(ii) The ability to provide information requested.Particularly on questions of numbers membership and finance thereis some level of non-response to individual questions, which will affect the overall accuracy. (On occasion this may represent the deliberate withholding of information.)In the analysis of income and expenditure, organisations not replyingin terms of calendar years (both in 1973 and 1974) have been excludedsince it was felt that they would distort the pattern.(iii) Differences in interpretation of questions.This is a problem which relates mainly to the few attitudinal questionsincluded, but may also affect other questions (eg precise definition of membership) to a small extent.Given all these points it is recommended that the results should primarily be interpreted in terms of patterns and trends rather than in absolutes.
1.1.2 Table A shows the overall position for the three main parties combined.It will be seen that at each point in time over two-thirds of constituencies whowere able to give information for the required periods claimed membershipsof 1,000 or less.1.1.stable ASummary of Combined Membership levels of Labour, Conservative and Liberal PartiesBase - 238December197219731974LatestNo of members:0Under 200201-500501-1,0001,001-3,0003.000+No information9%20%20%13%9%17%4%23%24%16%12%9%12%*22%27%19%13%10%8%25%24%20%16%7%8%--Less than 0-5%.1.1.4 These figures must of course be viewed within party, and the growth ofthe Liberal party is particularly relevant to their interpretation. In the twoearlier years the substantial levels of nil membership relate almost entirely toLiberal constituency organisations, presumably not yet formed, or at least notoperating formally.	1972	1973	1974	LatestTotal &quot;O&quot;	22	10	1	1Liberal &quot;O&quot;	18	10	1	-1.1.5 The conversion of these organisations into ones with subscription payingmembers has contributed to an overall improvement in the three party member-ship position. For 1972 only 33% of the constituencies could claim membershipin excess of 500. This figure has risen gradually to 42 % for the &quot;latest&quot; date.1.1.6 The vast majority of Labour constituency organisations have a member-ship of less than 1,000, although there was a small overall tendency for growthbetween 1972 and 1974. (The trend from 1974 to the latest 1975 figures is uncertain because of a rise in the number of constituencies unable to give figures1.  Membership1.1   Membership numbers1.1.1 Constituencies were asked to say how many individual subscriptionpaying members they had at the end of 1972, 1973, 1974 and at the latest avail-able date in 1975.
for that period.) Whilst an eighth of Labour constituency parties claim member-ship of over 1,000 none claims membership of more than 2,000.1.1.7 Conservative constituency parties have on average much higher paidmembership than their Labour counterparts and between 1972 and 1974 thesituation appears relatively stable. Because of a high level of &quot;no information&quot;returns (approaching one-quarter in 1972 and 1973, slightly lower in 1974) thefigures must be interpreted cautiously; of the organisations quoting figures: more than half claim over 1,000 members-about one third claim over 3,000-12-15% claim membership of over 5,000(10-12 organisations of the 82surveyed).The &quot;latest&quot; figures show a number of changes; a decrease in the number with no information; a considerable decrease, from 23-15, in the number with morethan 3,000 members; a largely compensating increase in those with 1,000-3,000members (18-24), and with 500-1,000 members (7-10). Thus there is an overallsuggestion of a shrinkage in membership after 1974.1.1.8 The development of &quot;new&quot; Liberal constituency organisations was notedabove. At the time of the &quot;latest&quot; figures nearly four-fifths of the sample of 69had a membership of less than 500. There was a single organisation with morethan 3,000 members. By this time only 2 were unable to provide informationcompared with 16 for 1972.1.1.9 Both because of varying trends within party, together with fluctuatinglevels of &quot;no information&quot;, and because of the nearness of the last election, it isnot possible to show a clear relationship between membership and elections.Only in the case of the Conservative party is there a suggestion of a fall-off inmembership after the elections of 1974.1.1.10 Membership levels were tabulated against a number of other variableswhich might be related. Though the presence of a paid agent varies considerablyby party (see later) and is so low as to make analysis difficult for Liberal con-stituency organisations, and to an extent for Labour organisations, there is some evidence to suggest a link between agents and high membership. Takingthe &quot;latest&quot; 1975 membership analysis:- Of 22 Labour organisations with a full or part-time paid agent, 6 had more than 1,000 members, compared with only 4 of the 66 organisa-tions without agents,- 28 of the 62 Conservative constituency organisations with full or part-time agents had 2,000 or more members, compared with none of the20 organisations without agents.1.1.11 Relationships between membership and electorate size exist but are relatively slight. About 16% of the 32 smallest constituencies (less than 50,000electors) have more than 1,000 members compared with 21 % of the 73 consti-constituencies with more than 70,000 electors, taking &quot;latest&quot; figures.
1.1.12 Similarly, some relationship is found by analysing membership againstmajority&apos;.		Majority				Total	Las than 3fi00	3,000-6fi99	7000-Ufi99	12,000 or more% of parties having more   than   1,000 members (latest 1973 figures)	23%	28%	22%	23%	12%Thus there is an inference that the more marginal a constituency the stronger theparty organisations it contains will be, in membership terms.1.2 Membership drivesI.2.I Constituencies were asked to answer a direct question &quot;When did youlast have a membership drive&quot; ?1.2.2 12% answered that they held drives &quot;all the time&quot;, while a further 16%were currently holding one. 21 % had held one since September 1975, and asimilar proportion had held one in the six months prior to that date.f Almosttwo-thirds of the organisations had held a drive at some time in 1975.1.2.3 15% of constituency organisations had last held a drive in 1974, 8% in1973 and 8% in 1972 or earlier.1.2.4 There is no significant variation in this activity by party, but there is some evidence that organisations without agents were less likely to have had a drivein 1975 than those with full or part-time agents.	Paid agent	No agent	(full or part-time)	Total Labour, Conservative and Liberal ccganisa-	89	149tions		% whose last drive was before 1975	29%	35%1.2.5 Size of electorate does affect the recency of a membership drive: 13 of the32 organisations in constituencies of less than 50,000 electors (41 %) did not havea drive in 1975, compared with 46 of 133 organisations in 50,000-70,000electorateconstituencies (35%), and only 17 of the 73 largest constituencies (23%).1.2.6 Organisations in constituencies with larger majorities are somewhat less likely to have held a 1975 membership drive than those in more marginalconstituencies.* ie between winning and second party.f Some double counting arises because of organisations with drives which span severalperiods.
1.2.7 Analysis by membership&quot; shows a split in the activity of largest party organisations while a high proportion have had a very recent drive, there arealso a significant number with no drive at all during 1975.	1974 Membership		Last drive	Less than 200	201-1500	More than 1,500Since September 197S	36%	53%	58%Before 1975	39%	26%	40%    -1.2.8 Canvassing was the main method used-by 82% of the organisations)letters and leaflets were used by 62 % and meetings held by 22 %. Other can-vassing approaches were insignificant.1.2.9 There is a roughly equal split between those who are satisfied to an extentwith the results of the drive (47 %) and those who are dissatisfied (50 %).1.2.10 Conservative organisations were a little more likely to be satisfied (55%)than their Labour and Liberal counterparts (44% and 43 % respectively).1.2.11 There is apparently a much higher level of satisfaction with the drivesheld in Southern England (64%) than in other parts of the country (37% on average).1.2.12 Perhaps unsurprisingly, 54 % of winning party organisations claim to besatisfied to an extent, compared with 44 % of losing organisations.1.3  Satisfaction with current membership1.3.1 Constituencies were asked whether their current membership figures were very satisfactory, satisfactory, unsatisfactory or very unsatisfactory.1.3.2 Not a single organisation thought the figures to be &quot;very satisfactory&quot;,while 11% answered &quot;satisfactory&quot;, 58% &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; and 31% &quot;very unsatisfactory&quot;.1.3.3 Organisations with full or part-time paid agents are rather more likely tobe satisfied than those without.1.3.4 As would be expected organisations having a larger membership and 1974winners were more likely to express satisfaction, than others.*I974 claims.
2.  Staff and activity2.1   Paid secretary or agent2.1.1 One quarter of the constituency organisations (26%) have a full-timepaid secretary or agent, while a further 12% have the services of a part-timesecretary/agent or one shared with another constituency or borough organisa-tion. The remaining three-fifths of the sample had no paid official acting in this capacity.2.1.2 There is a considerable variation by party; over half the Conservativeconstituencies have a full-time agent, compared with 16% of Labour organisa-tions, and 3 % of Liberal (ie 2 constituencies of the 69 analysed). Only a quarterof Conservative organisations are without a full or part-time agent (Labourthree-quarters, Liberal nine-tenths).2.1.3 There is a positive relationship between presence of an agent and electionvictory (October 1974).

Constituency organisationswith large memberships are, unsurprisingly, much more likely to have a full-time agent than smaller organisations (we saw in Section 1 that Conservativeorganisations tended to be larger than Labour or Liberal ones).2.1.5 &apos;Marginal&apos; constituency organisations were more likely to have a full-time agent than safe ones:	Majority			Under 3000	3,000-11^99	12,000 or moreFull-time agent	40%	24%	13%2.1.6 A majority of constituencies with a full or part-time agent, pay the salary from constituency funds (64%). Only a small proportion of agents (11 %)are paid directly or indirectly from party headquarters. The remainder-a quarter have their salary paid by some combination of constituency andheadquarters funds.
2.2  Other full-time staff2.2.1 Less than one in five constituencies employed any other full-time staff(17%), and almost all of these are employed by Conservative organisations(37 of 40). Only in 4 cases is more than one additional worker employed.2-2.2 As many as two-thirds of Conservative constituencies with a full-timeagent have an additional full-time official.2.2.3 Three-quarters of Labour organisations employ neither a full or part-time agent/secretary nor any other full-time staff, compared with less thanone-quarter of Conservative constituency organisations.2.2.4 Almost all these additional full-time workers were typists or secretaries.2.2.5 In addition to the above just under one-fifth (19%) of constituenciesshared the services of other full-time staff with city, borough or regional organisations. In the case of Labour and Liberal, these staff were almost exclusively used by organisations who did not have paid agents.2.2.6 These shared officials are &quot;organisers&quot; in about half of the instances;almost all the remainder are secretaries, typists or clerks.2.3  Part-time staff2.3.1 Just under one-quarter of constituency organisations (23%) employpart-lime staff (excluding collectors). The majority of these are secretaries,typists or clerks.2.3.2 Only 5% of constituency organisations (11 of 238) employ subscriptionor donation collectors.2.4  Office2.4.1 The majority of constituency organisations have the use of an office(62%). About a quarter own an office, a similar proportion rent one, while 10%share an office with a city, borough or regional organisation. The remainderoperate from private houses.2.4.2 Virtually all Conservatives have the use of an office, while three-fifths of Labour and a quarter of Liberal organisations have the use of an office.2.4.3 Almost all organisations with full-time paid agents/secretaries have theuse of an office while two-thirds of them own their own office.2.5   Branches and ward parties2.5.1 Virtually all Labour and Conservative organisations have branches forward parties, while 14% of Liberal constituency parties do not. Aroundtwo-tlurds of Labour and Conservative organisations have more than fivebranches/ward parties, whereas only about two-fifths of Liberal organisationsdo.16717-77
2.5.2 About one-third of Conservative organisations have twenty or morebranches/ward parties compared with only 2% of Labour.2-5.3 There is evidence that the number of branches/ward parties is positivelyrelated to the presence of a paid agent in the organisation. The link is strongestwith regard to the Conservative constituency organisations, which as noted,accounted for the vast majority of agents found.2.5.4 It should be noted that there were some unanswered questions ranging from 10% for Liberal, 13% Labour, 15% Conservative which will affect the accuracy of these results.2.6 Local government election candidates2.6.1  Constituency organisations were asked for information with regard to:District Council and County Council Elections, 1973-England and WalesLondon Borough Elections, 1974District Council and Regional Council Elections, 1974 Scotland.1975 elections for English metropolitan districts were to be excluded.2-6.2 From Table B below it will be seen that there are slight differences inthe level of coverage, both by party and within party by presence of an agent.2.6.3CANDIDATES AT LAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS     TABLE B	Labour			Conservative			Liberal	All	Agtnt*	No	AU	Agent&apos;	No	AllCandidates:							One or more	95%	100%	93%	94%	94%	92%	83%Lest than half seats	11%	_	15%	16%	U%	32%	52%covered							Half or more seats covered All scats covered	26%	18%	28%	34%	39%	19%	18%	57%	82%	50%	44%	43%	41%	12%None							6%Not answered	5%	-	7%	6%	5%	8%	11%Full-time or part-time2.6.4 The level of coverage is generally lower for Liberal than for the other parties, while Labour &quot;total coverage&quot; of seats is higher than that ofConservatives. The presence of an agent in a Labour organisation is stronglyrelated to total coverage, whereas there is no such link in Conservative organ-isations. (The analysis for Labour organisations with agents is on a base of only 22.)2.6.5 &quot;Total coverage&quot; is much more likely in Borough constituencies (65%)than in County constituencies (13%).
3.  Finance3.1 In order to make realistic comparisons it has been necessary to restrictanalysis to those constituency organisations providing usable data for bothcalendar years for which information was requested-1973 and 1974.3.2  Outturn for 1973 and 1974 (and 1975 Estimates)3.2.1 The analysis of this information is based on a sub-sample of 184 of the organisations who were able to provide calendar year irrfonnation for bothyears. Of the 54 organisations not included, three-fifths (32) were Liberalorganisations. Over four-fifths of both Labour and Conservative organisations,were able to provide the required information. (Non-calendar year information for 1973 and 1974 was excluded because of the distortion. 1975 information was also based on all who gave calender year information and information for1973 and 1974).3.2.2  The overall picture is as follows, indexed on 1973 income^OO.

Labour and Conservative constituency organisationsroughly broke even in both 1973 and 1974 whereas Liberal organisations after being slightly in credit in 1973 moved into deficit in 1974.3.2.4 It will be seen that the rate of growth in both income and expenditure was greater for Labour than Conservative, and significantly greater still forLiberal.3.2.5 The 1975 estimates show that the level of income, though higher thanthat in 1973, has decreased since the election year. The overall picture in 1975indicates that the constituency parties expect to approach the break-even point and the Liberal constituency organisations expect to be in credit overall.
3.2.6 The disproportionate growth mentioned in 3.2.4 offsets only to a smallextent the difference in the average income and expenditure between organ-isations of the three parties.

Whereas in 1973 just over half of organisations were in surplus and just under half were in deficit, by 1974just over half were in deficit. The position remained the same for Conservativeorganisations, improved for Labour organisations and deteriorated markedlyfor Liberal organisations. In 1975 Labour organisations expected to remainin the situation where about half of them are in deficit, whereas almost two-thirds of Conservative organisations expected to be in deficit, and Liberalorganisations expecting to be in deficit had reduced to just over a quarter.

3.2.9 The presence of a full-time paid agent in the Conservative party decreasedthe likelihood of an organisation being in deficit in 1974 but had no effect in1973 or 1975, whereas the presence of a full-time paid agent in the Labourparty, increased the likelihood of the organisation being in deficit in both 1974and 1975 though it had no effect in 1973.3.2.10 Winning parties are no more likely to be in surplus than parties ingeneral, and there are no clear links between surplus/deficit and majority size.TOTAL SAMPLE table C(a) (3.3.2)	Ran			fes			1973			1974			Income	Expenditure		Income	Expenditure	No. for analysis	184	184		184	184	Amount  						Under 250	11%	12%&apos;		1%	2%&apos;	250-499	11%	13%		3%	2%				43%			9%500-749	11%	12%		5%	3%	750-999	7%	6%		2%		1,000-1,249	6%	4%		5%	4%	1,250-1,499	3%	3%		5%	4%	1,500-1,749	2%	3%		3%	4%	1,750-1,999	2%	3%		4%	3%	2,000-2,499	8%	5%^		10%	10 %\	2,500-2,999	5%	7%		6%	7%	3,000-3,499	3%	2%	.22%	7%	7%	-42%3,500-3,999	1%	3%		6%	4%	4,000-4,999	6%	5%		*%	14%&apos;	5,000-5,999	5%	5%		6%	5%	6,000-6,999	6%	1%		5%	5%	7,000-7,999	4%	4%		3%	2%	8,000-9,999	7%	3%		9%	9%	10,000-11,999	1%	2%		6%	9%	12,000-14,999	*	-		4%	3%	15,000 or more	 	 		2%	1%	* = less than 0-5%.
3.2.11 Parties in larger constituencies (number of electors) are somewhat less likely to have suffered a deficit in 1974 than those in smaller constituencies.Whereas 64% of those with less than 60,000 electors were in deficit in 1974,only 47% of those with more than 60,000 electors were in this position.3.3   Ranges of income and expenditure3.3.1 Tables C (a-d) (3.3.2) show the ranges of income and expenditure forthe total sample and the three parties for both years.TABLE C(b) (3.3.2)LABOUR	Ranges						1973			1974			Income	Expenditure		Income	Expenditure	No. for analysis	75	75		75	75	Amount  						Under 250	9%	8%&apos;		1%	1%	250-499	14%	12%		2%	2%	5%			52%			500-749	16%	22%		2%	1%	750-999	13%	10%,		2%	1%,	1,000-1,249	9%	6%		2%	3%	1,250-1,499	3%	4%		3%	5%	1,500-1,749	-	4%		4%	4%	1,750-1,999	3%	1%		6%	3%	2,000-2,499	7%	4%^		18%	16%^	2,500-2,999	6%	10%		8%	11%	3,000-3/199	4%	4%	i-24%	13%	13%	-51%3,500-3,999	-	1%		7%	5%	4,000-4,999	7%	5%J		u%	6%	5,000-5,999	1%	1%		6%	6%	6,000-6,999	3%	1%		3%	3%	7,000-7,999	1%	1%		1%	3%	8,000-9,999	1%	-		7%	6%	10,000-11,999	-	1%		1%	-	12,000-14,999	-	-		-	1%	15,000 or more	-	-		-	-

In the election year of 1974 about one-tenth fell in this category. There was relatively little growth in the size of thegroup of top earning/spending organisations whereas 23% had an income inexcess of  5,000 in 1973 the figure had only grown to 34% by 1974. Theincome/expenditure groups showing the greatest growth&apos;were the  2,000- 5,000range which accounted for slightly over one-fifth of organisations in 1973,slightly over two-fifths in 1974, and the  8,000-1- group-less than one-tenth of organisations in 1973 and over one-fifth in 1974.A.
3.3.4 Paragraph 3.2.6 above pointed to the difference in average income andexpenditure between parties and this difference is reflected in the distributions.Examination of income ranges for 1974 shows that:almost a third of Liberal organisations (12 of 37 analysed) earned less than 1,000, compared with only 7% of Labour, and only 3% of Conservative.almost one-quarter of Liberal constituency parties earned between  2,000and  5,000 and a further 9 % (3 organisations) over  5,000. The comparablefigures for these ranges are-Labour 57% and 18%Conservative            23% and 63%3.3.5 In 1974 no constituency party with a full-time paid agent earned lessthan  1,000, and only 1 (of a total of 55 with a full-time agent analysed) earnedless than  2,000. Forty-seven (85%) of these 55 organisations had 1974 income in excess of  5,000.3.3.6 Tabulation of the ranges of deficit shows that while in 1973 only two(1%) party organisations had a deficit of greater than  1,000, in 1974 theproportion was slightly over a tenth. A single Labour and a single Conservativeorganisation had a deficit exceeding  3,000 in 1974.3.3.7  Around 16% had a surplus of over  500 in both 1973 and 1974.3.4   1973 and 1974 Income and expenditure from wards/districts/branches3.4.1 Income, expenditure or working funds from wards etc, not included in previous sections applied to two-thirds of the organisations replying. Theaverage amounts, based on those organisations giving a figure at all, for eachcategory, are as follows:	Income and Expendi		itre from Wards etc		19	73	19	74	Number living figure	Average amount	Number giving figure	Average amountTotal income Total expenditure Working funds	23 22 66	 380  539  393	24 23 67	 604  565  427(Those who were unable to provide income and expenditure were asked for information onworking funds.

The proportion with any fixed assets is, in particular, much lower.
3.5.6 Labour average total assets remained the same between 1973-74 whereasthere was an average growth in assets in the same peroid of the order of 11 %for Conservative organisations. Liberal average loans and overdrafts increaseddramatically while Conservative^ increased by 11 % and Labours by 44%.3.5.7 In 1974 the average total assets in organisations with full-time paid agentswas  13,481 (Conservative) and  8,011 (Labour). The difference between thesetwo figures (and bearing in mind the large number of Conservative organisationswith a full-time agent) accounts for most of the &quot;difference&quot; between Labour andConservative organisations who have one in 1973 is around  4,650 and amongthe 22% in 1974, is almost  4,850. In 1973 17% of Labour organisations hada loan, with an average value of about  500. In 1974 slightly more (21 %) badone, and the average value was almost  600.3.5.8 When size of loans are reanalysed on just the organisations claiming tohave a loan at all, it is found that the average size of loan among the one-fifthConservative organisations who have one in 1973 is around  4,650 and amongthe22% in 1974, is almost  4,850. In 1973 17% of Labour organisations had a loan,with an average value of about  500. In 1974 slightly more (21 %) had one, andthe average value was almost  600.3.6  Breakdown of income and expenditure3.6.1 The following tables show the average income and expenditure by sourcefor the constituency organisations. The percentages in brackets represent theproportion of organisations within each party having income or expenditure ofeach type.3.6.2  See table overleaf3.6.3 The rank order of importance of sources of income in 1973 for theLabour Party as a whole were: 1st-Lotteries etc (39%)*, 2nd Subscriptions(12%), 3rd-Miscellaneous (10%), 4th-Social Functions (8%) and 5th TU/Coop Party Grants (7%). (Necessarily &quot;averages&quot; conceal some information,and some minor sources of income overall will be important to the small numberof organisations receiving them-eg regional or headquarter grants).3.6.4 For the Conservative Party as a whole the rank order was: 1st-Ward/branch grants (33 %), 2nd-Social Functions (19 %), 3rd-Subscriptions (16%),4th-Lotteries etc (9%), 5th-Miscellaneous (8%).3.6.5 For the Liberal Party as a whole the rank order was 1st-SocialFunctions(28%), 2nd-Ward/branch grants (27%), 3rd-Individual Donations (14%),4th-Grants from Headquarters (11%), Sthr^ur*prescriptions (8 %). For thosewho have a grant from Headquarters this was by far the most important source of income.       _,      _

3.6.11 For the Liberal Party as a whole the order was: 1st IndividualDonations (25%), 2nd-Miscellaneous (22%), 3rd-Wards/Branches Grants(20%), 4th-Social Functions (14%), 5th-Lotteries (8%). (The most noticeablechange from 1973 is the increase in importance of Individual Donations).3.6.12 The presence of a full-time agent in the Labour Party was associatedwith a threefold increase in the average income from Lotteries, and TU/CoopParty Grants, a doubling in that from Subscriptions and Miscellaneous sources,and a 50% increase in that from TU Donations. The rank order of importance for organisations with a full-time paid agent was therefore: 1st Lotteries (33%),2nd-Miscellaneous (16%), 3rd-TU/Coop Party Grants (12%), 4th-TUDonations (9%), 5th-Subscriptions (8%).3.6.13 The presence of a full-time paid agent in the Conservative Party wasassociated with 50% increase in income from each of the five major sources.3.6.14 Between 1973 and 1974 the overall level of subscriptions changes littlefor any party, but becomes relatively less important in each case.3.6.15 The main changes from 1973 to 1974 are: (Figures in brackets denotethe increase in percentage of constituency organisations within each party havingincome from the particular source).Laboura more than eight-fold increase in grants from Headquarters (-f-42%).a five-fold increase of TU Donations (4-17 %).a quadrupling of Individual Donations t+7 %).a quadrupling of Miscellaneous income (see below) (-1-22%).a doubling of TU/Coop Party Grants (4-2 %).a doubling of Wards/Branches Grants (-1-14%).Conservativea six-fold increase of miscellaneous income (4-23%).a trebling of donations from individuals (-1-9%).an almost doubling of Grants from Headquarters (4-8%).Liberala more than eleven-fold increase in miscellaneous income (-1-18%).a quadrupling of donations from individuals.an increase of two and a half times of income from lotteries (4-17%).an increase of one and a half times of Ward/sBranches grants (-f 12%).3.6.16 The Liberal Party was the only one to significantly increase income from lotteries.

However, while General Election expenditureaccounted for about half of all Labour and Liberal expenditure, it only accountedfor one-third of all Conservative expenditure. Liberals spent just over half that spent by the other parties on the 1973 Local Elections and almost two-thirds of the Conservative expenditure on the 1974 General Elections.3.6.28 It is understood that branches and wards bear most of the cost ofLocal Elections so that there is further expenditure not reported in this survey.

In 1973 organisations with Trade Union backing received a greater averageincome from TU donations (one and a half times as much), wards/branchesgrants, and miscellaneous sources than those without Trade Union backingHowever, those with Trade Union backing received less average income from individual Donations (a quarter of that received by those without backing).Grants from Headquarters (only  1 on average compared to  55), and socialfunctions (a third).In 1974 organisations with Trade Union backing again received a greateraverage income from TU donations (one and a half times as much) and mis-ceUaneous sources. (Grants from wards/branches was the same for both groupsthis year.) As in 1973, those with Trade Union backing received less averageincome from Individual Donations (a quarter of that received by organisationswithout backing). Grants from Headquarters (a tenth  45 compared to  439)and social functions (a half). In 1974 income from Regional Grants remained the same for organisations with Trade Union backing but increased for thosewithout.Expenditure on each item in 1973 was cither greater or approximately equalby organisations with Trade Union backing. (The only exception was Travelexpenses.) Expenditure on Salaries, Rent/Rates and Office Administration wasabout one and a half times greater.In 1974 organisations with Trade Union backing spent three times as much on local Government Elections and roughly one and a half times as much onSalaries and Rent/Rates as those without. Expenditure on all other items was again greater or approximately equal by organisations with Trade Unionbacking.In both years the average overall income for organisations with Trade Unionbacking was greater than for those without. In 1973 organisations without TradeUnion backing earned  1,653 on average and those with backing earned 494 more. Trade Union or Co-operative Party Grants accounted for almost all of this difference- 478. In 1974 those without Trade Union backing earned 3,354 and those with backing earned  697 more, however, the average TradeUnion or Co-operative Party Grant received by Labour organisations thatyear was  953.The overall average expenditure for organisations without Trade Union backingwas  1,634 in 1973 and  3,381 in 1974 and for organisations with Trade Unionbacking it was  2,063 in 1973 and  4,291 in 1974.
3.7   Income from and expenditure to headquarters3.7.1 Table H shows the average grants from headquarters and the averageaffiliation fees payable to headquarters. The importance of these as sources of income and expenditure can be seen in section 3.6.TABLE HTHE ROLE OF HEADQUARTERS OS INCOME AND EXPENDITURE OFCONSTITUENCY ORGANISATIONS: GRANTS AND AFFILIATION FEES	Labour	Conservative	LiberalBase:	75	73	37grants from headquarters			1973-number receiving	10%	11%	4% average amount they received	 439	 739	 1,9561974 number receiving	52%	19%	26%-average amount they received	 642	 781	 521affiliation fees to headquarters			1973-number paying	96%	74%	76% average amount they paid	 126	 318	 761974-number paying	98%	71%	81%-average amount they paid	 171	 414	 94overall balance			Average amount (based on all organisations): received in grants              1973 1974	 41  334	 81  150	 57  141paid in fees                     1973 1974	 120  166	 235  289	 57  77Balance                         1973 1974	-  79 4- 168	- 154 - 139	4-  64
3.7.2 Considering the parties separately-(figures for organisations with paidagents are not shown in the tables to avoid over-complicating the presentation).Labour 5 times as many organisations received grants in 1974 as in 1973 and on average they each received one and a half times as much.-Twice as many organisations with full-time paid agents received grants in 1974, though the amount they received in the two years remained almoststatic. Nearly all organisations paid afiiliation fees or quotas in both 1973 and1974. (All organisations with a paid agent paid fees or quotas each year.)The amount payable on average from each organisation increased by a third over the two years. The balance shows that the net increase in income exceeded the net increasein outflow to headquarters producing an overall surplus to the constituencyorganisations and a deficit to headquarters in 1974.Conservative-There was little change in either the number of organisations receivingincome (less than double in 1974) or the amount received on average by each organisation (increased by less than 6%). Roughly three-quarters of the organisations had expenditure in the formof affiliation fees or quotas in both years. The amount they each paidincreased on average by about three-tenths in 1974. Overall the constituency organisations were in deficit and headquarterswas in credit by approximately the same amount in both years. The presence of full-time paid agents increased by about a half both the grants received from headquarters and the outflow to headquarters in bothyears.liberal In 1973 only 2 organisations received income from headquarters and theaverage amount they received was in excess of  1,000. In 1974 five times as many organisations received income from headquarters but the averageamount received decreased by almost three-quarters.3.7.3 Overall, those organisations which received income from headquarters&apos;grants had a positive balance between headquarters income and outflow toheadquarters but as a whole the Labour Party had moved from a small negativebalance to a positive balance, the Conservative Party had maintained a negativebalance of about  150 per organisation and the Liberal Party broke-even in1973 and had a small positive balance in 1974.
1.7.4 Over three-quarters of organisations which received income fromheadquarters used the grants to cover election expenses or as unspecifiedgrants. As mentioned in section 2.1.6 only 11 % of agents are paid directly or indirectly from party headquarters and a further quarter by a combination ofconstituency and headquarters funds.3.7.5 There is no relationship between overall party surplus/deficit(section 3.2.6) and the balance of income/expenditure to and from partyheadquarters.3.7.6 The table below shows the relationship between the average grants fromheadquarters and the size of the majority between winning and second partyin the constituency.GRANTS FROM HEADQUARTERS ANALYSED BY MAJORITYMAJORITY	Less than 3,000	3,000-6,999	7,000-U$99	More than 12,000Base:	50	43	57	35Grants from HQ				1973 number receiving	13%	12%	2%	13% average amount they received	 1,482	 495	 222	 3261974 number receiving	39%	34%	31%	30% average amount they received	 883	 562	 444	 7683.8 The effect of support from headquarters and grants from trade unions force  -operative party on the membership of the organisations3.8.1 In both 1973 and 1974 all organisations with Trade Union backing hada membership of under 1,000 compared to those without Trade Union backing(just over three-fifths), In 1973 no organisation with Trade Union backing hada membership under 100 and in 1974 only a single organisation did.Membership levels were very similar in 1973 and 1974 for both organisationswith and without support from headquarters.
3.8.2 The table below shows the recency of last membership drive by presenceof Trade Union backing and support from headquarters in 1974.LAST MEMBERSHIP DRIVE	TU Backing	NoTU Backing	HQ Support	No HQ SupportBase:	26	212	75	163Currently	24%	15%	11%	18%All the Time	9%	12%	15%	10%September-November 1975	23%	21%	27%	18%January-August 1975	12%	26%	25%	25%1974	13%	16%	15%	15%(973	11%	8%	5%	10%1972 and Before	10%	8%	8%	8%Never	-	1%	1%	-There is no marked difference between those parties with and without support.3.8.3 The presence of Trade Union backing or support from headquartersdoes not make any significant difference to either the method of, or satisfactionwith, membership drive.3.8.4 In conclusion there does not appear to be a strong relationship betweenTrade Union or Headquarters support and level of activity within the constituency organisations.3.9   Examination of specific influences on financial state3.9.1 Several other factors were considered to see if they had any effect onincome and expenditure. It was found that:3.9.2 total income: Constituency organisations in the Midlands had thegreatest average total income in 1973- 3,370 followed closely by those in theSouth  3,338. In 1974 organisations in the South had an average total income of  5,607 and in Ihe Midlands- 5,407. In both years average total income inthe North- 2,164 in 1973 and  3,947 in 1974-exceeded that in Scotland- 1,684 and  3,115-which exceeded that in Wales- 1,095 and  2,724.Average total income for County organisations was  2,921 in 1973 (10% higherthan in Borough organisations) and  5,157 in 1974 (16% higher than in Boroughorganisations).
In both years organisations in the constituencies with the lowest majority hadthe highest average total income and those in constituencies with the highestmajority had the lowest average total income.3.9.3   income by source:Subscriptions-Ths average level was approximately between two and three times higher in the South of England than anywhere else. There was very little difference between Borough constituencies and County ones. Constituencieswith the largest majority (more than 12,000) had an average income of about three-quarters of that for constituencies with smaller majorities.Company Donations. The Midlands was the region with the greatest proportionof organisations receiving Company donations and the average amount receivedthere increased from about  80 in 1973 to almost  250 in 1974. However,Company donations in the North were on average  190 in 1973 and increasedby about a half in 1974. Borough constituencies received three and a half times as much as County constituencies in 1973 and one and a half times as much in1974.Trade Union Donations.-The level of these was highest in the South and theMidlands (about three times that in the other regions in 1973 and one and a halftimes in 1974). Only 13 % of organisations in Scotland and no organisations in wales received TU donations in 1973 whereas nearly a third of organisations inthese two regions received income from this source in 1974.Donations from Individuals. In 1973 the level of these donations was lowestin Scotland ( 57 compared with about  100 in the other regions). In 1974 theyincreased by about five times in Scotland and the South compared with between one and a half and three and a half times in the other regions. Although the overall level of individual donations increased by less than four times in 1974,donations to organisations in constituencies with a majority of less than 3,000increased more than five and a half times to  557. In both years the level ofdonations from individuals was lowest for constituency organisations with amajority of more than 12,000.Regional Organisations. Income from this source is at a lowest level in Scotland,9% of the Scottish organisations receiving  11 on average in 1974 comparedwith 23% of organisations in the South ( 46 on average) and about 30% else-where, each receiving more than  60.Trade Union/Co-operative Party Grants.-Organisations in the Midlands receivedabout a quarter of the average income received from these grants in 1973 byorganisations in the South and Scotland and less than a half in 1974. Boroughorganisations received three times as much as County ones in both years.Wards/Branches.-ln the South and Midlands a slightly greater proportion of organisations receive grants from their Wards or Branches and the amountreceived in these two areas is almost twice as much as in each of the other regions. County organisations receive more than twice as much as Borough
ones. Organisations in constituencies with a majority of less than 3,000 havethe highest average income and those with a majority of more than 12,000have the lowest average income from this source.Social Functions. Organisations in the South receive more income from socialfunctions than anywhere else and organisations in Wales receive least income from social functions. County constituency organisations receive about a fifthmore than Borough ones. Organisations in constituencies with a majority of less than 7,000 receive almost twice as much from social functions as those inconstituencies with a majority over 7,000.Lotteries etc-Average income from Lotteries is distributed in the following ways: Midlands ( 750), South ( 650), North ( 200), Scotland ( 150), Wales( 85) and about one and a half times as many organisations receive income from Lotteries in the South as in Wales. County constituency organisationsreceive about a fifth more than Borough ones. The average amount receivedby organisations in constituencies with a majority of over 12,000 is less than half that received in each of the more marginal constituencies.3.9.4 In 1973 the level of average total expenditure was greatest in theMidlands- 3,301 followed closely by the South- 3,193 and in 1974 the position was reversed-South  5,580, Midlands  5,483. The next highest average totalexpenditure in both years was the North followed by Scotland, then finallyWales ( 1,089 in 1973 and  2,917 in 1974).Expenditure for County organisations was 11% higher than in Boroughorganisations in 1973, and 21% higher in 1974.3.9.5 Expenditure by Source:Salaries/ Wages. Constituency organisations in the South and Midlands spentmost on salaries and wages. The difference was most marked in 1974 when these organisations spent  1,500 on average which was  600 more than organisationsin the North-the area with the next greatest expenditure. County organisations( 1,400) spent  350 more on average than Borough organisations. Averageexpenditure on salaries/wages was inversely related to the size of constituencymajority.Rent I Rates. The average amount spent in the South was more than doublethat spent anywhere else. Borough organisations spent a third more thanCounty ones.Office Adminlstration.-Tbjt average amounts spent in the South and Midlandsexceeded those spent in any of the other regions by at least 75%. Countyorganisations spent about one and a half times as much as Borough organisa-tions. The smaller the majority in the constituency the greater the amountspent.Travel Expen3es.-Were twice as high for County organisations as for Boroughones. The smaller the majority the greater the travel expenses.&apos;
Local Government Electlon-ln 1973 organisations in the South, Midlands and north each spent about  350 on average whereas those in Scotland and Walesspent about  100. (Approximately 80% of organisations in the South, Midlands,North and Scotland itemised Local Government Election expenditure comparedwith 50% in Wales.) In 1974 organisations in Scotland spent  322 each on average and this expenditure was itemised by 83 % of Scottish organisations.The average amount spent in the South had reduced to  175 (the proportionwho itemised this had fallen from 77% to 55%). In each of the other regionsthe proportions and amounts also fell in 1974 Midlands to  30 (20%) andthe North to  40 (30%) and Wales to  2 (7%). In 1973 expenditure for Boroughorganisations was about 45% greater than that for County organisations andin 1974 it was over twice as high for Borough organisations. The proportionsitemising this expenditure were greater in the Borough organisations 71 %in 1973 and 51 % in 1974 compared to 60% in 1973 and 33% in 1974 in Countyorganisations.General Elections The table below shows the distributions of average GeneralElection expenditure in 1974 across the regions and the proportion of organisations within each region which itemised election expenditure.	South	Midlands	REGION North	Scotland	WalesBase:	79	32	49	_	8Average General					Election					Expenditure 1974	 1,994	 2,272	 1,781	 1,574	 1,699	(97%)	000%)	(95%)	(100%)	(93%)County organisations spent slightly more on average than Borough organi-sations  2,140 compared to  1,760. Organisations in constituencies with amajority of less than 3,000 had the greatest expenditure of  2^32. Organisationsin constituencies with a 3,000-6,999 majority spent  1,976, with a 7,000-11,999majority- 1,857 and with the highest majority-over 12,000-the leastexpenditure, of  1,584.3.9.6 All the preceding figures teteting to incomer and expenditure must betreated with caution because it is clear from reports during the fieldworkperiod, and scrutiny of the questionnaires that book-keeping procedures are far from uniform. This comment applies not only to election expenditure butto other expenditure items, and also to income items.4.  Effect of Financial situation.1 In a brief final section to the questionnaire, party organisations were asked three direct questions on the effect of their present financial situation.The replies to these questions are the personal opinions of those who filled inthe questionnaire and not those of party organisations as such.
4,2 Over four-fifths of the sample are experiencing &quot;serious&quot; or &quot;moderate&quot;financial difficulty, a further one in ten have &quot;minor&quot; difficulty only 7% claimno financial difficulty.4.3 Conservative organisations are apparently a little less likely to be ex-periencing financial difficulty than those of the other parties. In particularonly one-quarter are experiencing &quot;serious&quot; difficulty compared with aroundtwo-fifths of Labour and Liberal.4.4 There is no clear indication that having a paid agent makes an organisationeither more or less likely to be in financial difficulty.4.5 Organisations which claimed any financial difficulty (&quot;serious&quot;, &quot;moder-ate&quot; or &quot;minor&quot;) were asked which items they were having to limit or cutback. The answers, in rank order of importance were as follows:	Communications/Leaflets	79%Local election expenses	58%Delegates to conferences	51%General election expenses	41%Numbers of staff	40%Premises	38%Salaries of existing staff	23%4.6 The Conservative organisations were somewhat less likely to cut backon either general or local election expenses, than Labour or Liberal andsomewhat more likely to cut back on salaries of staff. (It must be borne in mind that staff levels in Conservative organisations are higher, thus this is a biggerarea of potential saving for them.)4.7 Finally parties were asked how much additional income they thoughtwould be necessary to &quot;discharge (their) functions in an efficient yet economicalmanner&quot;. The range was from none to in excess of  10,000.4.8 The distribution of requirements is summarised below:TABLE IAdditional Income	Labour	Conservative	LiberalNone	4%	1%	-Up to 1,000	43%	23%	41%1,000-2400	12%	17%	15%2,000-3,000	14%	24%	10%3^00-5400	11%	21%	26%3400-10400	7%	1%	3%Over 10400	-	3%	2%Not answered	6%	s%	5%
4.9 Thus Labour organisations apparently have the lowest level of require-ment half believe that less than  1,000 additional income is required. Slightlyfewer Liberal organisations would be satisfied with this, while only a quarterof Conservative organisations would be.

ANNEX FPASTY ORGANISATIONS IN MARGINAL CONSTITUENCIESPiper prepared by the Central Statistical OfficeKrtrodadfoa1. This note presents the results of an investigation into the relationship between the finances, memberships and presence of agents in constituencyparty organisations and the winning or losing margin achieved by the organ-isations at the October 1974 General Election. The results of the October 1974election, which were not substantially different from those of February 1974in terms of rnargraality, were taken as the closest available measure of the stateof political activity in the constituencies in 1973 and 1974, the years for which information was gathered.The possibility that margmality could be an important factor, influencingconstituency party activity and finance was allowed for at the design stage ofthe survey by using, as one of the stratification factors in choosing the sampleof 100 constituencies, the elected party and the size of its winning margin at the october 1974 General Election. (The other three stratification factors weregeographical location, county/borough and electorate size.)There are many possible ways in which to define margmality. The analysishere is based on the following two-part definition of winning and losing margins:CO winning rnargut-rnajority over the second placed party; and00 losing margin number of votes polled by the losing party minusthe number of votes polled by the winning party in that constituency.Hence winning margins are denned by positive numbers of votes and losingmargins by negative numbers of votes. Ad alternative definition of marginwould be the above winning and losing margins expressed as a proportion ofthe electorate of the constituency. This variation was tried and produced nonoticeable differences from the results obtained using the above definition.Finance2. To preserve the confidentiality of replies from individual constituencyparties the information from this analysis is summarised in tables 1-3 below.Tables 1 and 2 show, for the Conservative and Labour organisations respectively,the middle 60% range of income and expenditure for the intervals of margin(i) losing margins greater than 4,000 votes, (ii) winning or losing margins lessthan 4,000 votes, and (iii) winning margins greater than 4,000 votes. For theLiberal parties, table 3, the range of margin is divided into only two intervals0) losing margin greater than 8,000 votes and (ii) losing margin less than 8,000votes or winning margin. It is felt that the tables give a fairly clear picture
of the levels and variability of income and expenditure in the different margingroups. The differences in patterns between the parties are shown by the tablesand may be suirimarised as follows: (i) For all parties there is, on average, lowest income and expenditurein seats with the largest losing margins.(ii) The general level of finance is highest for the Conservative associations.(iii) The Conservative associations have highest income and expenditurein their safe seats while for Labour parties the highest average income and expenditure is in their marginal seats. For the Conservativeassociations the main individual items contributing to the pattern of income are membership subscriptions, income from wards andbranches and surplus from social functions and special efforts, items which are clearly connected to the level of membership. The majorityof items of expenditure of the Labour parties tend to conform to the overall pattern of being highest in the marginal seats, with theexception of trade union donations and grants from trade unions andCo-operative parties, which are approximately the same in the marginaland safe seats.(iv) Because of the small number of marginal and safe Liberal seats littlecan be deduced from the table other than noting that income andexpenditure are higher in this category than in seats where the losingmargin was larger. The zero entries for 1973 in table 3 are due to thefact that a number of the liberal constituency parties only came into existence in 1974.Although, as we have shown, income and expenditure patterns are related tomargin, a similar analysis of surplus or deficit against margin shows no dis-cernible pattern winning parties are just as likely as losing parties to be in either surplus or deficit.MesnbersUp3. Tables 4, S and 6 give the middle 60% ranges of membership against marginfor the Conservative, Labour and Liberal parties respectively. The patternsfor membership are very similar to those for ^nam^ with the possible exceptionthat, for the Labour parties, the levels of membership are about the same intheir marginal and safe seats. All three parties have the lowest levels of member-ship in seats with their largest losing margins. The Conservative associationshave their highest memberships in their safest seats.Agents4. The numbers of organisations having no paid agent, a shared or part-timepaid agent, or a full-time paid agent are given in table 7. The Conservativeassociations have the highest number ofpaid agents-in fact none of the marginalor safe Conservative seats supplying information are without a paid agent.Almost 80% of Labour parties have no paid agent. There is a slightly higher proportion of paid agents in the Labour marginals than in the safe Labour seats.The Liberal parties have the lowest number of paid agents with more than 90 %without a paid agent.

INTRODUCTIONThis Annex contains a Report of a survey conducted by Research Surveys ofGreat Britain Ltd of the public&apos;s knowledge of and attitude towards political parties and, in particular, their opinions about state aid for the parties.
METHODOLOGYSamplingA representative sample of electors was drawn at random from electoral registerschosen from a nationally&apos; representative sample of 105 constituencies. Interviewswere conducted with the individuals selected from the electoral registers. Ataddresses where the named individual was not available for interview, as manyrecalls as possible were made to ensure a high response rate.Details of the analysis of the sample and response rate are shown in the appen-dices to this document together with a list of the sample points.FieldworkInterviewing was conducted between 5-19 December 1975 and 5-20 January1976 by fully trained members of RSGITs national field force, under the super-vision of 14 nationally based supervisors. All interviewers were personallybriefed on the study by a senior RSGB executive. Personal recalls were madeby supervisors on a proportion of all interviewers&apos; work as a check on the inter-viewing conducted.A copy of the questionnaire used is included in the appendices to this report.This questionnaire was developed from a two stage pilot survey which investt-gated understanding of the political system and established the &quot;language&quot;used by the general public.AnalysisThe analysis is based on 2,147 records. Before analysis, the sample was weightedto bring it in line with national population estimates. Summary tables areincluded in the body of the report. Other tabulations referred to in the text willbe found at the end of each section. A copy of the complete tabulations will besent to the Social Science Research Council Data Archive at Essex University.* Great Britain (does not include Northern Ireland).
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONSGeneral ObservationsIn interpreting the results of this study the methodology used and the limita-tions of such an approach should be borne in mind. Firstly, it must be recognisedthat for most people political parties and their financial situation is not a&quot;top^f-the-mind&quot; consideration. Therefore, in a detailed investigation suchas this it is inevitable that some education of respondents will take place. the study reported in this document was preceded by considerable pilot work to investigate the public&apos;s understanding of politics and thus to optimise the wayof asking the questions. For this main stage of the research a structured queation-naire that is, one using direct questioning together with a pre-printed list ofanswers was used. On most questions interviewers were given strict instruc-tions not to prompt respondents using the list of printed answers and there wasfacility for interviewers to write in answers which fell outside the list given.The actual scope of the final questionnaire was agreed with the Committee andit was decided not to include some of the areas investigated in the pilot work.The Importance of the Political Parties to the General public the overall results of the questions directly concerned with party finance haveto be viewed in the context of the public&apos;! overall appreciation of parties&apos;importance. Some preUrninary questions revealed that a large proportion of thepopulation did not consider &quot;political parties&quot; as being especially important for policy making, day-to-day running of the country, or looking after ordinarypeople, when compared whh other &quot;organisations&quot; and in particular with&quot;Government Ministers&quot; and the &quot;House of Commons&quot;. (Ref Tables A and C.)Answers to some other questions revealed some confusion as to the precisenature of parties, more particularly this affected women and older people whotended to be less interested in politics.Specifically with regard to the question of finance for political parties, it isworthy of note that only a very small proportion of the sample spontaneouslybelieved that some or all might be short of money. Nevertheless about half thesample thought that some parties, at least, might be short of money when asked a direct question. (Ref Sections 3.4 and 3.5.)b the General Principle of Finamdng Parties from PuMfc Puoda Acceptable?A straightforward question on the acceptability of &quot;money from public funds&quot;produced an almost equal division of opinion (45% in favour, 44% against,11% with no view). A further question investigated timing of provision ofpublic funds: only a minority of the public is in favour of providing moneybefore the economic situation improves. Cross-relation of the answers to thesequestions classifies people more clearly and in particular reveals a higher levelof uncertainty than the straightforward question suggested.- little more than one-tenth of the sample of electors are in favour of immediate state aid to political parties
  however, about two-fifths of the sample are clearly in favour of the principleof state aid  one-third of the sample is clearly opposed to state aid  the remaining quarter of the sample did not have definite or consistentviews.It will be seen that a majority of those with a clear view accept the idea of stateaid to political parties. (Ref Sections 5.3 and 5.5.)What are the Reasons for Accepting or Rejecting the Principles?As noted, there is little spontaneous awareness of the financial problems whichpolitical parties may be experiencing, although more direct questioning revealsboth that on balance some or all parties are thought to be short of money,while attitudinal questions indicate majority acceptance of the idea that partiesneed an adequate financial basis.Overall the grounds for rejection of the principle tend to reflect doubts onparties&apos; place in the list of national priorities and on the ways the money would be used.There is a link between acceptance of the principle and concern over the two major industrial sources of party funds companies and trade unions whichsubstantial sections of the sample felt might adversely affect parties&apos; policies.(Ref Sections 6.8 and 6.9.)It can be said that acceptance or rejection of the principle is not strongly linkedto interest in politics or the lack of it, Rather, it appears that those people with less certain views are likely to be less politically concerned. (Ref Section 6.6.)
COMMENTARY1. Political Parties in context1.1 As an introduction to the topic and to provide some measure of thestanding and salience of political parties, respondents were asked to say which one of a number of &quot;organisations&quot; was most important, and which leastimportant, in each of three roles.The organisations, presented to respondents on a show card were: LargeCompanies; Government Ministers; The Civil Service; The Political Parties;Your Local Council; Trade Unions; The House of Commons.1.2 As the summary Table A opposite shows the level of mentions is relatively low for political parties further analysis shows that over three-quarters ofthe sample (76 %) did not mention them as most important on any of the threeissues, and over four-fifths (81 %) did not mention them as least important.1.3 Of the three issues covered, political parties were most strongly identifiedwith &quot;policy decisions&quot;.

2.  Knowledge of Political Parties2.1 Although a number of questions were included to assess knowledge of parties and the party system in a general sense, it was made clear to respondentsthat their views were being sought and that there were no &quot;right&quot; answers.2.2  Perceptions of main parties in national and local government2.2.1 The pattern of mentionsmany or as few as they wished)Those mentioning.......as a main partyLabourConservativeLiberalSNPPlaid CymruCommunist PartyUlster UnionistsNational FrontSDLPRatepayers&apos; AssociationsDon&apos;t KnowOverall, women, older people and those completing their full time educationearly-(TEA)t tended to mention fewer parties. (Ref. tables 2a(i)-(iv).)2.2.2 Socio-economic group influences the pattern of mentions; thus it mustbe noted that the answers reflect attitudes as well as knowledge.While mentions of the Labour Party as a &quot;main&quot; party is relatively stableacross the four class groupings, the level of mentions for Conservatives andLiberals falls among the lower socio-economic groups (SEG) for both &quot;National&quot;and &quot;Local&quot; Government.

2.2.3 In Scotland 28% of respondents mentioned SNP as a &quot;main&quot; party in national government, 18% for local government. 16%ofthe sample in Walesmentioned Plaid Cymru for national government, 17 % for local government.There is no indication of &quot;mutual support&quot; between followers of the twonational parties.2.3   What do the parties do!2.3.1 Respondents were asked what the parties they had mentioned did-bothin national and local government-and the open-ended answers were sub-sequently grouped into appropriate categories. Some people gave more thanone answer.The range of answers points both to some confusion as to the nature of parties,&apos;and to some concern about their operations.national government%Those mentioning:Run/govern the countryDecide/carry out policies2911Decide legislation/pass billsNational finance/economyHousing/environment/services etcWorldwide issues662    V POSITIVELook after individualsDemocracy/freedom etcIncrease standard of living1121Mght each other/look after own interestL-ook after their own kindCater for specific groups62(Business, free enterprise, TU&apos;s etc)1    ) NEGATIVECause chaos/do a bad jobDo very little/nothing47Other specific answers3Vague answersIrrelevant answersDon&apos;t know/no answer5415

The importance of &quot;non-parliamentary&quot; party organisations is felt to be slight.592233323Labour	Conservativeii	&amp;32	2710	156	73	23	31	21	140	22	221	13	24	51	117	22Those mentioning:Prime Minister/Leader of OppositionMinisters/Opposition SpokesmenMPs/Back benchersLocal Party WorkersParty conferenceTraisport House/Central OfficeYoung SocialUto/ConservativelLeft/Ring Wingkroups&apos;Trade Unions/ttJCCompaniesCivil ServiceGeneral PublicOlher answersIrrelevant answersDon&apos;t know/No answer&apos; Induces Tribune Group, Monday Club
2.4.3 It can be seen that the pattern is very similar for the two parties-exceptthat Trade Unions are more widely thought to have influence on Labour thanCompanies are on the Conservatives.2.4.4 The level of mentions of Trade Unions increases significantly among those who left school at 17 or later, and among the ABC1 socio-economicgroups, and the likelihood of mentioning Large Companies also increasesamong these groups. In contrast, these groups are less likely than average tobelieve that the Prime Minister or Leader of the Opposition is important.Among ABs in particular the level of mentions for Trade Unions was over two and a half times that for the Prime Minister, while Large Companies receivedabout half as many mentions again as the Leader of the Opposition.(Ref. tables 2b(i)-(ii).)2.4.5 The respondent^ sex also affected the level of mentions of these answers.Nearly half of men mentioned trade unions (Labour) compared with under one-third of women; and about one-third of men mentioned Large Companies(Conservative) compared with 14% of women. Women were more likely to mention the Prime Minister/Leader of the Opposition. (Ref. tables 2c(iH&apos;0-)2.4.6 The general question about the Liberal, and Scottish or Welsh nationalparties revealed a great deal of uncertainty as to the people or organisationsimportant in deciding policies 43 % of the sample was unable to give an answer.

3. General attitudes to Political Parties3.1 Attitudinal questions were phrased in terms of the parties in general,respondents therefore being encouraged to put aside particular prejudices.3.2.   What should the parties do ?3.2.1 Having already asked peopled understanding of what parties did, the survey investigated what they thought parties should do. Because of the difficultyin obtaining clear unambiguous answers to open-ended questions, respondentswere asked to react to six possible activities.	% Answering			Yes	No	Don&apos;t knowShould the parties:			Help to decide what the government policies should be?	86	7	7Get people to vote in elections?	77	16	6Provide a government team ?	71	14	15Help to run local government ?	59	32	9Organise MPs in the House of Commons ?	55	31	15Choose parliamentary candidates?	55	35	10Explain policies to the public ?	95	2	3(Percentages sum to 10 horizontally subject to rounding.)3.2.2 In general, women, people aged 65 or over and those in the lowersocio-economic groups were more likely not to give a definite answer to thesequestions.3.2.3 It can perhaps be inferred that it is largely acceptable for parties to be involved in the overall running of the government but somewhat less so forthem to be involved in influencing the choice or action of representatives ofthe people. *3.2.4 The level of acceptability of &quot;getting the people to vote&quot; suggests littleconcern with the dangers of influencing the choice of the people themselves.3.3.   Agreement with Statements about Political Parties in general3.3.1 Eleven statements were read to respondents who were asked to answer in terms of one of the following:Agree Strongly (4)Agree a Little (3)Disagree a Little (2)Disagree Strongly (1)__*At the tune of neldwork the Newham/Prentice issue was in the public mind and may have affected the pattern of answers to these questions.
3.3.2 Table B overleaf shows the overall distribution of answers to each of thestatement?. The mean score shown is produced by assigning each answer abovewith the score shown in brackets, summing these scores and dividing by thetotal sample (less those respondents answering &quot;don*t know&quot; or not giving an answer). Therefore, the higher the score the greater the propensity of thesample to agree with the statement. (The range of scores is 4.00 1.00, with .50 as the mid-point.)

3.3.3 It will be seen that there are some contradictions in the answers given,suggesting an uncertainty about political parties and their roles.3.3.4  On the positive side, parties are seen as:-essential to our form of national government-86 % agree, 55 % strongly a good thing for Britain 84% agree, 46% strongly-keeping the Government on its toes-77 % agree, 38 % strongly the only way to represent the publics views 65% agree, 32% strongly-telling the public about important political issues 57% agree, but only18% strongly.3.3.5  But against this there was majority agreement that:-they oppose each other for the sake of it-68 % agree, 35 % strongly-they are not necessary in local politics-51 % agree, (though 38%disagree).And a majority (54%) disagree that the alternative to political parties is dic-tatorship (35% agree). (There may, however, have been some misinterpretationof this statement; some respondents may have answered in terms of preference,others in terms of practical alternative.)3.3.6 There was relatively little agreement with the idea that parties follow the policies of extremists (27% agree, 59% disagree).3.3.7 There was strong minority support for the statement that it was &quot;agood idea to have a lot of small parties as well as two or three big ones&quot;-41% agree, 51% disagree.3.3.8 Yet, another statement representing almost the opposite end of thespectrum-&quot;we would be better off with just one national party&quot; producedvery similar levels of agreement (38%) and disagreement (54%).3.3.9 There are a number of differences by demographic group (sex, age, s.e.g.,etc) on individual statements but no clear pattern emerges. For the purposes ofanalysing this data a number of alternative methods of sub-dividing the popula-tion have been used. One of these referred to as &quot;Political Interest&quot; is particularlyrelevant both to this question and a number of others. This is a compositegrouping made up of the answers to eight questions on political activity and interest. (A full denhitionis shown in Appendix A). Briefly, however, respondentswere scored from 0 (low interest) to 8 (high interest), and were then grouped,thus isolating the extremes:Political Interest Score % of Population in GroupIt will be noted that the distribution of &quot;interest&quot; is skewed to the positive endof the scale. Clearly a different distribution could have been produced byVery HighHigh(7 - 8)(5 - 6)(3 - 4)d-2)( 0  )52950134MediumLowNil
reorganising the groupings, nevertheless it is worthy of note that one-third ofthe population is sufficiently interested in politics to &quot;score&quot; 5 or more out of 8,while only half this number &quot;score&quot; as little as 2 or less.3.3.10 People with a higher than average political interest tend to be more favourably disposed towards political parties. In addition, unsurprisingly, theyare more likely than average to be able to express an opinion (ie a low level of&quot;don&apos;t knows&quot; is found).TABLE CGENERAL ATTITUDES TO PARTIESMean Score-^ Agree Strongly)(^Disagree Strongly) Political Interest Group	Total	Very High	High	Medium	Low	NilFavourable Attitudes to Parties (Higher scores are more favourable)						Political parties are essential to our form of national government	3-45	3-80	3-51	3-43	3-35	311In general the parties are a good thing for Britain	3- 34	3-62	3-41	3-34	319	2-88They keep the Government on its toes by criticising it	3 18	3-32	3-27	316	3-04	2-92They are the only way to represent the public&apos;s views	2-93	3-22	2-95	2-93	2-81	2-67Parties tell the public about important political issues	2-64	2-79	2-64	2-65	2-54	2-59It&apos;s a good idea to have a lot of small parties as well as two or three big ones	2-30	2-30	2-30	238	2-35	2-59The alternative to political parties is dictatorship	216	2-28	2-25	2-13	1-97	2-14Unfavourable Attitudes to Parties (Lower scores are more favourable)						They follow the policies of extremists	2-05	1-99	2-11	200	2-20	1-94We would be better off with just one national party	225	2-05	2-07	2-28	2-54	2-56They are not necessary in local politics	2-63	2-64	2-68	2-58	2-69	2-75They oppose each other for the sakeoftt	2-96	2-69	2-94	2-96	308	3 033.3.11 &quot;High&quot; interest people score parties more favourably on:  essential to our form of national government  only way to represent the public&apos;s views  a good thing for Britain

financial situation. The major areas of concern mentioned, however, were,firstly, the internal strife which parties were thought to be suffering from rivalor extremist groups (mentioned by 30% of respondents) and the &quot;squabbling&quot;between parties, apparently for the sake of it (17%). Problems of finance werementioned by 6%. (H-cf tables 3a (iHvi).)Half the sample was unable to think of any problems which parties had.3.4.2 People who claimed party membership (8 % of the sample) were notsurprisingly rather more likely to mention parties&apos; financial troubles, and thelevel of mentions rose to 15 % amongst those who contribute money other thannormal subscriptions. (However, the sample for analysis in this case is only 46.)3.4.3 Problems of finance were mentioned with the same frequency by both those in favour of parties receiving money from public funds and by thosewho were not.3.5  Do the parties have enough moneyl3.5.1 The more direct question-&quot;do you think the parties have enough moneyto run their national and local organisations or are some of them short ofmoney?&quot;-produced a majority view that some were short of money (51 %),with 32% disagreeing and 16% uncertain. (Ref tables 3b(i)-(vi) )3.5.2 People less likely to think that some parties were short of money, werewomen aged 45 or over, people with a terminal education age of 16 or younger,those in the C2DE groups, and those with less interest in politics. (The first three variables tend to be indicators of the fourth.)3.5.3 Regionally, Scotland is most likely to think that some parties are short of money (60 %), followed by South East England (58 %). Wales is the regionleast inclined to this view almost as many respondents in this region thoughtparties had enough money (41 %) as thought that some were short (46%).3.5.4 Over three-fifths of party members think that some parties are short ofmoney, while three-quarters of those making additional contributions think so(compared with exactly half of non-members).3.5.5 People who were in favour of Government funds for parties were more likely to think that some parties were short of money (58%) than those whowere against state aid (50 %).3.5.6 The Liberal Party was easily the party most often mentioned as beingshort of money, followed by Labour, SNP, Piaid Cymru and Conservative inthat order. One-quarter of those who had said that some parties were short of
money answered in terms of &quot;all&quot; to the subsidiary question, and if this figure is added to each party&apos;s specific mentions the following picture is seen:PARTIES SHORT OF MONEYBase: 51 % of sample saying some were &quot;short of money&quot;Those mentioning: %Liberal All) 75Labour ^ All) 55SNP All) 40Plaid Cymru C+ All) 36Conservative All) 343.5.7 Quite clearly there must be doubt as to each respondents definition of&quot;all&quot; and it would be unwise therefore to treat the combined level of mentionsfor each party too literally. Specific mentions of other parties were no greaterthan 5%.

4.  Party finance.1   What parties need money for .1.1 Respondents were asked which was the main thing for which partiesneeded money, and for which other things did they need it.4.1.2 The largest group of mentions related either to election canvassing orcampaigns (mentioned as &quot;main&quot; by 31%) or more generally to advertising,publicity and propaganda (16% &quot;main&quot;).4.1.3 These were followed by mentions of headquartersjnational administration(8% &quot;main&quot;) and payment of workers (7% &quot;main&quot;).4.1.4 The continued confusion in the minds of some respondents about the precise nature of parties is shown by the 9% who gave as the &quot;main&quot; thingparties needed money for, answers such as &quot;exports&quot; or &quot;running the country&quot;.In addition, about a quarter of the sample were unable to answer this question.4.1.5  The overall answers to this question are summarised below.

4.2.2 It will be seen from Table D that &quot;don&apos;t know&quot; answers account for a&quot;bouta quarter of the total for Labour and Conservative, just under one-half forLiberal, around three-fifths for the Communist Party and the Nationalists, and about seven-tenths for National Front.4.2.3 Industrial sources dominated the answers for the two major parties &quot;large companies&quot; account for exactly half of Conservative mentions (&quot;smallerfirms&quot; a further 6%), and &quot;trade unions&quot; accounted for 57% of Labourmentions.4.2.4 For Liberal, 10% mentioned &quot;large companies&quot; and 8% &quot;smallerfirms&quot;.4.2.5 For the Liberal Party and the minor parties individual donations andsubscriptions was the most often mentioned source; and this was also the secondmost often mentioned source for both Conservative and Labour. (However,the number of mentions for Labour-26%-is somewhat lower than the 36&quot;%mentions for Conservative and Liberal.)4.2.6 Small numbers of people believe that parties already get money from theGovernment-6% in the case of both Conservative and Labour.4.2.7 In Scotland, the level of definite answers for the national parties in-creased 46% mentioned subscriptions, and only 38% answered &quot;don*t know&quot;.There was no comparable decrease in &quot;don&apos;t know&quot; answers in Wales.(Ref table 4a.)4.2.8TABLE DSOURCES OF FINANCE FOR EACH PARTY	Conserva-tive	Labour	Liberal	Scottish A Welsh Nattonal-ists	CP	NFThose mentioning for:	V	V	V		&quot;/	VTrade Unions	/o 1	il	7o 1	/a 2	7	/o 1Large companies	50	7	10	2	*	1Smaller firms	6	3	8	2	*	1Subscriptions/ Individual donations	36	26	36	29	20	20The Government	6	6	4	2	1	foreign countries	1	1	*	*	18	2Social functions	10	7	7	4	2	2Elsewhere	10	9	6	5	6	5Don&apos;t know	26	23	47	61	55	71*-tess than 0-5%
4.3  Acceptability of sources4.3.1 For each source that they had mentioned (irrespective of which partiesthey mentioned it for), respondents were asked whether it was &quot;a good or a badthing&quot; that parties got money from it.4.3.2 A sunimary is shown in Table E (page 254); care in interpretation isrequired since there are three variables frequency of mention of a source,balance between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; and the reasons for saying it was a &quot;bad&quot;thing.4.3.3 Over half of the sample mentioned trade unions as a source, and a majorityof those who did, considered them as a &quot;bad&quot; source (51 % bad, 39% goody.The balance of opinion was somewhat less favourable among the higher socio-economic groups (ABCls).There was not a clear pattern of differences in terms of &quot;political interest&quot;.(Ref tables 4b(iH&quot;0)4.3.4 Again, just over one-half of the sample mentioned large companies as a source, but by contrast with trade unions a majority of those who did, regarded it as a &quot;good&quot; source (52% good, 37% bad). The balance of opinion was againrather less favourable among higher socio-economic groups (ABCls).Again, there was no significant variation in opinion between those with greaterand lesser interest in politics. (Ref tables 4c(i)-(&apos;ii)-)4.3.5 It will be noted that working class people are more favourable than theaverage to both these major income sources. A more polarised class differencemight have been expected.In 2.4.4 we noted that the middle classes were more likely to regard &quot;industrial&quot;organisations as important in deciding what parties do. It can now be seen thatthis tends to be accompanied by rejection of financial support from these organisations.4.3.6 It was noted in 4.2.6 that a minority of respondents believed that partiespresently obtain money from the Government. A total of 8% mentioned this source for one or more parties and the balance of opinion is strongly favourable(66% good, 23% bad). The small numbers for analysis make it difficult toexamine sub-groups, but yet again there is an indication that C2DEs are more favourably disposed to this source. (Ref Table 4d.)4.3.7 About half the 39 respondents who believed that money from theGovernment was a bad thing, took this view because it was their money whichwas being used (or more strongly put, wasted).

4.4 Attitudes to party finance.4.1 Respondents were asked to react to a number of statements concerningparties&apos; money using the same agree-disagree four point scale described earlier.Table F shows the overall distribution of answers to each statement togetherwith the mean score. (See 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 for explanation.)4.4.2 Once more, the overall range of answers to different statements is somewhat contradictory suggesting some uncertainty. Further evidence of thisis provided by the relatively high level of &quot;don&apos;t know&quot; answers-13% on average over the eight statements (compared with 8% over the eleven general attitude statements).4.4.3  The overall balance of opinion was favourable to parties only on:-they need money to tell the people what they&apos;re doing (70% agree,25% strongly)-political parties have far too much money (48% disagree, 33% agree)4.4.4 Opinion was quite evenly split on:-if they can&apos;t get enough money from their own supporters they are not worth supporting (47% agree, 43% disagree) I would be very worried if I knew the main political parties were short of money (45% agree, 46% disagree).

5.  Solutions to the Financial Problem5.1 In investigating this area, respondents were asked a number of questions about potential sources of income, which were phrased including the assumptionthat parties needed money.5.2  Possible sources5.2.1 People were asked to suggest one or more ways in which money couldbe provided to parties; answers were not prompted.5.2.2 Two-fifths of the sample were unable to suggest any sources. Four sourcesreceived fairly similar levels of mention:More money from supporters 16 %National Lottery 13%Taxation 12%Social Events 10%Money from the Government, Exchequer or Treasury was mentioned by8 % (Pilot work indicated that some people differentiated between this and money from &quot;taxation&quot;). There were small levels of mentions for voluntaryhelp (5 %) business (5 %) and trade unions (3 %).5.2.3 For each source they mentioned, people were asked whether they werein favour of money being provided in that way. In a number of cases the reactionwas almost totally favourable:-National Lottery 92% of those who mentioned, were in favour From Supporters 89% of those who mentioned, were in favour Social Events 97 % of those who mentioned, were in favour Voluntary Help 87 % of those who mentioned, were in favour.5.2.4 There was a somewhat lower proportion in favour of money coming from industrial sources: Trade Unions  61 % in favour, 35 % against Business        72% in favour, 20% against.5.2.5 We noted the distinction between &quot;taxation&quot; and &quot;Government/Exchequer/Treasury&quot; in 5.2.2. The two sources provoked differing reactions:	Money could be provided from:		Taxation	Government/Exchequer /Treasury% Mentioning as a source:	12	8%of those mentioning who are:		in favour	39	78against	SS	18don&apos;t know	5	4
5.3   Money from public funds5.3.1 A number of questions were asked, directly concerned with the provisionof state aid to political parties.These covered general acceptance or non-acceptance of the principle reasons for rejecting the principle limitations of the principle to certain parties whether principle should be executed immediately limitations on use division of money among national and local parties.5.3.2 The question &quot;still assuming that parties needed money, would you beprepared for some of it to be provided by the state from public funds?&quot;produced an almost equal division of the sample:Don&apos;t Know - 11%(The 1 % difference is, of course, not statistically significant.) (Ref. tables 5a(i)-(vi).)5.3.3 Differences between population sub-groups are not particularly marked.Men in the middle age groups---(35--54) and people with high &quot;political interest&quot;scores (5-8) are somewhat more in favour than the average.Men 35-54-52% in favour, 43% againstPolitical Interest (&quot;very high&quot; and &quot;high&quot;) 53 % in favour, 41 % against.5.3.4 The reasons for not being prepared for parties to have money from public funds were as follows, in order of importance:YesNo-45%-44%Those not in favour who mentioned. . . as a reasonTaxes/Rates too high already etcMoney wasted/needed for essentialsShould raise their own moneyCountry can&apos;t afford itWould be supporting parties don&apos;t agree withWould be put to misuseWould be controlled by party in governmentParties would fight over their sharesOther specific answersVague answersIrrelevant answersDon&apos;t know/no answer(Ref. tables 5b(iMiv).)Those not in favour321816773215535
5.3.5 Some of these reasons show variation by population sub-group, Inparticular the &quot;money wasted/needed for essentials&quot; was more frequentlymentioned by younger people; there is a steady decline in mentions from 29%of 18-24 year-old men, and 28% of women in this age group, to II % of 55-64year-old men, and 16% of women. However, the answers of older men andwomen diverge--23% of women aged 65 or more gave this reason comparedwith just 9% of men. People in the middle classes (ABCI) are more concernedby the fact that they would be &quot;supporting parties they did not agree, with&quot;.5.3.6 Those people in high &quot;political interest&quot; groups (5-8) who were againststate aid (see 5.3.3), were slightly more concerned than average that parties&quot;should raise their own money&quot; (21%).5.4 Should all parties receive aid!5.4.1 About one-fifth of the sample would deny money to some parties, if itwere provided from public funds. About two-thirds said that it should go to all parties if it were provided. (The remainder were unsure.)5.4.2 The most general restriction was to the Communist Party, mentioned by 47% of those who wished there to be a restriction (10% of the total sample).5.4.3 Labour, Conservative, Liberal, the National Front, SNP and PlaidCymru were each mentioned by around one-fifth of those who wished forrestrictions (4%-5% of the total sample in each case). (Ref. table 5c.)5.5  Should aid be immediate 75.5.1 To further test the acceptability or otherwise of providing parties withstate aid, a second question was asked. &quot;Which of the statements on this cardbest describes your attitude to parties getting money from public funds&quot;.The statements used, and the proportion choosing each, were:  Parties should get money from public funds 15%  Parties should get money from public funds but not until the economy improves 40%  Parties should not get money from public funds at all 38%  Don&apos;tknow 8%(The order of presentation of the statements was reversed for halfthe interviews.)(Ref. table 5d.)5.5.2 It will be seen that while only 15% are in favour of immediate action,55% would be in favour in a better economic situation. (If the don&apos;t knowsare excluded, the latter figure improves to 59% of those with a view-nearly three-fifths.)5.5.3 In terms of restrictions in the use of money from public funds, easilythe biggest single item was &quot;entertaining/expenses&quot; mentioned by almost one-third of the sample. This was followed by &quot;foreign visits&quot; (11%) and &quot;adver-advertising&quot; and siinilar descriptions (10%). One-third of respondents did notmention any restrictions.
5.5.4 A little over two-fifths of the sample thought parties should decide for themselves how to allocate state money between national and localconstituency organisations. One-quarter thought that the money should besplit evenly. 9% thought most should go to the national party, 8% most tothe local constituency, while the remaining 6% did not have a view. (Ref.table 5e.)5.6  Willingness to contribute to a political party5.6.1 Information was collected on party membership (party not specified),payment of any additional money, willingness to contribute more, and willing-ness to contribute at all, if not a party member.5.6.2  A scheme of behaviour and attitude in this respect can be produced.Party Bomber1V&quot; &quot;jj0/O.K.8* 92%I IContributes money other Prepar-ed^to contribute ifthan tonic lubscripUon the,peilieB ask ad for aoney* *^       33)!/ 59*Prepared to contribute Prepared tomart IT party asked contribute &apos;no re If par tierNo T^Y?.      aBk8d   .       /.Jt Negligible proportion of this group notprepared to contribute more5.6.3 It can be seen that of the 8% of the sample who are party members,about a quarter currently contribute more than the basic subscription, while a further half claim that they would be prepared to pay more if they were asked.Perhaps more surprisingly, over a third of the non-member sample claim thatthey would be prepared to contribute to one of the parties if asked. Surveyexperience is that questions of this type tend to produce considerable over-estimates-the answers should be regarded as measures of attitude rather thanbehaviour.

*, Detailed Consideration of the Acceptability of State Aid to Parties6.1 The basic findings have already been presented. In this section an attempt is made to evaluate more closely the acceptability of the state aid concept andto compare sections of the population with varying attitudes.6.2  Firstly, we can cross-relate the two questions&apos; which directly approached the topic of state aid, thus providing a finer &quot;scale&quot; of favourability.These groups can be described thus:(i) In favour of state aid no delay necessary (said &quot;yes&quot; Q.15a,and &quot;should get&quot; Q.17) 13%(ii) In favour of state aid but not until economy improves (said&quot;yes&quot; Q.15a, &quot;not until economy improves&quot; Q.I7) 28%(iii) Uncertain view (answers other than those defined in (i), (ii) or(iv) includes contradictory answers and &quot;don&apos;t know&quot;) 26%(iv) AgainststateaidCsaidW^^S^and^houldnotgerQ-lT)  33%6.3  A number of points need to be made using this &quot;scale&quot;:-a small proportion only are wholeheartedly in favour of immediate stateaid in more favourable economic times, about two-fifths clearly support theprinciple excluding the one-quarter proportion of the population who are uncertain,or who had apparently contradictory views in the two questions theproportion in favour of state aid is:immediate 17%immediate 4- when economy improves 55 % nevertheless there is a substantial group (one-third of the population) for whom state aid is not acceptable and this group in fact accounts for 45 %of all these who have a consistent view.6.4 We can now, by dividing the sample into the four groups shown in 6.2examine the differences between people with differing attitudes to state aid indetail. (Ref. tables 6a-f.)6.5  In terms of demographics the following patterns emerge:-men, particularly those aged between 35 and 54 are over-represented in thegroup in favour of &quot;immediate&quot; state aid. Over three-fifths (63 %) of this group are male-however, men are also slightly over-represented in the &quot;against&quot; state aidgroup (53 % against 48% in the population as a whole). Therefore, overallthere is a greater tendency for men to take a &quot;definite&quot; view (for or against)as compared to women-middle class (ABC1) men in particular are more likely to take a strongpositive view (&quot;immediate&quot; state aid). Again there is also a tendency formale ABCls to be over-represented in the &quot;against&quot; group(Ref. tables oaflH&quot;).)*Q.15a-see 5.3.2Q.17 -see 5.5.1
6.6  Examining these four groups by &quot;political interest&quot; we find the following:	View on Stale Aid				&quot;Immediate&quot;	&quot;Later&quot;	&quot;Against&quot;	&quot;Uncertain&quot;Those in &quot;politics! interest&quot; group:	%	%	%	%high 5-8	41	39	32	25medium 3-4	46	48	52	50low 0-2	12	13	17	24Thus in particular it can be seen that those &quot;against&quot; state aid tend to take lessinterest in politics than those in favour, but more than those with an uncertainview on state aid. (Ref. table 6b.)6.7 Whilst the overall level of party membership (8 %) makes it difficult tomake any comparisons between the four groups, there is a clear differencebetween them in terms of willingness to give (more) to parties personally whetheror not contributions are presently made:	View on State Aid				&quot;Immediate&quot;	&quot;Later&quot;	&quot;Against&quot;	&quot;Uncertain&quot;Those who are: Party member	% 10	% 9	% 9	% 6Prepared to give (more) to party whether or not presently contri-buting	53	45	34	30Therefore acceptability of state aid can be seen to correlate positively withclaimed willingness to contribute personally (but see 5.6.3). (Ref. Table 6c.)6.8 Those in favour of &quot;immediate&quot; state aid are less favourably disposed tothe financing of parties through &quot;industrial&quot; organisations trade unions and companies. Section 4.3.8 shows the overall picture but if we re-analyse all those
mentioning these sources to show the balance of opinion the following pictureemerges:	View on Stale Aid				&quot;Immediate&quot;	&quot;Later&quot;	&quot;Against&quot;	&quot;Uncertain&quot;Proportion of those mentioning...	%	%	%	%who said it was a good/bad thing				thai parties get money from this				source:				Trade Unions				Good	35	39	41	40Bad	61	52	49	47Don&apos;tknow	3	10	9	14Large Companies				Good	42	55	55	52Bad	50	38	34	33Don&apos;t know	7	7	11	15It will be seen that there is a rather greater difference between the &quot;immediate&quot;group and the remainder with regard to &quot;large companies&quot; than for &quot;tradeunions&quot; where a majority in all groups takes an unfavourable view. (Ref.tables 6d(iHvi).)6.9 Separate analysis shows that Trade Union membership is in fact higheramong the immediate&quot; group (40 %) than among other groups (&quot;against&quot; 31 %&quot;later&quot; 29%, &quot;uncertain&quot; 23%).

ANNEX HSTATE AID IN THE COUNTRIES VISITEDThis Annex contains accounts of the systems of state aid to the political parties in the four countries visited by the Committee, namely Austria, The federal republic of Germany, The Netherlands and Sweden.A.   AUSTRIABadwwmd1. Austria has a population of 7-4 million and an electorate of just over  million. There are 3 main political parties:- The SPO (Socialist Party) with some 700,000 members and dues of&apos;AS 15 (46p), 20 (61p) or more a month, depending on income.- The OVP (People&apos;s Party) 900,000 members with dues graded accordingto income.- The FPO (Freedom Party) with 35,000 members and dues aboutAS 10(31p)amonth.2. The Austrian electoral system is based on a complex form of proportional representation. There is one governing body, the National Assembly, composedof 183 members. Its composition at present is: SPO 93 seats; OVP 80 seats;FPO 10 seats. Below the Assembly are 9 Lander with their own assemblies inwhich the SPO, OVP and FPO are also the major parties; and below these the districts and municipalities.3. Direct general grants to political parties were introduced as recently as 1975.Over the last 12 years, however, state help to parties in one form or another hasbeen increasing: grants to the parties&apos; parliamentary groups were introduced in 1963; for &quot;information&quot; work in 1967; for publications in 1972; and for theparties&apos; political academies also in 1972.Sotaldles to Parliamentary Groups4. Since 1963, modest amounts have been paid to each parliamentary group(to qualify as a &quot;group&quot; a party must have at least 5 Members in the national assembly) to help parties discharge their parliamentary functions. The grantis based on a flat rate sum, plus an additional amount graded according to thenumber of a party*s Members. In 1967 an additional grant of 67% of theamounts paid under the 1963 Act was given to the parties to assist with the costof their &quot;information&quot; work, (ie despatch of letters, brochures, circulars to the electorate, etc). The parliamentary groups, rather than individual Members,have their owu offices and staff, except where the Member has a special individualfunction, eg the Speaker. The grants are for the partiamentary groups only andnot for general use by the parties.5. The grants, including administrative expenses, thus received by the parlia-mentary groups amount currently to about 23 million AS ( 707,000).
PcOrOcilPubDcatioAs6. Since 1972 AS 5 million ( 154,000) has been made available annuallytowards the cost of publishing political, cultural and religious brochures and periodicals.Pofltkml Academies7. Subsidies are paid under an Act of 1972to political academies or associationsset up by political parties represented in the National Assembly. These grants are intended to encourage the provision of political information, seminars,lectures and courses. They consist of a flat rate of AS 3 million ( 92,000) a year with additional amounts based on the number of seats held by the sponsoringparty in the National Assembly. The total amount of the additions may notexceed AS 20 million ( 614,000) in any one year.8. The academies foster close co-operation with the part/s central leadership,advising on political matters and providing an informed basis on which political decisions could be made. Special project groups of politicians and academicauthorities report on topical issues, for example, energy, education, and consti-tutional matters. It was claimed that these reports made a significant contri-bution to party debate.The Pottacal Party Act, 19759. General subsidies to the political parties in Austria were introduced by a federal Law of 2 Jury 197S, which gave for the first time a legal status to political parties and formally recognised that they played an indispensable role in theAustrian democratic system.10. The subsidies were designed to help the parties generally, but particularlyhi disseminating information on political, economic and social matters. A total,determined each year (AS 50 million ( 1-5 million) for 1976), is allocated asfoDows:(a) Each party with at least 5 Members receives a flat rate grant of as 4 million ( 123,000);(b) The remainder of the subsidy (at present AS 38 million ( 1 -2 million)is then distributed among all parties with at least one Member accord-ing to the votes obtained in the last elections;(e) Additionally, each party which, although not represented in theAssembly, has obtained more than 1% of the national vote receivesdaring an election year only a share of the remainder referred to in (6)above according to its share of votes cast. The Communist Party,which received about 1-05% of the vote, is the only party at presententitled to payment under this clause.11. Parties have to make a formal claim for payment. Any unclaimed moneyremaining in the AS 50 million ( 1-5 million) pool is shared among the other parties. The Communist Party has declared its opposition to the subsidy asa matter of principle and its entitlement of AS 100,000 ( 3,000) is to be distri-buted among the other parties. Parties receiving the subsidy have to presentaudited accounts of income and expenditure to the Federal Ministry of Finance.
12. Although the subsidy was not intended to be used by the parties specificallyon election campaigns, it is argued that parties continue to perform their normalfunction of providing information and guidance on political matters duringelection years; thus a fairly wide interpretation of this aspect of the 1975 lawappears to have been accepted.Arrangements at Land Level13. AH provincial governments assist the parties financially. Five provincessubsidise their parliamentary groups and four give general subsidies; sixprovinces also support the parties&apos; educational and informatioa work.14. We visited the Vienna Land Assembly which also serves as the Viennacity council. This Land is the most populous of the provinces. The parties therereceived in 1975-76 a total of AS 30 million ( 922,000) for &quot;civic education&quot;and AS 3 million ( 92,000) for administrative expenses.Reasons for introducing the 1975 subsidy15. We were told that the parties had found that costs had been increasing,particularly in the field of communications, and existing sources of income wereproving to be insufficient. There was also strong pressure to introduce legislation in order to ensure that parties published their accounts, and thereby make knownthe main sources of their finance.Public reaction16. The three main parties supported the introduction of the subsidies. we saw no evidence of significant public opposition either to the principle or themechanics of the scheme.Effects of subsidies on Party Financing17. It was too early to form any conclusions about the effects of the subsidy on party finances. The general subsidy was introduced only in 1975, and theearlier schemes were designed for specifically defined areas of party activity.18. During 1976 the parties will receive from the Federal budget the followingamounts:for parliamentary groups (1963 Act) AS 13-4 m ( 412,000)for information work (1967 Act) AS 8-9 m ( 273,000)for political academies (1972 Act) AS 28-9 m ( 888,000)for periodicals and brochures (1972 Act) AS 50 m ( 154,000)for &quot;public relations&quot; generally (1975 Act) AS 50 0 ra ( 1 -5 m)19.  The parties&apos; other main sources of income are:  membership dues;  a &quot;party tax&quot; levied on Members and other party functionaries;  income from property and commercial undertakings;  donations from industry; and  donations from the parties&apos; trade union groups
20. The SPO receives a higher proportion of its income from membership duesthan OVP, though it has fewer members, because it is highly centralised and thecentral party receives one-third of all membership dues. The small FPO has a relatively small membership, and before the 1975 Act was poorly placed finan-cially. It was not considered that party membership or political activity had been affected in any way by the subsidies. A high proportion (about 20 %) of the total population were members of a political party, and seemed to be undeterredeither by high subscriptions or the new public subsidy.21. The &quot;party tax&quot; on Members and party functionaries does not yield muchincome. SPO headquarters received in 1973 AS 1-8 million ( 55,000) (4-3% ofits total budget for that year) from about 200 Members and other party membersemployed on boards of nationalised industry etc who were required to contribute6% of their gross income. The OVP levied a tax of 10-25% of a functionary&apos;sgross income.22. Donations from industrial organisations have dropped recently becausethey are now subject to tax at 35%. This has had a marked effect on OVPfinances.23. The various wings of the trade union movement contributed to the funds of both main parties, although the SPO receives by far the largest contribution from this source.General reaction to the Subsidies24. There appeared to be general agreement that the subsidies were necessary.It was felt that there was much to be said for open financing of the parties,and the introduction of a general subsidy was considered to be the only way inwhich the party accounts could be made public.25. More broadly, Members of Parliament and others stressed the willingness of the Austrian people to pay a high price to ensure the continuance of democ-racy in their country. Their recent history and their proximity to Eastern Europehad made them particularly aware of how fragile democracy could be. Austriahad enjoyed social, industrial and political peace for a number of years, and thiswas thought to be at least partly because the achievements of democratic government had been properly explained to the public by the political parties.About 80-90% of all legislation has been unanimously agreed, and there was aconsistently high turn-out at elections.B.   THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANYBM&amp;gromd1. West Germany has a population of 62 million (including West Berlin) andan electorate of 41-5 million. The political parties&apos; representation in the bundestag is as follows:Social Democratic Party, SPD-230 fFree Democratic Party, FDP - 41 \  (Governing coalition)Christian Democratic Union, CDU  )Christian Social Union, CSU \  225 (opposition)
2. At national levels there are two parliamentary bodies,the Bundesrat and the bundestag. The Bundesrat is composed of representatives of the Lander. Allbills are submitted to it, and it has a right of veto over legislation which affects the rights of the Lander. The Bundestag is broadly the equivalent of the Houseof Commons. It consists of 518 members, but 22 of these sit for Berlin and haveadvisory functions only. The remaining 496 are elected in regular elections heldevery four years. Election is by proportional representation: each elector hastwo votes: the first for the constituency MP*, and the second for the party listin the Land. The first votes in the constituencies determine the constituency MP.The second votes determine the distribution of the MPs for the Land among theparties.3. There are 10 Lander, plus Berlin (which because of its &quot;occupied&quot; status istreated rather differently). Their governing assemblies, the Landtage, aresingle chamber and elected on somewhat the same system as the Bundestag.The parties in the Lander are the major national parties, except that in Bavariathe CDU leave the field to the CSV, a party which at the national level combineswith the CDU to form a joint Parliamentary party.4. Below the Lander there are further tiers of local authorities which we didnot examine. But at those levels also the major parties dominate the politicalscene.5. Political parties are recognised as part of the constitution. The Basic law of 1949 lays down (Article 21)-&quot;1. Political parties shall participate in the forming of the political will of the people. They may be freely established. Their internal organisationmust conform to democratic principles. They must publicly account forthe sources of their funds.2. Parties which, by reason of their aims or the behaviour of theiradherents, seek to impair or abolish the free democratic basic order or to endanger the existence of the Federal Republic of Germany, shall beunconstitutional. The Federal Constitutional Court shall decide on thequestion of unconstitutionality.3.  Details shall be regulated by federal laws.&quot;6. The Parties Law 1967 supplements the Basic Law and lays down, inter alia,fairly stringent requirements about the internal structure of parties; the Tightsof members; the timing and composition of the party congresses; the composi-tion, period of office and electoral procedures for their governing bodies; the procedures for the formulation of policies; and the regional and localorganisations.State aid to parties7. State aid generally takes the form of grants for election campaign expensesspread over four years, the bulk being paid in election years.&quot;NOTE: For convenience we use &quot;MP&quot; to signify a member of the Bundestag.
8.  We were informed that state aid was originally introduced for two reasons:(a) the extent of the dependence of parties on donations from institutions,especially companies, was regarded with apprehension; and(b) donations to parties were made taxable in 1968, thus reducing the willingness of individuals and institutions to contribute.9. State aid was introduced in the form of a 5 million DM ( 11 million) grant to parties for political education in 1959. By 1965 the grant had increased to38 rnillion DM ( 8-3 million) and was given for general activities but wasrestricted to the parties represented in the Bundestag. In 1966, however, theConstitutional Court ruled that these grants were unconstitutional. The Courtsaw the political parties as free competing organisations of society with politicalaims directed towards the state but acting independently of the state. It wasconsidered unconstitutional for the giving of direct continuous financial support to such social organisations to be obligatory on the state. On the other hand,the activity of the parties was necessary for the operation of Parliament and government. On the premise that elections were the medium through whichparties and their members qualified for state office, the Court ruled thatreimbursement of the necessary costs of an appropriate election campaignwould be admissible, provided that it was extended to smaller parties.10. Accordingly, the Parties Act 1967 laid down rules for subsidy throughadvance grants for election expenses, based on the performance of the parties concerned at the last election.11. The grants now take the following form. An agreed sum, at present3-50 DM (76p), for each elector is fixed by law. The total sum arrived at is thendivided according to the number of votes cast for each of the qualifying parties.To qualify a party must receive 0-5 % of the &quot;second&quot; votes, or 10 % of &quot;first&quot;votes cast in an electoral district if no Land list is submitted. Parties can qualify for aid without winning seats in the Bundestag, since to qualify for seats inthe Bundestag a party must poll 5 % of the &quot;second&quot; votes or gain constituenciesby direct election on the &quot;first&quot; vote.12. A similar procedure is followed for the Landtag elections but the sum pervote is 2-5 DM (54p) or, in a few Under, 1-5 DM (33p). Only in Bavaria, wewere told, was the amount reimbursed linked to the parties&apos; actual expenditure.13. Parties must make formal application for the grant, which is paid to thenational or Land headquarters in the following proportions over four years.At national level:First year after the relevant elections 0-0%Second year after the relevant elections 10^Third year after the relevant elections 15 %Fourth year just before the next election 35%Immediately after the election 40%
For the Lander elections, which are held every five years:First year after the elections 0-0%Second year after the elections 5 %Third year after the elections 10 %Fourth year after the elections 15 %Fifth year just before election 30%Fifth year just after election 40%14. The total amount of aid paid to the parties at national level in the years1973-76 inclusive was 145-6 million DM ( 32 million), and at Land level for theperiod 1970-75 inclusive it was some 100 million DM ( 22 million).15. Parties are required to render accounts only of sources of income; noexpenditure figures are required. Donations of over 20,000 DM ( 4,000)must be specified and the name and address of the donor given.State aid within Parliament16. In addition to state aid outside Parliament, money is provided for theparty groups (fraktionen) within the Bundestag. Each party group receives afiat rate grant and a grant scaled according to the number of seats. MPs arealso required by their parties to contribute a proportion of their salaries to theparty group. In total this income accounts for 15 % of the group&apos;s income, and state aid for about 85%. The grants for 1976 are approximately as follows:SDP 12 million DM ( 2-6 million)CDU/CSU    10 million DM ( 2-2 million)FDP 4 million DM ( 870,000)17. The money is spent on secretarial and research assistance etc, equipment and travelling expenses for the group. The SDP group employs about 135staff, the CDU 100, and the FDP 20. MPs also have individual allowances for secretarial and research work.Political research and education institutes18. National research and education institutes (Stiftung) are connected to each party and heavily subsidised from state funds. They are at both national and land level.19.  Generally the institutes&apos; work is in the following fields:  Political education for the public and for party workers. This iscarried out through seminars, courses, lectures etc, often at residentialcentres.  Research into topics of current interest eg housing, pollution, and immigration.  Aid to the &quot;third world&quot; countries with the aim of promoting under-standing and co-operation between nations.20. The institutes are largely financed by the state, but they receive some support from individual donations. The subsidies are apparently agreed by the
institutes and the appropriate Ministries and consist of a flat rate and a ratescaled according to the number of seats in the Bundestag. Any party gaining5% of the vote, that is, represented in the Bundestag, could receive a grant foran institute.Effect of state aid on parties21. State aid to the parties is on a generous scale. The aid for election expensescomes to some 30% of the parties&apos; income. If aid to the parliamentary and land party groups, grants to the institutes, youth organisations etc are included,the proportion could be as high as 60%.22. Standards of party accommodation and staf&amp;ng generally appear to be high.23. Neither membership numbers nor membership income had declinedbecause of state aid. All parties mentioned that they had increased membershipconsiderably since 1970. They all keep in regular touch with their members,generally by means of a monthly party magazine, the cost of which is includedin the membership subscription.24. At local level parties are organised in fairly small units, and membershipactivity is on the whole political rather than financial. Little time is spent raisingmoney by bazaars, jumble sales, lotteries etc. Dues are collected personallyor by bankers&apos; orders. The parties also appeal for donations, since there aretax concessions on donations of up to 600 DN ( 130). Much of members&apos;time seems to be spent in political discussion at seminars, conferences andevening classes.25. There is rarely much opposition to proposals to increase membershipdues. We were told that membership might drop away temporarily when dueswere increased, but it usually soon recovers.26. Most membership dues are collected locally and passed up to headquartersthrough the various levels, with a percentage being deducted at each levelalthough the Land parties of the SPD do not receive any money from sub-prescriptions. MPs also pay a fairly large proportion of their income, between 12%and 23%.Attitude towards state aid27. We formed the general impression that state aid to parties was not nowcontroversial. While people generally might not go along with assertions thatthis amount of money was absolutely vital to keep democracy alive, there didseem to be a measure of agreement that parties were necessary to democracy,and that they needed adequate funds in order to operate effectively. A lot ofstress was laid on the parties&apos; educative role through party politics and electoralcampaigns.28. We were also told of the importance of state aid in ensuring that parties were free of institutional pressures and making them more dependent on electoral success. The role played by business contributions in the early years
of the Nazi movement is still remembered. Party leaders also stressed that stateaid gave all partieB an equal opportunity.I forming the presentgoverning coalition29. The further point made was that because parties were economically in-dependent, wealthy individuals could no longer &quot;buy&quot; themselves a place onthe party lists for elections. Concern was, however, frequently expressed aboutthe high cost of election campaigns.C.   THE NETHERLANDSBwigrooBd1. The Netherlands has a population of 13-6 million and an electorate of9 million. The Dutch parliament consists of two chambers. The First Chamberis elected by the States Provincial (one of the major tiers of local authorities);the Second Chamber, which comprises 150 members, is broadly the equivalent of the House of Commons. Ministers sit in the Second Chamber but are not members, and, if elected, have to resign on taking up Ministerial posts. Themembers are elected by proportional representation on national lists.2. There are 70 registered political parties in The Netherlands; 20 partiesput forward candidates in the 1972 General Election and 15 parties are nowrepresented in the Second Chamber. The largest parties are:Labour Party (PvdA) 43 seats tCatholic Peopled Party (KVP) 27Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) 14Political Radical Party (percent) 7Democrats &apos;66 (D66) 6Liberal Party (VVD) 22Christian Historical Union (CHU)     6  ,,Conmiunist Party (cp ) financial Situation of Parties3. Membership dues form the parties&apos; main source of income, even though thelevel of membership has been falling in most parties. The Labour Party receivelittle, if any, support from the trade unions, but the Liberal Party does receive some business donations. Private donations to the parties are common, andsuch gifts may in certain circumstances qualify for tax relief.4. Not all the parties publish accounts, but it seems that the major parties are currently receiving income from membership subscriptions as follows:Labour Party-100,777 members (131,000 in 1968)* paying an annualfee of Fls 4-30 ( 0-88) to Fls 58 ( 11-80) according to income. Theaverage membership fee is Fls 45 ( 9*26).Catholic Party-100,000 members (220,000 in 1968) paying an annual feeof Fls 15 ( 3) to Fls 69 ( 14) according to income.Liberal Party-83,210 members (figures for 1968 were not available)paying an annual fee of Fls 12-50 ( 2-55) to Fls 50 ( 1018) accordingto age.*Party membership figures for 1968 are taken from the PEP study by Henig and Pinder&quot;European Political Parties&quot;.
Anti-Revolutionary Parry-o9,000 members (93,000-100,000 members in1968) paying an annual fee of Fls 24 ( 4-90) to Fls 125 ( 25-50).Christian Historical Union-30,000 members (45,000 in 1968) paying, on average, an annual fee of Fls 16-50 ( 3-36).5. Party finances are generally centralised. Membership dues are usuallycollected centrally by post, although one or two small parties may still collectthem locally. The local party organisations appear weak by United Kingdomstandards. They are normally staffed by volunteers, run from private premises and supported financially by their headquarters.Existing State AidFacilities in the Second Chamber6. In addition to their salaries, Deputies receive travel, telephone and postalallowances.7.  The following grants are made from state funds:(a) Fls 1,060 ( 216) a month is paid to individual Deputies to defray thecost of secretarial and other assistance. This represents about one-third of the cost of employing a fun-time secretary. There are proposals to raise this allowance to the equivalent of one-half of this cost.(6) A scaled contribution is provided towards the cost of running thepolitical secretariats of each parliamentary party. The grant is calcu-lated as follows. The annual allowance (Fls 1,000 ( 204) for a floorleader (ie Chairman of a party group) plus Fls 300 ( 61) for eachDeputy in the group up to a maximum of Fls 10,000 ( 2,037) ismultiplied by a factor which is agreed annually (66-75 in 1975). Thishas at present the effect of providing a maximum of about  136,000for any one party; there is no weighting for opposition parties.Radio and Television8. All parties represented in the Second Chamber get an equal share of freeradio and television time. During election campaigns every party putting forward nation-wide lists of candidates receives free television and radiotime and a partial reimbursement of technical expenses. In addition to thesebroadcasts there is extensive news coverage of political affairs and the proceed-ings of Parliament are televised.Financial Aid to Research Institutes9. Aid for the parties&apos; research institutes was introduced in 1972, with retro-spective effect to 1970. In 1972 there were five such institutes, run by the Labour,Liberal, Catholic, ARP and CHU parties, but since then the number hasincreased to seven.10. The aid consists of an annual state grant which, taken with the other income of the institute, is intended to cover its estimated expenditure. If the institutecan itself raise enough income to cover all its expenditure it does not get a stategrant A party&apos;s grant is scaled also according to the number of Deputies
representating the party in the Second Chamber, and may not exceed theinstituted income from other sources. Part of the grant is given in advance, tocover estimated expenditure; and the final sum is determined retrospectively.The grants are given on certain general conditions: a research institute must berecognised by a party which is represented in the Second Chamber (each partycan recognise only one institute); it must have a corporate status; make itsaccounts open to government audit; and must carry out academic research in furtherance of the party&apos;s political objectives. In 1975-76 the grants to theinstitutes totalled Fls 1,520,000 ( 312,000).11. We did not visit any of these institutes, but we understand that they areoccupied principally with party political research. This is mainly concerned withgeneral, longer term topics rather than with briefing for the party&apos;s Deputies in parliamentary debates. Their reports are published and are thus subject to public scrutiny and comment.12. Each institute has a governing body or bodies, composed of leading partymembers, Deputies and academics. The number of staff varies, probablyaccording to the strength of the party and the size of its subsidy. The Labourinstitute is the largest with 12 paid staff and is said to be able to call on theservices of up to a thousand volunteers. Some staff are employed full-time,and some part-time. The institutes&apos; reports may be compiled by professionalstaff alone, or, more usually, the institute might provide the secretariat forcommittees formed to consider a particular topic.13. We were assured that party money formerly used for research was not nowbeing diverted to other party activities. The institutes have a tradition of separatefunding, have their own governing bodies, and publish their own separateaccounts.14. We found general acceptance of the need for each party to carry outresearch and policy formulation and the need to support these activities with public money. As with the United Kingdom parties, Dutch experience is thatresearch activities are among the first to be cut when a party is short of money.We were unable to judge, however, how far the quality of Dutch politics, or political debate among party members or the public, had improved as a resultof state aid to the research institutes.Financial Aid to Edacational Institutes15. In 1975 the Government authorised the payment of state funds to the educational institutes of political parties. At present there are only four suchinstitutes, belonging to the Labour and Catholic parties, the ARP and the WD.Since the introduction of the aid, however, other parties might well be en-couraged to establish their own institutes.16. As with the research institutes, an educational institute, in order to qualify for a grant, must be recognised by a political party represented fn Parliament;it must have corporate status and make its accounts books available to govem-ment auditors.
17. There is no requirement that the grant shall be matched by income fromother sources. The grant is set at 90% of total expenditure up to FIs 30,000( 6,000) reducing to 70 % of expenditure above that amount. Each party&apos;s grantis subject to a ceiling based on the number of its parliamentary representatives.The total amount allowed for in the 1976 budget is FIs 1,970,000 ( 400,000).18. The educational institutes run courses, conferences and seminars for partyworkers and party members generally, youth and women&apos;s organisations, and prospective parliamentary and local authority candidates. Dutch schools norm-ally provide a rather more formal education in politics than is the practice in theUnited Kingdom, and the political parties are sometimes asked to assist in this.19. It was too early to judge the effects of state aid in this field. But the factthat other parties were now starting to organise educational institutes, and thatthose existing in 197S had increased their professional staff, suggests that this isan expanding area of activity.Attitudes to Farther or Different forms of State Aid20. We were told that the political parties in The Netherlands were in financial difficulties, but it was difficult for us to assess just how serious these might be.The formation of new political parties has traditionally been comparatively easyin The Netherlands, and some parties that have grown rapidly have collapsed as quickly. Any extension of aid to include grants for the parties&apos; general use would therefore pose problems in deciding which parties should qualify for payment.D. SWEDENBackground1. Sweden has a population of 8-2 million and an electorate of about 6 million.The Riksdag (parliament) was reconstituted in 1970, the First and SecondChambers being replaced by a single Chamber of 350 members, directly elected for three years. The electoral system is one of proportional representationwith 28 constituencies electing 310 members from parties who have eitherreceived 4% of the national vote or 12% of the votes cast in their constituency.The remaining 40 seats are distributed among those parties which have received4% of the national vote. The Social Democratic Party has formed all or partof the government for 40 years. The party strengths in the current Riksdag areas follows:Social DemocratsLiberalsModerates (Conservatives)CentreVPK (Communists)Current Subsidies for the Political Parties2. Public aid to the political parties is given on a national (state support)and a regional and local (communal support) level. State support was introduced- 156- 34- 51- 90- 19
rin 1965 and partly reconstructed in 1972; the amounts paid have been successivelyincreased, the current amounts being set in 1975. Party support at local govern-ment level was introduced in 1969, the amounts being determined by theindividual local authorities.State Support3. State support is provided in two forms: national support, which is a generalparty subsidy, and staff support, which is intended to defray expenditure bythe parties on the secretariats of their parliamentary groups.National Support4. This subsidy is currently fixed at 115,000 Kr ( 14,000) annually per seat inthe Riksdag. In order to avoid serious fluctuations in the level of the subsidy,the amounts payable are based on the two immediately preceding general elections. In the first year of the 3-year period following a general election,each party receives a subsidy relating to one-sixth of the number of seatsobtained in the last election plus five-sixths of the number obtained in the immediately preceding election. In the second year, the subsidy is based on one-half of the seats won in both elections. In the third year, a party&apos;s subsidyrelates to five-sixths of the seats obtained in the last election phis one-sixthof those won in the immediately preceding election.5. National support is also provided for those parties which are not represented in the Riksdag but which obtained more than 2-5 % of the total vote at the lastgeneral election. For each tenth of 1 % above 2-5 % the party receives 115,000Kr( 14,000). Any party qualifying for representation in one constituency on thebasis of 12$% of votes cast in that constituency also receives one-fourteenth of basic support (see paragraph 6) for each member returned.Staff Support6. This assistance takes two forms basic and additional support. The basicsupport amounts to 2,025,000 Kr ( 255,000) paid annually to each partyrepresented in the Riksdag. Additional support is paid on the same basis but ata rate of 5,650 Kr ( 710) for every seat obtained if the party is represented ingovernment, and 8,500 Kr ( 1,069) for each seat if it is notReviews7. Subsidies are reviewed regularly, the latest increase being made in the autumn of 1975. A total amount of 57 million Kr ( 7-2 million) in state support for theparties was proposed by the Government for 1975-76.Communal Party Support8. Financial aid for parties represented in the county and municipal councilswas introduced in 1969. The communes are able to set the level of subsidy atany level they choose, but the amount of money per seat held must always be the same for each party; no distinction can be made between majority orminority parties represented on the Council. All 23 counties and all but two ofthe 278 municipalities have introduced some degree of subsidy. In 1976 the
counties will pay a total of 22-5 million Kr ( 2-8 million) and in 1974 themunicipalities paid 38-5 million Kr ( 4-8 million) in communal party support.Origins of the Parry Subsidies9. In the early 1960s the financial difficulties of the Swedish newspaper industry were critical. Most Swedish newspapers had close links with the political parties and in 1963 a Royal Commission recommended that aid should be given to thepress through the political parties. Legislation was subsequently introduced for the payment of the subsidies, directly and unconditionally, to the parties.10. Following the report of a Royal Commission, arrangements for thepayment of state aid to the political parties were first made by the Riksdag in1965, and took effect from 1 January 1966. The arrangements included provisionfor national support, payable to parties which received at least 4 % of the nationalvote; and staff support, which was paid at a higher rate to opposition parties.11. In 1969 a law was passed enabling the counties and municipalities toprovide fiiytfiriai aid to parties represented in their governing bodies. Aidis allocated according to the number of seats held, but the amount per seatis deterrnined by the local authority. By 1971 all the counties and 90% of themunicipalities had introduced schemes.12. In June 1971 a government committee was set up to examine the supportbeing given to the parties. The cornmittee reported in April 1973, unanimouslyreconunewung immediate increases in the national support for parties, whichuntil then had remained almost unchanged since 1966. National support wasalso to be provided for parties not represented in parliament but which hadreceived at least 2-5% of the vote in the most recent election. Staff supportwas to be supplemented by the introduction of a basic support for each partyrepresented in parliament that had obtained 4% of the votes cast in the latestelection. In order to ensure security for party employees and to facilitateforward planning by the parties, the changes in grants consequent upon electiongains and losses were to be introduced gradually. No changes were recom-mended in the type of support provided at regional and local level. Thecommittee&apos;8 report was accepted by parliament and the new rules took effecton 1 July 1972.Principles on which Current Schemes are Based13. The system of party subsidy has been based on four principles whichwere reaffirmed by the 1971 Committee. These basic principles are:(a) aid should be given only to those parties which have demonstratedin general elections that they can command a significant level of support;(h) the subsidies are to be calculated and allocated according to fixedrules in order to rule out the possibility of preferential treatment;(c) the amounts of support should be related to the relative electoralstrengths of the parties; and Id) there should be no public control over the ways in which the partiesuse the support.
14. The roles governing the qualifying conditions and the allocation of fundshave ensured that the first three principles are observed. The fourth principle,that of complete independence for the parties on how the money is spent, hasalso been strictly applied. For example, whilst the staff support scheme was originally intended for party activity within the Riksdag, the parties are in factable to spend the money as they wish.Party AttftsvJes towards State Aid15. Opinion in the Moderate (Conservative) Party in the early 1960s had apparently been divided over the question of principle involved in the sub-sidising of political parties. In recent years, however, the party has come toaccept the principle of state aid, although it never takes the initiative in pressing for increases in the amounts paid, either at state or local level. The other mainparties were unanimous in their support of party subsidies. One of the&quot; minorparties, the Christian Democratic Party, said that although they accepted theprinciple of state aid, they thought that the threshold of 2-5 % of the national vote(150,000 votes) was unfair; the Christian Democratic Party had polled only &apos;8% of the vote and therefore did not receive aid at national level, although they did receive aid at municipal level.Effects of State Aid16. In recent years the amounts received by the parties by way of publicsubsidies have increased considerably, and now represent a very high proportionof the parties&apos; income. State support received by the parties now accounts, forexample, for 37% of the Moderate Party&apos;s central income; 65% of that of theSocial Democratic Party; 75% of that of the Liberal Party; and 88% of thatof the Centre Party.17. AU the parties claimed that their membership levels had remainedunaffected by public subsidy. Only the Liberal Party has been losing members in recent years. The normal practice is for membership dues to be collectedlocally and then transferred, via the regional organisations, to the centrewith a percentage being deducted at each stage. Special fund-raising campaignswere run in election years, but there was some evidence to suggest that sincethe introduction of the subsidies voluntary donations over and above the membership fee had been falling off in real terms.18. The Social Democratic Party at all levels received large donations fromtrade unions in election years. No direct contributions are received from theunions in non-election years, but the party and the unions sometimes conductjoint campaigns on subjects of interest to them both and the costs of thesecampaigns are shared. About 70% of party members are trade unionists, andthey pay the same dues and have the same privileges and responsibilities as other members.19. The Moderate Party still receive considerable financial support frombusiness firms at all levels, particularly at local level, but contributions fromthis source decreased in real terms following the introduction of the subsidiesin 1966. The Liberal Party decided soon after 1966 that they would accept nofurther contributions from business firms.
20. All the parties agreed that the subsidies were now essential to them, andsome could well disappear if the subsidies were to be withdrawn. The SocialDemocratic Party did organise fund-raising lotteries, but there was little evidence that the parties generally were making any great efforts to raise money from voluntary sources.21. The parties maintained that as a result of public subsidies they were nowable to operate at a much more professional level, and could stand comparisonwith other organisations in Sweden. All had been able to increase their staff and provide far more information to their members and the public generally.Although the parties seemed to make much of being &quot;folk movements&quot;, there appeared to be no strong tradition of voluntary service within the parties.With the introduction of the subsidies, however, they had been able to increase their contact with the public, although this was mainly done through thedistribution of written material, organised chains of telephone calls at elections and discussion groups and seminars at other times. The parties were in nodoubt that this increased activity was in the interests of parliamentarydemocracy.22. Sweden has a tradition of high turnouts at elections, and with theiradditional finance the parties said they were now able to maintain political activity at local level during non-election years. The local membership was brought into the policy formation process; papers prepared at the centre werenormaHy issued to the regional and local parties who were invited to commentupon them. These comments were taken into account at the centre before anyparticular policy was finally decided. The effectiveness of these proceduresdepended a great deal on an efficient organisation and a substantial flow ofinformation from the centre. The parties claimed that these could not beprovided without the financial backing provided by the subsidies.Effects of Command Aid23. We were told that participation in local government affairs had recentlybeen the subject of intensive discussions and investigation. Recent reformshas resulted in the creation of larger authorities and fewer councillors. A sense of remoteness had developed and the government hoped to counteract thisby giving an impetus to the creation of neighbourhood councils and bystrengthening the position of councillors, for example, by giving them thestatutory right to leave of absence from work.24. It was considered that the communal subsidy had done much to equip thepolitical parties for their job of involving people in the political life of the regions and municipalities. There had been increased political activity at locallevel and much better training of party workers; local councillors were nowable to prepare themselves adequately on local issues.25. Many local parties were now largely self-financing and had thereby become more independent of their central organisations. The amounts of communalsubsidy varied, however, from area to area, according to decisions takenindependently by the individual authorities. As a result, some of the localparties continued to be supported by their party&apos;s central organisation. The
Communist Party, for example, passed on about 800,000 Kr ( 100,000) of itsannual state subsidy of 4-3m Kr ( 541,000) on to those local parties that receivedonly modest amounts of communal aid, either because of their low vote inthe area or because the local subsidy was set at a low level.Accountability26. Annual payment of the national subsidies is made nominally to thenational organisations of the parties on receipt of a written application.Regional and municipal subsidies are paid to the parties at those levels. Theparties have the right to use their subsidies in any way they choose and there isno accountability to Parliament as to how the money is spent. We were assured that the financial organisations of the local parties would ensure that the subsidies were put to proper use.
ANNEX IOVERSEAS SCHEMES OF STATE AID FOR POLITICALPARTIESAn account of the systems of state aid to political parties in the four countriesvisited by the Committee is given in Annex H. This Annex contains a brief account of the extent of state aid in a further eight countries: Canada, Denmark,Finland, France, Italy, Japan, Norway and the United States of America.A. Caaada1. A system of financial aid to the political parties was introduced in canadian  1974 (Canada Elections Act), although at a provincial level Quebec hadbeen operating a scheme of partial reimbursement of candidates&apos; election expenses since 1963.2- Under the 1974 Act Federal candidates who are elected or receive at least15% of the votes cast can receive a partial reimbursement of their election expenses. Tax. credits (ie a deduction from taxes otherwise payable) up to amaximum of $500 ( 290) in any one year are allowed to taxpayers contributing to political parties and candidates. It is estimated that the cost of the taxconcessions is about $20 million ( 11-5 million) in an election year, and about$10 million ( 5-7 million) in a non-eleclion year.3. As regards aid to the parties generally, assistance with the cost of salaries for the parties&apos; research staff is based on the extent of their representation inParliament. In 1975 1671,400 ( 388,000) was made available to the four mainparties. In addition, free accommodation, stationery and office equipment isprovided.4. The Member&apos;s constituency office is also subsidised at the annual rate of$7,200 ( 4,000) for staff and $3,600 ( 2,000) for rent. Free stationery and government printing facilities are also available to the constituency offices.Total aid for constituency offices at present amounts to $1,750,000 ( 1 million)a year.5. The 1974 Act also limits the amount of expenses that parties and candidatesmay incur at an election and includes provision for public disclosure ofcontributions.6. The bulk of party expenditure in Canada takes place during elections.Candidates are noniinated immediately prior to an election, and local con-stituency organisations tend to be inactive between elections.7. It is expected that the disclosure provisions will lead to the major partieshaving to broaden the base of their financial support, but there has so far been no marked fall in the parties&apos; total income from voluntary sources. It is hopedthat the new law will encourage the development of more active party organisations.
B. Denmark1. In 1968 a system of aid was introduced in Denmark whereby a certainsum of money is paid monthly to each party group in the Folketing (Parliament)to enable the group to employ secretaries, pay for expert assistance and advice on technical questions, and buy office equipment and literature. The amountallocated to each group is divided into two parts, one fixed and the othervariable, in proportion to the number of Folketing seats held by the partyconcerned. Both amounts are tied to the cost of living index and are adjustedaccordingly every six months. Total payments now amount to rather morethan 61 million Kronen ( 593,000) a year, shared among the 10 political partiesrepresented in the Folketing.2. Although the subsidies are intended for the use of the parties in Parliament,there appears to be no detailed control over the way the money is spent.&quot;3. At parliamentary elections the parties recognised by the Ministry of theInterior as contesting the election are granted equal amounts of free radio and television time.C. Finland1. A system of subsidies to the political parties was introduced in Finland in1967 because party income, which came mainly from members&apos; dues, contribu-tions from supporters and the voluntary fund-raising activities of members,was proving insufficient to meet rising costs. And, as in Sweden, the newspapersattached to the political parties were in need of additional financial support.2. The subsidies are voted as a separate item in the budget each year. Forthe first 6 years the total amount paid was 10 million marks ( 1,445,000) ayear; since 1973 this has been increased to 16 million marks ( 2,311,000) a year.The money is distributed in proportion to the number of Members of Parliamentfrom each party. A subsequent law has provided that if more than half theMembers of Parliament belonging to any party break away from that party toform a new one, the new party can receive the subsidies for these Members.3. Initially, much of the party subsidy was used to support party newspapers,but these are now covered by a separate item in the budget concerning subsidies for the press. The parties&apos; youth and teenage organisations receive separatefunds under a different budget item and women&apos;s organisations are also sup-ported. Party finances also benefit indirectly from budgetary aid to other organ-isations and activities, for example sporting organisations which in Finland arepolitical in character. The budget proposals for parties subsidies in 1976 areas follows:-Direct party support FMK 16 million ( 2,311,000)Party press subsidies FMK 13-5 million ( 1,950,000)Party Parliamentary Offices      FMK 1 million ( 144,000)4. The party subsidies are paid directly to the party offices which decide how they are to be used. The parties have to account for how the money has been spent. There are, however, few restrictions, and any normal party activities are considered acceptable.
D.  france. State subsidies have so far been generally confined to assisting individualcandidates in their election campaigns.2. In communes of less than 2,500 inhabitants candidates pay their own cam-paign costs. In communes of 2,500 to 9,000 inhabitants the Commission dePropagande, set up at the teginnmg of each election, distributes manifestosand voting papers at public expense. In communes of over 9,000 inhabitantsthe state pays the cost of paper, the printing of voting papers, and the printing and distribution of posters and manifestos for candidates obtaining at least5% (in some cases 10%) of the vote in one of the two rounds of the ballot(in the first round in towns of over 30,000 inhabitants).3. If a candidate for the Presidency receives at least 5 % of the vote he is paid a lump sum of 100,000 F ( 12,000) towards his campaign costs. In addition,each presidential candidate is allowed two hours of free television and broad-casting time for each of the two successive rounds of ballots. The parties also receive a certain amount of indirect subsidy from the budgets of the assembly and Senate.E.  italy. A system of public subsidies to Italian political parties was introduced bylaw in 1974. This legislation provides for aid to be given to the parties in theform of Electoral and Organisational Funds.2. A sum of 15 billion lire ( 10 rnillion) is paid from an Electoral Fund at each general election to all parties participating in elections to the Chamber of deputies (Lower House) in at least two-thirds of the constituencies, provided they have one or more candidates elected and obtain at least 300,000 votes or % of the votes cast. 15% of the total sum is shared equally amongst the qualifying parties, the remaining 85 % being distributed according to the numberof votes obtained.3. An annual sum of 45 billion lire ( 30 million) is also made available froman Organisational Fund for the day-to-day running of the parties. This sum isinitially divided between the two Houses of Parliament, 15 billion lire ( 10million) going to the Senate and 30 billion lire ( 20 million) to the Chamberof Deputies. 2% of the fund is snared equally amongst the national parties.A farther 23% is also shared equally, but with special provision for Indepen-deots and linguistic and ethnic minority parties. The remaining 75 % is dividedproportionately amongst all parties represented in Parliament, according tothe number of seats gained in the preceding general election.4. Each party secretary is required to publish an annual balance sheet specifyingall party income, with the exception of private donations of less than 1 minionlire ( 670). Balance sheets must be submitted for checking to both the Presidentof the Chamber of Deputies and the President of the Senate.5. Public Corporations, State Holding Corporations and companies in whichthe state holds 20% or more of the shares, either directly or indirectly, areforbidden to contribute to party funds.
6. There was general agreement amongst the main parties in 1974 on the urgent need for legislation on party financing. Only the Liberals voted against it.They saw the subsidies as a threat to party autonomy; and as favouring thelarger parties, and discouraging the formation of new ones. They also objected to the payment of public funds to extremist parties.7. The systems of state aid introduced in 1974 have not proved popular. Apublic opinion poll published in October 1974 showed that 54% of Italiansdisapproved of the law and only 7% were unequivocally in favour. A furtherpoll in January 1975 indicated increased disapproval. In the autumn of 1974 aNational Committee, supported by the Liberal Party and other political groups,was formed to promote a referendum on whether the law on the public financing of political parties should be repealed.F.  japan. Japanese political parties do not receive direct aid from public fundsalthough research staff are provided to assist the various committees. Two newlaws-the Revised Public Elective Offices Law and the Revised Political FundsControl Law-passed in July 1975, and effective from 1 January 1976, providefor limited public assistance for election candidates and simultaneously intro-duced some restrictions on election advertising and controls on party contri-butions.2. The Revised Public Elective Offices Law provided that elections would hence-forth be partly financed by the state, and all candidates provided with a free carfor electioneering, posters and a fixed amount of political advertising. At thesame time restrictions have been placed on advertising by candidates&apos; supportorganisations, and on the free distribution of party newspapers.3. The Revised Political Funds Control Law placed limits on donations by companies or individuals to parties, political groups, or election candidates.For individuals the total permitted contribution is Y20 million ( 38,000) per year. For companies and trade unions the maximum contribution is limited,according to the amount at which the company is capitalised or the member-ship of the union.4. Donations to an individual politician or political group are limited to smalleramounts. Membership fees to party organisations are counted as contributions.These restrictions do not apply to gifts from political groups or from legacies.Organisations in receipt of public money in aid or subsidy may not givecontri-butions within one year of receiving that aid or subsidy. Companies whichhave been running at a loss for three years or more may not contribute untilthat loss has been made good. Foreigners and foreign companies are not permitted to make contributions.5. Parties and funding bodies are required to submit to the Ministry of HomeAffairs an annual list recording the origin of all contributions totalling overV 10,000 ( 19). Individual political groups or support organisations for indi-vidual politicians must make similar returns in respect of contributions totallingover T 1 million ( 2,000). All political parties must publish their accounts bythe end of March each year.
6. The changes in the law were aimed at ending the parties&apos; dependence on business interests for their income and making it necessary for them to seekincreased financial support from individual members of the public. It was thought that this would be more democratic and create more public participation in politics. The new arrangements will be reviewed in five years&apos; time with aview to further hastening the eventual abolition of business contributions.7. It is probably too early to judge the effects of the new laws on party finances.It has been claimed that by intjoducing limited state support for election pur-poses the need for massive spending by the parties has been removed, althoughothers have argued that substantial private election funds will still be necessary.G. Norway1. Public subsidies to political parties were introduced in Norway in 1970.Grants are paid to parties which put up candidates in more than 50% of constituencies and are represented in Parliament. The subsidy is allocated accord-ing to the number of votes and seats won by each party at the preceding generalelection. In 1973 a total of 11 million Kroner( l,000,000)wasdistributedinthisway. The money is paid to the parties&apos; central organisations but from January1976 additional payments, also based on election results, will be made to localparty organisations.2. Party Information Organisations receive substantial sums for runningeducational courses (for example, the Information Offices for the Centre party and the Christian People*s Party received Kr 70,000 ( 7,000) and Kr 194,000( 19,400) respectively in 1974. Each of the parties&apos; press offices receives a subsidy of Kr 82,500 ( 8,250) a year irrespective of party size. In addition, the parties&apos;youth organisations are subsidised and grants are given towards the costs oftelecommunications.3. Free secretarial and other staff assistance is available to all Members ofParliamentH. The United states. Subsidies for Presidential candidates were introduced in the United states in 1974 when amendments to the 1971 Federal Election Campaign Act were introduced. Campaign costs had been increasing markedly, and the traditionalsystem of campaign financing had proved inadequate.2. In addition to providing for the Federal financing of Presidential elections,the new law also set limits on contributions from supporters and on expenditure by candidates. The provisions of the 1974 Act are administered by the FederalElections Commission.3. The main provisions of the law dealing with the public financing of parties and candidates are as follows:(a) Presidential elections. The nominees of the two major parties auto-matically qualify for grants of $22 million ( 12-3 million) each.Nominees of minor parties are eligible for a proportion of this amount
if their party&apos;s candidate received at least 5 % of the vote in the preceding -ing election. If a candidate opts for public funding he is not permitted to accept private contributions, although his party can spend up toabout $3 million ( 1-7 million) on his behalf.(6) Presidential nominating conventions. The major parties automaticallyqualify for about $2 million ( 1-1 million) each. Minor parties wouldqualify for lesser amounts based on votes received in the precedingelection.(c) Presidential primaries. Matching publicfundsareprovidedforqualify-ing candidates. In order to qualify for a grant each candidate is requiredto raise $5,000 ( 2,800) in each of 20 states in individual contributions of not more than $250 ( 140). This $100,000 ( 56,000), plus the first$250 of all other individual contributions, is then matched withFederal funds up to a manvnrnnfr of 45-5 million ( 3 million). Onlyfunds raised after 1 January 1975 qualified for matching public money for the 1976 election.4. The Federal money for the public funding of campaigns comes from the presidential Election Campaign Fund which was established in 1971. Citizensare able to indicate on their anmial tax form that they wish $1 (56p) ($2 for a married couple) to be appropriated to the fund. After a slow start it is estimatedthat the tax check-off scheme will have produced $96 million ( 53-8 million)in the four years up to 1976.5. The new law also established limits on voluntary contributions. Noindividual is now allowed to give more than $1,000 ( 560) directly to anycandidate for each stage of the election, and no more than $25,000 ( 14,000)annually to all Federal candidates. No organisation may contribute more than$5,000 ( 2,800) for each election. However, a 1976 Supreme Court rulinginvalidated the 1974 law provision restricting &quot;independent&quot; expenditure byany individual in support of a candidate to $1,000 ( 560).6. Candidates are required to report details of all contributions received tothe Federal Elections Commission without delay. The Commission then make this information available to the public almost immediately.7. Although the US Congress has for some time provided generous funds forthe employment by Congressmen of aides and research assistants, the 1976elections are the first to be publicly financed.
