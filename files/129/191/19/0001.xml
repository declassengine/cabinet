EXPENDITURE COMMITTEEGOVERNMENT OBSERVATIONS ON THIRD REPORTSESSION 1973-74POSTGRADUATE EDUCATIONIntroduction1. In their Third Report, Session 1973-74, the Expenditure Committee putforward a number of recommendations about the financing and administrationof postgraduate education. Their recommendations were wide-ranging andsome of them raised fundamental questions about the purpose of postgraduateeducation and the roles of the various bodies concerned with the system of higher education in this country. This system is highly decentralised, with-agreat deal of responsibility exercised by autonomous bodies such as the univer-necessities and research councils, and by local education authorities. The Secretaryof State for Education and Science is responsible for overall policy, but it is part and parcel of the system that policy making on major issues should beundertaken in full partnership with the various bodies concerned. consequently it was not possible for the Government to express a view on the recommenda-tions of the Expenditure Committee without first collecting and considering the opinions of the relevant bodies in the field.2. This process in fact got under way very soon after the Report appearedat the end of January 1974. But it soon became apparent that many of the bodies concerned were not content to comment on the recommendations as they stood.They considered it necessary to think through some of the fundamental policy issues involved. Thus the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals(CVCP) set up a working party in November 1974 which produced an interimreport in July 1975, and which is continuing to give the matter further study.The Science Research Council (SRC) set up a working patty in March 1974which produced a report in September 1975: the Council are now assessing the reaction to this report. Thus a far-reaching public debate is still in process, butit now appears to the Government that the point has now been reached wherethe Government are able to outline their own position. This is the purpose ofthis White Paper. It does not attempt to answer all the questions about post-graduate education: it does set out the Goverumenfs present attitude on the issues raised by the Expenditure Committee.3. These issues have been grouped under three headings-the objectives ofpostgraduate education; the content, type and balance of the courses offered;and administrative and financial arrangements. There then remains a numberof miscellaneous recommendations made by the Expenditure Committee: theseare dealt with in an Annex.The Objectives of Postgraduate Education4. The term &quot;postgraduate education&quot; covers a wide variety of activitiesleading to a wide variety of qualifications. Underlying this variety, however,the broad objectives of postgraduate education may be summarised as:(i) the training of men and women in the skills and attitudes required to
meet the future needs of industry and commerce, the professions, thepublic services and, of course, the higher education institutions them-selves (&quot;manpower needs&quot;);(ii) the satisfaction of the demand from students who, in the words of theCVCP&apos;s interim report, are &quot;qualified, suitable and keen to proceedbeyond a first degree&quot; (&quot;individual demand&quot;);(iii) the contribution which research students while still under training make as a manpower resource to the advancement of knowledge or to the research capability of an institution (&quot;institutional demand&quot;).There is a separate range of objectives related to overseas students: aid for developing countries, improvement of international relations, building up goodwill amongst people who will one day be in a position to buy British goods and,perhaps, attracting foreign exchange. The Government do not question thedesirability of making provision for overseas students. The problem is however to decide, in relation to other desirable objectives both inside and outside the educational sphere, what resources the country can afford to devote to thispurpose and what return can be expected from an investment of this kind. this aspect of the matter has been covered, so far as the academic year 1977-78 isconcerned, by the Government^ announcement of 5 July. The following para-graphs are concerned mainly with the objectives as they affect home students.5. Students may satisfy two or three of these objectives at the same time,but they will not necessarily do so. The objectives cannot therefore be regardedas additive; but neither can they be regarded as overlapping completely. It is accordingly necessary for the Government, in exercising its responsibility forthe broad development of the higher education system, to decide what relativeweight(a) it should give to these objectives for the purpose of assigning priorities and resources; and(b) it should advise others to give them in making the decisions for whichthey are responsible.6. The Government broadly accept the view of the Expenditure Committeethat &quot;postgraduate education should be shaped, not by student demand alone,but principally by the needs of the economy and of society as a whole&quot;. Institu-tional demand, though it must receive due recognition, clearly cannot beregarded as the overriding objective. The Government believe that a systemprimarily designed to satisfy individual demand would be too haphazard a wayof meeting manpower needs. Accordingly, they agree with those who urge thatresources for postgraduate education should be provided primarily in order tomeet the country&apos;s need for trained manpower. This seems to be the mostcomprehensive principle within which it should be possible to go a long way,if not the whole way, towards meeting the other objectives.7. Meeting the country&apos;s need for trained manpower goes somewhat wider than an attempt to match the output of postgraduate students to the demandfor specific skills as reflected in the job market (ie satisfying &quot;manpowerdemand&quot;). Certainly such an attempt should be made by the award-makingbodies but it would only be a starting point. The Government do not under-
estimate the many practical problems which arise here, induding the need toallow for the long interval between the onset of training and the start of a career; the rapid and often dramatic changes in demand which result fromchanging economic and social circumstances; and the mobility in employment which is to be expected of people with postgraduate qualifications. Because ofthese factors, it is unlikely that a close match between supply and demandcould ever be achieved and it will be important to resist the temptation to forecast and plan with spurious precision. A certain looseness of fit is necessarynot only because the knowledge and techniques for bringing about a closematch are lacking, but also to allow for the fact that some of the best post-graduates put their education and training to good use in ways which it isimpossible to predict or relate to any mere extrapolation of the existing jobmarket.Content and Type of Coarse8. The Expenditure Committee proceeded to argue that, judged from the standpoint of the objective just described, the existing pattern of postgraduateeducation left much to be desired. Specifically their recommendations were Rec 3 Pre-experience students should be discouraged from taking non-vocational courses; but encouraged to take vocational taught coursesleading to qualifications which are a pre-requmtefor entry to a career.The number of pre-experience students doing postgraduate research should be considerably reduced.Rec 4 Vocational taught courses and short courses should be orientatedtowards the needs of post-experience students. New ways should besought to enable post-experience Students to do postgraduate research.Rec S More short courses, particularly in applied subjects, should be provided in universities and polytechnics.9. The Government agree that the problems to which the Committee haveaddressed themselves in these recommendations are important, but considerthat too little account has been taken of the moves which have already beenmade and are still being made to shape postgraduate education towards voca-tional ends, or of the complexity of this objective. It would be an over simplifi-cation to regard research training leading to the PhD as no  vocational, ortaught courses as fulfilling the main vocational needs. PhD training is in thenature of an apprenticeship to a future career in scholarship, aimed at careersnot only in university research and teaching, but also in research in the publicservice and in industry. This said, since the mid-sixties and indeed earlier, boththe University Grants Committee (UGC) and the research councils have beenactively encouraging the expansion of postgraduate taught courses relative to research studies (including the introduction of taught course elements in PhDprogrammes); and of collaboration by employers in the specification of content,in contributing to the teaching and in the supervision of courses designed tomeet specific training needs. The following figures speak for themselves:Growth of Full time Postgraduates in Universities in 1966/67-1974/751966-67     1974-75      Percentage increaseResearch training .. 18,409       24,103 31Taught courses     .. 13,564       23,767 75AU postgraduates .. 31,973       47,870 50
The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals in their report have drawn attention to the universities&apos; record in this field, pointing out also the need to strike a balance between introducing new courses quickly in response to anemerging need, and running the risk of unnecessary duplication. On the further education side, while the number of full time postgraduates is much smaller(1,664 in Great Britain in 1966-67 rising to 3,711 in 1974-75), the great majorityof these are following courses with a strongly vocational aim. The polytechnicsand other establishments of further education are well placed through theirclose contacts with industry to develop the courses which employers say they need. A report by the Council for National Academic Awards has drawn attention to the need for these institutions to develop research and postgraduatework of this kind, and the Science Research Council is giving them activeencouragement.10. This is not to say that there is no need to do more. On the researchtraining side the recently published repoit of the SRC on postgraduate trainingshows that the research councils and the members of universities who serve ontheir various boards and committees are conscious of the need to broaden thecourse element in research training, and to make the research experience morerelevant to the subsequent careers of the students. On the taught courses side,further development will call for still closer links between universities andpolytechnics and employers, both at local level and through national bodiessuch as the committee set up jointly by the CVCP, the Committee of directors of Polytechnics and the Confederation of British Industry. A notable recentdevelopment has been the &quot;teaching company&quot; scheme launched by the science research Council in co-operation with the Department of Industry, underwhich postgraduate research and training is undertaken in an industrial settingwith support from selected institutions of higher education.11. The value of post experience training is generally recognised though it isnecessary to weigh the advantages and the disadvantages in different fields. Insome areas of study such as mathematics or non-clinical medical research, theremay be positive disadvantage in a break after the first degree. This said, theGovernment agree that ways and means should be found of attracting a higher proportion of post experience students in appropriate fields. They welcome thedecision of the Science Research Council to allocate an increased number ofstudentships under their INSTANT scheme, which provides for graduates in industry who wish to undertake postgraduate training; and the Councilssuccessful encouragement of postgraduate work involving collaboration with industry (Co-operative Awards in Science and Engineering).12. It should however be noted that in two ways the post-experience studentalready plays a greater part in postgraduate education than is generally recog-nised. In the first place there is an increasing number of part-time postgraduates,in the universities and in further education. In the universities there were in1974/75 over 21,000 part-time students at post-graduate level, compared with about 12,500 in 1966/67. In further education over the same period the numberincreased from 4,600 to nearly 7,600. Secondly, universities and polytechnicsprovide an immense variety of short courses which are particularly attractive to people in employment, not merely for financial reasons but because theyinvolve less interruption of career patterns. Such courses figure hardly at all in
the published statistics and the Government welcome: the attention which theUniversity Grants Committee is now giving to this matter, following therecommendation from the Committee of Vtce-ChaiiceJIors and Principals that more information should be collected.13. In sum, the Government consider that the institutions of higher education and the award-making bodies in this country have, on the record of the last ten years, and in the reports recently published, shown a marked responsivenessto what the Expenditure Committee described as &quot;the needs of the economy and of society as a whole&quot;. These bodies would be the first to agree that morecan and should be done. The Government believes that the content and balanceof postgraduate training, in all its complexity, are best left to the autonomousinteraction of the institutions themselves, the research councils and employers.The Government accepts however that it has a responsibility for regulating the overall scale of the system, for monitoring its broad development, and for ensuring that the financial and administrative arrangements are such as topromote and not hinder the appropriate course of development. This matter is dealt with in the following section.Adntinistratire and Financial Arrangements14. From the evidence which they collected the Expenditure Committeeinferred not only that there was a mismatch between the pattern of postgraduateeducation and the needs of the economy and society, but also that the systemitself was not sufficiently under control. The Committee accordingly proposed a radical re-shaping of the administrative and financial structure, as shown inthe following recommendations :-Rec 6 The VGC in its guidance to universities should introduce quotas toensure that an increasing proportion of postgraduate students arepost-experience.Rec 11 Tuition fees should cease to be charged to UK postgraduate studentsfor courses lasting a year or more. A Working Party should examinethe case for abolishing fees for short courses.Rec 12 Studentships and bursaries should cease to be awarded. All studentson approved postgraduate courses should receive a grant calculated in accordance with a new national formula. Loans to supplement thisgrant should be available. A Working Party should be set up to make proposals for a suitable loan system for postgraduate students.Those on certificate of education courses should continue to receiveundergraduate maintenance grants.Rec IS More effective administrative machinery, mode/led on the university grants Committee system, should be set up in the further educationsector.Rec 16 A Postgraduate Advisory Council should be set up to monitor the implementation of these recommendations and to make regularprogress reports to the Secretary of State for Education and Science;an early task should be to plan a measure of rationalisation ofpostgraduate courses and research.
IS. The Government recognises that these recommendations do not embodya fully worked out plan. The intention, however, seems to be that there shouldbe a move towards a more centralised system of control over student numbers and distribution and expenditure. The Government&apos;s view is that the presentsystem embodies a degree of control which is sufficiently effective in itself,appropriate to the complexity of the situation with which it deals, and com-patible with the autonomy of the institutions in the field; and that it is not necessary to re-structure the system in order to secure any changes in contentor pattern which may be agreed to be desirable.16. The present system, as the Expenditure Committee have pointed out, isdual, in the sense that finance for the provision of training facilities is madeavailable through the UGC, or by the local authorities through the AdvancedFurther Education pool, while student support is provided largely through the research councils (for the natural and social sciences) or by the Department ofEducation and Science and the Scottish Education Department (in the case ofthe arts and humanities). It is not a fair criticism of the degree of controlembodied in this system to point, as the Committee do, to the rapid growth ofpostgraduate numbers in the 1967-72 quinquennium. The target of 220,000-225,000 students on which the 1967-72 recurrent grants settlement and the related capital programme were based did not distinguish between postgraduateand undergraduate students; and universities were encouraged to exceed the target so far as they could because this was at the time considered to be educa-tionally desirable and to make the most economical use of resources. the universities&apos; response to that encouragement in both the postgraduate and theundergraduate sphere, is shown in Table 3 of the Committee&apos;s Report. Thecircumstances in the 1972-77 quinquennium are quite different. The quin-quennial settlement specified separately the number of postgraduate and under-graduate students for which the grants were intended to provide; and the UGCindicated to each university the number of postgraduate students by subject for which provision had been made in the allocation of grants. In their Memo-randum of Guidance the UGC explained their policy as follows: &quot;In particular, the Committee have had to consider whether to allocatetheir grants on the assumption that the reduction in postgraduate numbers in comparison with universities1 estimates will be effected in equal measure in all disciplines and in all universities. They have concluded that some dis-crimination is necessary and that it will be helpful to universities to be in-formed of the varying assumptions that the Committee have made. In general,they have taken the view that while the Governmenfs figures necessitatesome reductions below universities&apos; estimates of growth rates in all disciplinesthese should be smallest in medicine, social studies and business studies andgreatest in physical and biological sciences and in technology. In reachingthis view they have borne in mind the already high level of postgraduatetraining in these disciplines, and on the other hand the vocational demands in social and business studies and in medicine, the projected demand for teachers of the social sciences in all sectors of higher education and the relatively low level at which postgraduate numbers in social studies andmedicine now stand.&quot;The following table shows that, over the 1967-72 quinquennium, when the overall rate of increase was high, postgraduate numbers increased proportion-
ately much more rapidly than undergraduate numbers, whereas in the first three years of the current quinquennium the rate of increase of both under-graduate and postgraduate numbers has been about the same, and much less:Full-time      Increase      Full-time      IncreaseUg students        %       Pg students        %1966-67     ......      152,828 - 31,973 -1971-72     ......       190,593 24-7 44,492 39-21974-75      ......       202,695 6-3 47,870 7-617. On the side of student support, a strict control of expenditure on main-tenance awards for postgraduate study is exercised by the award-making bodies,both in total and in distribution. This control is partial since only a proportionof home postgraduates are dependent on awards from public funds. But theproportion is sufficient (o exercise a considerable leverage on the system asa whole.Sources of Support of Home Postgraduates in GB Universities 1974/75Science and Arts and technology Humanities TotalNo.        %        No.        %       No.        %Government departments (includingriFR OBrt SRm....... 773       5-9      8,448      45 0     9,221      29-0DES and SED)Local government research CouncilsUniversity/CollegeIndustry      ......International and overseasSelf-supportingOther (eg charities) ...232 1 8 1,7747 935 60-8 3,150.....      961 7-4        646474 3-6        121&apos;-*&quot;&quot; ,!:f JR...     1)053 8 1 1,640%	No.450	9,2219-3	1,976168	11,0853-4	1,6070-6	59510	341151	4,3088-7	2,693- -	--1000	31,8266-234-85-01-91-113-58-5100-018. If it were thought desirable to increase the leverage on the numbers anddistribution of postgraduate students, there are a variety of means open to theGovernment within the present system. One is an increase in the level of tuitionfees, which by making students more dependent on awards from public fundssharpens the selective influence of the award-making bodies, whose policiesreflect currently perceived social needs. Such an increase, raising postgraduatefees both absolutely and in relation to undergraduate fees, was proposed in theGovernment^ announcement of 5 July. Another lies in the structure of post-graduate awards, which is also subject to review by the Education departments and the research councils.19. There are two further points to be made on this group of recommenda-tions. The first concerns the Committee^ proposal that part of the support fora postgraduate student should take the form of loans. This is put forwardpartly in order to help contain public expenditure and partly because theywould contribute to a re-ordering of priorities in education expenditure topromote equality of opportunity. It has been urged, against even a partial loansystem, that its unpredictable effects would militate against efforts to match theoutput of postgraduates to manpower requirements, and that the consequences would be potentially damaging in terms of social equity. The Government donot consider that it would be possible to achieve worthwhile public expendituresavings in the near future by a loans scheme which spread the repayments over
a reasonable period. The Government will continue to bear in mind the possi-bility of achieving savings in the longer run through such a change, but theyhave no present intention of introducing a loans scheme in partial or completesubstitution for grants.20. The second point relates to the identification of manpower needs. the science Research Council in their recent report have pointed out the extreme difficulty in obtaining reliable figures, even of a general kind, as a basis for planning. The Government view, as already stated, is that too close a &quot;match&quot;is in any case undesirable, but that there is scope for improvement in thecollection and analysis of information about long-term employment prospects for highly qualified people. Such work is being carried out by the Unit forManpower Studies (UMS) in collaboration with the Manpower Services Corn-mission and the DES.21. The Expenditure Committee considered it anomalous that support forstudents who were taking advanced taught courses, rather than undergoingresearch training, should be the responsibility of the research councils; and indicated in para 125 of their report that if they had not been recommending that the councils should cease to have any responsibility for postgraduatestudent support, they would at least have recommended that responsibility forthe support of non-research students should pass from the councils to the DES.The Government do not share this view.. The Charters of the research councilsspecify amongst the objects for which the councils are established, that ofmaking grants for postgraduate instruction in the relevant fields. There is no clear cut distinction between a &quot;taught course&quot; and &quot;research training&quot;: theformer may include a dissertation and the latter may include some taughtsubjects. The councils have shown themselves to be very much alive, as indicatedin paras 9 and 10 above, to the need to innovate and develop taught courses toserve the needs of industry, commerce and the public services. To transfer thesupport function for these courses elsewhere would merely mean more com-mittees and more bureaucracy.22. The last of the Expenditure Committee&apos;s proposals in this group, thatthere should be a Postgraduate Advisory Council, stems from the recommenda-tion that the system of control and student support be radically changed. if that is not done, there would be no need for a council with the functions des-cribed in the report. Nevertheless the Government acknowledge the need underthe present system for close co-operation between the award-making bodies,the University Grants Committee and the institutions of higher education. Thisis provided for in a variety of ways by cross-representation on the network of committees in the University Grants Committee and the research councils,through the participation of university and polytechnic staff on the committees of the research councils, by official contacts at all levels, and especially throughthe Committee on Postgraduate Support of the Advisory Board for the research councils (ABRQ. The latter committee was set up soon after the ABRC itself was established, to bring together the data relevant to the support of post-graduate students and to provide a forum for the exchange of views among thevarious bodies concerned. The Government agree that the question of the needfor some form of broadly based advisory machinery, to provide strategic adviceover the whole field of postgraduate education, needs examination, and is
pursuing this matter with the University Grants Committee and the advisory board for the Research Councils.23. Finally, with regard to Recommendation 13, the Governmenfs reply(Cmnd. 5368, July 1973) to the Committee&apos;s Report on Further and higher education (HC 48-1,1972-73) pointed out the problems involved in establishingcentral machinery to administer and  nance the whole higher education sector.Problems arise similarly with any scheme to set up machinery for the further education sector (with more than 500 colleges, providing a great variety of courses at all levels); there is great advantage in the close identification ofcolleges with their local communities, permitting flexible and fruitful contact with local industry and other important interests. These are complex matters which will need further consideration in the light of developments on theLayfield Report and devolution. The specific question of improving the co-ordination of higher education in the public sector is to be examined urgently,following recent consultations with the Council for Local Education Authoritiesand other bodies concerned, by a working group under the Chairmanship of theMinister of State with responsibility for higher education, Department ofEducation and Science.
ANNEXMiscellaneous Recommendations of the Expenditure CommitteeRec 1Study should be made to enable postgraduate education to be costed separately from undergraduate education. The costs of different types of postgraduate course in different disciplines should also be separately calculated.Studies of various kinds to apportion expenditure between undergraduatework, postgraduate work, research and other activities have been under-taken by the DES, the UGC and others. The central difficulty is thatuniversities are engaged in a number of inter-rclated activities such asteaching undergraduates and postgraduates, research, advice and con-sultancy to government and industry. Teaching, administrative and other staff, equipment and buildings contribute jointly to these activities, makingapportionment of costs extremely difficult. The Governments conclusion is that to produce separate costs for postgraduates would entail makingarbitrary assumptions about the apportionment of costs and that theresults would be unreliable.Rec 2Statistics of postgraduate education collected by the UGC and DES should be improved in depth and published sooner. In particular more information shouldbe provided about postgraduates in the further education sector, those studyingpart time and those on short courses.The DES has been developing new statistical systems based on individualstudent records over the past few years. The University Statistical Recordis now fully operational, and a similar system is under development forfurther education establishments. These systems will produce statistics ofthe kind suggested in the Report earlier than was possible in the past.Problems of definition concerning post-experience students are being studied. The Government accept that the possibility of obtaining informa-tion on numbers of students on short courses should be explored, and thisis being done.ReelUniversities&apos; appointments officers should, ex ojficio, be members of the inter-viewing boards for postgraduate candidates.This is a matter for individual universities.RecBThe appointment of industrial liaison officers at universities and polytechnicsshould be supported from public funds.The main objective of the Industrial Liaison Scheme was to assist thesmaller manufacturing firm to improve its efficiency and technologicalstrength. In carrying out this work the officers would use the educationalinstitution where they were based as one of the many sources of helpavailable to small businesses. At no time was it intended that the service would be a major source of postgraduate projects. The Department ofTrade and Industry (now Department of Industry) withdrew financial
support from the scheme on the advice of the Committee of Inquiry onSmall Firms (the Bolton Committee) which had concluded that a differenttype of information service was needed for small firms covering both theservice and manufacturing sectors. It was thought likely that many of the universities and colleges would continue to finance their centres as a meansof keeping in touch with local industry, and in the event more than 30have done this. The Small Firms Information Centres that were established on the recommendation of the Bolton Committee have always referredenquirers to educational institutions where appropriate; and as a result ofthe differing role of these centres universities and colleges are now put intouch with a much wider range of small businesses than was possible underthe previous more limited arrangement.Rec 9The research councils should continue to provide research training support$rants to selected university and polytechnic departments and to award researchfellowships to students of exceptional promise.There are no plans for altering the existing arrangements for ResearchTraining Support Grants for selected university and polytechnic depart-ments. The current rate per student is  300.Rec 10More members of the academic staff of polytechnics should be appointed to the research councils and to their committees and boards.As a general rule members of the research councils and their boards and committees are appointed because of their personal ability and suitability,and not to represent particular organisations or interests. As polytechnicsdevelop their expeitise in subjects for which research councils are respon-sible, the appointment of members of their staffs to the councils and theirboards and committees can naturally be expected to increase; the science research Council has 18 polytechnic members on its boards and com-mittees; the SSRC has 11.Rec 14Senior civil servants and senior staff from industry and commerce should, asfar as possible, be trained together in management studies.The Government agree with this recommendation and are alreadyimplementing it in a variety of ways.Printed ta EnjUnd lor Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office by McCorquodale Primers, Ltd., London.HM 7752 Dd. 1M74J KM t(K
