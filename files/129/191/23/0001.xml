HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(76) 73 COPY NO       g Q6 September 1976CABINETHEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK ETC. ACT 1974SAFETY REPRESENTATIVES AND SAFETY COMMITTEESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for employment t sought the agre ement of the Ministerial Committee on economic policy (El) to my making Regulations and approving a Code of practice which would give the right to recognised trade unions to appoint safetyrepresentatives and place an obligation on employers to set up safetycommittees in certain circumstances.    These measures stem fromproposals put to me by the Health and Safety Commission.2.        These proposals were criticised by El, mainly on the grounds thatthey would create a new claim on resources at a time when the Governmentis seeking to restrain expenditure in the public sector; and that thedifficulties would be particularly severe in relation to local authorities.I well understand my colleagues&apos; reluctance to accept proposals whichwould increase expenditure in areas for which they are responsible.    Inpresent arcumstances I would expect a similar reaction to any such proposal.   But I am sure it will be agreed that in every case that comesbefore us we have to balance the need to keep expenditure down against the adverse effects on our policies that may result.    In this case I am convinced that the delay that has already occurred in implementing theseproposals is having a serious effect on our relations with the Trades UnionCongress (TUC); and that any failure on our part to comply with what is accepted as an undertaking within the Social Contract will be seized upon by elements within the trade union movement as a means of causing usembarrassment.    It seems to me that the consequent effect on our policiescould well be out of all proportion to the amount of money involved.3.        It was argued in El that it would be wrong to implement these measures until an attempt had been made to arrive at agreed and accurateestimates of the costs involved; and I was asked to arrange this.    Suchan attempt has in fact already been made, as my colleagues know, and itwas only because agreement could not be reached that I was forced to refer to a range of estimates in my submission.   I have tried to make it clear1
that, sjfjicra the cost of these measures depends upon the number ofrepresentatives who wiU in due course be appointed and the number of committees which will be set up, and since these numbers will depend on negotiations between employers and workers representatives which may wellgo on for some time, it is virtually impossible to arrive at an accurate      .estimate of costs now.    It must depend on how successful such negotiations are in creating a sensible pattern of representatives and committees in awhole variety of different circumstances.    My colleagues appear to beassuming that these negotiations will be unsuccessful.    The Health and SafetyCommission, which has been discussing its proposals with the confederation of British Industry (CBJjand TUC for many months, is much more optimistic,particularly since no account has been taken in the estimates of the fact that public sector employers, who are generally good employers, will already have been allowing time for discussions of health and safety matters through their normal consultative arrangements.    It is also true that a high proportionof workplaces in the public sector are low-risk and will involve the minimum of attention from safety representatives and committees.    I myself believethat we ought to accept the Health and Safety Commission^ judgment.4.        However, since we are unlikely to resolve this radical divergence ofview, and attempts to do so will only add to the delay in implementation, Istrongly recommend that we should agree on a compromise solution.    It isimportant to remember that in 1977-78 the number of representatives and committees created will grow only gradually and that the consequent costs are likely to be considerably less than they would be in a full year when thesituation has stabilised.    The costs in 1977-78 would therefore be uncertaineven if the figures for later years were agreed.    In the Civil Service and the health Service I think it is reasonable to expect that such extra costs as maybe incurred in these initial stages could be absorbed.    As far as the localauthorities are concerned, in the light of the range of costs which haveemerged, I think it would be sufficient to set aside  10 million for expenditurein 1977-78 (which would of course include expenditure in educationalestablishments) and I propose that we should agree this now.    During 1977-78we should be able to assess more accurately, in the light of the progressthat is being made, what the costs are likely to be in future years.A BDepartment of Employment6 September 1976
