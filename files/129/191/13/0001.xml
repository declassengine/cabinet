*HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 6327 July 1976CABINETDEVOLUTION TO SCOTLAND AND WALES:SUPPLEMENTARY STATEMENTNote by the Lord President of the council. My 25 May statement on devolution promised a further statement onoutstanding matters before the Summer Recess.2,       The matters to be covered are too numerous and assorted to be covered in an oral statement of acceptable length and character.   The bestvehicle for them will be a short White Paper updating Cmnd 6348.   It wouldprobably be convenient to those who follow devolution if this included the parts of my 25 May statement that modified the content of the devolutionschemes.3.        I attach at Annex the draft of a statement,    The decision It reflectsand the terms in which they are expressed have been agreed by the ministerial Committee on Devolution Strategy.    I envisage that publication would take place on Tuesday 3 August, and that mere should be brief oralstatements in both Houses the same day.4.

(confidential) EVOLUTION TO SCOTLAND AM) WALES :SUPPLEMENTARY STATEMENTANNEX TO0(76)61DRAFTPART I: introduction.    Last November the Government published the White Paper &quot;Our ChangingDemocracy&quot; (cmnd 6348).    This set out the Government*r comprehensiveproposals for devolution to Scotland and. Wales, and invited public discussion on them.    A few matters were specifically left open for later decision inthe light of comments,2,     There has since been much delate in Parliament and throughout theUnited Kingdom, with extensive comments and suggestions offered by interested bodies and by the general public.     The Government have encouraged andvalued this process and have carefully considered the views submitted.3.    The general debate has strengthened the Government&apos;s conviotion thattheir basic approach is the right one for Britain.    That approachemphasises stronger democratic control of public business, and scope for thepeople of Scotland and Wales to run their own domestic affairs within thesecure and essential framework of political and economic unity under theUnited Kingdom Parliament in which all are represented.4.     In the light of the comments, the Government have decided upon a numberof improvements in the proposals, and have reached conclusions on matterspreviously left open.    The present statement explains the main new features,including for convenience these already announced in the Governments state-ment of 25 May to Parliament.     These features, together with those unchangedtton Cant 6348, are being incorporated in the devolution Bill, the drafting of which is now well advanced.     It will be introduced in Parliament at thebeginning cf the forthcoming Parliamentary session.(confidential)
5*     &quot;&apos;he new features arc set out in the order in which related subjectsappeared in the rTavowoor vfhite Paper, and cross-references are given.aPART II: SCOTLANDScottish Assembly Seats6.     P^rapraphs 3?-33 of Croud 63^3 er^-i^a^d thr.t at the first electionseach Porlianentary constituency wuld return two Assembly members;    andthat at later elections the Parliamentary constituencies would be dividedas necessary to form one, two or three Assembly constituencies, depending on the size of the Parliamentary electorate.7.     ftis syittn cf division would give low representation to several wide-sprcau rural or island constituencies, and in the light of the viewsreceived the Government have decided to change it.     Every Parliamentaryconstituency will now have at least two Assembly seats, and those withelectorates more than a quarter above the average for Scotland will havethroe seats.     On present electorates this will produce an Assembly ofabout 1^0 instead of 138.B.     The application of these revised arrangements will start with the firsteHctior-n;   it will not be relayed until the Boundary Commission for scotland has had -lii.-,o to divide the Parliamentary constituencies into separateAsneiably ones.The Scottish Sxeculiye9-     Anpointnant.     Paragraphs 44-45 of Cnnd 6348 envisaged that theSecretary cf State would invite a prospective Chief Executive to form an executive, and cftcr Assembly approval would formally appoint him and hisial)
coll&amp;a^aeR.     The Government have now decided that it should be entirelyfor the Ass.-iuibl.y to decue who ia to be the Chief Executive.     TheSecretary of Stcts will have merely the role of formally appointing- theChief iua-cuiive when approved by the Assembly, and other Executive Ifemberson the adviae of the Chief  Jxemrfcivg.The Chief Executive will appointAssistants.10.   Ifen-bers and Assistants.     Paragraph 46 of Cmnd 6348 envisaged that itshould be possible for Executive Members and Assistants to be appointedfrom outside the Assembly.     The Government have now decided that this possibility should be restricted to posts corresponding to those of lawofficer3 at Westminster,11.   If umbers and Pay.    Paragraph 48 of Cmnd 6346&quot; envisaged that theSecretary of State should determine the pay and allowances of ExecutiveMembers and Assistants to begin with;   and that the laaximum number of themallowed should be laid down in the devolution Act, with the Secretary ofState having power to make changes later.     The Government have now decidedthat all these matters should be left entirely to the Assembly.Scottish Assembly Legislation12.   Consideration of Vires, of Assembly Bills.     Paragraphs 57-59 of cmnd 63^8 envisaged that the Secretary of State should be able to reject jan Assembly Bill which ho judged, on the advice of tha Law Officers, to bo I&apos;ultra vires - that is, going beyond the Assembly&apos;s legal powers.     TheGoveru-iuryt have decided that the Secretary of State should not after all beable to do this.     If there is doubt about the legality of an Assembly Bill, &apos;the final decision will lie with the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.        ;3
y-----......v13,    UnitftH K-;.nylp&quot;&apos; Policy Objection to Assembly Bills.   Paragraphs alsoenvisaged that: the Government should have unqualified general reserve powers,subject to affirmative resolution of Parliament, to reject Assembly Bills on grounds of policy.   The Government have now decided that these general reserve powers should be available only if an Assembly Bill is considered by the Governmentto have unacceptable repercussions on matters /or which they remain responsible.They will continue to be controlled directly by Parliament.   In addition, the 1Government have decided to drop the proposal in paragraph 58 that the Secretary of    ^State should be able on his own initiative to send a Bill back to the Assembly forreconsideration.14.   Judicial Review.   Paragraphs 62-65 of Cmnd 6348 explained the complex problemof whether, after an Assembly measure has received Assent by Her Majesty inCouncil and thus become an Act, the courts should be able to consider, at the instanceof any litigant, whether it is within the devolved powers.   The Government haveweighed very carefully the views expressed and have decided that there should be aright of access to the courts in this respect.United Kingdom Reserve Powers in Executive Matters15,   Paragraphs 71-7 3 of Cmnd 6348 envisaged a range of general reserve powers        ewhich the Government could exercise, with Parliament&apos;s approval, in relation toexecutive actions of the Scottish administration.   The Government have decided on two major changes in these powers.   Firstly, there will not be a power, as paragraph^73c had envisaged, for the Government to take back devolved functions.   Secondly, theremaining powers to give directions or to annul subordinate instruments (paragraphs73a and b) will be available only if their exercise is considered by the Governmentnecessary to prevent unacceptable repercussions on matters for which they remain responsible. AL.(confidential)
Taxation(confidential )16,   Devolved aervices vill be financed by the block fund voted by Parliament, afterconsultation wi;!- the Scottish administration, and drawn from the national pool of taxes.   This is the fairest way of sharing resources, based as it is on local needs.Paragraph 108 of Cnmd 634S proposed that in addition the Scottish administration should be able to levy an optional surcharge on the rates to supplement the blockfund.   Thorough re-examination has confirmed that no better method of devolving SOmrevenue-raising power is available within the current framework of national and local taxation, but in the light of the comments received the Government have decided notto pursue this proposal.   If future changes are made in the taxation framework,particularly for financing local government, that would make it feasible for theScottish administration to supplement the block fund while still meeting the conditions set out in paragidph 108 of Cmnd 6348 the Government will be ready to considerincorporating the necessary revenue-raising powers in subsequent legislation.Univer sitie s17.   There has been wide comment on future responsibility for the universities in-Scotland.   Opinion is sharply divided;  but no factors have emerged which theGovernment did not take into account in reaching the conclusion an paragraph 127 of cmnd 6348 that responsibility should not be devolved.   The Government have therefore decided, on a careful balance of the considerations, to confirm this conclusion.   the universities in Scotland benefit from being part of the wider United Kingdom system,and the total and balance of university provision in this system must remain of concerrto the Government in the interests of the United Kingdom as a whole.   There is general agreement that the University Grants Committee, which operates throughoutGr^at Britain, has worked well as a means of giving state support to the universitieswhilst permitting substantial autonomy and academic freedom.5(confidential)
( c.t. hi FIH &apos;f hi Tl AI )18.   The Government recognise that the Scottish administration, vith its wideresponsibilities in education, will Lave a clos^ interest in the work of the universities.   The University Grants Committee fully shares this recognition.Accordingly, the Government will take account of the views of the scottish administration in making appointments to the Committee.   They, will revise theCommittees terms of reference to underline the continuing need to take thoroughaccount of the distinctive Scottish education system outside the university sector,as well as of the distinctive features of the Scottish universities themselves.   TheCommittee itself will invite advisers from the Scottish administration to sit with it at all levels of business, and it recognises that adjustments will be needed inits supporting structure.   It will at all times be ready to provide information,advice and evidence to the Scottish administration.19.   The Government also recognise the importance, both for their own planning and for that of the Scottish administration, of viewing post-school education as awhole.   The Government therefore intend to propose to the Scottish administration,when it is in being, the setting up of a council for higher education in Scotland, withrepresentatives of all the institutions concerned, to be a forum for the discussionof problems affecting the future development of all parts of the post-school system,including relationships with the schools.CONFIDENTIAL
(confidential)2-0.   The Government have decided that responsibility for the operation of&quot; theScottish Development Agency and for all appointments to it should not be divided,as paragraph 138 of Cmnd 6348 envisaged, but should be transferred to the scottish administration.   This includes responsibility for financing the Agency from theresources controlled by the Scottish administration.   As the Government1 s amiounce-rnent on 25 May stated, the industrial investment operations of the Agency will besubject to guidelines laid down by the Government from time to time, in addition tothe guidelines already envisaged dealing with the terms of disposal of factories.With these qualifications, the Agency will be wholly the responsibility of the scottish administration.   The Agency will also retain its existing powers to act under thedirection of the Secretary of State in selective industrial assistance cases underSection 7 o  the Industry Act, 1972.Scots Private Law21.   Paragraph 145 of Cmnd 5348 recognised the need to foster the coherentdevelopment of Scotland&apos;s distinctive system of private law.   The Government havenow decided that the Assembly should have legislative powers in the whole of this field.22.  It is important that the use of these powers should not damage the consistentUnited Kingdom framework of law that is essential to continued unity in matters liketrade, consumer protection and industrial relations.   In these matters United Kingdonrresponsibilities will clearly continue and must be safeguarded.   To ensure this.Parliament&apos;s general reserve powers, on the lines explained in paragraph 13 above,will be available in relation to Assembly legislation on private law.   The Governmentwill prefer however to rely essentially on cloaOjtimely and systematicconsultation with the Scottish administration, both when Assemblylegislation  on Scots  private  law stands  to   affect  United
Kingdom matters anJ when Westminster legislation or other Government work(including European Community business) has to enter the field of Scot3 privatelaw or otherwise to affect it.The Scottish Courts23.   The question of responsibility for the Scottish courts and their administra-tion was left open in paragraphs 149-151 of Cand 6348, except that the appointment and conditions of tenure of the supreme court judges and matters concerned withappeal to the House of Lords were in any event not to he devolved.   The GovernmenthavD considered carefully the many and diverse views which have since been expressed.   The main factors remain those summarised in paragraph 150.24.   The Government have concluded that it is possible to make a sound divisionof responsibility which will recognise, on the one hand, the need for Parliamentto retain responsibility for those aspects which ensure the existence and independ-ence of the courts as institutions for administering non-devolved as well asdevolved law; and on the other hand the need for the Scottish Assembly to havean appropriate role in relation to this distinctive part of the Scottish legalheritage.25.   The Government have therefore decided that the administration of thecourts should he fully devolved, together with responsibility for the law ofevidence, diligence and contempt of court and for the district courts, includingthe appointment of stipendiary magistrates and justices of the peace.   Theappointment and conditions of tenure of supreme court judges and sheriffs willnot be devolved.   Parliament will keep sole responsibility for legislating onthe basic structure of the court system (other than the district courts)together with the powers of the two supreme courts to regulate procedure inall the courts, and also such aspects of jurisdiction as are essential tosafeguard the structure.   Other aspects of jurisdiction will be devolved.8(confidential)
26.   Ac paragraph 152 of Cmnd 6348 explained, the British Tourist authority will continue tc be financed by the Government, though the Scottish administration will be free to give extra funds of its own to the British Tourist Authority orother agencies.   J-n the face of international competition, there are clearadvantages in a combined marketing programme overseas for the United Kingdom&apos;stourism trade.   However, the Government recognise that the Scottish administration will have a close interest in the Authority&apos;s execution of its role on behalf ofScotland.   Accordingly, the Government have decided to provide for a strongerScottish voice in the management and development of the Authority&apos;s work.27.  The Authority will be headed by a smaller Board of only five members, including one member from the Scottish Tourist Board who will be appointed by the scottish administration.   The representative from Scotland, together with the representatives from the other two National Tourist Boards, will carry a decisive influence in theBoard&apos;s deliberations.   Further, the Authority will be specially directed toprepare its annual programmes to reflect the relative marketing requirements ofScotland as well as of England and Wales.   For that purpose it will be required toapportion its financial resources, and thereafter to draw up its annual programmes,in consultation with the Scottish Tourist Board and the other National Tourist Boards.Nominated Bodies28,   Cmnd 6348 made no special proposals for the future of the housing corporation, which provides finance for housing associations throughout GreatBritain.   The Government have now decided that for its activities inScotland the Corporation will be financed by and accountable to the scottish administration, and the administration will share in making appointments to it.(confidential)
I        ill 1^t-a m i       yRe^ul-g-tion of -the; Profcr.r,i nns29.   Paragraphs 162-163 of Grand 6348 specially invited coinnents on how fartho Scottish Assembly should have power to legislate about the regulation ofthe professions.   The Government emphasise that this has nothing to do withwhether or not there should ba political intervention in these matters; thequestion is solely whether or not to devolve to the Assembly the power which parliament now has to legislate if it chooses.   After weighing the viewssubmitted, the Government have decided that legislative power should hedevolved in respect of the professions which operate essentially on a scottish basis - that is, &quot;the distinctively Scottish teaching professionand the two branches (advocates and solicitors) of the Scottish legal profession.   Legislative power in respect of other professions will remain with Parliament.10confidential
r(confidential)PART III: I-MLBSWelah Assembly Seats30.   Paragraph 177 of Cmnd 6348 envisaged that at the first elections eachParliamentary constituency would return two Assembly members;   and thatat later elections the Parliamentary constituencies would be divided as necessary to form one, two or three Assembly constituencies, depending onthe size of the Parliamentary electorate.31-   This system of division would give low representation to several wide-spread rural constituencies, and in the light of the views received theGovernment have decided to change it.     Every Parliamentary constituencywill now havo at least two Assembly seats, and those with electorates morethan a quarter above the average for Wales will have three seats.    on present electorates this will produce an Assembly of about 80 instead of 75.32.   The application of these revised arrangements will start with the firstelections;   it will not be delayed until the Boundary Commission for Haleshas had time to divide the Parliamentary constituencies into separateAssembly one3.United Kindlon Reserve Powers in Executive Hatters33.   Paragraph 208 of Cmnd 6348 envisaged a range of general reserve powers which the Government could exercise, with Parliament*e   approval, inrelation to actions of the Welsh Assembly.    The Government have decided ontvro major changes in these powers.    Firstly, there will not be a power, asparagraph 203c had envisaged, for the Government to take back devolved11?-&apos;i
Cri^MFinss kits a Is)-functions.   Secondly, the: remaining powers to give directions or to annulsubordinate instruments (paragraph 208a and b) will be available only if their exercise is considered by the Government necessary to prevent unacceptablerepercussions on matters for which they remain responsible.Taxation34.  Devolved services will be financed by the block fund voted by Parliament,after consultation with the Welsh Assembly, and drawn from the national pool of taxes.   This is the fairest way of sharing resources, based as it is on local needs.   Paragraph 229 of Cmnd 6348 proposed that in addition the assembly should be able to levy an optional surcharge on the rates to supplement the block fund.   Thorough re-examination has confirmed that no better method ofdevolving some revenue-raising power is available within the current framework of national and local taxation, but in the light of the comments received theGovernment have decided not to pursue this proposal.   If future changes aremade in the taxation framework,particularly for financing local government, thatwould make it feasible for the Welsh Assembly to supplement the blockbudget while still meeting the conditions set out in paragraph 108 of Cmnd 6348,the Government will be ready to consider incorporating the necessary revenue-raising powers in subsequent legislation.12faconfidential
^confidential)Local Government in Wales35.  As paragraphs 236-237 of Cmnd 6343 explained, the devolution Act will not affect the structure of local government in Wales, and the tasks of localgovernment will remain materially unchanged.   The key difference, on devolution,will be that where central government now has supervisory responsibilitiesrelating to local government, those responsibilities will mostly pass to the welsh assembly.   Parliament will remain responsible, for primary legislation in this asin other respects, but paragraph 198 of Cmnd 6348 recognised that the assembly should have wide freedom to comment on or make proposals for legislationaffecting Wales in devolved matters.   The Assembly will have power to do thisUnder the devolution Act.   In the light of this, the Government will ask theAssembly to consider and report, after appropriate consultations, on futureiocal government structure in Wales in the context of the Assembly&apos;s own newresponsibilities for the whole of Wales. tjlniversitiesH.  For reasons similar to those explained in paragraph 17 above, the government we decided, in accordance with paragraph 243 of Cmnd 6348, that responsibilityfor the University of Wales should not be devolved.37.  The Government recognise that the Welsh Assembly, with its wide responsibilities in education, will have a close interest in the work of the University.   TheUniversity Grants Committee fully shares this recognition.   Accordingly, theGovernment will take account of the views of the Assembly in making appointmentsCo the Committee.   They will revise the Committee^ terms of reference to :^derline the continuing need to take thorough account of the Welsh education system !outside the university sector.   The Committee itself will invite advisers from the(confidential)
fcONFlPENTJAQWelsh administration to sit with it at all levels of business, and it recognises that adjustments will be needed in its supporting structure.It will at all times be ready to provide information, advice and evidence to the Assembly.38,  The Government also recognise the importance, both for their ownplanning and for that of the Welsh Assembly, of viewing post-school educationas a whole.   The Government therefore intend to propose to the assembly the setting up of a council, with representatives of all the institutionsconcerned, to be a forum for the discussion of problems affecting the futured development of all parts of the post-school system in Wales, includingrelationships with the schools.Welsh Development Agency39,  The Government have decided that responsibility for the Welsh DevelopmentAgency should not be divided, as paragraph 251 of Cmnd 6348 envisaged, but should be transferred to the Welsh Assembly on the same basis as thatsummarised in paragraph 20 above.Tourism40.  As paragraph 152 of Cmnd 6348 explained, the British Tourist authority will continue to be financed by the Government, though the Welsh Assembly willbe free to give extra funds of its own to the British Tourist Authority or otheragencies.   In the face of international competition, there are clear advantages ina combined marketing programme overseas for the United KingdonVts tourismtrade.   However, the Government recognise that the Welsh Assembly will havea close interest in the Authority&apos;s execution of its role on behalf of Wales.14confidential
Accordingly, the Government have decided to provide for 3 stronger Welshvoice in the management and development uf the Authority&apos;s work,41.   The Authority will be headed by a smaller Board of only five members,including one member from the Wales Tourist Board, who will be appointedby the Assembly.   The representative from Wales, together with therepresentatives from the other two National Tourist Boards, will carry a decisive influence in the Board&apos;s deliberations.   Further, the Authority willbe specially directed to prepare its annual programmes to reflect therelative marketing requirements of Wales as well as of England and Scotland.For that purpose it will be required to apportion its financial resources, and thereafter to draw up its annual programmes, in consultation with the WalesTourist Board and the other National Tourist Boards.Nominated Bodies42,  Stronger local democratic accountability of non-elected bodies is a keyfeature of the Government1 s approach to devolution in Wales.   They havedecided to strengthen the role of the Welsh Assembly in this field.   The assembly will therefore be given a new power to take over the functions of statutorynominated bodies operating exclusively in Wales in devolved matters.   TheAssembly will be able to assume such functions by Order, subject to approval        ;by the Secretary of State for Wales, whereas paragraph 262 of the November )White Paper proposed leaving the initiative with the Secretary of State.   The jjinitiative will now lie with the Assembly, and the new arrangement will provide      jj!(a flexible system for transferring the functions of individual bodies to the Welsh iAssembly if the Assembly concluded that such a transfer was desirable.   New15
(CO i^FIDENTIAl)-i   H ii   ***** *        &quot;financial arrangements would be needed if the Assembly wanted to take overa body with long-term borrowing powers, since the Assembly itself will not ;possess such powers.   In addition, it would be inappropriate for the take-overpower to apply to tribunals.43.   The Welsh Committee of the Countryside Commission will be wound up andthe devolution Act will provide for the establishment of a new statutoryWelsh Countryside Commission, financed and appointed by and accountable tothe Welsh Assembly.44.  For its activities in Wales the Housing Corporation, which providesfinance for housing associations, will be financed by and accountable to theAssembly, and the Assembly will share in making appointments to it.PART IV :   THE WAY AHEAD45.  The devolution Bill to be introduced at the beginning of the next parliamentary session will reflect all the decisions set out above, and any new features whichmay result from the Governments continuing work and consultations.   Aspromised in Cmnd 6348, the Government will also publish a consultationdocument on England.46.  The Government are convinced that the schemes of devolution for Scotlandand Wales, fulfilling the clear undertakings they gave in the programme on whichthey were elected, represent a big step forward in democratic government.Major economic problems must remain principally a matter for combined andcoordinated effort by all the people of the United Kingdom.   But the schemes willmeet the evident desire of the Scottish and Welsh people, within the UnitedKingdom, to run a wide range of their own domestic affairs in accordance with16(confidential)
their distinctive outlook and traditions.47.  All this will modernise and strengthen the United Kingdom.   TheGovernment believe that their plans deserve the support of all those whoare determined to maintain the United Kingdom yet at the same time valuethe vigour and richness of national diversity within it.
