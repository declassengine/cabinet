*HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 62 COPY NO g J27 July 1976CABINETUNEMPLOYMENT AMONG THE YOUNGNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer attach a memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury.D W treasury Chambers27 July 1976
CONFTDEVTTALYOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE proposed EARLY RETIREMENT (&quot;JOB SWAP&quot;) scheme memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the treasury the Paymaster General reports in CP(76)5$ the outcome of the -discussion in GEN 27 on the proposals for a package of measures to relieve unemployment among young people..   The one item, on which wehave not been able to agree is the so-called &quot;Job Swap&quot; scheme,2.      I agree that the Government should introduce a package of measuresX agree that the package with only the three agreed measures (workexperience scheme, training places and recruitment subsidy for under20&apos; a unemployed for 6 months) seems inadequate! but I do not agreethat the &quot;Job swap&quot; scheme would be a relevant or cost-effectivemeasure in such a package.CoatJJ..     The estimated public expenditure cost of -the job -swap *Ck*am* is lid million grope.    Of this,  88 million would fall on the contingency reserve in .1977-78.    The estimate a**uh*s only 4oX of those eligiblewould opt into the scheme but as many as &amp;Ofi could do so, in which case all the figures would be doubled.k.     This gross expenditure) like other expenditure from the contingency reserve, is partly offset in its effects on the public sector borrowing requirement, by tax flowbacks mad lower social security benefits.Offsets of this kind have been allowed for in the PSBR forecast for1977-78.    The offsets, in this partioulisr cess could be nuofa lower, itf&quot;,is generally accepted, the condition that that person vacating ajob is replaced by someone frost the unemployment register-, is notenforceable.    Indeed &quot;Job Swap&quot; is something of a misnomer in view, ofthis.5-     The scheme will undoubtedly add to the pressures to reduce the qualifying age for a state retirement pen a ion.    This could cost sosta 1800 million if, as many seek, it were reduced to 60 for men.   there
is already strong pressure for this,  and as the scheme will require   \legislation the Government will be vulnerable to amendments in committee to make the scheme permanent.Relevance to package j&quot;6.      The scheme does nothing for young people, and unbalances apackage aimed at them.    It merely &quot;buys&quot; people off the unemploymentregister,  and in so far as the replacement condition is unenforceable)it does not even do that.    Employers may well continue to hire and firethe same numbers as they otherwise would have done and there will be nomeans of checking on this.    The number of job changes in a month is ofthe order of 800,000:  the number of job changes within the over 64age bracket in a month is 25i000*    It is not unreasonable to say thatthe scheme may well have no effect at all on the unemployment figures.An alternative7.      I recognise the need to prepare a package which will seem anadequate reeponee to the problem of youth unemployment.    But we need to have regard to the damaging effects of announcing, within a fewdays of the public expenditure cuts, a package which is so large andwhich contains such a dubious item as the &quot;job swap&quot; scheme.    the agreed items come to  24 million.    I suggest that a package would bemore convincing if in total it amounted to no more than  50 million or so and if it included some -extra money (say another  15 million)for the job creation scheme,  to help it support all acceptableprojects during the winter, and a further margin of (say)  10 million for the work experience scheme.    We could announce that this extra 25 million would be placed at the disposal of the Manpower services commission,.to use in the proportions they found necessary, for the job Creation Programme and the Work Experience Scheme.    I understandthat the Manpower Services Commission, at official level, haveintimated that this would be acceptable to them, and that they are confident that they could allocate another  15 million to projectsunder the c.p. between now and trve end&apos; of this calendar year.JBTreasury ChambersSW127 July 1976&apos; CONFIDENTIAL- -    4*.
