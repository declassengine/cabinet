THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 58 COPY NO    g J.26 July 1976CABINETUNEMPLOYMENT AMONG YOUNG PEOPLEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Prices and consumer protection and Paymaster general. At its meeting on 15 July the Cabinet &quot;invited the Ministerial group on unemployment among young people to consider further the possibilityof announcing before the Summer Recess the introduction of a workexperience scheme and a job swap scheme; and to report back11(CM(76) 15th Conclusions, Minute 4).WORK EXPERIENCE SCHEME2,        The Group agreed that Government support for a work experiencescheme should be announced before the Recess,    Certain problems remain to be resolved, notably on the tax treatment of the proposed  16 per weekallowance.   These problems are not, however, such as to stand in the wayof an immediate announcement that a scheme will be introduced.    Thescheme will start in September, will provide places for up to 30, 000 young people in the 16-IS age group on courses of 6-12 months duration at a grosscost of  19 million including staff costs, but a net cost of some  10 millionsince most of those receiving allowances would otherwise be receivingsupplementary or other benefits.   While applications for the scheme willhave to be received in the first instance by the end of March 1977 the need to extend the scheme to allow later application will be kept under review,JOB SWAP SCHEME3.        There was agreement among the Group that a job swap scheme,which would provide an allowance until normal retirement age to men aged 64 and women aged 59 who retired and were replaced by the recruitment by their employer of somebody from the unemployment register,was in principle desirable.   The scheme proposed by the Secretary of Statefor Employment w^uld come into effect at the end of the year and run for months,   It is estimated to bring about the early retirement of 116, 000people, and to reduce the number of registered unemployed by 92, 000 at its
maximum effect.    The gross cost is put at  118 million and the net cost 42 million of which  10 million in 1976-77*  29 million in 1977-76 and 3 million in 1978-79.    Legislation would be required in the 1976-77 Session,Jh discussion the Group agreed that the proposal should be amended in onerespect - by excluding from eligibility people who were already unemployed,and to whom the replacement condition could therefore not apply; theestimates above do sot allow for tills change.4.        The Group however also agreed that there are a number of serious problems about the scheme.    These include an inevitably wide uncertainty about the cost, the difficulty of enforcing or even policing the replacementcondition and the danger that it would add to other existing pressures forearlier retirement.    Such a scheme would also not be directed specificallytowards unemployment among young people.5.        Some members of the Group considered that despite these problems the Government should announce before the Recess a commitment tointroduce a scheme of this sort, since without it the package of employmentmeasures would not be appropriate to the magnitude of the presentunemployment problem.   Other members considered that since the scheme could not be introduced until the end of the year farther work should be doneon the problems before any commitment was entered into, and the chief secretary reserved his position.   Since the meeting of the Group the chief secretary and the Secretary of State for Employment have explored further the possibility of a reference in a package to a job swap scheme which would fall short of a commitment in principle but were unable to agree on an approach of this sort.conclusions.       i.        The Group recommend that the statement which theChancellor told the House on 22 July would be made before the Recessshould announce the amended unemployed young persons recruitmentsubsidy and the expansion of training places for young people agreed by the Cabinet at its meeting on 15 July and also the work experiencescheme outlined in paragraph 2 above.ii.       The Group also agreed that a job swap scheme would inprinciple be desirable.   They were unable to agree whether, in thelight of the difficulties involved, the statement should include a commitment in principle to a scheme based on the proposals so farput forward or a reference to the scheme being under con side ration.S w department of Prices and Consumer Protection26 July 19762
