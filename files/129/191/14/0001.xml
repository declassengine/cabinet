PUBLIC EXPENDITURE IN 1976-77   .Memorandum by the Chief Secretary,  TreasuryAt the time of my last progress report to Cabinet on the contingency reserve for 19?6-77 the position was as follows:-  million   million at  1976 At  19?6-77Survey Prices Prices   .Contingency reserve for 1976-77 825 ^75Approved claims 4ll ^55Balance of the contingency reserve 4l4 *i202.    Since then I have had extensive consultations with the Secretaryof State for the Environment about the problem of the excess expendi-ture in the English housing programme which, on the latest estimates,has risen to  208 million at  1976 Survey prices.    Thia excess arises oncouncil house building and on housing subsidies.    The Secretary ofState has agreed to make reductions in other parts of the English housing programme accounting for all but  7*1 million of this excess, and I haveagreed with him that this balance of  ?4 million should be a charge onthe contingency reserve.    In addition I have approved three small itemson other programmes involving  3 million between them,  leaving a balanceof  337-million at 19?6 Survey prices available for dealing with further claims.3.    The Treasury has received a multiplicity of small and medium-sizedfurther actual or potential claims for 1976-77, involving between them 224 million,  as set out in Annex A.    There is also a larger potentialrequirement of  56 million for the e.c. 1 s Second Supplementary budget for 1976.     I will seek to deal with these individually on their meritsaccording to the situation at the time.    I do not propose to involveCabittet in the details of these claims totalling  280 million at thiajuncture, but I invite them to note that the utmost severity will be needed in eliminating or offsetting as many of them as possible.
Balance 337Claims:Local Authority current expenditure(paragraph 4) -280Other expenditure  (paragraph 3) -280- -5601 Excess -2232k.    There are f however,  two major expenditure issues on which decisions are required now.    The first of these is the estimated excess on localauthority current expenditure which,  on the &quot;basis of the revised returnswhich have now been received,  is now put at  250 million this year for england and Wales, with a further figure of the order of  30 million forScotland - all these figures again, being at  1976 Survey prices.    since we lack direct control over this expenditure, we must accept that wehave no means of totally eliminating the excess,  and I should be preparedto recognise that,  after we have done everything possible to get it down to a minimum, we might then have to regard the residual excess aswithin a reasonable margin of tolerance of this vast sum of over 10 billion a year.    However,  at the time of preparation of this report,it had not proved possible to reach agreement among the ministers concerned on steps which could be regarded as adequate to achieve such an effect.    Unless, by the time that this paper is discussed,  it has beenpossible to reach agreement on further measures,  or unless such measures are decided upon in Cabinet,  there will be no alternative but to regard a substantial part of the contingency reserve as pre-empted to offsetthis overspending.5.    The current position is therefore as set out below:-  million1976  SurveypricesBalance of Contingency Reserve  (paragraph l) -        klkAgreed claims  (paragraph 2) - 77
6.    it is against this background that we must consider the proposals*hich are being circulated separately for new job-creation measures,* Covering more limited schemes to an amount of  24 million and a job-swap scheme estimated to involve  118 million.    The amount to bo spentthis year on this whole set of measures,  if they were approved,  is put*t  33 million.     It will be seen from the appraisal which I have setout that,  depending in part on our other decisions,  there can be no certainty that even this amount will be available without exceeding the contingency reserve.    As regards the balance which would fall in1977-78,  the contingency reserve for that year now stands at no more&quot;than  700 million which, with the next financial year still eight months away,  is less than we had in.the contingency reserve for the start of the current financial year and is already too low for&apos; credibility.7.    We have repeatedly stated that we will keep within our plannedtotals of expenditure and that,  for the current year in particular,though we will not yield to pressures to cut expenditure this year,  theamount available in the contingency reserve will not be exceeded.    Atthe best,  acceptance of a batch of substantial new expenditure commat-ments at this juncture could go far to undo the beneficial effects ofthe decisions about 1977-78 which we have just reached with so much difficulty..  But, more particularly, unless we exercise great stringency,the contingency reserve for the current year could rapidly be seen tobe over-committed,  and our ability to live within the contingency, reserve for next year could be called into question. conclusions.    I invite my colleagues -(a) to take note of the limited resources available in the contingency reserve for further commitments at this stages(b) to take account of this in their decisions on any specific proposals requiring immediate decision.JBJ^eaaury ChambersLondon SW1 7juiy  1976 CONFIDENTIAL
