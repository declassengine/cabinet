Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1957SECRETC. (57) 523rd January, 1957CABINETNORTHERN IRELAND: TERRORIST ACTIVITIESMemorandum by the Secretary gf State for the Home Department andLord Privy Seal and the Secretary of State for CommonwealthRelationsIn accordance with the Cabinet decision of 17th December last (C.M. (56)101st Conclusions, Minute 1) H.M. Ambassador in Dublin delivered to theTaoiseaeh, Mr. Costello, on the following day, an Aide^Memoire expressing thevery great concern of Her Majesty&apos;s Government at the recent incidents in NorthernIreland, and their satisfaction that the Irish Republican Government had announced their intention of dealing with the activities of illegal organisations.On 19th December, Sir Anthony Eden made a statement in the House of commons in the same sense.2. The reply of the Irish Republican Government to the Note delivered byH.M. Ambassador is at Annex &quot; A.&quot; A summary of events in the Republic since that date is contained at Annex fi B.&quot;3. Despite the further regrettable incidents which have occurred, of theadmittedly unsatisfactory attitude of the local Courts and of the populardemonstrations which have taken place in the Republic, we are inclined to believethat the Irish Republican Government are determined to do all in their power toquash the activities of illegal organisations operating in or from Irish Republicanterritory. This is borne out by the tone of Mr. Costello&apos;s forthright radio speech to his countrymen on 7th January, and by the individual assurances which H.M.-Ambassador has received from leading Irish Republican Ministers,4. In their reply (Annex &quot; A &quot;) to the United Kingdom Aide-Memoire, theIrish Republican Government endeavour once more to show that the root causeof unlawful military activities js the determination of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentand of the Government of Northern Ireland to perpetuate the partition of thecountry, and that the present evils will never be overcome until the territorial unitypf Ireland has been restored. Mr. Cosgrave, for his part, lias hinted in conversationwith H.M. Ambassador that the time has now come for a new approach to the partition problem. Her Majesty&apos;s Government had shown through their colonial policy that they are essentially liberally minded. Could they not thereforeencourage the North to face the future more realistically?5. It is the view of H.M. Ambassador that Irish Republican Ministers aregenuinely frustrated at the situation in which they find themselves. They see no real prospect ahead for the ending of Partition: first, because pur attitude hasalways been that the matter is primarily one for voluntary discussion between Northand South; and second, because the North in its present temper will not evenconsider the question.6. H.M. Ambassador submits that while we obviously cannot depart from our previous attitude on Partition, there would nonetheless be some advantage inthe light of the Irish Republican Note and of Mr. Cosgrave^s conversations withhim, if he could how be authorised to make an oral communication to theGovernment of Dublin on the following lines--The question of Partition is essentially for discussion between North andSouth. It is not possible for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to intervene in anyway, since changes can be brought about only through voluntary agreementbetween the two Governments directly concerned. However, should irish republican Ministers at any time have specific ideas wjjich they would wish51082 copy No. 49
to outline to Her Majesty&apos;s Government as a preliminary to a possibleapproach to the North, H.M. Ambassador would always be at their disposal.7. In the Ambassador^ opinion an approach on these lines rather than a purely negative attitude on our part, might help to restrain Irish RepublicanMinisters from raising the Partition issue at the United Nations and from continuing to make trouble for us generally, in an effort to court popularity withtheir own electorate. It would also be more likely to keep open the (admittedlyvery distant) prospects of the Irish Republic joining the North Atlantic treaty organisation, or of a United Ireland seeking full membership of the Commonwealth.8. Our colleagues will wish to consider whether matters should now be leftas they stand, or whether some further reply should be made to the variousreferences to Partition contained in the Irish Republican Note in answer to theUnited Kingdom Aide-Memoire, and to the somewhat vague suggestions for animprovement in Anglo-Irish Relations which the Minister for External Affairs,Mr. Cosgrave, has since put to H.M. Ambassador. Since he has himself reportedthat the Irish Republican Government do not favour a further long-range Exchangeof Notes as being unlikely to carry matters much further forward, we would proposethat whatever reply the Ambassador may be instructed to make should be oral.9. Any discussion with the Government in Dublin of the possibility of findingsome way out of the present deadlock over Partition raises important constitutional issues. In our view there can be no doubt that Her Majesty&apos;s Government must stand by their previous declarations as embodied in the Ireland Act, 1949, that northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom and cannot be separated therefrom without the consent of the Parliament of NorthernIreland. Moreover, it is in our view certain that, if it were to become known inNorthern Ireland that Her Majesty&apos;s Government had gone even so far as todiscuss with the Republican Government ideas for the possible future developmentof a United Ireland, they would react very unfavourably. Indeed, recent eventshave undoubtedly hardened feeling in Northern Ireland against the Republic andhave made the prospects of any such move even more remote than they had previously been.10. While, therefore, the Republic may well find itself to some extentfrustrated by the present stalemate, we cannot recommend that H.M. ambassador should be instructed to go as far as he suggests in paragraph 6. above. The mosthe could indicate in the present climate of opinion in the North is that the irish republic should seek, through administrative action, to improve relations between north and South. The Northern Ireland Government have for their part indicated that they would always be willing to meet the Republican Government half way inany proposals for closer co-operation between the two Governments. The kindof co-operation which would be most welcome in Northern Ireland would be on police matters (particularly those affecting security) and extradition (although thelatter would be an embarrassing point to raise at this juncture). But there arealso other subjects, such as transport and the Erne Power project which offeropportunities of collaboration, and thereby of a closer understanding between thetwo Governments.11. We therefore ask our colleagues to agree that H.M. Ambassador in Dublinshould now be instructed to make an oral reply to the Irish Republican Government,restricted to the following points:  (a) That it is only by voluntary agreement between North and South that anychange in the present position can be brought about, and that her majesty&apos;s Government for their part stand firmly by the terms of the Ireland Act, 1949.(b) That the Northern Ireland Government have frequently declared their desire for closer co-operation with the Irish Republican Government,particularly in administrative matters of common concern. irish republican Ministers would realise that practical co-operation of thiskind offers the best means of building up the mutual confidence on whichfuture and wider understandings will have to be based, and if they have any suggestions of this nature which they wish to put forward, they canbe confident that they will receive ready and careful consideration.; R.

inward Telegram to Commonwealth Relations OfficeFROM:    H.M.  AMBASSADOR FOR U.K.   IN DUBLIND: Dublin &quot;22.00 hours 214th December 195^&quot;R: .23.OO hours 2i,th December 1956CYPHER &quot; . ,     qPRIORITY ... .No.  50      CONFIDENTIALMy immediately preceding telegram.Following is text of aide memoire.      Begins.The Government of Ireland have noted, the contents of the aidememoire presented to the Taoiseach by the British Ambassador on.the 18th December 1956.2.      The attitude of the Government towards the unlawful use of force has been fully expressed., in a. number, of. public^statements,including the statements made by the Taoiseach in Dail-Eireann onthe 28th October 135k and the 30th November 1955,  the statement issued by the Government on the lhth December 1956 and the letter dated the 18th December 1956 addressed by the Taoiseach to a memberof Dail Eireann.3-      In&apos;stating their resolve to use all such means as they deem necessary and appropriate to bring unlawful military activities to an end,  the Government have taken their stand on the firmground that such activities are contrary to the moral law andare a challenge to the democratic institutions of this State.Measures which may.be required here to give effect to theirresolve are for determination by the Irish Government,  solely, inthe light of their experience and judgment and in discharge oftheir responsibility to Dail Eireann. \\.vh.      The Government invite the particular attention of the BritishGovernment to those passages in the Taoiseach&apos;s statement of the30th November 1955 in which he pointed out that the responsibilityfor the root cause of unlawful military activities in Ireland -Partition - rests on the British Parliament and Government and onthe Government of the Six Counties.    While fully sharing the desire of the British Government for the continuance of good relations,the Irish Government find it a matter of the dee-pest concern thatthere has so far been no indication of any change of attitude, onthe part of either the British or the Six County Government, towardsthe problem of Partition and that, on the contrary, that attitude which has already had such deplorable consequences has beenreaffirmed in recent public statements.      In particular the references to the Ireland Act 19h9 made by Sir Anthony Eden in theHouse of Commons   on the 19th December 1956 have had the mostregrettable effect on public opinion in this country.5.      The Prime Minister&apos;s claim that the Six Counties are &apos;an integral part of the United Kingdom&apos;  is one that could never inany circumstances be accepted by an Irish Government - as shouldhave been evident from the representations urging the terminationof Partition that have been made so often over the past thirty years to successive British Governments.    The Six Counties are partof the national territory of Ireland and it remains the profoundconviction of the Irish Government that the evils attendant onPartition can be eradicated only by the removal of their basiccause - that is by the restoration of the territorial unity ofIreland/
