Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1957SECRETC. (57) 4828th February, 1957CABINETSINGAPORE constitution memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies on 20th December the Cabinet gave covering approval to the general schemefor the new Singapore Constitution which I had discussed with the Chief Ministerbut asked that further consideration should be given to the implementation of theproposal that The Queen&apos;s Representative should be a local personage of eminencewhile the Representative of the United Kingdom Government would be the headof only one side of the proposed dyarchy but would nevertheless be empowered,if necessary, to suspend the Constitution (CM. (56) 104th Conclusions, Minute 4).2. When a paper was drafted in pursuance of this decision it became clearthat a full description of these two posts could only be made in the context of theproposals for the new Constitution as a whole. These general proposals aretherefore now circulated with this paper in the form of an outline scheme for theUnited Kingdom Bill which will be necessary, and for the Order in Council whichwill set up the new Constitution. In that scheme The Queen&apos;s Representative isgiven the provisional title of Governor and the United Kingdom representative the provisional title of Resident Commissioner. (Sections 4 and 5 of outlineConstitution.) The scheme takes account of inter-Departmental discussion and ofthe views of the Governor and the Commissioner-General.3. These proposals originate in the conception that a Colonial Governornormally exercises a dual function. On the one hand, he represents The Queen asthe formal Head of the local government: on the other he is the agent of theUnited Kingdom Government for the protection and pursuit of United kingdom interests and policy. Singapore Ministers are insistent that a political settlementcan be reached only by separating these functions and entrusting the formalfunction of representing the Head of State to a Malayan-born personage. this paper sets out how such an arrangement will work in practice. It should however be noted that it is not proposed that this separation of functions should take placeimmediately, but that the new Constitution should have a &quot; running-in &quot; period ofat least a year from its inception (probably late 1957) before a local personage takesover the representative function.4. The new Constitution will be a form of dyarchy. The United kingdom representative will not be answerable to The Queen&apos;s Representative in thedischarge of United Kingdom responsibilities in Singapore. His dealings will be with Singapore Ministers, whose duty it will be to collaborate with him in thedischarge of those responsibilities, and he will be directly responsible to her majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. He will, however, have the rightto advise The Queen&apos;s Representative to reserve for Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure anyBills which he considers affect the discharge of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentsresponsibilities.51261 copy No.
The Queen&apos;s Representative M   , ,5. The proposal is that The Queems Representative in Singapore should beappointed by The Queen on the advice of the Secretary of State in the same way that a Colonial Governor is appointed. He would hold office during Her Majesty&apos;pleasure. Before advising The Queen the Secretary of State would consultSingapore Ministers, who would propose a name or names for his consideration,but it is not suggested that Singapore Ministers should have the right to tenderadvice to The Queen on this or any other matter. As indicated above, theGovernor will be a Malayan-born person.6. The Queen&apos;s Representative would have very much less authority than is enjoyed by a Colonial Governor. He would act in accordance with RoyalInstructions issued to him. He would be the Head of the executive Governmentand assent to laws passed by the legislative council, but in the exercise of his powers he would be bound (subject to reservation of certain categories of Bills) toact in accordance with the advice of local Ministers and he would retain a degreeof personal discretion only in relation to such matters as the selection of a chief minister and the dissolution of the Legislative Assembly. When it was necessaryfor the Singapore Government to address the United Kingdom Government onsuch matters as petitions to The Queen, a communication, conveying the views of singapore Ministers, would be sent in the name of The Queen&apos;s Representative tothe Secretary of State, who would be responsible for advising The Queen on theaction to be taken thereon.7. The office of Queen&apos;s Representative would not be abolished upon theexercise by the United Kingdom Government of its power to suspend theConstitution any more than the Governor^ appointment was abolished when it proved necessary to suspend the Constitution in British Guiana. The UnitedKingdom Government Representative would be given powers previously exercised by local Ministers, and would advise The Queen&apos;s Representative in their stead. Itis however possible that in such circumstances the holder of the office of Queen&apos;representative would on personal grounds feel moved to resign his office; it is also possible that in certain circumstances the United Kingdom Government might think it wise to advise The Queen to terminate the appointment of the currentholder of the office and to appoint someone else in his place. Neither of thesecontingencies would affect the continuance of the office of Queen&apos;s Representative.The Constitution would not itself specify that The Queen&apos;s Representative had tobe locally born, so that in these circumstances there would be no bar to theappointment of any person the United Kingdom Government wished torecommend to The Queen.United Kingdom Government Representative8. The United Kingdom Representative in Singapore would be appointed on the authority of United Kingdom Ministers. He would be the agent in singapore of the United Kingdom Government and in that capacity would exercisecertain functions relating to the matters for which the United KingdomGovernment will retain responsibility, that is to say, the defence and exFernalaffairs of Singapore. He would preside over the Internal Security Council andthe Defence and External Affairs Council and would have the right to receivecopies of the papers and minutes of the Council of Ministers. He would also have the right, if in his view any Bill passed by the Singapore Legislature affectedmatters within the sphere of responsibility of the United Kingdom Government,so to inform the Queen&apos;s Representative who would then be obliged by theConstitution to reserve the Bill for Her Majesty&apos;s assent; in such cases the UnitedKingdom Government would tender advice to Her Majesty. This last right has yet to be negotiated with Singapore Ministers.9. Should it become necessary for the Constitution to be suspended, an Orderin Council would be made, revoking the existing Constitution and making freshprovision for the government of Singapore. To provide for an emergency situation,the United Kingdom Representative would be empowered to publish an Orderenabling him to assume the government of Singapore for a limited period, duringwhich the Order in Council suspending the Constitution could be made. Thecontinuance of the office of Queen&apos;s Representative would not be affected by either of these procedures.
Repercussions Elsewhere; 10. The Australian and New Zealand Governments have been informed ofthese proposals and have no objections1 in principle to them. These are theCommonwealth countries most directly concerned in Singapore affairs. It is unlikely that Canada or South Africa would object. The Asian Members of theCommonwealth are also Unlikely to oppose a step which confers upon Singaporea symbol Of local self-government which is greatly desired and those members who recognise Her Majesty only as Head of the Commonwealth are not directly concerned with arrangements for the representation of The Queen in those partsof the Commonwealth of which she is Sovereign. It is however possible that theappointment in Singapore of a locally-born person as the Representative ofThe Queen might be cited as a precedent by other Colonial territories nearingthe stage of self-government (particularly those who cannot look forward tocomplete independence) for similar appointments to be made in their case. Itwould be necessary to consider each such case on merits if and when it arose.11. I am assured that these arrangements would not offend Constitutionalpropriety...v A.
