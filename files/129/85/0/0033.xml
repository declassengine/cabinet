secret.(57) 3313th February, 1957REMUNERATION O&quot; DOCTORS AND DENTISTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of HealthTerms of Reference and MembershipThe Cabinet, on 24th January, agreed in principle to propose theestablishment of a Royal Commission on the remuneration of doctors and dentists and invited us to reconsider with the Chancellor of theExchequer, in the light of their discussion, its composition and terms ofreference (CM.(57) 3rd Conclusions, Minute 2).2. The principal point at issue on the terms of reference is whatclasses of doctors and dentists are to be covered.   We should prefer thescope of the enquiry to be as wide as possible, in order to avoid thedanger that (like the Spens Committees) the Royal Commission might consider doctors and dentists in the National Health Service in isolationfrom the rest of their professions.   In particular, we are under pressure from the profession to initiate an enquiry into the remuneration of doctors in the local government service and feel strongly that these atleast should be included.3. A proposed invitation to the Royal Commission to consider theestablishment of standing advisory machinery (to which future claims forincreased remuneration could be referred) is intended to provide permanentmeans of preserving the proper relativities with remuneration in other professions and to make it clear that there is no right to automatic adjust-ment to meet changes in the cost of living.   It is thought that this might be acceptable to the profession as a means of avoiding periodic disputes.4. With these points in mind, we propose the following revisedterms of reference -&quot;To consider -(a)  the total professional remuneration from ail sources now received by doctors and dentists taking any part in theNational Health Service or in the employment of localauthorities, in comparison with the remuneration receivedby other members of the medical and dental professions, bypeople engaged in connected occupations and by members ofother professions;COPY NO,CABINET
(b) what principles should govern the levels of remuneration of such doctors and dentists by the National Health Serviceand by local authorities; and what should be the properlevels of that remuneration;(c) whether, and if so what, arrangements should be made tobring that remuneration under periodical future review;and to make recommendations. &quot;5. We suggest that the Royal Commission should consist of not morethan ten members, none of them medical, under a non-legal chairman;and we hope that our colleagues will agree that we should select them, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Interim Offer to Limited Classes6. The Cabinet agreed also in principle that the doctors should be offered an interim increase in remuneration, confined to certain classeswho are underpaid at present, and invited us to consider, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the amount of such interim increase.7. We are satisfied that the offer to negotiate an interim increasecan and should be confined to the junior hospital doctors and dentists,whose maximum salary is at present  1,400. The recipients, as distinct from the amount, of the increase would not be a question for negotiation.8. We consider - and we understand that the Chancellor agrees -that it isrpossible to justify an immediate increase of 1 0 per cent forthis class.   To go higher would have embarrassing repercussions on the remuneration of senior hospital staff.    We should, however, open negotiations with an offer of l\ per cent.   The cost of 1 0 per cent wouldbe, for England and Wales and Scotland, of the order of  900,000 a year.Announcement to the F-rofession9. 7/e wish to announce the Royal Commission to the representativesof the doctors in the National Health Service when we meet them on20th February.   No suggestion has yet been made to the dental professionor to the local government organisations that the enquiry should also coverdentists and local government doctors.    We do not think it  practicable,owing to the danger of leakage, to consult these interests before themeeting on 20th February.   We therefore suggest that the announcement atthat meeting should be on the following lines -(1)   The Government have decided that the time has come to under-take a full review of medical remuneration, through anindependent enquiry.(2)  They have decided to recommend forthwith the establishmentof a Royal Commission for this purpose.(3)  They think that this review should extend beyond doctors inthe National Health Service; but, before coming to any final conclusion, they would naturally wish to consult the other interests involved.   For instance, doctors in the localgovernment services and the dental profession have to beconsidered in this regard.
(4)  Subject to this point, it is proposed that the reference tothe Commission would be to ask them to consider -(a) the total professional remuneration from all sources now received by doctors and dentists taking any part in theNational Health Service or in the employment of localauthorities, in comparison with the remunerationreceived by other members of the medical and dentalprofessions, by people engaged in connected occupations and by members of other professions;(b) what principles should govern the levels of remuneration of such doctors and dentists by the National health service and by local authorities; and what should be theproper levels of that remuneration;(c) whether, and if so what, arrangements should be madeto bring that remuneration under periodal future review;and to make recommendations.(5)  The medical profession and any others concerned would beinformed of the proposed membership as soon as necessarycontacts with any other interests were completed. It is not proposed to agree either the terms of reference or the membership with the medical profession or with anyone else.(6)   In addition, and without waiting for the results of this enquiry,the Government are willing at once to recommend theManagement Side of the Whitley Council concerned to offer to negotiate an interim increase for junior hospital staff.(N.B.  No other categories will be included.)10.        It may be thought necessary to make some announcement inFarliament at the same time as to the profession, subject always to wordingit to safeguard (3) above.Negotiations11.        The negotiations on an interim increase for the junior hospital doctors could begin shortly after 20th February.   But it is very probablethat they will be delayed by demands from the profession that the increase should not be confined to this class alone, which - even if not discussed -will consume time.   It would be surprising if the negotiations could be concluded in less than two months from their inception.   It is probable,therefore, that the Governments proposed announcement of increases forthe lower paid members of other professional classes and for Members ofFarliament will be made while the negotiations with the doctors are stillin progress.   If these other increases are of more than 10 per cent, themedical negotiations will be made more difficult but not impossible.J.S.M.D. ;.V.13th February, 1957
