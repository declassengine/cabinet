secret.(57) 224th February, 1957CABINETEXPORTS OF COPPER WIRE TO RUSSIAMemorandum by the president  of theBoard of trade the Foreign Secretary and I wish to bring to our colleagues the question of granting a licence for 10,000 tons of copper wire for russia.   He feels that a licence should be refused.2. In August 1954 copper wire was freed from embargo but the americans now want &quot;a sharp curtailment&quot; in its export to eastern europe.3, Production of raw copper in the soviet bloc is about 400,000tons a year plus 100,000 tons of imports.   The Ministry of Defencethink that the Russians have enough copper of their own to meet strictly military needs without difficulty.4. United Kingdom exports of copper wire to the U.S.S.R. in thelast three years have been -1954 1955 19565,000 tons 23,000 tons 40,000 tons( 1.5m.) ( 8.6m.) ( 15m.)Last year Crompton Parkinson sold 33,000 tons of copper wire toRussia and the balance came from Aberdare Cables against a licence for 10,000 tons.5. For 1957, we have already promised Crompton Parkinson40,000 tons.   Aberdare Cables are applying for 10,000 tons.   If we refusethis 10,000 we shall be accused of favouring Crompton Parkinson and theRussians can place the order elsewhere.   Moreover, Aberdare Cables arein the South Wales Development Area where we do not want to see unemploy-ment.6. We are morally committed to Aberdare Cables and I considerthat we should give them the licence.   We can then discuss future exportswith the Americans without having given in to them in advance.D.E.Board of Trade, S.W.1.copy NO.r
