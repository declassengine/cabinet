Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1957SECRET Copy No.C. (57) 4225th February 1957CABINETPUBLIC SERVICE salaries memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer for some time now the Government have been resisting strong pressure forthe adjustment of salaries in a number of public and semi-public services. In somecases the Government have already admitted that adjustments are necessary; theyhave done this, for example, in the case of Members of Parliament and Membersof the Nationalised Industry Boards. In one case, that of the Lower Judiciary, theGovernment even decided (in the summer of last year) what should be done butpostponed implementation. The main reason for holding up these adjustmentshas, of course, been the Governments call for wage restraint as part of its policyof steadying the rise in costs and prices. The thought has been that the adjustmentsshould wait until they can be made without damage to this policy.2. In my view, we shall never achieve an ideal time for these salary changes.Later in the year it may very likely be more rather than less difficult to concedethem than now. I feel that we cannot and should not hold them up much longer.I propose, therefore, that we should choose the best time in the near future anddeal with them all as nearly as possible simultaneously. And I suggest that mostof them at any rate should be covered by a single announcement. No doubt suchan announcement will have a bigger impact than any one item in it would by itself.But the impact would be much less than that caused in all by a series ofannouncements made over a period. And the whole thing would soon be forgotten.3. The time I have in mind for the general announcement is mid-March. Thecurrent round of wage negotiations will not then be over; but the pattern will bemore or less set, and I should not expect it to be greatly influenced by such anannouncement about public salaries. I would like the operation out of the waybefore the Budget.4. If we are to work to this time-table, I need the early approval of mycolleagues for this general plan, and to know their views on a number of particular points relating to the various salary groups affected.Members of parliament. In Appendix A I set out the recent history of Members&apos; salaries, and consider various alternatives for their adjustment. My own preference is forabolition of the sessional allowance and a straight increase of salary to  1,750. Ichoose this figure because, on the one hand, an increase to  2,000 (though I amtempted by it largely in the hope of settling the matter for many years) would bestriking and might cause unfavourable comment; while on the other hand, anincrease to  1,500 would give a Member only some  200 more than, with salaryplus sessional allowance, he has at present, and rather less than the 1946 purchasingpower of  1,000.6. To my mind it is highly desirable that whatever we do in this field shouldbe acceptable to the Opposition as well, of course, as to the majority of our own supporters. I suggest that we should have an early discussion with opposition leaders. I would defer a decision between the three figures mentioned above until we know the Opposition views.51246b
7. No legislation is involved; the adjustment in salary can be made simplyby a Resolution of the House.(\ *-i Ministers8. In Appendix B I set out the recent history of ministers salaries, and discuss possible plans for their adjustment. My own preference is for the plan which gives all Ministers an increase in salary (graduated in amount from  1,500to senior Ministers down to  500 to Whips) and in addition allows all Ministers inthe Commons to draw the full Parliamentary salary. This plan if my suggestion of a Parliamentary salary of  1,750 is adopted would give senior Ministers inthe Commons a total remuneration of  8,250. I do not consider, however, thatwe should attempt to take final decisions about Ministers until we know what is tobe the new Parliamentary salary. If we go to  2,000 for that in the end, we shall need to decide whether we think that a total of  8,500 for senior Ministers in the commons (which this would produce) is in itself rather too high or that a gap of 2,000 between Ministers in the Commons and those in the Lords is too wide. Ifwe did think either or both of these things, we could limit the entitlement to draw the House of Commons salary for all Ministers to a maximum of  1,500. But Ido not personally advocate this.9. Again, it is most important that we carry the Opposition with us on anysuch plan. I therefore suggest that the proposed discussion with the Oppositionon Members&apos; salaries should cover Ministers&apos; salaries also. If, in discussion withthe Opposition, we are able to devise a plan which is acceptable to both sides, theBill to give effect to it should pass through Parliament with the minimum ofdiscussion.10. I would also propose to insert in the Bill a Clause applying the termsof the Injury Warrant to Ministers travelling on duty. (A memorandum on thissubject (C (54) 198) was circulated to the Cabinet by the then Chancellor of theExchequer on 16th June, 1954.) It is, to my mind, absurd that Ministers shouldnot have the benefit of the Injury Warrant, and thus be the only servants of theCrown for whom (or for whose dependants) no provision is made in the event of death or injury on duty. This proposal, too, ought to be mentioned to theOpposition.Peers&apos; Allowances11. If we are to move on the salaries of Members and Ministers, we ought,at the same time, to implement the plan which we approved last year for expensesallowances for Peers. This provided for the reimbursement of the expenses incurred by Peers in attending the House up to a maximum of  3 a day.An allowance in this form would not be taxable. Each Peer would have to signa declaration that he had actually incurred expenses of the amount claimed, buthe would not have to produce vouchers or accounts. It has not been contemplated that Ministers in the Lords might draw this allowance and I do not think that itwould be possible to make them eligible to do so. It would be even less defensibleto do so than it would be to permit Ministers in the Commons to draw the presentsessional allowance. Peers who are Ministers do not incur any extra expenditure which they could certify as arising from their attendance at the House.Nationalised Industries Boards12. The recent history of the salaries of the Nationalised Boards is dealt within Appendix C. I suggest that we approve the plan which has been worked outby officials, and which makes the fop level salary  10,000. Legislation is notrequired.Lower Judiciary13. I give the recent history of the salaries of the Lower Judiciary inAppendix D. In this case, the new salaries are already agreed between Ministers,and a Bill is being drafted to make the adjustments in those cases where legislation is necessary. I recommend that we now decide to announce a decision tointroduce this Bill.
Comptroller and Auditor-General14. Legislation is necessary to give to the Comptroller and Auditor-Generalthe new salary ( 6,000) of a Permanent Secretary, and the Home Affairs committee approved the preparation of a Bill on 22nd October (HP (56) 17th Meeting). i recommend that the introduction of this Bill too should now be approved.University Teachers15. I am proposing to accept recommendations recently made to me bythe University Grants Committee for increased salaries for University staffs. i will not trouble my colleagues with details. Some idea of their general ordercan be gained from the fact that assistant lecturers and lecturers (now paid salariesranging from  550 to  1,350) will receive 25-30 per cent, more, and that themaximum for professors will be raised from  2,850 to  3,000. The total cost ina full year will be  3 millions; the new salaries will come into effect from thebeginning of the next academic year.16. The University Grants Committee are very anxious that the salariesshould be announced as soon as possible in order that they may have the maximumimpact on recruitment, which in some scientific and technical faculties is verydifficult. I was at first inclined to hold this announcement for inclusion in thegeneral announcement which I am proposing for mid-March. But I have cometo the conclusion that University salaries are a rather separate item, and thatwe might allow the announcement to be made on its own and a little beforethe rest.Doctors17. . The doctors&apos; representatives have now been told of the governments proposals to set up a Royal Commission and to open negotiations for an earlyincrease for the lower-paid Hospital doctors. I mention this only for the sake of completeness, since it represents a movement in the salary field. But it is in adifferent category from the other items discussed in this memorandum, since thereis no prospect of announcing an actual pay award in mid-March or earlier.18. Having surveyed the field, I now turn to the terms of the generalannouncement. It will require very careful drafting, since we must avoid giving any impression that the economic outlook has suddenly become rosy. It should,I think, refer to Members of Parliament, Peers, Ministers, the Lower Judiciaryand members of Nationalised Industry Boards. The general theme might be thatthere has for a long time been a general recognition of the fact that salaries in theseoccupations were out of date; and that the Government has now come to theconclusion that, although economic conditions are still difficult, the time for actionon them has arrived. I also suggest that, in view of the importance of theannouncement and of the fact that it concerns in part the remuneration of ministers themselves, it ought perhaps to be made by the Prime Minister himself.19.   To sum up, I recommend:   .(i) That the Prime Minister should make a general announcement in mid-March that the Government has decided to proceed with the adjustment of the public salaries mentioned in paragraph 18.(ii) That we should open immediate discussions with the Opposition aimed at securing their support for a plan for adjusting the pay of members and Ministers and for allowances for Peers.(iii) That the salary adjustments for Nationalised Industry Board members should be those worked out by officials and based on the assumptionthat the top level salary should become  10,000.(iv) That as soon as practicable after the announcement we should introduceBills dealing with the salaries of Ministers, the Lower Judiciary and the comptroller and Auditor-General.(v) That the announcement of the adjustment of the University salaries neednot be held up for the general announcement.P. T.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,22nd February, 1957.51246
Appendix AMEMBERS&apos; SALARIESThe salary of the Member of Parliament was increased from  600 to  1,000in 1946. Expenses which are wholly, necessarily and exclusively incurred by aMember in the discharge of his functions are deducted from his parliamentary salary before its assessment for tax. A Member also receives some assistance in&quot;kind the most important item being railway vouchers for free travel between london, his home and his constituency.2. In 1953, a Select Committee appointed to consider the expenses ofMembers recommended a straight increase in salary of  1,500. The solution finallyadopted was the sessional allowance of  2 for every day (other than Fridays) onwhich the House sits, and works out at about  280 in a normal year.3. The Government has accepted that there is a case for an increase in the pay of Members. In the House on 12th July, 1956, the then Prime Minister said:&quot; I do not deny that some increase in the salary of Members would bejustified if there were not special considerations .... An increase here atthis time in the full glare of publicity, in which we have to live as Membersof Parliament whether we like it or whether we do not, cannot but have its effect on other sections of the community, at a time when we are urgingrestraint.&quot;4. Various plans for an increase of pay for Members were worked out lastyear and were reviewed by the Lord Privy Seal and other Ministers. The mostmodest was for an increase in the amount of sessional allowance and its payment for Fridays. But this would be an unsatisfactory stop-gap measure. A muchmore satisfactory plan would be to abolish the sessional allowance and grant a straight increase in the Members&apos; salary which might become  1,500,  1,750 orThese have been virtually unchanged for many years. They are currentlyprescribed in the Ministers of the Crown Act, 1937, as modified by the ministerial salaries Act, 1946. Senior Ministers receive nothing more than their ministerial salaries ( 5,000), but other Ministers are in addition allowed  500 of their parliamentary salary. They are not entitled to the sessional allowance paid to members. Any move to vary either their salary or the amount of parliamentary salary they are allowed requires legislation.2. The least obtrusive way of helping Ministers in the Commons would beto allow them their full Parliamentary salary. The main difficulty about dealingwith the problem in this way is that it would do nothing for Ministers in the Lords.3. In view of this difficulty it seems necessary to improve the actual salaries of Ministerial office, at any rate in the case of junior Ministers. If it were desiredto limit the adjustment of Ministerial salaries to Ministers below the (present) 5,000 level, a possible plan would be to improve the salary of a Minister of state by  500 and that of Ministers below him by another  1,000. Table A below shows the effect of this, on the assumption that all Ministers in the Commons are madeeligible to draw a Parliamentary salary of  1,750. 2,000.Appendix BMINISTERS&apos; SALARIEStable a gross EmolumentsPresent       New   minister of statesenior minister,000 6J505,000        5,0003,500 5,2503,000        3,500financial and economic secretariescommons2,500       4 750parliamentary secretary ...whip
The main criticism of the final column of this table is that, while, the junior ministers are on the heels of the senior Ministers in the Commons, they are stillrelatively badly off in the Lords. This difficulty can only be eased by improving the  5,000 present salary of senior Ministers. Thus the salary of a senior minister might be increased to  6,500; if in addition a Parliamentary salary of  1,750 werepayable, the senior Minister in the Commons would draw  8,250 in total. Theincrease in Ministerial salaries might be graduated downwards from, the  1,500to  500 at the other end of the scale (for the Whips) so as to avoid what would otherwise be disproportionate total increases at the lower end of the scale. Theresult might be as follows (the figures for the Lords showing, of course, the suggested new salaries attached to actual Ministerial office):TABLE BSenior Minister   ...      ...      .........Minister of State .........Financial and Economic Secretaries    ......(The Ministerial salary of these Ministers wouldbe increased on this plan by  1,250)Parliamentary Secretary......      ......Whip       ......    .............This plan is attractive. The salary of a Cabinet Minister would still be moderatein relation to his responsibilities. His total emoluments if in the Commons wouldbe slightly above those of a High Court Judge. The top rate of pay in the CivilService is  6,500 and in the Nationalised Industry Boards we are consideringincreasing it to  10,000.4. The above tables leave out of account the position of the Prime minister himself, and certain other special cases. These might more appropriately beconsidered when a general plan is settled.

The Fleck Report on the national coal Board and the Herbert Report on the Central Electricity Authority bothrecommend considerable increases in pay as an aid to recruitment.2. The Government has so far taken the line in public that, while there ismuch to be said for a review of the salaries of Board members, in present economic circumstances it is not possible to make a move.3. Last year a group of officials prepared a plan for a revised salary structurefor the Nationalised Industry Boards. This was drawn up on the basis that the salaries of the most highly paid posts would be fixed at  10,000 a year in placeof the present maximum of  8,500. Examples of the salary changes proposed are set out in the following table:  	Present Pay  	Proposed Pay  Chairman (Central Electricity Authority and Transport Commission)         ...      ............	8,500	10,000Chairman (Coal Board)	7,500	10,000Chairman (Gas Area Board)        ............	4,500	6,500Member (Coal Board and Transport Commission)......	5,000	7,500Part-timer	500	750 or  1,000
Appendix DLOWER JUDICIARYDuring the first half of 1956, an agreement was reached between the ministers concerned on a scheme of revised salary scales for the Lower Judiciary. Thefollowing examples illustrate the amount of the adjustments proposed:  2. Some of the increases have already been introduced. For example, themembers of the Lands Tribunal were given the increased salaries on recruitmentgrounds, and the Masters and Registrars because they are linked for pay purposesrather with the Civil Service than with the Judiciary. But the majority are stillwaiting, although in a number of cases the increase in salary does not involve legislation. Legislation is required in two cases only the County Court Judge,and the Metropolitan Magistrate.3. On August 2nd, the Cabinet decided that legislation on the salaries ofthe Lower Judiciary should be linked with legislation on Ministers&apos; salaries anddeferred for the time being (CM. (56) 57th Conclusions, Minute 2). The LordChancellor and the Secretary of State for Scotland have told those members ofthe Lower Judiciary who have not had their increases that the Government hopesto take the necessary legislative action in the course of the current Session. Itreally would be most unfair to keep them waiting much longer; after all, the High.Court Judges had their increase almost 3 years ago.PresentPav &apos; ProposedCounty Court Judge ...Metropolitan MagistrateSheriffs Substitute Group A2,8002,5002,400Pav 3,7503,2503,250
