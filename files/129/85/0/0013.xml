Printed for the Cabinet: January 1957SECRET, Copy No.C. (57). 13   ;29th January, 1957CABINETNAVAL DISCIPLINEMemorandum by the First Lord of the admiralty fully concur with the attached memorandum by my predecessor on thereport from the Select Committee on the Naval Discipline Act and urge mycolleagues to agree that the Bill referred to should be introduced during the presentAdmiralty, S.W. 1,22nd January, 1957.Memorandum by the First Lord of the admiralty the report from the Select Committee on the Naval Discipline Act has nowbeen published. It contains the draft of a completely new Naval Discipline Bill.Some of the more important changes are summarised in Appendix B for theinformation of the Cabinet.2. In placing their proposals before the Select Committee, the Admiraltyrecognised that, except where there is some compelling naval reason for a differentprocedure, the Naval Discipline Act of the future should follow the pattern of thenew Army and Air Force Acts. This recognition and the work done by the WarOffice, the Air Ministry and the Select Committee on the Army Act and theAir Force Act have greatly facilitated the task. The result is a draft Bill whichretains a distinctive naval flavour, while containing enough of the Army andAir Force Acts to satisfy those who argue that so far as practicable the services should be treated alike.3. Inevitably the Select Committee&apos;s draft Bill is hot in every detail whatthe Admiralty would have wished. In some cases the Committee have recommended the adoption of the Army&apos;s model when the Admiralty would have preferred something different; in other cases they have refused to follow theArmy&apos;s pattern exactly when the Admiralty would have wished to do so. Theseare minor points, however, and there is only one matter on which the Board ofAdmiralty feel unable to accept the draft Bill.  This is discussed in Appendix A.4. Except on a few points the Select Committee&apos;s recommendations havebeen reached without a division. That and the Admiralty&apos;s willingness to acceptthe recommendations save in one respect should mean that the Bill will beuncontroversial.5. Although the prospect of legislation on this subject was not mentioned inThe Queen&apos;s Speech (for reasons which I understand), I think that Parliament willbe rightly critical if the Bill is not introduced during the present session. The Selectsession.SELKIRK.51122b
APPENDIX ATHE COMPOSITION OF COURTS-MARTIALSection 58 (2) of the.present Naval Discipline Act says that &quot;no officer shallbe qualified to sit as a member of any court-martial.....unless he be a flag officer, captain, commander, lieutenant-commander or lieutenant of Her Majesty&apos;snavy on full pay,&quot; When those words were written, the ranks referred only toseaman officers, because all other officers bore different titles such as FleetPaymaster or Inspector of Machinery; and even after the words &quot;captain,&quot;&quot;commander,&quot; &amp;c. appeared in the ranks of other branches the membership of courts-martial continued to be confined to the executive branch. So long as theofficer structure of the Navy was organised on traditional lines, the Admiraltybelieved that only executive officers, who had particular qualifications to deal withdisciplinary matters, should sit. For this reason the Pilcher Committee&apos;recommendation that all officers should be eligible was resisted.2. The new officer structure of the Navy has completely changed the position.Officers of the General List (viz. Engineer, Supply and Electrical as well as SeamanOfficers) have already shed their distinction cloth and the suffixes (E), (S) and (L)in their titles. From 1st. January, 1957, they will be borne on a common senioritylist and will be eligible to sit on courts-martial. On the other hand the principle underlying the new structure is that all officers are of one company and theAdmiralty believe that one way of demonstrating this is to make them all eligible to sit on courts-martial if they are of appropriate rank, leaving it to the conveningauthority to nominate the most suitable. This is the system which has workedperfectly well in the Army and the Royal Air Force for many years., 3.) The Select Committee by a majority rejected the simple clause which was put before them and substituted the following clause:  ....1 &quot; 54.-0) A1 court-martial shall consist of hot less&apos; than five nor morethan nine officers subject to this&apos; Act who are of or above the rank, of lieutenant,&apos;    holding permanent commissions and on full pay, being-id) officers&quot;on the&apos;General List or Special Duties List of the Royal Navy;(b) officers in the Seaman, Engineering, Supply and Secretariat, or Electrical&apos;&apos;  Branch of any of the naval reserve forces;Committee might well feel slighted if effect were not given to their excellent workuntil a later session. Apart from that we have now been trying for six years tomodernise the Naval Discipline Act. The plans for an amending Bill in 1951 fell-through for reasons beyond the Admiralty&apos;s control. The setting up of a SelectCommittee in 1952 to consider the other two Acts meant that no further progress could be made with the Naval Discipline Act until they had reported. Thesedelays, coupled with the Admiralty&apos;s undeserved reputation for conservatism indisciplinary matters (springing no doubt from the antiquity of the present code),have given rise to suspicions that we really have no intention of making a change.Any delay in introducing an uncontroversial Bill advocated by a Select committee must intensify these suspicions.6. The amount of Parliamentary time expended on the three disciplinaryBills of 1955 was very small indeed compared to their scope; and, as so much ofthe ground will be familiar to Parliament by virtue of those Bills, there is reason to hope that this one will pass even more easily.7.   I therefore seek the approval of the Cabinet:  (a) to the draft Bill, subject to the revised version of the clause on the composition of courts-martial proposed in Appendix A;(b) to accord the-Bill an early place in the legislative programme for this session.H.Admiralty, S.W. 1,8th January, 1957.
(c) officers of the marine forces; or(d) officers of the naval forces of any Commonwealth country; or raised underthe law of any colony.(2) The members of a court-martial, and such spare members as theauthority ordering the court-martial considers appropriate for the purpose offilling vacancies, shall be nominated by that authority.(3) The officer Who orders a court-martial shall not be a member of thecourt-martial; and no court-martial shall consist of officers all of whom belong to the same ship or naval establishment.(4) The president of a court-martial shall not be below the rank ofcaptain, and in the case of a court-martial for the trial of an officer of flagrank shall be an officer of flag rank.(5) The president of a court-martial and not less than half the othermembers of the court shall be officers who have acquired a bridge watch-keeping certificate during their service in the rank of lieutenant or sub-lieutenant.(6) A court-martial for the trial of an officer of flag rank shall not include any member below the rank of captain.(7) A court-martial for the trial of a commodore or captain shall not include any member below the rank of commander.(8) A court-martial for the trial of a commander shall include at least two members, in addition to the president, who are not below the rank of commander.(9) If the authority ordering a court-martial nominates as members ofthat court id) more than two officers who belong to the same ship or naval establishmentas the accused;(b) more than two officers who are serving on his own staff; or(c) any officer below the rank of commander where the accused is an officer, orbelow the rank of lieutenant-commander where the accused is a rating.a statement of the circumstances which, in the opinion of that authority, madethose nominations necessary shall be transmitted to the Admiralty with the record of the proceedings of the court.&quot;This clause has the following unsatisfactory features:  (a) It excludes from membership all officers of the new Supplementary List,who correspond to the Navy&apos;s present Short Service officers. Many ofthese officers are eligible to sit now. They may in future have up to twelve years&apos; service and so be perfectly suitable to sit. As many ofthem will be aviators, they would be particularly suitable to try flyingoffences. As the Navy will have to rely on them even more than in thepast, it is undesirable to suggest that they are in this respect inferior.(b) The requirement that only officers holding permanent commissions shouldbe eligible cuts out all temporary officers of the Reserves. Many ofthese would prove in wartime to be better qualified for the work than some of the officers holding permanent commissions in the Reserves.(c) The clause as drafted would make certain officers of Commonwealth Navieseligible who would not be eligible if they belonged to the Royal Navy.(This is because paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) of. the clause is notgoverned by the limitations in paragraphs (a) and (b)).id) Sub-section (5) requires the president and not less than half the othermembers to be officers holding a bridge watchkeeping certificate. Inother words, it is designed to perpetuate the predominance of seamanofficers. Certainly the Pilcher Committee recommended that themajority of any court should be executive officers; but it was nevercontemplated that statutory force should be given to thisrecommendation. Similarly, for the time being at any rate and certainlyuntil officers of other specialisations have gained experience in generalduties, the Admiralty will wish to advise convening authorities to nominate a high proportion of seamen. That will be well understood inthe Fleet; but to give it statutory force would be inconvenient,inflexible, unnecessary and unduly discouraging to the aspirations of- many officers.    &quot;      &apos; ;&apos;&quot;        : &apos; &apos; &apos;51122      &apos;  &apos;r&apos; &apos; &quot;   . V       &apos;    &apos;    &apos;        &apos; i     ,       B 2
(e) Subsection (9), which requires the convening authority to report his reasons to the Admiralty if he nominates officers of certain ranks andappointments, is unduly restrictive. For example, Lieutenant-Commander (Flying) at a Naval Air Station might be a very suitableperson to sit on a court trying a young pilot for a flying offence and itwould be vexatious to have to write down special reasons fornominating him because he was not a Commander.ip The requirement that courts-martial should be confined to officers on fullpay is Otiose: every officer who could conceivably be nominated to-day would be on full pay.4. The Admiralty would like to replace subsection (1) of the clause by thefollowing provisions and to delete subsections (5) and (9):  &quot; (1) A court-martial shall consist of not less than five nor more thannine officers, being officers of Her Majesty&apos;s naval forces subject to this Actwho are of or above the rank of lieutenant.&quot; (2) An officer shall not be appointed a member of a court-martial unless he has held a commission in any of the armed forces of the Crown for a periodof not less than three years or for periods amounting in the aggregate to notless than three years.&quot;On further consideration the Admiralty think that the limitation to officers whohave held a commission for three years (which derives from the Army Act) is a useful provision and that it may help to reconcile the Select Committee to someof the other alterations proposed.5. The Chairman of the Select Committee is aware that the Board are unableto accept the clause as drafted. He advised against a further attempt to persuade them to alter it on the&apos; ground that this might cause delay and prevent theCommittee from completing their task in the last session. He thinks that there willbe no difficulty in getting Parliament to pass the revised version proposed above.Not only is it more liberal than the other but it is likely to commend itself to theOpposition.APPENDIX BSOME IMPORTANT CHANGESMutiny. The Select Committee have recommended three clauses which areidentical in effect with the corresponding sections of the new Army and Air force acts. This is particularly desirable because men from different Services couldbe charged with committing mutiny together.Death Penalty for Service Offences. The Select Committee have acceptedthe Admiralty&apos;s recommendation that, the mandatory death penalty be abolished and death retained as the maximum punishment only for offences committed with intent to assist the enemy and for the more serious kinds of mutiny. The draftBill is thus in line with the new Army and Air Force Acts.Flying Offences. As the Fleet Air Arm is now an integral part of the royal navy, specific offences relating to aircraft are being introduced for the first time.Hitherto most flying offences have had to be charged as neglect of duty or asacts to the prejudice of good order and naval discipline in contravening the relevantregulation. - These new Offences closely follow those laid down in the Air ForceAct; but the Select Committee have gone Out of their way to reduce the maximumpenalty for annoyance by flying from two years&apos; imprisonment to dismissal from her Majesty&apos;s service. There is no particular objection to this from the Admiralty&apos;spoint of view; but the public might think that the offence was more lightlyregarded in the Navy than in the other, two Services. It is not suggested, however,that the Select Committee&apos;s recommendation should be further resisted on this ground: the point was fully explained to them before they took their decision.
Jurisdiction. The Navy have always had jurisdiction to try all. civil offences committed abroad, but have not had jurisdiction to try civil offences committed in this country outside ships, and naval establishments, &amp;c. The Army and theRoyal Air Force have long had jurisdiction to try all civil offences, except murder,treason, manslaughter, treason-felony and rape, wherever committed; and by thenew Army and Air Force Acts they have jurisdiction to try even those whencommitted outside the United Kingdom. The Select Committee have acceptedthe Admiralty&apos;s suggestion that naval jurisdiction should be the same as that ofthe other two Services. The Home Office have indicated that they will be readyto make an agreement with the Admiralty similar to that already existing withthe other two for determining in general which cases will be tried in the civil courts and which handed over to the Navy.Naval Offenders: Powers of Civil Authorities-The powers of the police to arrest naval deserters and other offenders, and the powers of civil courts to dealwith deserters and absentees who fall into their hands are at present to be foundin a number of different statutes. These matters constitute an important aspect of naval discipline, and it has been thought right to set them out in the naval discipline Act itself and in a form adhering as closely as possible to thecorresponding sections of the new Army and Air Force Acts. This should makeit easier for the police and the civil courts to administer them.Commonwealth Forces. The Naval Discipline (Dominion Naval Forces) Act,1911, provides for a community of discipline between the Royal Navy and such the Commonwealth Navies as apply the Naval Discipline Act to their forces;so, for example, that the officers of one Navy are eligible to sit on the courts-martialof the other. Although the Admiralty are anxious to preserve these arrangements with the only two Commonwealth countries who have not created a separatedisciplinary code of their own (Australia and New Zealand), the machinery ofthe Act of 1911 is unduly complicated. Moreover, since the community of discipline cannot in any case be preserved unless Australia and New Zealanddecide to adopt the new Act, there is no danger in repealing the Act of 1911 andsubstituting something simpler. Clause 114 of the draft Bill thus merely providesthat the Act shall apply to members of a Commonwealth force to such extent as may be provided by the Visiting Forces (British Commonwealth) Act, 1933 (to preserve existing arrangements with other Commonwealth countries, such asCanada), or by the law of the Commonwealth country (to preserve the existing arrangements with Australia and New Zealand): and that the necessary regulations governing the relations between the Royal Navy and the others may continue tobe made by Order in Council, but under the new Act instead of the Act of 1911.Interservice Attachment. Some years ago it was agreed that a servicemanattached to one of the other Services should become subject to the disciplinarysystem of that Service while remaining subject also to his own; and that the service under whose system the trial takes place should be responsible for the wholeproceedings, including confirmation (where uecessary), review and appeal. The newArmy and Air Force Acts were the first opportunity of giving effect to thisagreement and complementary changes were made in the Naval Discipline Act bythe Revision of the Army and Air Force Acts (Transitional Provisions) Act, 1955.These arrangements are preserved in this Bill.Fines for Officers. There are only two punishments for officers betweendismissal from the Service and a severe reprimand: dismissal from ship andforfeiture of seniority. Neither of these is very effective in dealing with temporary officers in war. Although an officer dismissed his ship remains on half pay until he is given another appointment, it is usually necessary to reappoint him at once in war so as to make use of his services; and forfeiture of seniority, though having an effect on an officers career, has a less serious effect on a temporary officer. Theexperience of two World Wars has led the Admiralty to think that it would be useful to be able to fine officers who commit offences in war too serious for a severereprimand and not serious enough for dismissal, from the Service. The pilcher committee recommended this and, although the War Office and the Air ministry have not seen fit to adopt a similar recommendation by the Lewis Committee, theSelect Committee have accepted it for the Navy. They have recommended thatfines not exceeding 30 days&apos; pay, should be available in peace as well as war to avoidwhat they regard as an implied slur on wartime officers. No such slur was intendedand indeed, since half pay is an ineffective penalty for regular officers in war, fineswould be useful in dealing with all officers in war.   Nevertheless, the Admiralty see
no objection to having power to fine officers in peace also, though they doubt if itwould be used so much in peace.Application of the Bill to Civilians. The North Atlantic Treaty OrganisationStatus of Forces Agreement (to which effect has been given in this country by the visiting Forces Act, 1952) enables the tribunals of the visiting force to try offencesby its nationals in the receiving State so long as they do not affect the security of,or the property or person of a member of, the receiving State. This jurisdictionextends not only to the Service members of the visiting force but also to the civiliancomponent. Similar arrangements exist with Japan and Libya. Advantage cannotbe taken of any of these arrangements unless there is some tribunal of the visitingforce that can deal with the offence. For this reason the new Army and AirForce Acts, with the agreement of the National Whitley Council, made those employed by or accompanying the armed forces (including the Navy) subject to military or air force law to a limited extent. It was always contemplated that those employed by or accompanying the naval forces should be dealt with under theNaval Discipline Act as soon as it could be amended; and the draft Bill containsprovisions closely corresponding with those of the Army and Air Force Acts.
