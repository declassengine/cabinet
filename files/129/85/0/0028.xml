CONFIDENTIALCOFY NO. \ JC.(57) 288th February, 1957CABINETFARM PRICE review memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and food we have to decide the line to be taken in discussion with the Farmers&apos;Unions during the annual review of the economic condition and prospects ofthe agricultural industry which is due to start on 13th February.     This hasbeen considered by the Ministerial Committee on the Farm Price Review,and I have been invited to submit to the Cabinet the issues for decision.There are differences of opinion between the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Agricultural ministers which we hope our colleagues will help usto resolve.The Minimum Award2.      The new long-term assurances require a minimum determinationsufficient to maintain the total value of the guarantees at not less than97&quot;! per cent of the total for the previous year, plus or minus cost increases or decreases that have occurred on review commodities sincethe last annual review.     There is a net cost increase of about  38 millionsif the effects of the special petrol and oil tax are included, and of about 33v millions if these are excluded.    Two-and-a-half per cent of thetotal value of the guarantees is about  3 0 millions.    The net result is aminimum determination of plus about  8 millions or plus about 3&quot;! millions, according to whether or not the special petrol and oil taxis included.The Petrol and Oil Tax3.      I feel that it is essential to allow the effects of the special tax on petrol and oil to be included for the purposes of the minimum determina-tion.    We have already stated that the higher cost of petrol and oil wouldbe considered at the price review.     There is no doubt that this is a costchange that has occurred in the sense provided for by the long-term assurances.     If the Government seek now to get round this in a way towhich the Farmers&apos; Unions will object, we shall be open to charges ofbreach of faith, we shall seriously prejudice the gain in confidence thatwe have obtained from these assurances, and we shall start the annual review off in an atmosphere of suspicion and recrimination.    the apparent gain of reducing the limit for our determination can be exaggerated.     I consider that a determination of plus  3^ millions wouldin fact be so low as to be indefensible in any event, whether we had thelong-term assurances or not.    The only possible way out, other thanallowing the special tax to count, would be in my opinion a firm statement
from the Government in the immediate future that the special tax will beremoved before the end of the&apos;annual review year1 on 31st May, but i recognise the difficulty of such a solution.    The right way of dealingwith this item of costs, I-consider, is to include it for the purposes of arriving at the minimum determination, but to give it little or no weightin the ultimate settlement.4.      The Chancellor of the Exchequer on the other hand feels that it iswell known that the special tax is temporary;  that it is essential to getthe lower limit under the long-term assurances down to as low a figureas possible;  and that the farmers ought not to be able to accuse us of a breach of faith if they were told that the Government were assuming thatthe tax would be removed before the end of May, with if necessary an offer of compensation should that assumption not be realised in fact.But any compensation would have to be under some new and special arrangement which would, I fear, only lead us into other difficulties.The farmers would certainly not accept anything less than recompense ata special review and this, for so small an amount, would jeopardise thewhole of our new arrangements intended to get rid of special reviews.5.      In my opinion it is simply not worth while running the risk of charges of breach of faith on this issue.Total Value of the Guarantees6.      Whatever the lower limit, we cannot agree on the alteration in thetotal value of the guarantees that should be our objective.    The Chancellorthinks it ought to be the lowest that the long-term assurances permit;whereas I think it should be above the plus  8 millions that I would regard as the permissible lower limit.7.      The main arguments for a determination at or very close to theminimum are:-(i)    The general national economic situation requires a strictattitude to be taken to the claims of agriculture as ofother sectors of the economy.(ii)    Exchequer liability is still high and may increase -about  225 millions in 1956-57 and, on present estimates at the existing level of guarantees, about 240 millions in 1957-58.(iii) The forecast net income of the industry under normal weather conditions ( 334 millions) shows a recovery in 1956-57 to a level equivalent to that of the peakprevious year of 1952-53.(iv) The long-term arrangements recently made by theGovernment and welcomed by the farmers representa substantial limitation on the Governments freedomof action at annual reviews;   it should be possible totake full advantage of these, particularly in a year offinancial stringency.
(v)    Production of important commodities, particularly milk and eggs, is outstripping demand at present prices, and prospects generally are for a weakening of market prices.(vi)    Home agricultural production is prejudicing importsfrom other countries, particularly the Commonwealth,by reducing markets or prices.(vii)    Of the full cost increase for review commodities sincethe last annual review of  38 millions it can be argued that some  15 millions (including the  4^ millions forthe petrol tax) could be discounted because it is eitherlikely to be temporary or has already been carried inthe net income of the industry without serious adverseresults, and that a further  15 millions should be takencare of by the increasing efficiency of the industry,leaving about only  8 millions that should be seriously considered as an amount to be covered by an increase inthe guarantees.8. The main arguments for a determination at a rather higher levelare:-(i)    There is a continuing heavy burden of cost increases;  theseare real and may reduce the net income of the industryif the farmers have to carry the full burden.    some allowance should be made for the increasing efficiency of the industry, but there is substantial disagreement with the Unions about how much this is worth, and inpractice it will be difficult to justify the Governmenttaking as much as  15 millions.    The cost increase of 38 millions should not be discounted by anything likethe  30 millions stated in argument (vii) in paragraph above.(ii)    Although net income under normal weather conditionsmay be forecast at a satisfactory level, the actual net income expected to be received by the industry in1956-57 is forecast at less ( 317 millions) than in theprevious year (  325 millions) and substantially belowthe forecast for normal weather conditions( 334 millions).     It has only been lower in one yearduring the last six years and this was in the very badyear of 1954-55.(iii)    At the last annual review circumstances were not dis-similar, in particular there was a  37 millions cost increase and a difficult national economic situation,and yet the final award was to increase the value ofthe guarantees by  25 millions;  moreover, although this appeared to the Government to be fair and just,it was hotly disputed by the industry as insufficientand was part of an imposed settlement.
(iv)    The trend of net income over the last five years or so is relatively stable, although profits in many other sectors of the economy have been rising.    This has meant notonly a lower real income but also insufficient resources to enable technical improvements to be exploited,particularly by the small farmer.(v)    The new long-term arrangements were not intended to do more than set a floor to the amount of the award and full account of all other relevant factors was promisedat annual reviews;   if farmers&apos; confidence in the workingof the new arrangements is to be maintained it isessential in the first year to demonstrate that, if other relevant factors point to a higher determination, theactual award can in fact be appreciably above theminimum figure;   otherwise a large part of the gain from the long-term assurances will certainly be lost .Views of the Farmers1 Unions9.      The Farmers&apos; Unions will expect at least the plus  25 millions whichthey got last year.    They will not admit any case for discounting part of thecost increase, except possibly the special petrol and oil tax for the purposesof the determination (though not of the minimum).    They will press for alarger share of increasing efficiency.     They will also want some furtherallowance to be made for improving the resources of the industry and its contribution to the balance of payments.Commodities10.     On the basis of arrangements arising out of the long-term assurances we expect to start with a credit of  3^; millions for increases in the crop price guarantees for the 1957 harvest determined at the1956 annual review, though the Farmers1 Unions may press that thisshould be additional to any total determination that might otherwise bejustified.11.     If the objective is to start with a schedule adding up to plus 3-1 millions, something on the lines of that given in the Appendix designedto make as few changes as possible would perhaps be the least difficultto defend.     But it could not be reconciled with our agricultural policy -and it might well create embarrassment with the Commonwealth.12.     We have not reached agreement on the distribution of any higheramount and we would wish to consider this further in the light of the cabinet&apos;s conclusions on the total that should be our objective.    But Ithink our general aim should be to reduce the guarantee on eggs;  to make no change in the guarantee on milk, despite a substantial cost increase;to keep profitability more or less stable on most other products, exceptthat we should be prepared to increase profitability somewhat on sheep,barley and oats.    A rather greater increase in the subsidy on nitrogenwould also be desirable.
13.    The major difficulties in regard to commodities will arise on milk and eggs.     Production of both of these has increased substantially this yearwithout any parallel increase in consumption.     Unfortunately, these areproducts of major interest to the smaller farmers and there will be extremely strong resistance to any reduction in their profitability.Tactics14. . Any award at or near the minimum would certainly have to be imposed upon the farmers.     If, as the Chancellor wishes, we were to start and end at the minimum, I think we ought,to make this plain to theFarmers1 Unions at the outset.     We should no- doubt be told that we wereruling out consideration of all the relevant factors, which we have alwaysexamined with the Unions as an essential part of annual reviews.    but after a major row we might cause rather less resentment in the end than we should by making an apparent show of going through all the manyfactors involved, only to come back to the starting point.15.    If on the other hand we are prepared to consider a settlementabove the minimum, it would be very desirable that the starting point forofficials1 discussions with the Unions should be within, say,  5-8 millions of the point at which we expect that they may be able to end.     The general expectation in the farming industry at least is that the new long-term assurances will have reduced the scope for &quot;haggling&quot; at annual reviews.That was one of our own major objectives.     We can only get anywherenear such a result if we have a start that is &quot;realistic&quot; in terms of where we expect to end.Conclusion16.    I am firmly convinced that, after giving full weight to all thearguments of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a fair settlement - even inthe present atmosphere of financial stringency - will require an increasesubstantially above the minimum.17.    The farmers&apos; leaders and our own Members in expounding thelong-term assurances in accordance with our White Paper have emphasised that the minimum is a floor only and that the actual determina-tions will as hitherto be made at the price review each year after consideration of all relevant factors.18.    In objective global terms there is obviously much force in theChancellor&apos;s arguments.     But the individual farmer will think in termsof his own position.    He is acutely conscious of his seriously increasingcosts, mostly outside his own control, and in the majority of cases ofhis decreased income.    To have such a minimal contribution to increased costs as would be involved in a global increase of only 3^ millions out of  38 millions or more will seem to him sheerinjustice.    There will be extreme and widespread resentment.    Nor inmy opinion shall v/e be able to count on the support of our own members to fight our battle.19.    It is my judgment that if we insist on imposing a settlement thisyear based on the minimum provided for under the long-term assuranceswe shall destroy at one blow the industry&apos;s confidence in our intentions
and shall lose the goodwill that we have so painfully and with such difficultyacquired.     Nor could we hope to re-acquire it within the next few years.I urge my colleagues to ponder carefully before doing this.Foints for Decision by Ministers20.    I understand that the Home Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland are in general agreement with the views I have expressedabove.    On behalf of the Ministerial Committee on the Farm price review, I invite the-Cabinet, to decide:-(i)    whether the special tax on petrol and oil should or should not be counted for the purpose of calculating the mini::;-.award required by the long-term assurances;(ii)    on the basis of what changes in the total value of theguarantee-s officials should be authorised to start the discussions with the Farmers&apos; Unions.D.H.A.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and food, S.
