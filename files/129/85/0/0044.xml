secret.(57) 44COPY NO.27th February, 1957CABINETMIL FORD HAVENMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and civil AviationWe must have at least one port in the South of England capable of handling the new super tankers of up to 100,000 tons.    Milford Haven isthe only natural harbour here which can readily be developed for thispurpose.2.      On 18th February the Home Affairs Committee agreed, subject tothe approval of the Cabinet, that I should be authorised to put in hand thepreparation of a Bill for introduction in the next Parliamentary session to establish a Conservancy Authority for Milford Haven (H. A. (57) 4thMeeting, Item 2).3.      I therefore ask for approval to proceed as quickly as possible withpreparing the Bill and with considering how the Conservancy authority should be constituted.    In the meantime I have to take account of currentdevelopments.    Three Private Bills affecting navigation in the Haven arebeing promoted in this session of Parliament.    There is naturally verygreat interest locally in the rapid development of the port not only for thedischarge of tankers but for repairing large tankers and the dischargeof iron ore.     60,000 ton tankers have already been ordered to bring oil to this country and schemes for receiving vessels of this size are in handor under examination for the Thames, Southampton Water, the Mersey andthe Clyde.    No project likely to arise will, however, diminish the greatimportance of Milford Haven, where facilities are proposed which willenable tankers of up to 100,000 tons to be handled.     Its orderly develop-ment to handle greatly increased traffic makes it essential to establish aConservancy Authority with power to exercise general control.    This will involve no Government expenditure and authorities with similar powersexist in the Southampton Harbour Board, the Forth Conservancy Board,the Tyne Improvement Commission, etc.4.      I have already had to set up an ad hoc Committee to sort outimmediate problems and I hope this will be able to hold the position untillegislation can be passed.    I hope, however, that a place can be found for this Bill very early in the new session as otherwise the Governmentmay well be critiaed for not pressing forward as vigorously as possible with the development of facilities for the discharge and repair of gianttankers.H.W.Ministry of Transport and CivilAviation, W. 1.26th February, 1957.
