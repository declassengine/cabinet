secret.(57) 47 COPY NO. JpLZ7th February, 1957CABINETPUBLIC SERVICE SALARIESMem or andum by the Minister of Pensionsand National insurance do not oppose the improvements in public service salariesrecommended in the Chancellor of the Exchequers paper C(57) 42.Most of them are, in my opinion, if anything overdue.   I agree alsothat we shall never achieve an ideal time for these salary changes.2.       I feel bound9   however, to warn my colleagues of the repercussions on social service benefits generally of an announcement of this kind inpresent circumstances.3.       I set out in paragraphs 6 to 11 of my paper C.(57) 36 the serious and growing pressure on the main rates of National Insurance benefits and, in particular, on retirement pensions.   This pressure has grownsince I circulated C(57) 36.   The Opposition in Parliament have committed themselves to support some immediate increase in national insurance and National Assistance benefits.   The flow of petitions anddemonstrations continues.   It seems to me clear that increases of this sort, particularly in connection with Ministers and Members ofParliament, must intensify the pressure, though the precise extent towhich they will do this is a mstter of judgment.4.       I ought also to point out that mid-March, the proposed time forthe general announcement, will coincide with the publication of the index of Retail Prices figure for mid-February.   If, as may be the case, this figure shows an increase, the position on the main National insurance benefits will become noticeably worse.    On National Assistance, anysuch increase would be likely to be decisive, but it would be so, Ithink, in any event, irrespective of any announcement on public servicesalaries.5.       My colleagues will, I think, wish to consider the timing of any announcement on public service salaries in the context of the agreeddesirability of deferring, if possible, action on National insurance benefits until next Session.J.A.B.-C.Ministry of Pensions and national Insurance, W.C.2.
