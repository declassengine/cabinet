OXFORD ROADSMemorandum by the Minister of housing and Local Government and Ministerfor Welsh AffairsThe following motion by Lord Beveridge is to be discussed in theHouse of Lords on 13th February -&quot;To call attention to the widespread uneasiness feltat the inability of the city and university of Oxford and theMinistry of Housing and Local Government to agree on a plan which can both preserve the amenities of Oxford, andsatisfy the community&apos;s need for adequate communications and services, to emphasize the danger of piecemeal actiondirected to one or other aspect of a many sided problem andto move to resolve that  &apos;in the opinion  of this House theproblem as a whole should be referred to a Royal Commissioninstructed after taking evidence to report within six months&apos;time, and Her Majesty&apos;s Government should hold up meanwhileany action that might prejudice the Report of the Commission&apos;.&quot;2.      The motion is in fairly general terms, but without doubtLord Beveridge has mainly in mind the question of a road acrossChrist Church Meadow.3.      I think my colleagues may like to be reminded of the presentposition about the Oxford road problem, which is not clearly understood by all members of the public.4..     In November 1955 the Oxford City Council put forward proposalsfor inner relief roads as an amendment to their Development Plan.   Theseproposals were the subject of a public inquiry.    In September last my predecessor with the approval of the Cabinet (CM.(56) 52nd Conclusions,Minute 5) rejected them, on the grounds that they provided neither asolution of the traffic porblem nor an acceptable compromise.   He wenton to ask the Council to submit fresh proposals for a new inner by-passroad which would cross the northern side of Christ Church Meadow,curve through St. Ebbe&apos;s and continue northwards to a new junction withSt. Giles.COPY NO. 5 OSECRETC.(57) 258th February, 1957CABINET
5.      I am now waiting for the Oxford City Council to submit their proposals.   I should have to consider whether I should intervene if itappeared that the Council were going to do nothing, but that situation hasnot yet arisen, and I do not think it will.6.      If the City Council submit proposals for a Meadow road, theywould have to be the subject of a further public inquiry; and not till after that can a final decision be given.   At the inquiry, for the first time, thearguments for and against such a road would be publicly deployed.Evidence and opinion could be given about the traffic need:  about theextent of the contribution likely to be made by the Completion of the outer by-passes and the development of a shopping centre at Cowley:about the question whether a road through the Meadow would meet the traffic need as no other solution could do:  and about the question whethereven if that should be established, the price to be paid would be too high.7.      It will ultimately be for the Government to judge where the publicinterest lies and to resolve these questions accordingly.   Tt seems to methat to abandon the proper statutory procedure at this stage and to set upa Royal Commission or other body of inquiry would be quite out of place.The matter is for the time being in the hands of the City Council, andthe procedure which is being followed is in accordance with the provision made by Parliament for determining a question of this kind.   It ensuresthat details of an actual proposal will have to be made public, and thatall those interested will be given a full opportunity of expressing theirviews, before any decision is taken.   I cannot see on what grounds I,or the Government as a whole, could rightly retreat from the position ofupholding that this statutory procedure is appropriate and adequate; andto change our position at this point by setting up a Royal commission would be a retreat.8.      If it is suggested that, because the subject of the inquiry arisesout of a request from the Minister, it would be desirable that it should beheld by an Inspector who was not a Government official, and whosereport could be published (e. g. as in the case of Gatwick Airport). Iwould not oppose that.9.      I am certain that there is a great deal of misunderstanding aboutthe present position.   I recommend that the Government spokesman inthe House of Lords should explain exactly how matters stand, emphasizingthat the pros and cons of a road through the Meadow have never yet beenthe subject of a public inquiry:  that although the Government haveexpressed a provisional view, that view is still open to challenge: andthat there is no question of any final decision being come to until therehas been the fullest examination of any proposal which the City council may now submit, and of the objections made against it.   It would be inappropriate for him to attempt to discuss the case for (or against) aMeadow road, because that must wait until it becomes known exactly whatthe City Council propose.   What is at issue now, on Lord Eeveridge&apos;motion, is the question of the procedure.10.        In the debate it may be asked what would happen if, at the public inquiry, the factual evidence about traffic was not adequate to enable adecision to be reached.   In reply an assurance could certainly be given that, in consultation with the Minister of Transport, I will obtain anyfurther information or advice on this aspect of the Oxford problem whichmay be necessary, before a final decision is reached.H.B.Ministry of Housing andLocal Government, S.W.I.7th February, 1957
The attached will be taken under Item 4of the Cabinefs agenda at the meeting to be heldon 7th February, 1957 at 11. 3o a.m.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.6th February, 1957
