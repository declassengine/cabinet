cabinet national service note by the Lord President of the council I circulate for the consideration of my colleagues a report by a Committee ofMinisters on future policy on National Service.S.Privy Council Office, S.W. I,11th January, 1957.51042&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; C*trrPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1957SECRET Copy No.  28C. (57) 115th January, 1957
REPORT BY THE COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL service the Defence Committee invited us to prepare recommendations on the futureof National Service, mainly with a view to what might be included in theforthcoming Annual Statement on Defence on this subject. The Policy review committee have approved a rundown of the active Forces to a figure of 450,000male all-ranks by 1st April, 1961. The adult male other rank content of this total would be about 390,000, and our discussions have turned mainly on how this requirement of 390,000 can be met. The Minister of Defence has informed us that ithe latest estimate-based on the report of a Working Party sponsored by theCentral Statistical Office of the number of male regular other ranks we might expect to obtain for the Forces in the 1960&apos;s, is between 311,000 and 387,000; thissomewhat wide bracket depends on whether a conservative or an optimistic view is taken of the possibilities of regular recruiting in the long term, if National service were abolished. He pointed out, however, that this strength would probably not be reached until two or three years after the effective date, 1st April, 1961, setfor the rundown of the Forces, since it will take time for the regular componentsof the Services to be built up on the basis of the longer regular engagementsintroduced with the new Pay Code in April 1956.2. During the process of rapid rundown of the Forces in the coming fouryears, the National Service content will progressively and rapidly contract. Wecould effect this reduction in the National Service intake by continuing the present policy, set out in the White Paper of October 1955 (Cmd. 9608), of having fewerregistrations and allowing the call-up age to rise progressively: it is nowapproaching 18 years 9 months and would rise to about 21 years by 1961. But, inour view, this policy could only be continued if the Government announced aterminal date for National Service, related to the expiry of the present NationalService Act. The power to call up young men of 18 terminates under that Act on31st December, 1958. There will at that date still be a considerable backlog ofmen liable for service, owing to previous deferment and the rising age of call-up;but the numbers thus available are unlikely to meet the required National Serviceintakes into the Forces after about 1961.3. The question whether National Service in the Armed Forces can be dispensed with after 1961 turns primarily on the estimate of regular recruiting inthe early 1960&apos;s. The bracket within which such estimates may lie has been indicated in paragraph 1 above. It is the considered view of the Minister ofDefence and his Service colleagues that our Forces cannot be allowed to fall belowthe eventual target figure of 450,000 (that is, 390,000 male adult other ranks).He considers that because our national security is directly involved a conservative view must be taken of the possibilities of regular recruiting in theearly 1960&apos;s, and that we should not assume more than 320,000 regular other ranks being available: this would leave a gap of 70,000 men to be provided forthe active Forces through National Service, in order to make up the total of390,000 male other ranks. With the exception of the Minister of Labour, theCommittee accept the view of the Minister of Defence. The Minister of Labourfeels that if every possible effort, including financial incentives, improvements in conditions of service, increased recruiting publicity, &amp;c, were adopted to boostregular recruiting, it would be justifiable to assume a regular recruiting figure whichwould enable all-regular Forces much nearer the mid-way point of the bracket tobe maintained: and if all-regular Forces of the order of 350,000 or more could bemaintained, he thinks that it would be difficult to justify continuing any systemof National Service designed to bridge the remaining small margin. He points out,too, that irt the early 1960&apos;s, we shall be feeling the full effect of the birth rate&quot; bulge &quot; (already a matter of preoccupation in educational planning), and thatthis automatic enlargement of the potential recruitable field should of itselfappreciably reduce the gap.4.1 We have accordingly examined the effect on the Services, and also on manpower for Civil Defence, of ending National Service in the Armed Forces.5. The Army, which takes much the major proportion of the NationalService intake each year, would naturally be the most affected if National service were abolished. The Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force would be less affected,though the available sources of building up reserves in the Royal Navy would be seriously impaired.   The Home Secretary pointed out that the cessation of the
manpower contribution from the Army and R.A.F., for the very important firefighting and heavy rescue work of Civil Defence, through National Servicereservists, would deal a serious blow at the whole organisation of civil defencemanpower for an emergency. The majority of the Committee accept the viewthat it would constitute an unjustifiable risk in the Defence field were theGovernment now to announce a terminal date for National Service. . Any suchannouncement would also need careful consideration from the standpoint of its effects on NATO.6. In whatever form National Service in the Armed Forces may have tocontinue, it will presumably be necessary for the Government to announce in the queen&apos;s Speech next autumn its intentions about the National Service Acts expiringat the end of 1958. It is, moreover, the view of the Committee that, in the context of the announced rundown of the Forces by 1961 in the forthcoming defence white Paper, it will be difficult to avoid a statement of the Government^ intentionswith regard to the future of National Service in the White Paper. We have therefore examined what form of National Service might be adopted to meet theposition where a relatively small intake annually of National Servicemen is requiredin the Forces each year.7. Previously we had suggested that a plan put forward by the Minister ofLabour might offer a way out of the present difficulty. This plan, in broad terms,would mean exempting from National Service men deferred to completeapprenticeship, higher education, &amp;c, through lowering by administrative action,the age of call-up to 20^ years or 21 years. This proposal has been very carefully examined; but the conclusion, which the Minister of Labour himself endorses, isthat his plan could not be adapted to cope with yearly intakes of less than about75,000 without involving &quot; blanket&quot; deferments in industry which he thinksimpracticable. It is clear that some severely selective scheme will have to beadopted to produce the very much smaller annual intakes of National Servicemen;and the problem is exaggerated by the effects of the birth rate bulge referred toabove. Despite its obvious political drawbacks and the inequity of its incidence,we see no practical alternative to adopting a form of ballot, although perhapsonly one of every six or seven names which &quot; go into the hat&quot; would be needed for full-time service. The Minister of Labour is doubtful whether public opinionwill accept the idea of a ballot in such circumstances. The majority of theCommittee consider that those men who, through the operation of the ballot,are required to do two years&apos; service in the Forces and any lesser period of full-time service will carry with it serious military disadvantages and involvedisproportionate overheads in training, movements, &amp;c. should probably not berequired to undertake any liabilities of part-time service after their full-time service is over. This presents its own problems which need to be worked out in some detail. If a ballot for National Service is approved, the Home Secretary wouldlike to consider using it to produce manpower for the more important civil defence services. Such men might do, say, three months full-time service, plus a reservetraining liability.8. While the general view of the Committee is that the ballot will have to bethe main method of producing the reduced National Service intakes, they suggestthat, at the same time, consideration should be given to raising medical standards and allowing more generous standards of compassionate release, although these can only make a minor contribution towards solving the present problem.9.   Our conclusions may be broadly stated as follows:  (1) National Service in the Armed Forces should not be regarded as apermanent and essential factor in building up the active Forces of thiscountry in the long term: the aim should be to produce all-regular forces, and every possible method,, by way of incentives and improvements in conditions of service, should be adopted towards thisend.(2) For some years to come, however, and at least until about 1965, a NationalService intake of relatively small, and probably progressively smaller,numbers will be necessary for the Forces, and there is no practical alternative to providing this through a ballot. This should be combined with a policy of broadening the field of exemptions from NationalService through raising medical standards, more compassionateexemptions, &amp;c.
-C7010th January, 1957.The; Minister; of Labour accepts the first of the above conclusions, but not thesecond, since he feels that the gap in the approved total of. the active Forces whichNational Service will probably be called upon to fill is likely to become so smallas to make a continuance of National Service, even on a severely selective basis,impracticable. - .&apos; ; If the Cabinet approve these recommendations, we suggest that their general sense should be incorporated in the forthcoming Annual Statement on defence as the approved policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to the future ofNational Service.Initialled on behalf of the Committee.
