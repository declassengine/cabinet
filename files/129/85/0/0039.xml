(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(57) 39 COPY NO. hO16th February, 1957CABINETOIL SUPPLIES:  GOODS AND PUBLIC SERVICE VEHICLESMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and civil aviation the present rationing period for goods and public servicevehicles ends on 7th April.   I agree with the Minister of Power thatrationing must continue beyond that date and arrangements must there-fore be made at once for a second period,2.       Regional Transport Commissioners must begin to distributeapplication forms not later than 21st February so that the forms may bereturned in time to allow at least four weeks for assessing rations and distributing coupons.3.       We can dispense with the basic ration for goods vehicles (therehas been no basic ration for public service vehicles during the presentperiod).   Regional Transport Commissioners have now acquired consi-considerable   knowledge of operators&apos; requirements and I therefore proposeto abandon the system of basic and supplementary rations for the secondperiod and,  generally speaking, to relate issues to the total amountsoperators received in basic and supplementary rations during the first period.   I also propose that coupons should be issued for two months ata time instead of one month.4.       For the second period the pattern of demand will change becauseat the commencement of rationing many operators held substantial stocks which will now have been used, and consumption, for example in thebuilding and civil engineering industry, will be significantly different inthe spring and summer from what it is in winter.   On the passenger sidethere is the particular problem of operators of express services andexcursions and tours who are at present cut to half their normal winterconsumption.   This work is the mainstay of many operators and they mustbe helped, not only for their own sakes but to avoid serious hardship tothe public and to many resorts which depend to a considerable extent oncoach traffic.   To help to meet all these changes in demand the Ministerof Power has been good enough to make available 35,000 tons of dervover and above the amount set aside for the road transport industry inthe first period.   I have a substantial reserve of petrol most of which Iexpect to be able to carry over into the next period and I therefore think we shall be able to manage with the same allocation of petrol as for thefirst period.
5.       It is essential that an announcement about the administrative arrangements for the next period should be made not later than20th February and I seek the agreement of my colleagues.H.W.Ministry of Transport and civil Aviation, W. 1.15th February, 19571
