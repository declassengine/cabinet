The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No,C.(57) 419th January, 1957CABINETCYPRUSMemorandum by the Minister of State for Colonial affairs as the Colonial Secretary stated in Parliament on19th December, two officials were sent to Seychelles, at the time of publication of Lord Radcliffe&apos;s constitutional proposals for Cyprus, togive explanations about these proposals to Archbishop Makarios.2. After one postponement, these officials left Seychelles on13th January, and are on their way back to London.     When they left,the following notice was put out to the Press:-&quot;It isannounced by the Colonial office that Mr. D. L. Pearson and Mr. C. Tornaritis, thetwo officials who arrived in Seychelles oh 21st Decemberin order to be available to explain Lord Radcliffe&apos;sReport to Archbishop Makarios, left Seychellestoday by ship en route to London via Bombay whencethey will fly to England.    They wiU report to theSecretary of State for the Colonies on their return&quot;.There has been speculation in the Press, especially in Athens and cyprus, that Makarios might be released, or transferred, perhaps to malta.    When Parliament reassembles interest will be shown in the talks in Seychelles and two relevant questions have already been putdown for reply on Wednesday, 23rd January.     The Governor has suggested that a full factual statement should be put out, at or soon after the time when the officials left;  and I have no doubt that we should issue a statement as soon as possible.3. Appendix A to this paper contains the draft of a fullexplanatory statement, prepared in the form of a Press release.Appendix B contains the draft of a shorter statement, in the form ofa Pveply to a Parliamentary Question.4. The Governor is prepared to agree to the text in appendix a as a Press Statement, although he feels that it lets Makarios down toolightly.    He urges that it should  (if used) be followed by a further statement by Her Majesty&apos;s Government on their attitude towardsMakarios.5. The text in Appendix B appears to be too long to serve as an oral Reply, but it would be difficult in a shorter Answer to conveyaccurately the outcome of the talks with Makarios.6. The Prime M;nister has asked that this matter should bebrought before the Cabinet.P.Colonial Office, S.W-.1.18th January, 1957.
APPENDIX a text FOR RELEASE TO press in response to questions that have been asked about the departure from Seychelles of the two officials who have been explaining to Archbishop Makarios Lord Radcliffe&apos;s constitutional proposals forCyprus, the Colonial Office have issued the following statement:-2. As was announced in Parliament on 19th December, itwas arranged for Lord Radcliffe&apos;s Secretary, Mr. D.L. Pearson, andMr. C. Tornaritis of the Cyprus Government, to be in Seychelles,so as to be available to explain Lord Radcliffe&apos;s constitutional proposals to Archbishop Makarios.3. It was arranged also for them to have a Greek translation of the Report with them;   and the intention was that Archbishop Makariosshould not only be enabled to study the Report on publication, but shouldhave the opportunity of asking for elucidation of any of the proposalswhich either for translation or any other reason were not clear to him.Any observations he wished to make on the proposals for a newconstitution would have been immediately transmitted to the colonial secretary and the Governor, and would have been studied together withcomments from any other sources.4. As it was realised that the Archbishop might maintain thatit was difficult for him to form decided views on complex constitutional proposals of such importance without further consultation, it was statedthat facilities would be provided for a representative party of Cypriotsto go to Seychelles for such consultation.     It was also stated that similar arrangements would be made for someone from Greece to visitSeychelles and consult Archbishop Makarios should that be desired.5. Mr. Pearson and Mr. Tornaritis called on Archbishop Makarios on the day of their arrival in Seychelles, and explained thepurpose and scope of their visit.    The Archbishop informed them thatthe Radcliffe Report was clear, and that he understood it.6. With regard to the suggestion that persons might comefrom Cyprus and Greece for consultations with him, he said that he wasnot willing to enter into any discussions in an  atmosphere of detention.7. The officials had made it clear to the Archbishop that theywere not empowered to discuss any matters outside the scope of theirmission as announced.    However, when he indicated in informalconversation that his immediate concern was terminating the state of violence in Cyprus, they asked him whether it was his intention to makea statement to that effect.    His answer was that he was not disposed under present conditions to discuss any question relative to the future of cyprus:  that in any event he genuinely desired irrespective of any settlement of the political question to see Cyprus return to peace;that he sincerely believed that his return to and. presence in Cypruswould constitute the main factor for the successful restitution of peace in Cyprus;   and that he would like the way in which peace should be restored to be left to him.8. He was asked to say whether he would make a statementindicating that it would be advantageous if an atmosphere of tranquillity
prevailed in Cyprus while the constitutional proposals  were  underconsideration.    He was also asked what kind of statement or other action he would consider appropriate;  and was reminded that arenunciation of violence by him would create a new situation.     All heindicated was that he could not begin making any pacifying move solong as he was detained in Seychelles or elsewhere.9. In the circumstances it seemed that no useful purpose would be served by prolonging the stay of the officials in Seychelles.They accordingly left on the 13th January.10. The Government regret that Archbishop Makarios has notyet given any practical proof of his expressed anxiety about the presentsituation in Cyprus, either by using his influence to bring violence toan end or by making helpful comment on Lord Radcliffe&apos;s constitutional proposals.    Thus he cannot avoid responsibility for holding back thepolitical advance of the people of Cyprus.11. The Governments offer of a new constitution on the lines recommended by Lord Radcliffe remains open and they will continueto work strenuously to create the conditions in v/hich that constitutioncan be launched and successfully worked.APPENDIX BTEXT FOR USE IN REPLY TO A PARLIAMENTARYQUESTIONC.
