Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1957SECRET Copy No.   52C. (57) 4325th February, 1957CABINETNUCLEAR POWER programme memorandum by the Minister of power seek the authority of my colleagues for a statement on the revision of the nuclear power programme. I attach (Appendix A) a draft of the statement that Iwould like to make in the House of Lords concurrently with a similar statement by the Paymaster-General in the House of Commons.2. Since the publication of the White Paper of February 1955 (Cmd. 9389), ithas become a matter of common knowledge that technical progress during thetwo years that have passed has rendered out of date the estimates which it containedand that the way is open for a considerable acceleration of the programme. Anofficial Working Party which included representatives of the Atomic energy authority and the English and Scottish Electricity Authorities have now concludedtheir examination of the problems involved in such an acceleration. Their report is attached to this memorandum. I have discussed its contents with Lord Citrineand his colleagues on the Central Electricity Authority and with Sir EdwinPlowden, the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Authority, and secured their agreement to the policy outlined in my draft statement. I have also had discussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.3. The 1955 White Paper envisaged that work might begin on the first twocivil nuclear stations about mid-1957; that these stations might each have a net output capacity of between 100 and 200 MW.; and that by the end of 1965 we might hope to have some 1,500-2,000 MW. of civil nuclear capacity in operation.4. Progress in fact has been considerably more rapid. Before Christmas theCentral Electricity Authority had been able to place contracts for their first twostations (Bradwell in Essex and Berkeley in Gloucestershire) each with an output capacity of about 300 MW. or 50 per cent, greater than the maximum capacityoriginally estimated for the earlier stations. By the end of the present year work should have started on two further stations of similar capacity, one in the south ofEngland and one in the south of Scotland (the provisional sites chosen for these stations are Harikley Point in Somerset and Hunterston in Ayrshire but both arestill subject to planning procedure). Moreover the Atomic Energy Authority&apos;sstation at Calder Hall for the production of fissile material for military purposeshas now been in operation for four months and gives us reason to hope that thefirst civil nuclear stations which are fundamentally similar in design will provethoroughly efficient in operation.5. The earlier nuclear stations are very costly to construct. Bradwell andBerkeley (if the cost of their initial fuel charges is taken into account) will costthree and a half times as much as a conventional coal-burning station of similarcapacity. Technical progress is expected to bring about a rapid decrease in thesecapital costs. Meanwhile running costs (excluding capital charges) are under halfthe costs of conventional power stations. x\51248b
6. I am advised by the Atomic Energy Authority that, in the light of thetechnical progress that has been achieved since February 1955, it would now be reasonable to plan for a nuclear capacity of 6,000 MW. in operation by the end of1965, instead of the 1,500-2,000 MW. mentioned in the White Paper,7. The Electricity Authorities are planning for a total electricity output capacity of 51,000 MW. by 1970 as against the present capacity of nearly 22,000MW. By 1970, it would be hoped that of the total capacity 12,000 MW. wouldbe nuclear power.8. The inclusion of the first instalment of 6,000 MW. of nuclear power by1965 would involve the Authority in an extra cost of  770 millions in addition to 2,580 millions which would have been the cost had the whole installation to this date been conventional oil or coal-burning plant.9. 6,000 MW. of nuclear power would involve the commissioning of nineteennuclear stations on sixteen different sites before the end of 1965. It would save the equivalent of 18 million tons of coal in a full year&apos;s operation.10.   The main arguments in favour of such a programme are:  (i) The increasing gravity of our energy situation. Estimates agreed by myMinistry and the Treasury suggest that whatever measures we may take in the meantime, we are likely to require nearly twice as muchimported oil in 1970 as we are consuming to-day. The net cost of importing energy is likely to grow from  250 millions in 1955 to  450millions in 1970. It is imperative that we should do everything possibleto slow down the rate at which this energy gap is widening, and to startto reduce it at the earliest possible moment by the use of nuclear energy.(ii) The increased security which a nuclear programme offers to the economywhen compared to dependence on the availability of growing quantitiesof oil or coal from abroad.(iii) The need to maintain the impetus of our own nuclear programme if weare to take full advantage of our opportunities in the export market.11. I am, however, impressed by the possibility of slippages in the executionof the programme and by the danger that the capital costs of the nuclear stationswill not fall quite as rapidly as we may hope. Moreover, a programme of this scale will involve a heavily increased investment load in the early 1960s and willat that time pose formidable physical and financial problems, I propose therefore that we should take advantage of the fact that a final decision on the amount of nuclear capacity to be commissioned by the end of 1965 need not be taken forperhaps 18 months or two years, and announce our present decision to adopt a range of 5,000-6,000 MW. by that date as our target for planning purposes. Thiswould mean making all our immediate plans, e.g., for the supply of uranium andother material required, for the acquisition of sites, and for the planning of the transmission network, on a scale sufficient to accommodate a 6,000 MW.programme. On the other hand, if experience showed the need for the lowerprogramme, we should not be committed publicly and would be retaining freedomof action..12. I also seek the agreement of my colleagues to introducing into the currentElectricity Bill a number of clauses amending the existing procedure in regard to securing planning consent for electric power stations and overhead lines. Thereasons for this request are set out in paras. 27-31 of the Working Party&apos;s report and a note on the proposed amendments is attached as Appendix B to thismemorandum. I realise that legislation designed to eliminate some of the existingopportunities for delaying action in planning procedure will not be popular. but even with conventional generating stations the delays caused by the existingprocedure are beginning to represent, serious handicaps to progress and these riskswill be greatly increased with a nuclear programme. I believe that someamendment to the existing law would in any case become inevitable within thenext few years and that the announcement of an important nuclear programmeoffers us the best opportunity of securing it with the assent of public opinion.&apos;,.        .&apos;&apos; ,&apos;     .        .. &apos;--;;-\.:. &apos;       - m.Ministry of Power, S.W.1.22nd February, 1957.
Appendix ADRAFT GOVERNMENT STATEMENT ON THE NUCLEAR POWERPROGRAMMEThe Government, in conjunction with the English and Scottish electricity authorities and the Atomic Energy Authority, have now completed theirre-examination of the programme outlined in the White Paper of February 1955,which set a target of some 1,500-2,000 MW. of nuclear capacity in operation in thecountry by the end of 1965. Since we already spend some  250 million net perannum on importing fuel and this burden on our balance of payments will growinevitably during the next decade, the importance of our need to develop nuclear power as a source of energy cannot be in doubt. Our task has therefore been toconsider the extent to which the 1955 programme can be accelerated in the light of technical advances within the last two years.2. It is the considered opinion of our expert advisers that in the light of present knowledge the English and Scottish Electricity Authorities can reasonablyaim at having at least 5,000 MW. of nuclear capacity in operation by the end of1965, and that if technological development continues to be favourable and thenecessary physical and financial resources can be made available, a figure of6,000 MW. could be achieved by that date.3. The Government have decided, with the full agreement of the electricity authorities and the Atomic Energy Authority, to adopt as the basis for presentplanning a range of 5,000-6,000 MW. of nuclear capacity in operation by the endOf 1965.- This means that the supply of raw materials for nuclear generation, theacquisition of sites and the planning of the transmission network will be on a scalesufficient to bring 6,000 MW. of nuclear capacity into operation by the end of 1965.The actual amount of nuclear capacity to be installed by that date will be subjectto technical experience and development as planning progresses, including the trend of capital costs, and to the availability of physical and financial resources.4. I am authorised to say that the Government of Northern Ireland are to-dayannouncing that the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland intend, with theapproval of the Government, to bring into commission a 150 MW nuclear station in 1963 or 1964.5. We must not assume that the nuclear programme represents an easy orpainless solution to our energy problems. It holds out the brightest prospects forthe future: a full year&apos;s operation of 6,000 MW. generation capacity would savesome 18 million tons of coal. But its execution would mean that the annualinvestment programme of the Electricity Authorities would rise during the early60&apos;s by some two-thirds above its present level. This would mean a very heavy burden on the nation&apos;s capital resources during a period when those resources arelikely in any event to be seriously strained.6. The programme will moreover involve the erection of new power stations and of overhead transmission lines in parts of the country which have not hithertofelt the impact of the nation&apos;s requirements for electricity. This is unfortunatelyinevitable because nuclear stations raise special siting problems. Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Electricity Authorities are determined to carry through theprogramme with the least possible interference with the amenities of our country-side or with the rights of individuals. But these rights can be fully safaguarded while at the same time allowing for that acceleration of the present procedure which is essential if the programme is not to be seriously delayed. MyRight Hon. Friend, the Paymaster General, will accordingly be tabling a numberof minor amendments to existing legislation for inclusion in the Electricity bill which is at present before the House of Commons.7. I would only add that nothing said about the prospects of the nuclear power programme in any way affects the importance of the coal industry. Howeverrapidly we develop nuclear energy, coal will remain the basis of our economy andthe need to exploit to the full our national coal resources remains as urgent as ever.22nd February, 1957.51248
Appendix BPROPOSALS FOR AMENDING legislation. Procedure on Applications for Consent to Establish Generating Stations(a) Repeal of Electric Lighting Act, 1909, Section 2.(b) Amendment of Electricity (Supply) Act, 1919, Section 11, by omittingthe words &quot; other than the Central Authority or the North of scotland board.&quot;This would have the effect of extinguishing the present statutory right of thelocal authority and of owners and lessees of land within 300 yards of the site ofa proposed generating station to receive notice of the proposal and to stateobjections direct to the Minister. Instead (by virtue of the administrative arrangements agreed between the Ministry of Housing and Local Government andthe Ministry of Power, and operating in cases of deemed planning procedure) thelocal authority and such owners and lessees would in practice be no worse off thanthey are in relation to any other industrial development.The reason for these proposals is to obviate the delays which are imposed on the programme by the present procedure. This entails inviting individualobjections (for which reasonable time is in practice provided) as laid down bySection 2 of the Act of 1909 and, by agreed administrative practice, scrutiny and consent by the local planning authority. The procedure of the Town and country planning Acts appears to suffice for other forms of industrial development, andthere is no reason to continue the procedure of the Act of 1909 which was, ofcourse, instituted at a time when &quot; planning Acts &quot; were unknown.2. Procedure for Stopping up and Diverting HighwaysAmendment to the Sixth Schedule of the Town and Country Planning Act,1947, to reduce the period for objections from three months to thirty days.Present procedure for making orders (by the Minister of Transport and CivilAviation) provides for advertisement and for display of the draft order and mapover a period of three months, during which objection may be made. Theprocedure cannot be put into force until planning permission for the development has been given in the case of generating stations that is not until the Ministerof Power has given his consent and deemed planning permission. But entry onthe land and work on the station site is by then urgent, and rights of way arenow quite frequently obstructed with tacit agreement of the local authority concerned. Compliance with the law imposes at least a three months&apos; delay onthe start of the work and if objections lead to a local enquiry the delay can bemuch longer. Any individual objector could bring about such a delay in startingwork, and this delay could of course be prolonged if final approval was followedby a period of bad weather. It is proposed that this new procedure should be confined to electricity development.3. Rights of Entry on Land to Assess its Potentialities or the Nature and Cost ofWorksProvision is needed to give Electricity Boards a right of entry on land forthe purposes of survey and making trial bores. At present there is no right of entry, except by consent, in relation to proposed electricity works in England andWales so that an Electricity Board may not be able to satisfy themselves completelythat a site which appears suitable from maps is in fact suitable and economic fora generating station. In the case of routes for overhead lines for the same reasons it may well be impossible for a Board, in advance of the Ministers consent to the route, to make any survey of the tree felling which might be necessary or to choose
the best footing for poles or pylons: as a result a hearing or enquiry into an application for a compulsory wayleave often cannot be combined with a hearinginto the question of tree cutting and compensation therefor. This prolongs thewhole procedure by many weeks and is often inconvenient to owners.The principle of rights of entry for survey purposes has already been conceded in Section 3 of the Hydro-Electric Development (Scotland) Act, 1943, which givespower to the North of Scotland Board to enter on land to-&quot; make such surveys and collect such information as they may consider necessary to ascertain the water power resources in the North of ScotlandDistrict or in any part thereof .      .&quot;subject to giving not less than seven days&apos; notice and subject to payment of reasonable compensation for any damage caused.

REVISION OF THE NUCLEAR POWER PROGRAMMEI.-introduction. The task of the Working Party has been to examine the implications forthe electricity supply industry of an acceleration of the Programme of nuclear power set out in the White Paper of February 1955 (Cmd. 9389).2. The Working Party consisted of representatives of the Central electricity authority (C.E.A.), the South of Scotland Electricity Board (S.S.E.B.), the atomic energy Authority (A.E.A.), and of the following Government Departments:Treasury, Atomic Energy Office, Scottish Home Department and the Ministry of power. The Board of Trade, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, theMinistry of Labour and National Service and the North of Scotland Hydro-ElectricBoard have been consulted on various points.3. This Report deals throughout with the electricity requirements of Englandand Wales and of the area covered by the South of Scotland Electricity Board.While the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board and the Electricity Board for northern Ireland will probably wish to instal nuclear generating capacity duringthe period under review, their requirements are unlikely to be large enough to affect significantly the general conclusions.II.-HISTORICAL SUMMARY4. The White Paper of February 1955 gave a provisional nuclear programmecovering the period 1955-65. This envisaged twelve nuclear power stations in commission by the end of 1965 with a total capacity of 1,500-2,000 MW andhazarded a guess that at the end of the period nuclear generating capacity mightbe coming into commission at the rate of some 500 MW per annum. It added that&quot; if all went well &quot; it might be practicable by the early 1970&apos;s to expand the rate of construction of nuclear power stations to match total requirements of newgenerating capacity which by this time might amount to about 3,000 MW a year.5. In the two years since the White Paper was issued, technical progress inthe field of nuclear power has been sufficiently rapid to justify the C.E.A. in placingcontracts for stations with an output capacity of 300 MW at Bradwell and 275 MWat Berkeley compared with the maximum of 200 MW per station assumed in the1955 White Paper. An order for a 300 MW station has also been placedprovisionally by the South of Scotland Electricity Board.6. The public has been kept aware of the rapid advances in nuclear technology and pressure has been mounting both inside and outside Parliament for a substantialupwards revision of the 1955 White Paper. The Minister of Fuel and Power(Mr. Aubrey Jones) refused to commit the Government until the Bradwell andBerkeley tenders had been thoroughly examined by the C.E.A. and this processcould not be completed until December. The award of the contracts for the twostations was announced by the C.E.A. on 13th December, 1956, and on17th December, Mr. Aubrey Jones stated in the House of Commons that he hoped the Government would be in a position to make an announcement on the revisionof the Nuclear Programme after Parliament reassembled.III.-BACKGROUND7. There are a number of general considerations that Ministers will wish tobear in mind in considering the amount of effort that the nation should devote tothe nuclear programme during the next decade. Any attempt to estimate thesituation 10 or .15 years hence is bound to involve a considerable measure of judgment and a decision on a programme covering this length of time cannot be entirely dependent upon a detailed examination of figures. Some of the general considerations can be summarised very briefly as follows:  (a) There has been a continuing shortage of primary fuels since the middle ofthe last war and imports of oil and coal have had to be increased until they now meet a quarter of the United Kingdom&apos;s total energy demand.To satisfy the requirements of the national economy, supplies will, on a51224c*
conservative assumption, have to be increased each year by about million tons of coal equivalent. Supplies of indigenous fuels cannotbe increased sufficiently to meet these growing requirements which will therefore involve rapidly increasing dependence on imports. Thisdependence would be accentuated if supplies were limited to the conventional fuels.(b) Nuclear power can eventually make a very appreciable contribution towards improving the balance of payments. It is true that so longas we have to import nuclear fuel there will always be some element offoreign exchange expenditure in nuclear power, but the total costs of nuclear fuel represent a very much lower expenditure of foreign exchange than the cost of an equivalent amount of energy in the formof imported oil or coal.(c) In the shorter term, however, a substantial nuclear power programme would impose burdens on the balance of payments: directly becauseeach nuclear station requires an initial fuel charge which involves asubstantial tonnage of uranium when it is commissioned; and indirectlythrough the effects on our imports and exports of the increasedinvestment load arising from the fact that nuclear stations, especially the earlier types, will require much more capital resources than stationsof the conventional type. The question that now faces the country isthe extent to which such additional investment should be undertaken in the initial period of the programme (a period whose length will bedetermined largely by the speed with which the capital cost of a nuclearstation can be reduced) in order to secure the benefits of nucleargeneration in later years. .\d) The main producers of uranium are such countries as South Africa,Canada and the United States, which can be expected to remain friendly to the United Kingdom and to enjoy settled Governments (the great bulk of United Kingdom supplies are expected to come from canada and South Africa). The tonnage that is needed of these raw materialsis insignificant in volume andThe generation of nuclear electricity could proceed without fear of such interference with shipping routes andpipelines as has caused the present oil shortage. The impact of UnitedKingdom uranium requirements on the shipping position generally would be insignificant compared with the import of an equivalentamount of energy in the form of fossil fuels.(e) In any examination of the domestic nuclear programme, account must betaken of the political and material advantages that should accrue to theUnited Kingdom so long as it retains its lead in nuclear developments.IV.-THREE POSSIBLE PROGRAMMES8. It would be unrealistic to consider a programme of nuclear developmentover any finite period without reference to the requirements (both financial and physical) for subsequent years. The curve of demand for electricity is likely tocontinue to rise for many years to come and the task of meeting it is a continuousprocess, involving planning for a period of five (or more) years ahead. Thus, atany given point in time, the electricity authorities have in hand work on stations to be completed in the current year and work relating to stations in the variousintermediate stages of construction and due for completion over the next five years or so. Moreover, as is pointed out in paragraph 18 below, the healthy developmentof the new nuclear power industry requires that so far as possible the manufacturerswho are going to have to switch their capacity to the production of nuclear plantshould be given a reasonable prospect of continuity of demand for nuclearequipment a condition that requires a review of the programme up to 1965 totake some account of the rate of nuclear commissioning after 1965. On the otherhand it would be difficult at this point of time to make any very useful estimatesabout the place of nuclear power in the electricity industry after about 1970. Withthese considerations in mind forecasts have been taken up to the year 1970 but notbeyond.9. As a basis for the Working Party discussions, the. C.E.A. in consultationwith the S.S.E.B. have prepared three illustrative plans for generating plant which
provide for a total nuclear output capacity of 12,000 MW by 1970* (out of atotal estimated output capacity including nuclear and conventional plant of51,000 MW) representing the maximum nuclear capacity which the C.E.A.consider to be prudent as a basis for planning in the light of the present knowledgeof costs and technical considerations. The plans have been prepared to providefor three different levels of commissioning of nuclear plant by 1965 within the assumed overall nuclear output capacity of 12,000 MW by 1970, and have been worked out in as much detail as regards siting of new stations, construction oftransmission systems, and availability of conventional fuel, as has been possible inthe very limited time available.10. The plans assume an annual overall plant commissioning level of2,250 MW output in 1961, 2,500 MW from 1962 to 1965, and 2,600 MW from1966 to 1970, and the nuclear programmes contained therein may be summarisedas follows:  Programme A provides for commissioning up to 3,425 MW output of nuclear plant by 1965, and this would be installed in 11 stations on 10 sites.The rate of commissioning would reach 800 MW by 1965, but thereafterwould be stepped up to 1,600 MW for each of the next five years to reach the overall figure of 12,000 MW by 1970. This programme differs from theoriginal White Paper proposals of 1955 in that it takes advantage of thetechnical progress which has enabled the output capacity of reactors to be almost doubled. A further difference is that eleven stations are now envisaged in place of the original twelve.Programme B provides for commissioning up to 4,575 MW output of nuclear plant by 1965, which would be installed in 15 stations on 13 sites.The rate of commissioning would reach 1,350 MW by 1965, and thereafterwould be at the annual rate of 1,400 MW again to build up to a total of12,000 MW by 1970.Programme C provides for commissioning up to 5,975 MW output of nuclear plant by 1965, which would be installed in 19 stations on 16 sites.This is the maximum level of nuclear plant regarded by any member of theWorking Party as a prudent target for 1965, and would involve acommissioning rate of 1,850 MW in that year. If the capacity of nuclearplant in operation in 1970 were to be limited to 12,000 MW, this would requirethe annual rate of commissioning to be cut back to 1,200 MW after 1965.V.-CONSIDERATIONS RELEVANT TO THE CHOICE OF PROGRAMME(i) The Load Factor11. Nuclear plant involves heavy capital cost mainly for engineering reasonsbut partly also because the initial fuel charge is included in the first cost of thestation but the running costs (including fuel replacement) during the life of thereactor should be low. The capital cost per kilowatt of capacity of the earliernuclear stations will be very much higher than that of conventional stations. Thefirst batch of stations are some three times as expensive as contemporaryconventional stations and 3\ times when the initial fuel charge is taken intoaccount. The figure (including initial fuel charge) for the advanced types of nuclearstations which should be coming into commission around 1965 will probably beat least two and a half times as much as&quot; that for contemporary conventionalstations. On the other hand, once a nuclear station has been built, its running costs (excluding capital charges) should be less than half the running costs of aconventional station of the same capacity. The development of nuclear techniqueis expected to result in a progressive reduction in capital cost of plant and buildingsper unit produced and in progressive increases in the efficiency in the use of fuel.If more expensive enriched fuels are used, the increased cost per ton of such fuelsshould be more than offset by their greater efficiency. It can, therefore, be expectedthat the unit costs of electricity from nuclear stations will decrease progressively.12. The earliest types of nuclear plant will, because of their heavy annualcapital charges, be economic only when they are used on base load, that is with* Alternatives have also been prepared for each plan which would restrict the nuclear output capacity to 8,000 MW by 1970 on the assumption that all available coal supplies would be utilisedin conventional plant together with the minimum consumption of oil. These are not considered further in the present document.51224
a plant load factor of not less than 75 per cent. The estimated base load availablefor nuclear generation in 1970 will be about 8,500 MW* and the extent to whichnuclear capacity in that year can be economically justified in excess of the baseload will depend on the success of the efforts to render nuclear plant capable ofshowing an economic return at lower load factors.13. The bearing of this consideration on the nuclear programme in the yearspreceding 1970 is obvious. It raises, however, a particularly difficult problembecause there is so little concrete experience upon which to base a judgment. Thereare two main factors involved:  (i) whether nuclear stations will be sufficiently flexible in operation to meeteffectively as part of a public supply system the varying levels of demandupon their capacity;(ii) whether the reduction in total capital costs and the resulting decrease in annual capital charges will be sufficient to enable the stations to becompetitive at a low load factor.It is believed that both these problems will be solved. Indeed, A.E.A. for their partbelieve that (i) raises ho serious difficulty, and that, so far as (ii) is concerned,nuclear stations having the necessary low capital costs can be evolved within theperiod under review.  The real question is one of timing as regards (ii).14. The answer to this question must depend on an estimate of the rate of technical progress over the next few years. Including initial fuel charges, the capital cost of the two first stations at Bradwell and Berkeley will be about  174 perkilowatt of output capacity. It is on this basis that it is estimated that a nuclearstation must work at about 75 per cent, load factor to pay its way. The C.E.A. indrawing up their illustrative plans have assumed that by 1970 progress will havebeen sufficient to enable one-third of the nuclear capacity in commission to operateeconomically at less than base load so that, allowing for 8,500 MW of nuclear plantworking at base load, 12,000 MW would be about the maximum economic nuclearoutput capacity to commission by 1970. C.E.A. believe that it would be imprudentin the present state of knowledge to base planning on the assumption that this figure could be exceeded and have related each of their three illustrative nuclearprogrammes to this &quot; economic ceiling.&quot;15. The A.E.A. representatives on the Working Party have expressed the viewthat this figure of 12,000 MW in 1970 should not be regarded as a firm figure for planning purposes. They believe that:  -(a) The early nuclear stations are likely to be very flexible technically.(b) It is to be expected that with a new industry on which a great deal ofdevelopment effort is being expended, the rate of advance will be rapid and the costs of generating nuclear power will fall rapidly during theperiod under review. In particular, it can be expected that the capital. cost per kilowatt will come down. It would not be unreasonable to expect that the capital cost per kilowatt of nuclear stations coming intocommission in the late sixties might have been reduced to, say, 60 percent, of the cost per kilowatt of the first C.E.A. nuclear stations.On such grounds A.E.A. believe that the &quot; economic ceiling &quot; in 1970 might be,000-4,000 MW higher than the figure used in the C.E.A.&apos;s calculations (i.e.,15,000-16,000 MW instead of 12,000 MW).16. The Working Party as a whole is not qualified to express an opinionon this essentially technical question. The economics of electricity generation inthe later sixties, will moreover depend as at present on a large number of other factors such as the movement of interest rates, of coal and oil prices, the level of construction costs and the load factor itself. It would be highly dangerous toattempt now to make any precise assumptions on these matters.17. We have set out in paragraphs 8-16 above some of the majorconsiderations which must influence the Governments decisions on the size of the* This estimate might be increased by perhaps 1,000 MW if prospective facilities for pumpedstorage capacity in the Scottish Highlands could be economically developed so as to enable powergenerated during the night by base load nuclear stations to be released as hydro-power for transmissionto the main consuming areas to meet their daytime peak. The North of Scotland Hydro-ElectricBoard are engaged on a survey of the economic possibilities of such a development.
-41new ten-year programme. We have not regarded it as our duty to assess these considerations in the form of a recommendation in favour of any particularprogramme, and in subsequent paragraphs of this Report we refer to several other considerations which also have a bearing on the decision to be taken. At this stage,therefore, we comment only that a ten-year programme consistent with a nuclearcapacity of 12,000 MW in 1970 reduces some of the risks we have mentioned. Sucha programme still represents a considerable acceleration of the present programme,and leaves room for the Government to indicate their willingness to increase it stillfurther if and when it seems expedient to do so. Such an approach would, ofcourse, require that the production and planning of critical supplies, such asuranium and steel plate, should proceed on a higher level.(ii) The Effect on the Electricity Supply and Manufacturing Industries18. Experience with the plant programmes since the war points to thedesirability of giving manufacturing industry a programme which is free fromany violent fluctuations. This experience is particularly relevant to a nuclearplant programme which involves a major transfer of industrial capacity and effortfrom conventional to nuclear plant and some consideration should be given to avoiding a position in which there might arise a need to switch a substantial partof capacity back from nuclear to conventional plant. If the C.E.A. are right in thinking that the maximum nuclear output capacity that would be economic in1970 is 12,000 MW, then a programme to achieve 6,000 MW output by 1965would imply some reduction in the rate of nuclear commissioning after 1965 anda temporary reversal of the downward trend in the annual rate of commissioningof conventional plant. This might cause some unbalance in the general programmeof construction and plant erection, with some effect on manufacturers&apos; programmes,although the potential embarrassment to the manufacturers would be mitigatedto the extent to which advance warning could be given to them about changes inthe rate of commissioning. There is also the possibility of developing the exportof nuclear equipment.19. It is hoped that the United Kingdom will be able to develop a considerableexport trade in nuclear reactors. Initially these will consist of reactors similar tothose being built for the C.E.A., i.e., large stations of the Calder Hall type. Theywill be required chiefly in industrial countries and it is, therefore, to be expectedthat some of the equipment will be provided by the countries themselves. exports are likely to be limited to the reactor itself and specialised equipment associatedtherewith; the turbo alternators and conventional electrical plant might well not be exported. There is, however, also the possibility of scaling down the size of theCalder Hall type of reactor to provide an output of 30 to 50 MW. In this casecomplete power stations might be exported to less industrialised countries. in either case the power stations exported are not likely to be commissioned beforeabout 1963 but there might be a sharp rise in the exports from 1965. although we cannot pretend to quantify the effect, the manufacturing load caused by theseexports may well offset to some extent any slackening in the rate of installationin the home nuclear power programme; and there are, of course, obviousadvantages in manufacturers establishing themselves in the export markets as quickly as possible.20. In the review of the factors to be taken into account two important matters have been considered but remain as unknown &quot; risks &quot; in any programme.The first is the &quot;life&quot; assumed for the reactor in all the calculations. This is assessed at 20 years, on the expert advice of the A.E.A. A change in this figure would, of course, affect the economics of the nuclear power stations favourablyor otherwise. The second is the reliability of the plants. On scientific groundsthere is every reason to believe them reliable, but there is as yet no experience of running a nuclear station for a long period under the conditions necessary in apublic electricity supply system. No special margin has been included in anyof the illustrative programmes to cover these problematical risks. The electricity authorities&apos; plans for total plant commissioning up to 1965 are estimated to besufficient to meet new demands, and to overtake the present deficit of plant in anaverage spell of cold weather, but the C.E.A. consider that the larger the nuclearprogramme the stronger the case for allowing some margin of capacity to coverthese unknowns.        , &apos; . .
(iii) Capital Requirements21. The demands of the nuclear programme upon capital resources arequantified in the following table, which shows the estimated capital cost of the stations which will need to come into commission during the years 1961-65.The figures include (besides the capital cost of the power stations) the cost of the transmission network and working capital relating to nuclear fuel, but excludeother working capital and expenditure on distribution since these last two items are broadly common to conventional and nuclear programmes. Current price levels have been used throughout, and the expected reduction in later years in thecapital cost of nuclear and conventional plant has been taken into account. Forthe sake of comparison, a hypothetical programme X based on all-conventionalplant has been added: this is hypothetical because it ignores the nuclear stationson which work has already started; it assumes that fossil fuels would be madeavailable, but takes no account of the capital cost involved in producing andtransporting them.Capital Cost (Generation and Transmission) of Nuclear andConventional Plant Coming into Commission in 1961-65  millionProgramme X (hypothetical: all conventional)       ...      ......        810Programme A      ...      ...      .........      ...      ......     1,190Programme B      ...      ...      ,.........      ...      ......     1,310Programme C......      .........      ...      ......     1,46022. In order to show the full effect of the burden on capital investmentresources, it is also necessary to show broadly how the capital expenditure willbe phased year by year. For this purpose (again taking the same assumptions about price levels) an attempt has been made to estimate the phasing of expenditurein each financial year. The figures are based on the C.E.A.&apos;s assumption that,by the end of 1970, 12,000 MW of nuclear plant will be in commission.Expenditure on plants due to come into commission before 1961 and after 1965has been added and so have the items (distribution and other working capital)which are excluded from the table in paragraph 21. The resultant figures are thus broadly comparable with the electricity industry&apos;s current total capital investment programme.Total Capital Investment by the	Central	Electricity	Authority	andSouth of Scotland Electricity Board								  million		Programme		Financial years	X	A	B	CYear 1956-57    .........	230	230	230	230Average of 4 years (1957-58.to 1960-61)	250	280	280	280Average of 5 years (1961-62 to 1965-66)	270	360	380	400Total over 10 years (1956-57 to 1965-66)	2,580	3,150	3,250	3,35023. Although under hypothetical programme X capital expenditure shows asmall but steady rise from year to year, it will be seen that the increase under thethree nuclear programmes is greater. Of the capital expenditure required underthese programmes over the next ten years, nearly two-thirds falls into the five-year period 1961-62 to 1965-66, and it is only in this period that costs begin to differnoticeably as between the three. Indeed, if it is assumed that the total nuclearcapacity in 1970 is 12,000 MW, the difference between the illustrative programmesfrom the investment point of view is mainly one of timing; programme C, for,example, means more stations of the early and, therefore, expensive type in theearly sixties.(iv) Supply of Materials24. None of the three programmes considered by itself (we are not concernedwith the military programme) presents an insuperable problem in respect of thesupply of nuclear materials. In broad terms the amount of steel required forProgramme B is about the same as the requirement in 1956. Programme A would need slightly less and Programme C slightly more. From now until 1963, however,there will be very severe competition for tubing and more particularly for the thick:steel plate which the Nuclear Programme will need in comparatively large
quantities. Special steps may be needed to ensure adequate supplies of these products. Certain special engineering and instrumentation requirements will also need particular attention, as will the supply of certain special materials such asberyllium, zirconium and new steel alloys.(v) Supply of Labour25. The Ministry of Labour and National Service have advised that thereis already difficulty in meeting the demand for skilled manpower in the turbo-generator industry a difficulty which would be increased by any of the threeprogrammes. There will also be a serious shortage of skilled welders for fabricationon the site, as the programmes would be in competition with the shipbuilding industry.  Special steps may therefore be needed in the case of these groups.26.   A considerable increase will be needed in the labour force on sites:  but the Ministry of Labour do not in general expect any serious difficulties to ariseprovided that Irish labour is acceptable. Carpenters and steel erectors will, as now, be difficult.(vi) Procedure Relating to Power Station Siting and Overhead Lines21. The siting and building of generating stations and the routeing ofelectricity lines are matters which may concern several Government departments and must concern the local planning authority and statutory bodies such as RiverBoards. The time spent in consultations and on public enquiries has been growingof late years as the procedures have become more complex and the number of relatively unobjectionable sites and routes diminishes; these difficulties will beaccentuated by the introduction of nuclear power stations. Certain administrative action can be taken to minimise delays at some points but there is no doubt thata major programme of the sort envisaged could still, because of its novelty and special technical needs, and the greater number of sites involved, be seriouslydelayed if present procedures have to be continued without amendment. It mustbe emphasised that the time that has to be spent on these matters is the time of senior and specialist officers whose whole energies are required for the tasks of technical planning and construction.28. Any programme of nuclear power will involve an increased interferencewith public amenities and private interests. Indeed, the only means of makingabsolutely certain that procedural matters will not prevent any of the threeillustrative programmes being completed on time would be to free the electricity authorities from statutory planning procedures to an extent that could not becontemplated in peacetime. There is, therefore, no guarantee that there will notbe major delays in completing the programmes and the larger the programme the greater will be the danger.29. This danger will be very serious indeed unless the electricity authoritiesare relieved from certain of their existing obligations. The amendments to legislation which this would involve would be comparatively few in number,although they might well prove controversial. For instance, generating stationprojects are subject to more exacting control than any other industrial development.Not only do the requirements of the Town and Country Planning Acts apply butalso, under the Electric Lighting Act, 1909, prior notice, by advertisement orotherwise, must be given to owners and lessees of land within 300 yards of the site,who must be given time and opportunity to state objections. The result has beenthat consents for conventional power stations have been increasingly delayedduring the past ten years by the need to deal with such objectors, who would haveno such special locus if it were a case of any other industrial development, evenif there were an enquiry under the Town and Country Planning Acts. If therequirements of the 1909 Act were abolished, generating station projects wouldbe on an equality with other industrial development and might be subject to lessdelay than at present. This change would, however, have to be accompanied bya rather stiffer attitude toward local planning authorities.Present labour force22,00033,000^44,000 y55.000JProgramme a programme BProgramme CMaximumup to 1965

The C.E.A. are committed by contracts with the oil companies to increase their total use of oil to about 8 million tons a year of coal equivalent, and becauseof the expected continuing shortage of coal in the years immediately ahead theyhave no alternative but to complete the programme for oil-fired stations on whichthey are already engaged. This should be done by the early sixties. Thereafter,,while it would be possible for the oil contracts to be terminated and oil consumptionreduced to a very low level, it is likely to be economically attractive to the C.E.A.to continue using the stations for oil burning instead of converting them back to coal at considerable capital cost. In that case, the power station demand for solidfuel, which is expected to be about 47 million tons in 1957, would be only46 to 51 million tons in 1965 and only 49 million tons in 1970.35. The savings that will be secured by the nuclear power programme will,,however, consist of the smaller sizes and inferior qualities of coal normally used in power stations. As the supply of these types of coal is already comparatively easyand is likely to become progressively easier during the next few years, special measures will be needed if the United Kingdom energy situation is going to benefitto the full extent rendered possible by the nuclear programme. We cannot assume that by the middle sixties export markets will be able to absorb the whole of thiscoal, while British consumers, if left to themselves, would neither wish to consumemore of it nor be equipped to do so. To avert the danger of growing surpluses ofunsaleable coal it will be necessary to modify the screening and washing facilities at the collieries, to alter consumers&apos; appliances and to bring pressure to bear upon them to use the smaller sized coal instead of oil or large coal that has to be imported.It will also be necessary to press on with research and development directed to the conversion of small coal into oil. In view of the growing gap, between ourindigenous resources of fuel and the requirements of the economy, it is believedthat Ministers will want to put these measures in hand and that the potential surplusof small coal should not, therefore, deter the Government from undertaking anambitious nuclear programme.30. More adequate powers of survey are also needed by the C.E.A. andsome minor amendments of existing statutes would be needed to enable certainaction to be taken concurrently which must now be taken in sequence.31. The Electricity Bill now before Parliament provides an opportunity forany amending legislation Ministers may decide to introduce.(vii) Coal Savings32. From the early sixties onwards, as the new stations come into commission,the benefits from them will accrue in the form of rapidly increasing coal savings.The capacity installed at the end of 1965 would be sufficient in a full year&apos;soperation to save .11, 14 or 18 million tons according to whether the A, B orC programme was adopted. It is estimated that these savings will be equivalentto 3-3, 4-2 and 5-4 per cent, respectively of the total energy demand in the middlesixties. If, for the sake of illustration, 12,000 MW were installed at the end of1970, a full year&apos;s operation of this capacity would save 32 million tons-which represents about 9 per cent, of the expected total energy demand at that time.33. The following table shows the impact of the assumptions made in thepreceding paragraph on the power station demand for coal:  Fuel Requirements for Public Electricity Supply in Great Britain,excluding North of Scotland and A.E.A.
VI.-conclusions. There are economic, strategic, and political advantages to be derived froma substantial nuclear programme; and, as far as the balance of payments isconcerned, the burden imposed by such a programme would be outweighed by the eventual benefits. (para, 7)2. The three illustrative programmes examined in this Report provide forthe following nuclear stations coming into commission by the end of 1965:  , Coal saving(million tons of coal)Programme No. of        No. of       CapacityA        ............	stations 11	sites 10	MW 3,425	In 1965 9	From full year&apos;s operation 11B        ...      ...      ......	15	13	4,575	11	14C        ...      .........	19	16	5,975	14	181955 White Paper (Cmd. 9389) (for comparison)   ......	12	 	1,500-2,000	- .&apos;	.   5-,6(paras. 4, 9, 10, 32 and 33)3. The implications of these programmes cannot be properly assessed withoutlooking forward another five years beyond 1965, because planning and constructionwork must be continuous. The target for 1965 is therefore dependent to someextent on the probable position in 1970. (para. 8)4. Present day nuclear plant involves heavier capital costs and lowerrunning costs than conventional plant of the same capacity. Thus, early types of nuclear plant can only fee economic when operated on base load (Le., at a loadfactor of not less than 75 per cent.). The estimated base load available for nuclear plant in 1970 will be about 8,500 MW output capacity, and how far nuclearplant can be economically justified in excess of that capacity by that year depends on how far its cost (and particularly its capital cost) can by then be reduced belowpresent levels. (paras. 11-13)5. C.E.A. have assumed that sufficient progress will have been, made tojustify a nuclear capacity of some 12,000 MW by 1970 out of an estimated totalcapacity of 51,000 MW. On this basis, the rate of installation of new capacity inthe period 1965-70 would rise steeply under programme A, remain steady underprogramme B, and fall under programme C. A.E.A. consider that, while it is notpossible to make a precise estimate, the capital cost of nuclear stations islikely to fall sufficiently rapidly to justify a somewhat higher figure (perhaps15,000-16,000 MW) for 1970, and that, on this assumption, none of the programmes would involve any decrease in the rate of commissioning of nuclear stations after1965. We express no opinion on this question, which is essentially a matter of technical judgment, and in any event can hardly be resolved in isolation from anumber of other factors about which precise assumptions cannot at present bemade; but a programme based on the lower figure would reduce some of the risks while leaving the way open for further acceleration later, provided that timelyaction were also taken to obtain supplies of critical materials for a higherprogramme. (paras. 9, 10, 14-17)6. (i) It is desirable to give manufacturing industry a programme free fromviolent fluctuations. Such fluctuations would arise on programme C unless the1970 capacity proves to be materially higher than 12,000 MW, or the export marketsmoothes them out at the right time. (paras. 18-19)6. (ii) In the absence of operating experience under the conditions necessaryin a public electricity supply system, there are at present two unknowns of fundamental importance to the economics of nuclear generation the life of thereactor (which has been assumed to be 20 years) and its reliability. The,C.E.A.feel that the larger the nuclear programme the stronger the case for allowing somemargin of capacity (not at present allowed for in the illustrative programmes) tocover these unknowns.: (para. 20)
7. Even the lowest of the three programmes would greatly increase the costof the electricity industry&apos;s capital investment programmes, particularly during the 8. Nuclear material supplies should be sufficient provided early decisions are taken, but there will be particular problems in ensuring adequate suppliesof certain other materials, especially tubing and thick steel plate. Labour supplymay present difficulties and special measures may be needed to overcome these.9. The problem of finding power station sites is becoming progressively more difficult and, because of the more exacting siting requirements of nuclearstations, any of the three programmes will involve increased interference with public amenities and private interests, if delays are to be avoided. The C.E.A.believe that the risk of serious delays in completing any of the programmes on time will be greatly increased unless the electricity authorities can be relieved of certain of their present obligations. To make absolutely certain that the programmescould be completed on time would involve major legislation of a sort that couldnot be contemplated in peacetime; and unless the electricity authorities are affordedsome relief, the danger of delays would be very serious indeed. Such relief couldbe secured by some amendments to existing legislation. - These would not be verynumerous but might prove controversial. (paras. 27-31)10. The coal saved in 1965 would be 9 million tons under Programme A,11 million under Programme B, and .14 million under Programme C. If therewere a nuclear capacity of 12,000 MW by end 1970, the coal saving from that capacity in a full year would be 32 million tons, representing about 9 per cent, of11. This saving, however, would be in small coal, and vigorous measures will be called for to ensure that full advantage can be taken of savings materialisingin this form. This need not be regarded as a discouragement, nor as a significantfactor in determining the choice between the various programmes, but rather asa challenge to be faced in securing the full potential benefits from an ambitiousnuclear programme.
