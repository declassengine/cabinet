SECRET- rC.(57) 23 COPY NO. ^ 15th February, 1957CABINETA FURTHER ADVANCE IN education memorandum by the Minister of EducationMy predecessor circulated his paper (C.F.(56) 278) before our recent discussions on economic policy.   If it had been composednow, I think I should have put what he had in mind in greater detail.These points I will instead set out orally.2. It is sufficient to say here that I feel most strongly that to offset the painful economies we have to make, we must have somethingpositive to offer in the field of education.   The proposals I have in mindwill, at any rate in the immediate future, be quite modest and in the nextEstimate will probably cost little or nothing;.3. The crux is the building programme.   My colleagues will remember that this has been held up largely owing to the pressure onthe building industry.   This pressure is now relieved.   Indeed, I am advised that if I were not to have the modest increase of authorisationsfor which I shall be asking, there might well come a hiatus owing tothe increased rapidity with which schools are being built.   This couldbe justified neither on the ground of economy nor of policy.4. The building programme which my predecessor had in mindwould involve an authorisation of  55 millions to commence in 1957/58, 60 millions in 1958/59,  65 millions in 1959/60 and  70 millions in1960/61.   But these figures - which would add nothing to the currentEstimates - would obviously be a matter of negotiation between myDepartment and the Treasury and what is immediately necessary is the assurance that authorisations of  55 millions for 1957/58 and 60 millions for 1958/59 will be forthcoming.   Any additions to the  -Education Vote, and there will be some, would be negotiated separatelybetween the Departments, or dealt with in a later paper.H.Ministry of Education, W.l.4th February, 1957
