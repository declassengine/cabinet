Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1957The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. [It is issued for the personal use of........... .........      ...... ........TOP SECRET &apos; Copy No.C. (57) 3113th February, 1957CABINETNATIONAL HEALTH service memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer attach a report by officials oh the administrative aspects of the proposal thatcontributions should play a larger part in the financing of the National health service.2.   Two points emerge clearly from this report:-(i) That it would be administratively practicable to increase the contributoryelement in the Health Service, and that the legislation for this purposecould be so drawn as to exclude amendments designed to increaseNational Insurance benefits.(ii) That it would be administratively indefensible to have a separate national health stamp. This would be costly, in money, in manpower and inemployers&apos; time.3. If, therefore, we proceed with this plan, we should do so by introducing a composite stamp showing separately the amounts payable in respect of national insurance and the Health Service respectively. The scheme might be brought intooperation before the new stamps were ready for issue, by the device of overprintingon the existing stamp a reference to the amount of the total contribution attributable to the Health Service.4. Before taking our decision, however, we must look seriously at theprospects of the National Insurance Fund. In 1958 the Fund will run into deficitto the extent of  40 millions; and, if contributions and benefits remained unchanged,this deficit would rise to  380 millions per annum by 1975. At first sight this financial prospect looks desperate, and it may prove to be so. Our best chanceof solving the problem depends on increasing our national wealth at such a pacethat we can cover this sum from part (for we could only afford to spend a part ofit on this) of an increase in production, profits, and therefore revenue, and anincrease in the contributions paid by workers from their higher wages.5. Immediately, however, we are concerned, not so much with the long-term problem, as with the pressure which is already developing for increases in the ratesof National Insurance benefit, particularly in the rates of retirement pension.  This51194B
pressure is making itself felt already, and it will increase. We must consider very carefully whether, by raising the amount of the stamp affixed to the national insurance card, we shall enhance it to a point at which - it would be difficult to resist it.If we thought that this pressure would become uncontrollable, there might be something to be said for increasing, in a single comprehensive measure, both the contribution towards the financing of the Health Service and also the rates of bothcontribution and benefit under the National Insurance scheme. That course wouldhave the advantage that, by raising both contributions and benefits simultaneously,it would provide the conventional sugar for the pill. Its disadvantages would be(i) that action would be delayed; (ii) that the savings would be offset by additionalcharges on the Exchequer in respect of the Insurance scheme; (iii) that the total increase in the amount of the weekly contribution could not be less than 2s. \0d.,of which the employer would bear \s.; and (iv) that we should have abandoned our original idea of establishing a separate Health Service contribution which wouldprovide us with a more flexible instrument for the future. It was, after all, the essence of the original conception that people using the Health Service should berequired to pay more for the same service.6.   The major choice for the Cabinet is between the following alternatives:  (a) to introduce this session a National Health Service Bill to increase thecontributors&apos; share in the financing of the Health Service, by theadministrative device of a double stamp on the National Insurancecard; or(b) to proceed as soon as practicable with comprehensive legislation providingfor (a) above and at the same time increasing both contributions and benefits under the National Insurance scheme.7. If the Cabinet decide in favour of alternative (a) in paragraph 6, decisions will be needed on the following points:  (a) Whether the contribution to the Health Service should initially be fixed at Is. 6d. (a net increase of lOd.), or at Is. Sd. (doubling the existingcontribution of lOd. and giving a net increase of Is.), or at 2s. (a net increase of Is. 2d.).(b) Whether the employer should continue to contribute to the Health Serviceand, if so, what his contribution should be.8. Finally, I suggest that the Departments should be asked to consider furtherwthether any of the classes of person who may become voluntary contributorsunder the National Insurance scheme (paragraph 4 of the Annex to the attached report) should be required to pay the new contribution to the Health Service;and, in particular, whether married women in employment should be requiredto pay that contribution, as they are at present required to pay the industrial injuries contribution.P. T.12th February, 1957.
A CONTRIBUTORY NATIONAL HEALTH service the Cabinet decided that, subject to further examination, of the. administrativeimplications, the National Health Service should be established in part on a compulsory contributory basis and directed that further consideration be given as a matter of urgency to the administrative problems entailed. This paper sets out the conclusions reached by officials.2.  The Cabinet discussion envisaged that there should be:  (a) a compulsory contribution to the National Health Service separate fromthat to the Insurance Fund;(b) that employers should not contribute, but should be required to collect the contributions of employees.3. At present there is a single contribution to the National Insurance Fund,and under Section 37 of the National Insurance Act a payment is made from thatFund into the Exchequer in aid of the National Health Service Vote. The amountof that contribution is at the rate of XOd. for each contribution paid by men over 18,with reduced rates for women, boys and girls. In the case of employed persons asmall part (1-Jd.) is paid by the employer. The essential change to be made is toprovide for a separate Health Service contribution which would not be part of therevenue of the Fund but would be paid over to the Exchequer.4.   We think that any arrangement of this kind would require:  (a) the use of the existing Ministry of Pensions and National Insurancemachinery for the collection and enforcement of National health service contributions;(b) that the same categories of insured persons should be made, liable to paythe Health Service contribution as how pay the National health service element of National Insurance contributions whether employed,self-employed or non-employed. (The categories who are exempt, or who have an option to pay, or who receive special treatment are listed inthe Annex.) Those who have the right to opt to pay National insurance contributions and do so would have to be required to pay health service contributions;(c) that the obligation to stamp the employee&apos;s card in respect of the Healthcontribution should rest upon the employer.5. If (b) or (c) were departed from the additional administrative cost of running and enforcing a separate Health Service contribution would be very highsince the duplication of the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurancemachinery would be involved. The only way of securing reasonably effectivecollection and enforcement of the National Health contributions is that this should,as it were, ride on the back of National Insurance collection and enforcement.Indeed it is doubtful whether it would be practicable for the Ministry of Pensionsand National Insurance to operate effectively two schemes with different conditionsof liability and enforcement. If the Health contribution were not enforceable asat (c) above, the only effective sanction available to enforce payment would thenbe to withhold Health Service benefits. We have examined this possibility but are convinced that it is impracticable.A Separate Stamp for the Health service. To have a separate stamp for the National Health Service would involveformidable difficulties in enforcement and substantial additional expenditure.The two stamps would have to be affixed to the same card in order to enableNational Insurance collection and enforcement machinery to operate. The workof checking cards and recording contributions would be doubled, as it would haveto be verified that two stamps had been affixed for each week and for the sameweeks. Something like 1,000 million stamps a year are at present affixed. Thework of the Post Office in the sale of stamps would be doubled. We estimate thatthe cost of this would be about  2 millions a year and the Ministry of Pensionsand National Insurance would need at least 1,000 extra staff costing million.Employers would have comparable increases in staff and administrative costsforced upon them which they would greatly dislike and it would be hard to51194
convince them that these were justified. The bulk of employees would not be impressed by the separate stamp since only about 1Q per cent, see their cards,e.g., when changing their jobs or when they are unemployed. Moreover, over one-quarter of insurance contributions are now paid en bloc by cheque, and stampsare not put on the cards at all. This proportion is steadily increasing with thedevelopment, of mechanised pay systems. Enforcement would be particularly difficult in the case of self-employed and non-employed, unless either national health Service or National Insurance benefits could be refused.7. Under a two-stamp scheme 25 million new cards would have to be issued.If this were done in four quarterly stages under the present system it would takeat least 18 months to introduce. A single issue involving the exchange andrecording of 25 million cards would be a most formidable, if indeed a practicable,proposition. It could not be done under about nine months, and would require some thousands of additional staff for a considerable period for this operationalone.A Single Stamp for the Two Contributions8. There are thus very strong administrative reasons for having a singlecomposite stamp, covering both contributions, which can be affixed to the existingcards. There would be a minimum of administrative cost to the Government and employers. A new stamp of the existing kind, but carrying the new combinedhigher rate, could be issued in about four months from the passing of amending legislation; temporarily subject to further technical examination it may bepossible to add, by overprinting, a reference to the National Health Service element in the contribution. In future issues a reference to both National Insurance and national Health Service could be incorporated in the design. A further argument in favour of a single stamp is the widespread belief that the present single stamppays for a large part of the cost of the Health Service.9. If Ministers decide to proceed with this proposal the following points willrequire decision before a scheme can be prepared for Ministers&apos; consideration^  (a) Whether the basis outlined in paragraphs is approved.(b) Whether the employer should continue to contribute the \\d. which he atpresent contributes to the Health Service element in the insurance stampto the new contribution to the Health Service. The \\d. is the amount which the employers contributed under the pre-1948 scheme and itseems unlikely that they would object to its continuance. If they do not continue to pay it and no adjustment is made, the effect would be thatan adult male employee would under the new system contribute 9d.more than he contributes at present instead of the 8d. envisaged in theCabinet discussion.(c) Whether contributions to the National Health Service should be gradedfor different classes of contributor in the same way as the health service element in the existing stamp.10. The Northern Ireland Insurance Scheme is separate, but under reciprocal arrangements the two schemes operate as one; contributions and benefits are thesame, and insurance records are interchangeable.. Unless the same changes were applied in Northern Ireland (and as yet, of course,&apos;they have no knowledge of thisproposal) the Reciprocal Agreement, including financial arrangements, would need to be revised.11. The legislation would have, not only to impose the National Healthcontribution, but would also have to effect the appropriate reduction in theNational Insurance contribution and to repeal the existing provision for thepayment from the National Insurance Fund to the Exchequer. parliamentary counsel has advised that it should be possible to draft a Bill giving effect to theabove proposals without exposing the front to specific amendments increasingspecific rates of National Insurance benefit. Such amendments do not require amoney resolution, but the scope of the Bill could no doubt be drawn so as to excludethem. (No doubt, however, Opposition members will try to find amendments which are in order, and which can be logically supported by the argument thatbenefits ought to be increased.) From this point of view it would make no difference whether there is one stamp or two. Parliamentary Counsel has alsoobserved that once the contribution towards the National Health Service isdivorced from the Insurance Fund, it becomes an ordinary tax on the subject
requiring the authority of a Ways and Means Resolution, and the Bill to providefor it would, on the face of it, be a Ways and Means Bill. This consideration leadsin turn to the question whether the changes now proposed could or should be madein the Finance Bill itself. It appears clear, even at this early stage, that once thechange has been made subsequent amendments of the rates of National health service contribution could, and would most appropriately, be made in FinanceBills. Whether the change itself could be made in the first instance in the finance bill would require further consideration when the shape of the legislation is more clearly defined, but on the face of it it may well be that the operation is a possibleone.annex.
