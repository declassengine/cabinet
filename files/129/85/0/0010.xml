secret.(57) 10 COPY NO2 6th January, 1957CABINETGOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION IN wales memorandum by the Minister of housing and Local Government and Minister for welsh affairs on 25th January there was published the Third Memorandum ofthe Council for Wales and Monmouthshire.   In this Memorandum theCouncil recommend the appointment of a Secretary of State for Wales,with executive responsible for government administration in Wales.It is proposed that he should take over from the present Minister theresponsibility for Welsh matters at present handled in the Ministriesof Agriculture, Education, Health and Housing, and for certain subjectsdealt with by the Home Office.   A summary of the Council&apos;s proposal is in Annex I.2.       A note by an inter-Departmental group of officials is in Annex II.This note, written before the recent Government changes, is in some respects out of date, but the argument in it is not invalidated.   the officials conclude, from a study of the administrative aspects of theproblem, that there is no sufficient case for accepting the serious dis-advantages involved in appointing a Secretary of State for Wales with executive responsibility for a Welsh office.3.       The disadvantages, summarised in paragraphs 10 and 11 of annex II, include the following -(a) A Secretary of State for Wales, unlike the Secretary of Statefor Scotland, would be operating under the same law andthe same system of administration as the correspondingEnglish Minister.   A Secretary of State for Wales, in orderto justify his existence, would be bound to demand speciallyfavourable arrangements for Wales, as compared with england.(b) The relatively small size of the units of administration wouldmake a separate administration for Wales costly; and also it would be impossible to have the expertise which can beachieved by specialisation in larger Departments.(c) It would add greatly to the complications in settling policy on matters which were common to other parts of theUnited Kingdom.(d) Tt might well be difficult for a Conservative Prime Ministerto fill the three &quot;Welsh Ministerial Offices recommended bythe Council.-1-
4.       I am in strong agreement with the conclusion reached by the officials.   It is true that the proposals of the Council for Wales will beattractive to many people in Wales on grounds of prestige.   But I donot think that there are any political considerations which provideanything like a strong enough case for overriding the very strong objections.   Personalities apart, I am sure that the appointment as  minister for Welsh Affairs of a Minister who in his own right hasconsiderable executive responsibilities over many aspects of localgovernment represents the best and most logical arrangement.   I will certainly do my best to make it a success.5.       The officials also considered whether, as an alternative, theappointment of a separate Minister for Wales without executive responsibility would be justified. 1 agree with them that this arrange-merit would be unsatisfactory.   I myself asked not to be given the title of Secretary of State for Wales; it would have been obvious that thiswas little more than a change of name, and was far from meeting theplea for a separate Welsh Department.6.       The officials recommended that, if the Council&apos;s main commendation were to be turned down, Departments should consider further steps of administrative devolution within the existing structure.This is important, and is being pursued.   It will considerably help inthe annual Welsh Debate, which is likely to be held during the first halfof February, if I can announce even some quite small move in thisdirection.7.       If my colleaguex agree that the recommendation by the council for Wales for the appointment of a Secretary of State for Wales, with aspearate Welsh Office, should be rejected, we must also decide whetherthis should be announced before or after the Welsh Debate.8.       It would, I take it, be for the F rime Minister to make theannouncement, since it would concern a fundamental question of ministerial responsibility within the Government as a whole, and couldnot appropriately be made by me during the debate.   There is likely tobe criticism in the debate if the Government have not announced its conclusions on a report which, it will be known, has been available to ministers for some time, and was certainly available to the PrimeMinister when the recent Government changes were made.   On the otherhand, there might well be some feeling among Welsh Members if, afew days in advance of the debate, the Government had already come outwith their decision to reject this recommendation; there would undoubtedly be complaints that the Government ought to have waited to hear what interested Members had to say before they finally made up their minds.9.       I accordingly ask my colleagues -(a) to agree that the main recommendation of the council for Wales for setting up a new Welsh Office headed bya Secretary of State should be rejected;  and(b) to consider whether the announcement of this decision should be made before or after the forthcoming WelshDebate.H.B.Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment, S.W.1.25th January, 1957
ANNEX ITHIRD MEMORANDUM OF THE COUNCIL FOR WALES ANDMONMOUTHSHIRESummary of Conclusions of part dealing with Government Administration(The paragraph numbers refer to the paragraphs of the CouncITs Memorandum)182-3. There is a need to improve the machinery of Government organisation in Wales. In particular there is far too little co-ordination of the activities ofGovernment Departments operating in Wales.184-5. The Conference of Heads of Government Offices in Wales is not sufficient to provide this co-ordination and is not in a position to take decisiveaction to deal with special Welsh problems. (This is proved by the fact that theGovernment found it necessary to set up another body to co-ordinate policy onrural Wales arising out of the report of the Welsh Agricultural LandSub-Commission on its mid-Wales investigation.)186. The Minister for Welsh Affairs has no specific executive responsibility and this is a fundamental failing in the present arrangement.187. There is at present insufficient devolution of administrative authorityto Welsh Offices of Departments.189. A Secretary of State for Wales should be appointed with executive responsibility for Government administration in Wales.190. He should be assisted by two Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of Stateand his functions should be discharged through a Welsh Office comprising several departments of State.191. There should be more administrative devolution in those Departmentswhose functions are not transferred to the Welsh Office.192. The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation should establish an office for Wales. (It is at present the only major Department with wide executive responsibilities in Wales without such an office.)193. It will not be sufficient to improve administrative arrangements in deparments without at the same time tackling the question of ministerial responsibility raised by the Council.Paragraphs 194-308 examine the organisation of individual departments and make detailed recommendations.309-11. A wide range of subjects should be brought beneath the Secretaryof State for Wales. He should be a Cabinet Minister assisted by two junior ministers.312-3. A Welsh Office should be established in Cardiff comprising fourDepartments of State based on the existing Offices of Agriculture, Health, housing and Education. The four Departments should not have their functions defined by statute, so that adjustments in their respective responsibilities can be made by administrative arrangement in the light of experience.314. The four Departments would take in all other functions transferred tothe Secretary of State for Wales as follows: -(a) Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food:Forestry;(b) Department of Housing and Local Government:Transport and scheduling of development areas;(c) Department of Education:(d) Department of Home Affairs and Health :Tourism.315. The Principal Architect and Senior Engineering Inspector of theMinistry of Housing and Local Government and the Legal Adviser of the WelshBoard of Health should be upgraded and their Departments expanded so that theycan provide common services for the four new Departments.51106b
316. The Welsh Information Office should report directly to the PermanentHead of the Welsh Office as a whole.317. A &quot; Secretary &quot; should be in charge of each of the four Departments (torank mid-way between Under-Secretary and Deputy Secretary) with two assistant secretaries to assist him.318. One Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State should be responsible forthe Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and of Housing and LocalGovernment and the other for the Departments of Education and Home affairs and Health.319-20. The Permanent Head of the whole Welsh Office&apos;should rank as permanent Secretary.321. The four new Departments should be separate entities with their ownestablishment arrangements.322. There should be one Parliamentary Vote for the Welsh Office with separate Sub-heads for each Department.      -323.   A Liason Office should be established in London.325. There should continue to be meetings of the Heads of Departments in wales under the Chairmanship of the Permanent Secretary of the Welsh Office.326. Close consultation would be required between Welsh and EnglishDepartments to establish the proper application of United Kingdom policy toWelsh needs. &quot; Many of the problems of Wales are markedly different from thoseof England, and this close consultation is therefore essential if the special needs of wales are to be met.&quot;327. The changes proposed would be of lasting benefit to the Welsh people and an early decision is urged.ANNEX IIGOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION IN WALESNote by an Interdepartmental Group of officials. The Council for Wales and Monmouthshire was set up in April 1949with the following terms of reference: -&quot;1. To meet from time to time, and at least quarterly, for the interchange of views and information on developments and trends in the economicand agricultural fields in Wales and Monmouthshire, and2. To secure that the Government are adequately informed of the impact of Government activities on the general life of the people of wales and Monmouthshire.&quot;It consists of twenty-eight members, of whom eight are nominated by the PrimeMinister, twelve represent local authorities and eight represent industry and agriculture. It is thus a body with some claim to reflect public opinion in Wales,but with no claim to special knowledge of government administration. Theproposals for altering the administration of Welsh affairs were prepared by a paneldrawn from members of the Council and are incorporated, and endorsed, in the&quot; Third Memorandum by the Council on its Activities.&quot; The Memorandum willbe published as soon as possible, probably in January, and it is expected that theannual debate on Welsh Affairs will take place early in the New Year,2. The Memorandum makes a detailed survey of Government activities in wales and concludes that there is far too little co-ordination of the activities ofthe,Departments operating in Wales; that too much Welsh business is still settledoutside the Welsh offices; and that too little regard is paid in the working of departments to the special problems and interests of Wales. This the Councilascribe to the absence of any Minister in the Government with executive
responsibility confined to Wales; and to insufficient authority being vested in the heads of Welsh offices. Their remedy is the appointment of a Secretary of Statefor Wales who would be a member of the Cabinet and would be assisted by twoParliamentary Under-Secretaries of State. The Secretary of State would havedirect responsibility for Welsh matters at present handled in the Ministry. ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food, in the Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health; and forcertain subjects (children, police, fire services, remand homes, approved schools and probation) dealt with by the Home Office. The Secretary of State would alsobe responsible for roads, tourism, information work and forestry policy in Wales.Departments which remained on a United Kingdom or England and Wales basis would be expected to devolve responsibility to the maximum to their Welsh offices.Political Statements in the Past3.   All the main Parties have made statements bearing on devolution to Wales.The Conservative Party in their 1955 Election Manifesto said that the settled policy of administrative devolution should go on and, if possible, go further. Theyreferred to the Councils deliberations (leading to the present report) and undertook to consider, in the light of the Councils advice, such further changes as it mightbe practicable and advantageous to make in the present system. In the House ofLords debate on Welsh Affairs on 5th May, 1954, Lord Lloyd said that &quot; [thepresent arrangement] is an advance, but I do not think we have ever regarded thatstep as necessarily final.&quot; (Lords Debates, 5th May, 1954, Col. 389.) In debate on the Government of Wales Bill on 4th March, 1955, Major Lloyd George said:&quot;The Government are willing to consider Whether the process of administrative devolution .... can with advantage be further developed.&quot; (Commons Debates,4th March, 1955, Col. 2472.)4. The Labour Party in their Statement of Policy for Wales, published in1954, proposed that there should be a Minister for Welsh Affairs with a seat in theCabinet. This is of course the existing position; but it appears from remarksmade by Lord Ogmore in the House of Lords debate referred to above that theLabour Party take the view that this Minister should have no other functions.In their statement they favoured further administrative devolution within theexisting framework, but did not raise the idea of a separate Welsh Office. Thematter was not carried further in the 1955 Election Manifesto.5. The Liberal Party, in their 1955 Election Manifesto, supported the ideaof a Parliament for Wales. They would presumably regard a separate welsh office as a step in the right direction, and the Liberal Party of Wales is reportedto be considering its attitude to the idea.Secretary of State for Wales6. Although the Council, in their Memorandum, do not make muchreference to Scotland, it is obvious that they have been greatly influenced in their recommendations by the existing responsibilities of the Secretary of State forScotland. Indeed their proposals involve a close copy of the Scottish arrangements,save that in some matters of detail concerning the United Kingdom Departmentsthey go beyond the Scottish model. In their second memorandum submitted inFebruary 1953 the Council stated that their long-term proposals on administrative devolution might be summarised in the phrase &quot; Parity with Scotland.&quot;7. A comparison with conditions in Scotland does not support the Council&apos;claim. English law and the English pattern of Government were applied to Walesby an Act of 1536. Scotland, on the other hand, had a separate Parliament till1707. By the Treaty of Union of that year the continuity of Scots law, the courts,the burghal system, the Church and the universities was expressly safeguarded.Scotland has, in fact maintained its own laws and legal system, a local governmentstructure which differs from the English, and a distinctive system of land tenure.In the sphere of agriculture there are differences of law and tenure, notably separatecodes for small landholders and crofters, which have no counterpart south of the border. Fishing hot only forms a more important part of the Scottish economy;the industry is organised on a different basis. Professional and commercial interests are represented in the main by separate Scottish organisations&apos; or special Scottishbranches of Great Britain organisations. There is, for example, a separate Scottish51106
T.U.C. In these and many other respects the continuing separateness of scottish affairs is emphasised; and it is this separateness which is reflected in the existenceof the separate departments Of the Secretary of State.8.   Two other aspects of the Scottish analogy should be borne in mind:  (a) The Council for Wales and Monmouthshire complain that too manymatters affecting Wales are settled outside the Welsh offices of departments. It is by no means clear that the setting up of a Secretaryof State for Wales would cure this complaint. Although Scotland hashad a separate Minister since 1885, the recent Royal Commission onScottish Affairs found considerable dissatisfaction iri Scotland over theextent to which Scottish business is settled in London. This is partly because economic questions are handled on a Great Britain basis. Itis also true that whatever basis of organisation is adopted, English,Scottish and Welsh affairs are ultimately determined by the Parliamentof the United Kingdom and, in the executive field, by the UnitedKingdom Cabinet, both of which are, of course, responsible for thewell-being of the United Kingdom as a whole.(b) Parity with Scotland may be the aim of the Council for Wales and monmouthshire. The achievement of parity by Wales, on the otherhand, might not be regarded with equal satisfaction in Scotland andmight add strength to the influences always at work which demandfurther devolution of authority to Scotland.9. The Council refer to the need for co-ordination. They produce no evidence that present co-ordination within Wales, to which much attention hasbeen devoted in recent years, is inadequate. Too much effort at co-co-ordination between wholly separate Departments can be quite futile or worse. The Councilappear to want co-ordination between wholly unrelated matters which would only inhibit efficient administration. As regards devolution of responsibility, theCouncil express themselves as satisfied with the organisation of the Welsh Boardof Health and of the Welsh Office of the Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment. It is by no means clear that further administrative measures wouldnot be sufficient to secure such practical improvements as may have been shown to be desirable. Admittedly, the Council themselves are too far committed to theappointment of a separate Secretary of State to regard further devolution alone as acceptable; they expressly state that the rest of their recommendations, withoutthe appointment of a Secretary of State, &quot; will not achieve a fraction of theimprovement that is needed &quot; (paragraph 193). But they provide no practicalevidence to justify this statement.10. The disadvantages of bringing together the Welsh business for a numberof Departments under a Secretary of State may be summarised as follows:  (a) In matters which are at present divided between a Minister responsible for england and Wales and the Secretary of State for Scotland, a good dealof time and energy is necessarily consumed in reaching agreement upon general policies. These difficulties would be vastly increased and thewhole process ot government in relation to a substantial part of its totalbusiness would become slower and more cumbrous if a third Ministerand a separate &quot; Office &quot; or &quot; Department&quot; were added in respect of wales. In a country (like Great Britain) which has a single Governmentand;a single Parliament, it is difficult enough without great loss of efficiency to divide responsibilities between some members of thatGovernment on a regional basis with two units, as at present. Thecreation of a third unit as now proposed would far more thanproportionately increase the difficulties; indeed, it would make themintolerable. r\;-i.   ....      -(b) The Welsh Departments would be very small.   It would be impossibleto have the expertise in administration which can be - achieved byspecialisation in larger Departments.   Admittedly this difficulty arisesto some extent in Scotland, and possibly to a greater extent in Northernh - Ireland than it would in Wales; but it is a factor to be considered beforebiuou   further small units of administration are created. -       -v(c) A Secretary of State for Wales, unlike the Secretary of State for Scotland,would be operating under the same statutes, the same law: the same
: legal system and the same system of administration as the correspondingEnglish Minister. Difficulties would undoubtedly arise if the Secretaryof State for Wales began to follow different policies or to exercise hisstatutory powers in a different way from his English colleagues. Therewould be questions as to how the differences were to be explained andreconciled and there might well be manifest inequalities as between: Wales and England, particularly along the marches of Wales, wherethe social lives of the various townships, localities and communitiesare so closely interlocked. The special position of ^ Monmouthshire; would be an additional complication. (It is so customarily linked withWales for administrative purposes that it would presumably have tobecome the territory of the Secretary of State for Wales. But it is an english county, and its position would certainly cause controversy.) Thecreation of different machines of government for adjacent areas on the boundary might impede orderly administration in all sorts of ways.Yet, unless a Secretary of State for Wales can take a line of his own,he is largely superfluous.id) A Secretary of State for Wales would be driven to demand specialconcessions for Wales, such as higher rates of grant. The Council saythat their proposals do not involve special legislation for Wales; butinevitably, as time went on, the Secretary of State, in order to justify hisexistence, would be bound to ask for special arrangements; which wouldrequire special legislation and would, to that extent, still further increasethe pressure on Parliamentary time.(e) Separate administration for Wales would inevitably be costly because ofthe relatively small size of the units of administration which would have-    to be set up. .11. A Conservative Prime Minister would be likely to encounter difficultyin finding men to fill the new Ministerial offices, of which three are proposed. a secretary of State and two Parliamentary Under-Secretaries. Presumably it wouldbe expected that the aim would be, on the Scottish analogy, to appoint members who represent constituencies in Wales or Monmouthshire. There are only sevenUnionist members in these constituencies, two of whom are already Ministers.No doubt Welsh Peers and even Welshmen representing English constituenciescould be included; but still the field of choice would be closely restricted.12. A major change of the kind contemplated by the Council would almost certainly require legislation.Minister without Portfolio13. The question arises whether there is any alternative, short of creating a Secretary of State for Wales with executive responsibilities, which should beconsidered by Ministers.14. The obvious alternative, which would not give rise to the difficultiesset out in paragraph 10 above, is a Minister for Welsh Affairs who is engagedfull time on Welsh matters but has no executive responsibilities. Such a minister would take the annual Welsh debate, would answer Questions in Parliamentrelating to general matters affecting Wales, and would advise Ministers on Welshaspects of general policy. But this is exactly what the Home Secretary and Ministerfor Welsh Affairs does at present. So far from the creation of such a Ministerialoffice being an advance, a separate Minister would lose the special authority whichhe at present has by being Home Secretary as well, and his lack of executive responsibility would be more clearly exposed. For this arrangement to be acceptable at all to Welsh opinion, the Minister would have to be a memberof the Cabinet, and he might well find himself in an embarrassing position through his lack of responsibility and duties. The position would probably be inherentlyunstable, would satisfy no one, and would lead to an immediate renewal of thedemand for the creation of a full Secretary of State with executive responsibility.Administrative Devolution        -   .  -&apos; 15. &apos; If it were decided&apos; to leave the present Ministerial position unchanged,the question arises whether the present administrative arrangements could be improved, or at any rate made more acceptable to Welsh opinion; by a furthermeasure of devolution to Welsh offices. - -1&apos; -1 &apos; - &apos;&apos; &quot;    &apos; &apos; &apos; 11 &apos;&quot;
16. As already indicated, the Council say that they are satisfied with theorganisation of the Welsh Board of Health arid the Welsh office of the Ministryof Housing and Local Government. There is, therefore, no need for change inthese two Departments.17. The Ministry, of Education have a Welsh Office in Cardiff to which isdevolved the Ministry&apos;s functions in regard to primary and secondary education.Correspondence with Welsh education authorities on non-delegated matters is alsochannelled through this office. The Council complain that the Permanent secretary and the Assistant Secretary of the Welsh Department are officially stationed inLondon and spend more time there than in Wales. They also complain that manyspecialised functions of the Ministry, such as technical education, school health and the education of handicapped children, have not been delegated to the WelshDepartment. The Ministry of Education point out that the Permanent SecretaryOf the Welsh Department has a more effective say in general policy if he spendsa good deal of time in London and that it would be impossible, without loss of efficiency, to delegate the more specialised tasks to the small office in Cardiff.Welsh interests are fully catered for by the attendance of a representative of the welsh Department at all office meetings in London at which general questions are discussed.It is, however, arguable that the Permanent Secretary and Assistant Secretaryof the Welsh Department ought to be stationed in Cardiff and live there, even if, ashappens with the heads of the Scottish Departments, they spend a substantial amount of time in London. The extent to which there might be further devolution of functions to the Welsh Department, even at some apparent loss of efficiency,may also be worthy of examination.18. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food have a WelshDepartment at Aberystwyth headed by a Welsh Secretary of Under Secretary rank.The Welsh Department carries out a limited number of administrative and executive functions delegated from London and the Welsh Secretary advises on allWelsh aspects of agricultural policy; but he does not control the technical services in Wales or the fairly large executive staff attached to county agricultural executivecommittees.Following on the report of the Arton Wilson Committee the Ministry is atpresent working out and will shortly adopt a scheme of regional organisation. the welsh Secretary will automatically assume in Wales all the functions and authorityproposed for regional controllers in England; this will entail bringing some 900staff under his direct control as against the present figure of about 60. This should go. some way to meet the Councils views.The Ministry is also considering in the light of the Arton Wilson report whether further powers and functions can be delegated to the Welsh Secretary over and above those proposed for regional controllers in England; and whether he couldbe given a certain limited authority over technical staffs in Wales, while preserving the full control on technical matters of the Heads of the technical services inLondon. If in these two ways the Welsh Secretary can be given an advantage over regional controllers in England the views of the Council will be met stillfurther. It should be possible to reach a decision shortly.19. The Council make many minor proposals for increased delegation of authority by other Departments to Welsh offices. Ministers will no doubt wishat least to offer sympathetic consideration of these. But we have not thought itdesirable or necessary to attempt to make detailed recommendations about them until Ministers have had an opportunity of considering their attitude to the main problems. Some of these minor recommendations are impracticable or bad. Manycould be met, if at all, only by minor window dressing which would have little realeffect, since great efforts have been made in recent years to secure the maximum practicable devolution to Wales within the existing framework. But some minorchanges, at least in appearances, could no doubt be secured.20. The Council have a great faith in bureaucracy an attitude which maynot be shared by all their fellow-countrymen. They not only make detailed recommendations on the organisation of the Secretary of State&apos;s offices; but overand over again in the case of those Departments which they agree must, continueto function as one for the. whole of Great Britain, they recommend upgradings ofcivil servants in Wales and increases in staff in the hope of increasing the influence and authority of these staffs. Their aim in this respect is parity with Scotland as aminimum; in some cases they demand higher gradings even than exist in Scotland.
It is relevant that the Royal Commission on Scottish Affairs, did not considerthat there was a purely bureaucratic solution of the Scottish problem. Theyemphasised that it should be clearly established that United Kingdom and GreatBritain Ministers take the same personal interest in the exercise of their departments functions in Scotland as elsewhere. The Governments endorsementin Parliament of this recommendation met with acceptance.21. Virtually none of the Councits proposals for further devolution withinthe existing framework, even though it may ultimately prove expedient to accept some of them, can be justified on administrative grounds in relation to the workwhich is or could be done by those concerned. At the present stage, with the maininterest centred on the more radical proposal for a Secretary of State with a WelshDepartment, it may not be necessary for the Government to reach an immediateconclusion on many of them, or to say more than that they need and will be giventhe most careful consideration. The precise formula will have to depend on thedecision reached on the major issue; if all the Councits recommendations on this score are to be rejected, it will perhaps be necessary to be rather more forthcomingabout alternative proposals for administrative adjustments within the existingstructure, and to announce decisions on the more important ones.Conclusion22. A study of the administrative factors bearing on this problem has led usto the conclusions:(a) that there is no sufficient case for accepting the grave disadvantagesinvolved in appointing a Secretary of State for Wales with executive responsibility for a Welsh Office;(b) that   the   appointment   of   a   separate   Minister   without   executive responsibility would be unsatisfactory and could not be more than atemporary expedient;(c) that urgent consideration should be given by Departments to the Councitsother recommendations for administrative devolution within theexisting departmental structure, with a view to the Governmentannouncing such changes as appear practicable at the same time as itannounces its decision on the major recommendations.23. As soon as Ministers have been able to form a judgment on these conclusions, we shall be able to make suggestions as to the line which might betaken by the Government in announcing its views. By no means all of thearguments set out in this Note are of course suitable for public use.24.
