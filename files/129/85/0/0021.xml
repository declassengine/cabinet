&quot; y 82(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE property OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT)secret.(57) 212nd February, 1957.CAB INETLOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE - THE GENERAL grant memorandum by the Minister of EducationOur discussions lastThursday (C.C.(57) 5th Conclusions,Minute 2) leave me with the impression that I should endeavour to place before my colleagues in writing my objections to the general grant.Originally, the proposed general grant was discussed primarily in relationto the responsibility and status of local government.    Now, the emphasis is on its use as an economy device.2. As an economy device, the general grant could be used either(a)  to bring down local authority expenditure as a whole,or (b)  to change the balance between Exchequer money andrate money by holding down the proportion of grant while expenditure continues to rise.3. If our object is (a), to bring down local authority expenditure as a whole, we shall have to justify it by arguing either that there iswaste and extravagance at present, or that present standards can belowered without damage to the national interest.4. There is no evidence of any significant waste or extravagancein expenditure on education at present.    As long ago as 1921 the geddes committee could find none, and numerous subsequent investigators have come away equally empty-handed.    There is always room for betteradministration and management, but as we cannot point to any significantpotential savings which do not involve changes in national policy, wecannot rest the case on extravagance.5. We should also be foolish to argue that there is room forlowering standards in the education service.    Slum schools, overlargeclasses, and the shortage of scientists and technologists are the mostpublicised deficiencies in education;  there are many others.    I have yet to hear of any knowledgeable person who would suggest that we can maintain and develop our national economy without a large and expensiveimprovement of standards.6. The object must then be (b), to put more of the burden onthe rates.    The rate is a notoriously sensitive form of tax (and probably the most unpopular with our own supporters).    There is a lot of evidencethat even with the present grant formula, the ratepayers are increasinglyrestive under the growing demands of the education service.    We haveCOFY NO. . ^i
loudly professed in recent years the national need for more, and more highly, trained people.     In my judgment, and I believe in the opinionof the public, it is plainly inconsistent with these professions tointroduce a grant system which must inevitably, at the best, slow down the rate of advance.7. I shall be told that the Minister has, or can take, adequatepowers of control to secure the necessary standards.    But in some ofthe most crucial sectors of education it is impossible to defineappropriate standards with sufficient precision for use as a means ofcoercion - for example, the development of sixth form courses and of technical courses as various levels.The contrary argument is that, with the present percentagegrant, my specific controls are inadequate to concentrate expenditureon essentials.    This is not true:  I have control at all key points and can ensure that authorities do not rush ahead on relatively unimportantdevelopm ents.8, It may also be said that education may stand to gain atthe expense of the other small services covered by the general grant.I do not see how this can be so, unless it is held that there is vastextravagance or unnecessarily high standards in these other services.- In fact, the local pressures are more likely to tend the other way -towards improving the minor services by nibbling at education.9. I conclude that the introduction of a general grant is incompatible with our general policy on education, and that to think of itas a device for securing economy, either in local authority expenditure as a whole or in Exchequer grants, involves us in intellectualcontradictions as well as political difficulties.10. Finally, I would remind my colleagues that a previousConservative Government tried a similar scheme in 1925 and had to climbdown in face of widespread opposition.     If we take this on, we shall be involved for the next two years in detailed negotiation and legislation in the face of the strongest opposition from educational opinion, thelocal authorities, and the Labour Party.     It would be a serious blow ifwe had to drop the scheme - and I do not believe we have sufficientlygood arguments for it, or faith in it, to sustain the battle over so longa period.11. The task has been made even more difficult by the recentpublication of a closely reasoned, objective report of a research groupset up by the Institute of Municipal Treasurers.    This makes a carefulanalysis of the effects of percentage grants and concludes that they arethe most equitable form of grant, that they do not in practice lead toextravagance, and that they alone are appropriate where a service isbeing inaugurated or developed.&quot;The present system of specific percentage grantscombined with a general resources equalizer works more efficientlyin practice and is more firmly based in principle than any alternative that has been tried or suggested.    As long asfairness and progress remain important objectives of social policy, we would not expect the system to be modified in anyfundamental way&quot;.
On a general grant, the conclusion is  -&quot;General grants are also irrelevant to problems ofinauguration and innovation and if in more settled cost conditions it has as yet proved impossible to devise an equitable unit grant for a specific service, it is a fortiori likely to prove impossibleto devise an equitable general grant to replace specific grants.If equity is to be an important consideration, the general grantcannot be regarded as a serious competitor to the percentagegrant&quot;.I would beg my colleagues not to underrate the extentto which this report will lend force to the inevitable opposition to theproposed general grant.H.Ministry of Education, W. 1.1st February, 1957.
