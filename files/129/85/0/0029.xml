secret.(57) 298th February, 195 7.FARM PRICE REVIEW, 1957Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the following considerations appear to me to suggestdecisively that on this occasion we must decide now to restrict ouraward to the agricultural industry to the minimum permitted underthe recent Long-term Assurances.1.        This is a year of exceptional financial stringency;all sectors of the community must expect to beartheir share of the burden which this imposes on us.2.        We are already paying  225 millions in agriculturalsubsidies.     Next year&apos;s estimate,   excluding anythingfrom this award, is  233 millions.3.        In the present state of the agricultural industry thereis good reason, as indicated below, for making no positive award at all, or even for starting at a minusfigure.4.        The Long-term Assurances in fact require us to award not less than plus  3^ millions;  this is the true measure of their value to the industry in the first year of their operation.5.        In spite of the weather, the farmers will have had agood year in 1956/57.    Adjusted to &quot;normal yields&quot; -that is ignoring the weather against which they donot expect us to guarantee them - their net income at 334 millions will be  27-1 millions (9 per cent) higherthan in 1955/56, and as high as it has ever been.6.        Within this buoyant net income they have alreadyabsorbed at least some  12-15 millions of the 33j millions of cost increases which have occurred since the last Review.7.        As regards the remaining  18f - 215 millions, wemust rernember:-(a)  the fact that some increased costs should be only temporary (e.g. internal transport rates)since they depend on the petrol tax;COPY NO.0 \CABINET
(b)  the increased efficiency of the industry, whichwe value at  25 millions.8.        There is thus no reason why farmers&apos; income shouldnot increase next year even on a minimum award,since this would still leave them with a  10 millionsshare of increased efficiency.9.        Quite apart from this we are committed to provide some  5 millions a year for 10 years to encouragecapital investment.    We have undertaken to excludethis from the Review calculations, but it is still anadditional burden on the Exchequer.10.      There is no individual justification for any increase at all on any commodity.    On milk and eggs we are faced with an embarrassing surplus which all economicreason calls on us to check.11.      These are the reasons which lead me to the conclusion in paragraph 3 above.12.      Long-term Assurances apart, I recognise the political difficulty which the Minister of Agriculture would have in imposing a positive cut in milk in addition to theburden already imposed on producers by their cost increases and by the built-in quantity limitation in theguarantee, even though such a cut is justifiable economically.13.       I therefore favour, but only to secure agreement amongourselves on a minimum award to comply with theLong-term Assurances, the simplest possible schedule of guaranteed prices, aimed at a severe cut in theprice of eggs and leaving everything else alone asfar as possible.     (On any award designed on a different basis, I should have to think again about the milk price).14.       I do not see how we can justify to the rest of the community,anything more than  3-jr millions and I do not see why inthe circumstances we should not be able to resist any demand for more from the National Farmers&apos; Unions.For an industry two-thirds of whose net income isprovided by subsidy, the maintenance of the guaranteed prices of all commodities except eggs seems veryreasonable treatment.15.      But I must emphasise that this is no occasion forbargaining.     We must be prepared from the start foran imposed settlement, and if we are to face this wemust make up our minds to it now and stand by our decision.     Our negotiators must know where they stand.16.       On the petrol issue, I am in no doubt at all.     We mustnot allow Price Review conventions to stop us proceeding on the assumption that the tax will have been removed by 1st June.     We should say that the Government hasstressed the temporary nature of the tax;  that since
we cannot name a date the best course atpresent is to ignore it for the farm year underdiscussion;  but that we promise adequatecompensation if the assumption is proved wrong.P. T.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.7th February, 1957.
