(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(57) 35 COPY NO.   ^fy14th February. 1957CABINETFARM PRICE review memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and FoodAs requested by the Cabinet on 11th February (C. C. (57) 10thConclusions, Minute I) I circulate a schedule of changes in price guarantees and production grants to make up an award of plus  8 millions in the total value of the guarantees.2.      In doing so, I would like to emphasise again that in my judgmentthe imposition of a schedule adding up to only plus  8 millions against a cost increase of  38 millions at the first price review after the announce-ment of our long-term assurances would be a serious mistake.    Theagricultural industry will test the sincerity of our intentions on the long-term assurances by our action at this first review;   and an imposed awardat the minimum on the first occasion will once again arouse their fears,re-create uncertainty, and provide effective ammunition for theiragitators who have for the present been silenced by the announcement ofthese assurances.D.H.A.Mlinistry of Agriculture, fisheries and Food, S. W. I.13th February, 1957.
