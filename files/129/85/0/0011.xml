(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government secret.(57) U25th January, 1957HOUSE OF COMMONS MEMBERS&apos; FUNDMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer my colleagues will recall that during the debate in the House on12th July, 1956 on Members&apos; pay much sympathy was expressed with theplight of some ex-Members.    The Government made it clear that it was prepared to consider the possibility of an Exchequer contribution to theFund if this were necessary to permit an increase in benefits to ex-Members.    In effect at the end of the debate the Trustees were invitedto submit proposals to that end.2.      There have since been discussions with the Trustees.    Thepresent maximum grants are:-Subject to 300 for ex-Members a total income limit of  375 180 for widows a total income limit of  255The Trustees would like to raise these limits as follows:-E&quot;or ex-Members Subject toa maximum grant of  500        an income limit of  650For Widowsa maximum grant of  300        an income limit of  4503.      If benefits of this order are to be paid the Fund&apos;s present resources,derived from Members1 contributions amounting to some  7,500 a year,would need to be increased by a grant of some  9,500 a year.    There ismuch to commend the improvements the Trustees have in mind, and Ipropose to announce to the House at an appropriate moment that,beginning in the financial year 1957-58, the Government proposes to make an Exchequer grant of  10,000 a year to the Fund.     I should make itclear that this would be a firm figure and that if later on there were anyquestion of further income being needed, the Trustees would have to look, at any rate in the first instance, to an increase in the Members&apos;contribution of  12 a year.COPY NO.CABINET
4.      In the 1956 Finance Act the law. was changed to allow the Members&apos;contribution to rank as relief for tax purposes.    As the law now standsgrants from the Fund do not count as income for tax purposes.     I thinkthat in future they should so count, and I propose to arrange this by asuitable clause in this year&apos;s Finance Bill.5.      Legislation will be needed to authorise a regular exchequer grant (though this year&apos;s grant will be made in advance of legislation),but there is every reason to believe that the proposals have the full support of the Trustees, and if the Bill is commended to the House equallyby the Government and the Trustees it should have a swift passage.P.T.Treasury Chambers, S. W;T.25th January, 1957.
