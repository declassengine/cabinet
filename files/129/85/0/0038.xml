(57) 3815th February, 1957CABINETSOMALILAND PROTECTORATE AND THE HORN OF africa note by the Secretary of the cabinet as instructed by the Cabinet (CM. (56) 70th Conclusions, Minute 4), Icirculate a report by officials on future policy in Somaliland and the Horn of Africa.(Signed) NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th February, 1957.51218
THE SOMALILAND PROTECTORATE AND THE HORN OF AFRICAREPORT BY OFFICIALSWe are confronted by two problems, the first an immediate and relativelylimited one, the second of a longer term and wider nature. The first problem relates to the difficulties which have arisen with Ethiopia over their failure to abide bythe terms of the 1954 Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement regarding the Haud and formerReserved Area of Ethiopia. The second problem concerns the whole future ofBritish interests in the Horn of Africa after 1960, when Somalia is due to achieveindependence. These two problems are inter-related, in the sense that the solutionof either of them depends to some extent on the solution of the other. But it isthe second problem which is, fundamentally, the more important; and it is tothat problem that this memorandum is primarily directed.The Territories InvolvedSomalia2. This is the former Italian Somaliland, now administered by Italy as a trust Territory and due to achieve independence in 1960. It already has a veryconsiderable measure of self-government, and the leaders of the dominant political party have as their aim the unification of all Somalis in a greater Somalia anaim which is supported by most Somalis everywhere. The ability of the indigenousadministration to govern the country effectively after 1960 and to maintain a real,as opposed to a nominal, independence is doubtful, especially in view of the extentto which they are likely to continue to be dependent on external financial andeconomic support. There is a considerable risk, therefore, that a power vacuumwill develop in this area after 1960, as a result of which either the Ethiopians orthe Egyptians will seize the opportunity to try to establish a position of paramountinfluence in Somalia. There is already evidence of steady Egyptian infiltrationinto the area by means of teachers and advisers, and Egyptian propaganda isvery active in Somalia. These factors combine with the growth of politicalconsciousness among the Somali peoples to create a danger (which could beaccentuated by propaganda playing on religious views, economic, needs, and anti-Colonialist sentiment) that Somalia may fall into the Egyptian orbit, or atleast into that of the neutralist Powers of the Bandung group. On the other hand,although the inhabitants of Somalia were opposed to our action in Egypt, therestill exists in Somalia a considerable fund of goodwill towards the british connection, dating from our wartime occupation of the territory.British Somaliland3. This is a British Protectorate, which we are entitled to occupy and to administer indefinitely. But it. presents a serious political and economic problem,in that the livelihood of its nomadic inhabitants depends substantially on theirenjoying access to the Haud and the Reserved Area, which were recognised by-the 1897 Treaty as forming part of Ethiopia. At present about half of the protectorate^ total population of some 600,000 spend a large part of each year in these areas. The rights of the tribes to graze and water in Ethiopia were established and recognised by the 1897 Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty. By the 1954Agreement the sovereignty of Ethiopia over the Haud and Reserved Area wasreaffirmed, while at the same time the tribes&quot;1 grazing rights were confirmed, andthe Ethiopian Government agreed that the tribal organisation set up by the protectorate Government should continue to function when the tribes are in theHaud and Reserved Area, a liaison organisation being established to preserve the link between the tribes and the Protectorate Government and to transmit tothe tribes the instructions of that Government on internal tribal matters. in contravention of this Agreement, however, the Ethiopian authorities have put pressure on, and have interfered with, the tribes from the Protectorate, this process, if continued, is liable to lead to the subversion of the allegiance of thosetribes to the British Government. If this happened, the Ethiopians would be able(under the &quot; reciprocal rights &quot; article of the 1954 Agreement) to penetrate the protectorate by claiming, in regard to the subverted tribes, the same rights whichthe Agreement gives to us over our tribes in the Haud and the Reserved Area.4. But it is more likely, that the Protectorate tribes would refuse to acceptEthiopian sovereignty, and as a result would be deprived of the effective use ofthe Haud and the Reserved Area.   They would then constitute a very turbulent
2element in the Protectorate, even though provided with famine relief. already the Ethiopian pressure, both in these areas and in Ethiopia proper, has compelledour tribes during migrating periods to leave in the Protectorate a great numberof their more vulnerable members, such as women, children and aged people, th whose support.the Protectorate Government have to contribute at considerable expense to Her Majesty&apos;s Treasury.5. In either case our hold over the tribes would be weakened, and our efforts to foster their gradual political development towards self-government thwarted.Moreover, it must be recognised that, even if Ethiopia were to honour her obligations under the 1954 Agreement in full, this would not wholly satisfy theSomali tribes, who have always claimed that the Haud and the Reserved area are Somali territory. Their aspirations in this respect might be largely met ifEthiopia would revert to her pre-war practice of not administering the area, thoughbeing sovereign in it.  But there is no likelihood of her adopting this course.6. The recent events in the Middle East gave rise to considerable criticismin British Somaliland, particularly of what was regarded as our alliance withIsrael; but this,has now largely died down. British Somaliland tribes are bound,however, to be generally pro-Moslem in sentiment (though this does not by any means imply that they would necessarily be pro-Egyptian), and we must recognisethat any course which brought us into conflict with Moslem nationalism in this area would be bound to create difficulties for us in the Protectorate.Ethiopia  . .      - .....7. Ethiopia is a polygot kingdom containing peoples some of whom haveaffinities of race, religion and social habits with the Somalis. Although Ethiopia isstill in many respects backward and under-developed, internal consolidation and progress are likely to increase with the rise of the younger generation, some ofwhom were educated in this country. The Central Government have in the last tenyears considerably strengthened their control over the outlying provinces and are endeavouring to improve their administrative and financial services. Thisstrengthening of administration in the outlying provinces is, however, itself part ofthe cause of recent difficulties over the tribes which migrate from the SomalilandProtectorate to graze in two of these provinces.8. Ethiopia has a genuine security problem. She has in the past sufferedmany Moslem (including Somali) invasions. With her periphery so largelyinhabited by Moslems, she fears the dangers of Moslem encirclement: and, facedwith certain Italian and with possible British withdrawal from the area, she is determined to prevent Egypt filling the vacuum. Consequently, if, after Somaliaattained independence, Her Majesty&apos;s Government withdrew entirely from the protectorate, Ethiopia would probably attempt to establish her hegemony over allSomali territories. The absorption of this large area would admittedly place a great and depending on the reaction of Somalis perhaps insupportable strain uponEthiopian resources; but such a policy would be consistent with her previoushistory of expansionism during the past hundred years.The Ogaden9. The Ogaden is the Province of Ethiopia immediately to the south of the somali land Protectorate and to the west of Somalia, containing the Haud.Although it has been under Ethiopian sovereignty since its conquest in 1895, it has only been administered at all by Ethiopia since we evacuated it in 1948-49.10. If a Greater Somalia were created, the Somalis of Somalia and theBritish Protectorate would wish it to include the Ogaden, mainly because theinhabitants are Somalis closely related to the inhabitants of Somalia and the protectorate; and those inhabitants would probably wish for the same solution.The Ethiopians are violently opposed to any such development.French Somaliland11; This is a small territory, but it contains the important port of Jibuti, whichis the terminal of the railway from Addis Ababa. All the indications suggest thatthe French are determined to retain this territory, and will be very suspicious ofany solution of the problems of the area which involves any diminution of theirpresent rights.   The Ethiopians, on the other hand, would not tolerate the
possession of the port of Jibuti by a Somali Government; nor Could they allowSomali control of the areas through which the Jibuti-Addis Ababa railway runs,since that line will be vital to the Ethiopian economy for at least ten years to come.The Somalis would be equally opposed to Jibuti being owned by Ethiopia; thereis, however, reason to believe that they would not wish to press for its inclusion ina Greater Somalia, at least at first.The Northern Frontier Province of Kenya12. The eastern part of this Province, which marches with Somalia, isinhabited by Somalis tribally related to the neighbouring tribes of Somalia. It isa major interest of the Kenya Government both to defend the Northern and eastern frontiers against further encroachment by tribes from Somalia, and toprevent the Somali tribes already within the Province from encroaching, as theytend to, on the areas occupied by Bantu and European farmers to the South andby the non-Somali tribes to the west. If, however, the future Somali administration in Somalia were stable and friendly and would co-operate in preventing furtherencroachment of tribes across the Kenya border, the Kenya Government would beprepared to consider an adjustment of the boundary in favour of Somalia tofacilitate such control.British Interests in the Horn of AfricaOur interests in the Horn of Africa may be summarised as follows:  13. To honour our obligations to the Somalis in the Protectorate, i.e., our duty to assist their progressive constitutional and economic development, and, when wefinally leave the Protectorate, to bequeath to the succeeding Administration an orderly State and a contented people.14. The problem here turns almost entirely upon a settlement of the difficultieswhich have arisen in the Haud and Reserved Area. The prospect of the cession ofthese territories to the Protectorate (which would be the only real solution of theimmediate and limited problem) must be regarded as extremely remote. Butif the attempt is not made to deal with this problem before Somalia achievesindependence in 1960, there is some risk that the Somalis in the Protectorate may seek to take the territories themselves. Even with reinforcement from anindependent Somalia (assuming that Somalia could organise and finance thenecessary effort) the tribes would probably not succeed in that aim; but they could make it difficult and expensive for Ethiopia to hold the territories, and this situation would involve Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the extreme embarrassment, as wellas expense, of appearing to side with the Ethiopians against the Somalis. Solongas we remained in the Protectorate, we might be able to keep a movement of thiskind under control. But we should find increasing difficulty in doing so, and wouldhave to be prepared to face the heavy costs of effective military occupation.15. To preserve our strategic interests in the Horn of Africa-This is notmerely a question of the defence of Kenya (which marches with both Ethiopia andSomalia, and contains some 60,000 Somalis in its Northern Frontier Province)or the importance of insulating the area from unfriendly influences, particularlyEgyptian. It is even more, as the Chiefs of Staff have emphasised, a question ofover-flying and air staging rights in the Protectorate, together with the right to station forces, to secure concessions in respect of oil and mineral production andpipelines, and to safeguard the use and development of ports arid anchorages. Ofthese requirements the first is the most important. The Royal Navy&apos;s need tosecure port facilities would become actual only if we lost the facilities which we now enjoy in Aden. Equally, the possible need to station military, forces in thearea derives mainly from the prior need to preserve air staging and over-flyingrights in the Protectorate. Such rightsj including staging rights for, troop carriers,have become important ,for the reinforcement of the Persian Gulf, via Nairobiand Aden. Staging facilities might also be required for short-range aircraft,e.g., for the defence of Aden and the Aden Protectorate., 16. Indispensable to our full use of such facilities in the Protectorate is our need to enjoy, in addition, over-flying rights over cither Somalia or Ethiopia (andpossibly staging and emergency landing rights also). Somalia would offer a more direct route. But even if we obtained over-flying rights over Somalia (which is by no means certain), recent experience in the Middle East (e.g., Libya) shows that we
could not rely on a Moslem Government agreeing to our exercising those rights for operations against fellow Moslems in the Persian Gulf or elsewhere. Ethiopia,however, grants, us by treaty important over-flying rights (in exchange for reciprocalrights of over-flying the Protectorate); and the chances of our being able to exercisethese rights for operations in the Persian Gulf are reasonably good.17. As the range of aircraft increases, the importance Of air staging rights willbe correspondingly diminished; but on the assumption that our strategic policyin the Middle East as a whole remains unchanged, and that our interests in thePersian Gulf area continue to be substantial, we are likely to need these rights for at least the next ten years.18. To retain the friendship of a stable Ethiopia. As a traditional anti-Moslem and anti-Egyptian Power, Ethiopia offers a natural barrier to disruptiveforces from the Middle East, and to Communist Woe penetration up the Nile intoEast Africa. During the Suez crisis Ethiopia showed a surprising courage in supporting the 18-Power proposals, and the local reaction of the public was, onthe whole, sympathetic to our intervention in Egypt. Though often an awkwardand unco-operative neighbour for Kenya and the Protectorate, Ethiopia willprobably remain pro-Western in her foreign policy, so long as influences already at work to draw her into the &quot; neutralist&quot; bloc do not become predominant. Itis therefore in our interest that the influence of those forces within Ethiopia whichare friendly to Britain should be not only maintained but strengthened.19. To limit our financial commitments to the minimum. Given our economic prospects, the objectives listed above must be achieved with the smallestpossible outlay of money and resources. We have no alternative but to honour our normal obligations to British Somaliland so long as it remains a dependent territory.Apart from this, however, we must endeavour to ensure that others assume the major part of any additional or subsequent burdens.Recent Developments20. It is against this background that the Colonial Secretary proposed inhis memorandum, CP. (56) 180, of 25th July, 1956, that, as a solution to theproblems of this area as a whole, Her Majesty&apos;s Government should seek to revivethe idea of a Greater Somalia, launched and supported under Western auspices,and including from the outset Somalia, the Somaliland Protectorate and the ogaden. We were subsequently asked to consider this proposal and any other suggestions which might be put forward, and to make recommendations.21. Since CP. (56) 180 was written the following developments have occurred:-(a) The Ethiopian Government have agreed to local discussions about certaincrucial points in the interpretation of the 1954 Agreement concerningthe Haud and the Reserved Area. So far, however, these discussions have yielded no useful results and seem unlikely to do so.(b) The Emperor&apos;s recent speech at Gabredarre, in which the idea of federationbetween Somalia and Ethiopia was put forward, produced a sharp andhostile reaction from the Prime Minister of Somalia.(c) One of the consequences of recent events in the Middle East has been tomake it.even more important strategically that the United kingdom should retain the right to over-fly the Somaliland Protectorate,supplemented by a similar right in either Ethiopia (including the ogaden) or Somalia, together with the right to enjoy such stagingfacilities for aircraft as may continue to be necessary.(d) The attitude of other Western Powers to the future of the Horn of Africahas become more clear:  (i) France is strongly opposed to any concept of a Greater Somalia.(ii) The United States have expressed no definite view about thisconcept, but their sympathies are known to be, in general,pro-Ethiopian.(hi) Italian reactions differ as between the local administration inSomalia and the views of officials in Rome.  The former favour the proposal for a Greater Somalia, while the latter are inclined to view it with suspicion because they suspect it to be a pretext1      for maintaining British influence in another guise.
22. It is clear from paragraph 21(d) above that one of the most serious,features of the whole present situation is the complete absence among, the Western.Powers not only of a common policy for the Horn of Africa, but even of a commonappreciation of the underlying facts. The French, in particular, have alwaysbelieved and still believe, or profess to believe, that Somali nationalism has been deliberately encouraged by the United Kingdom for its own ends and would witheraway if that encouragement were withdrawn. As indicated above, these suspicionsof Britain are to some extent shared by the Italians; while the American attitude,if not actively distrustful, is at best unrealistic. The true position is that Somalinationalism, cannot be ignored or suppressed, that it will be given new impetus in1960 when Somalia achieves independence, and that present Ethiopian policy inthe Haud is playing into the hands of Egypt. We are convinced that it is anessential prerequisite of any successful future policy in the area that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should resolutely attempt to dispel the present ignorance and distrustof our motives and to evolve a co-ordinated Western approach to the problem,based on a recognition of these facts. So long as the Western countries remain at loggerheads on policy, any attempt on our part to make sense of the situation will fail, and the only result will be the consolidation of Egyptian influencethroughout the Horn of Africa-a result that will be equally serious for Westerninfluence and for Ethiopia.Possible Policies23. It is in the fight of these considerations that we have had to considerfuture policy in the Horn of Africa. We have been greatly assisted in doing so by having the opportunity to discuss the issues involved with Her Majesty&apos;ambassador in Addis Ababa, the Governor and Acting Chief Secretary of british somali land, and the Chief Secretary of Kenya. In the light of what they havetold us, two facts stand out very clearly:  (a) Ethiopia will undoubtedly continue to refuse to consider the cession ofany part of the territory which she at present controls, including the ogaden.(b) There are two objectives held by the Somali peoples, from which thereis little chance of diverting them. First, the British Somalis desireadequate and secure access to the Haud. Second, all Somalis desireunification in a Greater Somalia.24. Any new policy must take account of these irreconcilable facts. Inparticular, if it ignores the aspirations of the Somalis as summarised above, thereis a grave risk that, when Somalia becomes independent in 1960, the pressure forintegration of the Somali peoples will rapidly cause great difficulties for us in the protectorate. The price of maintaining our position would be considerably increased military commitments and consequent expenditure.25. If so, it is none too soon to formulate a new policy now, and to pursueit consistently and courageously in the next few years. Unfortunately, theirreconcilable ambitions of Ethiopia and the Somalis appear to rule out of courtcertain courses of action which, in different circumstances, might well have provided an adequate solution of the problem. The first of these solutions is the concept of a Greater Somalia, examined in CP. (56) 180. There is little doubt that aGreater Somalia, which embraced the Ogaden as well as the Protectorate andSomalia, would do much to satisfy the aspirations of the Somali peoples.Ethnically, it would constitute a more logical unit than the present patchwork ofSomali communities, divided by international boundaries. Economically, it wouldsolve the problem for the migratory tribes from the Protectorate, though it wouldnot of course increase the viability of the area as a whole. If the creation of aGreater Somalia of this kind could be so negotiated as to preserve our strategic interests in the area, it would constitute a solution which we also could welcome.But it is only too clear that if we expressed overt support for this project, the only result at the present time would be to alienate, so far as the area is concerned, thesympathies of the United States, Italy and France, as well as Ethiopia. Even onthe assumption, which we make elsewhere, that resolute attempts are made by her Majesty&apos;s Government in the first instance to improve the present attitude ofthe other Western Powers concerned, we have been reluctantly forced to the
conclusion that, at least for the time being, it is not practical politics actively tosponsor the creation of a Greater Somalia which includes the Ogaden.26. Much the same is true of the alternative solution at the other extreme,i.e., a solution which would seek to promote the fusion of the Protectorate andSomalia with Ethiopia, either by their wholesale absorption or by some other kindof federation, which, however much it might purport to be federation on equalterms, would in fact end in the Protectorate and Somalia being included in the ethiopian Empire. Any solution of this kind would be anathema to the Somalis,and would, therefore, be irreconcilable with our obligations to the Protectorate,besides earning us the continuing hostility of all Somali peoples. Moreover, it is unlikely that Ethiopia would be either able or willing to check the south-westerlydrive of the Somalis, with the result that they would be liable to expand into Kenya.In the long term, the defence of Kenya is liable to be less difficult if there are twoindependent,Powers on her north-eastern frontier than if there is only one. Forthese reasons a policy directed towards the fusion of Ethiopia and the Somalipeoples appears to be as impracticable in present circumstances as the creation ofa Greater Somalia including the Ogaden.A Short-Term Policy27. There remain, so far as we can see, only two other methods of approaching the problem. The first consists, at its simplest, of making the best ofthings as they are. On this hypothesis we should make a more or less simultaneousapproach to Ethiopia and to the Protectorate on the following lines. To Ethiopiawe would indicate that we have at present no intention of taking any new initiativeabout the future of the Somali territories beyond that contained in the deliberatelycautious statement in the Declaration of Policy by Lord Lloyd in May 1956 that&quot; Her Majesty&apos;s Government would certainly discuss any such proposals [i.e., forsome form of association between Somaliland and Somalia sometime after 1960]with representatives of the people of the Protectorate; and, if political and economicconditions were propitious and the proposals were both well-conceived andfavoured by the Somalis concerned, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be ready tosupport them in principle.&quot; But we should also make it clear to Ethiopia that itwill only be possible for us to continue to take this line if, on their side, the ethiopian: Government operate the 1954 Agreement fairly and honourably, and in:such a way as to make our Somalis feel that they will have secure access to theHaud and the Reserved Area without being forced to adopt Ethiopian nationalityor to accept leaders appointed by the Ethiopians.28. Such a statement would be, for Ethiopia, a fair offer and a clear warning.It would need&apos;to be accompanied by a parallel statement to the Somalis in the protectorate, in which we should emphasise that so far as we are concerned, theHaud is, and must Temain, Ethiopian territory, and that the Somalis will have no support from us in trying to acquire it for themselves; that their best interest would lie in a satisfactory working of the 1954 Agreement; that so long as they wish us toremain in the Protectorate, doing our best to operate the 1954 Agreement fairly forthem, we will be prepared to remain; that we will go when they want us to go;but that, if and when we go, our present subsidy will be continued (if at all) for onlya limited period to the successor State, and will then cease altogether.29. The advantage of this policy is that it is at least simple we should makeit clear to each party where we stood, and we should make a new and honestattempt to persuade them both to behave, reasonably. Its disadvantage is that itmight achieve no more than have previous attempts to induce Ethiopia and the protectorate to live as good neighbours, in which case unrest in the ProtectorateWould be liable to increase still further. Moreover, even if these tactics succeededfor the time being in re-establishing a more harmonious situation in the Haud, theywould contribute little, if anything, to the solution of the long-term problem whichwill arise when Somalia. achieves independence in 1960. The terms of ourstatement to the Protectorate would necessarily become known, and both the somalis and Ethiopia^ to say nothing of other.potentially interested Powers suchas Egypt-would realise that,they could make life,very difficult for us in the protectorate, leading once again to greatly increased military commitments andexpenditure. . .JA Long-Term Policy30. . The alternative policy would start from the hypothesis that we shouldbe wise to anticipate the situation which will arise in 1960, by making it clear
now that henceforward we are prepared to work actively towards the unificationwith an independent Somalia in the near future, of those Somali peoples overwhom we have some control, i.e., in effect the Somalis who live in the protectorate and in a part of the Northern Frontier Province of Kenya. If the Somalis had before them the prospect that, by 1960 or fairly soon thereafter, a Somali Statemight be in being comprising the Protectorate, Somalia and part of the northern frontier Province, they might be willing to accept this as sufficient evidence, forthe time being, of our goodwill towards their aspirations. They would doubtlessregard this as only the first step towards the creation of a genuine Greater Somalia,which would also include the Ogaden. We also might have this idea at the backof our minds; but there would be no need for us to say anything about it at themoment.31. By itself, this would not be enough. Such a State (besides being of apeculiar shape) would not be economically viable. It would need financial andeconomic support, with technical aid, and interests would have to be found able and willing to provide these. In addition, guarantees of access to the Haud wouldbe needed by the Somalis in the area of the present Protectorate.32. We might be able to persuade both the United States and Italy that it wasin their interests, as well as in ours, to ensure that, when we left the protectorate and Italy left Somalia, the whole of this important region did not lapse intobloodshed and disorder, and that they would be well advised to share with us thefinancial liability for the support of the new State in return for some assurances about the ability of the Western Powers to maintain adequate strategic facilities inthe area.33. The Americans would probably have to produce most of the money;and their readiness to see us maintain some strategic position in the Persian Gulfarea might make them look sympathetically on our need for strategic facilitiesnorthwards from East Africa (which the United Nations are not likely to favour).If the interests of the Americans could be engaged to this extent, they wouldprobably be quick to realise that there is no point in pouring more money into aState, a large part of which is deprived of adequate access to the one area ofpastoral land which is essential to a nomadic economy. They might thereforebe persuaded to bring pressure on Ethiopia to make the 1954 Agreement (or possibly a new multilateral agreement) work in a reasonable manner. There is,of course, the risk that Ethiopia would take this opportunity not merely to repudiate the 1954 Agreement but also to refuse to concede any substitute for it without some modification of its terms to her own advantage. But it is arguablehow far she could take this line if the United States were actively committed tothe support of the new State in this respect.34. The United States might, however, feel that, although they would onlybe prepared to contribute financial assistance to the new State if a long-termsettlement of the Haud problem offered some prospect of a more stable economicexistence for the Somalis, this settlement was not something which they couldseek to promote themselves but was a problem to be referred to the United Nations.It would be easier for us to associate ourselves with a long-term solution of theproblems of the Horn of Africa under the aegis of the United Nations if we had first declared our intention of leaving the Somaliland Protectorate. It would haveto be recognised, however, that such a solution might well involve the loss of our strategic rights in the Horn of Africa.35. The essence of a policy of the kind outlined in paragraphs 30-34 wouldbe that we should attempt to tackle the problem step by step, gradually easingourselves out of the Protectorate and gradually easing other people into some degreeof responsibility for the Somali peoples as a whole, in the hope that a lastingsolution would ultimately emerge as a result of a realisation by all the parties concerned that no financial assistance by itself would solve the problem unlessthe economics of life on the spot were so arranged as to make sense. The tacticswould need to be so devised as to preserve, as far as possible, our strategic rights in the area.36. The advantage of this policy is that it represents a positive approach to the problem an approach which would recognise our responsibility for the protectorate and our duty to leave stable conditions behind us when we eventuallyevacuate it, and an approach which might be thought to do justice to the
aspirations of the Somali peoples&apos; towards greater unity among themselves. Itsdisadvantages are that: ;(a) It would be unwelcome to Ethiopia; and our relations with the EthiopianEmpire might deteriorate as a result.(b) It would not necessarily ensure us our strategic facilities.  On the contrary,the enlarged Somalia might well have Bandung sympathies.(c) It would involve us in a permanent financial commitment (though this might be less than under any alternative arrangement).(d) Our approach to the Americans could not be kept secret; but if it became known, and if the Americans rejected it (as they might, under pressure from Ethiopia), our last state might be worse than our first in the sense that we should have gone further than in Lord Lloyd&apos;declaration towards openly adopting the unification of the Somalipeoples as our objective, but should at the same time have failed to achieve the concurrence and co-operation of the one Power whoseinfluence is probably indispensable if the policy is to have any chanceof success.37. These risks might be reduced to some extent if we had first firmlycommitted ourselves to a sustained policy of persuading Ethiopia and the protectorate to live together as reasonable neighbours on the lines indicated inparagraphs 27 and 28 above. If this policy did not succeed within a reasonable period we should be all the better placed to represent to the United States and toother countries that, since this policy was clearly not enough to produce a solutionBy itself, there was no real alternative to their associating themselves with us in a longer-term and more constructive policy as outlined in paragraphs 30-34 above,if the area was not to degenerate into bloodshed and if the important strategic interests of the West in the Horn of Africa were not to be endangered. It isimpossible to foretell whether the United States would then be prepared toco-operate with us on the lines suggested: but unless their interest can be actively engaged in the settlement of the area, it is difficult to find any alternative policyoffering any prospect of solving the problems which are already serious and willbecome progressively more acute as 1960 approaches.38. We must conclude by re-emphasising the need, to which we have referred in paragraph 22 above, for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to do their utmost, whicheverof these two courses they decide to adopt, to establish a co-ordinated Westernapproach to the problems of the Horn of Africa. As we have tried to show, the longer-term and more radical solution demands, first and foremost, the co-operationof the Americans; but we regard it as very important that the attempt should alsobe made to associate the French and the Italians with the policy and to present it tothem as a joint Western policy designed to protect joint Western interests. For thispurpose we think it would be necessary to make it clear to the French, and toother interested parties as and when the occasion demanded, that Jibuti (seeparagraph 11 above) would be outside the area of any enlarged Somali State tobe created under Western auspices. Whether even this assurance would secureFrench co-operation is doubtful; but even their reluctant acquiescence would bebetter than the certain obstruction which can be expected from them unless the attempt to associate them with the policy is made. The shorter-term policydescribed in paragraphs 27-28 above would not perhaps involve a prior approach to the Americans, the French and the Italians, but at least it would be necessary forHer Majesty&apos;s Government to explain fully to these Governments, at the time ofthe proposed approach to Ethiopia, the nature of the action being taken and thereasons for taking it. Otherwise the Ethiopians would merely appeal to the americans and the French, the latter&apos;s suspicions of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould be increased, and our last state would be worse than our first. Indeed, wethink it would be wise for Her Majesty&apos;s Government (particularly if, as suggestedin paragraph 37, the short-term policy were to be pursued as a prelude to the more radical solution) not only to inform the Americans and the French of the action being taken, but to invite their support in urging the Ethiopians to respect the 1954Agreement.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS39. In short there appear to be two practicable lines of policy towards theHorn of Africa:  (a) to make a sustained attempt to persuade the Ethiopians and the Somalisto  work  together,  especially in  implementing  loyally  the   1954.       agreement, and to persuade other Western Powers to join with us inthis attempt; or(h) actively to promote the union of the Somaliland Protectorate with anindependent Somalia in, or soon after, 1960.In paragraph 37 above we have suggested that the former of. these policiesmight in any case be pursued in the first instance, since, even if it were to fail, itwould be a useful prelude to the other alternative. If this course is approved, werecommend that the following immediate steps should be taken:-(i) Instructions should be sent to Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Addis Ababa,and to the Governor of British Somaliland, to speak to the ethiopian government and to the leaders in the Protectorate in the sense of paragraphs 27 and 28;(ii) Simultaneously Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington should be instructed to explain this policy to the United States Government withparticular reference to our desire to make the Haud Agreement work,and to explain our strategic requirements in the area with special reference to their bearing on the maintenance of our position in thePersian Gulf, the safeguarding of our oil supplies, and the stability of sterling. He should ask the United States Government to make a more active study of the problems described in this paper, and to sanction the appointment of a United States representative at Hargeisa;(iii) Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris should simultaneously inform theFrench Government, and should take up an offer which the FrenchGovernment have made to ask their Ethiopian friends to make theHaud Agreement work, in order to prevent Her Majesty&apos;s government from being compelled actively to sponsor a Greater Somalia policy;(iv) Simultaneously Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rome should explain our policy to the Italian Government.25 th January, 1957.
