COPY NO.CABINETLOCAL GOVERNMENT finance memorandum by the Minister of housing and Local Government and Minister for welsh affairs have revised the draft statement announcing the Governmentsbroad conclusions on the review of local government finance on the lines suggested by the Cabinet on 7th February ^C.O. (57) 9th Conclusions,Minute 2).   The revised version is attached.H.B.Ministry of Housing andLocal Government, S.W.18th February, -1957
REVIEW OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCERevised Draft Annqmoement of Broad conclusions the Government have completed their review of local government finance; and my Rt. Hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland andI are now ready to enter into discussions with the representatives oflocal authorities.   In making this announcement of the &quot;broad conclusions which we propose to put &quot;before the local authorities I am, at the requestof the Secretary of State, referring to Scotland as well as England andWales.2.   The Government1 s proposals for the reorganisation of local governmentin England and Wales, which have still to be discussed by the House, are designed to strengthen the local government system.   In doing this it isessential to improve the financial relationship between the centralgovernment and local authorities.   The ratio between Exchequer grants tolocal authorities and their revenue from local rates, which thirty years agowas 1 to 2, is now 6 to 5.   Not only has this remarkable shift reduced the financial independence of local authorities and their degree of direct responsibility to their own ratepayers; in addition, much of thisExchequer aid is on a percentage basis towards the expenditure incurred on specific services.   Percentage grants, whatever their merits, carrytwo disadvantages.   First, there may be danger of an excessive degree of detailed central supervision over the spending of the money.   Secondly,there is no certainty from year to year what the Exchequer may be calledupon to contribute.3.   I am sure that the greater the independence of local authorities inthe raising and the spending of their money, the better for the goodhealth of local government.   The Government, after a thorough investigation,do not think it practicable to devise a satisfactory new source of localrevenue.   Nor do they believe it right to transfer to local authorities the products of any of the taxes now levied nationally.   Rates are in thiscountry a well-established instrument of local taxation.   There are stillsome difficulties to be overcome in the rate system, but it provides a sound basis for local finance, and no better system of local taxation hasbeen propounded.4.   In 1929, when unemployment was widespread, it was decided in thelight of economic conditions as they then were to de-rate industry and freight-transport from 100 per cent to 25 per cent of net annual value.Against the radically different economic background of the present day the Government have thoroughly re-examined this matter, taking into accountall the arguments in both directions, and have decided that it is now rightto raise the rate contribution of industry and freight transport from25 per cent to 50 per cent.   In addition further changes will be made inthe system of pool payments to local authorities by the nationalised industries, including the direct rating of electricity properties andthe separate assessment of electricity and gas show-rooms used as shops,so that all payments now included in the pool are taken into account asrates; in Scotland the necessity for changes on these lines will notarise during the period up to 1961 for which the existing valuations arefrozen.5.   At the same time the Government intend a major recasting of thefinancial relationship between the Exchequer and local authorities.   Thiswill entail a radical revision of the structure of Exchequer grants, aswell as some adjustment of the grants to take aocount of the new rateincome.   With a few exceptions, where technical considerations make itimpossible, specific grants will be replaced by a general grant of anamount fixed in advance for a short period of years, though not necessarilyANNEX
at the same level for each year of the period.   This general grant will be distributed to all county and county borough councils in England andWales, and to county and town councils in Scotland, by reference toobjective factors (mainly of weighted population) which are readilyascertainable and afford a fair and reasonable measure of the relative needsof each authority.6.   With this change, local authorities will acquire a great increase ofresponsibility in determining the money to he spent on the various services,in accordance with local needs.   Local government will become more trulylocal.   Our aim is to foster and stimulate a vigorous and independentlocal government, and to give members of councils a greater incentive totake a lively interest in their local expenditure by placing much more of it under their own control.   Under the proposals the Government have in mind, the amount of general grant-in-aid, not tied in any way to individual services, will, at present levels of expenditure, rise fromless than one-sixth to close on two-thirds of the total Exchequer grants to local authorities.7.   It is also proposed to revise the system of Equalisation grants, onthe basis of recommendations made in 1953* including the payment of grantsdirect to county district councils.   In Scotland the arrangements forEqualisation grants were amended by the Act of 1954 and also by lastyear&apos;s Act, which provides that a further review must be held before 1963*8.   lily Put. Hon. Eriends the Secretary of State for Scotland and theMinister of Transport intend also to review the present system of Highwaygrants.9.   As far as practicable, it is the Governments intention to bring allthese changes into operation on a single date.   Some transitional grantarrangements for a period thereafter will naturally he needed.10. These proposals will be discussed with other organisationsaffected by them, in addition to the discussions to he held withrepresentatives of local authorities.   The intention of the Government isto introduce legislation as soon as practicable when these necessarydiscussions have been completed.
