secret.(57) 4526th February, 1957CABINETPARK LANE scheme memorandum by the Lord President of the council as I may not be able to be present when the paper by the ministers of Transport and Works (C. (57) 40) is discussed, there is one point whichI should like to put to my colleagues.2.      While I am in general agreement with the proposals in C.(57) 40,I should like to emphasise the need for making a quick start on the east-west underpass which, as paragraph 6 of that paper states, is likely to berequired in the near future.3.      The Road Research Laboratory of the Department of scientific and Industrial Research, who for some time have been among the expertsadvising on this project, have recently informed me that by July, 1956,the traffic flow at Hyde Park Corner had already increased above thefigure for 1954 by 13. 3 per cent.    I understand that the new roundaboutis designed to cater for an increase of 25-30 per cent above the 1954 trafficfigures.    Therefore, if traffic continues to increase at its pre-rationingrate - and there is no reason to suppose it will not - it would probably be only a little more than two years before the full capacity of the newroundabout would be needed.4.      I imagine that this major road reconstruction would in any casetake about two years.    It seems likely, therefore, that without the under-pass, the full capacity of the roundabout, might well be reached before itwas opened to traffic at all;   and from then on it would be increasinglyinadequate.     On these grounds, I am strongly advised by the road research Laboratory that the construction of the underpass ought to be started simultaneously with the reconstruction of Hyde Park Corner.5. I endorse this advice wholeheartedly, and I hope that my colleagues will agree.S.COPY NO,Privy Council Office, S.W.I.26th February, 1957.
