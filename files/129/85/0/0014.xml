secret copy NOCABINETNATIONAL jmOBmSS;    UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITMemorandum bv^jphe Minister of Labour and National Serviceand the Minister of Pensions and National insurance on 9th October, 1956 (CM. (56) 70th Conclusions, Minute 2)the- Cabinet, having considered proposals for changes in the unemploymentbenefit rates for short-time workers,(1)   Approved in principle the proposals in CP. (56) 213;(2)    invited the Minister of National Insurance to arrangefor a draft clause to be included in the national insurance Bill;(3)    agreed to resume their discussion of this question onthe basis of the draft Bill towards the end of the year.The first print of the National Instirance Bill includes a clause onthe subject and the Cabinet will now wish to consider the ma.tter furtherparticularly in its bearing on the atmosphere in which wage negotiations are now being conducted.2,     It is too early as yet to pronounce definitely upon the form which wage negotiations are likely to take in the next few months, asthe most important wage claims (e.g., engineering, shipbuilding,railways and coal) are still unsettled, but there are grounds for hoping that a reasonable restraint will be observed on the workers&apos; side provided the cost of living does not rise dramatically in the next month or two.There are therefore strong reasons for not introducing a controversialmeasure which might be interpreted in some quarters as a political measuredirected to vrorsening the position of workers whose earnings are alreadyseriously affected by short-time working and loss of overtime.     Moreover,in recent months employers have tended to discharge workers instead of putting them on short time and the need to check short time arrangements is not so strong.3.     In the circumstances we think that it would be inexpedient atpresent to press the first proposal in paragraph 6 of C.P. (56) 213(viz. that no benefit should be paid in any calendar week unless the\70rker is \inemployed in that week for two days on which he normally works)but we take the view that the second proposal (viz. that no benefit bepaid for a day on which the worker does not normally work unless he is wholly unemployed in that week) would not be open to the same objection,and should be proceeded with as removing at least the most obvious andglaring anomaly in the present position.   The effect would be that\Yorkers normally working a five-day week would if working three days gettwo days&apos; benefit, those working four days at most one day (if the pattern of short-time working were adjusted to meet continuity rules, asit mostly would be).   The proposition that benefit should not be paid fora day on which the claimant does not ordinarily work seems easy to defend.This amendment to the present Act, being included in a Bill other changesin which are in the direction of relaxations for insured persons, would still attract opposition but it might not be strongly pressed.
5 64*      This change would have the effect of producing a saving to theNational Insurance Fund of the greater part of the  2,600,000 verytentatively estimated in paragraph 8 of C.P. (56) 213 as being the totalpotential saving resulting from both changes together.I.M.J.A. B.-C.29th January, 1957
