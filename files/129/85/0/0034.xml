secret(57) 34COPY iNO13th February, 1957.CABINETREMUNERATION OF DOCTORS AND DENTISTSTHE SPECIAL PROBLEM OF THOSE ENGAGEDIN BASIC MEDICAL WORKMemorandum by the Lord President of the council I do not wish in any way to comment on the main purposes ofthe proposals in C.(57) 33 which do not come within my sphere andwith which I am in any case in general agreement.    But there is one aspect of this extremely difficult question about which I ought, I think,to utter a word of warning.     It relates to that basic research on which,ultimately, all clinical work depends.2.        The efficiency of the medical organisation in a country dependsnot only on the skill and knowledge of those directly concerned withtreating the sick, but also on the quality of the basic medical studiesand research on which clinical medicine rests.3.        Such basic studies are carried out outside the National health service in the preclinical departments of the universities and of theMedical Research Council.    If the quality of medicine as a whole is to bemaintained in this country it is essential that a due proportion of ablemen continue to be attracted to work in the basic medical field.4.        At the present time the gross discrepancy in remunerationbetween posts in the clinical field and posts in the basic studies is seriously discouraging the recruitment of able men to the latter.    Thisdiscrepancy arises, not frem any great difference in the basic salariesavailable in the two fields but from the system of Distinction Awards.To be eligible to receive one of these a man must hold a contract,paid or honorary - with the National Health Service.    This he can onlydo if he is engaged in clinical work.    As a result, under the presentsystem, the remuneration of a man in the clinical field may be nearlytwice that of a man of comparable distinction engaged in basic medicalwork in the preclinical field.    To give one example of how queerlythis works out in practice, it is a fact that one of the discoverers ofpenicillin, at present still actively engaged in research, is not eligiblefor a distinction award.5.        Unless this difference can be eliminated, the studies uponwhich medicine is based will undoubtedly be weakened, with seriouslong-term effects on medicine as a whole.     The question of extending the eligibility for Distinction Awards to those engaged in the preclinicalfields therefore urgently requires consideration.
6.        I recognise that it may not be possible, within the terms ofreference proposed, foi the Royal Commission on Medical Remunerationto make definite recommendations on this point:  for there must be some limitation to the sphere with which even a Royal Commission can usefully deal.    But, in that event, I hope that my colleagues will agreethat this matter must receive early attention in some other way.S.Privy Council Office, S. W. 1.,13th February, 1957.
