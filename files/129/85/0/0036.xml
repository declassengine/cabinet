The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No.C.(57) 3614th February, 1957CABINETY -NATIONAL HEALTH service memorandum by the Minister of Pensions and national insurance accept the conclusion in the report of officials, circulated withthe Chancellor of the Exchequers memorandum C.(57) 31, to the effectthat, assuming that a further contribution is to be made to the finances of the National Health Service by contributors to the National insurance fund, the only practicable method is to increase the value of the presentstamp and attach to it an indication that part of the cost of the national health Service is being financed from this source.     I entirely agreewith the Chancellor that the reasons for rejecting a separate stamp orcard are conclusive.2.      This method is, however, in present circumstances politicallythe most difficult to use by itself.     For the ordinary employedcontributor, who only sees his National Insurance card when he changesjobs, will, in general, only see the result of the change in an increasein the deduction already made from his pay in respect of his national insurance contribution.3.      The question, therefore, of the relationship between the timing of both the announcement and enactment of such proposals and of changesin National Insurance contributions and benefits, which is referred to inparagraph 5 of C.(57) 31, assumes increased importance.4.      It may assist my colleagues in coming to a conclusion on this issue if I set out the present position of the National Insurance Fund andof the benefits and contributions paid from and to it,5.      The outlook for the Fund on the present basis is set out inparagraph 4 of C. (57) 31.     Under present legislation the annual deficit on the Fund, which begins to run heavily into the red next year, fallson the Exchequer.    In addition, however, to the sums referred to inthat paragraph, the Exchequer is liable to contribute under the establishedformula an Exchequer contribution at an annual rate of approximately 95 millions a year.6.      As the Chancellor points out, pressure on the existing rates ofbenefit is high and rising.     This is particularly true of retirement pensions.     Outside Parliament, the various organisations of pensioners and their supporters are organising demonstrations and petitions andputting such pressure as they can on Members of Parliament.    They
have obtained a considerable volume of trade union support, including theScottish Trades Union Congress.    A considerable number of parliamentary questions are put each week and my own assessment is that pressurewill in any event rise considerably in the next few weeks.    My colleagues will appreciate the political dangers of a loss of initiative by us in thismatter to the Opposition.    There are at present 4^ million retirement pensioners;  next year there will be about 5 millions, and the figure will rise steadily thereafter.7.      On the merits of the matter, the present National Insurance retire-ment pension dates from 1946.     Its value then in terms of purchasingpower was bettered for the first time by our National Insurance Act, 1954,which brought the present rates into effect in April, 1955.     Subsequentrises in prices, however, have now reduced the current rates of benefit for the single person in terms of purchasing power to a level Is. 3d.below that of 1946, and 3s. 3d. below the real value to which we raisedit in April, 1955.    These calculations are based on the Index of B.etailPrices figure   for mid-December published in January.8.      These calculations take no account of the view now widely held that it is not sufficient merely to stand on the standards of 1946.    Thereis a strong view that pensioners, widows and the sick should have someshare in the improved standards which the great mass of the wage-earning population has achieved since that date.9.      The National Insurance benefit rates are also frequently judgedby their relationship to National Assistance rates, which are themselvesclosely related to the subsistence level.    The National Assistance scalerate for a single person is 40s. a week (i.e. , the same as the national insurance benefit rate) but plus an allowance for rent which, in thecase of a single householder, averages about 13s. a week.    Similarly,the Board&apos;s scales for children are higher than National Insurance plusfamily allowances for children.     \Vhile the Government, for reasons which are upheld by the Report of the Phillips Committee on the Economicand Financial Problems of the Provision for Old Age, have never acceptedan absolute relationship between subsistence and National insurance benefit levels they have, again for reasons supported by the PhillipsCommittee, recognised the need to watch closely the extent to whichNational Insurance pensioners have recourse to National Assistance.The number of retirement pensioners whose pensions require to be supplemented by National Assistance, which fell following the improve-ments in benefit rates in April, 1955, is now rising again.    this increase would be still more marked if, as may be the case, it becomes necessary to make a further increase in National Assistance rates.10.     Despite the facts set out in the four preceding paragraphs, Ithink there would be distinct advantages, if it proved to be possible, in holding the inevitable increase in National Insurance benefits and contributions to be effected by a Bill to be introduced next session.11.     It is, however, very much a matter of judgment, and of the fore-cast that one makes of the trend of prices, whether in any event thatwould prove possible.
12.     I think it is clear that an increase in the contributions paid withoutany accompanying increase in benefits would accentuate the pressure foran early improvement in National Insurance benefit rates.    The most effective argument with responsible opinion for deferment of an increasein benefits has been and is that such an increase must under a contributory scheme involve an increase in contributions.    Ifcontributions are in fact to be increased, though for another purpose, itseems to me evident that the argument will be raised, both on theproposed legislation and outside it, that if any contribution increase ispossible it should be used to finance an increase in National insurance benefits.13.     Of the alternatives posed, in paragraph 5 of the Chancellor&apos;s paper it therefore seems to me that the most advantageous course is tocarry through the legislation imposing an additional charge for the health Service and increasing National Insurance contributions and benefits at the same time.14.     On this basis it would be open to us either to enact bothprovisions in the spring or at the beginning of next session.    In thelight of present uncertainty as to price movements, there is something to be said for leaving that question open for the time being.15.     In the latter part of paragraph 5 of his paper, the Chancellorsets out possible objections to doing the two operations at the sametime.    As above indicated, there is no reason why, as suggested inhis (i), any delay should result if the decision of the Cabinet were toproceed with both measures earlier rather than later.     So far as (ii)is concerned, the effect on the Exchequer must depend on whether, asI would propose, the increase in contributions is larger than thatactuarially computed to correspond with the increased benefits.    Anumber of other factors working in differing directions (e.g. warpensions, tobacco tokens, National Assistance) would also have to betaken into account in assessing the effect on the Exchequer.    Withreference to (Hi), while I do not, for the reason mentioned above,necessarily accept the figure there given for the increased amount of contribution involved in the joint operation, I must point out that the combined increase in the stamp made in 1954 was 2s. for anemployed man and his employer.    I would add with reference to (iv)that I am bound to say that it does not seem to me to follow that theposition with respect to a separate Health Service contribution is inany way altered by timing its coming into existence to coincide withimprovements in the National Insurance scheme itself.    In either event,what the Chancellor describes as the essence of the original conception,that people using the Health Service should be required to pay more forthe same service, would be preserved.16.     Further to the question posed by the Chancellor&apos;s 5(iii), i. e., asto what is the acceptable increase in National Insurance contributions,I agree that this is very much a matter of judgment.     I am not sure,however, that two increases, spaced at the best a few months apart,would necessarily be more acceptable to contributors than a singleincrease.    And from our own point of view there is a good deal to besaid, before deciding finally on the increase to be exacted from thecontributor for National Health, for having in our minds also what boththe improved benefits under, and financial condition of, the national insurance Fund are going to cost him in the near future.
17.    I append.to this paper a summary of the main rates of national insurance contributions.     Politically, the most important figures arethe employee?s Class 1 contribution and the rate of Class 2 (self-employed) contribution.     For the sake of simplicity, I am not including a number of reduced rates for certain categories of insured persons,such as young people.Ministry of Pensions and national Insurance, W.C.2.13th February, 1957.
