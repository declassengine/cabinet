secret.(57) 24 COPY NO6th February, 1957CABINETLOCAL GOVERNMENT finance memorandum by the Minister of housing and Local Government and Minister for welsh affairs as invited by the Cabinet on 5th i1 ebruary (C.C.(57) 7thConclusions, Minute 2), I attach a draft statement announcing theGovernments broad conclusions on the review of local government finance.2. In winding up the Second Reading Debate on the Rating and valuation Bill on 7th February, it will suffice to hold the rather awkwardposition on this Bill if I simply say -&quot;The House well knows that the Governmenthave been undertaking a comprehensive review of localgovernment finance.   This is one of the subjects I havebeen studying since I was appointed to my present office a few weeks ago, and I shall be ready to make a state-ment to the House early next week upon it. &quot;3. I ask my colleagues to agree -(a) that a statement should be made on the lines of thedraft annexed; and(b) that T. be authorised to make this statement onMonday (preferably) or Tuesday next week.H.B.Ministry of Housing andLocal Government, S.W.1
REVIEW OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCEDraft Announcement of Broad conclusions the Government have completed their review of localgovernment finance; and my Rt. Hon. Friend the Secretary of State forScotland and I are now ready to enter into discussions with therepresentatives of local authorities.   In making this announcement of the broad conclusions which we propose to put before the local authoritiesI am, at the request of the Secretary of State, referring to Scotland aswell as England and vVales.2. The Governments proposals for the reorganisation of localgovernment in England and Wales, which have still to be discussed bythe House, are designed to secure stronger local units.   An essential part of this purpose is to improve the financial relationship between thecentral government and local authorities.   Grants from the Exchequer tolocal authorities and the proportion of local expenditure borne by grants,have over the past forty years so greatly increased that grants nowsubstantially exceed the total revenue from rates.   Much of thisExchequer aid is on a percentage basis towards the cost of specificservices.   The disadvantages of percentage grants are that there is no certainty from year to year what the Exchequer will contribute, and thatthere must be a considerable degree of central supervision over the spending of the money.3. I am sure that the greater the independence of local authoritiesin the raising and the spending of their money, the better for the goodhealth of local government.   But the Government, after a thorough inves-investigation, do not think it practicable to devise a new source of local revenue.Nor do they believe it proper and right to transfer to local authorities the product of any of the taxes now levied nationally.   Rates are in this country a well-established instrument of local taxation.   There are still some difficulties regarding the rate system to be overcome, but it provides a sound basis for local finance, and no better system of local taxation hasbeen propounded.4. The Governments immediate proposal is to re-rate industryand freight-transport to 50 per cent of the net annual value.     It is also proposed to make further changes in the system of pool payments tolocal authorities by the nationalised industries, including the directrating of electricity properties and of electricity and gas show-roomsused as shops, so that all payments now included in the pool are takeninto account as rates.     In Scotland the necessity for changes on theselines will not arise during the period up to 1961 for which the existingvaluations are frozen.5. The Government intend a major recasting of the financialrelationship between the Exchequer and local authorities.    This will entail a radical   revision of the structure of Exchequer grants, andsome adjustment of the grants to take account of the changes I have just mentioned.     Wherever practicable, specific grants will be replaced bya general grant of an amount fixed in advance for a short period of years,though not necessarily at the same level for each year of the period.This general grant will be distributed to all county and county borough councils in England and Wales, and to county and town councils inScotland, by reference to objective factors - mainly of weighted population -
which are readily ascertainable and afford a fair and reasonablemeasure of the relative needs of each authority.6. With this change, local authorities will themselves assume the major responsibility of determining the money to be spent on thevarious services.     On present figures of expenditure the amount ofgeneral grant in aid, not tied to particular services, will rise fromsomething less than 15 per cent to more than 60 per cent of the totalExchequer grants to local authorities.     With this change localauthorities will be able to examine their expenditure with a greatlyincreased sense of responsibility, because any savings they can make ontheir estimates for services covered by the general grant will enurewholly to their own benefit.7. It is proposed to revise the system of Equalisation grants,on the basis of recommendations made in 1953, including the payment of grants direct to county district councils.     In Scotland the arrangementsfor Equalisation grants were amended by the Act of 1954 and also bylast year&apos;s Act, which provides that a further review must be held before 1963.     My Rt. Hon. Friend the Minister of Transport intendsalso to arrange for a review of the Highway grants with a view to abetter system of distribution.8. As far as practicable, it is the Governments intention tobring all these changes into operation on a single date.    Sometransitional arrangements for a period thereafter will naturally be needed.9. These proposals will be discussed with other organisationsaffected by them, in addition to the discussions to be held withrepresentatives of local authorities.    The intention of the Governmentis to introduce legislation as soon as practicable when the necessarydiscussions have been completed.
