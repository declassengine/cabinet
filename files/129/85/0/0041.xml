The text of the Recommendation was presented to Parliament in Cmd. 9629. The annex to this Memorandum gives a summary of the provisions of the recommendation and the reasons for accepting it.2. Conventions and Recommendations of the International LabourConference are ratified or accepted on behalf of both Great Britain and NorthernIreland. The Minister of Labour of Northern Ireland has been consulted andconcurs in this proposal.3. It is the practice to inform Parliament of the Governments proposals on Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the International LabourConference. The usual practice is to present a White Paper. If the decision toaccept this Recommendation is approved, authority is sought for the issue of a white Paper which would state that the law and practice of the United kingdom is generally in accordance with the provisions of the Recommendation and thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government propose to accept it.I. M.Ministry of Labour and National Insurance, S.W. 1,19th February, 1957.AnnexRecommendation No. 99 concerning Vocational Rehabilitation of the Disabled1. The Recommendation states that, with the aim of meeting individualemployment needs and of using manpower resources to best advantage, vocationalrehabilitation services should be made available to all disabled persons who canbe prepared for, and have a reasonable prospect of securing and retaining, suitable employment. It lays down the principles which should govern the provision andadministrative organisation of such services and contains detailed provisions fortheir application.2. The provisions cover methods of giving vocational guidance, the principles to be followed in providing training, measures to increase employment opportunities and special placing and follow-up arrangements. For those disabled persons who, owing to the severity of their disability, are unlikely to be able totake their place in ordinary employment, there are to be special trainingarrangements, the provision of sheltered workshops and where necessary,arrangements for work to be done at home.51233
3. The Recommendation urges the organisation and development ofvocational rehabilitation services as a continuous and co-ordinated programme.It provides that there should he co-operation between the authorities responsiblefor medical treatment and those responsible for the vocational rehabilitation field,and, for disabled young persons, between the Education Authorities and theauthorities responsible for the vocational rehabilitation services. National andlocal Advisory Committees should be set up to help in the development of theservices. Disabled persons should be made aware of the services available andeverything should be done to ensure that they can take full advantage of them.4. In Great Britain the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act, 1944, and inNorthern Ireland the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act (Northern Ireland), 1945,give powers to provide comprehensive vocational rehabilitation services on thelines laid down in the Recommendation and these are in fact provided.5. One provision of the Recommendation requires that disabled persons(including those in receipt of disability pensions) should not as a result of theirdisability be discriminated against in respect of wages and other conditions ofemployment if their work is equal to that of non-disabled persons. The observance of this provision is not secured by legislation and it would&quot; be contrary to industrial relations policy for the Government so to regulate wages or to interfere with their determination by voluntary collective agreement. It is considered, however, thatthe provision can be accepted without reservation on the basis of current practice.It is observed in respect of the Government^ own employees, and it is applied in employment where wages are subject to statutory regulation. Moreover, inthose sectors of industry where wages and conditions are negotiated by freecollective bargaining the general practice is understood to be in accordance withthis paragraph, although in this field it is outside Government control.6. It is therefore proposed that the Recommendation should be acceptedon the basis that the law and practice in the United Kingdom are generally inconformity with its provisions.
