Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1957SECRETC. (57) 4021st February, 1957CABINETPARK LANE scheme memorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation and theMinister of WorksProlonged consideration has been given to proposals for the reconstruction of Marble Arch, Hyde Park Corner and Park Lane, and the question came beforethe Cabinet twice in 1955. We have now reached agreement on proposals whichwe recommend to our colleagues.2. The original scheme prepared by the London County Council (planattached), estimated to cost about  1 million, provided for the conversion of ParkLane into a one-way road going south, and the East Carriage Drive into a one-wayroad going north. A large roundabout was to be constructed at Hyde Park Cornerwhich would involve taking a small corner of the grounds at Buckingham Palaceoutside the inner wall and some Crown properties east of Apsley House. Therewas to be a small roundabout in Hamilton Gardens. A reorganisation of theroundabout arrangements at Marble Arch was also proposed. It was envisaged that in due course an under-pass might be necessary from east to west betweenPiccadilly and Knightsbridge.3. When this was considered by the Cabinet in October 1955 (CM. (55)34th Conclusions, Minute 4) it was suggested that there might be alternative ways of dealing with the problem which would be less open to objection than the L.C.C.scheme. Reference was made to the opposition of the Royal Fine Art Commissionto the scheme and the then Minister of Works suggested that if the removal of theDecimus Burton Screen could be entertained it might be possible to evolve analternative which would be less objectionable from an aesthetic point of view. TheCabinet asked for the matter to be further considered. There was no controversyabout the re-design of the roundabout at Marble Arch, and therefore no further reference is made to it in this paper.4. Since October 1955 exhaustive investigations have been made of alternative schemes. Some of the schemes involved the removal of the Decimus BurtonScreen, but enabled Hamilton Gardens to be preserved, others widened Park Lanein such a way that an East Carriage Drive could be kept free of heavy traffic withinthe Park.5. We are now convinced, having discussed the experts&apos; reports, that theoriginal scheme with certain modifications is the most satisfactory solution. Itwould cost some  2 million at present prices. There can be no doubt about theneed for a dual carriageway running north and south. The original schemeprovided for the northward carriageway to take the line of the existing EastCarriage Drive. The Minister of Works would like this carriageway to run as far to the east as possible in order to reduce the amount of park land surrendered. Hesees no need for a new East Carriage Drive inside the Park. He would prefer,having surrendered the minimum amount of land necessary for the new dualcarriageway, to keep all traffic out of this end of the Park and bring the grass up tothe line of the new railings. This would most effectively preserve the privacy and amenities of this part of the Park.Copy No. 6151225
6. All the experts are agreed in approving the roundabout as facilitating themovement of traffic;&apos;,;InvYie.w:;vhpweveri^Qf the fact that between 1954 and 1956there was a material increase in traffic, we must now regard the East-Westunder-pass, costing an extra  1 million, as likely to be required in the near future.This would unfortunately necessitate the destruction of some of the fine trees on,the northern edge of the Green Park. ; ij: u7. The Minister of Works, while recognising the need to make necessaryconcessions in order to facilitate traffic, is satisfied that this scheme reducesinterference with amenities to a minimum. The interference with HamiltonGardens is regrettable and it is also regrettable that the Wellington Monument,the Wellington Arch and some other memorials should be left in the middle of theproposed new roundabout, but with skilful architectural treatment for the scheme as a whole these and other disadvantages can no doubt be minimised.8. It has been ascertained informally that Her Majesty would agree to concede the corner of the Buckingham Palace gardens which this scheme requires, but itwould be necessary formally to take Her pleasure upon the subject.9. The Minister of Transport is bound by statute to consult the London and home Counties,Traffic Advisory Committee, and further advice of the Royal FineArt Commission should also be sought although their views will have to be balanced against the traffic requirements. To obtain powers to carry out thescheme it would be necessary for a hybrid bill to be introduced in the nextParliamentary; Session;,;;10. It is known to Parliament and the public that this scheme has been underconsideration by the Government for a long time. There will be strong criticism if a decision is not now speedily arrived at and put into effect. We hope therefore that our colleagues will agree that this scheme can now proceed. If our proposal is accepted in principle, a start can be made at once on the preliminary work.&apos; H. W.A. H. E. M.18th February, 1957
