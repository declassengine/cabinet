EXPORTS OF COPPER WIRE TO RUSSIAMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign AffairsFrom the point of view of our international relations and our defence interests, I find this question of copper wire exports verydifficult.2. It has a long history.   In 1954 we tried to persuade the americans to agree to remove the embargo on copper.   They refused  -but agreed most reluctantly to free copper wire, after we had told themthat it was extremely unlikely that exports of copper wire would be large enough to frustrate the embargo over copper itself.3. The current rate of Soviet imports of copper (mainly wire)now amounts to some 100,000 tons, 40,000 tons of which in 1956 wasaccounted for by our own exports of copper wire.4. The embargo on copper metal is indisputably being frustrated.I do not know what our current view on the importance of copper may be,but the United States Administration, on the military side and generally,certainly have the strongest feelings on the subject and they have askedfor expert talks.5. For this purpose they have tabled what at first sight is animpressive memorandum, which I understand is now under study in theMinistry of Defence.   This claims that Soviet production of copper hasbeen over-estimated and that Western imports have had the effect of assisting the Soviet bloc to meet its military requirements, in which they include &quot;military build-up&quot;.   It has been our argument in the past thatthe Russians would always see first to their military requirements. Piutthe memorandum argues that there must be a hard core of minimumindustrial, requirements with higher priorities than some segments of themilitary programme.   In general, I would have thought myself that theSoviet Government is probably now less able to disregard civilian require-ments than formerly.6. It is against this background of American concern, togetherwith some uneasiness which we are bound to feel about keeping theRussians supplied with a borderline item after their behaviour in hungary and the Middle East, that I expressed the view to the President of the Boardof Trade that we should not grant any more licences for the moment.COPY NO.CABINETSECRETC.(57) 266th February, 1957
7. If we grant a licence to Aberdare Cables for a further 10,000tons it will without doubt get known and cause much ill-will between us and all sections of the United States Administration.   It might be wiser to postpone a decision until after the talks for which the United states have now asked.S.Xj *Foreign Office, S.W.1.5th February, 1957
