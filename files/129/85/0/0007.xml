(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)secret.(57) 723rd January, 1957Q&apos;L SUPPLIESNote by the Secretary of the CabinetI circulate a report on oil supplies by the Economic PolicyCommittee.(Signed)  NORMAN BROOKCOPY NO. \3CABINETCabinet Office, S.W.1.23rd January, 1957
OIL SUPPLIESReport by the Economic Policy committee this morning the Economic Policy Committee considered amemorandum by the Minister of Power on oil supplies, which has nowbeen circulated as C.(57) 2.   The Committee endorsed what is said inthat paper about the present rationing arrangements generally and, inparticular, were glad to note that it now seems possible to avoid further restrictions oh industrial fuel oil consumption up to the end of March.2.    The Committee had, however, some discussion on the timing ofany announcement on the latter point.     It seemed to the Committeenecessary to take account of possible reactions in the rest of western europe, in Texas where the independent producers have refused toagree to the increased production for February which had been hoped,and among industry in this country.3.   Present information points to the possibility that commercialstocks of fuel oil are likely at present rates of consumption to be ata dangerously low level by the end of March in other European countries,which would not be able to rely, as can the United Kingdom, upon thesupport of massive naval stocks.    The Minister of Power is, however,endeavouring to secure a greater concentration on the production of fuel oil, as distinct from  petrol, by other European countries&apos;refineries.     We must be ready, therefore, to face the possibility ofsome protests from Europe when we announce our decision to maintainthe present level of industrial fuel consumption throughout March.It may be wise to allow the situation to develop a little further before making such an announcement.4.   The effect of the recent decision of the Texas RailroadCommission about allowable production for February should not be exaggerated:  the Commitee understood that even if increased production had been authorised to the fullest extent hoped, the resulting increasein oil supplies to Western Europe could have been no more than about per cent of ordinary consumption owing to limitations of tankeravailability.    None the less, the position is a regrettable  one, and theMinister of Power is consulting with the oil industry in this country tosee what steps might best be taken to secure a more favourable decision.Such action might be prejudiced by an immediate announcement of our ability to carry on with the present consumption levels in industry.5.   It is also important that industry should not relax its efforts to secure all possible economy in fuel oil consumption.     Industry hasalready been told that no increased cuts will be made in fuel oildeliveries  in February and it may, therefore, be wise to keep theprospects for March in suspense for a little longer.    On the otherhand, it is important that industry should have adequate notice of theGovernments intention so that proper planning can proceed.     On a balance of all the. above considerations the Committee concluded thatthe right time in which to make an announcement about the fuel oil position in March would be towards the end of the first week inFebruary.6.   Planning has been going on in the Departments concerned forthe measures which would be necessary in the event of our having to-1
impose a further fuel oil cut upon industry of the order of 25 or of40 per cent.    A restriction of the latter order would involvedifferential cuts upon particular industries, some of which would becrippling.     Fortunately, however, the prospect of any cuts of this order has now receded, and the Committee concluded that planning for any future restrictions which may be necessary, e. g. , beyond Marshould be concentrated on a 25 per cent cut and perhaps a cut of15 per cent which, after appropriate provision were made for vitalindustries (which should include steel), could be operated on a flat rate basis.7.    It would be salutary to refer to the existence of such furtherrationing schemes in any announcement regarding the level of fuel oil consumption for March.    The terms of this will be considered bythe Economic Policy Committee.23rd January, 1957.
