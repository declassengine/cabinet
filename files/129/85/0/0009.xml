Hammarskjoeld, on the grounds that the 1954 agreement was itself registered with the United. Nations. The text of the decree, ascommunicated to M. Hammarskjoeld, is attached at Annex A.2. The Law Officers of the Crown were asked whether Egypt was legallyentitled to abrogate this Agreement. Their views are at Annex B. They came to&quot; the definite conclusion that the bombing of Egyptian airfields, the destruction ofthe Egyptian Air Force and the invasion and occupation of Port Said by LiefMajestyV Forces constituted a repudiation of the Agreement.&quot; It thereforeappeared to them that &quot; on the 1st January, Egypt had the right to terminate the&apos;Agreement and .... the Decree of the 1st January constituted a lawful exercise ofthat right.&quot;3. Despite this categorical legal opinion, it might be contended that, for political or negotiating reasons, Her Majesty&apos;s Government should not admit the validity of the abrogation of the 1954 Agreement. The reasons for this might be-(a) a desire to resume our previous rights to the operation and maintenance ofthe installations of the Suez Canal Base; ,(b) a desire to regain the overflying, landing and servicing facilities in Egyptprovided under Article 7 of the Agreement to aircraft under Royal AirForce control;(c) a desire to regain possession of the British assets in the Suez Canal Base or compensation for them.4. It Will be noted that no mention has been made in paragraph 3 above ofArticle 8 of the Agreement, which contained assurances on freedom of navigationof the Suez Canal in accordance with the 1888 Convention. This consideration canbe left out of account since&quot; the Law Officers have advised that &quot;Article 8 of theAgreement imposed no new obligations &quot;and consequently that &quot;the terminationof the Agreement can have no effect on Egypt&apos;s obligations under the1888 Convention &quot; (see Annex B).5. The Ministry of Defence and the War Office are. a greed that no attempt should be made to resume our former rights to operate and maintain the military installations of the Suez Canal Base. The value of these installations depended upon adequate co-operation by the Egyptian Government^ which * for the foreseeable future, is not likely to be forthcoming. The strategic Value Of the Basehas, in any case, diminished with the development of modern weapons.  Moreover,51105
the installations of the Base have probably been damaged and some of their storesalmost certainly dispersed since 31st October, and the cost of putting the installations in order might be high; the expenditure so involved, together with thenormal expenditure upon the running of the Base, would be inconsistent with the pressing need to economise on defence expenditure. ,,6. The Air Ministry would like to regain overflying and staging rights inEgypt for aircraft under Royal Air Force control. But there seems no likelihood that the Egyptian Government could be prevailed upon to resume the furnishingof these facilities, at least not in the context of the 1954 Agreement.7. So far as Her Majesty&apos;s Governments property rights to the British assets in the Base (or to fair compensation for them) are concerned, the Law officers have advised that the termination of the Agreement &quot; cannot affect our title to anyinstallations or equipment ov/ned by us before the Agreement was made&quot; (see annex B). We have not been able so far to obtain from the Protecting Power any information about the present condition of the Base or of British assets in it, butthe Egyptian Government are known to have issued reports that equipment(especially vehicles) lost by the Egyptian Army in the Sinai campaign had been replaced from British equipment stored in the Base. In view of the advice of theLaw Officers, it would not seem that there is any need to dispute the validity ofthe abrogation of the 1954 Agreement in order to claim restitution of Her Majesty&apos;governments property in the Base or compensation for such of it as may havebeen misappropriated.8. A connected question is the future of the Suez Contractors Companiesestablished for the running of the Base. These companies still employ some 450British technicians who were in Egypt on 31st October and who returned to theUnited Kingdom after a period of internment by the Egyptian Government just before Christmas. It is for consideration whether:  (a) the remaining British staff of these companies from Egypt should now be discharged;(b) the companies should be wound up.9. There seems to be no advantage in further delaying the discharge of these450 employees. There is no work for them to do and no prospect of work. this consideration Would be reinforced if it is decided that we do not wish to resumeoperation and maintenance of the military installations in the Base, even in theunlikely event of the Egyptian Government permitting us to do so.10. It might be argued that to wind up the companies would be to acceptthe Egyptian act of abrogation and that the decision on winding-up must thereforedepend upon whether, for any reason, Her Majesty&apos;s Government might wish todispute the legality of the abrogation. But this argument is not a compelling one.The Agreement has de facto been abrogated, and the winding-up of the companiesis, in itself, only a recognition of this fact, which need not prejudice argument on her Majesty&apos;s Governments rights.11.   I therefore ask my colleagues to consider whether-(i) Her Majesty&apos;s Government should dispute the validity of the EgyptianGovernments abrogation of the 1954 Agreement;(ii) action should be taken through the Protecting Power to inform theEgyptian Government that Her Majesty&apos;s Government maintain their right to the ownership of British assets in the Base and will hold theEgyptian Government responsible for compensation for any such assets which may have been misappropriated;It is also for consideration by other Departments whether (hi) the. remaining British employees of the Suez Contractors Companies&apos;v former staffs in Egypt should now be discharged;(iv) the Suez Contractors Companies should be wound up as soon as their affairs can be settled.-&apos;&apos;^:-:-&apos;:\m- .

ANNEX ATRANSLATION OF EGYPTIAN DECREE OF 1st JANUARY, 1957,CONCERNING THE ANGLO-EGYPTIAN AGREEMENT OF19th OCTOBER, 1954, REGARDING THE SUEZ CANAL BASE&quot; In the Name of the Nation:&quot;The President of the Republic:&quot; Having considered the Agreement concluded between the Government ofthe Republic of Egypt and, the Government of the United Kingdom of GreatBritain and Northern Ireland, signed in Cairo on 19th October, 1954;&quot;and having considered the United Nations Resolutions adopted on 2nd, 4th and 7th November, 1956, in connection with the Anglo-French-Israeliaggression on Egyptian territory;&quot; and upon the recommendation of the Egyptian State Council;&quot;and in view of the fact that the said aggression must be considered as a violation of the aforementioned Agreement;&quot;and upon consideration of the views submitted to us by the Minister forForeign Affairs; . ,&quot; It has been decreed,&quot; Article 1: It has been established that the Government of the UnitedKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, by plotting the aggression, andby actually launching aggression against Egyptian territory jointly with Frenchand Israeli forces, and by attempting to invade the Suez Canal Zone on and after31st October, 1956, have acted as if the Agreement they concluded with theGovernment of the Republic of Egypt did not exist. It has also been established that the Agreement has been terminated as a result and from the date of thebeginning of the said aggression.&quot; Article 2 : In consequence, Decree No. 639 of 1954, establishing consent tothe said Agreement, the annexes thereto, letters exchanged and minutes agreedupon, is therefore annulled. The decree of the Council of Ministers issued on24th November, 1954, announcing the conclusion of the said Agreement and the annexes thereto is also annulled.&quot; Article 3: The Ministers are to enforce this decree, each in the part he isconcerned with.&quot;ANNEX BABROGATION OF THE ANGLO-EGYPTIAN AGREEMENT OF 1954Views of the Law Officers9th January, 1957.The Solicitor-General and I have carefully considered your letter of the4th January* about the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement of 1954 in which you asked forour advice on the following questions:  (1) Whether Egypt was legally entitled to abrogate the Agreement as shepurported to do on January 1, 1957. ;(2) If not, whether the action taken by Egypt gave Her Majesty&apos;s government unilateral right to terminate it.(3) What would be the effect of termination of the Agreement on Egypfsobligations under the 1888 Suez Canal Convention.(4) What would be the effect of termination of the Agreement on the property,rights and interests of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the Suez CanalBase. r&apos;:&apos;-&apos; -* Not printed.
On the view which we take of the matter the answer to the first of thesequestions depends on whether our armed attack on Egypt amounted to repudiationof the Agreement by the United Kingdom and, if it did, whether the Egyptian decreeof the 1st January amounted to an acceptance of that repudiation., The main purposes of the Agreement were (1) to secure that, in return for thewithdrawal of Her Majesty&apos;s Forces, the United Kingdom should have the right toreoccupy the Suez Canal Base in the event (of armed attack on one of the arab league States or Turkey by an &quot; outside Power,&quot; i.e., a State other than the UnitedKingdom, the Arab League States, Turkey and Israel: and (2) to secure themaintenance of the Base for that purpose.The Agreement thus gave us a limited right, which we would not otherwise have possessed, of stationing forces in Egypt. In our opinion the attack on Egypt,which was carried but in pursuance of an ultimatum requesting Egypt td accepttemporary occupation of &quot; key positions at Port Said, Ismailia and Suez,&quot;constituted a repudiation of the Agreement. That attack was in our view whollyinconsistent with the continued operation of the Agreement arid the exercise by theUnited Kingdom of the rights obtained by the Agreement. In so far as Franceparticipated in the attack, it was an attack by ah &quot; outside Power &quot; within themeaning of Article 4, and so an attack which would bring that Article into operation.The United Kingdom&apos;s participation in the attack was wholly inconsistent with,the exercise of the right given by that Article and indeed with the continuedoperation of Articles 3, 5, 9 and 11. Further it can scarcely be supposed that egypt remained liable under Article 7 of the Treaty to afford &quot; over-flying, landingand servicing facilities &quot; for the flights of aircraft which were dropping bombs on her airfields.We have therefore come to the definite conclusion that the bombing of egyptian airfields, the destruction of the Egyptian Air Force and the invasion and occupation of Port Said by Her Majesty&apos;s Forces constituted a repudiation of theAgreement. It might be held that the ultimatum of 30th October itself amountedto a repudiation of the Agreement, but as the effect of our subsequent acts appearsto us to be so clear we do not think it necessary to express any opinion on that question.According to the information supplied to us Egypt did not at any time betweenthe 31st October and the 31st December take any action which could be regarded asan affirmation of the Agreement and, in the circumstances which prevailed during that period, the delay of two months in accepting the repudiation cannot beregarded as unreasonable. It appears to us, therefore, that oh the 1st JanuaryEgypt had the right to terminate the Agreement and we are of the opinion that thedecree of the 1st January constituted a lawful exercise of that right.The second of your questions does not therefore arise.In our view Article 8 of the Agreement imposed no new obligations; it wasa reaffirmatibn of the 1888 Convention. It follows that the termination of theAgreement can have no effect on Egypfs obligations under the 1888 Convention.I am not quite clear what is meant by the reference in the fourth of yourquestions to the &quot; rights and interests &quot; of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the Base.I think we can best answer this question by saying that, as the Agreement does notappear to confer on the United Kingdom any title to property, its terminationcannot affect our title to any installations or equipment owned by us before theAgreement was made. Its termination will of course extinguish all our otherrights (such as, to take one exarnple, those conferred by Article 9 (a)) in relationto the Base.On the view which we take it is unnecessary to express any opinion on thequestion whether the Anglo-French attack on Egypt constituted a war arid, if it did,whether the Treaty was automatically terminated by it. I thirik I should, however,point out that, if it were held that the Treaty had been terminated in this manner,it might be necessary to reconsider the answer we have given to the fourth of yourquestions.Finally, we feel that we should draw attention to the fact that if the &quot; armedconflict&quot; in which we engaged amounted to war, the United Kingdom would appearto have committed breaches of Articles IV and V of the 1888 Convention by: invading and occupying Port Said. We have not been asked to advise Oil this aspect or upon the possible consequences in connection with oUr right of free passage through the Canal should breaches of those Articles be established/ i
