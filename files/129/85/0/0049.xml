Printed for the Cabinet. February 1957CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.C. (57) 4928th February, 1957CABINETCYPRUS AND THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY organisation memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Political Committee of the United Nations have unanimously adopted the compromise resolution on Cyprus and it seems fairly certain that this will be confirmed in plenary. This is a reasonably satisfactory outcome from our pointof view but it clearly represents no real progress towards a solution.2. We therefore have to consider the offer of Lord Ismay, the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), to use his good offices for conciliation in accordance with the resolution on the peaceful settlement of disputes which was adopted by the North Atlantic Council last December.3. We are bound by this resolution which resulted from the Wise Men&apos;sreport. The Greeks earlier made a reservation in the North Atlantic Council thatthe resolution should not apply to Cyprus, but since appear to have changed theirmind. I think that there is a general feeling among our Western allies that NATOshould now take a hand. My colleagues will remember that at our last meetingI mentioned that this was the view of Mr. Pearson, the Canadian Minister for external Affairs (C.C. (57) 13th Conclusions, Minute 4). I consider therefore that to preserve the goodwill of our NATO allies we should not appear tooreluctant.4. There are of course risks involved in allowing NATO to involve itself inthis problem. It will impose an additional strain on the Alliance and couldconceivably lead to the defection of Greece, or even of Turkey, if the solutionrecommended by the Council did not satisfy them. There is also the risk of a recommendation which would not be wholly palatable to us. But if we were ableto make positive proposals ourselves to any good offices group which might beset up as a result of the Secretary-GeneraFs initiative, I would hope that we shouldbe able to steer their activities in the direction we desire and so eliminate thedanger of an unfavourable result.5. I think therefore that there would be advantages in supporting this initiative, particularly while Lord Ismay is still Secretary-General, since he wouldbe more likely to get a conciliation group to work on a sound basis.6.   I therefore propose to answer Lord Ismay&apos;s approach affirmatively.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W. I,27th February, 1957.51263
