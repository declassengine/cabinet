(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE property  OF HER BRTTANN1C MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(57) 46 COPY NO.OOZ6th February, 1957CABINETNORTHERN IRE-LAND AGRICULTURAL grant memorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department and jbord Privy SealFor the past three years a lump sum grant has been paid to theGovernment of Northern Ireland for disbursement unrler special schemes,as partial compensation to Northern Irish farmers for their remotenessfrom their main market in Great Britain.    This arrangement is not entirely satisfactory.    It involves tiresome arguments about the amountof the grant; the uncertainties attendant on annual negotiation have ledto difficulties in administering the grant; and the lump sum has to becarried under temporary legislation on the votes of the Government ofNorthern Ireland, with a corresponding abatement in the imperial contribution which that Government makes to the Exchequer:  this ispolitically objectionable.2. Possible alternatives to this scheme have been examined by officials, and after prolonged discussions the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister ofAgriculture and I agreed on certain modifications in the present arrangements.   As a result, I have secured the agreement of theGovernment of Northern Ireland to a revised scheme, which I now reportto the Cabinet.3. Under these new arrangements the annual payment will be fixed in advance for the next five years, the size of the payment thereafter tobe settled after a review in the fourth year.   The payment will be borne on the votes of the Ministry of Agriculture, entailing a corresponding increase in the amount of Northern Ireland&apos;s Imperial Contribution.The grant will continue to be spent on special schemes for which theGovernment of Northern Ireland will be responsible.   The new arrange-ments, which require legislation, will be brought into operation at thebeginning of the next financial year.4. The annual payment to be made during the first five yearsworking of this scheme has been settled at  1 million.   This compares with a grant for the current year of  1,133,000.   The lower sum is justified primarily on the ground that Northern Ireland are now, for thefirst time, being given a fixed grant on the basis of which they will beable to plan ahead with reasonable confidence that the improvement schemon which the money is spent will not be interrupted.
R.A.B.Home Office, S.W.1.26th I ebruary, 1957(i)  to take note of the new arrangements for providing special assistance to agriculture in Northern Ireland;(ii)  to authorise the inclusion in the forthcoming AgricultureBill of a provision to enable the annual payment to theGovernment of Northern Ireland for agriculture to beborne on the votes of the Ministry of Agriculture.
