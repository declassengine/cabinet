/ A(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(57) 8 COPY NO. ?QO24th January, 1957CABINETLIBYAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for the information of my colleagues a report on thediscussions which were held with the United States delegation on15th-17th January in the light of the conclusions reached by the Cabineton 15th January (C.C.(57) 1st Conclusions, Minute 2).    The report canbe summarised as follows:-(a) the United States delegation attached great importanceto the United Kingdom continuing to contribute substantially to the combined effort to keep Libyawith the West;(b) they had no authority to mention any figure for theUnited States contribution but gave the impression that ample funds would be available;(c) they feared that a United Kingdom contribution ofthe order mentioned by the United kingdom delegation ( 1 million annually for developmenttogether with  1. 25 millions over five years forthe capital costs of expanding the Libyan Army)would land Her Majesty&apos;s Government in serious difficulties with the Libyan Government and urgedthat every effort should be made to increase thesefigures as much as possible;(d) they favoured the United States gradually taking over the Libyan Army and the United Kingdomconcentrating on the general Budget deficit;(e) the United Kingdom delegation emphasised that theyhad no Ministerial authority to give any firmfinancial commitments at present.    They couldonly take note of the request referred to in(c) above;(f) they would prefer that the United Kingdom contribu-tion should be concentrated on development projects.     They urged a joint assessment of libya&apos;s capacity for development on the spot;-1-
(g)subject to (e) above, it was for consideration whether,if the United States took over the Libyan Army,the sums mentioned in connection with the capital costs of expansion could be made available forother purposes;(h)it was agreed that exchanges should continue betweenthe Foreign Office and the United States embassy in London.   ,S.L.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.23rd January, 1957.LIBYAReport on the Discussions with the United States Delegation15th - 17th January, 1957The United Kingdom position the United Kingdom delegation were guided by the cabinet conclusions of 15th January, 1957.    Since Ministers had named nofigure for the level of aid to be granted to Libya after 1958, the delegation made it plain that any figures which they quoted must beregarded purely as Departmental thinking, subject to subsequent decision by Ministers.     It was also made clear, however, that the United Statesmust not expect the Ministers would raise these figures in any significant way.2.      A review of the United Kingdom&apos;s commitments overseas had shown that we should be obliged to make heavy economies in our financial expenditure, and our military establishments.    So far as theUnited Kingdom&apos;s particular requirements were concerned, Libya couldnot be reckoned to stand high in the list.     We had seen from theexperience of recent months that we could not hope to use it as amilitary base for action against Arab States, and the Libyans were now asking us to give them a definite undertaking to that effect.The Libyan Government also wished us to reduce the number of our troops and to remove them from the big towns.    They had proposedthat these changes should be effected through a revision of the Treaty.From the Libyan side, therefore, there was a desire to reduce thefacilities which the United Kingdom enjoyed under the Treaty, and thiswas, in itself, good reason for reducing the aid which we gave to Libya.3.      Her Majesty&apos;s-Government had decided that they would in anycase have to reduce our military forces based on Libya, as part of thereduction in our total military establishment.    In the course of 1957
9 Pithe Army would be brought down from six to four major units, and by theend of 1958 only two major units would remain. The position thereafterwas uncertain;  the troops might be withdrawn altogether.4.      Under our financial agreement with the Libyan Government, her majesty&apos;s Government Were committed to making certain contributions to their economy up to 31st March, 1958;    Our contribution for thefollowing five years was a matter for negotiation.     Even if the questionof reduced facilities had not arisen our economic position would haveobliged Her Majesty&apos;s Government to make severe reduction in thelevel of aid.    Although in the judgment of the United Kingdom it was important to the Western interest as a whole that the friendship of Libyashould be retained, and that Libya should be encouraged to associateherself with her neighbours to the West and remain clear of Egyptianand Russian influence, the United Kingdom could not continue to bearher present burden in the Western interest.    Nor was it to the interestof the United States that she should ruin herself in trying to do so.5.      The measure of the financial problem that would arise after31st March, 1958 was given by the following figures:-(i)  In the year 1956-57 direct aid consisted of  1 million for economic development and  3 millions as abudgetary subvention.     Indirect aid arising from local expenditure by the British forces came to 6j millions, consisting of  4 millions from theArmy,  ^ million from the Air Force and 2 millions from the Service Works Programme.(ii)   In 1957-58 there would be direct aid consisting of 1 million for economic development and 3.25 millions for the budgetary subvention, and indirect aid from expenditure by the forces of 4^- millions, consisting of  3 millions from theArmy,  f million from the Royal Air Force and 1 million for works.(iii)  After 1958 direct aid would be of the order of  1 million a year, in addition to which the United kingdom would probably be prepared to find a sum ofabout  1.25 millions to provide equipment for an expanded Libyan Army.    Assuming that two unitsof the British Army remained, forces expenditurein local currency would provide indirect aid of 2. 5 millions, of which  1. 5 millions would comefrom the Army,  ^ million from the Royal AirForce and  -1 million from the Works Programme.The United Kingdom contribution from 1958 depended, of course,on the assumption that increased aid from the United States would be enough to keep the Libyan economy going and to secure the advantageof keeping Libya friendly to the West.     If that assumption wereincorrect, there would clearly be no point in making a British contribu-tion.
6.      The United States delegation had no authority to suggest figuresfor an increased contribution from their side.     Their main purpose incoming to London was to hear what the United Kingdom proposed to do.They expressed concern at the extent of the cuts in financial support which the United Kingdom proposed to make, and hoped that when thefinal decision was taken by Her Majesty&apos;s Government this would raisethe figure quoted by the United Kingdom delegation.    A telegram from washington, received in the course of discussions, instructed them to urge this upon us.7.      It was clear, however, that the United States delegation had expected that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should ask the United states to take over most of the burden, and there were indications that, although they would continue to urge us to increase our proposed contributionssomewhat, it was not out of the question that they would fill the wholegap.     Their main interest was not so much in the amount of money which they would have to find, as in the way in which our severalcontributions should be allocated, with a view to Libyan reactions andthe convenience of the United States Administration.The expansion of the Libyan Army8.      The Libyans are determined to expand their Army, and it wasagreed that it was in the interest of the West that they should do so,since the Army provided the best guarantee of internal stability.A minute agreed by the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister of libya on 29th July, 1956, contained an undertaking that the UnitedKingdom Government would give assistance towards the expansion ofthe Libyan Army,    The United Kingdom delegation felt that a figureof 5,000 to be reached by 1961 was reasonable.    The United States, fortheir part, were committed to equip and train 1,000 Libyans out of thetotal of, say, 5000.9.     It was agreed that if, as seemed inevitable given the proposedlevel of United Kingdom aid, the United States would have to undertake the responsibility for the annually recurring cost of an expanded Army,the Army would in time move over entirely to American equipment.The United Kingdom delegation was therefore doubtful whether theUnited Kingdom should proceed with the idea of providing equipment to the value of  1.25 millions, though it was for consideration whetherthis sum could be made available for other purposes.Libyan Development10.    In the course of the official talks the United Kingdom delegation was not able to make much headway with the Americans on thedesirability of a comprehensive review of development in Libya.     it seemed important to make such a review, in order to determine whetherthe Libyans were concentrating sufficiently on development projects which would produce income for the Libyan exchequer.    Outside the meetings, however, the leader of the United States delegation showedinterest in getting the International Monetary Fund to conduct a survey.The United Kingdom interest is to reach an agreed Anglo-Americanview on Libyan development.
11.     The United States delegation were told that the United kingdom would prefer their contribution to the Libyan economy to be directedmainly to development.The Libyan Air Force and Navy12.     Tt had been made clear to the Libyans that the United kingdom could not help them to establish an Air Force.13.    The United States delegation thought that, in order to provide theArmy with the necessary mobility, a small force of transport aeroplaneswas desirable.14.     It was agreed that a Libyan Navy was not to be recommended,but a small coastguard force might be useful.Budgetary Subvention15.     The United States delegation expressed the hope that the UnitedKingdom would be able to devote its contribution to the budgetarysubvention.    It appeared that this was the form of aid which gave mostdifficulty to the United States.     It was pointed out to them that thetotal United Kingdom contribution would fall far short of what was needed for a budgetary subvention, so that the United States would be faced with this problem in any case.Future Consultation16. It was agreed that exchanges should continue between the ForeignOffice and the United States Embassy in London.Assessment of the Position Reached17.     The United States will press the United Kingdom to raise thefigures for their contribution, but will almost certainly come forward with a larger contribution themselves, and might possibly cover thewhole of the gap if we stood firm on the figures already presented tothem.     They would probably be prepared to undertake the equipment and maintenance of the entire Libyan Army, and on the assumption that,the United Kingdom contribution is of the order of  1 million, it seems inevitable that we should agree to this.18.     The United States are concerned, however, about the Libyanreactions.     So far as the budgetary subvention is concerned, it is likely that the Libyan Government will not mind whether this comes from theUnited States or the United Kingdom, provided they get the money.The same may be true of economic development.     It is probable,however, that we shall run into some resistance in switching the Armyfrom British to United States equipment and training, and one of our major problems would then be to ensure, possibly by means of a joint anglo-United States mission, that the change was made with the leastdamage to our political relations with Libya and to the effectiveness of the Libyan Army as a military and security force.
