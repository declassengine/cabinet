secret.(57) 1830th January, 1957THE ANGLO-JORDAN treaty memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsNegotiations for the termination of the Anglo-Jordan Treaty are due to begin in Amman on 4th February.    They will be conducted byH. M. Ambassador with the assistance of representatives from theTreasury and the Service Departments.2.     Subject to the views of my colleagues, I propose to sendinstructions to H. M. Ambassador on the following lines.     I should, ofcourse, emphasise that the concessions I have suggested would only bemade if this became essential to secure a satisfactory agreement.Scope of Negotiations3.      We should aim to restrict the negotiations to the termination ofthe Anglo-Jordan Treaty of 1948 and to the settling of problems arisingimmediately therefrom.    If the Jordanians attempt to introduceadditional topics (e.g. the re-negotiation of the Financial Agreement ofMay, 1951 or the negotiation of further development loans) we should insist that these are matters which could be looked at if necessaryafter the central question of our Treaty relationship had been satisfactorily resolved.    The question of Jordan&apos;s continued membership of the sterling area should also be treated separately if possible.General considerations .    It should be our aim to negotiate the termination of the treaty in such a way as to avoid leaving a legacy of bitterness and rancourand to leave it open to us to continue to exert some influence in Jordanin the future.    Jordanian co-operation and good will are, morever,essential if we are to withdraw our forces and their equipment in good order, and to avoid an undignified scuttle.     On the other hand we must recognise the improbability of the Jordan Government ever being in aposition to pay in full for such equipment and installations as we are obliged to leave behind.     We can expect little more than an acknowlegement-ment of indebtedness with, perhaps, small repayments spread overseveral years.Principal United Kingdom ObjectivesCOPY NO. Q&amp;lCABINET5.      Our main objectives should be:-
(a) to get rid of our Treaty commitments in Jordan assoon as possible, and not later than 31st March(i. e. , the end of the financial year);  and to evacuate our forces as speedily as possible there-after, bearing in mind the requirement to safe-guard the removal of military stocks;(b) to remove or dispose of our military stocks and installations in Jordan with the minimum loss;and(c) to retain if possible over-flying and staging rightsthrough Jordan.British Hostages to Fortune in Jordan7. We have in Jordan extensive military stocks and valuable fixedinstallations as follows:-FixedInstallations StocksMillions MillionsArmy  0.5  7-8R.A.F.  4  4The figure of  7-8 millions excludes certain equipment in use by the jordan Arab Army which remains War Office property (paragraph 16(b)),and also the equipment of British Army troops in Jordan.Fixed Installations and Facilities8.      Under letter No. 9 annexed to the 1948 Treaty the Jordan Govern-ment bound itself, on the final evacuation of British forces, either &quot;totake over at a fair valuation, having regard to the use to which they havebeen put, any buildings, installations or permanent structures&quot;, or to&quot;afford such facilities as may reasonably be necessary to enable theGovernment of the United Kingdom to dispose thereof to the best advantage&quot;.     Our negotiations with the Jordan Government will be basedon this letter.     We must, however, recognise that there is very little prospect of the Jordanians being able or willing to pay in full for anyinstallations which they require or we may leave behind, and little prospect of private sale in situ.     It might be possible to set their obligations against the balance of the subsidy (see paragraph 20 below),but we may have to be content with a paper promise to pay over a long period.     We should therefore aim to remove as much of our fixedequipment and removable installations (e.g. prefabricated buildings) aswe can without wantonly denying to the Jordanians facilities for whichthey have a genuine need (e.g. the equipment at Amman airfieldnecessary for civil aviation purposes).Military Stocks9.      The removal or disposal of our extensive Army and R, A. F,stocks in Jordan presents severe practical problems.    Our aim shouldbe:-
(a) to remove from Jordan whatever is useful to us;(b) to sell to Jordan or Iraq such equipment as they want and are prepared to pay for;(c) to move to Iraq such equipment as is not disposedof under (a) and (b) above, either as part of aBritish contribution to a stock-pile in the bagdad pact area or as a gift to Iraq.    (The PrimeMinister of Iraq has repeatedly expressed thehope that our stocks of arms in Jordan will be moved into Iraq);(d) to leave behind in Jordan without payment as little as possible.10.    There will be difficulties in getting the Jordanians to accept such arrangements.    They tend to regard all our stocks in Jordan andparticularly those earmarked for the Jordan Arab  Army (value 2- 2-1 millions) as intended primarily for the defence of Jordan.     Theywill moreover be reluctant on political grounds to see any of them goto Iraq.    But they may well not be able or willing to pay for muchthemselves.11.     There is also a question of timing.    It will take considerable time to remove such stocks in Jordan as are not sold locally.    to clear stocks from Zerqa, Mafraq and Amman will take at least threemonths from the order to move, and stocks will have to wait at Aqabafor a further period, the length of which will depend on the availability of shipping.12.    It is therefore clear that we cannot withdraw in good orderunless the time limit is extended beyond the date of the termination ofthe Treaty.    This in turn will entail the retention of some british forces required for the removal of installations, stores and equipmentafter the termination of our Treaty commitments in Jordan.13.    In order to secure Jordanian agreement to this time-lag and tothe other arrangements for the removal of our stocks it may benecessary to make considerable concessions, and in particular to handover free of charge at least those stocks earmarked for the JordanArab Army, the paper value of which is between  2- 2-1 millions.     Ishould like authority to do so if, in consultation with my colleaguesprincipally concerned, I judge this essential.14.    In regard to the proposal for a stock-pile in Iraq (paragraph 9(c)above) it would of course be understood that it would consist only of equipment which is easy to maintain and which the Iraqis themselves donot wish to acquire.    The Defence Committee considered on 23rd Januarywith other recommendations for military support of the Bagdad Pact,a plan for the establishment of a stock-pile at Habbaniya at an initialcost of  300,000 for transportation, etc. and an annual maintenance costof  20,000.    The Committee decided to defer a decision until theCrown Prince of Iraq had returned from Washington.    Since some of thematerial for this stock-pile is at present in Jordan and will have to be
dispersed on the termination of the Treaty, we may find it convenient to put some of it into Iraq and tQ regard it as a stockpile for the bagdad pact, without prejudice to any decision on any further contributionff om this country.     I am sure that a stock-pile on the lines proposedis in the interests of the Bagdad Pact.     I therefore ask my colleagues to agree in principle, leaving the details to be worked out by theMinistry of Defence.Overflying and Staging Rights15.     We should try to obtain from the Jordanians overflying and, ifpossible, staging rights through Jordan for the R. A. F.    This need notentail the stationing of any R.A. F. personnel in Jordan.Other Points to be Settled16.    Other points which should be cleared up with the Jordanians inthe course of negotiation include:-(a) outstanding claims by British seconded and contractofficers who have sustained loss as a result of theabrupt termination of their employment with the jordan armed forces.    It may be possible to agreewith the Jordan Government to earmark a sum forthis purpose from any remaining instalments ofthe subsidy which it may be decided to pay;(b) British equipment in use by the Jordan Arab army which remains War Office property.     The originalcost of this equipment including tanks is estimatedat some  4 millions.     Its present value isappreciably less.    There is clearly no possibilityof this equipment being returned, although formalUnited Kingdom ownership of it might provide a useful bargaining counter.(c) the long-standing debt of some S.l\ millions owed bythe Arab Legion to the War Office for british equipment and ammunition taken by the Jordaniansduring the fighting with Israel in 1948.    Thesame considerations apply as in (b) above.(d) compensation for any equipment removed by theJordanians from Zerqa, Amman and Old Mafraqsince the temporary withdrawal of our forces.Loan of British Officers17.    The Jordanians may conceivably ask us to continue to provideBritish Army and R A.F. officers to advise on the training of their forces.     If they do, I suggest we should agree in principle.    In that event their terms of service would have to be more satisfactorilyguaranteed than hitherto.Future of the Subsidy18.    The Jordan Prime Minister has made it clear that financialassistance from Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria will not commence until 1st April, and that he is banking on the continuation of the British subsidy
until the end of the financial year.    Although we can argue that we arenot bound to pay any further sums from the subsidy since its total levelin the current year has never been agreed (and H. M. Ambassador hasmade this point to the Jordan Prime Minister), our legal case is notunassailable.    Moreover, if we wish to negotiate satisfactory arrange-ments for disposing of our valuable installations, equipment and stocks in Jordan, we should be unwise to stick to this position except at the outset of the negotiations.    I therefore recommend that we should beprepared to agree in the course of the negotiations to continue subsidypayments for the remainder of this financial year up to the total level ofthe subsidy paid last year.19.    We have at present an unexpended sum of somewhat less than 1,800,000.    But of this about  -1 million may have to be earmarked tomeet outstanding commitments to the Crown Agents and the War Office(e.g. rations for the Jordan Arab Army).    The Jordan Arab ArmyLiaison Office have already asked for the payment of  750,000 from theForeign Office and  150,000 from the War Office on 1st February or assoon after as possible.    These demands appear excessive.    i recommend, however, that we should be prepared in the course ofFebruary and again in March to pay suitably modified instalments fromthe subsidy.20.   An intermediate position would be to admit our obligation to paythe rest of this year&apos;s subsidy, but to insist that Jordanian obligationsshould be wholly or partly offset against these payments.    It seems doubtful, however, whether we shall secure Jordanian agreement tothis.Future Economic Aid21.    There is another question which the Jordanians may bring up inthe course of the negotiations and on which I should be grateful for mycolleagues&apos; views - the future of our economic aid for Jordan.H. M. Ambassador has recommended that if we wish to retain someinfluence in Jordan, the best way of doing so would be through thecontinued provision of economic aid.    This has so far been providedthrough interest-free development loans which are entirely independent of the Treaty.    We may therefore hope to avoid discussing this questionduring the Treaty negotiations.    On the other hand, we have lately with-held payments from the development loan on account of the uncertainty of the political situation.    The Jordanians have recently asked our intentions with regard to the future of these loans.    It is possibletherefore that they may try to inject this question into the discussions.22.    I think it would be in our general long-term interest in theMiddle East to maintain some foothold in Jordan.    On the other hand,now that Jordan has, on her own initiative, decided to terminate theBritish connection, there is no longer a case for giving her morefavourable treatment than other more friendly Middle East States.(The scale of our assistance this year was agreed to in the hope thatJordan would be induced to join the Bagdad Pact. )    In particular wemust be careful not to let it appear that Jordan&apos;s ingratitude is bringing in a better return than the loyalty of our allies in the Bagdad Pact.For this reason I do not think we can contemplate the continuation of our economic aid in its present form.    There are, however, two major projects - the Aqaba deep water port and the Desert Road from Amman
to Aqaba for which the Jordanians, with our agreement, have already-placed contracts, and which will take at least another two years tocomplete.     There is a case for arguing that we are already legally ormorally committed to finance these projects, the estimated total cost ofwhich is about  4-g millions, of which  630,000 has already been paid.If this argument were proved soundly based, continued payments toJordan would not appear as discrimination against our Bagdad Pactallies.    On the other hand, they might help to retain our foothold in jordan, although past experience of Jordanian &quot;gratitude&quot; is not veryencouraging.     We must also bear in mind the likelihood of criticismin view of the attitude which we are adopting towards economic aid fornewly emerging Commonwealth countries.     I recommend that we should give further consideration to the possibility of continued economic amdto Jordan when we know how the negotiations are going.23.    I should like to keep the Americans informed of the progress ofour ideas about future policy towards Jordan, including the provisionof economic aid.Summary of Recommendations24.    I accordingly ask my colleagues to agree that:-(a) We should aim to terminate the Anglo-Jordan Treatynot later than 31st March, seeking only to retainoverflying and staging rights (though not underR.A.F. management).(b) We should negotiate the take-over or disposal ofour fixed installations and facilities on the basisof Letter No. 9 annexed to the Treaty.(c) We should seek Jordanian agreement to some ofour forces remaining in Jordan after the date of termination, to cover the withdrawal of equip-ment, stores, etc.(d) We should aim to move to Iraq such equipment as they are prepared to buy or we are preparedto give them.(e) We should be prepared to make, from stocks in jordan, a United Kingdom contribution to aBagdad Pact stock-pile in Iraq.(f) We should be prepared, if the course of negotiations makes it essential, to make someor all of the following concessions:-(i)  Give Jordan that portion of our military stocks at Zerqa whichis earmarked for the JordanArab Army (estimated value 2- 2^r millions).
(ii)  Allow Jordan to retain, if necessarywithout payment, British equip-ment which is in use by the JordanArab Army (original cost:   some 4 millions).(iii)    Cancel the debt of some  1-f millions,owed by the Arab Legion to theWar Office for equipment taken bythe Jordanians during the fightingagainst Israel in 1948.(iv)    Accept a paper promise to pay forinstallations taken over by the jordan Government.(g) We should agree in principle to provide british officers to advise on the training of Jordanforces if the Jordanians should request this,subject to the negotiation of satisfactory termsof service.(h) We should pay instalments from the subsidy for february and March up to the same total as last year, subject to any offsets againstJordanian obligations that it is possible toobtain.(i) Subject to the satisfactory outcome of negotiationsfor the termination of the Treaty, we should give further consideration to the question of assistancein financing the completion of the two major development projects (the Aqaba deep waterport and the Desert Road).S.
