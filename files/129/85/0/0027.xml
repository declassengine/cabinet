secret.(57) 27 copy NO. JJ7th February, 1957CABINETWELSH affairs memorandum by the Minister of housing and Local Government and Ministerfor Welsh affairs there is no doubt that the Welsh will be closely watching - as indeed they have every right to do - the practical working of the new arrangement whereby the Minister of Housing has been made alsoMinister for Welsh Affairs, especially now that the Council for wales have recommended the setting up of a wholly separate Department undera Secretary of State for Wales.2.       I am particularly anxious in these circumstances to let it beseen that I am observant of Welsh interests, and to guard against anyunlucky slip or omission which might involve the new Government incriticism unnecessarily.   It will greatly help to ensure against this if mycolleagues will be so kind as to bring to my notice, at as early a   stageas they can, any matters affecting their Departments which are liable togive rise to trouble in Wales and might result in the Welsh complainingthat the Minister for Welsh Affairs was failing to look after their national interests.3.       I well recognise that decisions will have to be taken from timeto time which the Welsh will not like.   Even here, however, if I can be told about them in time I may be able to make suggestions which,although they may not affect the decision itself, can make it easier forall of us to deal with complaints from the Principality.H.B.Ministry of Housing andLocal Government, S.W.I.7th February, 1957
