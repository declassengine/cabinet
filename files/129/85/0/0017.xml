NATIONAL HEALTH service memorandum by the Minister of HealthFollowing the discussion on the general economic situation in cabinet on 21st January (C.C.(57) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 3) I have had discussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequer about the HealthEstimates for 1957-58.   I realise the need for us all to do all we can in reducing Government expenditure.   It must be stressed, however, that the health Estimates have been subject to considerable cuts in successiveyears.   The proportion of the gross national product absorbed by theExchequer cost of the National Health Service has fallen from 3.26 per centin 1949-50 to 2.80 in 1955-56.   During the same period the percentage oftotal investment devoted to capital expenditure on the Service dropped from. 83 per cent to 0. 56 per cent.   Fuller details are appended.2. Furthermore, though next year&apos;s estimates for the national health Service forecast an increase   of  47 millions over this year&apos;estimate, only  10 millions of the increase can be attributed to improving the Service provided or to capital investment.   Most of the increase hasbeen due to general increases in salaries and wager, and in costs generally,and is therefore out of my control.3. For these reasons my predecessor was about to circulate to theCabinet a paper drawing attention to the plight of the National health service and advocating a policy of expansion in certain directions.4, It has so often been said that the National Health Service can bemaintained at its present level at much less cost. But the guillebaud committee, whose main conclusions the Government accepted only last year,came to the opposite conclusion.   They found that the Service was givingvalue for money and they did in fact recommend certain increases in expenditure, particularly on hospital building.5. I am personally convinced that immediate reductions in public expenditure in this field can only be made either by finding an alternativesource of income or by reducing or abandoning parts of the service.6. An increase in the contribution made to the cost of the national health Service from the National Insurance Fund is an attractive proposal which has the merit of being logical.   It was the original intention that theService should be financed partly on an insurance basis.   Today we havethe worst of both worlds; the public believe that they make a considerableCOPY NO.33CABINETSECRETC.(57) 1730th January, 1957
contribution through their weekly National Insurance payments, whereas in fact the proportionate size of this contribution has diminishedannually.   At present the Health Service is financed from four mainsources - the Exchequer, the rates, charges paid by patients and a contribution from the National Insurance Fund.   All save one have been subjected to heavy increases.   The only one which has not gone up inrelief of the others since 1948 is the contribution from the national insurance Fund.   A total increase of Is. in the weekly amount paid byemployer and employee together would bring in about  45 millions a yearand would therefore reduce the estimates by that amount.7. I promised to examine the possibility of abolishing the general dental Service either wholly or except for, say, the priority classes.Whilst I agree that in principle this would be preferable to a series ofirritating small cuts, it is open to grave objections -(i)  Legislation would be needed amending the National health service Act, 1946.   It would take time and be highly contro-versial.(ii)  There would be no quick saving.   We should have to givedentists three months1 notice of the end of their contracts.Courses of treatment being given to patients under theNational Health Service would have to be completed, oftentaking six months or more.(iii) While in a full year the saving would amount to some 35 millions (or, for the partial proposal,  20 millions)in 1957-58 for the reasons just given the saving might wellbe no more than a quarter of these sums.   This wouldprobably be further reduced because there would be a rushof patients booking courses of treatment when it became known that the service was to be abolished.(iv) We could not hope to avoid giving dentists the option to takeout their accrued superannuation rights.   This might involve liabilities of up to  20 millions or more during1957-58 and might well more than wipe out any savings inthat year.All this means that this highly controversial and retrogressive measure might bring nosaving in the first year.(v)   I am at present considering the report of a Committee underthe Chairmanship of Lord McNair which investigatedrecruitment to the dental profession.   The picture is alreadyan alarming one and I am sure that the effect of eithermeasure under review would be disastrous.   The effect on other professions, of what would undoubtedly be presented as a breach of faith, would be even more serious.(vi)  The effect on the dental health of the population would be bound to be affected, more working days would be lost through dental trouble and the insured population as awhole would be worse off in terms of dental benefitthan it was even under the old National Health InsuranceScheme.
8. T. therefore cannot believe that, despite the desire for economy,this would be a form of reduction in Government expenditure which wouldcommend itself to those who look for a progressive policy.   I began myexamination of this proposal in an objective manner but I find myselfstrongly opposed to it.   Not only would it fail to produce economies atthe vital time, but we would find it difficult to rebut the political charge that we were now beginning to dismantle the Health Service.9. Looking at other services for which I am responsible, apreferable alternative would be that the charge for welfare liquid milkshould be increased to half the current normal price (i. e. from l^d. to4d. a pint) with a corresponding increase in the price of National DriedMilk (from 10^d. to 2s.4d. a tin) and that the full cost should be charged for orange juice, vitamin tablets and cod liver oil.10. These proposals would produce an estimated saving for a full year of over  15 millions (for England and Wales) if consumption remained at its present level,and, if the consumption of welfare milk dropped by10 per cent, of  17^ millions.   This would seem a fair contribution from my Vote to the national need.An amending Order, subject to a negative resolution, would benecessary.   If a very early decision were taken and administrative arrangements could be put in hand at once, we should get most of a full year&apos;s saving in 1957-58.11. I hope that I shall not be pressed to go further than this.Moreover, I should hope to be able to preserve intact the Hospital building programme.   For many years hospitals have been the Cinderella&apos; ofall the Social Services, and now that we are at last able to make a modestand much heralded advance, to which we are fully committed, it isessential to show continued progress on at least this front.   At the sametime, if we are not to lose the voluntary service without which the service would break down, we must make reasonable provision for running costs.D.F.V.Ministry of Health, W.l.30th January, 1957
