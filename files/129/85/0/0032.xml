j -    114(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret. (57) 3213th February, 1957.CABINETRENT RESTRICTIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentand M nister for Welsh affairs on 24th October last the Cabinet agreed that the Rent Billshould provide for the immediate decontrol in one operation ofabout 800,000 houses and flats in Great Britain - 750,000 of them being in England and Wales, including about 200,000 in Greater London.(CM.(56) 73rd Conclusions, Minute 3).    A major factor in thisdecision was the conviction that the Government should be openlyseen in the Bill to be making a positive and substantial start on thefreeing of houses and the dismantling of rent control.2.      Our colleagues will be well aware that this decision to carry through a measure of immediate decontrol has given rise to considerable anxiety and criticism in those parts of the country principally affected(in the main, the large cities and their suburbs);   and much of the criticism is on the ground that the Government is hitting at its ownmiddle-class supporters.    The decontrol provisions are indeed,at the moment, the only major point of attack on the whole Bill&apos;;the reaction against the general rent increases of the lower-ratedhouses is likely to come later, in October and after, when the increasestake effect.3.      The result of decontrol is to deprive the tenant of all theprotection of the Rent Acts.    He loses not only the enjoyment of acontrolled rent, but also his security of tenure:  and, as the Bill now stands, he could be deprived of possession six months after the Billcomes into operation, i. e. , one month after Royal Assent.     It is thissudden threat to security of possession that has caused so muchdisquiet, above all in London where the general shortage of housing accommodation is still serious.4.      Various suggestions have been put forward for softeningthe impact of decontrol.    Two of these appear to have fairly widebacking, and each is examined in the annex to this paper.    Thedifficulty about them is that they both amount in effect to abandonment of decontrol for the time being - a direct negation of the cabinets decision of last autumn.5.      To retreat now on the principle of decontrol would, in ourview, be a profound mistake.     For the Government to have firstcommitted itself to a measure of decontrol, and then to go back on its decision although no new facts have emerged in the meantime, is acourse of action that is bound to cause more harm than any good that could possibly come of it.copy NO.   vo
6.      Nor do we recommend that anything should be done to reducethe number of houses and flats to be released from control.    To accept that advice would simply aggravate the difficulties for tenants, since(by and large) the smaller the free market created by decontrol, thegreater the risk of demand so far exceeding supply as to drive uprents unreasonably.7.      In our view, the only question is what can best be done to ease the transition from control to decontrol.     We know that the presentMinister of Defence had already been giving his mind to this problem,and had come to the conclusion that to allow decontrol to take effect as soon as six months after the coming into operation of the Dillwould be too abrupt.     We agree with him.8.       Our own study of the matter has led us to the conclusion that,if tenants are to be given reasonable protection against the risk of severe hardship, two things are necessary:-(a) More time must be allowed during which the effects of the Bill can begin to be felt in the provision ofmore housing accommodation, particularly by the conversion and adaptation of houses now under-occupied;        and(b) greater incentive (as well as more time) must begiven to landlords and sitting tenants to cometogether and make new tenancy agreements onreasonable terms.9.     At the same time, we regard it as important that the transitionto decontrol should not be too long drawn out.    Among otherdisadvantages, the whole object of allowing an extended period for adjustment would be likely to be defeated, because negotiations would tend to hang fire, while new accommodation might be slowerin becoming available.     We recommend that the change-over should becompleted not later than October, 1958, (instead of January, 1958, the likely date under the Bill as it stands).19. With these considerations in mind, we propose that the transitional arrangements to govern the decontrol of houses and flatsaffected by Clause 9(1) of the Bill should be modified as follows:-(a) By increasing the &quot;standstill&apos; period on rent andpossession of the higher-rated houses from 6 to15 months;  this will not only give more time forthe negotiation of new agreements, but willprotect the tenant from the risk of having to enterinto negotiations under threat of early eviction;(b) by providing that, if landlord and tenant manage toreach a new agreement for a term of not less than3 years, it may take effect as soon as it is concluded.(The tenant would get renewed security for areasonable period, certainly up to July, 1960: the landlord could secure an increased rent many months before he otherwise would:  the combined effect should be to encourage both landlords and tenantsto reach agreements on fair terms );
(c) by making unlawful the requirement of a premiumas a condition of a new agreement for the lettingof any decontrolled dwelling during the 3 yearsfollowing the coming into operation of the Bill;we think this is a valuable safeguard for sittingtenants in connection with (b) above;i(d) by retaining a minimum period of 6 months&apos; notice to quit, which cannot however take effect beforeexpiry of the 15 months&apos; standstill.11. We invite our colleagues to approve these proposals..J.S.M.H.B.12th February,1957.ANNEXALTERNATIVE SUGGESTIONS FOR EASING&quot;  TRANSITION TO DECONTROLI.      Right to possession for 3 years, coupled with appealto the Courts on rent    -   (The Marlowe proposal)The proposal is that, where a tenant has been in occupationfor the twelve months preceding the decontrol date, and where the landlord will not grant him a lease, the tenant shall be entitled toretain possession for 3 years (i.e. till after the next Election):and whether or not the landlord offers him a lease, failing agreement on rent either piarty can apply to the Court for a determination of afair rent.    Apart from the rent, the lease is to be on the same terms as the old tenancy.2.      The practical objections to the Marlowe proposal are, inour view :-(a) It means not decontrol, but for 3 years a new form of control.(b) The Courts would be overloaded, though no firmestimates of the number of cases can possibly be made.     We have consulted the Lord Chancellorabout this.(c) In the absence of a genuinely free market providingevidence of free rents, the Courts would have little to go on in fixing appropriate rents.-3-
IT.    Enforced agreements for a specific term, at specifiedrent limits    -    (The Rees-Davies proposal)This proposal gives the tenant a right to ask for an agreementof five or seven years maximum.    The rent will be limited to amaximum of 2^-times gross value;   premiums to be prohibited.2.      It is further proposed that the landlord should be able torefuse an agreement and get possession on the grounds which a land-lord can at present plead under the Rent Acts for evicting a statutorytenant - with the additional ground that the premises are wantedfor reconstruction, provided the Court is satisfied that eviction thenwould not be unreasonable.3.      The practical objections to the Rees-Davies proposal are:-(a) The proposal is the negation of decontrol.    Thebondage of the landlord to his sitting tenantwould continue for another five or seven years as strongly as now, if the tenant so wished.(b) As under the Marlowe proposal, the free marketcould not begin to operate - though the Marloweproposal does at least provide some flexibilityto adjust rents to what the Court holds to be reasonable.    The Rees-Davies proposal gives a rigid rent limit up to 1962 or 1964.     On theother hand, it places no pressure on the Courts.
