(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY O i HER BRTTANNXC MAJEST Y*S GOVERNMENT)SECRET rC.(57) 6 COPY NO._2 9th January, 1957CABINETSUEZ CANAL,    &apos;Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsNegotiations for a SettlementSince the withdrawal of Anglo-French forces from Port Saidefforts have been made, by Her Majesty&apos;s Government and byMr. Hammarskjold,   the Secretary-General of the United Nations,to resume negotiations for a settlement of the future regime of the suez Canal,     On 8th January, Sir Pierson Dixon, Permanent Representa-tive of the United Kingdom to the United Nations, was instructed toaccept a proposal, which had previously been suggested to him by theSecretary-General and had apparently originated with the EgyptianMinister of Foreign Affairs, that the negotiating Committee should include two or three small Powers in addition to Egypt, Prance and theUnited Kingdom.    Sir Pierson Dixon was further to suggest that theother members of the Committee should be Ceylon, Italy and Norway.On 21st January, the Secretary-General informed Sir Pierson Dixon thathe was asking the Egyptian Government in writing: (a) whether it was ready to resume discussions with him on the basis of the viewspreviously exchanged and summarised in the Secretary-General&apos;s letterof 24th October, and (b) what views it had as to the best means of obtain-ing the views of the Canal users.    Mr. Hammarskjold toldSir Pierson Dixon that if, as he hoped, the Egyptians left this latter question to him, the Governments he would consult would be those of theUnited Kingdom, France, Italy, Norway and Ceylon.    The EgyptianGovernments reply to this communication is still awaited.2.      The basis for negotiations, when they begin, will presumably bethe resolution adopted by the Security Council on 13th October, 1956,which listed six requirements which any settlement of the Suez question should meet.    The third of these is that &quot;the operation of the Canalshould be insulated from the politics of any country&quot;, and the fourththat &quot;the manner of fixing tolls and charges should be decided by agree-ment between Egypt and the users&quot;.    The idea of co-operation between an Egyptian Canal management and an,organisation of users is more fully developed in the Secretary-General&apos;s letter of 24th October.    Toestablish satisfactory means of co-operation between these twoelements, and an equitable balance of power between them, will be a principal objective of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the expectednegotiations.
Interim arrangements3.      Meanwhile, General Wheeler, the officer in charge of the united nations salvage fleet has announced that a channel for small and medium-sized ships will be open early in March.   It is therefore clear that the canal will be available to shipping again before there can be any hopeof concluding negotiations for its permanent regime.   There is infact good reason to suspect that the Egyptians are determined toensure this, in order that they may establish de facto an unrestrictedcontrol over the operation of the Canal and over its revenues and thusput themselves in an overwhelmingly strong bargaining position.Reported statements by Colonel Nasser indicate that he intends to denypassage to ships of any nationality refusing to pay their dues to theEgyptian Canal Authority.   If the Egyptians were to succeed in enforcing this practice, the position of the users in any subsequent negotiations would be undermined.   I have, therefore, been seeking fora means of working for an interim arrangement which would keep controlof the Canal dues out of Egyptian hands.4.      It has been estimated that the total cost of clearing the Canal willbe approximately $40 millions, of which $15 millions have already been raised by voluntary advances from a number of Governments.    TheSecretary-General hoped that the International Bank might provide therest&apos; of the money and take over the loans made by individual Govern-ments.     I therefore suggested that, since the repayment of its loan couldonly be obtained from the Canal dues and since in the absence of afinal settlement the right to the dues must remain in dispute, the Bankshould secure the guarantees it would require by itself receiving duesuntil a settlement had been negotiated.     It could make payments to Egypt for the current expenses of running the Canal.    But,apart from this, and from the sums recovered in connection withits own loan, the Bank should hold the balance of the revenues andallocate them eventually in accordance with the terms of the final settlement.    This proposal has been discussed with Mr. Black, thePresident of the Bank, and with Mr. McCloy, who is advising theSecretary-General on the finances of the Canal clearance operation.It has, however, run into two difficulties:-(a) It appears that the $15 millions already raised may besufficient to complete what General Wheelerdescribes as &quot;Stage I&quot; of the clearance, that is tosay the opening of a channel for small and medium-sized ships.    The problem of paying dues might,therefore, have to be faced before there was anyneed to agree on conditions for advancing largersums.(b) The Secretary-General is advocating (and hasmentioned to the Egyptians) a proposal for re-payment of the Canal clearance loans by meansof a surtax on the dues to be levied over a limited period.     This would effectively separate the twoproblems of payment for clearance and controlover the normal dues.
ki si5.      It will, therefore, probably be necessary to work for an interimagreement without the means of pressure which I had hoped to securethrough the International Bank.     On 24th January T instructedSir Harold Caccia, H. M. Ambassador at Washington, to represent the urgency of this problem to the Department of State, and we have sincelearnt that their Legal Adviser, Mr. Fhleger, is going to New York todiscuss the situation with Mr. Hammarskjold.    Meanwhile, I haveagreed with the French Ambassador here that we should jointlystimulate as many as possible of the other members of the Suez CanalUsers Association (S.C.U.A.) to express both to the Secretary-General ofthe United Nations and to the United States Government their belief that Egypt must be prevented from obtaining a complete de facto controlover the Canal in advance of the negotiations for its future regime.6.      I confess that I am rather pessimistic about the possibility of theusers avoiding payment of their dues direct to the Egyptian Authority.I feel that the Egyptians will insist, and that we shall either have to payin that way or continue to send our ships round the Cape.    There is one new factor since our original decision to persuade British ship-owners to pay into the Suez Canal Company&apos;s blocked account, and that is thelast of the six principles adopted by the Security Council on 13th october and accepted by Egypt.    According to that principle, &quot;in case of disputes, unresolved affairs between the Suez Canal Company and theEgyptian Government should be settled by arbitration with suitable terms of reference and suitable provisions for the payment of sumsfound to be due&quot;.    We might argue that, as Egypt needs money to work  the Canal and as the Suez Canal Company&apos;s rights are safeguarded underthe Security Council Resolution, we are justified, in common with allthe other users, in paying to Egypt pending a final settlement.7.      In spite of what I have said in the preceding paragraph, we mustnot desist from doing everything possible to avoid this situation.     Forthis purpose we must continue to work in the background in washington and New York, and to keep the members of S.C.U.A. together inLondon.S.L.Foreign Office, S. W.l.29th January, 1957.
