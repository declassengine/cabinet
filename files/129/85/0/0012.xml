secret .(57) 1228th January, 1957CABINETBRITISH SUBJECTS EVACUATED FROM egypt memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State forthe Home Department and Lord Privy&quot; SealOn 25th January the Home Affairs Committee considered amemorandum (H.A. (57) 3) on the resettlement of British refugees evacuated from Egypt (H.A. (57) 1 st Meeting, Minute 1 ).   The Committee decided anumber of points affecting the scale of national assistance to be given tothese British subjects from Government funds and set up a Sub-Committee ofMinisters to give detailed examination to the many questions of government policy which will arise during the period of resettlement.   The Sub-Committee are meeting for the first time today.2. The scale of assistance which has so far &quot;been given to Britishsubjects from Egypt has been closely related to ordinary national assistance Board scales and the hostels in which most of them are nowliving are furnished to National Assistance Board standards.   although there are obvious dangers in departing too far from the standards appli-cable to other British subjects in distressed circumstances, the general view of the Home Affairs Committee was that the plight of British subjects from Egypt justified exceptional treatment.3. The Committee agreed that subsistence payments to refugees from government funds should be calculated at a rate of at least  6 per v/eekfor a single person and that a scheme should be worked out for the paymentof resettlement grants to enable refugees to take their place in thecommunity.   This will involve the expenditure of considerable sums of exchequer money and the Committee are doubtful whether it would be rightto entrust this to the Anglo-Egyptian Aid Society.   Since then, theSooiety have themselves indicated that they would like to be relieved of the responsibility for administering the payment of grants torefugees.4. I am working on a proposal to set up a new body to deal with the resettlement &apos;cf refugees (which might be called the Anglo-egyptian resettlement Board) and to invite persons v/ho would command public confidence to serve on this Board.   This would be staffed mainly byseconded civil servants and ex-civil servants.   The Board would be financed by a Grant-in-Aid from the Exchequer.   This matter is beingconsidered this evening by the Sub-Committee and I will report their conclusions to the Cabinet.5. If we decide to set up a new Board, I would propose to make astatement in the House explaining their functions and announcing a decisionto make resettlement grants to refugees.   I hope that this will help to allay public disquiet about the treatment which they are now receiving.R.A.B.COPY NO.Home Office, S.W.1.28th January, 1957
