5 DOCUMENT IS THE	1 9 PROPERTY OF HER BRIT ANN JC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET	2	C.(57) 2 1	COPY NO. oO23 rd january	y, 1957.	CABINET	Of, SUPPLIES	Memorandum by the Minister of FowerThe O	rganisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.)have just completed the first comprehensive review of the oil situationin Western Europe as a whole.     It shows that in the first quarter of1957 supplies overall will not exceed the level of 75 per cent assumedfor planning purposes in the United Kingdom.    There is a variation,product by product - petrol 75 per cent, gas/diesel oil 85 per cent,fuel oil 60 per cent.2.    The O.E.E.C. had already agreed a scheme of allocation designedto secure an equal percentage share of available supplies of petrol,gas/diesel and fuel oil for each Member country with a reserve poolto help out those with particular difficulties.     Under these arrange-ments which operate as from 1st February the share of the UnitedKingdom for the 3 months January to March may work out as follows:-for petrol 75 per cent, for gas/diesel oil 75 per cent and for fuel oil5 5 per cent of our normal requirements.    Supplies at present programmedby the oil companies correspond reasonably closely to these levels.3.    Stocks of petrol at the start of the period were just over1,000,000 tons and with the coupon issues now planned will be reducedto 650,000 tons in April.    This is just about the minimum v/orkinglevel of stocks i. e. a month&apos;s requirements.4.    The present rationing period for petrol runs from 17th december to 17th April.    It is clear, I think, that rationing must continue untilthe end of the current period;  what we do beyond that must, I suggest,await a later assessment.5.    Stocks of gas/diesel oil in mid-December were about 750,000tons.    Substantial purchases by the companies   in the western hemisphere enabled the stock level to be raised to over 800,000 tonsin mid-January but the forward estimates show a falling trend,possibly to 700,000 tons (about 8 weeks&apos; requirements) in mid-April.6.   I feel that the current level of restrictions is about right;certainly we could not afford to relax.7.     Fuel oil is our greatest anxiety.    Mid-December stocks were1,450,000 tons.     With the present pattern of supply and consumptionthey will be down to 600,000 tons at the end of March.    The minimumworking level of stocks is 800,000 tons and this will be ensured bythe support of 400,000 tons of naval oil loaned by the Admiralty.-1-
8.   As we stand to gain rather than lose under the O.E.E.C.equalisation scheme we can see our way clear to the end of Marchwithout further restrictions.    If my colleagues are agreed on this^the sooner we tell industry the better *    We must leave decisions about April and subsequent months until the forward supply positionis clearer. -M.Ministry of Power, S.W.I.Z3rd January, 1957.
