15th &apos;. ebruary, 1957.CABINETOIL, supplies memorandum by the Minister of power the latest review of oil supplies is encouraging.     western europe as a whole should receive during the first Quarter of this&apos; year80 per cent of normal needs and in the second Quarter, with additional supplies from America   now in sight, this may rise to 90 per cent.Within these overall averages the figures for individual products varybecause of the seasonal movements of demand.     Fetrol supplies are about 90 per cent of the low winter demand but are not likely to be morethan 75 per cent of the high summer demand.    Conversely fuel oil supplies are under 80 per cent of the high winter demand but may riseto more than 90 per cent of the falling demand from April onwards.2. These figures do not allow for re-opening of the Canal or the syrian pipelines.     Even partial re-opening would effect a substantial improvement.     However, we ought not to count on this yet and so I amdriven to the conclusion, much as I dislike it, that we must prepare fora second rationing period.     We can always cancel it at short notice if circumstances permit.3. Stocks of petrol are good and they may increase a little for thetime being.    But we could only take off rationingif stocks were adequate and a wise conservation of stocks now will ensure that there is no delay in taking it off as soon as the flow of supplies permits.    At the sametime I appreciate that there is a public desire to be informed about petrolprospects for the holidays.    It would be premature to try to fix nowwhat rations in any new rationing period should be but I think we canmeet the immediate situation by allowing any coupons saved during thecurrent period to be used over the Easter holidays.4. The improvement in the fuel oil situation is most welcome.The efforts of the oil industry to increase supplies have been very successful and we can now be assured that we can get through to the endof April without increasing the present restrictions.     We cannot, however,think of any relaxation yet as we must try to build up our deflatedstocks to meet next winter&apos;s demands.5. Supplies and restricted demand, of gas/diesel oil are more orless in balance but stocks are good and I feel we can afford to lightenthe more severe cuts on industry and central heating bringing them into line with fuel oil at 1 0 per cent and 25 per cent respectively, and freeingfrom 1st April agricultural and fishing supplies from the present 10 percent restriction.SECRET-------C.(57) 37 COPY NO.

6. If my colleagues agree with these proposals I should liketo make an earLy announcement.    This might take the form annexedand could be made to both Houses of Parliament simultaneously if that is felt to be the right course.M.Ministry of Power, S W.I.,15th February, 1957.ANNEXPR A  T STATEMENT ON PETROL.AND OIL RESTRICTIONSThe measures taken to deal with the severe reductionin petrol and oil supplies, due to the closing of the Suez Canal andthe interference with pipelines in the Middle East, have brought aboutimprovements in supply compared with the position in the firstweeks of the emergency.     It is hoped that this improvement will bemaintained but any further substantial upward change depends uponthe restoration of the normal channels of supply.2. This better outlook has enabled the Government to review the restrictions now in force and to make the following announcement.Petrol3 . It remains the intention of the Government to removerationing as soon as it is practicable to do so but this depends on the assurance of an adequate and regular flow of supplies and the possessionof a working stock sufficient to ensure proper distribution.     supplies will only be adequate when shipments and distribution are restored to normal levels but meanwhile rationing has enabled the oil industryto conserve and manage its stocks in such a way that normaldistribution can be resumed as soon as supplies expand sufficiently.The Government think it prudent to proceed on the assumption that afurther rationing period will be necessary and to make arrangementsaccordingly - although such preparations and the issue of new couponswill not prevent the termination of rationing at an earlier date should this prove to be possible.4, The Government must continue to conserve stocks againstthe end of rationing, but it is deeply sensible of the desire of car owners to be able to use their cars at Easter to a greater extent than thepresent rations would permit.    As Easter falls just after the end ofthe current rationing period on 17th April arrangements will be madefor any coupons unused in the current period to be used up to theend of April in addition to the coupons for the new period.
,: fuel  Oil5. Supplies have improved and the review indicates thatrestrictions can be limited to their present level throughout April.Gas/Diesel Oil6. The restrictions can now be lightened.    As from 1st Aprilnext the cuts will be reduced to 10 per cent in the case of industryand 25 per cent for non-industrial central heating.     The restriction of 10 per cent on agricultural and fishing supplies will be abolishedfrom the same date.
