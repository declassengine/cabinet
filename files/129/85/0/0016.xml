SOCIAL SERVICES:   POSSIBLE ECONOMIESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Civil Vote-on-Ac count will be published on20th February and will be the first public indication of the level ofexpenditure next year (1957-58).    At present the Estimates submittedto the Treasury show an increase over the (revised) original estimates for this year of no less than  280 millions.    An increase of this magnitude will come as a great shock to public opinion both at homeand abroad, for there is undoubtedly a widespread feeling that our present economic difficulties call for a tighter control of government expenditure on the civil side as well as on defence.    Since we cannothope to avoid some substantial increase in civil expenditure, we must make it clear that we have made a determined effort to cut the increase to the minimum.    Not only does our political future depend on this;but it can profoundly influence our external prospects.    No singlefactor could prejudice foreign opinion about the value of sterling andour economic future so much as the feeling that Government expenditure was getting out of hand or that we were concentrating all our cuts on defence.     It is particularly important that we should check any suchfeeling now when sterling, after its recent weakness, is on the turn.2.        I propose, therefore, just before the Civil Vote-on-Account is published, to make a statement about the Estimates in Parliament.I shall have to show the main reasons for the increase;  but it is imperative that I should also be able to announce some concrete and substantial savings as an earnest of our intention to economise.3.        The ordinary Treasury scrutiny of the Estimates which isnow going on will produce some cuts.    Special attention is being givento the agricultural and food subsidies (with an eye on the forthcomingfarm price review) and to civil  defence.    But the results of all thiswill not be anything like sufficient.    Moreover, such cuts are not ofthe kind for which we can take credit publicly.4.        There is one big field in which no worthwhile economies canbe made without deliberate changes of policy  - namely, the Health and welfare Services and family allowances.     It is also the only field inwhich it is practicable to make changes which at the same time arejustifiable on their merits and will yield a sufficiently impressivetotal of economies.    Even though some of them require legislation and will take time to become effective, so that we benefit only partially in 1957-58, we shall be seen to have ensured the full saving in later years.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No.....\v.C.(57) 1630th January, 1957.CABINET
5.    Increase in the National Insurance StampIt has been suggested that the simplest method would beto put Is. or more on the insurance stamp and apply the proceeds tothe Health Service.     Is. stamp would produce  -18 millions.    Thefollowing factors should be borne in mind.(a) This is not a cut* it is a tax.    It is a regressivetax applied to wage earners, a poll tax whichwould be applied to a limited class of people in aid of a service available to all.(b) The National Insurance Fund will be in deficitnext year by about  40 millions and thereafterincreasingly each year.    We shall need to raisethe stamp as high as we can to cover thesedeficits, which threaten to undermine theinsurance basis of the scheme.     We must raise this;  with all its difficulties it is the only wayto meet the major problem which lies ahead.But there is a limit to the amount which we could put on the stamp without repercussions on wages.(c) It might be difficult to contemplate such an increase at all without providing for some increase in benefitrates, in view of the present relationship of benefits to prices.    This would increase the exchequer contribution to the Fund and wipe out, not only forthe first year but permanently, most of the savings.(d) These difficulties are not reduced in any way by theproposal to have a separate stamp for the health service.    It would in any case be mistaken toreduce the insurance stamp when heavy deficits arein prospect in the Fund.6.        I have come to the conclusion that we have to select fromthe following alternatives:-Full year saving    (G.B.)  millions(a) Abolish the dental service except for persons under 15,    saving      - 25(b) Abolish the dental service except for persons under 21 and expectant mothers, saving   - 20(c) Raise dental charges.    (Charge full cost for dentures instead of 45 percent, saving  6 millions;  and raisemaximum charge for treatments from 1 to  3).    There would be some lossthrough National Assistance - gross saving 10/(d)
Full year saving  (G.B.)  millions(d) (Raise the charge for welfare)(milk from 1 Id. to 4d. (i. e.    ) Savin (charge half the cost price) - )/ .        r i t   c \   Of lOSS(saving  12.p ;j on(Comparable charge for j producer(national dried milk  - ^ subsidy 12(saving  1.5 j(e) School milk - at present no chargecharge Id. per  ^-pint bottle, saving - 4. 5(f) School meals - at present Charge lOd;charge economic price with hardshipexemptions,    saving    - about 12(g) Grange juice, cod liver oil and vitamins;charge full cost, saving   * 1.75(Most of the supplies of orange juicefor 1957/58 have b een bought.

The Dental service the reduction in the scope of this service has the great advantage that it is a real cut.    It is a cut only on the fringe of the health Service, and if we keep the service for those under 21 andexpectant and nursing mothers we shall have protected the mostdeserving people.    Legislation would be needed, and three months&apos;notice would have to be given to the dentists.    We should therefore getno savings in the first half year.    When the service is reduced, in scopewe may have to give to dentists an option to leave the service with a rightto draw their superannuation contributions.    The effect of this cannotbe quantified precisely but it might well cancel the remaining savings in the first year.     It will be argued against this proposal that it hitsthe middle classes, and that it is the first step to dismantling the health Service,   Nevertheless this cut would be a clear demonstration of our determination to curtail Government expenditure and the fullsaving of  20 millions would be achieved in the following year, whenit will certainly be needed.8.   Charges for Existing ServicesWe could get a saving of about  40 millions in 1957/58 fr omitems (c) to (h) in paragraph 6 above.    Much of this would be effectiveimmediately.    The dental charges and hospital charge require legislation.    These charges could be defended on the ground that people
can afford to pay more than they do at present, and that there iswasteful use of these services.     For school meals I have in mind a charge of l/lOd. with hardship exemption arrangements on a uniformnational basis, which would take account both of income and thenumber of children in the family.    These cuts would of course be controversial (like anything else in this field).    We should have to face the argument that they hit the children,9.   The Family AllowanceMany people think this is a waste of money;   it is certainly not all spent on children.    There is much to be said for concentratinghelp on the larger families.     If we abolished the 8s. allowance for thesecond child there would be a net saving of about  60 millions after allowing for loss of income tax, increased national assistance, andrepercussions on war widows and national insurance allowances.To do this would worsen by 8s. a week the position of all families with two or more children.     We should have to offset this to someextent.    It might be sufficient to raise the 10s. allowance for thethird and subsequent children to 14s.    This would cost about  20millions.    A four-child family would then be in the same position asit is now, and a five-child family 4s. a week better off.    This proposalrequires legislation, and could probably not be effective before Augustso that only a proportion of the savings would be achieved this year.Conclusions10,      We ought to make economies which everyone will see arebig enough to affect the economic situation decisively.     We should therefore look for savings of at least  40 millions in the Health and welfare field in 1957/58, with a much bigger reduction in the year after.Some forms of expenditure will inevitably go up again in 1958/59, andwe should do enough now to avoid the same situation arising in a year&apos;s time, with another round of irritating cuts.11.       Financial prudence, both short-term and long-term, thereforeclearly indicates that we ought to take all the measures indicated in(b), and (d) to (i) in paragraph 6 above, yielding a total budgetary saving of  100 millions in a full year and about  55 millions in 1957/58.We should not be deterred by the fact that those measures which require legislation - reduction in the Dental Service and family allowances and the introduction of the hospital boarding charge - would give uscomparatively little saving on the Estimates for the coming year.These measures would be recognised both at home and abroad ascourageous steps which will strengthen our budgetary and economic position in the long term.    They would thus contribute to the strengthof sterling at a crucial time.     If we have the courage, these are the policies which we ought to adopt.12,       For many years, we have had the sorry spectacle of aGovernment which spends too much, drifts into inflation, then seeks tocure the situation by fiscal and budgetary measures.    These attemptsin turn lead to flagging production, taxes are reduced, and demandstimulated:  but we shrink from the measures necessary to cutexpenditure decisively, and inflation starts again.    There is only one way out of this unhappy circle, and that is to cut expenditure and not toincrease taxation - whether by way of a poll tax or by normal fiscalmeasures - but to reduce it.
13.      T have been considering what to do if we decide that, for political reasons, we dare not adopt the policy which I have outlined above.    The risks of failure to grasp the nettle now are considerable.Yet I am a politican, and I am no more oblivious of the political hazardsof firm action than T am of the economic hazards of inaction.14.      It is, in my judgment, just possible that we might get byeconomically if we decided to adopt something short of this programme,concentrating in the main on measures which will yield substantial savings in 1957/58, but at the same time expose clearly the dangersfacing us in future if more drastic measures are not taken, and announce the Governments determination to avoid them.     On this basis we would,for this year, prefer an increase in dental charges to an abolition ofpart of the Dental Service, and we would not touch family allowances.Instead, we would adopt all the remaining measures in paragraph 6, ata saving of  41 millions in 1957/58.     We would say that these savingswere clearly the minimum necessary (many would judge them entirelyinadequate) in view of the very heavy increase in Civil estimates which otherwise faces us.15.      How could be reconcile so limited a programme with our responsibility for the country&apos;s economic welfare?    Only, I suggest,by making two things quite clear:-(a) That we are able to set out in some detail the growing cost of the social services sothat we can show the dangers to the economy which this growth involves.     We would forexample give warning of the very heavy deficitswhich are in prospect for the National insurance fund.    We would explain that this does not mean that the Government intends &quot;to dismantle the welfare State&quot;:  on the contrary, it seeks ways of sustaining it without imperilling the wholeeconomy of the country.(b) That we intend to bring within bounds other areas of expenditure where at present theGovernments control does not suffice toprotect fully the tax-payer&apos;s interests.     Ofthese, much the most important example is thegrant-aided expenditure by local authorities.For this purpose an early announcement of theproposed arrangements for a general grant isessential.16.      The choices which I present to my colleagues are therefore:-(1)  The thorough-going policy outlined in paragraph 11;(2)  a less drastic policy this year (paragraph 14),accompanied by the announcements outlined inparagraph 15.    Anything less than this would, in my judgment, involve us in risks, both at home and abroad,which no Chancellor of the Exchequer can reasonably be expected to face.P.T.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.30th January, 1957.
