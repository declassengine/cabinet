RESTRICTION OF LESS ESSENTIAL CONSTRUCTIONEXPENDITUREMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. In the discussion at Cabinet on 12 September it was agreed that officials should make any possible further progress on the points raised inthe Chancellor of the Exchequer!s note on the restriction of less essentialconstruction expenditure (C(74) 99).2,        This further work suggests that the conclusion of C(74) 99 about theinappropriateness of now reintroducing the controls available under theBuilding Control Act 1966 was right.    The latest forecasts by my officialsindicate an even lower level of construction output and an even greater slackin 1974 and 1975 than was suggested in C(74) 99.    Indeed in 1975 constructionactivity could well be some 11 per cent down on 1973 and there may be at least200, 000 fewer jobs in the industry.    In this situation it would be quite impossible to justify restrictions on expenditure on construction in theprivate sector.3.        When the control was in operation in the quite different circumstances of 1966-68, only 123 projects (worth  21 million) were refused a building licence, as opposed to 1, 833 projects (worth  370 million)for which licences were issued.    The reduction in the load on the indusrty was very small - probably less than one-sixth of one per cent of a year&apos;output.    So the amounts likely to be involved in any restrictions bylicensing would be minimal.    This is not surprising: the great bulk of even private sector construction work would probably on any interpretationbe regarded as essential - eg private housebuilding, industrial building.Private office building - not all of which can be called inessential - accounts for only some 7 per cent of all new work, and private sector entertainmentfor only about 1 per cent.    Even within these small sectors there would be considerable difficulties, which were cited in C(74) 99, in deciding whichprojects were desirable or undesirable.    Moreover, without other measures, the funds and resources freed by the refusal of licence could be tdiverted to other equally undesirable uses in the private sector, involvingperhaps the purchase or hiring of existing buildings.C(75) 3 COPY NO       U19 January 1975CABINET
4. It may be argued that it is undesirable in principle, and as a matterof presentationj for less essential construction expenditure to go ahead ata time when we have to limit expenditure on public programmes.    Therestriction of private sector construction would not make it possible toincrease public sector spending, and any presentational value of anannouncement of restrictions on private work would be outweighed by theeffect cn the construction and construction materials industries whoseprospects are worsening and whose morale is already desperately low.Given the need to avoid still more damage to the industry - in loss of skilled men and production - during the very severe recession it is nowfacing, we could not justify inflicting a still further reduction in demand,especially when this would in no way help to achieve public programmes.5, If a situation of overheating should recur (and this is unlikely tobefore 1976 at the earliest) the power to reactivate the control - by Ordersubject to negative resolution in either House - exists under the building control Act 1966.    The Act exempts certain types of project from control -projects costing less than a fixed limit, private dwellings, industrial buildings and projects in development areas, development by or on behalfof the Crown and work carried out at the expense of local authorities andother public bodies.    It is unlikely that there would be any case forstopping these types of project, and the power of control therefore seemsadequate.    Technically there should be no problems in re introducing thecontrol at relatively short notice and the cost should not be large.    Themachinery therefore exists and there seems no need for furthercontingency planning.A department of the Environment7 January 19752
