EUROPEAN COMMUNITY REFERENDUM:  IMMEDIATE DECISIONSMemorandum by the Lord President of the council. Decisions are required urgently on the following issues, on someof which I set out my re commendationsINFORMATION policy a. Government Information (C(75) 8 paragraphs 3-5)i. The Government should undertake an informationeffort, starting at about the end of February with factual information about the European Community and extendinglater to the preparation of material as a basis for presenting,subsequent to the Government verdict, the outcome of renegotiation and its implications for the country.ii. For this purpose a special interdepartmental unitshould be established in the Cabinet Office; the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary, as Chairman of the ministerial committee on European Questions, should assume ministerial responsibility for its programme.b. Control of other information activities (C(75) 8paragraphs 6-11)Further thought should be given to the limitation of expenditure bythe control of propaganda activities;    This should include -i. The possible imposition of limits on specified activitiessuch as national newspaper advertising and hoardingadvertising.ii. Informal contact with the Chairmen of the british broadcasting Corporation and the Independent broadcasting authority for the purpose of consultation about thearrangements they will be making in order to maintain the fair balance required. ......1C(75) 12 COPY NO     &apos;4 822 January 1975CABINET
iii. The possibility of Government assistance to the outside organisations - perhaps not by way of financialcontributions, but by arranging for the free distribution ofcertain information material.iv. The possibility of banning public opinion polls.ORGANISATION OF REFERENDUM POLL2. c. Poll size and question of majority (C(75) 9 paragraphs 2-6)At this stage we should do no more than make clear that we intend to be guided, as far as possible, by normal Parliamentary electionpractice,d. Poll count and announcement (C(75) 9 paragraphs 7-10)We should decide now whether to count locally (by constituencies orcounties) or to investigate the possibility of a central count.    Thelatter option would require early decision and action to reserve the accommodation which would be required.3. A decision is also required on whether or not we should publish a white Paper in late February as a basis for a Parliamentary debate.E privy Council Office22 January 19752
