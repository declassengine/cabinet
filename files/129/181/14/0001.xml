C(75) 1424 January 1975COPY NOooCABINETBBC LICENCE FEENote by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentIt has been agreed that the British Broadcasting Corporation Licence Feewill be discussed in Cabinet on 28 January, and I therefore attach for theinformation of my colleagues the paper which will be considered by the broadcasting Committee on 27 January.    I shall report the view of theCommittee orally to the Cabinet.R H j home Office24 January 1975
BBC LICENCE PEEMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Home DepartmentWe have to decide what increase to make in the BBC licence fee.It was last increased in 197*1 from  6 (monochrome) and  11 (colour)to  7 and  12 respectively..     Licence fees are not the only possible way of financing the BBC, but until the Annan Committee reports, wecould not, without pre-empting a significant part of its work,depart from the fee- as the source of revenue..     We have to take adecision in the very near future to enable a new fee to operate soon,.It takes 2-3 months to bring a change into effect:-,     By the end ofFebruary the BBC will have a deficit of over  10m, which exceedstheir present temporary borrowing powers and any further delay will cause the deficit to continue to accumulate.     The BBC have had to cut some programmes now to contain the deficit at the present level.,2o     To coyer the deficit and the estimated costs of maintaining the BBC services at their present-levels over the next 4 years wouldrequire an increase from  7 to  9 (monochrome) and  12 to  18 (colour)(the balance could be altered)0     Even1this increase may not keep pace with mounting costs-     What we have essentially to decide isthe balance to strike between an increase in the fee and cuts in theserviceso     It would be exceptionally difficult to justify a refusal to make any increase in the  licence  revenue and to relywholly on cuts to balance the books (and to repay borrowing).     Sucha decision would have devastating consequences to the BBC     On theother hand, in the present economic situation, I think that it wouldbe wrong to give the BBC everything they want.     We should have some increase and some. cuts.     The- situation is set out in detail in annex A.3o     The main factors that we have to take into account are:a)   Public DemandIt is hard to generalise on how far the public wouldbe prepared to pay a higher price for the present level ofserviceo   Previous licence fee increases have not reduced- &apos;   demand.
&quot;c)   Mature of the GutsWe do not attempt to control the day-to-dayexpenditure of the BBC, but it is clear that a merereduction of the apparent lavishness of presentationwill fall far short of what is needed.     The kind ofcuts entailed by a range of different increases in Ithe licence fee are shown in Annex B.     At certainlevels of fee there will be severe redundancies,c) . The IBAFalling advertising revenue is now having a mostsevere effect on the independent television companies and is likely to cause them to cut their programmes;but to what extent is not yet clear,d) Pay increases the BBC gave their staff a pay increase of 26 percent.     This was done without consultation with theGovernment.    I think that it is right to bring home to large corporations the consequences of extravagantpay   settlements e,g, future redundancies,e) Concessions to the DisadvantagedThe higher the increase the more pressure therewill be.to make concessions to pensioners and the disabled:    concessions which up till now have been hresisted on the ground that increases in the cost ofliving should be dealt with by social security upratings,not by piecemeal adjustments.     Putting the bulk of theincrease on colour rather than monochrome licences is .a help here,f) New ServicesCuts in existing services would make the prospectof new services less favourable.     In particular boththe Welsh 4th Channel and the broadcasting of parliament would have to be considered on the basis of separatesubventions,4,     I consider that the choice before us is either to give the bbc the full licence fee increase they are in reality demanding -namely  9 (monochrome) and  18 (colour) - or else a significantlysmaller amount,     I favour the latter approach,     I consider thatthe licence fee should be raised from  7 to  8,59 (monochrome)and from  12 to  17 (colour).     This would be likely to cause a sharp but not intolerable degree of reduction in service, andif the rate of inflation proved to be less than assumed as thebasis of such reduction, the existence of an accumulated deficitwould operate to keep the BBCs expenditure within reasonable2
bounds-     I think that a reassessment will he required in twoyears.     Another possibility is to index the level of the licence fee to the retail price index.     However, I can see serious objections to such a course.     The Treasury does not support theidea.5o     I recognise that whatever decision we make may lead to political difficulties and may also have considerable consequenceson the future of public service broadcasting in this country.,I would therefore welcome the views of the Committee before thematter goes to the Cabinet.EHJHome OfficeSW122 January 1975r3
ANNEX a licence FES : TIE BBCS FINANCIAL POSITION   -1        The piresent BBC licence fee is  ?.00 (monochrome) and  12.00 (colour).The EBC formally asked for an increase in July.   The question has been in abeyance during the election period and while the PESC review was completed.2        The BBC forecast that, on present licence fees and with their presentexpenditure commitments, they face a deficit of  2d6million by 31 March 1975, 75, million by 31 March 1976,  150.3 million by 31 March 1977,  256.8 million by 31 &quot;March 1978, and  ffOOlmillion by 31 March 1979.   These figures take no account of recently announced cuts in programme hours, expected to producesavings of  1 million in a full year.   This therefore makes no impact on thecurrent problem.   They had asked for an increase in the licence fees from1 January 1975, and, since an increase in the licence fees has been delayed until after they have also askedthenyfor an increase in their temporary borrowing powers,   They have not formally asked for particular figures for the licence fees but they have pointedout that, if their forecasts are right, they would be able to last for threeyears without further increases if the licence fees were increased to  9 formonochrome television and  18 for colour television.   They have not publiclynamed these figures, although Sir Michael Swarm, the Chairman of the BBC,talking to the Broadcasting Press Guild on 17 October admitted in reply to questions, to the possibility of  2 on monochrome fee and of making the colourfee twice the monochrome fee.3       The BBC have been told that their estimates are not yet accepted as sound, butin any case it has not been possible to increase the licence fees from January1975.     It takes at least two/three months for the Post Office to arrange for anincrease in the licence fees.   The most immediate problem is the short-termprospect.   Under their Royal Charter the BBC are allowed (-without the need for
Government consent) to borrow up to  10 million for temporary bankingaccommodation and (with the consent of the Home Secretary) a further-20 million for capital expenditure.   The BBC have always used the  10 millionborrowing power fairly freely,but have never used the capital borrowing powers since the war on the ground that they were an ultimate reserve only,to be kept for a period of real emergency.   As expenditure by the BBC doesnot create revenue, but only a burden which will presently have to be paid off,with interest, by future licence holders, the BBC should not become dependenton long-term borrowing.k        The need for some licence fee increase as early as practicable,operative from April 1975* cannot be challenged, and the immediate need foran increase to cope with the deficit that would otherwise arise in 1975-76is also not open to question since both these problems are beyond solution bythe use of borrowing powers or of particular economies, arising as they dofrom forward commitments.5        The amount of increase required and its timing depend to a large extent on the validity of the income and expenditure figures used in the BBCsforecasts.   These are shown, together with actual figures from ?l/?2, at appendix 1.   A .line has been included to take account of PBS savings of 2.1 million (r/k Survey prices) which is estimated to be equivalent to 35 million at outturn prices over the period to 1978-79*   On the income side,the BBC used licence revenue forecast figures provided by the Home Officeearlier. We do not expect that these figures will quite be achieved (because ofthe fall in the rate of growth of colour television licence revenue over thelast few months, a result mainly of the hire purchase controls on colour television imposed in December 1973)*   The difference, at the current level offee, would be about  15 million up to 1978/79.
6        Of the BBC s expenditure of about  1167 million before interest up to1978/79* they suggest some  ^62 million is due to rising costs on existing services.This figure is very speculative, being 18&amp;,11$,12%,13$ and 11$ per year respec-tively up to 197^/79.  50 million is included for developments (about      up to78/79&apos;   Capital expenditure increases by about  30m in total up to 78/791 even after PE.S savings.7     .  There are three major factors bearing on the BBCs forecast of expenditure.   &apos;First, pay: in the forecast, the BBC allowed for the pay increases they awardedthis year (26%). Over the next three years, this increase costs about  25 million   ;extra over and above what would have been an acceptable level of increase. For the .four years from April 1975 they have allowed for more reasonable basic pay awards   jof 12 , 10 , 1C$ and 10%&apos;.   Secondly, j/capital expenditure.   The cuts in capital expenditure which we have required ofthe BBC, in the context of the recent PESC review will save about  55 million at outturn prices.   Thirdly, the prospect of savings.   The forecasts allow fora small amount of additional programme spendingj mostly outside London, and the bbc argue, with some force, that standards have already fallen dangerously low.For example, the number of repeats during the main evening viewing hours has in early doubled over the last five years.   The number of cinematograph filmsshown on BBC TV has also increased to a level greater than the BBC like andwhich prompts some protests from the viewers.   On the other hand there areprogrammes on v/hich a great deal of money has been spent, sometimes (as the bbc themselves px^ivately admit in the case of the October 197&apos;f general electioni1programme) unsuccessfully.   The BBC say that without a sufficient licence fee jincrease they would have to cut the volume of output.8        As regards the period v/hich should be covered by any adjustment to thelicence fee it is assumed that any arrangement should ideally cover Ihe period up to 1979, when the Charter expires, and any new arrangements arising from the
Annan Report should come into effect.9       Before consideration can be given to any increase in the licence fee, itis necessary to be satisfied that the BBC operates on an economic basis.While there can be legitimate doubts about the value/cost of certain programmes,this expenditure   springs from judgements about the merits of programmes, amatter in which it is to be expected that mistakes are made.   The area of programme-making is one in which the Government has no role, and to whichit is not possible to bring more than broad criticisms, which have to bebased on a long period, rather than in relation to particular programmes. Itis possible, however, to apply tests to general operating costs by comparing the output of ITV.   On this basis BBCs television programme costs for the fiscal year 197^-7^ were  90m   operating costs plus  8.7m depreciation, total 98.7m.   Programme output hours totalled about 10,700, a cost.,,per programmehour of  9,200.   Total ITV costs for the year to July 197^ were  111 million,perhaps  10^- million on a comparable basis, which for 9,300 programme hoursof broadcasting for 1973-7^ gives about  11,200 per hour.   Though the comparison is not exact, this suggests that BBC operating costs are not excessive.10       There are areas within the scope of the BBCs expenditure which give riseto concern.   In particular there are grounds for thinking that the corporation is less commercially oriented than is consistent with the need to postpone or until the last two years, it has beensoften the impact of increased licence   fees.  At least/less successful thanIITV in selling programmes and technical developments over?   .s,   While, therefore,there is room for improvement, and a&apos;requirement to make this effective canbe linked with any increase that is awarded, the most than can be expected wouldbe of the order of  3 to &amp;k million.   This would not significantly affect thelevel of licence fee increase.
11        If the BBC expenditure figures were to be accepted as a basis forcalculating licence revenue - and the figures embody assumptions abov*rising costs which may be unrealistically low - tfa*&quot; 1S a need toprovide for additional revenue of A licence fe^   level whichwould accommodate this &quot;^-Cu be  9 mono and  18 for a colour licence, i.e.an increase of &amp;a ^LZi.    ?he effect of this level of licence fee is shownat Appendix 2.   The effect of various alternatives are shown in Appendix 3*12       If it is accepted that the BBC should run with a continuing deficit,attracting interest charges, (which in itself brings pressure to bear on the bbc to curb expenditure), it becomes possible to consider an alternative scheme which has the advantage of making it possible to start with a lowerincrease to the fee, on the basis that there are progressive increases throughoutthe period linked to the RPI.13       This system has marked advantages in that the BBCs income would increase at the same pace as the licence holders, and no faster.   The BBCwould have to limit growth in their expenditure to this standard.In practise the likely operation would be that the monochromelicence is increased to  8 from 1 April 1975&apos;   If the retail price index figurespublished by the Department of Employment for September 1975 exceeds the figure..for September 197*1- by less than 7 per cent, the licence fee at 1 April 1976would remain unchanged at  8.00,   If the September 1975 index figure were&apos; between 7 per cent and &quot;]k per cent   greater   than   the. September   197V&apos;       &quot;-. -figure, the licence fee would increase to  8.50 on 1 April 1976,   If the indexrose by between 1*f and 21 per cent or by between 21 and 28 per cent, the feeon 1 April 1976 would increase to  9 or  9,50,   Increase of double the amount would be made to colour licence fees, and increases on the same principle wouldbe allowed in April 1977 toad 1978.
/-\k       The BBC will reach the limit of their temporary borrowing powers by theend of February 1975 (see paragraph 3)&apos;   They have in addition borrowing powersup to  20 million for capital expenditure with the authority of the Secretary ofState.   Since no decision on a licence fee will be available until the end ofJanuary 1975 and it takes 2/5months to put into effect,  the BBC will need to have authority to borrow when their temporary borrowing powers are exceeded in March.-It is unlikely that the level of licence fee increase agreed will remove the deficit or reduce it below  10 million for long.   It has been necessary therefore to authorise them to have access to capital borrowing powers and with treasury approval this authority has been-&apos;given*

ANNEX BThe 13130 have calculated that the various possibilities in respect of licence feeswould leave them with deficits as shown in Appendix 1 to this annex.   These allassume, however, an expenditure pattern on the basis that the BBC output remainsas it is.   If this were to be cut, the outcome would be different.   It seemsinescapable that some cuts should be expected, in line with other public expenditure.It has to be remembered, however, that the BBC is a labour intensive organisation.Cuts will therefore mean redundancies, and will involve negotiations with theUnions,   This will introduce a delay before the benefit of the cuts can be realised.Cuts which the BBC would make would be from amongst the following and the size of the cut, or cuts, would depend upon the severity of the financial saving sought.The table at Appendix 2 to this annex shows the BECs assessment of the order and intensity of the cuts required under various licence fee options all assuminginflation at 21$, 1l$, 1&apos;$.1.
