C(75) 4 COPY no. 7 January 1975CABINETTHE LUMP - THE GENUINELY SELF-EMPLOYEDMemorandum by the Minister for Planning and Local Government1. At its meeting on 2 December the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Policy were, on balance, in favour of my scheme, provided thatit could be modified so as to incorporate a safeguard for the genuineself-employed sub-contractor who met his tax and national insuranceobligations and the other criteria laid down by Phelps Brown in his report.2.        This paper clarifies my proposals in relation to the genuinelyself-employed.    The Phelps Brown report said that most of the men whowere genuinely in business on their own account were engaged in repair and maintenance and minor alterations, and worked direct to clients not themselves engaged in construction; but that on occasion they might takework under sub-contract in new construction (Cmnd 3714, paragraph 423).Under my original proposals no levy liability would arise where, followingPhelps Brown, a genuine self-employed person operated as a contractor toa private client or, where he operated as a sub-contractor, he engaged atleast one employee, again following Phelps Brown.3.        I recognise the real concern of colleagues about the position of thegenuinely self-employed and, in order to meet this, I propose the followingmodification to my scheme.    Where a genuine self-employed personcomplied with the Inland Revenue&apos;s tests as revised he could be treated fora period of two years from the introduction of the scheme as registered under the Act, so that no levy liability would arise if he operated as asub-contractor.    At the end of two years he could be registered only if hehad become the employer of at least one person;  alternatively, he couldbecome a direct employee.    Allowing for the time in setting up the scheme,a genuinely self-employed person would thus have at least three years inwhich to decide how to arrange his affairs for the future.4.        This seems to me to give a fair deal to all those concerned and toremove any element of hardship which might be thought to arise under myoriginal proposals.    At the same time, it would smooth the transition tothe ultimate objective which, I am sure, we must still maintain, namely to abolish the lump.1
5. On the penal levy referred to in paragraph la of the Central policy review Staff memorandum (C(75) 2) I am prepared to agree to a 30 per concentrate instead of 40 per cent as I originally proposed. I should make clearthat the penal levy is paid by the contractor employing lump labour. It isnot paid by members of the lump. Further, the 30 per cent tax deduction from members of the lump is simply to meet their tax liability.6.        I invite my colleagues to agree to these modifications.J department of the Environment7 January 19752
