REFERENDUM:  THE QUESTION ON THE BALLOT paper memorandum by the Lord President, of the council. The referendum Question on the ballot paper will have to beincluded in the referendum Bill and thus decided by Parliament.    But in theWhite Paper on referendum arrangements, we must give a lead on the government&apos;s view about the wording of the Question.2. The exact words are important, and there are several problems!i. Should the Question refer to &quot;we&quot;, &quot;Great Britain&quot; or &quot;theUnited Kingdom&quot;?    &quot;We&quot; is simple but imprecise.    &quot;GreatBritain&quot; or &quot;Britain&quot; is familiar but inaccurate because itexcludes Northern Ireland.    &quot;The United Kingdom&quot; is technicallycorrect and emphasises that we are asking people to take anational decision.ii. Should the Question refer to &quot;the Common Market&quot;, &quot;the eec&quot; or &quot;the European Community&quot;?    &quot;Common Market&quot; isfamiliar but, like &quot;the e.c.&quot;, not technically correct.&quot;European Community&quot; is accurate now that the three originalCommunities have been merged, and no-one is likely to misunder-stand it.iii. Should the Question include the phrase &quot;do you think that&quot; or some variant?    &quot;Think&quot; is less loaded than any other simple word.iv. Should the Question use the word &quot;stay&quot; /a. member of theEuropean Community;/ or &quot;be&quot;? &quot;Stay&quot; was the word used in the october Manifesto,v. Most difficult of all, should the Question refer to therenegotiations of the new terms?    The October Manifesto said:&quot;We will give the British people the final say which will be binding on the Government - through the ballot box - on whether we acceptthe terms and stay in or reject the terms and come out&quot;.0 iC(75) 18 COPY NO10 February 1975CABINET
3. Several people are already offering advice.    The General Secretaryof the Labour Party has suggested:&quot;Do you think that ...We should stay in the Common Market?We should come out of the Common Market?The European Movement have suggested:  &quot;Do you wish the United kingdom to remain a member of the European Community on the new termsnegotiated by the Government and recommended by Parliament?&quot;   Anothersuggestion is that the wording should be simply:  &quot;Should Great Britain bea member of the Common Market?&quot;4. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office recommends that we should propose the following in the White Paper:i. At the head of the ballot paper there should be printed &quot;TheEuropean Economic Community (Common Market) was formed in1957 by six countries: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy,Luxembourg and the Netherlands.    Denmark, Ireland and the United &amp;Kingdom joined on 1 January 1973.    The Government has announced the results of the renegotiation of the United Kingdom&apos;s terms of membership of the European Community&quot;.ii. Separately, and in different type, the Question itself should run:&quot;Do you think that the United Kingdom should stay in the european community ?YesNo5. I myself consider the preamble in paragraph 4i. rather long and suggest that my colleagues might consider using the last sentence of it only.    &quot;Be&quot;mightbe an alternative to &quot;stay&quot; in the Question inparagraph 4ii,E privy Council Office10 February 1975
