REFERENDUM:  INFORMATION ACTIVITIES OF OUTSIDE ,&apos;ORGANISATIONSMemorandum by the Lord President of the council. On 23 January the Cabinet asked me to give further consideration to possible arrangements for controlling the information activities of outsideorganisations (CC(75) 5th Conclusions, Minute 6).    We need to reachprovisional conclusions on these issues before drafting of the promisedWhite Paper can go very far.OUTSIDE INFORMATION ACTIVITIES2. When we last discussed this we decided against banning publicopinion polls and recognised that attempts to limit total expenditure by thetwo sides were unlikely to be effective.    This is also the view of theGeneral Secretary of the Labour Party.3. There could be only one reason for attempting to limit expenditure by the two sides.    That would be to ensure a fair balance in the presentation of both sides of the argument.    I beLieve that that can be achieved better byother means.4. But requirements on sponsoring bodies, as in elections, to includetheir names and addresses on all printed campaign material and to make a return of expenditure after the event might have some deterrent effect andwould be presentationally useful.    This is on the understanding that asatisfactory way could be found to define the expenditure which has to be disclosed and the persons or bodies subject to the obligations and to ensurethat the obligations were seen to be really effective..5, The Annex examines some other possibilities.    But in my view thecase for going beyond the ordinary electoral controls so as to prohibit orlimit these other activities is outweighed by the need to avoid measureswhich would damp down public interest.    We all want a high poll.    the chances of this would be much reduced by a muted campaign.    And if wesought in the Referendum Bill to take powers of this kind (contrary to the1C(75) 17 COPY NO     817 February 1975CABINET
practice in other countries) we would certainly make it harder to get it through Parliament quickly.    I propose that we should give all this anairing in the White Paper but, on the assumption that there will be an appropriate Government information effort, come down against any restrictions.BROADCASTING6. Television is now much the most important medium for politicalcampaigning, and we must get the arrangements right.    Discussions are continuing with the broadcasting authorities, and I will report to mycolleagues about this aspect when they have made more progress.    TheCommittee on Party Political Broadcasting will need to approve these arrangements,CONCLUSIONS7. I invite my colleagues to agree that, subject to a final decision when we consider the draft of the White Paper -i. We should require sponsoring bodies to include their names and addresses on all printed campaign material and to make a return after the referendum of money spent to promote their case(paragraph 2).ii. There should be no restriction on information activities by outside organisations (paragraph 3).E privy Council office February 19752
ANNEXRESTRICTIONS ON INFORMATION ACTIVITIES OP OUTSIDE BODIESAdvertisements on Television and RadioPolitical advertisements are already prohibited by paragraph 8 of schedule 2 to the Independent Broadcasting Authority Act 1973 -There is no doubt that this extends to advertisements about our membership of the European Community.Press^Advertisements2.     It might be possible to extend to advertisements in the press,for the duration of the referendum campaign only, a prohibitionof advertisements about our membership of the European Communitysimilar to that which already applies to television.    This would need legislation and there would be problems of definition(national, regional, local and weekly papers?) and coverage(restrictions on announcements of meetings?), quite apart from theissue of principle.3.     The impact on a national campaign of advertisements on hoardingswould probably be negligible, and effective enforcement before the damage has been done would be difficult.&apos;Paid Canvassers4.     The former practice of paying canvassers is made an illegalpractice by section 96 of the Representation of the People Act,1949-    That provision applies to the election of a candidate; fora referendum it would have to be adapted to refer to achieving a particular result in the polio    This was the course followed in the Northern Irish Border Poll and there would be nodifficulty in making a similar adaptation for the referendum.Activities by Employers and Trade Unions5.     Some employers may seek to influence the views of their employees by warning them in factories and offices of the dangers to their jobs of one outcome or another of&apos;the referendum.    Tomake this and corresponding activities by trade -unions an offencemight be damaging to industrial relations.    At most, it seemspreferable merely to use the White Paper to urge restraint.1 February 1975Hoarding Advertisements
