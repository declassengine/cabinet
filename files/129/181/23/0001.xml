e.c. RENEGOTIATION: REGIONAL AIDS AND STEELMemorandum by the Prime Minister1. The Committee on European Community Strategy (ECS) have reviewed the progress towards our renegotiation objectives on regionalaids and steel policy.    Our Election Manifesto of February 1974 stated thatour objective would be &quot;the retention by Parliament of those powers overthe British economy needed to pursue effective regional, industrial andfiscal policies&quot;.I.   REGIONAL AIDS2.        When the Cabinet discussed this question last September, conflictingarguments were put forward on this question.    On the one hand, it waspointed out that the European Economic Community (e.c.) Treaty was concerned with preventing state aids which distort competition in so far asit affects trade between Member States.    We did not want to damage othercountries&apos; trade, and we did not want their aids to damage our regions.Some Ministers therefore argued the pragmatic case that our essentialobjective was to establish that we should be able to follow the regional policies we required (and in that context to take quick action if necessary and justify it after the event), since the Manifesto commitment is in termsof &quot;the powers needed to pursue effective regional .... policies&quot;.    On theother hand, other Ministers emphasised the formal legal position, that theCommission have power to act under the Treaty and to take Member states to the European Court of Justice.    They argued that the power ofParliament to make regional policies could be effectively safeguarded, inaccordance with the Manifesto, only by finding some ways of avoidingCommunity involvement which went beyond the reporting of aids and inter-Governmental consultation about them,3.        After full discussion of all these considerations, the Cabinet came to the conclusion (CC(74) 34th Conclusions) that Community rules for theco-ordination of national regional aids were in our interests because of therestraints imposed on other Governments, provided that they werecompatible with our need to be free to follow the regional policies were quired.    The Cabinet laid down five specific principles which theCommunity rules should satisfy.C(75) 23 COPY NO25 February 1975CABINET
4.        We have had intensive discussions with the Commission, whohave produced a communication indicating how the provisions of the EECTreaty will apply to regional, aids.    Member Governments will shortly beinvited to record their agreement to this communication by passing aresolution in the Council of Ministers.5.        The communication meets the five principles specified by theCabinet - as follows: -a. The Community should not rule out a priori any form of aidlikely to prove effective.No forms of aid are ruled out by the communication.b. There should be no doctrinaire exclusion of forms of aid,notably labour and production subsidies, such as the regional employment Premium, on the ground that they are not related toinvestment and are not therefore &quot;transparent&quot;.The communication specifically accepts that the presence or lack of&quot;transparency&quot; does not prejudge the compatibility of aids with theCommon Market.c. The arrangements for reporting or consultation about aidsshould not hinder urgent action.The communication states that, where changes to aid systems are justified by essential national problems requiring an urgentresponses they shall be considered compatible with the common market.d. We should be able to vary the boundaries of our regions inthe light of our assessment of need and when we judge it to benecessary.The communication explicitly accepts that national Governments arethe best judges of which is required in their own countries.    Thestatement about the factors requiring an urgent response useslanguage derived directly from the Local Employment Act 1972.e. Any classification of the Community into areas for thepurpose of the rules should take account of the complexity and special character of regional problems.The communication replaces the present division of the Communityinto central and peripheral areas with a new classification into fivecategories which takes close account of the differing circumstances prevailing in different areas of the Community.2
6.        So far as the constitutional aspect is concerned, we must accept thatthe e.c. Treaty gives the Commission certain formal powers in respect of regional aid systems.    But in the communication the Commission declaresin effect that there will be no interference with the regional policies theGovernment needs to pursue;  and for these the Government will remainwholly answerable to Parliament.    The political reality, which our experience on many matters over the last 12 months has demonstrated, isthat the Member States in the Council of Ministers can determine the effective substance of Community control over regional aids and other questions.7.        The majority of ECS accordingly took the view that the Manifestoaim had been met in relation to &quot;the powers needed to pursue effectiveregional policies&quot;.    We should therefore accept the CommissionJscommunication in the Council of Ministers, subject to the need for parliamentary debates, which should take place on a &apos;take note&apos; motion inMarch and before the Council formally approves the necessary resolution,II.    STEEL8,        The issue of control over steel presents special difficulty -notwithstanding the political realities of the European Community.Community rules about steel rest almost entirely on the provisions of theEuropean Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) Treaty, which dates from an earlier period than the e.c. Treaty and reflects anxieties arising from thedevelopment of the German steel industry under State influence before thelast war.    The Commissicn is required to act as the custodian of theTreaty provisions.9.        From the pragmatic angle, our experience of the Treaty has been to some extent reassuring, at least in some areas.    We have been able to influence the British Steel Corporation (BSC) over price increases;  and,although we cannot exercise comparable pressure on prices in the private sector, these normally follow the BSC lead.    We have had experience of several cases involving the Commission^ consent under the Treaty to individual mergers, and we are currently watching how the Commissionreact to the Governmenfs purchase of a holding in Johnson, Firth, Brown.We must ensure that there is no misunderstanding on the part of theCommission of our policy over public ownership of the steel industry.There is no doubt that the Community accept the principle of nationalisationas such.10.       So our experience of the operation of the Treaty so far has been thatit has not in practice prevented us from influencing steel prices andmergers: though a question mark must remain until the Johnson, Firth,Brown case has been completed satisfactorily.3
11.        But in one important respect the Treaty position is not satisfactory.There is no problem about investment in the public sector; but it appearsthat the Treaty would not permit us to reassume, if we wished, the powers in section 15 of the Iron and Steel Act 1967 to control investment in theprivate sector.    The Conservative Government repealed section 15 onjoining the e.c..    The result is that we as a Government do not have thepower - nor indeed does the Commission - to ban any private steel project,(for example the Cosmex mini-mill at Newport) which might be judgedundesirable.12.       At the outset of renegotiation we made clear to the Community thatwe should feel free to propose Treaty amendments if it emerged that changesin policies and decisions would be insufficient to meet our essential interests.    It is now clear that we need an overhaul of the ECSC Treaty -going wider than the investment provisions.13.        We cannot hope to reach agreement in the Community on the revision of the Treaty within the renegotiation timescale.    Other member governments are not going to commit themselves to the lengthy andarduous process of Treaty amendment until they know that we areremaining members.    In any event, we need to have a clearer viewourselves on the precise powers which we need for controlling investment;on the options open for securing and applying those powers;  and on theother aspects of the Treaty which need revision.14.       In the circumstances, the majority of ECS concluded that weshould give notice now to the other Governments that if, as a result of the referendum, we stay in the e.c., we shall press for an overhaul of theECSC Treaty, particularly in relation to the issues which have concerned us.CONCLUSION15.       I invite the Cabinet to endorse the conclusions in paragraphs 7 and14, on the handling of our renegotiation objectives on regional aids and steel.H W10 Downing Street25 February 19754
